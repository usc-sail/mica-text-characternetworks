I don't see her.
The shift change is late.   Just wait.
sighs and stares back at the lift lane.
Are you sure about this?
We've been doing this forever. Trust me. This lady loves Lynch. She always goes for it.
I'm cute.
Is um... is that her?
Shit.
Dude.
It's cool, it's cool.  Look, all you have to do is smile real pretty and tell him-
-What?   Me? No way.    This is your thing.
-GIRLfriends. Say "girlfriends".
-you and your girlfriends forgot your credit card and you can't pick up your lift tickets.
Start at $50. That's what we usually give the other lady. He'll take it. Trust me.
Dan, no.   You do it.    I feel stupid.
You've got this.    You can totally do this.
Parker, you've so got this.
The worst thing that happens is he says no. He won't say no. No one ever says no.
Why me?
`Cause you're a girl.
A very beautiful girl with a very charming smile. 
There.
My charming smile?
Hey.
Could I bum a smoke?
Thanks.
I'm Parker.
Jason.
Oh, cool.    My brother's name is Jason.
OK.
Yeah, so I don't want to waste your time and bullshit you cause you seem like a wicked busy guy and everything...but..this is gonna sound so stupid...
My girlfriends and I drove all the way up here from Salem State, and I was sort of the dumbass who told everyone that I could cover the lift tickets on my Mom's credit card...but then I left her credit card at the gas station...and so...
Right.
No- but I mean, we totally have some cash and stuff. We just don't have enough to cover all 3 lift tickets, you know?
How much?
Like...fifty?
I could lose my job.
He's not going for it.
Will you shut up? He's gonna go for it. It's either stand there and do the job for minimal... minimal, what is it?
Minimum.
-Minimum wage or do it for minimum wage plus a little bit more.
She had to come skiing with us?
You said you didn't mind?
I don't.   I don't mind.   Don't mind at all.
I'm just saying, you haven't done dollar pitchers at Fezziwigs with
For ten minutes, Dan. Football games are more than ten minutes.
Dude, I have a girlfriend now. I love this girl. I don't know what you...
No, no it's fine. I'm just saying, the Mount Holliston day trips were our thing, you know? She doesn't even know how to board yet.
She's getting better.  Now I feel like a dick. You should have said something if it was a problem.
It's not a problem. It's not. Forget I ever said anything.
Good work!     See?   They always go for it.
I did good, right?
You did great.
Oh, so where's my change?
There isn't any.
You gave him the full hundred?
He wasn't going for it at 50.
I would have asked for change.
It's still way cheaper than paying for tickets, right?
I would have definitely asked him for change.
 "Girlfriends"?
Look at that. See? All these other idiots are paying top dollar to ski. Not us. All thanks to you, baby.
 Oh, now I'm "baby"?     You never call me pet names.
I'm just not a `pet name' guy.
 He calls me "Parker."
It's your name.
Yeah but you're supposed to call me something affectionate, you know? Like "honey" or "sweetie".
I hooked up with a girl last semester that called me by my last name in bed. It was so weird. "Oh, Lynch! Your hair is so soft! Do me harder, Lynch!" It was like I was throwing it to Dan over here.
See? At least I don't call you "O'Neil".
You don't touch my face enough either.
EMPTY_LINE
Hey, that's not fair. I'm not dating you, you don't get to make my life suck.
Wha-? I never said that. I never said you make my life suck.  Sweetie.
 Dan tells me you're getting the hang of that board?
I wouldn't say that. But last time we went I did pretty good, right?
You did awesome. I'm telling you, the first few times are frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it's like riding a bike.  DAN  Are you gonna trade in those ancient things for a board?
Please. Snowboards are too EMO for me. Give it ten more years and that fad will be dead.
That's what they said about rap.
Mmm-mmm. Smell that fresh mountain air, huh? Kind of smells like... cancer.
You know what, I am so sick of potheads giving me shit about smoking butts.
At least pot does something for you. Cigarettes are just gross. Especially out in the cold. It like sticks to you and then you smell like a mixture of ash tray and an old man's used floss.
Used floss? Where do you come up with this shit.
No, I have never- why would I ever sniff my floss? Why am I friends with you?
Gimme a drag.
What time do you think we'll get back? I have about 2 weeks worth of chapters to read tonight.
Oh no. She broke the rule.
No worrying about the bullshit of real life. The whole point of this
But, I haven't read a-

Uh-oh! Is someone afraid of heights?
No.
So it doesn't bother you when I do this?
Quit it!
I'm not afraid of heights.   I just
Baby, in the whole history of time, only one chair has ever fallen off
Points for calling me "baby" but you just made that statistic up.
Yeah, statistics don't work on smokers.
OK, WHAT ASSHOLE COULDN'T GET ON THE CHAIR RIGHT?
COME ON, I PAID GOOD MONEY TO DO SOME SKIING!
Actually, I paid good money.
Yeah, but I'm gonna pay you back so it's like the same thing.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! WOO!
Why do I have to wear a helmet?
Safety first.
But you guys don't wear them.
I only see little kids wearing them.
You're just doing this to make fun of me.
No, I'm not. I swear.    You look hot in a helmet.
Need some help?
 Do you think?
Aww, check out Lynch.
What the hell?
Woah! Shit, man!    I was just trying to help!
Ryan, what the hell?
He had his hands all over you!
No he didn't. I can take care of myself!
I am so sorry about that. He can

Yeah, I'm fine.
Well, thank you for your help.    I am so, so sorry about that.
Joe.
 Shan!
Well it was nice to meet you.
 I was like one second away from beating that guy's ass.
I know you were, man.   Come on. Don't sweat it.
Seriously, that guy was such a dick.
Come on boys. We can talk about how tough you both are at the bottom.
I'm tough.
I know you are.
Are you kidding? We are totally doing this every weekend. In fact, if they were open during the week I'd say we should cut class, too.
Last one to the bottom is buying dinner!
We gotta take a weekend trip up
Done. When I stayed with my cousin out West two years ago it was like
Well, speaking of good skiing... it's been cool doing the bunny hill
Dude, you didn't have to stay with us. It's totally cool if you want to go off for a few.
No, it's fine. I'm just saying let's step it up a notch at some point. It's been cool watching Parker fall on her ass all day but I would like to actually ski at some point.
You know, I've probably had enough for today anyway. I can just stay in the lodge if you guys want to go-
-no, no, no that's not what I meant. I didn't mean it like that.
I told you I didn't have to come.
Parker, I didn't not want you to come.
It was his idea that we invited you in the first place.
Exactly. Remember? I was like "Hey man, why doesn't Parker come
-I was like, "OK that would be cool".
It's OK, you guys. The last thing a girl wants to do is intrude on "guy time". I won't be offended. I've got stuff I could do anyway.  Actually, can I have the key? I should check my messages.
No. No locker key. I can tell you right now that every message on there is going to be from your Mom giving you more aggravation about whatever the hell.
She does not.
Ready for this? Two nights ago we were watching a movie and her Mom
She wanted to know if we wanted to have chicken soup or vegetable soup with Christmas dinner. Christmas dinner! Four weeks away, and she had to now right then and there what kind of soup we'd prefer.
What did you say?   You said chicken.
I'm sorry if I ruined skiing for you today.
You didn't! You didn't at all! You missed the part before you walked over here when I was all like, "Dude, this has been so cool...you know...doing..."
 What?
Joe!
 Wait up.
Hey. I just wanted to apologize again.
Oh, no big deal. He's just lucky he didn't make me mad. You know, I just look half your boyfriend's size.
Ex. He's my ex-boyfriend. We're, you know, trying to still be friends and everything but as you can see, that's not really gonna work.
 No way.
A group of us all agreed to go skiing this weekend and well, whatever. It's a whole story and-
-I don't want to hold you up. But that was just really embarrassing. So I just wanted to say sorry. 
Where, here? Yeah, probably, yes.
Cool. Well, my roommate and I come like every Sunday, so maybe I'll see you.
OK.   See ya later.
Actually, you know what? Would it be cool if I got your number or
Yeah, sure.
Shit. Don't ski with my phone. It's in the locker with everyone else's stuff. Do you have a pen?
Don't ski with a pen.     Sorry.
Just shoot then. I've got a really good memory. I've only smoked pot like 500 times so I'm good.
You know it's a gateway drug right?
Kidding.
Whew.   You! That's so like you!
But we gave you a hundred bucks and we've only gotten like 4 runs!
It's not my decision, man.    They're closing early.
Why don't you write a letter?
 Remember "429".
What?
Just remember "429".  "5022". "5022." "5022."

Sorry.
Honestly, I'd slide you some more money but we gave you everything we have.
 Hey man, do you have a pen?
It's not about the money. They need to clear the mountain. We've got weather coming in. There's nothing I can do.
What if we promise to run straight
Wicked fast.
Fine. But hurry. DAN                              PARKER Thank you!                           Thank you so much!

Nope.

You're not gonna hear me complain.
Pendergraft wants you to stop by the office.   Something about next weekend's schedule.
I'm not working next weekend.
Oh, come on. It's my brother's bachelor party. I put in for it two months ago.
Go talk to the boss. He's getting ready to leave.
I'm the best man!  Shit.
Ready to shut down?
There's three more on their way down. Wait for them, then it's all set.
I'm not waiting til we get back to campus to eat. I'm starving.

No they didn't. They couldn't have. I'm sure they have a system or something. There's probably security cameras on us right now.
HEY ASSHOLES?! START THE CHAIR!!! WE'RE FREEZING UP HERE!!!
What if they don't start it again?
 Will you stop?!
What did you say to the guy?
Me?   Nothing!
Well, clearly you pissed him off enough to do this.
I didn't do anything!   He knows we're still up here.

If you want, you can stand on the chair and I can hold onto you.
No.     I can't.
Well, if anything's gonna get you over your fear of heights, it's this.
 No. I'm fine.
Alright.
Hey...hey Parker...
Parker wake up.
Shit, I thought you stopped breathing...
What's wrong?
Nothing.
How about you help me up again and we try and get out of here?
Yeah.
OK.   1...2...3-
I feel like I gained about 100 pounds overnight.
It was all that pizza talk.
I have no strength.
Damn it.
Maybe later.
What? Like I'm gonna feel better if I wait a little longer? I should have done it last night while I still had some strength.
There's more snow fall on the ground and it's all fresh. Maybe the jump won't be as bad now.
Even if it was a foot deeper- it
What do you want me to do?
Nothing.   Let's sit and do nothing.
AHHHH!
How come you never have a girlfriend?
How am I supposed to answer that?
I mean, you're a decent guy. Girls dig you. But you never stay in a relationship.
I had a serious girlfriend once.
High School doesn't count.
Who?
This girl Annie. I met her at orientation. We emailed all summer and when we started school, it was like we were already going out. I
She um... same favorite movie as me. E.T. It was like soul mates
So then... what happened?
Same old shit.  No. You know what happened? She liked another guy. This fucking fraternity douchebag named Dean who kept sending her flowers and stuff. I don't know who it was exactly, but every time I'd go to her room some guy named "Dean" had left her notes and shit.
Why did she keep it? Was she trying to make you jealous?
I don't know. I think she just liked getting attention.
So she dumped you for a frat guy?
 So I turn around, and I'm like ready to kick the shit out of this guy. And all I see is a sea of fucking random people. Just all of these faces. This guy could see me and was making eyes with my
That's messed up.
I've never felt so stupid and bad in my life.  So I left.
You just walked out?
Yup. Told her to go laugh with "Dean the Frat guy". I was out.
That sucks.
Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to walk out. Maybe I needed to have a thicker skin and not be such a sensitive bitch, I don't know. Sometimes I think I was just insecure and maybe I
You should call her. When you get home. You could tell her that.
I can't.  She's dating Dean.
I should have done something.
There was nothing either of us could have done.
I sat here and let him die.
He was the one. He was the boy I was gonna marry.
Funny story. First grade, we all get left there for the day by our mom's. You know, alone in real school for the first time without our folks around. And Dan... Dan was this sort of chubby kid when he was little...
Nah, fuck it. He was a fat ass.
And all the mom's left and he just wouldn't let go of his mom's hand. He just stood there after she left, at the front of the room, crying
Sounds like Dan.
You have no idea. But then, the teacher... Mrs... What was her name? Mrs. Schifrin? She was trying everything to get the fat kid to stop crying. And so she
And so he had to sit with you?
For a week! For my whole first week of school I'm sharing my little cubby desk with his fat ass!
Douchebag.     I never let him forget it.
I loved him so much.
But if he died only for you and me to give up and die up here, that's bullshit.
Yes.
So I need you to pull it together, and we're gonna get out of this shit. We're gonna get out of this
Yes.
Help me up.
Are you OK? Do you have it?
Rrruh!
Oh my god!
Joe!    JOE!
Shit!    Hold on, just hold on!
 Please God...please God....please God...
Rrrugh!
You can do it. Please do it.
JOE!
 Got it.
Motherfucker.
I've got an audience.
The chair is gonna fall!
No.    No it's not.
You made it!
Not yet.   Halfway.
Please.
Parker. I want you to throw my extra pole as far as you can this way.
What?
I said THROW MY POLE AS FAR AS YOU CAN THIS WAY. When I get on the ground I'll need some defense.
Oh shit.
Sorry.
Stay perfectly still. I'm gonna get you home, OK?
Rrrrugh!
 Please god, don't let me fall. Don't let me fall.
Shit.
WHAT?
NOTHING.
WHAT'S WRONG?
NOTHING.    I'M GONNA GO FOR IT, OK?
 OK.
Yaaaaugh!
Rrrrugh!

LYNCH!? LYNCH!!!  ANSWER ME!!!

I'M GONNA GO GET HELP.       I'M GONNA GET RESCUE.
Hurry.   Please.

I'M GONNA GET YOU HELP!
Come on!     Try something, fucker!

ARGH!
 JOE!

OK.
Just don't move!     I'm getting help!
 Lynch.
AHHHH!
 Joe...?
Please.   Stop.
Hey!   Are you OK?!   Hello!
Lady.   Are you alright?
Hold on, hold on- we're gonna get you help...
 I don't know. I found her laying in the road alone. Looks like she was in some sort of accident. Right outside of Mount Holliston. I'm taking her to you now.
Hold on, Ma'am. The hospital is 10 minutes away. You're gonna be OK.
You're gonna be OK.
 You're gonna be OK, baby.
