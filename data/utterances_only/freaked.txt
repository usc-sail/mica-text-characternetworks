Can you imagine it, Regis, Kathie Lee? One day I'm a hot young movie star, and the next day I'm a hideous mutant freak, covered with festering lesions.
Sounds like my wife when she misses a mudpack!
Oh Regis! You're incorrigible! Ha- ha! (to Rick, she turns EARNEST) Ricky, once you were the all- American boy next door, star of the beloved Hey Dude films. Now the very mention of your name makes children scream in terror. We've all read about your disturbing story. But the people want to hear it from you, Ricky Coogan.  Won't you tell us your story?
Well, it's kinda long, but okay. It all started when I signed a deal to be spokesman for the E.E.S. conglomerate...
 So, what kind of crap do you scumbags want me to peddle?
Everything. Everything except shoes, of course. Hah hah...
Meaty Twig Beef Sticks.
Helmet Head hair spray.
Noxon 24 biogenetic neuro- fertilizer.
Fertilizer? Ricky Coogan does not do ads for hi-tech cow shit. I'm a star, got it, Hertz?  Rico, give these misguided clowns Tony Danza's phone number, and let's get the hell out of here.
Rick. Wait! Only you can stand up to the radicals trying to keep Noxon from the struggling farmers whose very future depends on it.
 Noxon? Wasn't that just banned?
Only in the U.S....and Europe.
But I heard that shit's lethal.
Rick, Rick, Rick... You want proof? Fine. Just take a seat. Please.
 Meet the head of our South American research facility, Juan Valdez.
My name is George Ramirez.
Whatever. He's worked with Noxon 24 every day for five years, and he's in fine shape. Aren't you, Juan?
Yes. I am fine. Me and my team in Santa Flan have--
Santa "Flan?" What kind of shitty name for a country is that?
It is named for the patron saint of creamy desserts... As I was saying, we've worked very closely with Noxon...
I personally supervised its development...
I performed rigorous scientific tests. No potential danger was left uninvestigated...
The environmentalists are crackpots, all of them.
It's ridiculous, I tell you. Totally ridiculous!
Thank you, Valdez. That will be all.
Wait a second--
Ricky, this is important. We're talking about a major threat to the EES image. How does 2 million dollars plus expenses sound?
Look, it sounds great, but--
I hear you. Make it five million--  that is, if the board agrees ...
Good, it's unanimous. Well, what do you say, Ricky? Are you EES's "Man in Santa Flan?"
My kids just loved you in "Hey Dude Three: The Final Countdown." We need more wholesome role models like you.
Uh-huh.  Where the fuck is Ernie?
Ladies! All I wanted was a manicure! Yah-ha-ha!  IT'S THE COOG!
IT'S THE ERNIE! WOOF! WOOF! WOOF!
 Mister Coogan, is this your bag?
Yeah, why?
Is this your kid?
Stuey Gluck!
Rick! Rick! Look! I got a rare still from your high school production of The Glass Menagerie! Could you sign it for me? Please?!
NO!  Let's get the hell out of here!
Rick! Wait up!
Rick! Remember the speech you gave at the Actors Forum for Social Justice!?
If all the world is a stage, then let us shine the spotlight on truth, integrity, and a deep compassion for all life.
Leave me alone, troll!  That was before I got an entertainment lawyer.
Quick, down here.
Rick! Rick! It says here Noxon's dangerous. Why are you lending your name to it? What's happened to you, Rick? You used to be good! And now... I just don't know...
Don't cry, Stuey, I'm still good.
ALRIGHT!
In the bag.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. To the right of the aircraft, you can see a great view of the Grand Canyon.
And to the left you can see a panic- stricken little troll.
AHHHHHHH!
You gonna eat your peanuts, Ernie?
Nah, you can have 'em.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH...
Hey, I'm okay!
OW!
Here we are Ernie, Santa Spam. World famous for loud music and hot sex!
It is?
Give me a few hours.
Sure glad that wasn't our plane.
EES mustn't stay! Take your toxic crap away! EES mustn't stay! 
Jesus! We better find the limo before these whale kissers chop us up and sell us for parts.  There it is.
Wait a second...
Let's go, Rick. They're waitin'.
Forget them. I got a better idea. If I can just find the right disguise...
Coog, those hippies'll tear us apart.
Hey, how'd you like to make a quick hundred bucks?
He says the pants don't usually come off for less than two-fifty, but since you're so cute, he'll make an exception.
Here.
Help! Ow! Give me back my crutches! You monster! Oh, the pain! The agony!
Are you okay? Let me help you!
Thanks. Don't worry about me. What's one man's pain weighed against the global injustice of corporate tyrants like EES? Go. The fight must continue.
Wow... My name's Julie.
Josh. Josh Tavner.
Mother Theresa. Glad to meet you.
Ow! Hey!
Give me those, ape. Help him up.
Hey Josh, a busload of us are headed over to Maracas to protest Noxon 24 and pelt Ricky Coogan with cow shit.
Same here! You could ride with us.
Us? You're with him?
Oh, he's okay. Have you ever heard of an idiot savant?
Sure.
That's Ernie. Except for the savant part.
 Ooooh, my pelvis.
 Is this better?
Hey Julie. You know I'm kind of an idea man myself. Like, let's say there's a nuclear war, and the only two people left are you and the Pope... Would you pork him?
But one thing's for sure. That Coogan guy sure is an asshole, huh?
I'll say! What a total piece of shit. Don't you think so, Josh?
 Well, he's got a few problems.
And what a lousy actor! I mean can you believe that "Hey Dude" crap?
Well, with a script that bad, Coogan deserves an Oscar for coming off as good as he did!  I mean, that's what I read.
Well, he's no Christian Slater.
 SLATER!? I could act circles around that one-note hack! He was shittin' his diapers when I was the toast of Broadway! I made grown men cry! I made crippled children laugh! Now all I ever hear is Slater! Slater! Slater! WELL SLATER CAN KISS MY ASS! YOU HEAR ME?
You think Slater could improv like this? Make you believe he was an invalid!? Huh!?
 So, do you like Swedish films?
You don't even want to hear the truth about Noxon, do you, Coogan?  JULIE I mean, look, I'm not saying this stuff is going to turn anyone into a... a...
 Human worm...
Right. A human worm. I mean, that's just stupid. The point is--
Dog boy...
Yeah, or a dog boy. That's absurd. BUT--
Hideous frog man.
Okay, okay. Now you're just being silly. Human suffering's just a big joke to you, huh? You are sick, Coogan!
Cool! A freak show! Let's check it out!
Kind of like a family reunion for you, huh?
Lighten up, Coog, could be a goof.
Isn't it great? It's so "real"...
Real stupid.  Let's go. This place is dead.
Yeah. Where are all the weirdos?
There are no weirdos here.
Mutants, yes. Genetic nightmares, definitely. Children of Hell and twisted masses of living, breathing tormented flesh, certainly. But as for weirdos... not a one. Unless of course you count me! Ha ha ha!
Nah, you seem like a regular dumbshit old redneck to me.
I'm Julie. And you are...
Elijah C. Skuggs, proud proprietor of Skugg's Fabulous Freak Land and Mutant Emporium. But you knew that. After all, you've ventured miles away from civilization, hospitals, telephones,  police... How may I help-you?
Drop dead.
We'd like to see your freak show. You see, only by appreciating the variety and innovation of nature can we come to respect the fragile complexity of our global eco- system.
And you come to me looking for weirdos?
Hey! What the--
 Eeuuuwww... (composes herself and WAVES) Ahem. Hello.
Mr. Toad is my... assistant. As for the show, I'm afraid the next parade of deformity isn't until tomorrow night...
Oh, just our luck...
However! I do have a private exhibit in my shed you might enjoy. I don't usually share it with the general public...
We're deeply honored. But no thanks.
Yeah. We really must be--
The sideshow tradition has been misrepresented by the media. You don't traffic in human misery. You show society the part of itself it doesn't want to look at.
Yes... Yesm I see...
What the heck. We'll see some pickled dog brains, maybe some pictures of women with, you know, added equipment.
And to think we could be in the limo with those stewardesses.
What the hell, Coog, these people are weird, but they seem nice enough.
AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! HE-HE-HE! HA- HAHA! HE-HO-HE-HE-HA-HA! AH-HA-HA- HEHA! YAH-HA-HA-HA-HEE-HEE-HO-HA- HE-HE!
HA-HE-HE-HE! God I love the Family Circus! How do they do it day after day? It's amazing.
 ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!?
Well, I guess they do use the same joke over and over. I'm just a sucker for that little moffet's shenanigans, that's all. (he tosses the funnies ASIDE) But perhaps I should tell you a little more about what I do. You see, I not only exhibit freaks, I make them. Just like Michelangelo saw the angel in the stone, I look at a guy like Kevin Costner and see a giant peach grub who can fart the Blue Danube! (mops brow, asks OFFHANDEDLY) Am I crazy or is it hot in here?
Behold! The Tasty Freekz machine!
My God! He's using Noxon Twenty- Four!
Hey! You're not supposed to have that stuff!
Oh? Well, I guess I'm not supposed to have these either!
I need only punch a few buttons on this magnificent device, and it gives me an easy-to-apply ointment that will mutate a perfect young body, bubble its skin, warp its bones and twist its guts into AN UNSPEAKABLY REPULSIVE, STOMACH- TURNING FREAK OF MY OWN DESIGN!
Wait a minute. Does this mean we're not going to see a show?
 Toad, fire up that machine, and let's turn these hapless asswipes into monstrosities!
Now let's see. Who wants to get freaked first?
 Ladies first!
Go screw yourself!
If I were you, I would!
Hmmmm.
 It's like Yin and Yang... AC/DC... two birds with one stone... Yeah, it's pretty darn good, really...
Let 'er rip, Toad!
Wait a second. You're really gonna smear that stuff on us and mutate our body parts!?
Correct.
Well... then could you give me a really big rodney?
I'm a mad scientist pal, not a miracle worker.
Oh God!... No!... Holy shit! 
Gumby! Put that thing away!
Feast your eyes!
NOOOOO!
Well, at least I'll never have to go far for a piece of tail.
Pig!
Ouch! I was just trying to keep things light. Oh God! Why me!?
Mother always said there'd be days like this. And I thought she was nuts!
 A mere party trick. But you, you're gonna be special.
 Let me go, Skuggs, or else! 
 You know her?
Ah, screw it. I'd never get anywhere with her. TOAD! FIRE UP THAT INFERNAL YOGURT MACHINE!
For years I've strived to create the ultimate monster. The first of a whole new generation of superfreaks! Now I've finally got you, the perfect subject--a real asshole! HA-HA- (he pauses and looks closer at Rick) Wait a minute. Aren't you the guy from "Hey Dude Three-The Beguiling?"
Yeah, that's me!
You were great in that picture! Oh well, I guess for the next one they'll have to get Christian Slater! HA-HA-HA!
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRGGGGGGG!
This is Red Swan. May I speak to the Laughing Man?... Yes, I'll hold.
Laughing Man? Red Swan. I've done it! I found the perfect subject-- huge ego, shallow personality, almost no moral values... A lawyer? No, better. An actor. Yeah, the guy from those hilarious "Hey Dude" movies! Hahahaha--
 Well, I liked 'em.
Right... Yes... Yes, I see... But that's just it. He's not quite, uh, finished. I need more Noxon so I can--
 Geez, what a grouch.
 Laughing Man? I have to go. What about the Noxon? Two days? Great, you can see everything then... Yeah, you take it easy too.
Wakey, wakey. Time to meet and greet the new you.
Huh?
AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
Oh God! This was my good side!
Still is if you ask me! Hell, even half-done, you'll be the star of the show tonight.
Welcome to your spacious accommodations.
 Great use of the space.
I learned it all from Bob Vila.
You know you could expose those rustic beams and put in a skylight over one weekend, Elijah.
Give it a rest, Bob!
One of these days I gotta put a shitter in there.
No problem. It's all here in my Beds and Bathrooms book, Elijah. And you pay nothing for thirt--
Ernie? Julie?
Over here, Coog.
Are you alright?
I know that voice. That's the voice that said,  "Cool, a freak show. Let's check it out!"
What!? Oh sure, blame the woman. Typical.
 "It's so real." Is this real enough for you? I'm friggin' Quasimodo!
Chill out, Coog. You're talking to the original tag team of ugly pukes. Step into the light.
Okay, here I come.
ULP!
Oh geez... It's not so revolting. After all, physical beauty is just a socially-enforced myth that we, uh, oh shit... ULPI
 Yeah, well, you're no Mona Lisas yourself. You're lucky I've got a strong stomach!
And you're lucky I don't BITE you! Heh heh heh heh ...
Get away from me you, you...
Freak? Ha ha hahahaha!  I am Juan the Dog Boy, leader of the freaks.
 Kind of the "top dog."
Welcome to Hell, Rick. Shake?
No thanks. I don't plan on staying long. How many of you are there in here anyway?
First, I have a question for you, Ricardo. Who starred in the film "International Velvet?"
Huh?
Well, perhaps we should ask the Worm!
Tell us, Worm, who starred in "International Velvet?"
Yes, yes ... very interesting... International Velvet... The perfectly appalling sequel to National Velvet, I believe. No dramatic verisimilitude whatsoever.
Yes, Worm. But who was the star?
Olivia DeHavilland.
Olivia DeHavilland... Rick, do you agree or disagree?
This is nuts. This is crazy... Besides, it was Tatum O'Neill.
Very good. It was Tatum O'Neill, now married to tennis star John McEnroe. Circle gets the square.
Yayyy!
Blast. O'Neill ... No talent ragamuffin...
okay, JulieErnie, your turn. Who's it going to be?
Nosey the Nose Man!
Cowboy!
The Bearded Lady!
 How ya' doin.
Sockhead!
The Human Torch!
Rosie the Pinhead!
The hideous Frog Man!
And of course, in the center square, Mr. Paul Lynde!
Well JulieErnie, who will it be?
Call me old-fashioned, but I'll go with Paul Lynde.
Don't be an idiot.
You see, Rick? Just because we're freaks doesn't mean we can't have some fun, huh?
Get away from me. Get away! I'm not like you. You hear me? I'm Ricky Coogan! I AM NOT A FREAK!
Okay Coog, so I get twenty four hour access to T `n' A, and you look like a plate of rancid giblets. We're still pals, right?
All the freaks have gone through this anguish, Rick. At first, I was blinded by my anger. I admit it. I wanted to break your neck for getting me into this. But I got over it. Juan taught me to channel my anger for the common good.
It was your fault, anyway. You wanted to see the freak show.
 I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP!
Ernie!
Oh... Sorry, Coog. For a second there, I was a total man-hater. Weird.
Here. Take it.
"So You're a Hideous Mutant Freak-- Now What?"
we're in cubicle eight. Maybe later you'll be ready to talk.
Forget it. Not me. I'm not like those other god-forsaken animals.
You're mistaken, Rick. You are exactly like us. We were all normal healthy folk before we made the fateful mistake of visiting this hell hole at an off hour. Why, when I first came here...
DISSOLVE TO:
I was a professor of lacrophylogy-- er, the study of worms, of course. I came in search of the Epsosophecci dilepsidae--in layman terms, the fat pudgy worm. Mr. Skuggs said he had just such a worm in his shed. How could I have surmised that the specimen and I would ultimately prove to be one and the same?
At first, the transformation was fabulous. I truly understood the worm's ethos like never before. But those early days of fascination are over. Now, in retrospect, I think the whole thing is a fucking headache. I'd sell my soul just to be able to wipe my own ass...
I first came here as a tourist, looking for some fun...
DISSOLVE TO:
Anyway, then Elijah turned me into a sock. That's it.
Sorry. I'm not much for stories.
When I arrived here, I was nothing like I am now.
DISSOLVE TO:
I was confused--a walking contradiction, so full of questions.
Now I know who I am. I can say, "Hey world. This is me. I'm a woman. And I like me."
DISSOLVE TO:
You are one of us now, Rick. Whether you admit it or not. It's irrefutable.
Yeah. Says you.
TO:
TO:
 You're right.
Hey. Mind your business.
Sorry.
Well that EES guy should rescue me any minute. Then it's straight to the plastic surgeon and back to sunny old L.A. I wonder how many of my beautiful, anatomically correct girlfriends will be waiting for me.
I'll be waiting for you, Rick!
Thanks, Stuey.
AHH! A phantom troll!
 Seeing phantom trolls, Rick?
 No.
Sounds to me like you've developed a telepathic bond. Don't mean yer nuts or nuthin'. Heck, old Nosey, why he can smell the future. Lots of us freaks got E.S.P. And Sockhead, he's got E.S.P.N.
Watch out, Hulk! He's gonna try the skull cracker!
Shucks, Rick, you're lucky. Telepathy like yours only occurs between real soulmates. A bond like that should be cherished.
Wow! I'm Ricky Coogan's soulmate!
In your dreams! Now get lost, troll!
 Wait'll I tell the kids at school!
Shucksm Rick, it don't make sense to spurn your soulmate. I reckon that troll could help you if you just let him into your heart.
Once America sees what happened to Ricky, they'll probably send the whole FBI down to save him!
I'll probably win a Pulitzer prize for this scoop. And I'll dedicate it to Rick!
Of course I'll print it! America needs to know! Burt! Give mister Gluck his fee and show him out.
That's okay. I know the way.
 "Freaky Deaky! Ricky Coogan's a mutant in South America! By Stuart S. Gluck."  That's me!
Heh heh heh heh hehh heh.
Sure I wrote the article. But--
Ha-ha-ha!
No. You've got it all wrong. I don't know anything about that. You gotta believe me.
Ho-ho-hahahaha hee hee hoohaaa!
Wow, what a great model!  But look, this one's crooked.
 Sorry.
Alright, freaks! Get ready for the glamour! Get ready for the glitz! Get ready to be pelted with rotten vegetables, 'cause it's showtime!
It's grisly! It's revolting! It'll make you wish you were dead! And at just twelve bucks a head, you can bring all the kids!
C'mon, my granny could throw better than you!
 Quiet, please.
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness a cavalcade of atrocities so horrific, I advise the more sensitive members of our audience to leave the premises.
Tonight I'm proud to announce the addition of several new monstrosities to the show, including our star attraction, the Beast Boy--an untamed and highly dangerous ghoul who's liable to go nuts and kill us all at the drop of a hat. (impressed "oohs", "ahhs", and "cools" from the AUDIENCE) But first up, prepare to behold an unspeakably repulsive yet heartwarming atrocity, Three Men and a Baby!
Arrrggg. I am Beast Boy. I will eat you. Arrrghh. (he throws down the SCRIPT) I can't do this shit!
Damn it! What's keeping those guys?
Something's troubling you, my boy. what is it?
Well, let's see. I've been kidnapped, hideously disfigured, imprisoned with a bunch of mutant freaks, my rescue party is M.I.A., and this dialogue makes "Hey Dude Three" read like "Dr. Zhivago."
I think I know what you're going through. I too had an eating disorder. You see, I've always had a feverish obsession with pudding. And when I was a young lad...
And now a perennial favorite here at Freakland, ladies and gentlemen. I know you'll all enjoy the musical stylings of Rosie the Pinhead.
 EEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIEEEEEE...
Hey Julie, how many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
How many?
Two. One to screw it in and one to ride my Rodney! Ha-ha-ha!
Oaf!
If your coloring is in the autumn range, like Maria's, try an earth tone eye makeup. Now I've done a lovely French braid on Maria, but I encourage everyone to experiment and use your imagination. The main thing is to just have fun with it.
Edelweiss, Edelweiss.
He's got a hand under there!
It's a hoax!
Puppetteering is an admirable skill in its own right! Give him his due!
Where's the beast boy you promised us!? Bring on the beast boy! We want the beast boy!
And when I won first prize, they never called me pudding-head again.
So?
Don't you see? You must turn your hardship into inspiration! You're an actor, Rick! Your body is your instrument, and with it you must play your tragic symphony for all the world!
 They're going nuts for you, Beast Boy! You better go out there now!
 I'll be right there.  Thank you Worm. I don't really know how I can repay you for this.
 You could wipe my ass.
 Ha-ha! Always the wit, eh Worm?
 Damn.  Nosey, have I ever told you what a gifted artist you are?
Now is the winter of our discontent, Made glorious summer by this son of York, But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks, Nor made to court an amorous looking glass, I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion, Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
 If you're having trouble understanding Mr. Coogan's brilliant reading of this soliloquy from Richard the Third, please take advantage of the handy subtitles for the culturally illiterate.
SHHH!
Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time, {I'M UGLY} Into this breathing world, scarse half made up, {I'M REALLY UGLY} And that so lamely and unfashionable, That dogs bark at me as I halt by them. {I'M F KIN' BUTT-UGLY, ALRIGHT!?} Why I, in this weak piping time of peace, {BLAH, BLAH, BLAH} Have no delight to pass away the time, {I NEVER GET LAID...} Unless to see my shadow in the sun, And descant on mine own deformity! {BECAUSE I'M UGLY}
I'm saved! Haha! You sorry mutants are gonna rot in this hole while I'm sipping mint juleps by the pool! {AS FORTUNE SMILES O'ER MY FATE, SO DESTINY SPURNS YOUR ACCURSE'D PATE}
 I mean, um, I hope you have room for all my friends, heh-heh.
Rick, Rick, listen, I really love this new look you've come up with. But just between you and me, I don't think the guys upstairs would really get it.
What are you saying!?
 I'm saying you're ugly enough to burn the nosehairs off a dead nun.
AH-HA-HA-HA! WHAT A PUTZ!
EAT SHIT!
Now you're just being childish.
AHHHHHH! HELP! LET US OUT OF HERE!
Now that's entertainment.
I'd like to buy a vowel.
Hey. The Wheel. Mind if I sit in?
So. Now you don't mind mixing with us--how did you say it--sorry mutants?
Look! I'm sorry for what happened at the show. Can't you just forget it?
Hey, shouldn't you tell Rick about your big escape plan?
Well, excuse me for living.
You have an escape plan?
Listen, Beast Boy, the games are a simple diversion.  JUAN Beneath our twisted flesh we freaks cry out for freedom! Aooooooorrraaaagh!
Aoo...
Juan's plan is really ingenious Rick. See, he figured out that--
I figured out that our escape does not include the Beast Boy. No one may discuss the plan with him, understand?
What's the matter with all of you? You trust your lives to a guy just 'cause he can lick his own privates?
You gotta admit, Coog, it's a helluva trick.
 Fine! I'll just come up with an escape plan of my own then.
Haha! I have spent a year studying this hellhole, devising the perfect escape. You think you'll just tango right out the door!? Ha! Just try it, amigo.
I will!
Rick, wait.
Yeah. Don't go off half-cocked. Believe me, it ain't all it's cracked up to be.
This isn't one of your dumb movies, Coogan. Look, Juan's a good dog, a smart dog. I'll talk to him. Don't be stupid, Rick. You can't do it without us.
Forget it! I don't need you, EES, or anybody else! I'll get out of here all by myself, you... you.,. crud sucking pus monkeys!
I'm getting a bad feeling here.
Damn.
 Psst! Hey, you. Milkman!
Yeah... ?
Just the man I'm lookinq for. Be a pal, and give me a hand will ya?
Oooh no! I know you freaks. You'll try anything just to get someone to open that door. Well not me! Ha!
Okay. Guess I'll just have to milk the world's biggest breasted woman all by myself. Sorry to bother you.
 Ooohh... Milk me! Milk me now! Milk me hard!  I've only got two hands, all right? Geez. I don't care if Elijah did give you skim milk on the right side, chocolate on the left, and eggnog in the middle.
 Gee, I love eggnog!
Hey, what the--
Shit.
Damn! This guy doesn't trust anybody!
AHHHH!
Good work, Eye and Eye.
 Now bring the Beast Boy to my, uh, den. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
 Diet soda?
No thanks.
Fiddle Faddle?  You sure?
Well, okay. (he scoops some into his MOUTH) Well, are you gonna torture me or kill me or something?
Torture my greatest creation ever!? Kill the final piece of the puzzle that I've been putting together for years!? Sure, it'd be fun, but I've got a bigger plan, my boy.  ELIJAH And when you ripped off that guy's head, I knew it was working like gangbusters!
But I thought I scared everyone away.
Uh-huh. And then they told two friends, and they told two friends, and so on, and so on. Look at this.
 Dear Mister Skuggs, I was shocked and disgusted when my grandson told me about the head-popping beast at your show. Please send me six tickets.  Dear Beast Boy, I used to like New Kids on The Block, but you're way cuter. My favorite ice cream is chocolate. Is it fun ripping people's heads off? I love you.  The Beast Boy is on a blood-letting spree, and Oscar is along for the ride!  That one's from Pat Collins!
Yeah, but she loves everything.
Toad! That Fiddle Faddle is for guests only! You've had enough!
Look Skuggs--Elijah--I've been in show business all my life. The public does not want to see disgusting, depraved violent filth.
Oh, and I suppose Jake and the Fatman is just a fluke?
I'll get it.
`Yello?
Yes... Right... Tomorrow... Mmhmm... Mnunhmm... Wow. Okay. You got it... Hasta la vista to you too. Hahaahahaahaha--
Okay, Coogan. I'm finished with you for now.
But listen. I may not be "Mr. Tinseltown", but I damn well know what I like. You're gonna be a hideous killing machine, and that's final! Tomorrow night I'll finish the job onstage! And then, to demonstrate your horrible power, you'll slaughter all the old obsolete freaks in cold bl--HEY!
AAAGGGGHH!
I told you enough!
Bye-bye. And remember, try another escape, and I'll feed your balls to Toad.
Hey Rick, I thought you were gonna come up with your own escape plan?
 This is your big plan? A dozen milkmen? Isn't that a little unusual?
Twelve milkmen is theoretically possible. Thirteen is silly. Looks like one milkman too many, Coogan.
Fine then. Go ahead. Hope you like reggae, ya flea bitten bastard.
Ah, shit.
Look, you'll all be killed. You don't know about Elijah's giant Rasta eyeballs with machine guns...  It's suicide! I can't let you do it.
And I can't let you stop us.
That's a lot of milkmen on the same route. No wonder they fight.
Squirrel!
Wow, giant Rasta eyeballs, just like Rick said.
Gosh, if it wasn't for Rick, we'd all be dead!
Yeah! Way to go Rick! Alright!
 God, I can't believe he left you for a squirrel. What a dick.
You know how men are. Besides, it was a pretty good looking squirrel.
 Come on. You heard the Beast Boy. Back to the Freak House, now.
Not again.  Oh well, at least we'll get to try a new position.
AHHHHH! STOP IT! OOOWWWWW!
Notice the way I use an elliptical motion to chafe Stuey's buttocks. (the Goons nod ATTENTIVELY) It's all here in my new book: Pipes, Fixtures, and Torturing TROLLS--
 A-HA-HA-HAHA-HA-HA-HA!
No way. I'll never talk! I'm made of stone!
HELP! RICK! RIIIIIIIIIICCKKK!
TO:
 Julie, compared to this, sex with Julia Roberts was a thankless chore.
BACK TO:
TO:
Oh Rick, you've touched a place in me no one has ever touched before.
I'll say! Almost punctured a kidney!
DISSOLVE TO:
Rick! Riiiicccck!
Rick! Do something! It's up to you, Rick! Pleeeeeeease!
Aha-hee-hee-ho-ho-har-har-har!
The Laughing Man!
 Holy shit!
It says it's strong enough for a man!
But it's made for a woman!
Hey Rick. What's up?
Read this. I grabbed it from Skuggs' office.
"Tape Donahue... Renew Subscription to Beaver World..." Eeuw!
 Beaver World!?
 After that.
"Prepare demonstration for Laughing Man, receive five thousand barrels of Noxon." Five thousand barrels!?
Elijah's up to something big, and we have to stop him.
Mmmm. Jasmine.
Alright guys, listen up--
We're done for! We're done for! I don't want to die! It's the end of the world! The apocalypse! Aahh!
I haven't said anything yet.
Sorry. I'm not much for timing.
 Tomorrow night, at the show, I'll be turned into a homicidal monster and forced to kill you all. But we might have a chance if we act fast. And I'm prepared to be your new leader.
 I say we kill him.
And I've got a plan.
I still say we kill him.
If we can get into Elijah's lab, maybe we can--
Of course! Design a super freak of our own and manipulate the genetic code to make him destroy Elijah instead of us! Brilliant!
Oh. Well--
But how do we get to the lab?
Um, maybe--
Right! The worm could dig a tunnel!
By God, it's so crazy it might just work!
But you need Noxon 24 to make the freaking sludge, and Elijah told us himself he's run out of it.
Oh. Oh yeah. Well, see, what I was going to say was--
Yes! Exactly! If they've been using Noxon 24 as a fertilizer here, the entire ecosystem must be soaked with it! All we need is a way to extract it from the vegetation, ideally into a liquid form.
Right. Well, what about--
Golly! So that's why my milk comes out that funny green color! I thought the grass tasted funny! Wow, Rick, you're a genius!
 Good thinking, Rick.
Way to go, Rick! How did you ever think of such a plan?
Well, actually, I was going to suggest we send away for sea monkeys, train them to fire guns, and make a break for it. But if you want to go with this other thing, I guess that's okay.
WOULD YOU TURN DOWN THAT GODDAMN RACKET!?
SOR-RY.  What a jerk!
Hey, look at this!
Good Lord! It's the Lost City of Nodd!
Wow!
It's Old Faithful! (foriegn take: "It's the Blarney Stone!"]
It's my Aunt Gladys!
And that's me at my bar mitzvah!
C'mon Ernie, let's go.
Wait, you gotta see the ones from sleep-away camp! They're hilarious!
Stooge!
Almost there.  But wait, I'm getting a whiff of things to come!
What do you smell?
 Blood.
 And hot buttered popcorn!
Awwright!
I hate when you do that.
Hey! Do you hear that?
It's a dog!
 Hurry!
Scrappy!
It's been ten years since you chased this ball into the sewer! I thought you were gone for good!
Yap!
Listen Scrap. Go home. Get help. Understand?
Yap!
Good boy! Now go!
You never know.
Look, a wood floor.
It must be the lab! we've done it!
Not so fast, you scabrous freaks!
Didn't know I did impressions, did ya?
Mission accomplished. They've got the Noxon, and they'll be in the lab within minutes.
Boy, this is going like clockwork!
No! Can't you see we're digging our own graves!? 
 OUT OF MY WAY!
 I... I... just... wanna...say...
What is it, kid?
Ah, forget it. I'm not much for dying.
Shit. I can't see a damn thing.
Keep your voice down, Ernie.
Don't push me, Coog. I got a real short fuse today. I'm cranky, bloated, got a wicked case of cramps. Don't ask why.
 PMS...
 Oh.... Right.
Good work, my boy. Now step aside. This is scientist's work.
Hey! It's working!
You did it, Worm! Way to go!
But how? You didn't even use the Noxon.
Ah! You don't need Noxon to make Butterscotch pudding. I just wanted to test the machine's capabilities. Mmmm! Glorious! So creamy! Yum!
Hang on, Rick. Do you really think we should put this toxic glop on you? What if it doesn't work? What if something goes wrong? What IF--
If it does work, do you think there'll be enough left over to give me a monster size rodney?
 Here, hold this.
 Thanks.  Look, I've been a freak all my life.' I realize that now. Up there on that screen, humiliating myself for every fool with six bucks in his pocket--
Seven bucks.
Sometimes seven fifty.
Alright. It doesn't matter.
Sure it does. They don't let you into the theater if you don't pay the price of the ticket.
Look, I'm talking about the ultimate human sacrifice.
No kidding. When you consider money for parking, popcorn, drinks...
Don't forget a sitter for the children!
Hey! In case you haven't noticed, I'm about to commit a noble and selfless act here.
Oops.  Okay. Let's do what we came to do, and this time, no more screw ups.
Styrofoam cup?
Don't you think we should make some more pudding first, as a test?
No. Here goes.
Somebody's comin'! Hurry.
We have to wait. There's no way to speed up the machine.
Here it comes.
It's plugged up!
 If it's your damn pudding, I'll ring your wormy neck.
 Preposterous... I have no neck. I'm a worm, imbecile.
Aaargh! Damn buttered popcorn!
The tunnel walls are about to collapse!
You go ahead. I'll catch up.
BUT--
Go!
Rick! Come on!
Bad for the environment.
Just made it!
Paul saved our lives!
Way to go, Paul!
I... buried... Paul.
This is no time to lament over a cadaver! We've got to get moving, or we're history! Now c'mon!
Daed si luap.
I said enough! Okay, listen up, everybody. We cracked the code and made the ointment we need to bring Skuggs down for good.
But we left it in the lab.
But wait! I found some macaroons! And there's plenty for all of us!
Yaayyy!
TO:
 I don't believe it. What's Hertz doin' here?
So EES is in bed with Elijah C. Skuggs, eh? Figures.
Rick! Thank God I got to you in time!
Cut the crap, Hertz.
Ricky, you have no idea how your misfortune has touched our hearts. When you disappeared we almost gave up hope. But we'd heard reports of Skuggs's reckless abuse of Noxon, and when the story broke in the tabloids, I decided to personally come down and get to the bottom of things.
 Really?
No.  AHA HA HEE HEE HO HO HA HA HEE HEE HO HO HO HA HA HA HA!
Peuw! Hey! Of all the... That really pisses me off!
AAARRGGGGHH!
Holy shit.
Nice to see you in the flesh, Laughing Man.
No need to use codenames, Elijah. We're all friends here. And just to prove it, I brought you a little present.
Rick? Is that you?
Who's the troll?
He was asking questions about Coogan, causing trouble. We figured he was one of yours.
I make freaks alright, but come on, fellas--this thing's pathetic.
Well you're no Julio Iglesias yourself, mister.  Rick! Riiiick! Riii--
--iiiiiick!
Oh no, not now, Stuey!
 Hey. That's Elijah's lab!  Stuey! Are you really in the lab?
Yes! I'm in the lab! I'm in the lab!
Not only ugly, he's crazy too.
So, where were we?
Gentlemen, I'm not going to bullshit you. I know my setup here at Freakland looks like small potatoes.
But thanks to your Noxon and my genius, tonight I will turn Ricky Coogan into a freak so hideous, it'll be enough to turn your stomach inside out, boil your brain in its own juice, and cause cold sores you thought had healed up to start buggin' you again. (the EES men shift UNCOMFORTABLY) It's the dawning of a new age for us all. Behold, Super Mega Freak World!
It's really somethin', huh?
 Very impressive.
We'll kick Disney's dead ass!
Stuey! Stuey, can you hear me?
Mmm hmmm!
I want you to try and escape. Get the cup from underneath the instrument table and bring it to me, okay?
 Mmmm mmmmm!
Yeah, right. Get movin'.
At EES, our plans for your Gene Machine include everything, except shoes that is. Ha-ha-ha.
Ha-ha. Gee, I'd love to see your plans.
We'd love to show you.  Bill, if you'd be so kind.
What does today's businessman want? How about a receptionist with six arms, five mouths, and a knockout figure? That'd sure speed things up, wouldn't it?
In the factory, how 'bout a worker with twelve busy hands, no mouth to talk back, and no genitalia or digestive system to distract him from his work?  Sure! It's what we all dream of!
Well, with this Skuggs-based Noxon technology, it's not only possible, it's just the beginning! Of course, what happened to our expensive spokesman Ricky Coogan was an unfortunate coincidence, but profits from these new markets could total in the billions.
Ricky who?
Hey! Hold on!
Secretaries? Worker drones? Where's the fun? Where's the spark? Where's the unspeakable evil?
Ha-ha. I was just getting to that.
We'll impact every field. COSMETICS--BREAST ENLARGEMENT creams, nosejobs in a bottle. Military--human death machines that make Schwarzenegger look like a pansy! And why stop at consumer products? Hell, we can design a whole new consumer! A few well placed drops in the water supply, and bingo! It's a new master race, and we own the copyright! An entire planet of freaks owned and operated by us! Every part of their bodies comes from an EES supplier, every thought they think is EES policy! From now on gentlemen, it's EES uber alles! EES uber alles!
This guy's good.
We lured him away from A.T.&T.
Look! The troll!
After him!
Mmm! Mmmmm!
Take the tape off your mouth, idiot! They didn't tie your hands!
I got the cup, Rick!
Great! There's no time to waste. Are you being followed?
Yeah. But if I don't move, they won't see me.
Riiiick!
What a geek.
Stuey got caught. There's no way to get the ointment before the show.
So, that's it then? We're all to die... And by your hand no less.
No. It won't be me. It's some inhuman monster Elijah used me to create. As for me, the real me, I'll always be your friend. Before I have to rip your heads off, I'd like to say goodbye to each of you.  Worm... I'll miss your brains, the smell of your pipe, and the funny way you always go on talking until everyone wants to strangle you.
Hi, Rick.
Cowboy, I'll miss your good humor, your down-home wisdom, and of course, the frothy milkshakes were udderly delicious, heh-heh...
Bearded... Lady... I dunno. We'll always have Paris...
Nosey, I never really liked you.
Frog Man, I think death is probably the best thing for you now.
Ernie... Julie... I have mixed feelings.  On one hand, I'll remember you as the best friend a jerk like me ever had, and a low down repulsive slimeball.
On the other hand, I really respect you, and more than that, I, uh, well, I wish we'd had the chance to boink.
Oh, Rick...
Today I make the proudest boast a man can utter: "Ich bien ein Freak!"
Uh, I'm a freak.
And now the moment you've all been waiting for. Ladies and gentlemen, meet the lucky young man who's about to be become the monster with the mostest! Here he is, the Beast Boy!
AAHHHH! WE'RE IN A ZOO!
Rick! Over here!
With this remarkable ointment of my own design, I will now turn this half-finished ghoul into the ultimate super freak, dedicated to evil!
Stuey! Where are you?!
Here I am, Rick!
 Goddammit, kid! Would you sit down!?
AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Oh no!
What the hell!?
YOUR ASS IS MINE, SKUGGS!
Uh-oh, that kid looks pissed. EYE AND EYE! KILL HIM!
TOAD!
Looks like it's time to roll out the big gun.  Sayonara, kiddo. Any last words?
Nahh.
Suit yourself.
Wait! Wait! (Elijah pauses. Rick RECONSIDERS) Nahh.
AHHHHRRRGGG!
What a waste of twelve bucks. Let's get the machine and go.
TIME TO DIE, TROLL!
Rick! Rick! Could you sign this!?
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
Give him the skull cracker, ya big goon!
No way! The skull cracker is an illegal move!
Let's get this over with. Hey Hertz, tell your goons to (he turns to Hertz and is STUNNED) What the hell-!?
 Ahem. At this point in time we at EES regret that we must leave this performance prematurely.
What are you saying!?
What we're saying is... get stuffed, yokel.
I figured I couldn't trust you corporate greaseballs!
Let me proudly introduce the latest in our product line, Noxon 25--now available in a convenient pump!
Bullshit! The Everything Except Shoes corporation releases no new products unless I give the order!
I think it's time EES branched out a little.
Ahhh! Head for the hills before he gets all of us!
NOW I RIP FREAKS TO PIECES!
No! We're your friends!
Oh. NOW I RIP FRIENDS TO PIECES!
Now that's a really, really big shoe. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Hmmm, I think I'd like a pair of those!
 Would you hurry up and waste the troll, please!? I got a lonely shoe over here!
And then...
Sorry to interrupt Rick, but you've been talking for almost ninety minutes, and we've just got to go to a commercial.
Sorry.
We'll be right back after this, folks.
And now back to the exciting conclusion of Ricky Coogan's incredible story.
Well, let's see, the other freaks were lined up in Elijah's sights, and I was about to shove a pipe through Stuey's skull, when all of a sudden, I heard a voice...
Kill him! Kill him!
I reckon that troll could help you if you just let him into your heart... your heart... your heart...
Your heart... your heart... your heart...
Atta' boy Coog!  Hey, ain't that somethin'?
Tosh.  Sentimental claptrap Shameless, maudlin--Baaa!
Cut the lovey-dovey bullshit, and start mutilating each other!
Raarrrrrrgh!
You think I made you strong? HA! I've cranked my DNA up so high, you won't know what hit you. I'm a wrecking machine! Aaaaaaa!
 Ow! I think you crushed my spinal cord. I can't feel anything in my fingers.
Maybe you'll feel this ...
Qait--if you kill me, you'll never find the antidote.
What antidote?
A time release serum--I baked it into a delicious batch of macaroons.
If you ask me, you skimped on the coconut!
Come on, Coogan! Come oooon! You haven't got the guts to kill me! Go on! I dare ya'!
Yap! Yap!
Scrappy!
AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!
Yap!
Atta boy, Scrap!
Freeze, FBI!
Nice work, Ricky. You'll get a medal from the Vice President for this.
Great. But how did you--
We've been following Skuggs for years. Scrappy just filled in some of the details.
Yap!
Thank heavens you brought him to justice, Rick. God only knows how far his sick plans would've gone.
Is nothing sacred?
Oh, my Lord!
No! It can't be!
Thought you killed me, huh?
What the hell are you looking at?
Two pieces of deadmeat!
And that's my story.
 It was so exciting!
And long! My God! It makes War and Peace sound like a warm up act!
Okay! We got light!
It's fixed? Well, it's about time!
That's better.
I'll say.  How 'bout it, folks. Let's hear it for Ricky Coogan!
Can we bring out the other freaks now?
Ridiculous... Just because a man doesn't like macaroons... Nonsense.
Gotcha! Damn, it's about time!
Hey guys! Jeez! You look great!
That's just great. What a story. And what an ending! Elijah transformed by the goop!
And he really looked like--?
Exactly like you two, I swear. Same faces, same outfits, except they had these really big, hideous feet...
Show's over, Ricky!
I'm gonna drink your blood!
Rick! It's finally over!
Yes... Yes it is.
Rick! Rick!
Stuey!
Look! I found the real Regis and Kathie Lee!
No, this is just my lunch!
 This is Regis and Kathie Lee.
Awwww!
Oh, like that wasn't totally predictable.
Well, now it really is over.
Thank God. You know, this adventure has taught me something.  RICK When man starts impinging on the subtle perfection of the earth's natural order, the only thing he'll create is havoc.
Right, Coog. I learned somethin' too. That men and women truly are equals. That the human spirit transcends gender and physical appearance, and thus it is immune to the petty degradations men may devise. I believe it was Moliere WHO SAID--
Oh, shut up.  Let's go fuck.
Good night, everybody!
