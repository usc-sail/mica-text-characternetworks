...those assurances... by eleven o'clock... a state of war... that this country... at war with Germany.
 Flat foot floogie with a Floy Floy.
Stop that, Sue!
She just sings it. She doesn't know what it means.
Where are my stockings? I can't find my stockings!
Dawn, darling. They've started a war again.
 We mustn't frighten the little ones.
I don't care! I want my stockings!
Stockings? War! Don't you understand! War!
I don't care!
War! War!
Clive. Don't. Dawn, please.
German planes! German planes!
I did see them. I did.
He's the worst liar.
These are the fruits of my loins?
Is it peace in out time?
 No, Mother! It's War! War!
Or what?
War! War! War!
The others simmer down and shuffle into stiff and still poses. GRANDMOTHER, who perhaps cannot hear the Anthem, is baffled, shakes her head.
That's the all-clear. Testing. They were just testing.
Such a beautiful day too.
 Flat Foot Floogie with a Floy Floy.
Going to put a rockery garden over it, Mac.
Dad. It's full of water again.
Crocodiles! Aah!
The sodding water table.
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
 Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
My aunt in Australia has offered..
Snap it up. Great chance for them. Lot more future out there.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
I know you mean well.
There you go again. You're so bloody nice. I want to shake you.
Nothing will ever be the same again, Molly. And the funny thing is, I'm glad.
Now you're talking.
There's a soldier at he door, looking for you.
You're the biggest fibber.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
If there's no solider, I'll have you instead.
Cry baby Bunting.
Few bombs might wake up this country.
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Just ignore her, Mac.
There are many ways of saluting..  ..An old soldier insulting a young subaltern.
As an officer, you counter that with one of these.
Here is the news and this is Alvar Lidell reading it.
Come on. Come on.
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
It was the best time of his life.
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
And Jim.
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
I rode into battle...
...On horseback, with a drawn sword, leading a battalion of Gurkhas against the Turks.
I can't hear you.
And where were the Turks?
No Turks.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
They'd gone.
Saw Clive coming.
We all had to write a last letter home.
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
It's not like when you're in it. Just young boys spilling their guts in the mud.
What were they like, the Germans, when you were a prisoner of war?
Most of them were very decent to me.
I wish you wouldn't go saying that. You'll get into trouble.
You can speak German, can't you?
A bit.
Say something. I want to know what it sounds like.
Certainly not!
In den ganzen Welt die meisten Leute sind dumm.
Not so loud!
Dad, the News. It's the News.
Go off and play, son.
But Dad, It's the News.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
 The Germans! They've landed!
Only joking.
Bloody gin. Always makes me cry.
Got some wires crossed. Only weeps when she's happy.
You're making me start now.
Now, now Grace.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Kiss me Hardy.
Why couldn't I have the kids? Is he sitting up there... saying... "Grace, yes; Molly, no?"
Better off, Molly. What's to become of the poor mites!
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
 I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past. Made my hair stand on end. I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
Go the Hell.
Do you know what time it is? Go back to bed, this instant.
We're not going to be like them when we grow up. We're not even like them now.
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
You wouldn't.
Would.
You couldn't.
Could.
Sorry, kids. Joined up. I needed some Dutch courage to tell your mother.
Never say die!
Steady the Buffs.
Up the Arsenal!
He's one of the best.
Daddy you shut his hand in the door.
The silly bugger.
You silly bugger. We're trying to win a war and you start off by shutting your fingers in the bloody car door.
That's it for the duration. (runs a duster over the bodywork) I shall miss the old girl. Pop in and give her a polish, Billy boy. Just now and then. A car needs to be cherished.
Has Sue got it right?
What's that?
You joined up.
Oh, that.
I wish you could have told me yourself. (he takes Grace in his arms.) Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say it'll be over by Christmas.
Don't be so daft. Act your age.  I can't cope on my own. I'd better let the children go.
Billy boy. Before I go, there's something I want to tell you. You're old enough now. It's time. (produces a cricket ball from his pocket.) The Googly. Your hand is too small to master it, but not to start practising. Anyway, I'm going to pass on the secret now, father to son, in case anything happens to me.  You know the off-break, right?
And the leg-break?
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
It's like telling fibs.
That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
Dad! Dad!
Dad!
You survived that. The war should be no problem.
Time to go.
Australia?
Say goodbye and pass them through.
I'm going to miss the war and it's all your fault.
I can't do it. What's the point?
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Let me through, I want my children.
No one goes in there. You signed the forms, didn't you?
Yes, I did. And now I want them back.
Too late. Plenty of others would've been glad of their places.
Let me alone. I want to go. I want to go.
In front of everybody. They were all looking at us. Why did you have to do it?
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
Grace!
Changed your mind?
Yes.
Well, you're too late. Apply again. On your head be it.
Slow, quick, quick, slow. Right forward.. left together.. Three, four.. Back together.. Turn.. One, two.. Quick, quick, slow.
You know it? It must be an old one.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
After this dance.
I've got to move the Germans to Minsk. They've taken Minsk.
Tomorrow. Give them one more night of freedom. Move them in the morning.
Quick! Lord Haw-Haw! He's starting.
..the soldiers like to wager among themselves, what day will the German army enter Moscow? One thing is certain: much sooner than anyone thought. From here in Berlin, listeners in Britain, I can give some very definite news. There will be a bomber raid on London tonight, the fourteenth night in succession. Look out for bombs if you live in Carshalton or Croydon. There will be incendiary attacks if you live in Fulham and Hammersmith. And watch out in Kew; be alert in Walthamstow.
That's us.
It's just German Propaganda.
He always knows.
Half the time he's bluffing.
Bill, off to bed.
We better go to the shelter.
It's freezing out.
What would we do if a German came into the house?
Don't be silly, Dawn.
Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
Flak!
Basket bombing Counts between the bombs Two and three and four and five and six and..
Why didn't I take you to the shelter?
...four and five and six and...
If only I'd let you go to Australia.
...and five and six and...
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
...and four and five...
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
...and six...
I'm not going to die like a rat in a trap. Let me out of here.
I'm going outside.
Wait. Don't.
Quick, quick.. slow, quick, slow.
It's lovely. Lovely. Does little Billy want to see the fireworks?
Shrapnel! And it's still hot.
Come in at once, or I wash my hands of you.
Oh fuck... oh fuck... oh fuck...
Dressing from the right!
Late! My study before prayers.
Eyes front! Keep still down there, you little ones. It's discipline that wins wars.
Now quick march. Left... right... left... right. Swing those arms.
Oh God, bring destruction to our enemies. Make these young one's true soldiers of the Lord. Guide Mr. Churchill's hand in the cunning war.
Let our righteous shells smite down the Messerschmitts and the Fokkers.
Lord, send troublesome dreams to Herr Hitler. Let him not sleep the sleep of the innocent. And comfort our warriors at the fronts. Brighten their swords, burnish their bullets with your fire.
We beseech Thee, Oh Lord, to have mercy on these Thy children.
We dedicate our studies this day to the war effort.
Pink... pink... pink... pink... What are the pink bits, Rohan?
They're ours, Miss.
Yes, the British Empire.
Harper, what fraction of the earth's surface is British?
Don't know, Miss.
Anyone?
Two-fifths, Miss.
Yes. Two-fifths. Ours. And that's what the war is all about. Men are fighting and dying to save the pink bits for you ungrateful little twerps.
Books away! Scramble!
Gasmasks on!
Slowly... in... out...don't panic... in... out...
In... out... These masks are given to us to filter away abominations of the enemy.
Now, nine times table. One times nine is nine...
Two times nine is eighteen...
Can't we just see the end?
They've got the real thing outside.
It's not the same.
England is so beautiful, and he had to land here of all places.
Now then. Now then.
It's crooked. Rub that bit out and do it again.
Well, keep going. Don't stop now.
Nobody is going to see this far up.
Don't be so sure.
When I jitterbug.
It was great for me, how was it for you.
A bit too quick.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
They might be.
I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass.
Quit it. Help me someone. The girl's beating on me.
 Mind that shrapnel
 I'm starting my own collection.
 It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
Bill, Sue. Air-raid!
Dawn, what have you been up to?
I'm not going to that shelter. I'd sooner die.
Dawn! Come down here!
Please, God. Take me, but spare them.
You don't care if I die. How could you leave me there? Even if you don't love me?
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
The ideas you get in your head.
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
Pauline's mum got killed.
No, she didn't.
Yes, she did, didn't she?
Yes, she did. Killed stone dead.
You can ask her. Ask Pauline.
Isn't that right? You're mum got killed last night?
There you are. I told you.
Do you feel rotten, Pauline?
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Ask her yourself.
You do it. You're a girl.
Pauline.
Pauline. Do you want some shrapnel?
Do you want to play?
Hey, Terry. Pauline's mum got killed last night.
She never.
She did too.
Pauline's mummy got deaded.
You're lucky up here. The East End's been burning for three nights. Incendiaries.
Still not been hit, Mrs. Evans?
Touch wood.
You had a near-miss the other might.
I hear they're dropping diseased rats on bomb sites.
BILL found this tiny little parachute. So that's what it was for.
Is the piano all right, Grace? It was knocked clean over.
It seems to have survived.
Play something, Grace.
We never used to sing much before the war, did we? Not in daytime anyway.
Dawn's come on fast.
That's the war for you. Quick, quick, quick.
Didn't I see you with a soldier, Dawn?
I'm just doing my bit for the war effort.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
Try and few bars of old Fred, Grace.
 Tell them about Pauline's mum.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
Looking for shrapnel.
What you got?
Look, a detonator.
Unexploded.
You were spying.
I never was.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
I know a secret.
What's that?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Who told you that?
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
They're not.
If you find them hiding, they cut your throat. They have to, or they'd get found out.
I wish one would come through the door now.
You want to join our gang?
I don't mind.
Do you know any swear words?
Yes.
Say them.
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
I only know one.
Well say that one then.
Fuck!
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
Bugger off.
Sod.
Sod.
Bloody.
Bloody.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
OK. You're in.
Let's smash things up.
This is top secret.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
Won't they have maps?
They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.
 Ven der Fuhrer says Vis iss der master race, Ve vart, vart, vart, Right in der Fuhrer's face.
And where do you think you're going?
Out.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
No, I won't.
You wouldn't dare defy me if your father was here.
If you've finished, I'm going.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
There, there, my baby.
Go if you want. What does it matter? We might be all dead tomorrow.
I can't go like this.
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
Who said anything about love?
Want to see our den?
We got a bed.
Go on, Pauline. Be a sport.
No, I won't. There's too many of you.
One at a time.
No, I won't.
I'll give you something.
All right. Line up.
I seen better.
It won't bite you.
Pack it in. It's time to smash things up.
 Fuck!
Teach him a lesson. Think they can come over here and take our women.
Wasn't that your sister, Rohan?
You need suspenders for this kind.
I'm going to cross my legs and make that rustling noise.
Steak! I can't remember the last time...
crooning ironically
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
Sorry, sorry. Too long in the barrack room.
If the British Empire lasts for a thousand years, men will say, this was their finest hour.
Oh, do let's listen to this. I never tire of listening to it. I gives me goose pimples.
You haven't been taking your orange juice.
Don't sound the Dunkirk I was at. I saw no fighting. We did a lot of running backwards, though. Then we got to the beach and we couldn't run no more. And Jerry just sat there and let us alone. If he'd come after us, boy
How can you say such things? Can't you hear what happened?
I was there.
God laid his hand upon the waters and they were still. The armada of little boats brought their precious cargo into safe havens. They lived to fight another day.
He who turns and runs away lives to fight another day.
I don't care what you say. It filled our hearts that day. The little people stood up for once against the tyrant. Stood up and said no!
That's how we put up with the bombing and the rationing, because of Dunkirk. Because of the spirit of Dunkirk, and because of that we shall never give in, never.
On the bike for five hours. Only got a thirty-six hour pass.
Hand me my backpack, Bill.
And what's that?
Jam.
Jam? What kind of jam? It's not like any jam I know.
German jam. It's German jam.
It's all right. It came from a German chip. It got sunk, and this stuff washed ashore, crates of it. Jam. Our fellows found it on the beach, by the rifle range.
We don't know anything about it
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam. They could poison half the country.
Come away, children. I don't want you to stand too close while he's opening it.
Well?
It looks....foreign.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
That's not the point.
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
You taste it.
Give us some, Dad.
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
That's it.
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
What are you going to be then?
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
Poor Clive. You wanted it so much.
You're such a baby.
It's lovely jam. It's nearly as nice as English jam.
You know what I always say? Jam is jam, the world over.
Bruce, this is my father. Dad, this is Corporal Bruce Carey.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
We thought it was poison.
The poison was at the bottom.
When do you think you'll get leave again?
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Where to?
Woolamaloo.
Not Woolamaloo?
Woolamaloo? We would have lived in Woolamaloo?
 W-O-O-L-A-M-A-L-O-O, oo. Upon my word, it's true. It's the way to spell Woolamaloo.
 I bet you a dollar, There isn't a scholar, To spell it right first go, O, W-O-O-L-A-M-A-L-O-O, Loo-O
What kind of war is this Mac? Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
What about it?
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Why not?
You need trees for an avenue.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Propaganda. We've been had.
How's your war, Mac?
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
Except the servicemen.
Naturally.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
Look at how wild the boy's got. As for Dawn. Sixteen, going around with a soldier.  Keep and eye on them for me, Mac, there's a pal. I've made a mess of it all. (his voices cracks. A sob wells up.) I've been such a bloody fool.
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
Bugger the Buffs.
Take cover! We're being attacked by our own balloons!
It's having a nervous breakdown.
It's so wonderful.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
I will if you will!
He just got fed up with all the other boring old barrage balloons and decided it was time to have some fun.
Boo! Leave it alone!
They're scared of old fatty.
Why did they have to go and do that?
God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
I love a man in bed, the smell of him, the hairiness rubbing against you, the weight of him. And when they do it to you in the middle of the night and you don't know if you're dreaming or it's really happening to you. That's the best. No guilty feelings. Not that I should have any, wide awake.
Molly!
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
You're having me on, Molly.
Am I? Maybe I am.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
It's easy. I've done it.
Who with?
Pauline.
Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top of her. That's what they do when they know how.
 Boy, that was some air-raid.
Air-raid?
Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.
Let's get married. We'll live in Montreal. I'll teach you French. Je t'aime, mon petit chou.
Don't get smoochy. You'll spoil it.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
He was a lot better this year.
You said that last year, Dad.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
Dad's furious. It was 'God Save The King'.
Jam tart! Jam tart! I got it! I got it!
Jesus Christ! This is Christmas?
The for my annual toast. Charge your glasses.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson... (savours each name, smiles, shakes is head, has a special emphasis or tone of voice for every one of them.) ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
Father, that's enough now
And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.
Do we have to listen to this nonsense every year? You're drunk, Dadda. Sit down.
...Betty Browning...Betty, let me tell you something. I'm seventy three years old, I've seen half the wonders of the world and I never laid eyes on a finer sight than the curve of Betty Browning's breasts...
It was Sheila, Grandpa.
What's that?
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
I made it up!
What's wrong?
What is it?
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
Where?
I don't know?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
I swear I don't know. (offers her a little box) Here's your Christmas present.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Please yourself.
What is it, pet?
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
We've missed them. They've gone. (turns back to the Sergeant) Can't you tell me where? You can see I'm not a spy.
I would if I could, but I can't.
He'll write as soon as he can.
Sure, he will. You'll meet again  don't know where, don't know when. But in the meantime, I am free tomorrow night.
I found it! I found it!
You needn't have bothered, Bill.
That letter this morning, was it from Bruce?
What did he say?
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
What's that?
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
Wow!
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford
Who pays for them?
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
Happy days. (watches Bill's efforts with the ball) When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
Thanks.
 There'll be blue birds over, The white cliffs of Dover...
 ...tomorrow. Just you wait and see...
There goes another Ford 8, Uncle Mac.
 Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
You miss her. I know you do.
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking. And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.
He could always make me laugh.
We did the decent thing.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
If I saw this at the pictures, I'd be crying my eyes out, but I can't shed a tear for myself.
Dawn! Dawn!
Thank God you're safe.
Was this your house, madam?
I didn't know there was a raid.
It wasn't a bomb, just afire.
What do you mean, a fire?
It happens in wartime as well, you know.
I just wished I'd worn my nylons.
My ration books are in there.
My shrapnel collection should be all right.
Oh yes, I should think so.
PAULINE has appeared and smiles knowingly as she watches. Other children gather. ROGER picks himself up and the gang beats a retreat.
Mac, look! Some of the snaps are saved.
This coat should fit you Grace. And here are some things for Dawn. And a few bits for the kitchen.
Thank you, Evelyne.
It's only a house. We still have each other.
I don't care about the house, I just hate all these people watching us and being nice.
Coming. Coming. Deliverance is at hand. All will be well.
Another world, eh Billy? And not twenty miles from Picadilly.
Are you strong enough for another shock? You're going to be a grandma. (waves across the river at her own Grandmother.) Hello, Grandma.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
It's not. It's happening to me.
responding to GRACE
What did I do to deserve this?
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
 How long?
Three and a half months.
As long as that? Well, all right. Why not? It's nearly summer. Let the nippers run wild.
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
 You might still have a house.
 I wish it could all have been different.
Look after yourself, Grace.
Everything I have left in the world is in this little boat.
Can I try?
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
I shall teach you the ways of the river. Another year in that awful suburb and you would be past saving. Look, they're coming this way! The future on the march. I curse you, Volt, Watt and Amp.
Have a listen. See if you can hear anything.
You're icy cold. A shock like that could give me a miscarriage.  That's an idea, do it again.
Breakfast, all!
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
 Up to six weeks, I think.
How are we going to cope?
Nettle soup, like we did in the Great War. Very nourishing. Bill and I will catch fish. The river fowl will be laying eggs soon. We'll hunt, We'll forage. We'll overcome.
What about tea and sugar. Clever Dick?
Keep still! Nobody move!
 Mother!! Fetch my gun.
What's that, dear?
Never let a rat creep up on you.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
Up, two, three. Throw the pole forward, let it slide through your fingers.  Don't push until it hits the bottom.
Now check that spinner.
No luck, Grandpa.
 Good day, ma,am. Greetings Edward.
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
Wasn't it lovely?
Let it go. Let it go.
Stay put. Hang on.
Now there's a lesson for life. Never give up the punt for the pole.
No word from Bruce, my pet?
All men are beasts, darling.
That's what I like about them.
Dawn! Really!
All hens and no cocks. Too many women in the family. They're a different species from us, Bill. Love them, but don't try to understand them. That road leads to ruin. Let's make a nuisance of ourselves.
You look frustrated, Hope. That husband of yours still can't rise to the occasion?
I won't have the husbands here. All four married duds, including your mother.
He's a menace. He ought to be locked up.
Don't let him get his claws into you Billy, Grace.
They'll tame you if they can, cage you and feed you tidbits. Better retreat to prepared positions.
Bags I bat first.
That was a googly!
I know.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
Why?
Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
It's only a game, Grandpa.
He gropes under the water and hauls up a night fishing line. SUE shares his disappointment when there is no catch.
Where's the fish? No fish, no supper. Be off with you and don't come back empty handed.
I'm scared of going back without any fish. I hate Grandpa.
Looks like a stray bomber. He's lost his squadron.
This is going too far, young man.
But Grandpa, you said...
I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil...
It looks a bit fishy to me.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
It's like feeding of the five thousand. It's a miracle.
Well,lad. So it's miracles now, is it?
They'll stink the place out by morning. Why not invite all your friends to supper, Grandpa.
I have no friends, only relations.
Ignore him, the bastard.
Dan! It's me!
Keep going. Stay on this bank.
Give me a chance to explain.
I'm going to kill you, Sue Rohan.
Couldn't write...secret posting...came as soon as I heard about the baby.
I went AWOL to be with you. I'm a deserter.
Oh, Bruce, Bruce. What have I done?
I missed you so much.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
So you're going to be a grandfather.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
And now we're glad you did.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
And absent bridegrooms!
And the bride.
The bride.
And here's to my CO. He's wangled me a posting close to home. He said your house burns down, your daughter gets married, you're always on compassionate leave. You might as well stay down there!
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
Fair enough.  The river.
The river.
And loyal friends.
...and good and faithful wives.
We hope, and trust.
And grumpy grandfathers.
Since you are shortly to join our ranks, I throw down the gauntlet. A cricket match. You and Mac against Bill and me. Back garden.
You know Mac played for Surrey Seconds, and I opened for the Indian Army. Are you sure...
 It's an olive branch. Take it. It's the best he can do.
We're putting you in to bat.
Fine delivery, Bill, Good length. Turned a bit too.
 Give him the you-know-what.
Very well, Grandpa.
I think it was a googly.
Googly. You didn't spot it either.
I taught him how and now he turns it against me.
The law of life. Cruel, isn't it?
The wicked old bugger.
This boy will make his way in the world.
I'm proud of you.
Clive, go for the doctor. It's Dawn. She's in labour.
Hot water! Lots of hot water!
What for?
I don't know. They always say that at the pictures.
She just went to the toilet, and it came out.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
It's all sticky.
...it is not the end. It is not the beginning.
I scrumped it. I nearly got caught. They chased me for ages.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
 Well, for the baby, really.
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Only till they get you into the local school.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
Strapping fellows playing silly buggers with a war on. Outrageous.
All you do is knock the sense out of them and fill them up with muck.
Grandpa! There's no school! It's been hit by a bomb!
I have to hand it to you, Bill, you come up with some good ones. Go back and take your medicine.
It's true.
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
Apparently so.
