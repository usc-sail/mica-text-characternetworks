Derek?
What are you going to do with that? CUT TO:
This is coming down.
Why? BETH'S VOICE Do you want people to think we put it up?
 I don't know. I kind of like it.
Please tell me you're joking.
All I'm saying, before we take it down... maybe we should try it out.  You know. Christen the new house.
And what do you suggest we use for a bed?
What do we need a bed for when we've got a fine shag carpet?
 Because I'm gonna have fine shag carpet tattoos all over my --
Don't you have to go to work?
 Told `em I'd be late.
What about...
Kyle? That boy wouldn't wake up if a nuclear bomb went off.
Maybe not, but the movers...
Won't be here for another hour.
Derek, you are so bad.
Isn't THAT why you married me?
NT. LIVING ROOM
Want me to stay?     Crack the whip on these guys?
No. Go to work and earn that promotion. Somebody's got to pay for all this.
Gage/Bendix?
Excuse me?
I couldn't help but notice we're both going to Seven.
Right.   Gage/Bendix.   I work there.
I thought you might.
Do you have an appointment with us?
Why?   Do I look like a client?
Actually, you do.
 ell, I hate to shatter the illusion but I'm just a lowly temp.
 You're a temp?
Just here for the day.
Well, you could have fooled me.
I'm beginning to think these heels were a big mistake.
I should have worn my track shoes. They've got me running all over town picking up these disclosure --
God, I'm such a klutz.
No problem. Happen to anybody.
Thanks.   I owe you one.
 Are you following me?
No. I'm taking these files to Mister Charles' office. They said it was this way.
Derek Charles?
I guess you probably know him.
Oh, yeah, I know him.  Kind of an asshole, takes himself waaaay too seriously. But don't tell him I said that.     L ISA I could get you into trouble?
Deep trouble.
Morning, Derek. How's the new house?
Total chaos. Lucky for me, I sneaked out as soon as the movers showed up.
Beth must have loved that.
If she calls mad -- and she will -- tell her I'm in a meeting.
Remember who used to sit at this desk? She'll know I am lying.
 Good point.
 Can I help you?
That's Derek Charles?
Yes.
 Watch it, girl. He's married.
The good ones are always married.
 Or straight.
AGE  Did you talk to our German friend, Herr Ganz?
Matter of fact, I just got off the line to Berlin.
And?
Ganz doesn't like the way the Stock Market's been gyrating and he thinks the hedge fund wave is about to crest.
You think he's right?
Hell, no. I think he's a hundred percent wrong. We haven't even gotten close to that point yet. Hedge fund demand is coming from individual investors which is why it's gaining mainstream acceptance. You know Ganz. He gets paranoid when anything goes mainstream. He started making Auf Wiedersehen noises but I managed to talk him into a private equity portfolio instead... to the tune of 155 mil.
 I knew there was a reason I promoted you. No offense, Ben.
None taken, Joe. I'm just honored to be allowed to exist in Derek's world.
Good. I want you to throw Derek all your support on this one. hat's when Lisa walks by on the other side of the glass. Gage perks up.
Whose legs are those?
Never seen `em before.
I think she's one of the temps.
You mean temptress...
Remind me to call that agency and have them send over a couple more just like her. Doesn't hurt to have a little eye candy around the office, does it, boys?
I scored an extra Lakers ticket for tomorrow night. Think you can get free?
I'm moving into a new house.
So?
Do I look like a man who wants a divorce?
I could call and say it's a work emergency.
Thanks, but I think I'll stay married instead.
 Coward.
Good night, Mister Charles.
You punk'd me.
 Sorry but you set me up.
 Don't worry. I'll get my revenge.    And by the way, you might like to know everybody who works here strongly disagrees with you.
About what?
About Derek Charles being an asshole. They all say he's the nicest guy in the firm.
Well, that just proves he's got `em all fooled.
And he's humble, too.   I'm Lisa, by the way. Lisa Sheridan.
Well, it was nice to meet you, Lisa Sheridan. Good luck with your next job --
Actually, they're keeping me on a few more days, so I'll probably see you on Monday.
Damn.   Almost made it.
Your turn.
Hey, little man. What's wrong?    You should be...  Uh oh. Poopy diaper. Beth...
 I've been changing him all day.
Whew.   What's that woman been feeding you?
Well, we toasted the house --
Toasted Kyle --
Your promotion --
But I've saved the most important toast for last...  To my beautiful wife who I love and adore more than anything in the world.
And to my handsome husband. I asked for the moon and he gave me the stars.
Derek...
 Uh huh?
How would you feel about trying out that mirror again? This time in our own bed.
 Yeah? Give the magic mirror another test drive?
You know how I like looking at your sexy butt.
 Beth, you are so bad.
Isn't that WHY you married ME?
Hi.   Remember me?
Lisa Sheridan, Girl Temp.     Where's Patrick?
Out with the flu. I did some trading with the other temps and wrangled your desk. I hope that's okay. EREK Uh... sure.
Hey Marge.
Good morning, Derek.
Grab your pad and follow me.
I put a memo on your desk about the Christmas party this Friday.
Is it that time already?
Why don't they invite spouses?
How's that?
To the Christmas party.    It says "for employees only."
It's like that in most companies. They think people are more inhibited in front of their spouses, less likely to kick back and enjoy themselves and mingle with co-workers, which is what the party is about.
So, does this party get pretty wild?
Just the opposite.
Well that's no fun.
called Patrick. He said you like it black with two sugars.
If it's cold, I can run down and nuke it in the Break Room.
 No, it's perfect.
Fire away.
Well, it's Monday and first thing on Monday...
I took care of that.
Took care of what?
On Mondays you always send your wife a dozen long-stemmed red roses.  I called to confirm they've been delivered.
Thanks.
I think that's incredibly sweet.   How long have you two been married?
Three years in March.
And you still send her flowers every Monday morning? Lucky girl.
It's kind of a tradition.
Patrick said you started sending them back when Beth worked here as your assistant. Is that how you won her heart?
Well, it took a little more than roses.  We need to run some calls.
 Ready when you are.
AMUSED) Are you always this efficient?
Does that surprise you?
Well, it's just that most of the temps we get here...
I think you'll find I'm not your typical temp.
No.   Definitely not.  Okay not your typical temp... start with Phil Trendle at Emerson... set up a lunch for end of the week. Wherever he wants but push the Water Grill. Then Terry Mills at Imagio. Am I going too fast for you?
No.    Go faster.   I can handle it.
It's a beautiful little park with a duck pond and close enough to push Kyle.
I've already met a dozen other women with kids the same age. One of them, Lauren something asked if we'd like to come over for a barbecue on Saturday.
I don't know. It's shaping up to be a work weekend.
You can work at home and then we'll go to the barbecue. s Beth chats on, Derek gets a weird feeling. Still on the phone, he slowly gets up from his desk and moves quietly to the door. He looks out, expecting to catch Lisa listening in. Instead, she's not at her desk. She's standing several feet away at a file cabinet. She turns and smiles at him.
Do you need me?
Work at the office.     This is home.   Come to bed.
In a sec.
The card that came today with the roses...
Uh huh?
... was addressed "To Betty."
Betty?
 Your other wife? Yeah. Who's Betty?
Blame it on the new girl. Patrick called in sick and I had a temp on my desk. ETH I thought we had a deal. No female assistants.
Honey, I don't control the temp pool.
She pretty?
Just asking...
Yeah, she's pretty... plain.
 I don't care. I want her fired immediately.
Actually, she did a great job... aside from the card.
Night, Derek.
Night... Betty.
Hope you don't mind us dropping in unannounced.
You kidding? This is a treat.
Sheila's meeting us for lunch at Central Market. Then I'm taking Kyle to the Grove.  And who are we going to see at the Grove?
 Santa!
 You want to come?   Get your picture taken on Santa's lap?
I'd love to but I'm all jammed up.     But say hi to your sister.
That guy she was seeing, the one we met at Thanksgiving... Jack. EREK The one she said was perfect.
Apparently he's not so perfect.   He told her he just wants to be FWB.
FWB?
Friends With Benefits.
What does that mean?
You know.    Sex but no commitments.
And Sheila's got a problem with that?
Excuse me.
Lisa, this is my wife Beth.       Beth, Lisa. She's temping for Patrick.
 Hi.
It's great to meet you, Mrs. Charles. eyes lighting up) And this must be Kyle. I can already tell he's going to grow up to be a heartbreaker.
Hi, Kyle.     I'm Lisa.
Kyle, say hello.
He can say hello. He's usually not this shy around strangers.
What a handsome boy.  He looks just like you.
Actually, most people think he takes after Beth.
Talk about the perfect family. The three of you should be on a magazine cover.
I hope my husband's not working you too hard.
 He is. But I like it. I'm learning a lot.  Joe Gage needs to see you when you get a minute.
Well, that's our cue to leave.    We just dropped in to say hi.  Come on, big boy.
It was great to meet you... Beth.
You, too... Laura.
Lisa.
Excuse me?
It's Lisa.      You said Laura.
I did?
Sorry.   Lisa.
 Bye, Kyle. Say hi to Santa for me.
 That was intentional.
Wasn't me. Blame "Betty."    So what's the deal with her?
What do you mean?
She knew I was taking Kyle to Santa.
So?
So she was obviously listening at the door.
Well, she probably didn't know when to come in.
I thought you said she was plain. Derek, that girl may be a lot of things but one of them is not plain.
How would I know?    I only have eyes for you.      B ETH  Oh, you are so slick.
Come on. I'll walk you to the elevator. You can say hi to the old gang.  Ever miss it?
I like to think I traded up.
Hey, Patrick. Feeling better?
Much. Thanks.  You know it's going to take more than the flu to keep me away from that Christmas party.
Not sure we can say the same for Marge...
You get around don't you?
Poor thing called in with a fever...
Yeah... She's not speaking to me at the moment.
Alright.   You two behave yourselves out here...
 So, how many times did you get busted listening in on Derek's calls?
 I'm way too devious to ever get caught. Besides, I thought all you assistants listened in.
 We do.
How long have you worked here?
Ten years this Spring.
I'll bet you know more about what goes on behind these closed doors than anybody.
Oh you got that right girl.    I know all the dirty little secrets. ISA Well maybe we should grab a drink some night after work for a little girl talk.
 Listen, honey, if you think you can buy my silence with a couple of Cosmo's... you're right.
Sorry.     I thought everybody was at lunch.
I should go...
No. Stay. I was just gonna take this back to my office.
Anything I can do to help?     I mean... if you want to talk about it.
It's nothing.
Most people I know don't cry over nothing.
with humor) You think I was crying?     This is just my allergies.
Uh huh.     What are you allergic to?
Men, apparently. Actually it's more like they're allergic to me.
Boyfriend trouble?
It's stupid really.  This guy I've been seeing just calls and dumps me. Middle of the day. No warning. No explanation. Just "I don't think we should see each other anymore."
OUCH!!! That's pretty cold.    How long were you together?
Two months. small laugh) Actually, it was one of my longer lasting relationships. I don't know what it is but sooner or later I just seem to scare men off.  I'm starting to think there's something wrong with me.
 Nothing wrong with you. Your boyfriend's a fool, that's all.
I wish I could believe that.
Maybe you just haven't met the right guy yet.
I'm beginning to think all the good ones are taken. D
Look, I'm no expert but if it didn't work out, maybe it wasn't meant to be. When the right guy comes along... you'll know it.
Is that how it was with you and Beth?
Actually, yeah.      We both knew pretty quick.
Love at first sight?
It does happen.
Great.     Now I'm jealous.
Why?
She's got it all.   Perfect husband, perfect child, perfect marriage.
Nobody's perfect. There are problems in every relationship. The important thing is to keep moving forward. trying to buck her up) Don't get down on yourself. You're a bright, attractive girl. Any man would be lucky to have you.
Oh, yeah.     Right.
No, really. If I was single...
But you're not.
I just meant...
I know. You're just trying to make me feel better.  And you have.
Thanks, Derek.
 Hang in there. It'll happen.
en appears in the doorway, grins at Derek.
What was that all about?
Poor kid got dumped by her boyfriend.
Really? I wouldn't mind taking up the slack. That is one hot piece of ass there.  Like you haven't noticed.
 Hey, I'm a happily married man.   And so are you.
Doesn't mean we can't look.
Not like the old days, back when you could get away with a little office nookie on the side and not get nailed for it.  Don't give me that "I'm appalled" look. That's how you got together with Beth, isn't it?
Ben, if you're looking to start something with that girl...
You saw her first?
Fuck off.
Besides, I don't think I'm her type.     Now you on the other hand...
Ben, do me a favor...
All I'm just sayin' is a lot of these single gals see the work place as a hunting ground. cocking his finger like a gun) And this one's got you in the cross hairs.
On your way home, can you pick up those Baby Einstein DVD's for you know who.
I'll have to do it tomorrow.      Office party's tonight.
I forgot. Well, if you drink too much, take a cab, okay? EREK If it's anything like last year, I'll be home early.  Kyle, I want you to eat this.
Santa!
Yeah, Santa. And he's coming soon. So eat. Don't you know Santa only brings presents to boys who eat all their food?
 This seat taken?
 No. Be my guest...
 Still the best burger in town.
 ... And the best Margarita.
 Really?
We used to cut loose here after a long day at work.
Work hard, play hard.   Right?
 Back in the day...  How's that boyfriend trouble coming?
Keep moving forward, right? EREK Exactly.
How about you, Derek?   What's the grand plan?
You know, run the company by 35. Jet by 40. Retire to my private island and own the Lakers by 50.
Lakers suck.
Not with me in charge.
You want one?
What?
A margarita?
Oh, I don't know.
C'mon big talker... it's Christmas time. Works dead --
I won't tell if you don't.
All right. One.     What do you like? Strawberry?
Rocks. Salt...
 Well, if it isn't the Office Asshole.
That's Mister Office Asshole to you.
I'm impressed.      You can dance.
All those years watching Soul Train.
 I wasn't sure I was going to come tonight.
Why not?
Well, it's not like I've been here that long.
I'm sure everybody's glad you decided to show up.
Even you?
What do you mean "even me?" I'm your number one supporter around here.
 Uh oh.
How did that get there?
 Maybe a quick one on the cheek? If we don't, people will really suspect there's something going on.
Guess we'll just have to take that chance.
 Coward.
You're not thinking about bailing, are you? Fun's just getting started. Remember last year? Sally Sloane did a table dance. e indicates a pretty secretary LAUGHING and accepting another drink.
I give her one more drink, then stand back.   How about you, buddy? Need a re- fill? Come on, where's your holiday spirit?
With Beth and Kyle.       I'm gonna take a piss and sneak out.
You're no fun.
 What are you doing?
Lisa --
EREK Lisa, stop --
Why?
Are you out of your --
For god's --
Oh, come on...
 Hey, who's there?
Somebody in there?
 Wait. Where are you going?
 You've got the wrong idea!
Living dangerously, aren't we?
Oh, Patrick, you're such an old queen.  Come on. Dance with me.
 'll bet you've never been this close to an actual woman.
Honey, I've never been this close to an actual man.
 How was the party?
I only stayed for two drinks.
That dull, huh?
Beth...
Not tonight, honey, okay?   I'm really tired.
Good morning.
Morning.
You okay, bro?
Yeah.   I'm fine.
You should have stuck around.
What?
The Christmas party. Hank in Human Services tossed his cookies on the Christmas tree.
 Really? Sorry I missed that.
Bad time?
 No...
Joe wants to know if you're done with the Ganz portfolio.
Tell him he'll have it end of the day.
 Thanks.
You're working Joe's desk?
Just for today. light laugh) He's a real screamer, isn't he?
Don't let him fool you.   His bark really is as bad as his bite.
Okay if I take off?
Yeah, go home.
See you tomorrow.
 What are you --
I owe you an apology for the Christmas party. I think I sort of took you by surprise.
 We both had a few drinks.   Just forget it.       L ISA What if I can't?
Lisa... nothing happened.
All right, have it your way.   Nothing happened.
 You really need to get out of my car.
Why?
This is so not right.
Relax. Nobody's around to see us now. God, I almost went insane today, didn't you? Having to go pretend like I was concentrating on work when all I could think about --
 Lisa, get out of my car!
 Derek, what's wrong? What did I do?
I don't know if you're just dense or what's wrong with you but I want you to understand something. There's nothing going on between us. I would never -- never -- jeopardize my job with a co- worker.
Maybe you are an asshole. Wow.
Get out!
 Beth? Honey?
In here.
There's something I need to...
What's wrong?
I've been on the phone for the last hour with Rachel MORE) ( Hendricks.
CONTINUED: She found out Tim's been having an affair with a neighbor and it's been going on for the last year and a half.
 Tim? Really?
At first I couldn't even conceive of it. They've always seemed to be so much in love, totally devoted to each other.
Tim... told her?
Just blurted it out last night when he came home from work. Then he said he was moving out. You know they've got three kids. Poor Rachel's a wreck.
Yeah.    That's tough.
Tough?    It's a disaster.   If it was me...
Beth, you know I'd never cheat on you.
I know.
Tim's an idiot. ETH He's a son of a bitch.  What did you want to tell me?
Forget it. Just a little problem at work.
CONTINUED:  Nothing I can't take care of.
Why didn't you tell me?
There was nothing to tell.
Nothing to tell? She grabbed your cock? Flashed her tits in your car? Come on, man. I thought I was your best friend.
You think this is funny?
I just... jeez. I mean, I kinda got she was interested but I never figured she'd...
What the hell did I do?    I was nice to her, that's all.
Sure you didn't lead her on? Just a little? I mean, a pretty girl... it would be normal...
I didn't do a damn thing.
Maybe she thinks she can make the jump from assistant to wife, too?
Thanks.   You're a big help.
Sorry... What are you going to do?
Report it to Human Resources...
Get her fired?
I don't have a choice.
I'd be very careful if I were you. What if she makes trouble and says you came on to her? erek gives Ben a look.       C'mon man...
Look... it's not like you don't have a history of behavior here. When's the last time you had a female assistant on your desk? People are going to wonder.
Then I need to get my side on the record first.
 Wouldn't it be cheaper to just have her killed?
Morning, Mister Charles.
Hi, Connie. Is Hank in?     I need to talk to him.
 Derek? That you?
Hey, Hank.
What's up?
Well, it's sort of a personal matter.   I need to talk to you about one of the temps, Lisa Sheridan.
Right.   She worked your desk for awhile.
 Listen, Hank, this going to be a little awkward...
If you're here to file a complaint about her performance, save your breath. Her agency called this morning and said she wouldn't be coming in any more. They already sent over a replacement. EREK  She quit? They give a reason?
No. Did you have some kind of a problem with her?
Well, I just thought she was unqualified, sort of in over her head. But if she already quit...
Looks like she beat you to it.
 Yeah.
Anything else?
No.   I guess not.
How's the new house?
New house is great. a smile) Couldn't be better.
Tell Beth I said hi.
I will. Listen. We'll have you and Kathy over some night when we're more settled.
Sounds like a plan.
Well?
She quit.
Really?
Yeah.
Come on, bro.     That's good news.   Problem solved.
 Looks that way, doesn't it?
Not a bad little Christmas present.
Hans? Derek. How was your Christmas? Well, you people invented it. You got the prospectus? Great. Look it over. I think it's gonna be a happy new year for all of us.
God,   it's after three. That's the last time   I'm going out on New Years Eve. Next   year we'll celebrate here at home. Just   you, me and Kyle.
I'm just gonna check my e-mail and come to bed.
Can't it wait?
It's already tomorrow in Berlin. Ganz was supposed to send me his approval. That's probably him.
Ganz?
What was that?
 Nothing. I gotta get a new spam blocker.
Forget it. He'll call you in the morning. Come to bed.
Remember the last time Joe had one of his weekend work retreats?
How could I forget?   I had a hangover for a week after.
Any women coming this year?
No, just the usual suspects. Joe says it's going to be a male bonding experience.
I can just picture you guys in the hotel jacuzzi, getting in touch with your innermost feelings.
 Hopefully, they'll all get drunk and crash early. Or if I'm really lucky... drown in the jacuzzi.
Call me tonight.
I will.
I didn't order this.
It's from the lady at the bar. erek turns and peers at the crowded bar area. He catches a flash of a young woman in a tight dress seated on a stool. But a crowd of people move into his line of vision and when they clear, the woman is gone.
Derek, you okay?
I'm fine.      Just thought I saw somebody.
Somebody you know?     Or somebody you'd like to know?
No way.   You can't tempt this guy.
Who could blame him with a wife like Beth.
Speaking of Beth, I said I'd give her a call before she puts Kyle to bed. I'll be right back.
Hurry back. This party's just getting started.
Hey, honey. It's me.
How's the male bonding?
They're all getting wasted. Any minute now, Joe's going to suggest the Jacuzzi.
Well, if your future depends on putting on a bathing suit and hot tubbing it with a bunch of drunks... Derek? You there?
I have to go.
Wait.   Kyle wants to say good night.
 They're yelling for me to come back.
It'll just take a second...
Say good night to Daddy.
 Beth, I'll call you later.
I'll be in bed -- Derek?
I can always tell from the pained look on your face when you're talking to Beth.
 How did you know I'd be here?
I've got my sources. slight frown) What's wrong? You don't look happy to see me.
Why did you come here?
You said you could never be with someone you work with. (when he doesn't seem to "get IT") That's why I quit. So we could be together.
 Lisa, you need to leave.
 Or what? You'll make a scene? 
CONTINUED: Call security? What would Joe and Ben and the others think? I'll tell you what they'd think. They'd think we arranged it. And in a way, we did.
This hook-up was on the books from the day we met. EREK What are you talking about?
One of us   has to take control and I guess it's me.    So you go back, say your good nights to   the boys and I'll be waiting in my room.    610.
I'm not coming to your room.
Would you rather I came to yours?
You're crazy... sick.      You need help.
I know. I need help.  Help me, Derek.
Stay away from me!
All right, Derek. You play your games...  ... and I'll play mine.
Beth, I'm sorry --
Beth?   It's Ben. Where the hell are you, bro?
I'm right here.     Coming back in.
Come on, it's early. We'll go to my room and plunder the mini-bar, charge it all to Joe.   D EREK Can't, man. That last drink totally kicked my ass. I need to lie down.
All right, be that way. But don't forget. Nine o'clock in the California Room. Joe's big rah-rah to the troops.
Shhhhh.
 No..
Hush, baby.
I'm going to take real good care of you.
Housekeeping!
Housekeeping!
 Later! Come back later!
Okay.    I come back.
Morning.
You've got to get out of here!
What are you talking about?
Leave!   You've got to go!
Derek, come on... EREK I want you out of here!
Why?   You worried somebody's gonna catch us?
Just get the hell out.
 We woke up a little grumpy this morning, didn't we?
Derek, what is wrong with you?
All right.     Have it your way.
 Fuck... fuck... fuck.
 Thank god. We were about to send out a search party.
Sorry.   Overslept.
It's Beth.
What about her?
She's here. MYSTIFIED) I'll be right back.
Here's your wife, sir.
I thought you might need an excuse to get out of there. How about some lunch?
Lunch?
It's gorgeous outside and I made a reservation at --
What do you think this is?
The morning after?
 We didn't do anything last night.
But you can't remember, can you?
It didn't happen!
Derek, not so loud.   You'll cause a scene.
That's exactly what we Right.   A scene. need.
What are you doing?
What I   should have done last night. Taking   you inside to tell Joe and the others   whatever you want. They'll know you're   out of your mind. e yanks her toward the door.
 Why are you trying to ruin this?
THERE IS NO THIS!!!
Don't say that.
Godammit!
I'm sorry...
What's wrong with you?   You're acting like a stranger.
Yeah! That's exactly what I am. A stranger, a person you don't know. Now either go inside and tell them your bullshit lies or get the hell out of here.
 You think you can use me, then throw me away? I'm not some piece of garbage, Derek. I'm a human being...
Do it. Hit me. You can do anything you want to me. Don't you know that? Anything.
Don't look at me that way.
How else do you look at somebody who sickens and repulses you? ISA Derek, please...
I don't care what you do or what you say. What goes on in that twisted mind of yours. It doesn't matter because the truth is, there's never going to be anything between us. So go ahead, Lisa... do your worst.
Derek, you drinking?
Not tonight, man.   I'm sticking to ice tea.
 No. No fucking way...
Goddamn it, Lisa.
Lisa, get up.
Get up or I'll drag you out and throw you in the hall.
 This is 622. There's a woman in my room, she's taken an overdose of prescription pills -- Ambien. You need to get the paramedics and security up here right away. Please hurry.
 Lisa!
Oh god...
Lisa!   Wake up, goddamn it...              C UT TO:
All right, Mister Charles, let me get this straight. E) (MOR
CONTINUED: This girl you barely know, works in your office, fantasizes you're having an affair and when you reject her, she tries to commit suicide in your bed.
I know how it sounds but, yeah, that's pretty much it.
This affair...
There WAS NO affair.
So she just... made it up in her head? With no help from you?
Maybe I was too nice to her, said something she took the wrong way, I don't know. All I know is I did not lead her on.
And you had no idea she'd be at the hotel?
None. I don't even know how she got in my room.
Apparently she told one of the housekeepers she was your wife and lost her key.
Doesn't that prove she did this on her own?
All it proves is she lost her key.
She never had a key.
Look, Mister Charles, I don't care if you were or weren't banging this girl. I just need to get your version for my report.
CONTINUED: Besides, if it's a question of innocence, I'm not the one you have to convince. EREK What do you mean?
Let's just say I wouldn't like to explain a situation like this to my husband.
I'll be right back.
How is she?
They pumped her out in time. Doctor says she's groggy and disoriented. Probably tomorrow they'll move her out of ICU and up to the fifth floor for a psychiatric evaluation. All suicides are put on 72 hour hold, it's standard.
Did she say anything?
As a matter of fact, she was lucid long enough to give the doctor a name to call in case of emergency. He wrote it down. Here.
Still want to stick to your story?
 Tell me everything.   From the beginning.
How could you let this happen?
You think I encouraged it?
Maybe you liked it.
Beth...
What man wouldn't? The attentions of a pretty young girl? I can just see those adoring blue eyes batting at you every time you told her how pretty she looked or what a nice dress --
Stop it, Beth. You know I never said those things.
You must have said something. Done something to give her the idea.
If I did, it wasn't intentional.
She was in your bed, Derek! You spent the night together and you want me to believe nothing happened?
I was passed out... drunk.     Nothing happened.
Damn you, Derek.   Damn you.
I love you, Beth. I love Kyle and the life we have together. I would never do anything to screw that up. This girl is disturbed. She's seriously disturbed and for some reason, she fixated on me. ETH Why?
I don't know. She's crazy.
You should have told me. From the very beginning, you should have told me.
I know.
Why didn't you?
At first I thought it was no big deal. And then... I was just embarrassed. I didn't know how to explain it to you without looking...
Guilty?
I said I was wrong.
Did she know about us, Derek?
What?
How we met?
Don't do this, Beth.    You'll make yourself sick.
I'm already sick.
Honey, I know I screwed up...
But I've told you the truth.    I have to know you believe me.
 I don't know what to believe. All I know is, I need to be alone for awhile.
Beth, don't --
I need to be alone --
Miss Reynolds? I'm Monica Reyes.
Come in. I'm sorry I'm such a mess but they won't let me take a shower or wash my hair.  Apparently I'm still on suicide watch.
I'm a police officer assigned to your case. How are you feeling?
Well, still a bit groggy from the medication. But it isn't stopping me from feeling ashamed for all the trouble I've caused.
Do you feel like talking about the other night?
Have you spoken to Derek?
Yes.
And he's all right?
Relatively speaking.
When can I see him?
See him?
Derek.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Why?
Miss Sheridan, I don't think Mister Charles wants to speak to you or continue any kind of contact.
Then why did he send these? Really?
 He sent you flowers? ISA Peonies.   My favorite.
When did these show up?
A few hours ago.    They're lovely, aren't they?
Can you tell me what happened at the hotel, why you were there.
Didn't Derek tell you?
I'd like to hear your version.
There's not a lot to tell. We got together at the hotel and you can guess what we did.
Slept together.    Had sex.
Of course.
Derek denies it.
He's just being a gentleman, trying to protect me.
I see.     Go on.
The next day when Derek told me his wife wouldn't give him a divorce and that we could never see each other again, I guess I over reacted. BEAT) I didn't realize he was just being noble.
Noble?
He was thinking about his little boy, Kyle... what the breakup might do to him. He's not even two, you know. My parents broke up when I was pretty young. It leaves a scar that never really heals.
So you believe Mister Charles is in love with you? L
Read the card. Derek and I belong together and nothing can change that. But I do feel bad about his wife.
You do?
I'm not a home-wrecker. I'm not stealing him away. Their marriage is dead and Beth is in denial. It can't be easy to find out that the man she loves is in love with another woman. I just hope she doesn't do something foolish. strange smile) You know the old saying.
What's that?
"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."
You take it easy now.   We'll talk again.
I don't have to tell you how an incident like this could impact the company. Even the slightest whiff of impropriety...
There was no impropriety, Joe. This is just the sick fantasy of a very disturbed girl.
Who might retaliate by hitting us with a sexual harassment lawsuit.
There was no sexual harassment. If anything, I'm the one who was sexually harassed.  I can't believe this is happening to me. It's like a nightmare.
By now, you're probably wishing you had fucked her.
For all the trouble it's costing you.  Sorry. Bad joke.
Goddamit, Joe, if there's an injured party here, it's me.
Derek, calm down. I believe you and you know I'll back you up all the way. But if I find out there was something going on, I won't have a choice.
That's not going to happen because there's nothing to find out.
Good. Then you have nothing to worry about. Meantime I'm going to put Ben on the Ganz account.
But Ganz is my client --
Look, maybe you should take some time off. Just til this blows over.
Sorry to interrupt. Derek, there's a Detective Reyes here to see you.
She obviously ordered the flowers for herself.
With your credit card.
My secretary keeps all my personal information on her computer. Lisa must have accessed it when she was working my desk.
You think I sent the flowers?   I'd have to be as crazy as she is.
There's more.
More?
This is a print out of Lisa's blog. It's sort of a diary she was keeping.
It's a rather graphic and detailed account of your various sexual liaisons together. D
What?
You can read them for yourself but I should warn you they're a little... X- rated.
 This is... none of this ever happened. I was never at her apartment. I never even touched her, let alone did any of this...
According to those entries, you're quite the accomplished lover, Mister Charles. And you made promises to her, promises to divorce your wife and marry her...
You can't possibly believe this.
Whether I believe it or not is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is that she believes it.
There's got to be something I can do to protect myself... my family.
You could file a restraining order.    But that may not be necessary.
Why not?
Lisa's left town. She was released in the custody of an older sister yesterday. Her sister flew down from San Francisco and took her back. Lisa's agreed to check herself into a neuropsychiatric hospital up there.
 Well, I can't say I'm unhappy to hear she's gone. Maybe now she can get the help she needs.
ith any luck, Mister Charles, you'll never hear from her again.
 "Four little ducks went out one day... over the hill and far away..."
You've got our cell numbers so if there's any problem, don't hesitate to call us, okay?
Come on, honey.     Samantha knows what to do, don't you?
I've got four little brothers.    Trust me. I'm really good at this.
 I don't know. Maybe we should...
No way. Do you know how hard it was to get these reservations? Come on, we agreed. This is an important night. And I am not gonna waste you in that outfit.  She looks fantastic, doesn't she?
Like a movie star. erek takes Beth by the arm.
Everything's gonna be fine.
 Okay, but you call us.
Lock this.     We'll be back by ten.
Have fun.
I haven't seen you looking this relaxed and beautiful in weeks.
I'd forgotten what this was like... the two of us out together.
Yeah.    It's been awhile.
 So... there's hope?
It's not that easy.
I need you to believe me.
Could we get another bottle, please?
Derek, not everybody gets drunk and does things they regret.
I keep telling you I didn't do any thing to regret.
 I am telling you... you did.
 Hi, I'm Beth's friend Allie.      She's expecting me.
Mister and Mrs. Charles are out.
Out?
They went to dinner.
What? Beth told me to drop by. That's strange. Oh well, I have something for Kyle. I'll just run up and give it to him.
You can't.     He's sleeping.
Oh, I won't wake him.
Maybe you should come back.
But I'm here right now. Why should I... oh, I see. Just doing your duty. Good girl. You know what, let me call Beth.
 Beth? Hey, girlfriend. It's Allie. Where am I? Where are you! I'm at your place. You told me to come by. to Samantha) No it's okay. She forgot.  No, Samantha was a little concerned so I said I'd call you.  Yeah. Okay, honey. You two have a great night. (to Samantha; holding out the CELL) Oh, wait. Did you want to talk to her?
 Beth, I'll call you tomorrow.
 Great. This will only take me a minute.
Thanks, Samantha.   Nice meeting you.
 You, too.
UT TO:
It's his birthday tomorrow.
I know.
I told him we'd take him to Legoland.
I'll go on-line tonight and order the tickets. Unless you think you should take him alone.
No. Whatever we're going through, he needs us to be together.
Hey! You guys got back so fast--
Any trouble with Kyle?
No.  He was a doll. THEN) But you just missed your friend.
What friend?
You know. Allie? She was just here... called you on the cell?
 Nobody called me...
Someone was here?     Inside the house?
 You said it was okay.    She said she had something for Kyle...
 Oh my god! Where's Kyle?
In his crib.
How long since she was here?
A couple minutes. What's wrong?
 You said it was okay!
She took him! She took my baby!
Call 911!
Kyle...
We pumped his stomach. X-ray and cat scan came back normal. We'll wait for the blood work but it appears he's completely fine. I don't see any reason why you can't take Bhim home in a couple hours.
 Thank you, Doctor.
Apparently Lisa stole her sister's ID to buy a ticket and board a plane to LA earlier today, then used her sister's credit card to rent a car. The sister didn't even know she was gone until a few hours ago. She said Lisa had been doing well in therapy. She didn't know she checked herself out this morning...
 She was in our house -- alone with our son.
he doctor says he's fine.
Well, I'm not fine. to Reyes; demanding) I want you to find her.
We will. She violated the restraining order so we can arrest her. Look, Mrs. Charles, I know you're upset. I'm a mother, too...
How would you feel if it was your child?
Exactly the same as you.
Find her.
Now what? Am I supposed to go out and buy a gun or something?
She didn't physically harm him.
No, but she could have. Is that the message she's trying to send? EYES Either that or...maybe she was trying to show you she could love him. off Derek's sickened reaction) People like Lisa... their emotions can turn on a dime. What you don't want is her feelings for you to change to rage. I don't know. But there's a good chance she'll try to get in touch. If she does, you need to call me right away. Meanwhile, you might want to beef up your home security.
Derek!
The closet is open and clothes are strewn about. Derek discovers Beth on her knees, holding up a family photograph in which Beth's head has been torn off.
She never left.   She was here the whole time.
What kind of sick person...
It's all right, it's all right...
No Derek! It's not all right!!! We have to do something. We can't live like this.
 Right. Thank you.
Who are you calling?
Guess.
You're not...
 I got her home number from Patrick.
She won't be there.
She can still pick up her messages.
Beth, why are you doing this?
I want her to know who she's dealing with now.
Hi, this is Lisa. I'm not here right now so please leave a message after the beep and I'll get back to you. Have a good one.
 isten to me, you little bitch. This is Beth Charles and I just want you to know that if you ever... ever... come near my child or my house again... I'll kill you.
You're all set, folks. You want me to show you how the system works?
Definitely.
Make sure you set this.
You don't have to tell me.
It can't go on much longer. They're bound to pick her up soon. THEN) Look, if you want me to stay, I'll call in...
No. Go to work. If anything happens, the security patrol can be here in two minutes.  Go. I can take care of myself.
SET.
Hello? Oh hi, Dad.  What's wrong?
Derek Charles' office.      Oh, hi, Beth.
Yeah?
Beth's on 2.
Thanks.     Hi, honey.   Everything okay?
We're fine but I had some not so great news from my Dad.
What's wrong?
Mom went back in for more tests. They wanted to do another biopsy and she's pretty scared. EREK I can imagine.
I'm sure it'll be fine but I thought I'd drive down to San Diego to hold her hand, take Kyle with me.
I'm gonna be stuck here pretty late but I could drive down after...
I don't think that's a good idea. Friday night traffic's gonna be a nightmare and they won't know the results til tomorrow. Why don't you do what you need to do and drive down in the morning?
Are you sure?
Yes.
All right. Say hi to your dad and tell your mom everything's going to be fine, I love her. And call me when you're leaving the house.
I will.
Come on, sweetie. We're gonna take a little trip.
 Legoland?
Much more fun than Legoland.     We're going down to Nana and Poppa's.
Daddy, too?
No. We'll see Daddy tomorrow.     Now... what toys do you want to take?
Derek Charles' office.
 Hey there, girlfriend.
 isa?
How are you?
I've missed you.
I've missed you, too. Everything okay around the office?
 Well, actually...
What?
I'm a little concerned. I heard the Charles' took out a restraining order against you.
 Oh, that. That was Beth's doing. She's not handling this very well. Derek's just waiting for the right time to tell her he's leaving.
I don't think that's gonna happen.
Of course it is...
I'm not sure I should be telling you this...
Patrick, don't be such a drama queen.   I thought we were friends.
We are, we are.
Well?
Well... Beth's headed down to San Diego tonight. Her mother is having some tests done. Derek is driving down first thing in the morning to be by her side. when she doesn't respond) Lisa? Did you hear me?
Patrick, I have to go.
But you just...
I'll talk to you later.
Wait. I wanted to tell you about my date I last night. The one my friend set me up with? The graphic artist? Lisa, you'd be so proud of me. I met him for drinks at -- ISA'S VOICE Patrick.
Yes?
 I really don't care whose dick you sucked last night. I have to go.
 Hey.
We just left the house.
Good.    Did you set the alarm?
The... I think I did. I had to run back in and I can't remember if I re-set it.
Look, don't worry about it.
No, I'm barely down the hill.     I'll do it and call you back.
 Mommy will just be a minute.
Girl, you're even dumber than my husband said you were.  Or did you just forget to take your meds?
You really fucked up this time... coming back to my house. Didn't you get my message?
You can look all you want but you're not getting out of here. ot until I've given you the beating of your life... bitch.
Think you can walk into my house... my bedroom...
My child... my husband!
 Please...
Please?   Please what?   Please don't hurt you?
No!
 You're bleeding. We need to wash that off.
Don't worry. I'm not going to drown you. jerking Lisa's head up) No, no. I'm just getting started...
 Please... I'm sorry...
Too late, bitch.   Sorry won't cut it.
He doesn't love you! I'm the one he wants!  Why can't you get that through your head?
 Careful. You don't want to fall down the stairs.
Did that hurt? Because it looked real painful.
 Please... Beth...
Oh, it's Beth now?    What happened to Betty?
Please. I'll go... I'll leave... I swear I'll never bother you again...
You got that right.
eth turns and faces Lisa with a murderous look. Hugging the wall for support Lisa back away, leaving a bloody smear. Beth advances.
 Beth? Are you there?
Derek!
Beth?
Beth, pick up!
Beth?    Are you there?
Derek!    Oh, Derek, thank god!
Lisa?
Derek, I'm right in the middle of something... let me call you back.
Beth --
I need to speak to Lt. Reyes.   It's an emergency!
he bannister rail begins to crack. Lisa tries to force Beth over, then Beth suddenly swings them around, reversing positions --
Please....
 Let go of the chandelier.
 No...
Let go, Lisa.
 Listen to me. You have to let go right now.
Beth?    Is everything alright here?
 I'm fine. Lisa had an accident.  I have to go. My mother needs me.
Beth, I need to speak with you.
Call me on my cell.
What happened here?
I think you know what happened...  (M
CONTINUED: Now my child has been waiting too long. I am sure my husband will be home soon...
 It's Daddy...
 Beth, I spoke to Reyes.   Are you okay?
It's over, Derek--
Beth...  Tell me baby-- are you hurt?
I should have believed you...
It's gonna be okay, honey.     We're gonna be okay--
 I love you, Derek.
And I love you--
