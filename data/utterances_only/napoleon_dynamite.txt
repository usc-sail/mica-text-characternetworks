What are you gonna do today Napoleon?
Whatever I feel like I want to do. Gosh!
Your current event Napoleon.
Last week, Japanese scientists explaced- placed explosive detonators at the bottom of Lake Loch Ness to blow Nessie out of the water. Sir Curt Godfrey of the Nessie Alliance summoned the help of Scotland's local wizards to cast a protective spell over the lake and it's local residents and all those who seek for the peaceful existence of our underwater ally.
Hey, Napoleon, what'd you do all last summer again?
I told you.  I spent it with my uncle in Alaska hunting wolverines.
Did you shoot any?
Yes, like 50 of 'em. They kept tryin' to attack my cousins.  What the heck would you do in a situation like that?
What kind of gun did you use?
A frickin' 12-gauge.  What do you think?
You think you're funny? Just watch you step.
But I didn't--[Indistinct]
Hey, could I use your guys's phone for a sec?
Is there anything wrong?
I don't feel very good.
Hi
Is Grandma There?
No, she's getting her hair done.
[Sighs]
What do you need?
Can you just go get her for me?
I'm really busy right now.
Well, just tell her to come get me.
Why?
'Cause I don't feel good.
Well, have you talked to the school nurse?
No, she doesn't know anything. Will you just come get me?
No.
Well, will you do me a favor then?
What?
Can you bring me my ChapStick?
No, Napoleon
But my lips hurt real bad.
Just borrow some from the school nurse. I know she has, like, five sticks in her drawer.
I'm not gonna use hers, you sicko.
See ya. [Dial Tone]
[Groans] Idiot!
You do understand English? This isn't that complex. Look, the cafeteria's down the hall to the right and downstairs.
Hey, is that a new kid or something?
Napoleon, this is Pedro. Would you mind showing him where his locker is?
Sure. Come on.
You know, there's, like, a buttload of gangs at this school. This one gang kept wanting me to join 'cause I'm pretty good with a bo staff. Do you ride the bus to school?
No.  I ride by bike.
What kind of bike do you have?
It's a Sledgehammer.
Dang! You got shocks, pegs. Lucky! You ever take it off any sweet jumps?
You got, like, three feet of air that time. Can I try it really quick? [Groans] Dang it!
I love the way... your sandy hair... floats in the air. To me it's like a lullaby. I'm just flying by, oh, so high... like a kite tied to a stake.
How was school?
The worst day of my life.  What do you think?
Well, I want you to go see if Tina wants some of this.
[Sighs] Kip hasn't done flipping anything today.
Look, tonight me and your-- Kip, listen!
What?
Tonight me and your aunt are gonna go visit some friends and we're not gonna be back till tomorrow. We're gettin' a little low on steak, so I got Lyle comin' over tomorrow to take care of it.
Well, what's there to eat?
Knock it off, Napoleon.  Make yourself a dang quesadilla!
Fine!
I'll be back tomorrow.
Stay home and eat all the freakin' chips, Kip!
Napoleon, don't be jealous that I've been chatting online with babes, all day. Besides, we both know I'm training to become a cage fighter.
Since when, Kip?  You have the worst reflexes of all time.
Try and hit me, Napoleon.
What?
I said come down here and see what happens if you try and hit me.
Such an idiot!
Let me see what your best move is.
[Sighs]
I'll go get it.
Geez!
Um, hello. Would you like to look like this?
This is a girl.
Because for a limited time only glamour shots by Deb are 75% off.
I already get my hair cut at the Cuttin' Corral.
Well, maybe you'd be interested in some home-woven handicrafts.
I'm Rex, founder of the Rex Kwon Do Self-Defense System. After one week with me in my dojo, you'll be prepared to defend yourself with the strength of a grizzly... the reflexes of a puma... and the wisdom of a man. So come down today for your free trial lesson!
In here we have some boondoggle key chains. A must-have for this season's fashion.
I already made, like, infinity of those at Scout camp.
Well, is anyone else here? I'm trying to earn money for college.
Your mom goes to college.
Tina, you fat lard.  Come get some dinner.
Tina, eat. Eat the food.
Eat the food!
It'd be nice if you could pull me into town.
My name is Rex, and if you study with my eight-week program you will learn a system of self defense that I developed over two seasons of fighting in the Octagon. It's called Rex Kwon Do! I need a volunteer.
Okay, you'll do. Come up here. Bow to your sensei. Bow to your sensei! Okay. Now I'm gonna give you one chance. One chance, people. Give me your best shot. All right. That was pretty good. Okay. Now, watch this everybody. Grab my arm. The other arm. My other arm. Okay, now watch this. I'm just gonna break the wrist and walk away. Break the wrist, walk away.
Geez!
Okay. It's just that simple.  Now, I want you to kick me. Come on. Kick me. Okay, do it again. Do it again.
Ouch.
Okay. You'll block it every time. Have a seat. Now, in addition to what you just saw if you study with my eight-week program, you're gonna learn these things. First off... Rex Kwin Do, we use the buddy system. No more flyin' solo. You need somebody watching your back at all times! Second off, you're gonna learn to discipline your image. Do you think I got where I am today because I dress like Peter Pan here? Take a look at what I'm wearing, people. Do you think anybody wants a roundhouse kick to the face while I'm wearin' these bad boys? Forget about it. Last off, my students will learn about self-respect. Do you think anybody thinks I'm a failure because I go home to Starla at night? Forget about it! Now, for only $300, you can sign up right now for my eight-week program.
Well, that place was a rip-off.
Hey, Lyle.
Nothin' on here works smooth.
So me and you are pretty much friends by now, right?
Yes.
So, you got my back and everything?
What?
Never mind. Have you heard about the dance?
Yes.
Have you met anyone to ask yet?
No. But I probably will after school.
Who you gonna ask?
That girl over there.
Summer Wheatly? How the heck are you gonna do that?
Build her a cake or something.
Yeah, my old girlfriend from Oklahoma was gonna fly out here for the dance but she couldn't 'cause she's doing some modeling right now.
Is she hot?
See for yourself.
Wow.
Yeah, I took her to the mall to get some glamour shots for her birthday one year.
I like her bangs.
Me too.
How long did it take you to grow that mustache?
A couple of days.
I wish I could grow one. Are you gonna eat your Tots?
No.
Can I have 'em?
You see that girl over there? She came over to my house the other day.
Why?
I don't know, but she left all this crap on my porch.
She's pretty good-looking.
Do you dare me to go talk to her?
Sure.
I see you're drinking one-percent. Is that 'cause you think you're fat? 'Cause you're not. You could be drinking whole if you wanted to. Well, I have all your equipment in my locker. You should probably come get it 'cause I can't fit my nunchakus in there anymore.
Where's your locker?
Hey, can I have one of your key chains?
Hello?
Napoleon, give me some of your Tots.
No, go find your own.
Come on.  Give me some of your Tots.
No. I'm freakin' starved. I didn't get to eat anything today.
G-- Gross. Freakin' idiot!
Tina, come get some ham.
What are you doing here, Uncle Rico?
Your grandma took a little spill at the sand dunes today, broke her coccyx.
What? Since when does she go to the dunes?
Looks like there's a lot you don't know about her.
So, when's Grandma coming back?
I don't know. Not sure.
You don't have to stay here with us. We're not babies.
[Laughs] Talk to your Auntie Caroline.
Well, Kip is, like, 32 years old.
I don't mind if you stay.
Oh. Thanks, Kip.
What the flip was Grandma doin' at the sand dunes?
She was on a date...with her boyfriend.
Boyfriend?
Hey, you guys want to see my video?
[Chuckles] So, what do you think?
It's pretty cool, I guess.
Oh. Man, I wish I could go back in time. I'd take state.
This is pretty much the worst video ever made.
Napoleon, like anyone can even know that.
You know what, Napoleon? You can leave.
You guys are retarded.
So, you and Tammy still together?
No.  Not really.
Why is that?
Well...she's jealous. Says I'm livin' too much in '82.
Really?
Well, I dumped her. What about your girlfriend?
Well, things are gettin' pretty serious right now. I mean, we chat online for, like, two hours every day... so I guess you could say things are gettin' pretty serious. I'm just really tryin' to raise a few bucks right now so I can bring her around for a few days.
Yep. Well, what's she look like?
She's uh-- she's got sandy blonde hair. She's, uh, pretty-look-- pretty good-looking face, but... I'm just gettin' really-- just kinda T.O.'d because, I mean, she hasn't even sent me a full body shot yet.
Hey, you know... I got a little project... that we might be able to make a little moola with.
Really?  That sounds pretty good.
Have you ever heard of nylon polymer?
Go for it.
Back in '82, I used to be able to throw a pigskin a quarter mile.
Aare you serious?
I'm dead serious. Watch this.
What the heck are you doing?
That's what I'm talkin' about.
I better go.
How much you want to make a bet I can throw a football over them mountains? Yeah. If coach would've put me in fourth quarter... we'd have been state champions, no doubt. No doubt in my mind. You better believe things would have been different. I'd have gone pro...in a heartbeat. I'd be makin' millions of dollars and... livin' in a... big ol' mansion somewhere. You know, soakin' it up in a hot tub with my soul mate. Kip, I reckon you know a lot about cyberspace. Y-You ever come across anything like time travel?
Easy. I've already looked into it for myself.
Right on. Right on.
Is Pedro here today?
I don't think so.  Why?
Just wondering. Can you, uh, give this to him for me?
Mm-mmm.
Ow. God.
What are you drawing?
A liger.
What's a liger?
It's pretty much my favorite animal. It's like a lion and a tiger mixed. Bred for its skills in magic.
Hmm. [Sighs] Where's your friend?
I don't know. Did you see him today?
No.
Neither did I.
Do you need a ride?
No. I missed the bus today, but my uncle's coming to get me.
Oh.
See ya.
Right. I-- I think just a little bit east of the cementery is a good little area right here. We should do it there. Don't go down here, 'cause they don't have any money.
So, how long are we talkin' about workin'?
What are you-- You're already losing your steam?
No. I just-- I have a chat room meeting at 4:00. I gotta be back here by then.
All right, you just start a little earlier. That's all.
All right.
Or else work afterwards. How long's the chat room?
Geez, sometimes up to three, four hours maybe. Maybe not. I don't know.
You-- You pay the bills for that? Does that cost money every time you're on, like for minutes on the phone?
Yeah. Grandma's still payin' per minute. She gets kind of pissed at me sometimes 'cause I'm on there so long.
I'll bet she does. I'd be throwin' you out the window.
Ow!
What the crap was Uncle Rico doin' over at my girlfriend's house?
Napoleon, let go of me! I think you're bruisin' my neck meat!
Fine. What the heck are you guys doin'? Tryin' to ruin my life and make me look like a friggin' idiot?
I'm out makin' some sweet moola with Uncle Rico. Geez, I think you ripped my mole off.
I did?
Yeah, is it bleeding?
A little bit.
Hey, Kip. I wish you wouldn't look at me like that, Napoleon.
I wish you'd get out of my life and shut up.
I'm gonna tell you somethin' right now. While you're out there playin' patty-cake with your friend Pedro, your Uncle Rico... is makin' 120 bucks.
I could make that much money in five seconds.
Geez. Yeah, right, Napoleon. I made, like, 75 bucks today.
Napoleon, it looks like you don't have a job. So why don't you get out there and feed Tina.
Why don't you go eat a "decroded" piece of crap.
