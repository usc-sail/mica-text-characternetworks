EMPTY_LINE
Thank you for all your questions, but we've run out of... Just then the ground shakes with a frightening RUMBLE. Everyone quiets down -- is it an earthquake?   As the RUMBLE HITS again, the surface of the water in the koi pond ripples, a la Jurassic Park. Reporters look around anxiously as another RUMBLE HITS; Bill's face falls as he sees... 
What's the damage? JEN We're down nine points in the polls. BILL In fifteen minutes? GARY And dropping. BILL It's a disaster. 
I have no idea. I thought he was out of town. TOM Jen, I gave you specific orders to get some handlers and keep Brad locked down until after the announcement. JEN I did! They flew to the ranch in Maui last night! TOM Maui?! Wasn't he at the villa in South Hampton? BILL I thought he was at the chalet in Aspen.
 Nope... It was the compound in Bermuda. TOM Oh for God's sake!   Can't we -- Brad enters and Tom shuts up. BRAD Yo, Pops, that was off the hizzook! I just got you another million votes right dare! 
Bill, you've got to shut this down, now. Tell Brad he can't work with you, period. BILL No, no. I love his enthusiasm... It's just a little misguided. There must be something he can do for the campaign, where he can't hurt us. TOM Such as...? BILL I don't know... phones, stuffing envelopes, making signs, something. CUT TO:
Brad looks on proudly; Tom closes his eyes, a migraine kicking in. CUT TO:
That's old school. Pops, you got to keep your pimp hand strong. CUT TO:
Peep y'all later. I'ma go work on my new campaign rhyme, 'Election Erection.' It's gonna be large! Yo! I'ma start on a new sign. 
Set up an appointment with my shrink. CUT TO:
So... Bradley... BRAD Why you keep callin' me dat? DR. FELDMAN Well that's your name, isn't it?
It's my slave name, a'ight?    I told you like fi'ty times. DR. FELDMAN  Yes, okay... B-Rad... BRAD Wassup? DR. FELDMAN Let's play an association game. He picks up three CD's, keeping the backs to Brad. 
 Dammit, Brad, stop acting like a gang member. You're from Malibu, you live in a nice home... BESS With nice maids! DR. FELDMAN Bill, Bess, go to your happy places. Bill sits back, frustrated. DR. FELDMAN What are your goals, B-Rad?    What do you want out of life? BRAD To be the biggest rapper dere ever was! See, I got something to say, and I need the world to hear it. I'm the shiznit. I'll buy y'all cars! DR. FELDMAN I see. And when did you first start feeling like you were this... shiznit? BRAD Oh, damn... way back in the day. I've had these beats in my head since I was a little shortie... DISSOLVE TO:
Gluckman residence. Brad takes the headphones and pulls them over his ears. GLADYS No, Bill and Bess are out of the country until December.
Finish those vegetables, Bradley. BILL You can't be excused until you do.
Tch.   Forget y'all. REVEAL: on the table across from Brad is a video conference system. Both parents are on separate monitors -- Bess's has a sign that reads, "Paris," and Bill's reads, "Tokyo." There is a place setting in front of each monitor, as if they're dining with him. BILL That's it, mister. BESS When we get home... sometime in the near future... you're going to be in big trouble!! 
What I'm sensing, Brad, is that your parents weren't really there for you. BRAD Nope. BESS  That's ridiculous! BILL What about your bar mitzvah? DISSOLVE TO:
What's the theme of your party, kid? Star Wars? Baseball? Superheroes? REVEAL: THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLD BRAD dressed like Flava Flav, a big clock around his neck, looking like he's just smelled a fart. BRAD It's O.P.P., bitch! Brad exits through French doors, and as we FOLLOW him OUTSIDE NAUGHTY BY NATURE'S "O.P.P." KICKS IN.
Bess, I'm sensing you'd like to share. BESS B-Rad, you're a wonderful son... it's just that, well -- BILL Oh stop beating around the bush, Bess. What we're trying to say is, Brad, that your behavior is, well, it's an embarrassment to the family.
Yo, Pops, that hurts my feelings. BILL I'm sorry, but it's the truth. BRAD Don't be hatin'. BILL And, Brad... I can't have you on the campaign any longer. BRAD What?! Oh that's how it is? A'ight then. I'm Audi! I need to take a drive. 
Bradley, I know you're busy, but we need to talk. Brad lifts his sunglasses and turns to his mother. BRAD What's up? BESS After our therapy session I realized that your father and I could have been better parents. We neglected you and I feel terrible. 
MALIBU'S MOST WANTED - Rev. 8/22/02 A15   CONTINUED:                                                        A15 BRAD For real? BESS Yes.  So from here on out I'm going to be a better mother. I want to get closer to you... be there for you. If ever you need -- Just then, her CELL PHONE RINGS.         She pulls it out from her hip and answers. BESS Hello? Celeste! When did you get back?! What?! Oh my God! I've been waiting for that bag for six months! (to Brad, covering phone) It's my personal shopper.  Stay right there. I'm on my way! She stands. BESS So... where we... Oh yes. I'm always here for you, Bradley. Do you have my cell number? She hands Brad a piece of paper and exits. Brad pulls down his shades and takes a long sip from his forty.
Gladys? GLADYS Yeah? BRAD Ever feel like you don't belong? 
It'll be perfectly safe. BILL How does it work? JEN We hire actors to play gangsters. TOM They car-jack Brad,     then take him on a 'tour' of the     'hood... give him a little taste     of what thug life's really like.      It might just scare the black out     of him. 
I don't know... it sounds so drastic. TOM Maybe drastic is what Brad needs, Bill. He is twenty-four. I mean, what's he gonna do for a living, rap? They all chuckle.     Bill sighs. BILL Who do we get for the gangsters? TOM Remember the anti-crime spot we shot last month? GARY We've got it cued up. They turn to the TV and Gary hits PLAY. On the monitor:     A Gluckman campaign ad plays.
For too long, street violence has torn Californians apart... A second banger , glares at camera. 
I guess we never thought of each other like that. PJ Me neither, dawg. PJ and Sean think is over, nod and shake hands. BILL You see...  'California is my family'... Cut to angle on Bill and the gangbangers playing basketball, having a wonderful time. BILL If we work together as a family there's no telling how high we can go.
TOM Those are our guys, right there. BILL Will he be safe? 
Lemme go. MOCHA You don't want to see him like dis. BRAD What happened? MOCHA He O.D.'d again.
Why didn't you stop him? MONSTER I tried, yo! BRAD How many did he do? MOCHA Like twelve, thirteen, I don't know! BRAD Damn. Twelve Frapachizzo's. Brotha's caffeined out. Move aside. 
Oh, Mr. Amiraslani. I'm so glad you came back. Our clerk accidentally gave you the wrong aromatherapy candles. Here you go. She hands Hadji a box marked "Lilac." BRAD You better be validatin' my parking? OLD WOMAN Of course, sir. BRAD Dat's what I'm talkin' 'bout.    We get ours! CUT TO:
 Hold the phone, buddy... you want us to scare this kid until he starts acting like a nice little white boy again? TOM Don't think you can handle it? 
Okay, so here's the story -- it's your basic kidnapping... SEAN So we hold him for ransom? TOM Right.   But when you see   him acting ghetto and all, it    pisses you off  so much, you tour   him around the 'hood to show    him what things are really like.  I had my guys brainstorm    a few ideas... 
We can handle ourselves. Come on, man, it's the ultimate acting challenge. SEAN You know what really chaps  my ass? After years of training and  study, the only parts they'll give  us are gangbangers. Just once I'd   like to play a character who has  decent grammar and doesn't wear Timberlands. PJ Beats gettin' dunked on by Bill Gluckman. SEAN Do we even know anybody down there? They think, then come up with it at the same time. PJ My cousin. SEAN Shondra. CUT TO: SHONDRA - DAY in a Wienie In a Bun uniform, chewing gum and looking like she's smelling something nasty. 
SEAN Honest to God. SHONDRA That's the stupidest thing I ever heard. I got better things to do with my time, boy. SEAN Like work at Wienie In A Bun? PJ Really. You're the one always talkin' about improvin' yourself. SHONDRA I am improvin' myself, fool. I broke up with no-good gang-bangin' Tec, I'm going to beauty school, then I'ma hook up my own salon... PJ In the meantime, how about hooking a brother up with a Pepsi and some fries? SHONDRA Shut up, stupid. SEAN Do this, Shondra. You'll get some real money so you can quit this minimum wage crap and start up your business. SHONDRA What you payin'? SEAN A grand. SHONDRA Make it trey, we on. 
We're strapped now, my brother. He sets the box down and begins pulling out guns. SEAN They have everything we ordered?
Glocks, Uzis, Tec-9s... PJ takes off the cap to wipe his brow, revealing that his hair has been braided into cornrows. SEAN What the hell is that? PJ Oh, my hair? Shondra just did it.  What? You hate it? SEAN No. I just think it's a choice my character would have made. PJ Don't go there, Sean. You're just jealous you didn't think of it first. SEAN Whatever. DISSOLVE TO:
DISSOLVE TO:
Add a 'beeyotch' and I think you're there. MUSIC: the MUSIC SEGUES from our MONTAGE RAP BEAT TO Mocha's HUMAN BEAT BOX, as we... DISSOLVE TO:
I'm thin to win!  'The name is B-Rad, Not Robbie Van Winkle... Go get my latte nonfat, And don't forget the sprinkle!' They pound and congratulate Brad on his      brilliance. Shondra drops her shades back down and      moves in. Hadji sees her first. His jaw drops, then he       tugs on Mocha's shirt, whose jaw drops, then Mocha tugs      on Brad's shirt. BRAD Yo, what up, fool?   I'm -- 
Can I help you? SHONDRA Coffee. BARISTA Tall, Grande, Venti, nonfat, soy -- SHONDRA Big...  ...black. BRAD  Yo, Krista the Barista. Put it on my account.  Get yourself a blueberry scizonne too, girl. SHONDRA Cool, playa. She smiles.     Brad follows her over to the condiment table. 
... the Palaside Pimps. SHONDRA Damn.   How do you deal? BRAD All day every day. She smiles seductively. SHONDRA Was that you droppin' rhymes when I came in? 
Sounds just like that fat fool. I'll talk to him 'bout it. BRAD  Hold dup? You know Big Boy? SHONDRA Hell yeah. I see him at the swap meet almost every Sunday. BRAD For rizzill?! SHONDRA For rizzeal. BRAD Yo.    Holler at him for me.
I don't know. I guess you do kinda got it goin' on... It's funny. I was just on my way down to see him. Wanna roll with me? BRAD Now?  Well, tonight was my Seder dinner... SHONDRA Just helping out a brotha. 
Shut up! BRAD I ain't lyin'! They pound, shake, hug. HADJI Yo, but what about us? BRAD Start droppin' beats. Soon as I sign with Biggy, we gonna need some sick tracks. HADJI Bet! They all pound as Mocha starts throwing beats.
It's on. CUT TO:
So what do you rap about? 
Gimme yo ride, punk, or I will dust yo ass... beeyotch! BRAD What?! SEAN You're gettin' jacked!   Move! BRAD Shondra?! SHONDRA Shut up, fool!

Your momma's so poor, when she shops at Barneys, she has to drive herself! MOCHA Oooh! MONSTER Yeah? Well your momma's so poor, when she went to Monte Carlo, she flew commercial. MOCHA Dang! HADJI Your momma's so poor, her round the world cruise ended in Spain! MOCHA Bam! MONSTER Your momma's so poor, when she stayed at the Four Seasons, she could only afford three. 
PJ Let's get him inside.
Dang. Why you doin' this to a brother? SEAN A brother? PJ Oh no you didn't. SEAN Whose brother? BRAD Yours, y'all.    I'm down. SEAN Down?    God damn! PJ Uh-oh.    You done did it now. SEAN You are not black! You can never be black. And your perpetratin' ass is stealin' the only thing I got -- my culture! PJ What the hell makes you think you know what's goin' down in the 'hood?! BRAD B.E.T. 
27     OMITTED                                                       27 thru                                                                 thru A34                                                                  A34
You got anything else on you, fool? 
We gonna go call yo daddy. SEAN You better pray he home. If he not, you're one dusted trick! Sean, PJ and Shondra exit, slamming the door behind them.
Did you buy my rage? PJ You're indicating. SEAN I'm indicating? 
Sure, Shondra, sorry. You're on. Go play good cop. We've gotta call Tom. Shondra rolls her eyes and heads back into the room.
You a'ight in here? BRAD Oh yeah. I just been kidnapped, carjacked, hands tied behind my back, but other than that, it's all good.
Look, I'm sorry about all that, it wasn't my idea. BRAD I thought you liked me. SHONDRA I do. BRAD Then how come you set me up? SHONDRA I had to. They...  ... they threatened to kill me if I didn't play along. 
A'ight, we put the call in to yo pops, and you know what he said? BRAD Huh? PJ That he'd have to think about it. BRAD  What?   Straight up? PJ He's not sure he wants you back, cuz. SEAN Can't see as I blame him. BRAD Come on, y'all, quit hatin'.   I'm just a rapper, that's it. SEAN Wigga please! Sean cuts the duct tape with a blade. SEAN Come on. 
SEAN A'ight, Malibu, go get us six 40s of O.E. PJ And a fifth of Henny.  Anything else? BRAD I'd like some Pringles.
This ain't a picnic, bitch! BRAD I'm sorry, I'm sorry... y'all got some duckets, 'cause I'm tapped. SEAN You about to go up in there and give this Korean bitch yo ends? Hell no. PJ You jack that shit. SEAN And if the Asiatic gives you any static, show the brotha this... He hands Brad one of the prop guns -- a Glock.    It's heavier than Brad thought. He drops it. PJ Little trick claims he down, can't even swing a gat. BRAD But... SEAN Do it, punk, or I'll use that on you. BRAD Okay, a'ight, I'll do it. 
This is gonna be classic. SEAN He's gonna run out of there a scared little white boy. They laugh again and pound it. CUT TO:
KOREAN GUY Yes? BRAD Yeah, uh, where the Old English at? KOREAN GUY Back there, under security camera. BRAD Thank you, sir. Brad hurries to the back of the store, and spots a door by the beer cooler. He tries to open it. It's locked. Brad looks up to the security mirror and sees that the Korean Guy is watching him. He moves to the beer cooler and tries to calm down. 
How much did you have to give this guy, anyway? PJ What are you talking about? SEAN  When you set this thing up yesterday, what did you pay? PJ I thought you set it up.
You mean the owner doesn't know this is all fake? PJ Oh damn. SEAN Get in there!    He could get shot! PJ I'm not going in there!    You go in there! They continue to argue as we... CUT TO:
My emergency stash.    Thank you God. He pulls out a hundred and kisses it. KOREAN GUY  Glad you got cash, 'cause if you try to jack me, I was gonna have to lay you out wid dis... 
That's right! Next time I'll bust a cap in yo trick ass! PJ Did he actually do it? SEAN This can't be happening. 
Straight up.   Trick didn't do nothin'. PJ Yo, what up with this? PJ pulls the receipt off of his 40. PJ If you jacked this, how come you got a receipt? Brad freezes.     They both stare at him. BRAD I stole that too! CUT TO:
Smooth... he's in South Central. BILL And he's okay? TOM He's in excellent hands. CUT TO:
SEAN I've about had it, boy! BRAD Who you callin' boy? SEAN You got about five seconds to get real, or I'ma Timbo stomp your ass to de curb! BRAD What do you mean, get real?! SEAN Act your white self! He shoves a prop gun into Brad's ribs. SEAN Five!   Four! 
You buying it? SEAN I can't tell. PJ Me either. SEAN Let's give him the test. CUT TO:
 You a'ight, man? Brad snaps out of it for a minute. BRAD  Great, fine. Terrific popcorn. SCARY MUSIC    KICKS IN; Brad's eyes snap back to the screen. He     struggles to contain himself. The MUSIC INTENSIFIES,    we hear FOOTSTEPS, then a DOOR HANDLE TURNING, and    Brad can't hold on any longer. He leaps up, screaming... 
I'm sorry, y'all, but this is just who I am. I'm a rapper straight- up. SEAN AND PJ Wigga, please! BRAD No, for real. I can rap about anything.  'Bloodbath and Tree, hang all day, They real tight, but they ain't gay... No, they okay...' PJ  You think you got mad skills, huh? Well, we'll see about dat.
I done had it with you, fool. You better check yourself before you wreck yourself. This ain't Malibu! BRAD  Represent. 
This is definitely gonna do it. PJ Pay day! They pound and follow Brad into the club. CUT TO:
How you feelin' now, Malibu?
Finally, a place where I feel at home. PJ  Get yo' ass in there. Brad boldly fist-shakes jaw-dropped patrons as he wades through the crowd, AD LIBBING "Whassup?" and "Pardon me, homey."
DROP finishes and the MC brings up STEEL and YOUNG DRE, announcing the Battle Rap Competition. Steel and Young Dre battle -- both are top-notch. At every insult, the crowd ROARS.
Y'all been busy, huh? SHONDRA Too busy for you. TEC You been gettin' busy? SHONDRA Hell no. TEC Come on, girl, I'm cool.    Just tell me who it is. SHONDRA All you need to know is that it ain't you, okay?
You know, you ain't shit, Shondra. You're just a chickenhead, and that's all you'll ever be. Just then, Brad walks up, grinning like a fool. BRAD What up, girl?! He gives her a sloppy kiss on the cheek. SHONDRA You a'ight? 
Damn, man. Don't you know how to treat a lady? That's not nice. SHONDRA Brad, don't -- TEC It's cool, Shondra.      The brutha's right. Tec releases Shondra's arm and immediately grabs Brad by the throat and hangs him over the balcony. TEC Didn't yo mama teach you to mind you own bizness? BRAD  Don't be hatin'.
Don't do it, Tec! BRAD Auuuuuuuuu! Tec feels everyone looking at him. Now is not the time. He releases Brad and composes himself. TEC Y'all both gonna be sorry. Tec stalks off. SHONDRA You alright? 
Yo! Sean bumps the DJ table. A vicious look from the DJ, as Sean tries to play it off. The MC just looks at him disdainfully. PJ Uh... My boy want Young Dre next. The MC looks them over... MC Hell, nah... SEAN Maybe a C-Note would open some... equal opportunities? MC  What's his name? SEAN B-rad.   From Malibu. The MC makes a face, but puts down Brad's name anyway. PJ  Hey playa... You got any Will Smith back there? The MC just looks at him...
BRAD Damn Shondra, where's the fire at? SHONDRA  You're going home. BRAD You settin' me free? SHONDRA No. I'm savin' your ass. I'm not havin' your blood on my hands.  It's the blue Honda across the street.
Shondra, I gots to do 'dis. this is my shot. I gotta prove myself. Shondra can't argue. Brad starts to the stage. A WAVE OF SHOCK, as the crowd realizes who B-rad actually is. SHONDRA This is gonna be like an episode of 'Oz.' Brad gets his game face on and walks the gauntlet on his way to the stage -- an imposing path of intimidating looks. 
As Young Dre flows, Brad is visibly shaken, but tries to play it off -- not so discreetly scribbling notes on his hand and up his arm. Young Dre finishes with devastating blow, dropping the mic on the stage. The crowd goes wild... MC Whooo... GOD DAMN! Now, let's see if this Eminem melts in yo ass and in your hand. 
PJ  Let's get the hell out of here. Brad looks around as blank faces stare back at him. BRAD I'm sorry... The crowd erupts with outrage and rushes the stage. SMASH CUT TO: 
SEAN What was that? A RUMBLE comes from the dumpster and they pull back the lid. ANGLE ON: Inside the dumpster where Brad lies in the bottom -- his fall was broken by several loaves of old Wonder Bread. PJ and Sean fall into hysterics, as Shondra emerges from the club. She finds PJ and Sean apoplectic with laughter, shakes her head and begins to help Brad out of the dumpster.
You gettin' played, ese. TEC Excuse me? SNUFFY  Loco boy hittin' your lady, homes, and she's diggin' it. TEC Yeah, Snuffy, that's right. 
Hey y'all, check this out. I can rap about anything! Haaa!! PJ Word.  'Listen, all you rappers, the name's Brad Gluckman. When on the mic you could say I really suck man!' They burst out laughing. Brad just stares ahead, pouting, sick to his stomach. SHONDRA A'ight, y'all had your fun, why don't you chill... PJ 'Cuz B-Rad G about to get ill!!! They burst out laughing again as they head for the car. 
He thinks y'all belong down here in the 'hood with us brothas, seein' how you so 'down' and all. PJ So, I guess that means we got to ice your punk ass. BRAD I don't care no more. I got nothin' to live for. Go ahead and smoke me. Brad gets in the car. Sean and PJ look at each other -- this isn't what they expected. CUT TO:
Why you so down, dog? BRAD I'm a failure. RAT Nah, nah it's not like that. You need to stop listening to what all them perpetrators is running and believe in yourself. BRAD For real? RAT For riz-real.    Pound it. They punch it in.
So you saying if I put my mind to it I can be whatever I want to be? RAT Damn straight. BRAD I could be a highstylin' pimp? RAT They stylin-est. BRAD I could drive a mad '63 El Camino with 43-inch gold-plated dubs and a trunk full o' bitches? 
MALIBU'S MOST WANTED - Rev. 1/29/03 A50   CONTINUED:                                                   A50 RAT You could have a roof rack full of bitches. And some teeny-tiny little bitches in the glove compartment. BRAD And I could be the biggest rapper in the world. RAT Rapper? Hell no! You stink! I'd rather eat garbage than listen to your tired ass rhymes.  Hmmm, garbage. That's making me hungry. Peace out. The Rat runs off. Brad sighs, flops back down on the bed, utterly depressed. CUT TO:
Hey...   You okay? Brad sniffles. SHONDRA You know, it's not as bad as it seems. 
But you heard 'em laughing.   I ain't nothin' but a busta. SHONDRA They just don't understand you. None of them know how hardcore it is up in... Malibu. BRAD  Yeah? SHONDRA Yeah with the... traffic, and the... parking, and... BRAD  Like, when the public be all up in your private beach? SHONDRA Right. You just got to stick with it, you know, don't let anyone tell you who you are. Brad smiles, looks at her. BRAD Thanks, Shondra.  You know what I was sayin', earlier, in the car, about being a playa and all? Well... I was just foolin'. I never been with a sister before. 
I offered you a snack, not the whole kitchen. BRAD I'm sorry.   I'm sorry.   I'm chill. She rolls her eyes and leaves. Brad falls back on the bed, a dreamy smile on his face. BRAD Totally chill. CUT TO:
A'ight, that's it, this game is lame. I want my money, and then y'all can get out. PJ But we're not done yet... SHONDRA You ain't never gonna be done. Did it ever occur to you two jackasses that this is the way he really is? SEAN No way. PJ Not possible. SHONDRA Whatever. Look, I did what you asked, and I want my money. SEAN Okay, I'll get it, you know, but settin' everything up was expensive, and I don't exactly have it right now. SHONDRA Excuse me?   You playin' me? Shondra hands Sean the phone. SHONDRA Y'all get me my money now, or I'ma go in there and tell him what's up. SEAN Alright, okay, just relax... As Sean starts to dial, we -- CUT BACK TO:
Yes, Sean. How's our little project going? 
Your suggestions were really helpful. He totally bought the car jack and kidnapping...
... we staged a fabulous liquor store robbery. Mr. Gluckman's going to be very happy... Brad's eyes widen. SEAN But, he's still posing, so we wanted to put him in a drive-by shooting next... but, it's a little more money then our original projections... Brad slumps back.     He can't believe it.
So I was wondering if I could get an advance. TOM No deal. You get the rest when Richie Cunningham steps through the door here, and not one second sooner, understand? SEAN But -- Mr. Gibbons, hello?
Damn... they been playin' me all along. How could dey do dat? How could she do dat?  What-ever. If them fools wanna play, then let's play. He heads for the door, bad-ass and hardcore.
What the hell do you think you're doing? BRAD Hey! Listen up... Brad G is in da hiz, and things gonna start changin' round here! PJ  Do something. SEAN You must be out yo mind. Get back in that room before I beat your ass! BRAD You feelin' froggy, den leap! Sean backs down. BRAD Anyone else wanna step? SHONDRA  What the hell got into you? BRAD Shut up, ho. 
But we got big a problem here. SHONDRA Until I see my money, it's your problem. Sean and PJ exit quickly. CUT TO:
Why you talkin' crazy? BRAD  Might as well go out in a blaze of glory.  My daddy don't love me, my rhymes is played. I ain't down enough for y'all -- SEAN  No.   You down, right PJ, er, Tree? PJ That's right, Bloodbath, he's very down. As down as they come. Suddenly, Tec jumps up, yanks Brad's door open and shoves a Nine in his side.
Oh my God. TEC Get out of the car, white boy. BRAD Oh, you dat weak fuck from de club. Tec can't believe what he's hearing. BRAD  Got somethin' for me? 
What should we do with this Bloodbath and his friends? SEAN  I'm not Bloodbath! My real name is Sean James, I'm an actor. I swear! TEC Is Shondra hittin' the white boy? SEAN No way, man. She's in on the scam, just like us. 
The dawg who's down with bitches and hoes? Hell yeah, I've heard of him. Just 'cause I live down here you think I'm ignorant? PJ We didn't say that, brother. TEC A'ight then.  Damn, we got Gluckman's son. Fool's gotta be worth more alive than dead.  Let's roll. CUT TO:
All the polls say that since Brad's been out of the picture we're up six points. 
Tom, we have a real problem. TOM I told you, no more money. SEAN I know you said that, but we're in real serious troub -- Tec rips the phone out of Sean's hand. TEC Listen, fool. Gluckman's boy has been kidnapped for real, along with your punk friends. TOM Excuse me? 
Help us, please...  I'm...  so...  Scared!!! Sean begins to wail.      Tec yanks the phone back. TOM Okay, I'm convinced. TEC Good.   Now get me my money. TOM Fine... Please don't do anything until I talk to Mr. Gluckman and arrange the finances. TEC You got ten minutes. Tec hangs up. DEUCE Now what? TEC We wait. Behind, no one notices as a low rider cruises by slowly.
Is that him, ese? LOC Yeah, that's Tec, homes, from the I-9's. SNUFFY Call Cyco, tell him to bring it all. We gonna have a party.
What the hell's going on? TOM Brad's been kidnapped for real. BRETT What? TOM They want five hundred grand or they'll kill him. GARY Oh my God. TOM Now let's not panic. Lemme just think this through for a minute. We could have a very interesting opportunity here. BRETT Where are you going with this? TOM Well, the negatives are obvious. 
With a dead son, the sympathy factor could give us big spike in the female and gay demos. BRETT We've had such a problem with Bill's rich guy image, we could spin the issue to make him more 'Everymen,' you know, 'crime touches everyone,' like that. TOM What about a voter backlash, like how could he run on the heels of a tragedy? GARY No -- we push the 'courage under adversity' angle. BRETT Helps with his leadership profile. JEN Bill Gluckman, crusader/martyr... BRETT I've got the image -- Bill weeping over Brad's open casket. GARY Then, after grieving appropriately, he goes on the offensive... 
It's just what we've needed. BRETT It's like a green light to Sacramento. TOM Next stop, the White House. The PHONE RINGS and Tom picks up. INTERCUT WITH:
What up? TOM No deal. TEC Say what? TOM Bill Gluckman does not make deals with criminals. TEC That's it, then, fool. I ain't playin'. His ass is done. 
That's cold.  Lose the tape. Tec's homie rips the tape off Brad's mouth. BRAD God damn that hurts!!! I get out of this I'ma hafta teach y'all some manners! TEC Your daddy ain't payin'. BRAD Yeah, yeah, tell me somethin' I don't know! TEC What?
You heard me, you half-steppin' moist-ass bitch! Tec cocks his nine and aims at Brad. BRAD  Oh what, you gonna do me like this? A'ight, then bring it. TEC It's brought. BRAD Man up! Put this wannabe out of his misery. 
Snuffy and three Rollin' G's are crouched behind their low rider, FIRING away.
The I-9s RETURN FIRE. PJ and Sean are in the fetal position, freaking out. Brad, thinking it's all fake, is laughing, having a great time. TEC Lay down some cover, fool! Tec's pinned down behind the dumpster. He's without a weapon, and Rollin' G's are FOCUSING their FIRE on him. 8-BALL We're tryin', man, but they're too strapped. DEUCE What the hell we gonna do? BRAD Punks.   Gimme dem gats. Brad grabs the Uzis and rolls out from under the car. 
It's safe now, y'all. Tec emerges from behind the dumpster. The crew rolls out from under the car, followed by Sean and PJ. They look at Brad in awe. They're impressed. TEC That was ill!    Y'all definitely got juice. He offers his fist to Brad.        They pound. TEC Where'd you learn that shit? BRAD Damn.   Jus' MTV.

Bradley's been involved in a gang shooting. TOM Are you positive? BILL His face was on the news, Tom!   I think I know my own son! TOM I'm sure there's a logical explanation. Why don't you get some sleep -- BILL Sleep? He's shooting the hell out of South Central. We've got to get him! TOM What about the debate tomorrow in Sacramento -- BILL Forget the debate! TOM If you cancel, you can kiss this campaign good-bye. 
This is Lojack. BILL I need a location on license number...  'D-SHIZNIT.' HUMAN OPERATOR That vehicle is at the corner of McKinley and 82nd.
TEC That's yours, B. BRAD For real?   You shouldn't have. TEC Welcome to the 9's.     Only way out now, is in a box. BRAD In a box... right. Brad laughs.   They all join in, laughing hard as we -- CUT TO:
A'ight, Monster, what kind of toast you strappin'? MONSTER  This. Monster pulls a scuba divers' spear gun from the bag. HADJI What the hell is it? MONSTER My pop's spear gat. From the yacht. Mocha laughs and starts doing whale sounds. MONSTER A'ight Free Willy, think you so bad, what you got? 
Shut up!   Damn posers! He snatches the musket from Monster and carefully places it back in the case. MONSTER Hadji, how 'bout you? HADJI Couldn't get much, yo... Hadji opens a duffel and pulls out three Kevlar vests. HADJI When I told my pops we was going on a drive-by, he gave me three of these. 
 Christmas present from Uncle Ahmet. CUT TO:
Yes, Mr. Amiraslani, can I help you? HADJI Hell yes, chicken. I need a location on license number D- SHIZNIT. CUT TO:
BRAD Yeah, I just got tested positive ... for G.A.M.E. SISTER #1  Cool playa. SISTER #2 Let's get busy. They laugh when suddenly Shondra comes through the door.
That's the same damn line he used on me, and now this no good deadbeat weak-ass white boy won't take care of little Malik. BRAD What?! SHONDRA  You know he's yours... SISTER #1 This gettin' heavy. 
For the money. BRAD What you need money Money?!   Tch. for? SHONDRA Look, fool, this may sound stupid to you, but not everybody has money, and to people that don't, money is important! BRAD Please. You prob'ly still flippin' me anyway, so -- 
Who's the hell's poppin' ca --
Shondra, on her knees, kneeling before Brad.
TEC  What up, cuz? Shondra stands quickly, scared. BRAD (terrified, covering) Ha ha, Tec, my road dawg, yeah, just the man I wanta see. TEC  What's goin' on, Shondra? SHONDRA  It's not what it looks like, Tec, I swear. TEC Don't you lie to me. That was always my line to you, and it always was what it looked like. Now what's up with your boyfriend here. 
Wait, Tec, lemme explain, 'cause I don't belong here... TEC You done forgot already, fool? I told you the only one way out of the I-9s, and your 'E' ticket's in this here chamber. Tec cocks his gun. 
Please, don't be hatin'. Shondra steps in front of Brad. SHONDRA I won't let you do it, Tec. TEC No problem, then.   I'll just do the both of you. Tec levels the barrel at Shondra and Brad. He starts to squeeze the trigger when suddenly Bill's HUMMER CRASHES through the wall. I-9's scatter and duck as the Hummer's front grill skids to a stop inches from Tec. The driver's door pops open and Bill jumps out.
Damn fool!   You just hit my house! BILL  Brad!   Are you okay? BRAD Not really. And unless you seriously strapped, you about to be not really okay too. Bill turns:     six I-9s are aiming guns at he and Brad. BILL Hey there, fellas. Bill Gluckman... I'm running for governor. 
I didn't know anything about that. You've got to believe me, that was not part of the plan. BRAD What was the plan? Send me down here to scare me white? BILL It was stupid, I know. I thought I'd tried everything... I just didn't know how to deal with you anymore. BRAD You've never known how to deal with me 'cause you don't know me, and you never cared to find out. And now that your election's on the line, that's when you take a stand? That's bullshit, Pops. Look at me, 'cause this is who I am, and if you can't accept that, then I'll walk out that door, never see your sorry-ass again. Shondra, Tec, all the I-9's and Brad's posse slowly turn from Brad to Bill, completely caught in the moment, waiting for his response. BILL I'm not proud of myself, Brad. I made a lot of mistakes, and I know I wasn't there for you, and I can't change that, but I always loved you and still do...  
 No doubt. He's raising his kid. 8-BALL (dialing his cell, wiping tears) I'ma call my pops right now. TEC Would y'all get a hold of your fool selves?! It's time to waste these punks! The I-9s straighten up and re-aim their guns. 
The HOUSE BLOWS in a huge orange FIREBALL... DISSOLVE TO:
I know my rights, man, and these fools drove two damn cars into my house, then they blew the shit up! This all better be rebuilt before my ma comes back, or she will make you wish you were never born. CLOSE ON a FEMALE TV REPORTER speaking TO CAMERA. REPORTER I have two witnesses who were at the scene of the explosion... She turns and the CAMERA WIDENS to include Sean and PJ; their clothes are singed and still smoking. REPORTER Can you tell us what happened? 
I can deal with a little more of that reality. They kiss again, then Brad breaks it. BRAD Wait a minute. You said two things was real. What was the other? Shondra smiles as we... SLAM TO: 91   CLOSEUP ON BIG BOY                                              91 BIG BOY What up, Shondra?

I need you to help me get the urban vote. Introduce me. BRAD Dang, I'd be honored. BILL And, son, don't say it...  Rap it. BRAD  For real, Pops? 
We all gather here on this special occasion. To listen to my pops, he's your west coast liaison. A speech from him, dude, is like sex with a hoochi. It's hot and excitin', like shoppin' at Gucci! Asians, Jews, Mexicans, too. Everybody's votin', yo, it's a cultural stew. Once he's in office you'll experience great riches. As a thank you for helpin', you can get wit my bitches! Let's get Glucked! Y'all get Glucked! We get Glucked! Come on everybody put your hands up! Bill moves onstage and attempts to dance hip hop style. BRAD Immigration, education, and runaway inflation.

We CRANE DOWN FROM a sign that reads: "GRAND OPENING, SHONDRA'S NAIL AND BEAUTY SALON" to reveal a crowd of Malibu women gathered around Brad and Shondra as Shondra cuts a ribbon with a huge pair of scissors; the women rush inside. BRAD I helped Shondra open up her salon right here in the 'Bu.
She styled up all the ladies in Malibu so they were stone-cold ghetto fabulous. Shondra spins the chair to REVEAL: BEES GLUCKMAN with a crazy ghetto hairstyle. She looks like Busta Rhymes. She checks herself in the mirror. BESS I love it.  Boo-ya! She smiles revealing a GOLD TOOTH with a DIAMOND in it.
BILL This is a monumental day for our glorious state and there are several people I need to thank here tonight...  There's the International Brotherhood of Police Officers... APPLAUSE, as POLICE OFFICERS salute Bill. BILL The Southern California Rotary Club... A table full of well-dressed PROFESSIONALS wave politely.
And our friends at the Environmental Defense Fund... A group of granola-type ENVIRONMENTALISTS smile. Brad CLEARS HIS THROAT, causing Bill to look at him. Brad gives Bill a "reminder" nod... BILL Oh, and of course... PULL BACK TO REVEAL:     We're actually in the PROUD BIRD... BILL  ... all the Bitches and Ho's... 
West Coast Reprezzizzin'! Bill and Brad hug. HIP HOP MUSIC KICKS IN and the entire       Ballroom turns into one huge dance party. Bill raises the        roof as he meanders into the celebrating crowd.        People of all different races and backgrounds dance       together, all having a blast... Hadji grinds on an ELDERLY CONSTITUENT's ass... she's into it. HADJI I'm totally taxing your ass. 
Would you care for a wiener? Courtesy of Wiener on a Bun. SEAN Or perhaps I can interest you in a head shot? I'm trained in jazz dance, tap, and I can do a Southern accent. Tom enters wearing a "Wiener on a Bun" manager's outfit. TOM Idiots. What did I tell you about bothering the guests? Now move it, those wieners aren't serving themselves. He pushes them out of there. BRAD Yo, yo, yo... Everyone turns to see Brad still at the podium. Confusion... BRAD Last time I was here, y'all threw my ass out. But now that I haves yo attention, I gots somethin' I gotta say... And I have to do it the only way I know how... Kick it, Moch.
