Hi this is Charlie and... Come on, say your name.
Peggy Sue.
And we're here on the couch...
Don't say that...
We're here on the sofa bed...
Charlie...
...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
But you love me don't you?
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
And nothing will ever change that.
Boy, have they changed. Who gets it?
I don't know, just put it back.
Oh, gotta go. Here's a little makeout music.
Goddamnit, I just can't hit those high notes anymore.
You know Charlie, if you're serious about this, I know a great vocal coach.
Hi Dad, can I have 100 dollars for a brake job?
Did I hear 70 dollars? What do you need 50 dollars for? How's your Mom?
Coming through.
Frank, watch the clock.
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
That stays.
You got a Tab?
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
I know. Put Scott through college.
I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
I'm not going.
Come on Dad!
Be right there. I'll go through the rest of this stuff next weekend.
Bye Mom.
Bye sweetheart.
 I never thought it would go this far.
If the pastries aren't here by nine thirty, call Monica and threaten her life.
I'll be back by noon.
Hi Monica. You just missed Mom.
Sorry I'm late. My Bobo's back in town.
Hi. I'm Dolores Dodge. We're taking calls today on surrogate mothers. Wombs for rent. I want to know how you feel..
Oh, Dolores.
Carol!
Peggy Sue!
I haven't seen you in years. In all that time, haven't you at least tried another hair style?
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
How do you like my hair?
It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
Who's the mother around here?
Sometimes I wonder.
Here Charlie, extra fortune cookies. Good luck.
Thanks.
 Next week you'll be selling Sanyo remote control VCRs for three hundred and ninetynine dollars? Oh no!  Crazy Charlie...
You'll give away Mitsubishi giant screen TVs for twelve hundred and ninetyfive dollars! Oh no! I'll go broke!  Crazy Charlie...
You won't be undersold on stereos, videos, microwaves or blenders!  Crazy Charlie, Crazy Charlie, I'm not breaking cookies, I'm smashing prices. (rolling his eyes like Fabian) Crazy Charlie, he insane.
Turn that off.
When are you going to stop being so mad at Dad? How do you think that makes me feel?
I have a lot of unresolved feelings about him. I don't trust him. Besides, I hate those commercials.
I'm sorry I asked. We don't have time for another heartto heart. Here, try on the dress.
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
You two look like that soap commercial. Which one's the daughter and which one's the mother?
You took this seriously. You're a real blast from the past.
It was Beth's idea.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
You always were a crazy little gal, Peg.
Arthur, please don't call me Peg.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
It must run in the family.
What does?
You and your mother both seem to fall for musicians.
Hey, there's Terry and Leon.
Peggy, would you find a table? We'll see you in a little while.
Okay.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
You look exactly the same.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
It's adorable.
Oh, I'm sorry.. Peggy Sue Kelcher, my wife Sharon.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
Mr. Norvik.
Or, uhh, Richard?  David Snell, Merrill Lynch.  I read about the Cordex deal in Business Week. Congratulations.
Thank you, Doug.
Hi Peggy. How are you? How's Char1ie?
 I can't believe how she let herself go. She was so beautiful in high school.
Everyone's got a gold Rolex. I had this one specially made in platinum.
...fifth generation core capacities are going to cause another shakeout in the smaller companies.
 Your damn computers put me out of business. You're a billionaire, and I'm a goddamn failure.
 Welcome to the singles scene.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Wouldn't we all.
Madeline Hutton and Arthur Nagle were high school sweethearts. Married right after graduation, they're still together. In this day and age, that's remarkable... Maddy, Arthur, how does it feel to have missed the sexual revolution?
 What kind of question is that? It has nothing to do with the reunion.
 I'm glad you asked, Dolores. Four years ago Maddy and I found Jesus...
Spiritual renewal.. That's what reunions are all about. Familiar faces, forgotten memories, ancient dance steps and music...the great time machine.
I never could keep up with you.
 Just call me Walter the dancing dentist. Taps and caps. My specialty.
I remember that dress.
Rosalie Testa!
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
You have an incredible memory.
It's beautiful. Does it open?
Yes. These are my children. But they're not babies anymore.
 I think you got married when you were three.
Carol Pritchard Heath and Walter Getz were high school steadies who went their separate ways. After twenty years and four divorces between them, they meet again Walter a successful dentist, Carol a mature career woman. Carol, why did you really come back for this reunion?
Curiosity mostly. I heard you finally found a man of your own. Too bad he's married.
 Whoa! Cat fight! Purse war!
Hello everyone. Richard Norvik? I'm Dolores Dodge with KARP Radio. Could I have a minute of your time?
Sure. I remember you.
Let's play "Rate the Moment". I give tonight an eightyseven. Better than sex, not as good as racquetball.
The best thing about being a dentist. Pure pharmaceutical grade. A couple of lines of this, I can drill my own teeth... (looks at her for a moment) Hi.
Hi.
 Joe would have enjoyed this. God, I still miss him.
 Peggy was a mess right after they separated, but I think she's coming out of it... It seems to be pretty friendly now..
Sometimes it's easier when you hate them.
Doesn't it feel like it was yesterday?
Youth is like an amputated leg. Long after it's gone, you still feel it.
My husband's a pig. But my son's in social work and my daughter, God bless her, is in India with Mother Teresa.
For the fitness generation, we've sure got a lot of porkers.
I don't remember anything about the seventies.
Breaking up was horrible. I said we had a very special attachment, he said, so does a Hoover.
I don't know why I came back. I hated high school.
I enjoyed it.
Who's the one with the hair?
Michael Fitzsimmons. I had such a crush on him.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz    can still dance.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Who knows. Remember...  Whatever Walter wants...
Sharon Norvik this is Carol Heath, and Maddy Nagle. My oldest and dearest friends. Sharon's married to Richard.
Lucky lady. Hi.
 Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
No. I asked Rosalie. She couldn't track him down.
Too bad.
He must have been quite a guy.
He was the only one in high school I wished I'd gone to bed with.
The only one?
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
Peggy, would you please rescue Richard? Ask him to dance.
Are we through Dolores? Good.
Well...
 You'll be okay?
Yes. You go ahead.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
What was?
Dancing with you.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
Here comes the life of the party.
I knew you couldn't stay away.
You know, they could've at least asked us to sing. We'd refuse, of course, but they could've asked us.
 Hello. Can I have your attention, please.
I know it's getting kind of late, and some of you have a long drive home, so the reunion committee decided it was time for the moment you've all been waiting for. You don't know what you've been waiting for because we didn't tell you, but the committee has selected a King and Queen. Now don't worry, I took care of it so the band's gonna keep playing for at least another hour, and my old pal Judge Crystal said that the bar can stay open as long as we want.
And while you're at it, let's have a nice big hand for the Little Lady that did such a great job supervising all the decorations, Rosalie Testa.
Now back to business. The members of the committee have given this a lot of thought and decided on the two people who best represent the spirit of Buchanan High's Class of '60. The king is someone who, in more ways than one, has come a long, long way since he left here.
We're proud to welcome him back, Richard Norvik! Come on up here, King Richard!
 I demand a recount. 
Sharon and I thank you all for making us feel so welcome. It's good to be back.
Every king deserves a queen. Now, we had a Lot at worthwhile candidates. And I don't want any of you ladies to feel left out, 'cause you're all beautiful. But when we sent out the invitations, we didn't mention anything about this being a costume party.
Maybe we should have, 'cause just looking at her brings it all back for us. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you our queen, Peggy Sue Kelcher Bodell. Come on up here, Peggy Sue.
They're waiting. Come on.
 I can't. It's all too much.
Go on. You can do it.
 Thank you.. Thank you very much.
Would you like your Twinkie now?
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
Charlie! Am I dead?
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
Young man, stop that.
Hey! I just made a deposit in your blood bank. Now I want to make a withdrawal.
I think it's time for your next class -
I'm changing banks!
Lie back down and take a deep breath.
What's going on? Where am I?
You passed out for a moment. Nothing to worry about.
How did I get here?
Why don't you let your friends help you?  Take her into the washroom and splash some cold water on her face. That should perk her up.
Yes, ma' am.
 Wanna smoke?
No thanks. I gave them up years ago.
Where is it?
Were taking you back to the nurse.
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
We're going to take you home.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
I'll call you Later.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
Who is it?
Peggy.  Peggy Sue.
Come on in. It's open.
 Mom!
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
I have a note.
How do you feel?
I'm excused.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Mom!
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
I'm home now.
Okay, I'm alone now. Is anyone here?
No. This is crazy. Is somebody going to tell me what's going on? Why me? What happened? You don't have to show up. I don't have to see you. Just send me a sign.  Thanks a lot. 1 guess I'm on my own.
Nancy! Come here.
What are you doing?
I'm just happy to see you.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
 Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
Don't eat the red ones.
Why not? They're my favorite.
They're bad for you. They cause...red lips.
Can't hurt. I'm already dead.
Peggy Sue! Hurry up. Fabian!
 I put your laundry on your beds. Don't forget to put it away.
What's for dinner?
Meatloaf.
Yeech, not again.
Girls? Evelyn? Who left this thing outside?
What is it?
What do you think?
 Oh, Jack.
Like wow! Wait till I tell Diane. She's always bragging about her father's Cadillac.
Peggy Sue, what do you think?
Oh, Daddy. You were always doing things like that.  That's funny! That's really funny.
Young lady, you're drunk!
 Just a little. I've had a tough day.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
 Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
Evelyn, put her to bed.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
Let's get physical!... Let's get metaphysical!
Good morning.
Can I borrow this sweater?
Yeah, but take good care of it.    I'm saving it for my daughter.. She loves this stuff.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
Oh. I forgot.
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
That would be impossible.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
When did you start drinking coffee?
Oh.    Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
I think I'm way ahead of them.
Pass the toast, please.
And the butter.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
Well, at least you stopped calling me DaddyO.
 DADDYo.
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?
How does Diane like her braces?
She hates them. Nobody likes braces. Thy just call you junkyard face and Miss Metal Mouth. I gotta go.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Sort of.
What about?
The house payments.
How do you feel?
Pretty strange.
Come on. Get in. I can take care of that.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
You drive like a maniac!
I call this the staccato. 
 Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
Oh yeah?
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Refresh my memory.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Maybe I blocked it out.
I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Why wait?
 Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
They'll learn to live with it.
You're more shook up than you want to admit. You'll get used to it, we'll still see each other 2, 3 times a week.
Want me to drive you home later?
Would you?
 Would I?!! Why I oughta...
Good morning, students. This is Mr. Mosey. Our girls diving team is competing today in the county finals at Commander Beck High School. We know they'll put forth a splendid effort  so let's wish them luck.
Where's Rosalie Testa?
Probably at the diving meet.
Finally, congratulations go to Richard Norvik for placing first in the Statewide Math Contest. We're proud of you, Richard....That's all, students.
Did you study for the test?
 Test?
All right, class. Time's up.
What's the meaning of this, Peggy Sue?
 Mr. Snelgrove, I happen to know that in the future, I will never have the slightest use for algebra. And I speak from experience.
Santiago comes back, with nothing there's no meat on the bone. It's Hemingway's ego defending itself again; he's trying to prove he can still perform.
...What Hemingway's saying, Michael, is that we are alone that when we go out too far we're vulnerable. The irony, that Santiago is beaten by the sharks, doesn't make him less of a hero.
Over the weekend read the first four chapters of The Great Gatsbv. I hope you enjoy it.
Mr. Gilfond, can I talk to you?
Sure, Peggy Sue. What's on your mind?
I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoy your class. You taught me a lot and... you're a very fine teacher.
That's very kind of you. Thank you.
Thank you. Um, I also think you're underpaid.
Why does your father take inventory on Sunday night? That's poker night. You always got out of it before.
I've got to string him along for a while. It's for his own good.
But you're not going into his business. When're you going to tell him?
Soon. I can't tall everybody everything all at once.
Strange rumors are sweeping the school about you.
 What do you mean?
Prom what I hear, you really gave it to old Smellgrove.
I was there. She told the creep off right to his face.
Atta girl, Peg.
Arthur, please don't call me Peg.
Why I oughta...
I don't get it.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
It's some stupid old movie thing they just started.
That's enough out of you, little lady.
I'll throw the book at you!
Why I oughta...
I'll be right back.
She's not wasting any time. Peggy Sue and Mr. Square Root?
He's a nice guy. You know he's writing a book?
Oh, a book... Excuse me for a second. 
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
It really wasn't that difficult.
What're you doing, Peggy Sue? Fishing for foureyed worms?
Get lost you macho shmuck.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
Therefore, the key to a successful children's party can be summed up in one word  planning.. With proper planning, a successful, inexpensive happy birthday party can be had by all. Including the mother.
That was very comprehensive, Madeline. Thank you.. Now...  Peggy Sue, your topic was 'How To Choose A Nursery School.' Are you prepared?
All.... Okay. Sure.
Choosing a good nursery school can be one of the most important decisions you can make. It will often determine your child's attitude towards education and schooling.  Of course, the lessons learned are primarily social  sharing, being considerate of others.  And they're so cute when they're little. They bring you back their Little masterpieces every day and you put 'em on the refrigerator door. They're so proud, and their names are all misspelled. Scott would always print his S backwards, and Beth would make her sweet little flowers...
 What a girl. What a twirl. You know, PegLeggy, you're gonna get demoted to hall monitor -
Come on, Peggy Sue.. Try it again. You haven't been practicing.
Looking good out there.
Thanks.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Yeah. Like that.
Good.
What a great kite.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
Are you doing some kind of science project?
Sort of.
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
What's that?
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
I    know what a burrito is.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
What's inside?
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
Okay. I promise.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
No. Really. You're the smartest person I know. It sounds unbelievable. But I can prove it.
Oh yeah?
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
How, did you know about my grandfather?
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
I don't know.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
You're giving me the creeps.
Am I dead or not?
There's one way to find out.
What're you doing?
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
Step in front of the truck! If you're dead, it won't matter. The truck'll go right through you. Go ahead! You're dead!
No! I don't want to die!
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
Einstein said "God doesn't play dice with the universe." I'm a scientist. I believe that there's an order to things. Why would God bring you back as a high school girl?
I don't know.
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
What if you're not here tomorrow?
This necklace is sapphire, it was my Grandmother's.
Who was that man?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
Would you get that, dear?
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
 It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
Peggy Sue! What is it?
What happened to you?
I had a dream that Grandma died.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
What do you mean?
Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.
Hello, Charlie.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
You may have noticed that Peggy Sue's been acting a little strange lately.
She's distorted.
Yes, sir.
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
She's almost a juvenile delinquent.
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
Yes, sir. Trust is a twoway street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.
 Oh, Beth.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
For what?
Maddy's party.
I don't feel very festive.
You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
Enjoy yourself! This is the best time of your life. And the sooner you learn to handle Charlie the better. Get dressed.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
What would that be, sir?
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
 Of course.
Where did you get that sweater?
Great, isn't it?
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
Right. I promised my mother.
Is this slow enough for you?
 Charlie, how are you?
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
It's great. I cleaned the car, do you like it? Oh, I got tickets for Fabian on your birthday, you like him, right? He's cool. Eighteen is half of thirty six. It's "Gentlemen start your engines", vroom, like I'm gassed up ready for the race. I've got the girl, I've got the car, I've got the talent, but I don't know. Do I date, get married, join the army, cut a record, go to college? I got a million choices, but nobody teaches you how to choose. But it's different for a girl. You're Lucky. You just have to wait for me.
Gol'darnit, dag nab it, dad burn it, dad blame it.
Here comes the life of the party.
Goes down, smooth. Hey, look what the cat dragged in.
Have no fear. Charlie's here.
Oh, it's you is it.
Jumping Jehosophat!
It's a miracle!
Hi, guys.
Now that's a purty little heifer.
Why Pete's the best darn cook on the Panhandle!
Why I oughta!
Ready. Set. Go -
 HiYo Silver! A cloud of dust, a galloping horse with the speed of light, a hearty Hi-Yo Silver! The Lone Ranger! With his faithful Indian companion Tonto, the daring and resourceful Masked Rider of the Plains came to Earth with powers- and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear - from out of the...
You doorknob! You threw in Superman!
Too bad. Close to a record.
 I hate it when the beer comes out my nose.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
You know, I never could figure that one out.
I was thinking of four ushers and four bridesmaids.
The Yanks got the hitting but the Sox got the defense.
What are your colors, going to be?
I'l1 take Kubek and Richardson over Fox and Aparicio.
I'm thinking of pink and green.
Look at Dolores. What a tramp.
Pitching wins pennants. The Tigers got four potential twenty game winners.
You'd be surprised at how many girls in school aren't virgins.
Don Mossi, Frank Lary, Jim Sunning and Paul Foytack.
And now, direct from three weeks of rehearsal in Walter's garage, four guys who have dedicated their lives to becoming the greatest singing group in the world... Charlie, Walter, Leon and Terry. The Definitions.
One, two, three-...
Charlie really has a great voice.
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
Don't get your hopes up.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
He does?
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Are you for real?
Touchy, touchy!
 I don't know what you said to her, but I wish I'd said it.
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
He's trying.
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
 Come on, let's dance.
Put on some makeout music, and kill the lights.
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
You really love me, don't you?
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
 Charlie, let's make love.
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
A lot's happened since last weekend.
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
 I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
Who?
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
What is this? What the hell is going on? One week you say, "If you love me you won't", now you say "If you love me you will".  Excuse me. That's a guy's line!
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
I'm sorry Charlie.
Save it.
What would you like?
Monica? Aren't you Monica Hines?
Yes. Who are you?
Ah... never mind. Can I have a coffee, please? And a cinnamon cruller.  How's Bobo?
Twenty cents, please.
You're kidding?
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
You don't?
 He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
What're you doing here anyway?
Coffee and a donut.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
Terry, slow down.
Okay.
Terry! Slow down.
What, why?
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
This is great reefer.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
What are you shooting for?
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.'
Don't you get along with your parents?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
You know, I had you pegged all wrong.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
Is that one of your poems?
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
I'd love to.
 Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms (sees Peggy grimace; he calms down) I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 
Michael... you're as good as you looked.
I'll respect you for eternity.  'When you are old and gray, and full of sleep, And nodding by the fire, Take down this book, and slowly read, And dream of the soft look your eyes had once."  I didn't write that. That's Yeats.
I envy you. You have your whole life ahead of you and you know exactly what you want to do.  But forget the rat puke; write something beautiful.
You know, this isn't really happening.
Your parents are waiting up. You know, I see a lot of this in the spring. Good luck.
Thanks, Ralph.
Where have you been?
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
Damn that Charlie I
It's not Charlie. It's me.
 Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
At my age? Don't be silly.
Thank God for that.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
All right. But this better be good.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Evelyn, take her to her room!
I'm not the maid!
Way to go, Mom!
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
Richard, take it easy.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Give me some credit, will you?
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
Wbat're you talking about?
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.
Sixtyforty.
That's not fair.
Okay, find yourself another vision.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
When do we start?
Do you know what you want?
A Ton on a Bun, with fries.
And you?
Quiche Lorraine, spinach salad and a Perrier.
Dry cleaners. No real change. Just higher prices.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
Come on. You can't be serious.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
Look at that stuff. It's like the dark ages. This is more your speed. And boy, do I know this business.
Let's see...  icrowavemays, ocketpay alculatorcays...
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Oh.    And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
I'll be right back.
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
What are you talking about?
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
High tech. I like the sound of that.
 Look at that freezer chest. What capacity.  Hello Peggy Sue.
Woody! How ya doing?
Fine, just fine.
Nice to see you.
Charlie's in the back.
My future daughterinlaw. Very affectionate girl.
I'll just take the Ravel.
Take the Shostakovich home and listen to it. Let it grow on you. Everyone that's bought it has come back and said, "This is definitive Shostakovich. Thank you for encouraging me to investigate it."
Well, I did enjoy the Dvorak you suggested. Young man, you talked me into it.
You'll like it. I kid you not.
What do you know about classical music?
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Charlie. About last nights..
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
Why?
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
What am I going to do with you?
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Hi, Dad.
Doing some shopping?
For me?
Open it.
Sweetheart, they're beautiful. But they must've been expensive.
I closed my Christmas club.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
Quiet today?
This morning was good.
The hat business is in trouble.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Yes.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
 He'll win.
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that?
Please don't shout.
I'm not shouting. Have we ever starved? Have we ever missed a mea1?
Does everybody have to hear?
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
Jack, I was just trying to help.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
Does this mean we're going to be poor?
All right. What's the scoop?
On what?
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
That's disgusting!
 Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eightysix.
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
Just what you underlined.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
That loudmouthed little bitch~
Peggy Sue!
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
Aren't we a little old for that?
Sometimes you're so immature.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
Would they go over my girdle or under?
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
Jack, I think she's got something there.
And we won't just sell them in department stores. We'll market them in drug stores and supermarkets.
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Isn't that awfully forward?
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
 I have to talk to you..
What are you doing here?
 Let's go down to the basement.
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
 Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
I just can't trust you anymore.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
But what has to be different?
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!
 Hello, Grandma. It's Peggy Sue. Much better. How are you? I'm very sorry about the other day.
 Hi, Richard.
What are you doing?
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Like what?
 Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three. (Peggy's eyes flutter open) We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
 Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
What will they be made of?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Silicon is from sand.
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Will you take of f your blouse?
Yes, every day. (taking her blouse off getting spaced) Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
Richard, are you in there?
 No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
I couldn't help it  I loved him.
One... two... three.  You are now awake.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
What's pasta?
These roses are beautiful. And so romantic'. Who is this Michael? Is he a friend of Charlie's?
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.
What does Charlie think about that?
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
 What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
Of course I loved your Lather. I remember once being offered a scholarship to art school. But I turned it down.
Why?
All the college girls I knew were so well, dressed. I was worried that I wouldn't fit in. I didn't have the right clothes. I was so silly. But, I don't have many regrets, and besides, r don't have time to worry about the past. But Charlie. I hope you know what you're doing.
Moose?  I never thought I'd have moose for desert.
Peggy Sue cooked the whole dinner.
But Mom helped.
You know, you should open a restaurant.
It's incredibly difficult to make money in the restaurant business. You have to get up at five in the morning to go to the market, you have problems with spoilage, employee pilferage, and just try and collect from the credit card companies. They take months to pay.
How does a young gal like you know so much about business?
Oh, I just picked it up from my dad. He's a wonderful businessman.
Really?
Ah, Ed, why don't you and I adjourn to the den for a while?
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
No. Something else. I'm too full. Besides, it's a school night.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
 For everyone.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
 I can't do that.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
I hate chickens.
Thank you. Now we're happy to introduce, a friend of ours. He's one damn fine singer, Mr. Charlie Dell!
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
You think so?
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
It's Charlie!
What a treat.
Now I get it.
Ssh. He's great.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
I thought I knew everything about him.
Can we split now?
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
What?
My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Oh no!
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
Oh, you're both so naive.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
You have a point, dear.
What're you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Rusty's dead. That's Ajax
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
How'd you know about that?
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
That's real big of you.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
Just take a look at it. 
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Does this mean you like me again?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
Peggy, I have to talk to you.
What's the matter?
It's that jerk Walter.
What happened?
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
Hey Charlie, what do you think of this?
Walter, maybe you should be a dentist.
And finally, our heartiest congratulations to our girls diving team for placing second in the county finals last Friday. And a special accolade to Rosalie Testa who placed first in every one of her events. We're proud of you, Rosalie.
What's the matter, princess? Lost your prince?
You know Dolores, there's a lot of things I could say to you, but you're not worth the effort.
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
 Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
I beg your pardon?
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Have a nice day.
Rosalie! Wait!
What's up?
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
But accidents can happen.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
What's the matter?
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
Peggy, I believe you. I believe everything you told me. It's wonderful. You're the exception that proves the rule.
I love you too, Richard. Thanks for trying.
Hey, Peggy. Wait a minute.
I cut shop and did some work on your song. You know, it's not half bad for your first try. Of course, I changed all the "yeahs" to "oohs". Listen to this.
Forget it, it'll never work.
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
Everybody gettin' off at Dumont. Here we are.
Thank you.
No trouble at all.
Hello, Lilla!
Peggy Sue!
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
 Fine.  Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
What's the matter, Lilla? Somebody jump on your grave?
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
I wish she hadn't.
I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die.
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventyfive? Eighty?
I'm not telling.
I've been trying to drag it out of her for years.  You know, dreams are fascinating business. 'Specially where you see the future.
Do you believe in all of that?
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
But I'm remembering the future.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
 I'd take better care of my teeth.
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
Let's go.
 Goodbye, Grandma.
Have a good time.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
Stag movies. Smokers.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
Welcome, Peggy Sue. It's nice to have you with us.
Thank you.
You know, you're a lucky girl. You could lay a bear trap in the aisle of the cathedral and never catch a better man than your grandfather.
Ah... thank you.
Let me take your jacket, Lilla. I've got, to get my robe.
You know, this is very exciting for all of us.
We've been waiting a long time for someone like you.
 Do you have to wear that hat?
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
Don't you worry. I'll be watching after you.
Hey, George. Get the lights.
 Are you ready, dear?
Yes, sir.
Fasten your seat belts. Here we go.
Lord of the Universe, Vast and Mighty One. Ruler of Light, King of~ the sun. Creator of earth, air, fire and water.  We adore thee and invoke thee! Grant thine aid. Look with favor upon us as we witness the regeneration of man. We behold the innocent endeavors of singleminded men and women. For we are the company of unbodied souls and immortal angels. We ask thy intervention, that this girl may return to thee on the wings of your Love.
 This is never going to work.
Fount of life, Chariot of the Spirit, Womb of the Mother, reclaim thy child of light.
The name of your love is sacrifice. We offer up this girl, that her soul may find its home.
Nothing to worry about. Somebody get the lights.
 Well, the girl's gone. Let's play some poker.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
You're going to listen to me.
I'm not getting in that blue monstrosity.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
Right here. Now sit down.
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
Because I love you, damnit! I had a long talk with your father yesterday and we decided that the best thing for us to do is get married and settle down. Right away.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
What?
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
Oh, Peggy. My poor Peggy. It's all my fault. I'm so sorry. I won't bother you anymore. I promise. Please stop crying. Please.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
Of course.
It's almost your birthday. I wasn't sure when you were coming back, so I brought your present up here.
 Oh, Charlie.
It opens, too. Look inside.
Scott and Beth. Where did you get these?
Who's Scott and Beth? Your mother gave me our picture. That's you and me.
So are Scott and Beth.
 I love you.
I know.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
 Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
What the hell is that?
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
I've got to go now.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
Come back to me.
I'm trying.
Richard, do something!
I can't! It's out of control!
Peggy!
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
Charlie? Was I dead?
I thought you were...for a while.
 You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
What about Janet?
That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
Who are all the flowers from?
Everyone.  Maddie and Arthur, Carol and Walter. Richard Norvick.  And here's a book, by that guy from high school, Michael Fitzsimmons. He dedicated it to you.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
I'll just set it right here.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
Oh, God, Dion.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
I'll never give up.
Then hold me.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
Charlie, please, I need some time.
Well, I'll let you get some rest...so long.
Charlie, I would like to invite you to dinner at home, on Sunday, with your kids. I will make a strudel.
