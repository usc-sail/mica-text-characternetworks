Sadie, wake up.
Oh my gosh.
Daddy, wake up. Charlotte hits Pete.
Okay, I'm up.
I need you to take the kids to school this morning.
Oh, I would, but I'm supposed to work out.
What?
I got an appointment with a trainer. I can't cancel now, he'll charge me.
Well, you didn't tell me.
Yeah I did. Last week, I told you.
You didn't tell me.
I did. And then I wrote it on the calendar like you told me to.
No, you didn't tell me.
I did tell you.
Well, you didn't, but what are we going to do? Because I have an appointment so you're taking the kids to school. Pete holds Charlotte in front of him.
Don't use the baby to cover your tracks.
I can drive them. I'll drive them to school.
Thank you very much.
Great. Good. You turned my sister into a limo driver.
I don't mind.
What are you giggling about?
Poo poo.
Ladies. Nice.
You know what I did the other day?
What?
I Googled "murder."
You Googled "murder?"
Yeah.
Why? I mean what did it say?
It didn't say anything. It just showed pictures of people lying dead on the floor and...blood everywhere and ugh...
That was just ketchup.
I want to hear "Rent."
I want to hear Green Day!
No, we're listening to "Rent."
Well, I want to listen to Green Day. Sadies takes Charlotte's doll.
Well, I got your baby!
Don't taunt her. Come on.
Here. Sadie shoves the doll at Charlotte.
Sadie!
Why did you just do that? Don't throw things at your sister!
She hit me.
Did you hit her?
I did not.
Make her happy.
It won't make her happy. She spilled all the marbles on the floor.
Well, give her her marbles back.
All right? Now, are you sure you understand the terms of the bet? `Cause this is serious.
Oh, no.
Martin, listen. You don't shave your beard or cut your hair for one year, and if you can do that, I will pay your rent. But if you shave, then you have to pay all five of our rents.
Thanks for the free money, bitch.
Hey, Martin, was it weird when you joined the Taliban, being American and everything like that? Like when you see a woman driving a car, do you just get pissed?
Just watch your back, Serpico. You never know who your friends are.
You guy can't make fun of the me the whole time.
But, Martin, it's a competition. It's called "The Dirty Man Competition." We're gonna make fun of you until you shave the beard. That's the rules.
That's the whole point. You're supposed to be tempted into shaving.
Your face looks like Robin Williams' knuckles.
You guys aren't allowed to make fun of me. It's not part of the rules.
Martin, why didn't you just listen to me when I was explaining the rules? You just looked at me with that blank stare of yours. It was like talking to a wax statue.
Okay, guys, are you ready? So... "Only at `Flesh of the Stars.com' will customers be able to find exactly how long into what movies their favorite stars are exposed."
Nice.
Oh, fuckin' booya.
Pretty good, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, ka-ching. Ka-ching. Ka-ching.
Guys, let's start loggin', all right? Charles Manson? Do you have any other thoughts?
Good, awesome, let's start this off with a bang. Jamie Lee Curtis. I got an hour and ten minutes in "Trading Places." Uh, both chesticles.
Ah, I got something. A three-titted alien from "Total Recall?"
Aw, she's not famous.
So if you want that perfect tan like the stars, he's the one to see. We'll be right back on "E! News." Stay with us.
 Okay.
Okay, is Jessica Simpson here yet?
Let me check.
Is she on her way?
Hey, guys?
She's left her house?
 Okay, let me know when she's pulling in.
Is she camera-ready?
 Is she camera-ready?
If she's going to be in hair and makeup for three hours. I can't do it. I'm not going to be here. I got to do "American Idol." It's live. I got to do it. I got to be there. What are we going to interview her about?
Nothing personal.
No personal questions.
No personal questions. Don't ask her about her sister and her nose job.
No plastic surgery questions.
She doesn't want to talk about her boobs or her father's comments about her boobs.
Great. We'll talk about the Middle East and maybe an idea of an exit strategy. Maybe she has a good pitch. Should I ask her about Korea? Maybe have her point it out to us on a globe? I don't understand the young talent in this town! It doesn't make any sense. I got four jobs. Hell, I'm more famous than half the people we talk to anyway! No one stands up. No one has the balls to sit them down and say, "Look, just cut the shit."But everybody works for `em. They're all on the payroll. They're all sucking the teat! Nobody sits `em down, eye-to- eye, one-on-one, and says... "Cut the shit." And all these stars just to fuck it up. That's what they do. They fuck my day up! And it pisses me off! And now I'm sweating.
You know what? You want us to just come and get you when she gets here? You want to head to the green room for a minute? Just chill out?
That's a good idea.
Want us to bring you anything? You want some water?
No.
You want a cookie?
Cookie, yeah, cookie. Thanks.
Okay, we'll get you a cookie.
I'm sorry I'm pissy. JILL, one of the E! executives, approaches Alison.
Alison?
Yeah?
Jack and I need to see you in his office.
Thanks for coming in, Alison. Well, we wanted to talk to you today because we had a little debate on the conference call with New York about you.
You were talking about me?
We were wondering aloud to one another whether or not you would be good for on-camera.
What'd you decide?
They decided that they like you. And they would like to put you on camera.
Really?
I know. I was so surprised, too.
Oh, my God. This is the best news ever. Thank you so much. This is great!
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I'll take that smile as a "Yes, I'll do it."
Absolutely. I'm so excited. Oh, my God.
It's a lot of work. Can't wait to see what happens. It's going to be tough. Tough job.
About the work, most immediately, there's going to be some things that you're going to be able to get that other people in the office don't get. One of them: Gym membership.
You want me to lose weight?
I don't want you to lose weight.
We can't legally ask you to do that.
We didn't say lose weight.
No.
I might say "tighten."
"Tight."
A little...tighter?
Just like toned and smaller.
Don't make everything smaller. I don't want to generalize that way. Tighter.
We don't want you to lose weight. We just want you to be healthy.
Okay.
You know, by, by eating less. We would just like it if you...go home and step on the scale and write down how much you weigh and subtract it by, like, twenty.
Twenty.
And then weigh that much.
Just remember, you've got it here, you've got it here, and everybody's going see you right there.
Yay! That's so exciting!
Yay!
Oh my god!
Huh?
I got a promotion.
Oh, congratulations!
Thank you.
Hey, maybe you can get your own place now.
Oh, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Yay!
Let's go celebrate.
Okay, let's do it.
Pete'll watch the kids?
Yeah! We can watch "Taxicab Confessions."
What are you going to do?
I don't know! Debbie and Alison SHRIEK.
I'm so excited.
Yay!
I walked in on him masturbating one night.
Ooh! Did you get the deer-in-the- headlights look? Did he freeze or did he finish?
No, he tried to pretend like he wasn't doing anything under the covers.
Oh, no!
I buy these nice towels and he whacks off into them.
"Deb and Pete forever"
And once he does that into them once, they're never soft ever again.
I can always tell if I'm looking good based on whether or not we get in. They reach the front. The Bouncer looks at them and waves them in.
Ladies?
Guess we're looking good.
If I didn't get in, I would have lost my shit. Ben and the guys are standing at the head of the line.
What's going on man? How long you gonna make us wait out here, for Christ's sake?
Come on! What the fuck!
You know what movie I just saw again the other day which is fucking, like, mind-blowing, and I haven't seen it since it came out? "Munich."
"Munich!"
Dude, "Munich" fuckin' rules.
"Munich" is awesome!
That movie was Eric Bana kicking fuckin' ass! They all agree.
Dude, every movie with Jews, we're the ones getting killed. "Munich" flips it on its ear. We cappin' motherfuckers.
Not only killing, but fuckin', like, takin' names.
If any of us get laid tonight, it's because of Eric Bana in "Munich."
I agree with that.
I agree.
You know what is not helping us get laid? Is the shoe bomber, Richard Reid, over here at our table. I like your shoes.
How was "Burning Man" this year?
Fuck you guys, I'm glad I'm not Jewish.
So are we.
Fine. Screw it.
You weren't "chosen" for a reason.
Yeah. Ahh!
Ohh!!! Meanwhile, Debbie and Alison head for the bar.
It's like everyone in here is twelve years old. Debbie SIGHS.
Am I too old to be here?
What?
Am I too old to be here?
No, of course not.
Does it look weird that I'm here?
No, not at all.
Am I hotter than these little bitches?
Yes! You look amazing.
Guys in here would fuck me, right?
Yes.
That's weird to say, but, it makes me feel better.
You look hot.
I believe you.
I'm getting us drinks. Alison leaves for the bar.
Yo, a beer over here, please? You're gonna be embarrassed when you realize I'm Wilmer Valderrama. God.
 Oh, Hey! Excuse me!
He's literally ignoring this entire half of the bar. Don't even bother.
Yeah, awesome.
A beer over here, please? He looked at us! Did you see that?
Yeah, that was rough.
And if you can't get service, what am I gonna do, you know?
Great. It's going to be that night.
Okay, you want a beer?
Yeah.
Just observe.
There you go.
Come on, man!
Here you go! For your trouble! Thank you. Ben hands one beer to Alison BEN
Thank you.
Okay, enjoy it.
Are you sure?
I'm sure. I tried that once before at The Comedy Store and I got punched in the ear.
Thanks a lot, Oh, fuck, fuck! I'm supposed to get one for my sister.
Oh, here, take mine. Ben hands Alison his beer.
No, that's okay. I'll wait. I'll, he'll get me--
Thank you. Awesome.
No problem.
I'm Alison.
I'm Ben. An awkward beat passes between them.
Well, have a great night.
Okay, you too. Have a--
Thanks for the beer.
Okay, enjoy, be nice to them.
Bye. Thanks again. Alison leaves the bar to rejoin Debbie.
I'll see ya later.
What's up, daddy?
That girl. She, she totally gave me an opening, man, and I locked up. I just want to get shit-faced, though, you know? I'll just jerk it later. It's cool.
Are you fuckin' crazy, man? She looks...smart. Who's that she's sitting with?
It's her sister.
Her sister?
Yeah.
Dude, it's the dream. What are we doin' standing here man? Let's go. Come on, follow me.
Why?
`Cause your face looks like a vagina.
Dick! Ben and Jason head toward Alison and Debbie.
Hey, which one's the sister? Jonah approaches Martin.
Hey, Crockett. You still partyin' with Tubbs these days?
Come on, man. I'm getting it from all angles here. I don't like it anymore.
I know, I don't either. Was it weird when you changed your name from Cat Stevens to Yusuf Islam?
Yeah, it was really awkward.
All right, man. I got to take off. See ya, "Scorsese on coke." Jay GROWLS loudly.
What's that?
Chewbacca. It's, you know, it's Chewie.
Oh, another beard joke.
Fuck.
Fuckin' hilarious! Meanwhile, Ben and Jason get to Alison and Debbie's table.
Hey.
Hey.
Hi, this is my friend, Jason. I just wanted to see how my beers were doin'.
This is my sister, Debbie.
Oh, hi, I'm Ben.
Hi, Ben?
Yes.
Nice to meet you.
How ya doin'?
Good, how are you?
Just trying not to stare.
She's married.
What?
It's a shame. You're beautiful.
Thank you.
She has two kids, too.
Shut up!
What? It's nothing to be ashamed of.
You think that's gonna stop him from hitting on her? It's not, at all.
I love kids.
Really?
Yeah, absolutely. Debbie's cell phone RINGS.
Excuse me.  Hello?
Cool phone.
Yeah, she's got a really cool phone.
 What? Is it a rash or is it the chicken pox? I don't know! Google it. Okay. All right, bye.  I got to go. Sadie might have the chicken pox.
I had the chicken pox three times. I have no immunity to it.
We don't have the heart to tell him it's herpes.
It's not herpes if it's everywhere.
Um, uh, you know, I'm all dressed, so I'll just hang out.
Really?
Yeah, I'll take a cab home.
Be safe.
I will.
Bye, lovely.
Bye. Debbie leaves.
All right, I'm gonna let you two get to know each other.
Ben and Alison talking, dancing and drinking.
Cheers.
Cheers.
To you. Ben and Alison take pictures of each other with their cell phones.
No, no. You know, the like, Entertainment News channel?
Oh, E!
Ben and Alison dance, clearly pretty drunk now. We see Ben's friends in the background, also dancing. Ben pretends to throw dice while dancing.
Dude, I think he's doing the dice thing too much.
That's really all he's got. Alison and Ben take another shot. Alison runs her fingers through Ben's hair.
I love your curly hair! It's so great. Do you, like, use product or anything? You put anything in it?
I use Jew. You want to get out of here?
Yeah, let's go. We can go hang out at my place?
Yes, uh, uh, uh...
I'll show you my audition tape.
Wicked.
It's really funny.
Okay, I'm really excited to watch that. They exit the club.
We should get a cab. Ben grabs Alison and they kiss.
This is a big yard!
Shh!
Let's go swimming right now. Let's just do that.
No.
I'm doin'-- Whoo!
You're prettier than I am. They continue to make out.
Do you have a condom?
I do.
Okay.
It's in my pants. I have a condom.
Okay.
I'll get it. Ben grabs his pants and takes out a condom.
Man. Ben struggles to put on the condom.
Come on.
Hurry up.
 Stupid fucker.
What are you doing?
I almost got it. Just give me a second.
Oh, God, just do it already!
Okay. Ben throws the condom on the floor and rolls over onto Alison.
Good thing I'm drunk. This is lasting forever.
Yeah, it's awesome.
I just doubled my record time.
Okay, just stop taking.
Fuck off, Martin. I said, fuck off Martin. Ben awakens and turns around.
Hi.
Oh. Hey.
Hey. Ben assesses the situation.
I'm naked.
Yeah.
Yes.
Nice.
Seven-thirty.
Why the fuck are we awake? Let's go back to sleep.
I have to go to work.
Really?
Do you need to get to work or anything?
No work today. Do you want to get breakfast?
Okay.
`Morning.
Good morning Alison.
I'm Ben. What's happenin', man?
Ben.
How's it goin'? Pete shakes Ben's hand and smiles.
Stop it.
You stop it.
See ya later.
All righty.
See ya later. Enjoy the day.
I'm gonna do it.
You are? Uh-oh. Someone's getting home- schooled.
Whew. I just yacked, something nasty. I feel way better, though. I think that's the secret. You just gotta puke. Did you puke?
No.
You can. I won't think it's gross or anything.
I'm fine.
Oh, okay.
I just need some coffee, so...
You know, the best thing for a hangover's weed. Do you smoke? Do you smoke weed?
Not really.
You don't?
No.
At all?
Mm-mm.
Like in the morning?
No, I just don't.
It's the best medicine. `Cause it fixes everything. Jonah broke his elbow once. We just got high and, it still clicks, but, I mean, he's okay.
Right.
Yeah. Last night was great...what I remember of it?
Right, yeah.
Yeah.
We had a great time.
Yeah. So what do you do?
I work at E!
The television channel?
Uh-huh, remember?
Wow.
We had, we had this conversation last night. I, I told you about my promotion and I was out celebrating it. No?
I don't remember that at all.
I'm super excited about it. I'm actually doing my first on-air interview today.
With who?
Matthew Fox.
Matthew Fox from "Lost?"
Yeah.
You know what's interesting about him?
What?
Nothing. Will you tell him he's an asshole for me?
No.
Someone needs to. Like who gives a shit?
I hope a lot of people actually because that's what my job entails, is making sure people care about what he has to say. I'm interviewing him.
Maybe it's just me. Maybe I just don't give a shit. I'm just saying he deserves a beat down.
It's sort of embarrassing to ask at this point, but what do you do for work?
Me and my roommates have started...we're starting an Internet website.
Oh, cool, what is it?
I'll give you the virtual experience okay? How's that? You're at your computer. Who's an actress you like?
Mary Tyler Moore?
No, that does not work at all. Let's say you love Meg Ryan.
I do.
Great. Who doesn't? Let's say you like her so much, you want to know every movie where she shows her tits. And not just that, but how long into that movie she shows her tits. Come to our web page, exclusively, type in `Meg Ryan.' Bam! `In the Cut,' thirty-eight minutes in, forty-eight minutes in, like an hour and ten minutes in. She's like naked that whole fuckin' movie. She does full-frontal in that movie.
They should have called her Harry, not Sally.
Really.
I'll show it to you. I'll show you Meg Ryan's bush.
Cool.
I actually need to get going, so.
Awesome. Can I get your number? Alison is incredulous.
We had fun, right? We should hook up again.
I'm gonna give you my card because that'll be the best way...
If you want to contact me, I don't have a cell right now because of payment complications, but you can email me at the web page, I check it. It's Ben at flesh of the stars, one word, dot com. Alison gets out of the booth. Ben gets up too.
So, awesome.
All right then. Nice to meet you. Ben puts his arms out for a hug. Alison complies. Ben kisses the air.
Take care.
Okay, uh, see ya. Alison exits the diner.
Bye!
Hi, I'm Alison Scott and we're here today with James Franco from "Spider Man."
How are you?
Great.
Thanks for coming.
Of course.
Tell me, were you a big fan... Alison GULPS and appears uncomfortable.
...I'm sorry, let me take that again.
Okay.
Tell me, were you a big fan of the comic books growing up?
No, actually, I didn't read any of the comic books until I got the movie. Alison stares at the floor looking ill. She breathes heavily. JAMES FRANCO Are you okay?
Uh-huh. Yeah, just, what about the comic books? Keep talking.
Like I said I really wasn't into them, but now that I did the research, I think they're pretty amazing. Alison runs offstage and VOMITS into a trash can. Repeatedly. JAMES FRANCO What the fuck? Alison continues to puke.
Is that the sound of you puking?
If this is one of those fuckin' joke shows, I'm not into it.
We should put this on YouTube.
Shut up.
This is hilarious.
You're an asshole.
Look how sweaty you are. You look like Dom DeLuise.
I don't need to see it again. It's gonna make me throw up.
You look like Jabba the Hutt dying. Brent HISSES like Jabba the Hutt.
You're such an asshole.
I'm just jerking your chain. I'll fix this. No problem.
Yeah, maybe if you can just edit this out and we can re-- Alison swallows hard.
--we can reshoot my questions. Alison looks ill again.
What's up? Alison is frantically looking for a place to vomit. BRENT Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no. Over here. Not on the mixing board, not on the mixing board. Alison finds the trash and VOMITS.
Are you okay?
Oh my god. Oh my god.
Are you sick?
I don't know.
What'd you eat?
I haven't eaten today yet.
You haven't eaten yet?
Do you have a napkin or something? Brent grabs a stray piece of paper.
Here, here. What do you have, like the flu?
I don't know.
God, I hope you're not pregnant.
It's impossible. You have to have sex to get pregnant. Alison reacts with a sad realization. Brent picks up the phone.
 B.K. It's Brent Master Five. Alison just puked. Dude, that's what I said. She's probably pregnant, right?
Oh, shit.
 How does she look right now? She looks like she just realized that she's pregnant.
No, I can't be pregnant. Right? That was what, eight weeks ago?
Did you miss your period?
No. Wait. I don't know. Shit. I don't know. I can't remember. I was, I mean, I've been really stressed at work. I can't remember my last period.
Are you the lady who doesn't realize she's pregnant until she's sitting on the toilet and a kid pops out?
Can you not joke right now? Don't joke right now. This is really serious.
Did I meet him?
Yeah. You know, he was kind of like medium height, sort of...chubby. Blonde, curly hair. Remember?
With the man boobs.
Yes! Here, I have this thing of him on my phone. Alison takes out her phone to play a video.
Hey! I live in your phone! This is the best night of my life! I gotta pee.
Oh god. How did this happen?
Oh, shit.
Well there's only one way to find out.
They're here! Here they are! Over here! Every test on the shelf is pulled into their basket.
Okay. "Positive Choice."
"Easy, One, Two, Three." They run toward the check out counter.
Here. Hurry up now. Come on. The test reads positive.
Get more! Get me a few more!
Did you try the "Ova-Sure?" Alison furiously drinks some juice.
I'm dripping, I'm dripping. Wait. They check another test.
Good! A smiley face! Oh, I think that's bad.
How long does this one take?
These can't all be positive. Let me try one. Pete enters to see Debbie sitting on the toilet. Debbie urinates on the test and checks it.
God, you really had to pee. Debbie picks up a test. It's positive.
What is this? What the hell is this?
I think you picked up the wrong one.
Fuck. That scared me. That would suck. Alison glares at Debbie.
I'm sorry. That scared me.
It's gonna be fine. Right? Debbie contemplates. ALISON Right?
Of course it will be fine. It's gonna be fine.
Shit.
You just need to call him.
Maybe I don't need to call him until after I see the doctor.
You need to call.
I don't want to call him. I don't need to call him.
You should call.
I can't call him anyway. He doesn't even have a phone. He didn't even have a number to give me.
He doesn't have a phone?
Said some kind of billing issue.
He can't afford a phone? Sadie has a phone.
Shit, you're right. I got to call. I don't know. I'm gonna have to look him up on his stupid website.
What kind of website does he have?
He spelling "coming" wrong. Oh it's "cum." That's gross.
Just go to "Contact Us."
Ben?
Yeah. Debbie begins to type the email.
"What is your number? I need to speak with you right away." Send?
Yep.
You're sure?
Yeah.
I love weed.
I could smoke weed every second of every day. Ben wears a gas mask attached to a bong.
 Jay, I am your stoner. Everyony LAUGHS. Jason sits with his laptop.
Hey, Benjamin?
Yeah.
"Flesh of the Stars" just got an e- mail.
Really?
Would you like me to read it to you?
Yeah, sure.
"Ben, what is your number? I need to speak to you right away. Alison Scott"
Shit! Someone wants seconds, mama!
"Looking forward to speaking with you."
Yeah. Do one of those smiley faces at the end. Fuckin' A. Those are sexy.
Sent.
Uh-oh!
Somebody wants another piece!
Shhh....
 Hello?
 Hi, Ben, this is Alison. I don't know if you remember me.
 Oh, yeah, Alison. What's up? Ben is humping Jason's head.
She like-a the way your dick tastes.
 I actually was just wondering if maybe you, wanted to get together, like tomorrow night?
 I've been meaning to call you so we could hook up again. You know what I'm sayin'?
 Let's meet up maybe tomorrow night? You wanna just grab some dinner?
 Why not? Meeting of minds sounds good. What do you say Geisha House, Hollywood, nine o'clock?
 Sure. That's cool. Can we make it more like six, though? I'd like to keep it early.
 Six o'clock. Beat the rush. Yeah, leave more time for afterwards. Dessert. Sweet.
 Okay. I'll just meet you there, then, at six. All the guys mime having sex with each other.
 I'll see you there. Take care. Peace.
Oh, shit.
I'm gonna get laid mother fuckers! High fives all around for Ben and the roommates.
Nice place, huh?
It's really nice.
Sorry it took so long to get a table. I didn't realize you needed a reservation.
That's okay.
You look very pretty, though.
Thanks. Yeah, I just thought, I don't know, I thought maybe it'd be cool to hang out a little bit and... We didn't really get to talk much last time so I
That we didn't.
I thought maybe we'd just talk and get to know each other...better.
Cool. Okay, I'll start. I'm Canadian.
That's cool.
From Vancouver. I live here illegally, actually. Don't tell anyone. But it works out in my advantage, ultimately, `cause I don't have to pay any taxes. So financially that's helpful `cause I don't have a lot of money. I'm not poor or anything but I eat a lot of spaghetti.
So the web page is it just something that you guys do for fun? Do you have a real job?
Well, that is our job.
Oh.
We don't technically get money for the hours we put in, but it is our job.
So, how do you...?
How do I pay rent and shit?
Right.
When I was in high school, I got ran over by a postal truck.
Oh, my God.
It was my foot more than anything. But, I got fourteen grand from the British Columbia government.
Right.
And that really lasted me until now. It's been almost ten years. I have like nine hundred bucks left. So that should last me for I'm not a mathematician, but like another two years or some shit...I think.
Yeah. So, I have something I really need to tell you. It's kind of why I called you. Here it goes. I'm pregnant.
Fuck off.
What?
What?
I'm pregnant...?
With emotion?
With a baby. You're the father.
I'm the father.
Yes!
How the fuck could this happen?
I don't know. I thought you were wearing a condom.
No.
What?
I wasn't.
Why not?
Because you told me not to.
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about? You told me not to.
I did not tell you not to wear a condom.
Here's what happened, okay? I will give you a play-by-play of my memory. I almost had the condom on my dick. It was on the cusp and then you said, "Just do it, already."
I didn't mean do it without a condom. I mean "do it" like "hurry up," like "get fucking going!"
Well, I assumed you were wearing a patch, or like a dental dam or one of those fuckin' butterfly clips or something like that.
What the hell is a dental dam?
It's like Saran Wrap! It's disgusting, okay? But I thought you had one. Why the fuck didn't you stop me once we started?
Oh, my God! I don't know! I couldn't tell that you didn't have one on! Obviously, I was drunk!
Was your vagina drunk? Did you think it's the thinnest condom on earth I have on? I'm a fuckin' inventor? I made a dick-skin condom? He hollowed out a penis and put it on? What the fuck?!
You are unbelievable.
Okay, you know what? Maybe, I've reacted unfavorably. So what happens now? I don't know how this works.
I am going to the doctor next week...and I thought you could come with me to the gynecologist.
So you haven't seen him, though?
No.
So you don't know if you're pregnant.
Well, I'm not a hundred percent sure.
You're not a hundred percent sure. I bet you're not pregnant.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm supposed to go?
Yes.
Hello. My name is Thomas Pellagrino.
I'm Ben Stone.
Hi, there, champ. And you must be Debbie's sister...Alice.
Alison.
Hi. How are ya?
Good.
So, what can I help you with today, Mister and Mrs. Stone?
I took a home pregnancy test and it said I was pregnant, so here we are.
Let's have a look. Legs up. Alison puts her legs up and leans back.
Nice office.
Thank you. Dr. Pellagrino examines Allison's genital area. DR. PELLAGRINO Well, you do look a lot like your sister. Dr. Pellagrino picks up a long cone shaped device. DR. PELLAGRINO This is gonna be cold.
That, that's it?
Yep. Take good care of it. Now the fun part starts. Let me make a picture for ya, huh? That'll be fun. Alison begins to CRY. DR. PELLAGRINO Well, I'll meet ya in my office. I'll give ya a little time alone, there.
Oh, God. It's okay.
I can't fuckin' believe you didn't wear a bag! Who does that?!
Why did we go to Costco and buy a year's supply of condoms if you weren't gonna use `em, man?
I can't believe you did this. You fucked everything up.
Look, the real point is not to get yourself in this position. That's what you have to realize. You gotta know all the tricks. Like, for example, if a woman's on top, she can't get pregnant. It's just gravity.
Everyone knows that.
What goes up must come down.
I think it's awesome that you're gonna have a kid, man. Think of it like this. It's just an excuse to play with all your old toys again.
You know what I think you should do? Take care of it.
Tell me you don't want him to get an "A word."
Yes, I do, and I won't say it for little Baby Ears over there, but it rhymes with shmish-mortion." I'm just saying -- hold on Jay, cover your ears -- you should get a "shmish-morshmion" are the "shmish-morshmion" clinic.
Ben, you cannot let these monsters have any part of your child's life. All right? I'm gonna be there to rear your child.
You hear that, Ben? Don't let him near the kid. He wants to rear your child! Ben gets up and leaves the room.
Aw, Ben. Ben, come on, man.
I'm just kidding you.
Oh, great. Now he's upset.
I won't let him do it.
Alison, just take care of it. Take care of it. Move on. What's gonna happen with your career? Or how, how are you gonna tell them?
Well, I'm not gonna tell them for a while. I have a while before I have to say anything.
How could you not tell them?
Well, they're not gonna know. I mean, I'm only gonna start to show when I'm like, I don't know, six months or something. Seven months.
Three months.
No.
Three months. Fat in the face, jowls, fast ass.
Debbie didn't get fat.
Debbie is a freak of nature.
Mom, you know, it's important to me that you be supportive.
I cannot be supportive of this. This is a mistake. This is a big, big mistake. Now think about your stepsister. Now, you remember what happened with her? She had the same situation as you and she had it taken care of. And you know what? Now she has a real baby. Honey, this is not the time.
I'm gonna be a grandfather.
You happy about that?
Absolutely. Delighted.
This is a disaster.
No, this is not a disaster.
It is, you know?
An earthquake is a disaster. Your grandmother having Alzheimer's so bad she doesn't even know who the fuck I am, that's a disaster. This is a good thing. This is a blessing.
I had a vision for how my life would go and this definitely is not it.
Wait. Are you living your vision right now?
I am kinda living my vision, yeah.
Well, that is sad, I'm telling you. Life doesn't care about your vision. Okay?
Okay.
Stuff happens. You just got to deal with it. Roll with it. That's the beauty of it all.
I just don't get how I tell the kid not to do drugs when I do drugs. I'll feel like a hypocrite.
Well you remember what I told you? When you were a teenager?
What did you say?
I said, "No pill, no powders."
That's right, that's right.
Right. If it grows in the ground, it's probably okay.
I guess it worked. You told me not to smoke pot all those years. And then I found out you were smoking pot that whole time.
Not the whole time. Just in the evenings and all day every weekend. Not that much.
Honestly, though, when you look at me, do you not think at all, like, you know, if he just never existed, I would have avoided a massive heap of trouble? You know?
Absolutely not. I love you totally and completely. You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
I'm the best thing that ever happened to you?
Yeah.
Now I just feel bad for you.
Hello?
Hi, Ben?
Hey Alison, how's it goin'?
Good, good. You know, I was just calling to, let you know that, I've decided to keep the baby.That's what's happening with that.
Good. That's good. That's what I was hoping you'd do. So, awesome.
Yeah, yeah, it is good.
I know we didn't plan this and neither of us really thought it was gonna happen but life is like that, you know? You can't plan for it and even if we did, life doesn't care about your plans, necessarily, and you just kinda have to go with the flow and I just know my job is to just support you in whatever it is you wanna do. I'm in, so whatever you wanna do, I'm gonna do. Alison WEEPS softly into the phone.
I'm on board. Yaaay.
I really appreciate you saying that.
No problem. I'll tell you, maybe if you could help me by telling me, like one thing that I am supposed to do, then that would be good, `cause I literally have no idea whatsoever.
I have no idea either.
Do you want to, like, get together and talk about it or something like that?
Yeah, sure.
Like a date? I mean...
Yeah.
Hi.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
No problem. Come on in. Ben leads Alison into the living room where the rest of the roommates are hanging out.
Everyone, this is Alison.
Hi.
Ally. Hey. Jason. I'm sure you remember.
Yes.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Your body's responding really well to the pregnancy.
Thank you.
It's amazing how fast the milk arrives. How's your sis?
She's good.
Oh, good. Tell her "What's up" for me.
Okay.
All right, I'm gonna go make a protein shake.
And this, uh, beautiful young man is Jonah.
Hi.
Hey.
Okay, that's Martin and Jodi over there.
Hi.
I'm gonna grab my shirt. Just take a seat if you want. Ben exits. Jonah is watching the lesbian sex scene in "Wild Things."
Just another day at the office. Do you have any acting experience?
No.
How's it goin'? You wanna toke?
Eh, no. I'm good.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Jodi.
Yeah, hi.
I heard you were pregnant.
Mm-hm.
Oh, aren't you scared? The way it's gonna come out of your...It's gonna hurt a lot I bet. Your vagina...That's so sick.
I don't know.
Are you hungry?
I'm okay right now. Thank you.
You must be angry at the baby whenever it steals your food, huh? "Oh it's mine, not yours." But, you know... Because you're family, you got to share.
Right. Jay enters the room in a towel after a shower.
Man, my balls are shaved. My pubes are trimmed. I'm ready to fuckin' rock this shit.
What the fuck, man?! If I go in there and see fuckin' pubes sprinkled on the toiled seat, I'm gonna fuckin' lose my mind! Last time I went to the bathroom, Jay, I took a shit and my shit looked like a fuckin' stuffed animal!
You're embarrassing me in company!
You embarrass yourself!
Oh, great. I hope you have a great evening! Jay exits. Ben enters in his new shirt.
All right. Let's go. See you guys later.
The funny thing is I really had never even thought about having a baby.
Yeah.
If this hadn't happened, I don't think I would have wanted to have a baby for, like, I don't know, at least ten years.
At least! God, honestly, I just got used to the notion that someone would even have sex with me. I didn't think this would happen.
Get ready. This will be coming out of you in seven months. This is exactly what our baby will look like.
It's a beautiful picture, Ben.
It is. It's not bad.  Hello, Mommy. Our baby's gonna be French Canadian. I like that.
With a little hint of Spanish.
Exactly, I'm not good with accents.
Baby books.
Awesome.
"What to Expect When You're Expecting."
What can we expect?
Well, you can't eat sushi. You can't smoke. You can't smoke marijuana. You can't smoke crack. And you can't jump on trampolines. This is basically a giant list of things you can't do.
It sounds thrilling.
I'm gonna be sitting there on the trampoline smoking crack. And you're not gonna have anything to do. You're gonna be bored. But I can't wait to read these, honestly. I put these in front of my toilet, though, they'll be read by tomorrow morning. Do you want me to get you that?
Yeah, thank you.
No problem. These are heavy.
So what do you think? Should we have sex tonight?
Ugh. Sounds awful. I'm just really constipated. Do you really want to?
Well, now.
Shut up.
That's pretty crazy how your sister's pregnant.
We have to help her.
I think they'll be fine. They'll work it...Look at us. It happened to us.
We'll help her raise the baby.
Well...fuck!
At least we don't have to use a condom, you know? Alison pulls away. BEN But we can. I brought some just in case. I don't have V.D. or anything. I mean, I don't, I thought--
It's not that.
It's just I thought we could get a little...fun out of your situation, you know?
Okay, first of all, it's not my situation. It's our situation.
I know that.
And just because I'm pregnant, I'm not some ruined woman and all romance goes out the door.
I'm sorry. I like you a lot. That's all this is.
I like you, too.
Sweet.
A little, so far. I mean, we have seven months before the baby comes. We don't have to rush it.
Yeah.
We should really just try to get to know each other and...give this a real shot. You know? We got ourselves into this situation. We kind of have to.
For the baby, right?
Exactly. Okay, if this was our second date, what would you do?
B.J. If I'm just being honest. I told my roommates that I thought I was gonna get a B.J., so...
You know what? For the sake of getting to know one another, can you not talk like that?
I can do that. I'm really nervous.
I'm nervous, too. I'm really nervous.
Yeah. Ben and Alison kiss.
You're a sweet guy, right?
I think I am.
Don't fuck me over, okay?
I wouldn't do that. Just so you know, I'm the guy girls fuck over. I'm that guy. So you don't fuck me over, okay?
Okay.
I couldn't take it. I can't raise this baby alone.
Who's he?
I'm Ben Stone.
He's my boyfriend.
That's nice.
I never met him before.
He's a new boyfriend.
But a boyfriend.
So he came over for breakfast because he's your new boyfriend?
He came from his house, drove over to our house because he thought it would be fun to have breakfast with us, so he drove his car from his house to our house to have breakfast.
Because he likes breakfast so much.
I love breakfast.
You guys wanna hear something neat? We're gonna have a baby together.
What?
Yeah, a baby.
Well, you're not married. Aren't you supposed to be married to have a baby?
You don't have to be.
But they should be because they love each other and people who love each other get married and have babies.
Where do babies come from?
Where do you think they come from?
Well, I think a stork, he drops it down, and then, a hole goes in your body and there's blood everywhere, coming out of your head, and then you push your belly-button, and then your butt falls off and then you hold you butt and you have to dig and you find a little baby.
That's exactly right.
Feed the teddy bear.
I feed your bear the grass? Know what your bear would also like to do with some grass? Smoke it. Allison and Debbie watch Ben and the kids from the patio.
Fetch. All right, bring it back.
Go get it! Fetch!
All right!
I don't wanna play this anymore.
Bring it back.
That means he has bad genes. Your kid is going to be overweight.
Shit.
I'm gonna get you! Ben chases the girls on top of the trampoline.
I'm gonna get you! Whoa! Ben falls off the trampoline onto the grass. The kids love it.
They seem to love bubbles.
They go ape-shit over bubbles.
They're really going ape-shit.
That's an incredible thing about a child. What's so great about bubbles?
They float. You can pop them. I mean, I get it. I get it.
I wish I liked anything as much as my kids like bubbles.
That's sad.
It's totally sad. Their smiling faces just point out your inability to enjoy anything.
Am I going to be okay, man?
Who knows? Is anybody okay? I'm not okay. You're asking the wrong guy. Just don't ask me to lend you any money, you know?
Can I just have some?
No.
I have fifteen years of tennis lessons.
And twelve years of sucking dick lessons.
I can't ref the next games, by the way. I got to go meet gynecologists with Alison. She doesn't like her gynecologist.
You think she likes you?
She's trying to.
She's entertaining the idea of liking you.
Exactly. I'll take that.
Wll, see she's bringing you to the gynechiatrist. She must like you.
That's pretty good, I think.
You know who I'd like to get pregnant is that Felicity Huffman, man. Ever since "Transamerica," I can't get her out of my mind.
Guys, I hate to crack the whip, but it's kind of, uh, business meeting time. I need moolah. When do you think we can launch this site?
Geez.
You can't rush this. You know what happens to these sites when they go up and they don't function well? They die.
Seriously, guys, let's say I want to launch today. Let's start... let's use that as a jumping off point. Let's make this happen. What can we do?
Look, man, I didn't go to Yale so I could work twelve hours a day.
I thought you went to Santa Monica City College.
I went where I went, Jason.
I'm not asking you to work twelve hours a day. I mean, you guys watch movies without nudity in them.
I'll tell you what, man. We could probably get it online in three months.
Thank you. Yes! Three months.
Come on, Jason! Jason serves the ball and Jonah hits it as hard as he can to win the game.
Fuck off!
Yeah, well, you still have a little dick, Cartman.
Do you smoke cigarettes?
No.
Do you smoke cigarettes?
I have on occasion.
On occasion? When? When was the last time you had one cig? You know, on, you know, a little...I need to know or I will not be your doctor.
How ya doing?
I'm breathing like James Gandolfini over here. A person next to them peddles extremely fast.
 Slow down, man. You're making me look like a jackass.
How long you kids been married?
We're not.
No.
You're single?
She's not single. She's just not married.
Are you two together? Alison and Ben share a look of disbelief that the doctor is hitting on her.
Hey, you wanna trade boyfriends? Just kidding. Kind of.
Wow. That is not your vagina. That's your asshole. That happens about five times a day.
Are you sure you don't want to come paint-balling?
Have fun, guys. Seriously, watch the eyes.
All right.
See ya, Ally.
Peace.
Bye. Alison looks at Ben.
I don't want to go. I swear to God. I want to see "Breathless" at the LACMA.
Boobs! Boobs! Boobs! Ben runs in.
Hold on, pause it, pause it, pause it.
Boobs and bush. Ben hops on the couch the log the scene for the website.
Good boobs.
Those are good ones! We're like thirty- five seconds in.
Right over the beginning credits.
Nice. Credit bush. You never get opening-credit bush.
I know. That's so crazy.
You got me. You got me.
How many doctors are there in your practice? Just because I'm sort of looking for a more personal experience. I want to make sure that you're my doctor on the day and...
I understand. We have three other doctors in the practice but I'm your man, okay? I don't take vacations. I hate Hawaii. I went to the Caribbean when I was fourteen and I'm never going back.
I feel really good about this.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, my God. Are you serious right now?
You look relieved.
I am very relieved.
All right.
I can't imagine meeting and more of you people.
You're being dramatic. We didn't meet that many.
Ooh. Do they know?
Pardon?
The belly.
The doughnuts, they call to me.
Jill walks by.
Hey, Alison!
Hi.
Great job.
Thanks.
You're pregnant aren't you?
What?
I mean, you've put on like eight pounds, nine. It's all in your uterus.
Oh, shit. I haven't told them. Do you think they're gonna be mad? I'm really chickening out about this.
It's okay. We can hide this. We'll dress you in black and we'll emphasize your boobs.
Awesome.
Your boobs are going to be big. And then they're going to be like scary big. But then they'll go down. And then they'll stay down.
Just don't say anything, okay? Please don't say anything.
I won't. Just tell them. They'll be cool. Everybody loves somebody pregnant.
Ooh. Did you see this sex offender website? These are all the sex offenders in our neighborhood. Debbie points to the screen which has a map with red dots spread over it.
Looks like your computer has chicken pox.
Those are sex offenders. These people live in our neighborhood.
We'll skip their houses when we're trick or treating. What do you want me to do? Form a posse?
You shouldn't take it so lightly.
I don't take it lightly. I'm not going to go over to any of these people's houses and say, "Hey, you mind? Can you baby sit?"
If I didn't care about these things, you wouldn't care about anything. Care more.
You're so concerned with stuff, like don't get them vaccinated, don't let them eat fish. There's mercury in the water. Jesus, how much "Dateline NBC" can you watch?
I know we're supposed to be nice with each other right now, but I'm having a really hard time. I'm struggling with it right now.
What am I doing?
Because I want to rip your fucking head off because you're so fucking stupid! This is scary.
These are our children. You fucking dipshit!
I literally am at a point where I don't know what I can say.
So I'm the bad guy because I'm trying to protect our kids from child molesters and mercury? And you're cool because you don't give a shit?
Yeah.
Yeah? Is that it?
Pretty much.
God, you're an asshole.
Don't do this in front of Ben.
I don't give a shit about Ben.
Sorry, Ben.
It's okay. I didn't think she did, anyway. Alison enters.
Okay, come on! Let's go.
I can't go. This band is doing a showcase out in the Valley. I got to go.
It's Saturday.
I got to go.
You don't want to know the sex of the baby? That's no fun.
Ben knows, but I've sworn him to secrecy.
I'll get it out of him. Ben are looks at Baby Bjorn baby carriers. He brings ones to Alison.
Hey. Think we'll ever be as happy as Baby Bjorn couple is?
We are that happy.
Yeah. You look happy.
Which is awesome. Because I never like guys like you. It's great.
You keep saying that. I know. Alison and Ben walk over to Debbie who is in front of a crib.
This is it. This is perfect.
Nice. Ben looks at the price tag.
Holy shit, it's fourteen hundred bucks.
No. You need your own crib.
There's one of these in an alley behind my house. We could just grab that. Just rub Purell all over it.
You know what? Let me buy it. I need to get you a baby present anyway, and I would love to get it for you.
No.
I'm serious. I want to.
No. It's too much.
 Shh. Yes. We'll take it obviously. I mean don't insult the woman. She wants to get us a gift.
Right.
Want to buy me some new clothes? What else can I squeeze out of you?
It's so hot in the Valley.
Hey!
Oh, my God!
Oh, shit.
Alison!
Hi!
Oh, it's so good to see you.
You too. Oh, my God.
We've been watching you on E! It's the coolest thing.
Yeah, it's been super-exciting, just crazy busy. I'm so sorry I haven't called.
Oh, it's fine.
This is my friend, Ben.
I'm Ben.
I went to school with Alison.
So, okay, so is Debbie having another baby?
No. Alison is.
What?! I just saw you a couple months ago. You're pregnant?
It was a big surprise.
It's a really funny story, actually, if you guys, if you got a second to hear it.
It's not really funny.
Tell us.
It's not funny.
Let them be the judge, okay? I think it's funny.
All right.
You know they say don't drink and drive?
Right.
Don't drink and bone!
Wow.
Yeah, she was acting weird and I really think it's just because I haven't made an honest woman out of her. She's carrying my bastard child. No one wants that.
That's what I did. I married Debbie when she got pregnant.
You think she's, like, hiding me? Like, she's, like, embarrassed by me or something like that?
Probably. I'd hide you.
How much do wedding rings cost?
It really depends, you know? I think you're supposed to spend three months pay on a ring.
That'll be easy. I don't make any money.
Really? I thought there was a lot of money in porn.
God, it's not porn? All we do is we show you what nude scenes are in what movies.
Like Mister Skin?
Who's Mister Skin?
Dude, Mister Skin. Pete imitates the Mister Skin logo smile.
We've wasted fourteen months of our lives.
This is exactly the same as our site. How the fuck did this happen?
Mister Skin! That's even a better name than ours!
Well, fuck me in the beard.
Dude, they got the top ten group shower scenes! Why didn't you think of that, Jay!
Don't put this on me!
God damn it!
Well shit. I saw it online at one point, but I guess I didn't connect the dots.
What are we gonna do now?
All we need to do is think of a new, better idea that no one else has thought of already.
"Spiderman Three" starts in eight minutes.
Shit. Don't worry. We'll figure it out. Jonah, Jason and Martin exit. Ben and Jay sit at the desk.
You know what? Just because this site exists doesn't mean ours won't work. Good things come in pairs.
For sure.
"Volcano," "Dante's Peak." "Deep Impact," "Armageddon." "Wyatt Earp," "Tombstone."
Panda Express, Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.
Exactly. We can work together. This helps us, if anything.
We're golden.
Alison, I'm sure this isn't how you pictured it being exactly and it's not how I wanted it. That is why I'm presenting you with this empty box. It's a promise, Alison. A promise that one day I will fill this with a ring that you deserve, a beautiful ring. I can't afford it yet. I've picked it out, though. It's at De Beers and it's really nice. So, basically, I'm asking you, will you marry me? Because I'm in love with you.
I love you too.
Really? That's so nice to hear. That's the first time a girl's ever said that to me.
But here's the thing.
There's a thing?
I don't really know yet what that love means. It's so new and it's so exciting. It's great. I don't know. We've only known each other for seventeen weeks.
Look, I thought you felt weird that we're having a baby and we're not engaged. I'm going to get off my knee. It hurts. Ben sits next to Alison on the bed.
I'm okay with that. We're just doing what we can. I don't want us to put any more pressure on ourselves than we have.
That makes sense.
I didn't hurt your feelings, did I?
No. I just wanted to do right by you. If you don't want to, that's totally cool.
I really do love you.
I know. Thanks. You mentioned that. It's nice.
Ben proposed to me. He did. It was really sweet. I feel a little bad. He was wearing this great button-down. He tucked it in. He got down on one knee. He didn't have an actual ring, though, just an empty box but he had this whole spiel about when he has the money, he'll buy me the ring I deserve.
The box was empty?
He can't afford a ring.
So he got down on one knee and gave you an empty box?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Get over it. If you'd been there, you would have cried.
You need to train him. Oprah said that when two people meet they should point out each other's differences and flaws.
I thought you should love people for who they are.
You criticize them a lot, so they get so down on themselves they have to change.
You don't think that's naggy?
In the end, they thank you for it.
You can't commit to him. You don't even know him. I don't even know Pete after ten years. I don't know what he's up to. He's miserable.
Why do you say that?
I think he's cheating on me. He's always going to business meetings at odd hours. Then I try to call him on his cell phone and he says he's in bad cell phone reception areas when he's in good reception areas.
Maybe he's working late. Maybe he's trying to sign a new band. I can't imagine Pete doing that.
There's no part of you that thinks maybe he's a dirty little scumbag?
No.
I think he might be.
"Memory Spy Web Memory Software. Locate history, files, websites visited, hidden downloads, e-mail history. Memory Spy." Let's see you hide from me now, little man. Alison is disturbed by this whole ordeal.
You're not going to tell them?
No. I don't have to. It's illegal for them to fire me over it. And I get three months maternity leave if I stay. So I'm not going to tell them.
Good plan.
I like it.
It's a good plan until her water breaks over Robert De Niro's shoes. (impersonating Robert De
My shoes. There's baby goo on them.
(impersonating Robert De
These shoes? On these shoes? Did you puke on my shoes?
(impersonating Robert De
Is your water on my shoes?
 Isn't it weird, though, when you have a kid and all your dreams and hopes go right out the window.
What changed for you? What went out the window? You do everything exactly the same.
No, I love what I'm doing. But say before you're married with children you want to live in India for a year. You can do it.
You want to go to India? Go to India! Seriously.
Do you want to go to India?
No. You can go.
I get what he means. Honestly, when I found out about... Ben motions towards Alison.
...I had this flash of me in a white Ford Bronco hauling ass for Canada. The chopper's taping it, and I bust through the border and I'm free! I kept thinking that. Alison stares at Ben.
It was a flash!
What do you mean?
Don't look at me. We can talk about our fears here. If Doc Brown screeched up to you in the DeLorean and said, "Alison, I got the car here. What do you want to do?" No part of you would think, "Maybe I'll go back to that night and put a condom on Ben's dick?" You never got that flash?
No. What are you talking about?
"Where we're going, we don't need roads."
You wouldn't do that?
I don't know who Doc Brown is. What are you talking about?
Doc Brown is Christopher Lloyd. He invented the DeLorean time machine.
Everyone has a time machine image.
I have a really good idea. Why don't you two get in your time machine, go back in time and fuck each other?
Who needs a time machine? Ben holds up his drink.
This is my time machine!
This is fun! We should do this more. This is the most fun I've had in a really long time.
Come on, harder.
I can't.
Why? Just do it deeper.
I can't.
Why?
I'll poke the baby if I go deeper.
Just do it!
Please don't yell at me.
The doctor and Debbie said it's fine. Come on! Ben stops.
I'm sorry, can we change positions? I'm going to crush the baby.
That's ridiculous!
No, it's not. It has no shell.
Millions of people have sex when they're pregnant! It just works!
I weigh over 200 pounds.
Just get over it.
I can't do it. Can you just get on top? All I can see if our baby, poked in the face by my penis.
Trust me, you're not even close. Okay, fine. Alison moves on top. Alison abruptly stops.
I can't do this. I can't focus like this. I look disgusting from this angle. I can feel you looking at my chins.
You look beautiful. Your chin looks so skinny.
And my boobs are all like, squishy and they're flopping around. I can feel it and it's distracting. It's all National Geographic.
No. I do not want you to fuck me like a dog.
I'm not fucking you like a dog. It's doggie style. It's just the style. I'm, it's not like a dog. We don't have to go outside or anything. Ben and Alison lie down side by side, Ben is behind.
Here we go. Is it good?
Yeah.
Should I go slower?
Harder.
Just tell me when you're close.
Just go harder.
Okay.
Keep going! Ben recoils.
Oh, God. Oh, fuck!
What happened?
The baby. It kicked my hand.
It always kicks.
No, no, no, no, no.
It's fine.
Not like this. No, this was a warning kick.
Just keep going.
This was a bad kick.
It's fine! It's fine!
Look. My dick must be like an inch away from its face and it's coming, just coming in at its face. What if it kicked because it didn't like it? I can't do that to our baby. That's the first thing it's going to see.
What are you talking about?
It's having the baby between us, it just makes it weird. I'm sorry. It just freaks me out a bit. It's a little weird.
I have totally lost it now.
You've totally lost it?
I've lost it.
Okay.
Great, you know what? Just forget it. Alison turns her back to Ben and gets settled to sleep.
 Don't worry. I won't make you do this again.
Shit.
Ben?
Fuck me. Jay runs through the room towards the front door.
Oh my God! It's the Russians. Martin carries Jodi out.
Jodi! I'll protect you! Ben clutches his bong and runs to the door. Alison runs to the door as well.
Ben!
Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, no!
That was horrible! That was so horrible.
You're fine, man.
When will it be light out?
Take it easy.
When will it be light out?
Did anybody turn off the gas?
I didn't do it.
Oh, motherfucker. Jason runs back to the house.
Martin, this is my friend, Alex. She's a pretty incredible person.
Nice to meet you. Martin holds out his hand to shake Alex's. She removes one hand from covering her breast to shake his hand. Jonah immediately covers her breast with his hand.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dude! Not cool, Martin.
That's, that wasn't...
Hey, are you serious, Howard Hughes?
What happened?
Nothing. Nothing happened. Come on.
Look, I forgot you were sleeping over. I'm sorry okay?
Yeah, because you were getting high off your huge bong. How am I supposed to be comfortable with the idea that you can take care of me and the baby if you are always getting high?
You want me to stop smoking pot because there's an earthquake once every ten years? That makes no sense, Alison. You're being irrational. Just relax. We're all scared. Oh, shit, the cops. A cop car rolls by. Ben throws his bong behind him and it SHATTERS on the payment.
California. Hey!
You know it's times like this I'm glad I don't own nice things. It's a big mess, but there's only like fifty bucks worth of shit here. That's kind of the good thing. You know, my dad told me, "Don't move to Northridge." But you figure, what are the chances of that happening twice, you know? Alison picks up a huge sword.
What is this?
It's a ninja weapon. I hope this place doesn't get condemned. That would suck. Alison finds a shopping bag with the baby books they bought. None of them have been read. Alison sadly puts them back without Ben noticing.
Hello?
Hey it's me.
You!
Hi! So, listen. Will you do me a big favor? Debbie wants us to come over and have dinner tonight. She thinks Pete is cheating on her.
Really?
Yeah. Well, she saw one of his e-mails and there's an address. Ugh.
Oh, man. I don't want to do that.
Ben, come on.
He's not cheating on her.
How do you know?
I just know.
Are you sure?
I'm one hundred percent sure he's not cheating.
Are you really?
No. It actually kind of makes sense that he would cheat.
Why?
Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and Pete's awesome?
Well, why don't you just come over then, and, we'll just diffuse the situation a little?
I'm just saying the music industry is different now. Steely Dan would never even have a chance.
Well, maybe it's because Steely Dan gargles my balls.
They're incredible.
They really aren't good, man.
Old Steely Dan.
If I ever listen to Steely Dan, I want you to slice my head off with an Al Jarreau LP.
I should get going. I'm supposed to see this band tonight in Hollywood. Actually, they're playing in Laurel Canyon, so I'll call you because the reception's terrible over there.
That's true.
And I don't want you to worry. I'm just going to jump in the shower. It would be terrible if I smelled worse than the band.
Okay. Have fun. Ben exits.
You guys are crazy. He's acting totally normal and hilarious.
No. I don't think so.
Oh, great.
Looks like no one's home.
Why was the door unlocked? Wait here.
I just feel bad for Pete.
What?
I feel like this isn't a good way to get caught cheating, it shouldn't be like this.
Well, maybe he should have thought of that before he was cheating.
 Pete!
Stop it.
I coughed. What do you want from me? Debbie checks upstairs.
There's nobody up there.
Thank you.
I guess I was wrong.
I told you. Can we get out of here, please?
Yeah, come on. Let's go. A MURMUR comes from a far room.
Did you hear that?
What?
I didn't hear anything.
Come on. Debbie leads them into a room, where Pet sits with a lot of GUYS dressed in baseball clothing.
Carlos Delgado.
Oh shit!
Hideki Matsui.
Sorry, Charlie.
What is this?
Debbie.
What the fuck is this?
It's our fantasy baseball draft.
Your fantasy what?
It's, it's our draft...for fantasy baseball. I told you all about this. Got Matsui. Debbie turns and walks out of the room.
Aw, shit.
I should have told you.
What else have you been lying about?
Nothing.
Where were you on Wednesday?
I'm going to be honest with you.
That would be a good idea.
You've been mad because I've been working so much and I didn't want to upset you.
I wouldn't be mad.
You would be.
I don't get mad.
It's a fantasy baseball draft. I'm not cheating or anything.
No, this is worse.
How is this worse?
This is you wanting to be with your friends more than your family.
Look, the reason I make that up is because if I told you what I was really doing, you would just get mad. So, you think I'm seeing a band, I do my fantasy draft, and it's win/win.
Well, what did you do last Wednesday night when you said you went to see a band?
I went to the movies.
With who?
By myself.
What'd you see?
"Spiderman Three."
Why do you want to go by yourself? Why didn't you ask me to go?
Because I needed to get away, you know? With work and you and the kids, sometimes I just need some time to myself.
I need time for myself. I want time for myself, too. Debbie holds back tears.
You're not the only one.
It's not that big of a deal.
Okay, so let's see "Spiderman Three" next week.
I don't want to go see it now.
Well...
I don't want to have to ask you to ask me. I want you to just come up with it on your own.
What? I don't even know what to say. Uh, what do you want me to do?
You just think because you don't yell that you're not mean, but this is mean.
I'm not being mean. I'm being honest. You're telling me I need to be honest.
No, you're not. You're lying.
I'm doing it because I need to keep my sanity a little bit.
You know what? I don't want you at the house anymore. Okay?
Come on. Debbie heads for the car.
Oh, shit, she's coming back.
How come we go to the gynecologist so often? I bet we have to go so much so we can pay for that three-hundred- thousand-dollar machine he has.
I cannot stop thinking about what an asshole Pete is.
That's a little strong, I would say.
Really? Because that had to be one of the most selfish things I've ever witnessed.
It's understandable. I even think it's kind of funny.
What's funny about it?
Well, you won't laugh now, I wouldn't imagine, but you know, the situation.
We break into this stranger's house thinking we're going to find him sleeping with a woman, and then it's a bunch of nerds playing fantasy baseball.If you saw that on television, you would laugh.
Is that what you think?
Yeah.
Is that what you want to do, Ben?
I don't even like baseball. I'm just saying when you're a guy and you have a family and you have responsibility, you lose that male camaraderie, and I get that. I totally understand where he's coming from.
Why do you guys always go to that place? You miss male camaraderie. What do I give a shit? Go hang out with your bearded freak friends. I don't care. You want to hang out with guys that look like the Shoe Bomber, it's all on you, man.
Well what the fuck am I supposed to say to that?
You should just support me! You know, you should just support everything I say because at this juncture in my life, I'm allowed to be wrong!
So if you're wrong, I have to support it?
Yes!
I can't tell you that you're acting like a lunatic?
Oh, that's helpful. You have to do nothing!
I've sacrificed a lot of shit to this!
You are just fucking sitting there! You haven't sacrificed anything!
I have.
I've had to sacrifice my job, my body, my youth, my vagina!
You've sacrificed your vagina?
Yes! It will never look the same after this!
Well. Fine. I'll pay for vaginal reconstructive surgery.
You can't pay for shit! You can barely buy spaghetti.
You're right. Fine!
You know what? Get out of the car.
Oh! You know what? Why don't you not threaten me?!
You should just get out of the fucking car.
I'm not going to get out of the car in the middle of nowhere! No!
Get out of the car.
No!
I own this car! Get out of my car!
No.
Get out of my car!
No.
Can you let me back in the car, please? Have you calmed down? Did you take a breath? I have no clue where we are! Alison just glares at him.
Fine. Go. Great. Alison drives off.
You know what? Maybe I should take my shoes off. Or my belt buckle. My belt buckle's huge.
Why don't you take off your earrings, too? They weigh about eighty pounds. They're made out of moon rocks aren't they?
Do not make fun of me. Okay? I am hormonal, I am terrified, and I am falling apart, so stop treating everything like it's a big joke!
I'm sorry you're freaking out, but I just walked three fucking miles through Koreatown to get here. Sorry if I'm trying to lighten the mood a little. The Nurse leaves.
Well, don't! Okay?! You can't take anything seriously! You didn't even read the baby books.
I didn't read the baby books! What's gonna happen? How did anyone ever give birth without a baby book?!
That's right, the ancient Egyptians fucking engraved "What to Expect When You're Expecting" on the pyramid walls! I forgot about that! Who gives a flying fuck about the baby books?!
It just shows your lack of commitment, Ben! That you're not in this with me!
Did you just say my lack of commitment? Because that's what it sounded like. It almost seems as though you forgot I proposed to you like an asshole! And you said no to me!
If you feel that way, you should just go. Really. Just go. Because we didn't mean to do this together, okay? And, and we tried to make it work and that was good, I suppose. Alison holds back tears.
But it doesn't work. Because we are two completely different people. And I think it would just be easier for both of us if we stop fooling ourselves.
You know what? I know this isn't you talking, it's your hormones, but I would just like to say, "Fuck you, hormones! You are a crazy bitch, hormones! Not Alison! Hormones!" Fuck them. It's a girl. Buy some pink shit!
Nice. You are such an asshole. You know what? Go fuck your fucking bong, you fuck!
I will fuck my bong. Doggie-style, for once. Ben exits while giving Alison the finger as her walks away. Dr. Howard's Nurse returns.
I'm really sorry about all that. That was really inappropriate.
I don't feel so stupid, then.
I totally know what you're talking about, man. If I wrote out the list of shit Alison doesn't let me do it would be endless. Don't smoke pot. Don't have samurai swords in your room. Don't have illegal grow operations in the house. I could go on all fucking day. Have I told her to stop doing anything ever? No.
Marriage is like that show "Everybody Loves Raymond," but it's not funny. All the problems are the same, but it's... Instead of all the funny, pithy dialogue, everybody's just really pissed off and tense. Marriage is like an unfunny, tense version of "Everybody Loves Raymond," but it doesn't last twenty-two minutes. It lasts forever.
Let's get out of here, man. Honestly, let's just go. Let's go to Vegas.
Let's do it.
Yeah.
Why not?
Get up.
What?
We're not going to do this. Seriously. Debbie turns off the television.
What are you doing?
We have to do something! And have fun!
I'm just so tired.
I know you're tired. But we're going to be untired! We're going to go live!
Ugh. I hate you so much sometimes.
We're going to be positive.
How many Red Bulls have you had?
I've had about three Red Bulls in the last fifteen minutes. And I feel fabulous! We're going to create a new life and it's going to be awesome! Let's go!
Since when do we lock this fucking thing? Come on! Jason opens the door with Jonah and Jay. All of their eyes are very infected.
Yo. We can't go, dude. Sorry.
Holy crap! What happened?
We got pink eye.
What? You giving each other butterfly kisses or something?
Very funny. That's not how you get pink eye. You get it from poo particles making their way into your ocular cavities.
Hey, Ben.
Yo.
How's it going? I farted on Jason's pillow as a practical joke. He farted on Jonah's, thinking it was mine. And then eventually pink-eyes my pillow. I'm not proud of this. But, I think we've all forgiven each other. But, we can't go anywhere.
You can get pink eye from farting in a pillow?
Totally.
That's awesome.
Yeah, but you got to be bare-assed. Martin enters the doorway, his eyes are the worst.
Jesus. Martin got it bad! What, did someone take a dump right in your eye?
No. No pink eye for me. I'm just really...high.
Well stay back, guys. I got to get my suit. Ben enters the house and the guys pretend they're going to rub their faces on him. Pete stays outside.
Yeah. Jason shuts the door on Pete.
This is fun!
This is great. We're going to have the best time ever.
We make a good team, man.
Yep. It's like I can't come here with Debbie. She doesn't understand. It's like she wants to hold me in, and she was telling Alison she could train you.
She thinks she could train me?
Yeah, like you're running the Triple Crown.
She can't train this! I'm like Siegfried and Roy's Bengal. You think I'm trained. I'll bite your fucking face off.
That's right.
In front of a crowd, baby.
This is better. Besides I don't know if I have enough of these babies to go around. Pete brandishes a bag of mushrooms.
Oh, my God. Are these mushrooms?
I got them from a roadie for the Black Crowes.
I'm eating them.
Oh, no, save it! I got tickets to Cirque du Soleil.
You do?! No you don't.
I swear to God, man.
Holy shit!
I see the beam of light.
There it is, baby.
Woo-hoo. You're so money that you don't even know how much money you have.
I love Vegas, man.
This is the greatest place on earth.
It's really amazing here. The stripper straddles Pete and pulls his tie through her legs so that he face is pulled against her butt.
Whoa. You got my tie. This is awesome.
Now that's how you get pink eye.
 Hey, what's up, baby girl? Debbie and Alison move up to the doorman.
Hi.
What's up? End of the line, please.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
Look, we're at capacity, okay? We'll let some people in when it clears out a little. You'll get right in if you go back to the end of the line.
We come here all the time. It's not a big deal. It doesn't really look that crowded in there.
Hey, look, I don't make the rules.
Please?
No. TWO CUTE GIRLS approach. The Doorman lifts the rope for them.
Hey, what's up, shorty? What's up pretty girls? See y'all when y'all get out. Take care of yourself.
What was that? What the fuck was that?
It is what it is, sweetie. Now can you step to the back, please?
You don't need to call me sweetie.
Yeah, but maybe you should listen to your friend.
No, you don't need to call me sweetie.
All right, you want to come in, you're going to have to go to the end of the line and wait like everybody else.
I'm not going to go to the end of the fucking line. Who the fuck are you? I have just as much of a right to be here as any of these little skanky girls! What, am I not skanky enough for you?! You want me to hike up my fucking skirt?! What the fuck is your problem?! I'm not going anywhere! You're just some `roided out freak with a fucking clipboard. And your stupid little fucking rope! You may have power now, but you're not God. You're a doorman! Okay? You're a doorman! So...fuck you, you fucking fag with your fucking little faggy gloves.
Come here, come on. The Doorman takes Debbie aside.
What?
You old. She pregnant. Can't have a bunch of old, pregnant bitches running around. That's crazy. I'm only allowed to let in five percent black people. He said that. Five percent. That mean if there's twenty-five people here, I get to let in one-and-a-quarter black people. So I got to hope there's a black midget in the crowd.
Now I feel guilty. I'm sorry.
Why y'all want to be in here anyway? Y'all need to be at a yoga class or something.
Oh, God. Ugh. Debbie takes Alison away.
Have the mushrooms kicked in yet? Ben and Pete CHUCKLE uncontrollably.
This was a great idea, man.
This is the best idea I've ever had in my life. Two bare-chested male acrobats start to balance on top of each other.
What are they going to do? What in the world are they doing? If I shaved my stomach and my chest, I would look exactly like that. Those guys are at work right now. (imitating one of the
What'd you do today? Oh, just lifted my brother. The crowd starts to APPLAUD for the acrobats.
No! Don't applaud! He'll fall! I'm freaking out right now, man! Many acrobats in devilish outfits take the stage.
The mushrooms are turning on me! A clown dressed as a GIANT BABY is part of the act. Ben YELLS frantically.
Papa.
I am not your papa. A giant Snail comes out onto the stage.
I can't deal with this shit, man! Ben stands up and runs down the aisle towards the exit.
What's over?
My youth.
Don't say that.
It's true. I just want to dance. I love dancing.
So dance.
I can't dance. I'm embarrassed.
I should be embarrassed. I'm a fucking whale and I'm trying to get into some stupid club and--
You look beautiful. You're young and you're tall and you got the good lips and boobs. I'm going to be alone.
Debbie, no, you're not.
Yes, I am. Oh, God! Fucking, men! I get worse looking and he gets better looking, and it's so fucking unfair. Oh, fuck. We should go. My babysitter always gets mad when we come home past twelve. She's such a pissy little high- school cunt.
This isn't funny. That guy has twelve kids. It's not funny. This is sick. This is a sick movie. That's a lot of responsibility to be joking about. That's not funny. I got to turn this off. It's freaking me out. Pete moves several chairs into the bedroom.
There are five different types of chairs in this hotel room.
Holy fuck. What are they all doing in here?
These are five different types of chair.
Get them out of here, man. This is too many chairs for one room.
There's a guy that works for this hotel. His whole job is to find chairs. Pete moves to a tall chair.
Look at this one. Look at it. It's gold and red and it's kind of shiny. Shiny thread? Unbelievable. It is beautiful, and it feels amazing.
The tall one's gawking at me and the short one's being very droll. I don't like them. Pete switches to another chair.
Oh, wow!
It's weird that chairs even exist when you're not sitting on them. Pete switched to another tall chair.
I'm up high! I'm really high up.
I should've read the baby books.
Why didn't you read the baby books?
Because then it's real, you know?
Dude, it's real whether or not you read those books. That baby's coming. Pete sits on another chair.
Oh, man!
Think they'll take us back?
Yes. But I don't know why. Do you ever wonder how somebody could even like you?
All the time, man. Like every day. I wonder how you like me.
How can Debbie like me? She likes me. I mean, she loves me. The biggest problem in our marriage is that she wants me around. She loves me so much that she wants me around all the time. That's our biggest problem. And I can't even accept that? Uh, like that upsets me?! Ben sits up from the bed.
What?
She's the one. She loves me.
You can't believe...that people love you? I love you, man! Debbie loves you!
I don't think I can accept her love. There's something wrong with me.
You can't accept love?
I don't know what it is.
Love? The most beautiful, shiny, warmy thing in the world? You can't accept it?
I have to go to this other chair.
Oh, this is a better energy.
You can't accept pure love? You can't accept Debbie? She's chosen to give you her life. She's picked you as her life partner! But you play fantasy baseball because you can't accept her love? Ben BURPS.
Ugh. I could accept it, man. And Debbie's amazing, man. She's cool and she's funny and she smells good and she's nice and her hair always looks different. She's too good for you, man. Pete shoves his hand in his mouth.
Tastes like a rainbow.
You're disgusting. You're an urchin. And she busts your balls because you're a little bitch! You're a filthy bitch! And I'd bust your balls! Debbie wants to give her life to you and Alison doesn't want to do that with me. And it makes me sad all day. I want to go home.
 I want to go home, too.
Everything looks beautiful.
Thanks. I went kind of overboard, huh?
No, it's great.
Your daughter only turns eight once. Is Ben going to come?
I don't think so. I don't know why he would.
Oh, hey, what up dog?
Where have you been?
Around. You know, just kind of doing my thing.
Why is everybody so mad at you?
I don't know. Are they mad? What have they been saying?
They've been saying, like "blah-blah- blah-blah. Ben's a prick."
They said that?
A lot.
That sucks.
What does it mean?
Penis. It means penis.
Oh.
Babe, we're running low on plates.
What's happening, man?
Hey, Ben.
Hey, Debbie.
How are you?
Good. How are you? Ben and Debbie kiss hello.
Hi.
I just got yellow cupcakes.
I thought I said to get pink cupcakes.
I can run out. I'll get some more.
Nah, it's no big deal.
I don't mind.
No it doesn't matter.
You sure?
Yeah. You look really cute in that. Pete and Debbie kiss. Debbie exits.
Well, that was fast, you pussy.
You're the one that got dressed up like a cholo on Easter to come to this party.
How are things at Butt-Fucking-Ham Palace?
You look like Babe Ruth's gay brother, Gabe Ruth.
Well played, sir. That was good.
You going to talk to Alison?
Yeah, I was about to.
Right on. Ben hands Pete his gift for Sadie.
It's a doll.
Thanks, Ben.
I just don't think we can make it work.
We can get back on track and everything's going to be great.
You're just being nice. And I'm being nice and just because we're two nice people doesn't mean we should stay together. I don't want this baby to determine the rest of our lives. You know? Me not wanting to do this alone isn't enough of a reason to drag you into a relationship with me. It's just not fair. And, and don't repeat this, but, God, I don't want to end up like Debbie.
But Debbie's happy.
She's happy today. But every day is a constant struggle for them because they're not right for each other. You know? And they have to force it and I don't want us to have to do that. I don't want to force you to be what I think you should be. That's wrong of me because you're great. You really are. You're great the way you are and, I mean, you like to get high and you like to do shrooms in Vegas.
I didn't do shrooms in Vegas.
And who am I to stop you? Who am I to tell you that that's wrong? It's not wrong. It's who you are. It's what you enjoy and that's your life and...
I'm not that guy anymore.
We can be friends. And you can be there when the baby is born, and in the baby's life as much as you want. I hope you will be.
If you give me a shot to just show you that I'm con-- Debbie approaches.
Excuse me?
Oh, shit.
Yeah.
It's okay.
I'll be right back. We'll finish talking.
What happened?
Thanks for warning me, man. I just walking into a fucking buzz saw! She rejected me! Because you, for some insane reason, told Debbie that I did mushrooms with you in Vegas! She gets mad because I smoke pot!
Now I'm upping it to fucking psychedelics! Thanks!
Really? I thought that she'd take you back.
You know why she just rejected me? Because you're such a shitty husband, she thinks I'm going to turn into a shitty husband! Ben exits. Pete starts to carry the cake to the backyard.
When are you due?
I got two months.
Really? Wow. Well, you're so big already.
Yeah. Alison interviews ANDY DICK.
When is that baby popping out?
I got two months to go.
Really? Are you dilated yet? Andy tries to stick his hand up Alison's dress.
Wow, wow. Alison interviews EVA MENDES.
You look fantastic.
Thanks, thanks.
Are you going to, like, give birth right now? Alison interviews STEVE CARELL.
Wow! You're about to drop any second.
You know what?
I love your broach here.
You don't need to lie to me. I don't appreciate it. I know I look like a fat cow. And I'm sweating profusely.
No, you don't look like a...fat cow at all. You look great. So, I have to get going in. They're calling me.
Steve, hey! Help me out. Give me an interview, please.
Well, I just need to run in. Steve starts to pull away.
You know what? Just say into the camera, "You're watching E! Entertainment." Just give me that.
Congratulations.
No, Steve, don't be an asshole! Come on.
I'm not being an asshole.
Wow. You managed to turn Steve Carell into an asshole. No easy feat.
Shut up, Brent.
You screwed me, Dad, okay? You said everything was going to be fine and nothing is fine. Nothing is fine.
Ben, I've been divorced three times. Why would you listen to me?
Because you were the only one giving me advice! And it was, it was terrible advice!
You can go around blaming everyone else, but in the end, until you take responsibility for yourself, none of this is going to work out.
I don't know how to take responsibility for myself, okay? I didn't read the baby books!
You didn't read the books?
I should smoke less pot. I don't know what to do! I'm an idiot! What, tell me what to do!
I don't know. I don't know. Ben, I love ya. What can I tell ya?
Just tell me what to do.
Stone, you settling in okay?
Best job I ever had.
Like to hear it.
Alison, thank you for coming in. I don't want to shock you, but know what's under that jacket. You're pregnant, have been for a while. From my count, you're right around eight months. And I don't know why you felt you couldn't tell us.
I'm really sorry.
This is Hollywood. We don't like liars.
I just wasn't expecting this and, I didn't know how to handle it, and I didn't want to lose my job. I'm really sorry.
It's unfortunate that you didn't tell us because you would've found out that we thought it's great.
Really?
Yeah.
So, we did some research. And turns out, people like pregnant.
Oh, my God!
The bigger you are, the bigger your numbers.
I was surprised because I feel the opposite.
We're going to do a whole maternity month on "E, Exclamation, Mommy." You're going to interview all the pregnant celebs.
Really?
Yes.
Scary!
If you're pregnant, they're pregnant, you can talk about being pregnant.
It just grosses me out...when I know that people are pregnant. Because I think about the birth. Everything's so wet.
And everything that goes into it. None of the gross stuff. But you know, hopes, dreams, whatever. It's going to be great.
Oh, my God. This is such good news. Thank you so much.
You're welcome. And then, after the baby is out, tighten it back up.
Tight. And please don't lie to us again. Because maybe someday we could be friends.
Okay. I won't. I'm sorry.
I just don't like secrets.
You know, it's a rare thing that you live to see the day your wildest dreams come true. I mean what is there left to want? I get to go to Legoland.
Shut up, Pete.
Say it!
Legoland!
Don't get them all riled up before the drive.
I shouldn't have given them all that meth then.
We'll be back on Sunday.
Or Saturday. You never know. We might see it all in one day.
Sunday. Let's go.
Ow, ow, ow.
Hello?
Hey, what's up daddy? What are you doing?
Just smoking a joint, drinking some beers, you know. Rocking.
I think we're about to go to a new club. You coming?
No. I'm going to pack it in soon.
I know. I'm just tired.
No, I feel great. I like it.
No, I'm not. Okay? Thank you.
Okay, very good.
Great.
That's cool, man.
No, this is Dr. Angelo. How can I help you?
I'm a patient of Dr. Howard's and I'm going into labor and I need to speak with him.
I actually don't know where he is tonight. But I've made myself available to his patients and I'd be happy to help you.
Can you help me find him? Can you give me his number?
Oh, no. You know what? Actually, I'm under strict instructions not give out his number, but I can help you through this.
No, no, no, no. I want to speak to my own doctor. You really won't give me his number? Because this is my first baby and he promised that he would be here for me and I need you to give me his number, okay?
Dr. Howard is not available tonight. Bet everything's going to be okay, I assure you.
No, I don't want you to help me because I have no idea who you are! I want my own goddamned doctor! You make sure he calls me! Alison clicks off the phone.
Hello?
Hello?
Please be in here. Hello? Hello!
Hello? Alison. Hello?
Ben?
Alison. What is this, like a water birth? What are we doing? Should we go?
Shh! Just relax, okay? Just be mellow, because that's what this is all about. Because if it gets too stressful in here then the baby is born into a stressful environment and then he's wired for stress for the rest of his life. So just...just be calm.
I don't want to talk about it.
But maybe we could bring the baby into a reconciled place so, we can talk--
No. I don't want to go there. Don't go there, okay?
Okay.
Help me stay relaxed.
So, what should I do?
You need to call Dr. Howard. Ben goes into the hall and calls Dr. Howard's house.
Hello?
Hello, this is Ben Stone. I'm calling on behalf of Alison Scott. We need Dr. Howard. It's an emergency.
He's at San Francisco at Bar Mitzvah.
He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco? Do you know when he gets back?
In three days.
Do you have his cell number, by any chance? Ben pops his head around the corner to talk to Alison.
Great. Thank you so much. I'm so glad you're here. Thank you.
I'm glad I'm here, too. Thank you. I shouldn't have told you you were a fucking lunatic. I shouldn't have said that. I feel terrible about it.
No, it's okay. We're past it. I'm sorry I told you to fuck your bong.
It's okay. I didn't
Let's just drop it now. We're over it.
I'm going to call him right now. You're doing so great. Ben slips into the hallway and calls Dr. Howard.
Hello, it's Dr. Howard. I'm not here right now. Please leave a message.
 Hey, Doc Howard. Ben Stone calling. Guess what the fuck's up? Alison's going into labor and you are not fucking here. Now, where are you? You're at a fucking Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco, you motherfucking piece of shit! And you know I'm going to have to do now? I'm going to have to kill you. I'm going to have to pop a cap in your ass. You're dead! You're Tupac! You are fucking Biggie, you piece of shit! I hope you fucking die or drop the fucking chair and kill that fucking kid! Hope your plane crashes. Peace, fucker! Ben goes back to Alison.
Hey.
Hey.
Did you talk to him?
I didn't talk to him directly, I left him a very nice message, though. What I'm about to tell you isn't that bad. You should know that going in. We can get through this and it's just a little hiccup, but everything will be fine. Do you trust me when I say everything will be fine?
I can deal with it.
Okay. So, Dr. Howard is at a Bar Mitzvah.
A Bar Mitzvah?
It's a Jewish rite of passage. And he's going to be there for the next three days, so he will not be able to be here tonight.
It's okay. What do you think we should do?
I know exactly what to do. All we do is we'll get in the car, I'll drive to the hospital, and on the way, we will call every gynecologist we've met. Someone will be available. You know?
I can do that.
Good. We still have time. I mean, how far apart are your contractions?
I think, like, seven minutes.
Seven minutes! See? Not until four minutes is it really coming. And has your water broken, even?
I don't know. I'm in the tub.
That's a good point. Have you had, have you had your bloody show?
What's that?
It's a bloody mucusy discharge. But it only comes out right before the baby's going to come, so if that hasn't happened, we have time. We can make it to the hospital. It's no problem.
You read the baby books.
Yeah. I did. I read three of them, actually.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Wait. Are we allowed to park here?
It's okay. Ben takes a handicapped placard out of his jacket pocket and hangs it on the mirror.
I stole this from Martin's grandma.
Oh. That was really sweet of you.
Thanks.
He did. We'll take good care of you. Samuel?
Yeah?
This is Alison Scott. Please admit her into room 307.
All right. Hi.
You're our nurse?
That's why I'm holding the clipboard. So, uh, what else is up with you guys?
I'm just joking. Let's have a baby!
So, I'm sorry it took me so long to find that vein. That little guy really didn't want me to find him.
Is that the baby on that one right there? Alison points to some equipment by her bed side.
Yeah. That's how we can tell how the little guy or gal is doing.
Okay. A groggy Dr. Kuni enters.
Hello, Alison, Ben. Interesting night.
We really, really appreciate you coming, man.
What else do I have to do, I mean, besides sleep? I was only kidding. What happened to your doctor?
He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco. He didn't tell us though.
Nice.
Yeah.
Lucky for you I don't have any Jewish friends.
Dr. Kuni, I really want to do this naturally. I don't want to use drugs.
Let's just take a look and see what happens, okay? Fetal heart rate is good. Samuel, where are we?
Four centimeters.
Four centimeters what?
Dilated.
Dilated. That's right. Focus. Pay attention, okay? We're a team. Okay?
I want to get the fuck out of here.
What?
I just want to get the fuck out of here.
Just relax, man, just relax.
I don't fucking like hospitals.
Jonah, this is beautiful. I just think you need to relax and embrace the beauty of another life joining our gang. We're having a baby. We are having a baby.
I'm not having shit besides a fucking panic attack. There's probably a fucking room back there full of dead bodies! You guys want to be here when one rolls out and just fucking coughs malaria into our face?
Jesus.
Fucking shit.
Is that good?
Oh, yeah, get in there.
I could do this all day. The fetal heart monitors begins to BEEP.
What was that?
What the hell was that? Samuel hurries in to check the monitor.
What's that, what's happening? Dr. Kuni enters.
Well, boy and girls, what seems to be the problem?
Decels.
Oh, dear. Okay. Alison, I need you to turn on your back now, okay? The baby's heart rate is slowing. Okay?
It's going to be okay.  Is it going to be fine? Alison turns onto her back.
It's going to be fine. Okay?
What are you doing?
I'm turning the baby so I can take the pressure off the cord.
Oh, my God. The monitors stops beeping.
We're good. The heartbeat's stronger, but we're not out of the woods. We need to get things going now. I think the cord is wrapped around the neck. Okay?
What?
So I'm going to give you some medicine, pop the bag and get things going, okay? I don't want to leave the baby in there for long and we can give you some medicine for the pain.
No, no, no, no. I don't want the baby to be born all drugged out. It's not my birth plan.
Now, things change. We don't have time to debate this.
What? No. But no, I'm not comfortable with that. I'm not.
No. Would you please just listen to her?
Fine. Do what you want to do.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
Should I leave? Do you want to be the doctor? Because I really don't need to be here.
No. What we want is to take a second to talk about our options, okay? That's all we want.
No. You mean you want to take a second to tell me how to do my job. My job is to get that baby out safely. Or I can go home! You just let me know. You be the doctor.
Can we talk outside in the hall for a second?
That woman is a control freak, and she needs to let go and let me do my job.
Look, she's just having a hard time because her and her doctor had a very specific birth plan. And they wanted it to be a very special experience.
Okay. if you want a special experience, go to a Jimmy Buffet concert. We have a new birth plan: Get the baby out safely.
Look, man, will you help us out? I have no idea what I'm doing. You can be as big a dick to me as you want. Just be nice to her, man. That's all I ask. Just please be nice to her. Ben's stomach GROWLS loudly.
Are you okay?
I think so.
I'm sorry. Let's start fresh.
Thank you, man.
This is healthy. This is good. I think we're bonding.
Alison, I apologize for being a little brash, but if you're okay with it, it's rather important we break the bag and give you some medicine to speed things up. Because once the bag is broken, I don't want there to be an infection.
Whatever. Do what you have to do. Dr. Kuni exits.
 Oh, my God. What a nightmare that guy is.
I know, I know. Look, I talked to him. I think he'll be more cool now.
I'm so sorry I broke up with you.
You really don't need to be. And you know, I knew you'd give me another shot. I figured it'd be a lot sooner than this, you know?
I was just in such a panic from all of this. And watching Debbie and Pete together, and my ass got so fat.
No, no.
It did. I just never, for one minute, thought that the guy who got me pregnant would actually be the right guy for me.
Me neither.
I guess he is.
All right, Martin, who am I?
People think I'm smart because I speak in a robot voice.
Stephen Hawking.
I fuck my nurse with my ever-expanding cock.
Oh, fuck.
Stay down!
Jonah, you shithead!
Hi. I can't believe I go out of town and this happens.
I know.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere.
Screw Legoland.
All right, how do you want this? You want this over the shoulder? I can do whatever you want. I can get in there. Kind of Spike Lee angles.
No, you can shoot the waiting room. That would be great.
Debbie.
Why?
I'd like to be in there with Alison...without you.
Okay. I understand how you feel, but this isn't up to you.
Look, Debbie, you are high off your ass if you think you're coming into that room. If you take one step towards that door, I will tell security there's a crazy chick in a pink dress snatching up babies. Okay? So don't even try to come into that room. That's my room now. That little area with the Pepsi machine...that's your area. My room. Your area. Stay in your area. Stay out of my room. Back the fuck off.
What are you doing here?
He just kicked me out. He told me to leave. But I guess it's good, right? He said he's going to take care of her. He really seems on his game. I think he's going to be a good dad. I think I like him. Thank God.
I wish I'd gotten that on tape.
Go! Holy shit, almighty! Oh, shit, this really hurts!
Ah, I see we're well on our way.
I want the epidural! Okay? Give me the epidural!
Give it to her. Give her the epidural, okay?
Okay?
Give it to her now.
Alison, we're past the point of an epidural. The cervix is fully dilated.
No, seriously, I want an epidural! I know there's time!
We can't give you the epidural.
Take the time! I'll make sure it doesn't come out! I'll stop pushing.
We have time.
I'll stop, oh, please, please, please!
Just do it, please!
I'm sorry. We have no time. We're going to just have to do this the all natural way, okay? The way you wanted to do it. Okay? Ready?
Okay.
Here comes another contraction, okay? I want you to push. Okay, ready? Good, good, good.
I feel everything! Oh, my God! It's happening.
Maybe we can take it down just a little. I think you're going to scare the other pregnant women.
Are you fucking kidding me? Are you kidding me?
Jesus.
Oh. This is messed up. Something's wrong in there.
No, no. I mean, granted, gynecology's only a hobby of mine, but it sounds to me like she's crowning. Is that right, Deb?
Yeah. That's what it sounds like for everyone. Everyone goes through this.
No, I disagree with you. That sounds terrible. I'm going to go sneak a peek, see if there's anything I can do. Jay goes to Alison's room.
It's crowning! I'm seeing the head!
Oh, God. Honey, what does it look like, Ben? Been peers down between Alison's legs. We actually see the crowning shot as the baby's head is being pushed out of Alison's vagina.
Oh, God.
What?
You don't want to see it. You don't
No, I want to see it!
It's beautiful. You don't want to, though.
No, I want to see... A nurse holds a mirror for Alison. She sees the actual crowning shot.
...it! Oh, God! Oh, God!
Okay, we're almost home! One, two-- Jay bursts in.
You okay in here?
Jesus!
Get out!
Yeah, okay.
You all right, buddy?
One sec.
What did it look like?
I shouldn't have gone in there. Don't go in there. Promise me you don't go in there.
Me go in there? That's the last fucking place I want to go. Like I'm going to go in there. Try getting a boner now. Jason beams at Debbie.
What's up Deb?
Hey. Pete looks at Debbie.
Push. One, two, three.
Oh, God!
You've passed the shoulders. One more big push. Good. The baby comes out. Dr. Kuni cleans it up.
Oh, Ben. I did it.
You did it.
It's out.
You did it. Oh, my God, you did it. Dr. Kuni hands the baby to Alison.
Hi, baby. I love you, Ben.
I love you so much, too. Oh, my God.
Congratulations, you two. Beautiful.
Thank you.
You did so great. You were amazing.
Pretty baby.
You got out. You made it out. Welcome.
You ever get so bored you just stare at your balls?
I bet you do, late John Lennon.
Here we go again.
 Who is that? Is that Ben's rabbi? Is he the one who cuts the penis?
I think it's Matisyahu.
Awesome.
You want out of the bet?
I want out of the bet.
You know what you have to say. Just say it, man. I think now is the time.
"Jason, you're the master."
You heard it, right?
Yeah.
All right. You're out of the bet. You're done. Martin hugs Jason.
Your face smells like an old man's balls.
Thank you.
Oh, my God. Hello. My goodness. She's beautiful. She's beautiful. I love you, Ben.
I love you, Debbie.
Okay. Pete turns the camera on himself and shakes his head "no."
Hello, baby.
Gentlemen, it's a girl!
Ohhhhhhh!
Yeah!
We got a daughter! Mazel Tov!
Congratulations, Daddy!
We got a beautiful little girl!
Let's meet her! She's awesome.
A beautiful little girl!
Let's meet her. Aw.
 And then your mommy said, "Just do it, already," which was very confusing to Daddy. So I listened to the most literal translation of that and I just did it, already. What would you do? Don't tell Mommy, but it was the smartest thing I ever did, listening to her, because now you're here. Isn't that nice? I think it is.
I hope your apartment's big enough for the three of us.
It definitely is. That's why I got one in East LA. The rent. It's huge! The only thing is we have to decide if we're going to be Crips or Bloods before we get there.
Well, I look good in red.
I look good in blue. The fighting continues. We could just throw off everyone and become Latin Kings.
Yeah.
We both look good in gold.
Good choice. I would yell at you about driving so slow, except the baby's here.
No, these guys can honk all they want. I ain't going faster than twelve. It might take us around three hours to get home, though. The car moves slowly down the highway with a line of cars waiting behind them.
