Oh, mmph.
Hey Mom, heard you and Dad doing the nasty last night. Thanks for that one. By the way, who the fuck is Nancy?
Hey Dad, Mom's on the phone telling her friends that you're hung like a light switch.
Oh Daddy, there he goes. He makes the reach and... yes! Both balls at the same time! One heck of a double play!
And the sniff to finish it off.
Fucking freak show.
Do you like that nigger?   Come on nigger, do you like it?
 Oh yeah baby, I like it.
Okay, so. What was going through your mind when I called you a nigger?
This costs you an extra fifty.
I know.
Well, what did it feel like?
It felt like nothing.
What do you mean?
You ain't the first person to call me a nigger when we was fucking.
 Oh.
Johns call me nigger all the time. Especially white guys. Nothing new. Just dirty talk.
That it?
What about you? You like calling me nigger? You get your nut off?
 No.
Then why'd ya call me that?
Have you ever wondered what it was like to treat someone so completely cruel that it was unthinkable?
I was trying to do the unthinkable and unimaginable when I called you that. I wanted to see if was even possible for me to do that.
Yeah, so?
I think I want to die. Like I don't deserve to live anymore.   And that I will never want to do something like that to someone again.
Why ya wanna die?
Because everyone hates me.
They hate me because I seek beauty and appreciate destruction. They hate my mind, my thoughts, my imagination. They hate everything about me. And I hate them.
 Really?
Yep. Everyone. Everyone that knows or who has ever met me.
Your parents don't hate you. Look at this room in this big 'ole house you got.
My parents provide me with food and shelter because they have been conditioned by society into thinking it's the appropriate thing to do. In reality they can't stand to be in the same room with me. They're fascists, brainwashed, and unforgiving. 
They dismiss my feelings of ill regard towards them on simple rebelliousness of youth, but that's only because they are patently and intentionally unaware of their own hypocrisies.
 Do you understand me?
You wanna know what I think?
Yes, I really do.
I think you're a spoiled ass white boy, thinks you everything, but you don't know shit. All you do is bullshit complain and there's folks out there that'd kill for all this.
I don't feel sorry for you.
 No one is asking you to.   Thank you for letting me film you.
So Melissa talked Gary into the SL instead of the seven series. I couldn't believe it.
They paid way too much.
I strictly buy American anyway.
Where you going honey?
Bathroom.
Can we start already?
One second.
Who do you hate most in the world and why?
 Why? Who cares?
I do.
God, I just wanted to come up here to say "hi" and get away from my parents' bullshit for like two seconds and you have to put the stupid camera in my face.
Now we're onto something.
You're weird Jimmy. You were weird when we were kids and now you're just getting weirder.
Is that why you had a crush on me?
 Yeah right.
You didn't have a crush on me?
You're a loser. You're twenty one and you're still living with your parents.
I heard that you got kicked out of college because you tried to talk your roommate into killing himself.
Where'd you hear that?
From everyone.
You wanna know the truth?
Yeah.
He asked me if he should kill himself. I told him to look inside himself for the answer. I didn't tell him to. I didn't tell him not to. I said he shouldn't be afraid of the unknown. If he was going to kill himself, I wanted him to do it for the right reasons.
I swear to God, you're a fucking psycho.
Like you're normal.
More than you.
If I'm such a freak, what are you doing in my room?
I was bored.
I wanna show you something?
I can't believe I'm doing this.
 Can you start the tape?
Don't think this means I like you or anything.
And as soon as this is over I'm going back downstairs.
 That's Mrs. Holzclaw's car. She's your P.E. teacher, right? I hated her too.
And Bill McAllister... I went to school with his brother. They're both dicks.
 I planted an ounce of weed in his locker then sent an anonymous letter to Principal Lipsky.
I took care of her too.
Why did you do that?
I had to.
Why?
I did it for you.
I don't understand.
Please tell me.
I felt like if I didn't save you then no one else would.
 Please turn off the FUCKING CAMERA!
Jimmy! What the hell are you guys doing up there?
Hey, great party, huh? I'm making a tape for my parents. Want to say something to them?
Jimmy!
Hey Mom. Happy anniversary. You want to say anything to yourself?
That's enough.
 Get out! Now!
Jimmy, we discussed this. You can't tape our sessions. It's not allowed.
You know, you can't film someone who doesn't want their image and voice recorded. Technically, you're actually breaking the law.
Does your defiance make you feel more powerful?
Filming people makes you feel like you're in control of the situation doesn't it?
I can sit here as long as you can. You're not going to be able to force me to participate in your little game here.
Jimmy, this isn't something that friends do to each other is it?
Jimmy, put the camera away, please.
You're wasting your time and mine, Jimmy. We could be doing something productive.
That's enough.
Put it away.
Now Jimmy!
Come on Jimmy.
Gimme the Goddamn fucking camera!
No. No filming.     I'm leaving, I swear.
Okay, okay. Wait.
Say what you said to me before.
I don't know how I said it.
Paraphrase it then.
Do what?
Say it like you did before but it doesn't have to be exactly the same.
You mean paraphrase it.
That's what I said.
I didn't hear you.
Are you ready?
I'm waiting for you.
OK.
Tell me when.
Now.
You want me to paraphrase it?
 Yes!
I can't remember what I said.
Then just ad-lib.
Ad-lib?
Yes.
I don't know what that means.
 It means make it up.
 Do you want me to make something up or paraphrase what I did the first time?
Let's take a break.
I'm not good on camera.    It makes me nervous.
Forget about the camera.   Talk to me.
OK.
Tell me what you said earlier. About me about how you felt when you saw the video.
 It felt like someone had been reading my mind.
Go on.
It was like someone had jumped into my head and watched what was being projected.
And earlier, what you said about God.
 Tell me.
I said that it felt like God had sent someone to protect me, and to look out for me.
And I said that you are the only person in my life who has ever looked after me like that.
God, I hate it when you film me crying!
How do you like it, huh? How do you like having a camera shoved right up your ass?
Do you like it? Do you?
I don't like it or dislike.   I'm used to it.
Generally I'd place the camera further away from my nose, but if this is your preferred shooting style then I guess I'll have to adjust to it.
How's this work for you?
Give me a break.
OK.
So... why do you have to film everything?
I don't film everything.
Why do you like to film me crying?
I don't.
Then why do you?
Because it's rare that I get to find someone that lets their emotions go. When a person is crying, I mean truly crying, or truly laughing or smiling or frowning or gasping. For a few seconds or minutes I get a chance to see that person's soul. And really, now that you've forced me to think about it. I think it's a very rare and beautiful thing to be afforded that opportunity.
Anything else?
Why me?
Because.
Why do you think?
Why you and why me? Why are we together right now?
Go ahead say it. I want you to.     I know what you're going to say so just say it.
Stop.
 Tell me.
 Tell me!
 Because we're both fucking weird!
Because we're the two weirdest kids in the world. And God made us for each other and I fucking love you, and you did all this because you love me too, and fuck everyone and everything that doesn't get it!
That's right, right?
Where are you taking me?
To a beautiful place.
Where?
Chuck E. Cheese.
No seriously.
I can't tell you.    It'll ruin it.
Fine.
Jimmy, can I ask you something?
Anything.
Do you hate your parents?
Yes, but I understand them.
What's to understand?
Lots of things.
Like what?
I understand that my ascension into young adulthood triggered their descent into mid-life crisis. Generally when an only child leaves the nest, the parents begin reassessing their own lives. They see us as a younger, better version of themselves. 
They feel abandoned by our need for privacy and insecure because we no longer seek their approval. They used to take us to baseball games and cover our scrapes with bandages, but once we no longer need Mom to nurture our bruises or Dad to be our hero it puts their roles and subsequent sense of self worth into question.
How do you know all these things?
When you don't have any friends, don't play sports, don't go out, have no one talk to, nowhere to go, no one to listen to you, or no one to help you figure things out, you sort of have to figure things out by yourself. And without any of those things I have nothing but time to think about stuff.
You are SO smart.
You are so beautiful.
You think I'm pretty?
I think you're the most beautiful person I have ever met. The most beautiful person in the universe.
No one has ever told me that.
Get used to hearing it.
Do you think I'm smart?
Yes.
Do you think I'm fat?
Yes.
How could you say that? I only way a hundred and ten pounds.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said flat. As in flat chested.
I am not FLAT!
Prove it.
I don't have to prove it.   Here look.
I still can't tell.
I wear a full B cup.
Show me.    Take em out.
I am not going to take them out! You take yours out.
It's already out.
I can't believe you did that.
That's why I did it. Now come on. I showed you mine, let me see yours.
Wow.    Give me the camera.
No.
Please, pretty, pretty please with sugar on top.
Here, I'll pull over.
Let me see 'em.
That doesn't count. Come on, for real this time.
I'm embarrassed.
Don't be.    You can trust me.
You can. You can trust me with your life.
 Please.
Will you take off your bra?
 I just realized something.
What's the matter?
I just showed you my breasts and I saw your penis and we haven't even kissed.
You haven't even asked me to be your girlfriend and I did that. I'm a slut.  I don't want to be a slut.
Will you be my girlfriend?
Yes.
Can I kiss you?
 Yes. Will you turn off the camera?
I want this moment to be captured forever. I'd rather not kiss you at all than waste the opportunity to document the most beautiful moment of my life.
 I wanna see your smiley face again.
 Turn the camera off. Turn the camera off. Turn it off.
How do you feel?
Relaxed, happy, confident, studly, excited, relieved, delighted... I love you Judy.
You do?
Very much so. I always have.
Me too.
Do you want to pull over again?
Are you getting this?
Come on.   Are you getting this?
This is where you wanted to take me?
Yeah, what's the matter?
I wanna go home.
Don't fuck this up.    Please don't fuck this up.
Just try to be normal.  Just be normal! God damn it why do you have to fuck everything up?
Be normal.     Be normal.   Be normal!
 Hi.
So how do you feel now, right at this moment?
I don't know.  That was soooo good.
You were good. What got into you?
I don't know. I've just really been wanting you lately. Really bad.
Why's that?
I'm embarrassed.    I can't say.
Now you have to tell me.
It was after yesterday.
Yesterday?
Yeah, it was after I saw you shoot that gun.
You were crying. I wanted to kill myself after I did that. You were scared and you were shaking. It was the most awful thing I ever did. I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I was scared at first. Really scared. I didn't expect it to be so loud and you looked so mean. But then I got home and started thinking about it. About how your muscles looked and how dangerous it all seemed. It made me like... all excited, and like...
Horny?
Here.    Hold this.
Where you going?
One sec!
That is so hot!
My dad keeps it in his closet. Here.
It's heavy.
Now I see the appeal.     Give me the camera.
What do you think of this?
Do you like that?
Yes.
That is SO hot.
Fuck!   It's my parents!
Hi sweety.
Are you ready for me, you fucking slut?
Not quite.
I don't feel like waiting. Hurry up bitch. What do you have left to do?
I just need to put on my makeup.
Come on slut.
Hi mom.     Hi dad.   What are you guys up to?
What the fuck are you doing here?
 I told you he would find out you fucking freak! No wonder he's a fucking psycho. Look a his father.
Turn off the that fucking camera! Turn off that fucking camera right fucking now god damn it!
Gee dad, what do you say the two of us go out to the front yard and throw some ball together? We'll have a nice friendly game of catch.
You little mother fucker.     Turn off that fucking camera!
Stop it!     You're going to kill him.
Bitch!
Fuck you! You think you know me? You don't know me! You piece of shit!
 Mom!
You little beast! You want to film something? Film this!
Nancy, Nancy, Nancy, Nancy! Please someone call me Nancy. My name is Nancy.
 Nancy, Nancy, Nancy... Jimmy please call him "Nancy" for the love of God. Call your daddy Nancy. Call him Nancy...!
Take me out to the ball game, take me out to the crowd, buy me some peanuts and crackerjacks...
Give me that fucking tape!
I don't think so Nancy.   Nancy, Nancy, Nancy...
I'm so glad you're out. Next time your dad wants to take it in the ass, DON'T FILM HIM!
I know. Ironic that I was the one sent to the nut house.
I thought I was going to die without you. What if you and I could live here together? Forever.
Right here?
I'm serious. Maybe not here, but eventually we'll buy some land, and we can live together on it, and be naked whenever we want.
Excuse me.     What do you think?
I think you're drunk.
I think you're right mister.
I don't want this to ever end. I want to be here forever. I want to dance and be naked and be free, and I want us to ball our brains out everyday, and I want to feel the air on my body and I want to get drunk and not care about anything in the world. I just want us to be together in this moment.
I know a place like that.
You do?
Yep. We can go there one day if you want.
We can?    Where is it?
Erlanger.
 Erlanger!
Yeah Erlanger. Everybody was talking about it in the nut house. That's ALL anybody fucking talked about was this dude who lives up there named Uncle Rodney. He supposedly has a commune where we can do this kind of thing every day.
Uncle Rodney's commune?
That's funny.
 No, I'm serious.
Hey!
Okay, now it's your turn.
How does it feel to be a free man?
Come on, come on, come on...
I'm thinking.
Just let it go, be free.
 You're such a hippie all of sudden.
Come on.
No.
Okay, go.
Come on!
Okay, you really wanna hear something?
Yeah.
I want to go one day without masturbating. I want to liberate my penis. I want to clone you so we could have a three way and neither of us would be cheating. I want you to scrape my balls with a cheese grater...
That's gross!
And I love you. I love you so much it hurts.
It hurts?
Like God is stabbing me in heart with a thousand knives at the same time and you're the only one who can make the pain go away. Do you love me that much?
I love you so much, I'd rather die than be without you.
Here.
Make me a promise... the way a husband and wife make a promise... that we will be together always and forever.
You mean get married?
Something more powerful than marriage. It's a bond. It's our bond. It's transcendental.
What?
Transcendental.  Here.
It's transcendental because it transcends everything. Life, love, law, people, things... A bond so strong that our souls will become one and it can never end, even in death. If you swear on the bond, it means you'd rather die than break your promise.
That's so beautiful.
You're so beautiful.    I want to love you forever.
Swear on the bond. Swear we'll be together forever, that you'd rather die than be apart.
I swear on the bond.
And we'll never let anything come between us, not even death.
Not even death. I swear. Nothing will come between us, ever.
We'll be together forever.
 Together forever.
This is action ten news reporter Jimmy Van Muffmuncher reporting to you live from the parking lot of Dick's grocery store where we're going to witness the beautiful, the talented, the amazing Judy, commit her first crime.
Is there anything you would like to say to the public and your adoring fans before you go through with this?
Well Mr. Van Muffmuncher. I just want to say that I look forward to losing, my, um...
What did you call it before?
Your conformist crimeless virginity.
Yes, I am very much looking forward to losing my conformist crimeless virginity. I would also like to share with my fans these.
 Thank you and thank your tits for this rare, behind the scenes look at your first crime slash moment of truth.
Jimmy, turn it off.    We're gonna get busted.
No way, this is the best part.
Hey you two. Stop.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Turn that damn thing off. You can't be running around the store playing with a camera. It's against the store policy. Now get out of here.
What is the matter with you Jimmy? You almost got us caught. You're so worried about that camera. What is it? What is it!
Twenty years from now, when we're together watching these tapes you'll realize how special this moment is. I owe it to you. And I owe it to us to capture everything and anything we do together.
Well you freak me out sometimes. Why do you have to tape everything? It's like you have a problem or something.
You know, most of the reason kids think you're so weird is because of it. Why do you think everybody makes fun of you? And then I have to hear it and I have to deal with it.
So everybody makes fun of me, huh?
Yeah. Can't you give the thing a fucking rest?
And you don't want to deal with it? Well fuck them and fuck you too if you think that. I couldn't give a fuck what people say. This is my life and I want to document it. And right now me filming you happens to be the only reason I manage to get out of my fucking bed every morning! You can't take this away from me!
How does it feel Jimmy? How does it feel to have someone taping you while you're crying?
Tell me. Look at the camera and tell me how it feels!
You're not getting it. It doesn't matter how it feels right now. 
What matters is that you're seeing what's inside of me and your taping it. Can you understand that?
Can you?
I don't know.
Well can you at least try?
Yes.    I can most definitely try.
And you can never, ever, ever ask me to not film you or anything we do. That's the only thing I'll ever ask of you. Agreed?
Okay.   I'm sorry.
Will you swear to it?     On camera, will you swear to it?
Please raise your right hand.
Please repeat after me.    I Judy...
I Judy...
Do hereby solemnly swear...
Do hereby solemnly swear...
That I will never ask, request, or even insinuate to Jimmy to cease filming, no matter the situation.
That I will never ask, request, or even insinuate to Jimmy to cease filming, no matter the situation.
And furthermore, I do hereby solemnly swear to commit myself to giving Jimmy his daily blowjob and will continue to perform various sex acts with the skill and enthusiasm that he has become accustomed to.
Keep your right hand up.
I do hereby solemnly swear to g...
Mother fuckers.
Here, you're definitely going to want to tape this.
 Oh my God.
 Oh, God Jimmy...
 I love you Jimmy.
Jimmy stop, please stop. Jimmy... oh god, Jimmy stop. God damn it, fucking stop!
Oh, God Jimmy, oh God...
Jimmy...
 We're going to need an ambulance stat at the parking lot of the grocery store on Route 18...
Hi baby. I miss you.  Mwaa! I'll be waiting for you when you get out. Be good and don't wait too long. Look what I did for you!
I can't wait to use it on you!
Can I get a double cheese burger, no pickles, large fries and a coke?
That's what I fucking missed more than anything. Fast food.
And a number two.
What did you do in there all day?
Masturbated mostly.
 You cheated on me! I want to be the only person responsible for making you cum.
I hope you're willing to be on call twenty four hours a day.
Seriously, what did you do? What was a day in the life of Jimmy in the nut house?
Well, besides masturbating, I talked and talked and talked and fucking talked until they were satisfied. But basically I told them what they wanted to hear. I said shit like...
"Now that I'm finally able to talk about my problems, I now realize that my behavior was inappropriate and harmful to others."
Then I figured it out. I had to cry as much as possible. Whenever someone would cry they'd call it a "break through." So I'd be like.
You start out slow, then you build it up like this... "Now I know that using violence is not the answer."
Then you go like this: (snaps back into the impersonation) I was wrong, I know I was wrong and I'll never do it again. I don't want to hurt people or myself.
Boo hoo, waaaaaa, boo-hoo-hoo, waaaaaaa.  Then you always give them the obligatory hug at the end. After a couple of weeks, then they officially diagnose you with something, give you a prescription, then you're done.
God, you're a genius.
So what did they say you have?
ODD. Oppositional Defiance Disorder.
You're so lucky. I wish I was diagnosed with something. What does it mean?
ODD is a disorder characterized by an overwhelming pattern of negative, hostile, and defiant behavior which causes severe delusions where the patient can no longer distinguish fantasy from reality.
Wow.   I love that!
You see. They fucked up my order. I specifically asked for no pickles.
 Oh, no! How will ODD Boy handle this? Will his ODD brain be able to withstand a pickle screw up at the drive thru?
Ooow, jeez, they're hot! I burnt my nipples with the pickles.
I love the ghetto. I don't know what it is about it. I fucking love it. It's always the first place I go to when I get out.
I love it when you're out of the looney bin. Do you think you might be able to try to avoid the place for a while?
 If they don't send me to the bin, maybe they'll send me to jail.
I'm serious. You act like it's no big deal when you go away!
 All right.
No it's not all right! When you're in there I have to be out in the real world alone, by myself Jimmy. You go away and come back like it's no big deal. Well it is a big deal. I don't want to spend another day without you. Do you understand me? I'd rather die.
I'm not going back.
Judy.
I promise. I swear on my life and I swear on our bond, I'll never go back.
If you swear on our bond, then I believe you.
I love you so fucking much.
I love you too.
What's the matter?
I was thinking, the last time you got out we did it like five times, like as soon as we saw each other, we got naked and started doing it. And today, my parents weren't even home and I tried to do some stuff to you, but you were acting like you weren't interested.
I didn't mean to.
Was it because you jerked off so much while you were locked up?
No.
 Then why don't you want to have sex with me Jimmy? You don't think I'm pretty anymore?
No, no, no! That has nothing to do with it. After I saw my dad being rammed in the ass by my mother, I kind of blocked it out, but when I was in there they kept talking to me and talking to me about it. Now I can't stop it from coming into my head. Every time I get wood, the instant replay machine in my brain projects this image of my Mom pounding into my Dad.
God, that's awful.   I didn't know.
Yeah well, you know you didn't give too much of an effort to get in my pants anyhow. You just sort of made your sex face and grabbed my crotch.
How do you like this?
Now we're talking.
That is so hot.
Watch out!
I think you hit someone.
Stay here.
 Oh my God, what are you doing?
Oh fuck, oh fuck. Oh my god. Jimmy?
Don't put him in here!
We're taking him to the hospital.
No, we'll get busted.
What... what are you doing?
He's not breathing. He's not fucking breathing!
Is he dead?
 Pop the trunk for me.
No.
Judy.
What are we gonna do?
I don't know right now, but we're not driving around with a dead guy in our back seat.
I just want to go home. Jimmy, let's leave him. He's dead. We should just go.
Pop the fucking trunk already before someone sees us!
 I want to go home.
 Fuck!
Jimmy, I...
I'm driving.
Get in.
Are you gonna fucking get in!
We should just leave him here.
We can't leave him in the middle of the fucking ghetto. Get in before someone sees us!
I don't want him in my fucking car! I want him out!
Oh shit!
It's the fucking cops.
Just shut up.
It's the cops. It's the cops. It's the...
Shhhhhh!
You gotta play it cool, okay?
Stop fucking crying. Please, I'm begging you. Stop it.
Oh God. He's getting out of the car. We've got a dead homeless guy in our trunk and he's...
SSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Oh, my god Jimmy, he's walking towards us.
SSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Just be cool.
Good evening. License and registration please.
Certainly, sir.
Could you please step out of the vehicle?
Jimmy!
AAAAAHHHHHHH!
What happened?
Shut up!
What happened!
Just shut the fuck up! I don't fucking want to talk about it!
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT FUCKING HAPPENED! I WANNA KNOW. I WANNA KNOW. I JUST WANNA FUCKING...!
What are you doing?
 I'm filming.
It's dark.     You can't see anything.
It's on infra-red. Do you wanna see?
No, I don't wanna see.
He's beautiful. He really is. There's a certain serenity to death I appreciate.
He's dead. He's in my car, Jimmy, and he stinks. I wanna go home.
I don't think I can do this.
I'm not like you. I can't do this.  I wanna fucking go home.
Yeah, well you can't fucking go home. And you will do this. You did do this. You killed him. You didn't get in the car until the cops showed up. Now we don't have a choice. You want me to go to jail? You want that?
 No.
 What are we going to do?
We just need to make intelligent decisions. That's all. We'll find a way to take care of it. Then we'll go away. We'll fix it. It'll be okay. I promise.
You promise?
Yeah.   Come here.
It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna take care of everything. I promise.
 Oh, my god. The hair burning is making me nauseous.
Yeah, God damn. Burning bodies fucking stinks. That bum's body odor is being cooked right off him.
Jimmy!
What?    I'm not in the mood.
 Don't have to be in the mood. Doesn't matter. The camera's on, it's on.  You wanna know where we're gonna go?
Okay, where are we gonna go?
We're going to Lincoln to visit Dinko.
Who's Dinko, Jimmy?
He's cool. And he's got his own place, and he said I could stay there whenever ever I wanted. Plus he knows about you and he wants to meet you. And he doesn't like cops, so he's not gonna call 'em. Okay? Now gimme a smile.
No.
Gimme a smile, and I'll let you see my smiley face again.
I can't get sexy with that smell. I just can't.
Hey! The video-man. I remember that shit when we was in together. Said you video-ed everything.
Yep.
Hey man, it's cool if you guys stay here for a while, but I have a small business to run man. There's going to be some people knocking on the door and shit. I can't have you guys answering the door or the phone. That's the only rule. Other than that man, we're going to getting fucked up together all the time. I got a shit load of crank dude, that shit is off the fucking hook. Here, take a hit.
No thanks, I just want to film Judy dancing.
Right man. That's cool. Hey um... If I tell you to stop taping though, man, you gotta stop. I got some hard core junkies coming over here. Sometimes, if they see shit like that, they fucking flip. Crank junkies are a whole different kind of breed man. They're fucking hard core mother fuckers. You don't know what they're gonna fucking do. This one guy got paranoid about something. He used to climb on his roof to take a dump. That's the only place he would shit! How fucked up is that?
You're not even paying attention to me Jimmy.
Don't I look sexy?
Yeah, you look real sexy baby. Real nice.
Hey, I may have some work for you if you're cool with that.
What kind of work?
You know some hustling, some good money. I'll teach you how to mix the shit. Your girlfriend too if she wants.
 Yeah. That's what I've always wanted to do. Learn to make and sell crystal methamphetamine. You're a fucking genius Dinko.
 Yeah, man! Fuckin' high five.
 So is she, like, your girlfriend or are you guys just fucking?
She's my girlfriend, my best friend, and yes we fuck. And don't ever, ever fucking touch her. That's MY only rule Dinko.
Jimmy!
It's all good man. I ain't gonna touch your old lady. Shit man, she's so into you anyway.
So there's this dude. Fucker taught me everything I know about meth and shit. He'd fucking flip for your girl, man. You should go up and see him. He's in Erlanger.
Uncle Rodney?
Right, right! I forgot.     Yeah, Uncle Rodney!
You have an Uncle Rodney baby?
I want to meet your uncle.
He's not my uncle. He's not anybody's uncle. People just call him that. He's the one I told you about from the nut house.
I said one day I'd take you up to Erlanger one day, remember?
When was that?
When we were naked.
We're always naked, Jimmy.
 Fuck... Woah, that's cool.
That's some good shit, huh?
 Uh huh...
So you guys should like, totally go see him, man. I don't fuckin' go up there no more, 'cuz like, I got all the shit I need right here man, 'cuz my place is cool and all, but there's no fucking room here, ya know? So like you should go see him and shit.
You like this, Jimmy?
 Yo!  Customers call.
Yo, Jimmy.     Is your girl into chicks?
I don't know.  Are you into chicks?
Do you want me to be into chicks?
 Sure Dinko. Bring her in.
You know what, never mind Dink.    I don't think Judy's into chicks.
Yeah, I'm not into chicks.
Well Hazel here will do anything we want. Ain't that right Hazel?
You're into chicks aren't you Hazel?
Um, I really just want to get some stuff and get out of here.
Shut up you fat fucking junkie and take your clothes off or you ain't getting shit.
Come on!
I don't...
 Just do it, you fucking whore!
Jimmy.
Jimmy, stop him!
He's a big boy, he can do what he wants.
Ever made a porno?
Not with you.
Well all right! Keep filming mother fucker, I'm gonna fuck this junkie for you. You guys are free to join in whenever you like.
I swear to God Jimmy if you let him go through with this I'll never talk to you again!
You ready?     You filming?
I'm filming. Are you going to fuck her or are you just gonna talk about it?
 Jimmy!
 How's this? You getting good camera angles and shit?
Turn her ass towards the camera.
 Take off them panties bitch...   Oh yeah! Come on bitch. Move.
That's it.     Just like that.
We're going to be doing this shit all the time brother.
You think so?
Fuck yeah!
You don't have to hold a gun to her head man. There's plenty of other chicks we can do that to. If that's what you're into, then fuck it, I'll...
Take it!
Finish him off! He deserves a bullet right in the fucking face, doesn't he?
 Yeah. Yeah. He does.
Then do it.
Good bye Dinko, mother fucker. Thanks for letting us borrow your car, and for the cash.
And for the crank!
You feeling good baby?
I feel calm. I don't care about anything.
What are we going to do with the car Jimmy?
Ditch it.
The crank?
Snort it.     Give some of it away.
The cash.
Vacation baby. Anywhere we want to go.
You know the video's gonna cost you twenty extra, right?
Yeah.
Well alright then.    Let's get this sum bitch started!
Weeeeeelllll, you ain't nothing but a young bride... walking down the aisle.
Here she comes.
You ain't nothing but a young bride... walking down the aisle.
Well, if you don't marry Jimmy, then you ain't no friend of mine.
Do you...
 Judy. And here, we wrote our own vows.
Do you Judy promise to always swallow, to never cut your hair, or have another man's penis injected into any part of your body for as long as you both shall live?
I do.
Do you Jimmy promise to always fuck Judy with enthusiasm, to take a shower once a day, and promise not to inject your penis into any part of another person's body as long as you both shall live?
I do.
Can I get the rings?
With the power vested in me by the great state of Nevada... I do herby pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.
All right you two.     We got a schedule to keep.
Hurry up Jimmy, hurry, hurry, hurry, shit Jimmy. You're going to miss it.
...press conference in a few moments. The suspect's names are James Wright and Judy Elizabeth Oaks-Kellen...
No it's not! I'm Judy Wright now! (sing songy, like a little girl) I'm Judy Wright now!
Shhhh...     Shut up!
...from Burlington, Kentucky are wanted for questioning in the alleged murder of a Hamilton County Sheriff's Deputy that was killed two nights ago while on Patrol in the Over the Rhine section of Cincinnati. On a very serious note, the producers here at KPX-TV 4 would like to warn you that the images we are about to show are violent and graphic in nature and may not be suitable for young children. Once again, these are the images that were taken from a video camera that was mounted on board the patrol car. Viewer discretion is advised.
 Go ahead and open it.
 Put your hands on the vehicle.
 On the vehicle, now!
I didn't want us to be apart.
They know who we are now.  Actually, we're famous now.
That's the most romantic thing I've ever even heard of.
 ...have a few words and then we'll be taking questions.
Oh my God, that's my parents!   And your parents!
 We are very shocked about recent events. Our son has always been a dear sweet boy who is sometimes confused, but we want him to know that we love him very, very much and just want this whole thing to be over.
Bitch.
Shhhh...
Jimmy if you're out there, we know you're scared, but you're only making it worse. Please bring Judy back to us. We really miss her terribly.
Wait a second.
What?
I just want to look at myself one last time with hair.
OK, that's enough.
Stop.
What's the matter?
I'm not sure about this.
Come on.     I changed mine.
Yeah, but you look fucking great.
This was your idea Jimmy.
Fuck it.     Let's do this thing.
This is the look.
 Let's just leave it like this.
Don't be stupid.
I am one ugly mother fucker.
It feels funny.
I look like Dr. Evil.
Come on. Let's go across the street and get a shit burger.
You're such a fucking pig when you eat.
Aaaaaaaaaahhh!
Gross. That's it. I'm not taking you to the country club, ever!
 Awww... I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings?
I'll take you to the country club. I promise.
When?
I don't know.
Thanks for marrying me. You're my prince charming that came and swooped me off me feet.
And one day, we're gonna have a house and a white picket fence and a baby. Tell me what you think we should name the baby.
What's wrong?
What?
Shhhh. Shut up.  Give it to me.
What are they doing?
Shhh.
Shit.
What?
They're outside our room.
Oh God, Jimmy! They know where we are. We're going to get caught!
Jimmy!
 Let's go.
Get in.
They don't see us.
I know.    Just shut up!   Let me think.
Are they coming?
I don't know. I don't think so.
No.   I don't think they're coming.
 Oh, fuck.  That was close.
Hey baby, wake up baby. Time to get up little fuck nugget.
Good morning Mrs. Wright. And how are we feeling this afternoon?
Where are we?
It's a surprise. Come on. I want you to drive us in. I want to film you when we get there.
 Okay.
What am I gonna see?
I hate it when you do that.    Tell me!
Nope.    Keep looking.
How much further!    Aaa!
Shhh.    Just drive.
Oh my God.     Is that it?
Is this where your friend lives?
This is where we live.
We do?
Maybe. If you want to.       For a little while.
This is sooo amazing.       It's like a dream.
Go over here.
Stop here.
Take it.
Is that Uncle Rodney?
No, that's Buddy. He said Rodney's been expecting us. We're, like, celebrities or something Judy.
Really?
Yeah!   He wants to meet you.
Wow.
We got like thirty five trailers here. Long as we've got some that's empty you can stay in one. Sometimes people come in and we got get you a tent or-- fuck, everybody's friendly--- you can always find a bed to crash in.
It don't look like much but we do some pretty good partying around here. Ya'll are welcome to stay as long as ya like. Fuck it, you can stay forever. There's only two rules. Don't mess around with the labs which are down back there...
Woah... No filming that shit. Seriously. That's part of rule number one. 
Don't even go near there with the camera, and two is no cops, but fuck, seeing what kinda shit you guys got into, I don't think we gotta worry about you calling 'em up for a visit.
Other than that, ya'll can do whatever the hell you want, whenever the hell you want. You wanna do some of the stash at the parties, that's cool too. We'd like it if you do it, normally we'd say you gotta sell some too, but Rodney says y'all's is a special case 'cuz you ain't leaving 'til the heat's off for sure, that could be months or... shit, years for you guys. But no one up here's in a fucking hurry.
Look at you. Little bitch from the nut house, and you got yourself one sweet looking bride! I still can't get over the tits on this girl.  Come here sweetheart.
We're gonna have a party for y'all tonight. You know that? We have parties damn near every night, but this one's gonna be special just for you guys.  You like that sweety?
Sure Buddy.
 Nice piece of ass you got here. Best you keep an eye on it so it don't wander off on ya.
We're here!
Shit! Y'all's on your honeymoon. Ain't gonna film it yourselves.
That's nice.
Let's go inside.
 Hold on! Hold on!
And, three, two, one... Now!
All right! Look at the happy couple coming into their new home.  Da, da, da, dum...
How do you turn this thing off?
Just give your love to Uncle Rodney and you'll get it back ten times. Don't be afraid to love him and you'll learn to love yourself in return. He'll teach you the cycle, how we're all connected. If you give yourself freely and completely to him, you'll have nothing to worry about. That's what I did.
Ya'll are going to love it here man. See this?
This shit goes on every day. I been here for six months man and I love it. Thank God my parents kicked me out... All you got do is listen to Uncle Rodney and you'll have the best fucking time of your life. Oh, yeah.  And don't fuck with him, 'cuz he'll kick your ass!
Jimmy, come swimming.      The water's warm.
Is it?
Come on.
Later.    I just want to look at you now.
Why?
Because you look happy, happier than you've looked in a long time.
Hey!
Hey again.
So you like it here?
How long will they let us stay?
It's up to Uncle Rodney.
What's he like?
I never met him. He's supposed to be cool, though... and weird. Weird as hell.
Well if he's weird, he's great weird, whatever he is. 
If we could stay here forever, like Buddy said, I wouldn't need anything else.
The cops won't come will they?
Buddy said Rodney's cousin's the Sheriff or something. Do you want to meet him?
 The Sheriff?
No!   Rodney.
 Can I?
I'm gonna see him tomorrow. Buddy says he wants to talk to me. Maybe he wants to talk to you too.
He does?
I don't know. Buddy said he thought you were pretty.
Oh my God!
I told you you were. You're the prettiest girl in the world.
 I love you Jimmy.
Me too.
You nervous?
 No.
I would be.
He's suppose to be cool.
He's more than cool man. God, you really don't have a clue do you?
Um... Judy wants to meet him.   I don't know if I can ask.
Shit man. Don't have to. She's one of his girls, man. She'll meet him.
What the fuck does that mean?
Relax dude... Just like you're one of his boys. Shit man, I'll give you two weeks and you'll WANT her to experience him. You may even want to, too.
Just go see him. Here, take your camera.
He wants you to film him, man. With the camera. He'll tell you when to turn it on, then you video.
Just one second.
Take your time man. I want you to feel comfortable. More importantly, I want you to get this right.
I'm ready whenever you are.
Just a second. I have to take care of my baby.
She's beautiful isn't she?
 Please...
Some people come here too far gone. Like Hazel here. The only thing I can do for her is ease her pain.
Please...
 Shhhhh... How about a baby one?
Yes.
 There you go...
There's something about addiction that brings out something beautiful in a person. Addiction is pure. Addiction reduces a person to an infant. And there's nothing more pure and beautiful in the world than an infant.
Hazel is no longer an adult. She's an infant and I'm the surrogate mother who provides her with much needed breast milk. It's a role that both of us have accepted and embrace.
 That's my girl!
She's a little jumpy.
Let's begin shall we? And please... I'm going to use this tape for my fans, so let's try to get this right.
OK.
I apologize if any of this frightens you or makes you uncomfortable.
I'll be fine.
No. You won't be fine. What I'm going to teach you will be frightening. The truth is an acquired taste but once you get to it, it's all you'll ever want.
Those kids out there... we, the so called "undesirables" - you and me, we know the truth. You know that society doesn't want you, your parents don't want you, corporate America sure as fuck doesn't want you... You wouldn't be here otherwise. 
If this government had a choice, they'd gas us all in a heartbeat, exterminate us like the Jews, enslave us like niggers, cuz don't kid yourself, WE ARE the new niggers in this country. No one respects us... No one sees what we have to offer... No one has compassion for us.... They don't care, or they're too naive to see that we're a by-product of a wasteful society that has failed to educate, embrace, influence, or inspire any of us. We're societal garbage. The counter culture no longer exists. It's dead... It's been replaced by us--
The garbage culture... thrown aside, imprisoned, institutionalized, systematically abused, executed, and enlisted into wars started by government ass- fuckers just to kill us off. JUST TO KILL US OFF. And every week one of you shows up here, disillusioned, addicted, angry, pissed 'cuz they tossed you aside... into the garbage. Every time someone like you shows up here the garbage culture gets a little bit stronger and they get a little bit weaker. Until the "them" and the "they" of this country run out of places to put us, to put its garbage, and the garbage OVER-FLOWS into their cities from out of the confines of the spaces that they have set aside for us.
 And we will SET FIRE to their world! And we will burn it, until a living HELL REIGNS over what was their former world, and we will fornicate in their ashes!
That's what's here for you.   That's what's here...
Where's Judy?
I'm so glad you guys came down here. We never would have guessed you'd come and see us.
You've been awesome.   Judy loves it here.
I knew she would. By the way.
I know what you did to Dinko.
 What the fuck are you doing?! Jimmy, Jimmy!
Jimmy!   Jimmy!
 Shut it, bitch!
Here, here, here. Right here.
Jimmy!
Judy?
 Please somebody help us!
Judy!
 Fuck you!
Jimmy!   Jimmy say something!
 Jimmy. Jimmy say something.
 Noooooo! Noooooo!
 Jimmy!
Who the fuck...!
Hey!
Judy, Judy, wake up. Fucking wake up!
Judy?   Judy?
Judy wake up.
Are you all right baby?   Please wake up Judy. Judy?
Judy, sweetie. Come on honey.      I saw you waking up.
There ya go.
Hi, baby.
You okay?
Am I with you?
You're with me.
Then I'm okay.
Mexicooooooh....
Hey baby.
Baby?
Come on.     Not the camera.
Nooooo. It reminds me of when we first met. Just you, me, and the camera. God, do you remember how you used to freak me out?
Yeah, those were the good old days. How much money do we have?
I don't know, why?
How do you feel about Canada?   It's closer.
Are we going together?
I think I should take you home.
I could write you a letter. Or I could make a video saying I made you do everything. They'd believe you. You could tell them it was all my fault. You could tell them I was going to Mexico and I'd really go to Canada.
We swore on the bond we'd never be apart... but... 
I'll let you out of it... If you want to be out of it, I'll let you out.
You're never leaving me, and I'm never leaving you. That's all there is to it.
Okay.
Owww.
You're so handsome, you know that?
Jimmy?
Jimmy!
 What?
Jimmy, stop the car. You're too fucked up to drive.
 Huh? Oh... okay.
You wanted to ask me something?
Do you love me?
You know I do.
I do.
You know I love you, right?
Yup.
Judy?
Yes?
We're fucked.
What do you mean?
Look in the rearview mirror.
That's it baby. We're done.
Just pull over. It's not worth it.
Judy, what are you doing?      You know this is...
Don't do this.
Judy?
 Shut up!
I love you.
I love you too.
It's over.
 No.
It is.
No.
It's a dead end.
Do you hear that?
 No.
Come on, it's over. I'll do what I said before. I'll tell them I made you do it. It'll be okay.
No.   I want us to be together.
 Well we fucking can't, so pull the fuck over!
Yes we can. I won't give you up. I won't let you go. No way.
Come on.
Judy?
Judy!     Stop it.
Judy, what are you doing?
Judy!
Judy!     Stop!
Judy!
 We'll be together. We'll be together. We'll be together. We'll be together...
