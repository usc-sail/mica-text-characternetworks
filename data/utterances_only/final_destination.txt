Alex...
Tod and George's dad just called, he's picking you up at 10 in the morning. Bus leaves the high school for JFK at noon.
My suitcase workin' out for ya?
Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave that on. It's like... the tag made the last flight without crashin' or anything, right? So, it should stay on, or with, the bag for good luck.
Where would you get a nutball idea like that?
I'm still here.
Seventeen and on the loose. Ten days in Paris. In the springtime! Live it up, Alex...
Got your whole life ahead of you.
 Attention airline travelers...
This airport does not support solicitors...
You are not required to give money to solicitors.
Alright, you guys got everything?
Yeah, we're all set Dad.
Les estudients, allons en France!
Does that mean "go?"
I'll miss you guys.
Take care of those two, Alex.
I will. Don't worry.
I didn't think anything could worse than my yearbook picture.
Now you know how I feel havin' to look at you all the time.
Avis aux passagers...
Entendez classe, qu'est ce que c'est l'announce?
Vous n'etes pas dans l'obligation de contribuer aux demandes des quemandeurs.
 What the fuck's he want?
cher aeroport n'est responsable pour leurs activities.
The airport doesn't endorse solicitors.
Tres bien, Clear! Tout droit!
Fuh-ck, do we have to put up with that shit the whole time?
Death is not the end.
It will be for you if you harass my students.
 Hare Rama.
 Fuck off.
I have a few questions to ask you this afternoon.
Did you pack these bags yourself?
Have your belongings remained in your possession the entire time?
Have you recieved any packages from persons unknown to you?
Same as your birthday.
April 25th. Four-twenty-five... your birthday is the same as your departure time.
I can't believe they let that dickhead on this trip.
His parents bought a ton of those trip certificates we had to sell, just to get him out of their hair for ten days.
Dude, I so worked the ticket clerk so you're sittin' next to Christa and I'm next to Blake.
That's seven hours and most of it is in the dark.
Dude, if we don't get someone going on this flight, we should just call Dr. Kervorkian and put ourselves out of our fuckn' misery.
Thanks.
Dude, let's take a dump.
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torgue a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake? You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
John Denver...
He was born in the summer of his twenty-seventh year...
He died in a plane crash.
Ladies and Gentlemen, thank-you for your patience, at this time we would like to begin pre-boarding of Euro-Air Flight 180 to Paris through gate 39.
It's the Colorado Rocky Mountian High/ I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky...
Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock? How'd we lose him?
Vingt huit, vingt neuf...
Good sign. Younger the better. It would be a fucked-up God to take down this plane.
A REALLY fucked-up God.
Alex?
Could you trade seats with Blake so she and I can sit together? I asked Tod, but he says he's got some medical thing?
 Fag.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
Flight Attendants prepare for departure.
Fasten seat belts...put on oxygen masks...
Alex?
Could you trade seats with Blake so she and I can sit together? I asked Tod, but he's got some medical thing.
Dude, what up?
Is there a a problem, sir?
What's your fuckin' problem?
Alex? Qu'est-ce se?
Qu'est-ce se?! THE PLANE'S GONNA EXPLODE!
Shut up, Browning!       You're not funny.
We have to get out!
We have to get off this plane!
Now! NOW!!
Sit! DOWN! Browning!
I'm not joking! I'm not joking!
Listen to me! This plane will explode on take-off!
Sir, we will remove you from the aircraft if this continues.
I'll remove him.
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
He didn't do nothin'!
 Anybody in the aisle is off the plane!
No, wait, I was late... that's my seat right there!
I didn't do anything! I have my ticket right here!
You got this?
No one gets back on board. That's my call.
PLEASE... I've got forty students going to Paris...
It's alright. It's alright. You're off the plane. You're off the plane...
Airline's not taking this very well. They'll let one of us back on and the rest can grab a six-ten flight. Gets in two hours later at DeGaulle. It's alright. It's not that big of a deal.
I'll stay.
No, you know the whole French thing. Get on the plane.
I was in the bathroom. The lock was stuck. I didn't fight with anyone!
I called your mom and dad and they're on their way.
Alex, talk to me. What happened?
I... I saw it... like, I don't know... the plane took off. I saw it leave the runway... I looked down and saw the ground...
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
You must have fallen asleep.
We get thrown off the plane and blow a half day in Paris because Browning has a bad dream?  It's going to explode! It's going to explode!
Fuck off, Horton.
Tod...
Only trip you're gonna take is to the fuckin' hospital.
There they go and here we stay.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
I wish you were on the plane!
You're lookin' at me as if I caused it. I did not cause this.
Is everyone dead? Are there any survivors?
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
He's not a witch.
Hello. I'm Howard Seigel, National Transportation Safety Board vice chairmen. We've notified your families and they are on their way. Does anyone feel they need medical attention or spiritual counseling at this time?
Have they found any survivors? What's going on?
The cause of the explosion is undetermined. Nassau county authorities are on the scene. Naval search and rescue are en route.
We understand how you must be feeling at this hour... and although we know it may be difficult, we must ask you some questions... regarding today's events, while it's still fresh in your minds.
It may be valuable to our rescue attempts, or any potential... criminal investigation.
You said...  "Listen to me! This plane will explode on take-off."  How did you know that?
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
Did you take any seditives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
No. I saw it. I saw it!
Not like a dream... more than that. I experienced the plane exploding... it was so horrible... I know what they all went through tonight...
I'm not a pyschic... I've never had this happen before...
Did this "weird feeling" have anything to do with you saying you wished Carter Horton was on the plane... just before it exploded?
No!
Why'd you say it?
Because... I... never thought it would really happen.
If that's the case, Alex... why did you really get off the plane?
My brother... told me to keep an eye on Alex. He stayed... and I went to make sure Alex was okay.  He told me to get off the plane.
Larry Murnau told me to get back on... but I told him to go.  I sent him back on the plane.
No one forced you to get off the plane. You told us you aren't friends with any that did... so, why did you leave the airplane?
Because I saw and I heard Alex. And... I believed him.
Here's good.
Thank you for the ride.
Thirty-nine days have passed since we've lost our thirty-nine loved ones, friends, and teachers.
As each day passes without a determining cause for the accident, we ask ourselves, "Why?"
Ecclesiastes tell us, "Man no more knows his time than fish taken in the fatal net...
...or birds trapped in the snare...
...like these the children of men...
...caught when the Time falls suddenly upon them."
And so before we can heal, before we can escape the presence of Death Time, we must mourn and celebrate theirs with this memorial.
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
I don't.
 All I owe is these people.  To live my life to the fullest.
Then maybe you should lay off the J.D.
Don't ever fucking again tell me what to do. I control me. Not you.
I'm never gonna die.
I took my driver's test this week at the DMV...
Got a 70. Lowest score, but I passed. When I was done with the test, the guy who drives with you during the test, he goes, "Young man, you're going to die at a very young age."  That true?
Not here, not now.  Not EVER!
If I ask out Cynthia Paster, will she say "no?"
Ms. Lewton...
Don't talk to me. You scare the hell out of me.
 Hey.
I don't want to sound gay, or nothin, but... I miss you.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
That's a plan.
I gotta go. This thing Ms. Lewton showed me in her class, they're gonna let me read it. It says what I'm feeling.
Because of you... I'm still alive. Thank you.
We say that the hour of death cannot be forecast...
But when we say this, we imagine that the hour is placed in an obscure and distant future.
It never occurs to us that it has any connection with the day already begun or that death could arrive this same afternoon.
This afternoon... which is so certain... and which has every hour filled in advance.
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun.
What happened? Is Tod alright?
Alex!
 Get outta here!
What... what happened?
Didn't you... "see" it?
Couldn't you "predict" it? Couldn't you read his mind?
Mr. Waggner...
You caused Tod so much guilt over George staying on the plane that...  He took his own life.
He wouldn't do it!
He... he told me we would be friends again after you got better. After you got over George. Why would he make plans for the future if he were planning on killing himself?
All my wife and I will ever know is we wouldn't have lost our youngest son... if you'd told our oldest to get off the plane.
Almost Autumn.
It's only the end of June.
 Yeah, but everthing's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
Know what this is?
Like, um... you're mad about something?
A piece of debris... from the plane. I went to the shore off the crash site and it washed up on the beach.
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
Why were you there last night?
Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen suicides. But they were there last night, that means: one, they still don't have a clue what caused the crash. Two, they haven't ruled out anything. And the fact that seven people got off the plane is probably weird enough, not to mention, that one of those people had a vision, or whatever, of it exploding minutes before it did explode, is highly suspicious. And it doesn't help that the visionaries' friend just committed suicide.
Why were you there last night?
Know what this is?
It's you.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
I'm... really sorry.
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehansible attraction.
Before that day, you were just another suburban nothing that would never have anything to do with my life. And I'm sure you thought I was some Marilyn Manson body-pierced freak, or whatever.  But at that moment... on the plane... I felt what you felt. I didn't know where all those emotions were coming from until you started freaking out.
I didn't see what you saw, but I felt it. Okay, I'm not into all that X-Files bullshit... but it was a psychic connection. Why to me? Why to you?
And you can still feel it, can't you? Something from that day is still with you. I know, because I can still feel you.
That's why I was there last night.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
"It?"
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
Is that something you're "feeling?"
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe... I would know.
Then, let's go see him!
 Gives me a rush...
This place?!
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Good call. Very "Quincy."
That... him?
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
That's him, but... he's not here. That... whatever... that whatever made him Tod is gone.
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking         Ohmygod! OHMYGOD! OHMYGOD! asshole. You think this        He's not dead? is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Please don't yell...
You'll wake the dead.
Why..?
Chemicals in the vascular flush create cadaveric spasm.
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
 I know who you are. The mortician eyes Alex, understanding. Alex senses this and eases. Clear moves toward Tod's body, examining the neck area.
They said he hung himself, but there's no marks.
I crafted a reconstruction of the Laryngeal prominence region with Velvetone Surgical Wax and Permaseal.
What are all those tiny marks?
Cuticle lacerations.
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
Why would they say it was a suicide... if it weren't?
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
In Death...
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
You saying Tod did kill himself?
Suicide. Murder. Plane crash. What does it matter? He was going to end someday. From the minute you're cut loose from the womb... it's a one way ticket on a trip to the tomb.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
Design?
If Life is like a box of chocolates... Death... Death is like a big Milton Bradley game of "Mouse Trap." The day you're born is just the boot, hanging from the streetlamp, kicking the marble to get things rolling. Growing up is only the marble rolling down the curving chute. You feel immortal having survived school, sex, drugs 'n' rock 'n' roll, but you've really only upset the big hand holding the steel ball that falls into the bathtub. Marriage and kids and career seem to make it all worthwhile until the ball hits the see-saw and flips the diving man into the big barrel. In the old folks home or the hospital you just see the big cage rattling down until it captures... the mouse.  Game over.
Maybe there's no way to win... but... if you figured out the game... you knew where the "steel ball was rolling" couldn't you avoid the trap and extend the playing time? Couldn't you... cheat Death at Its own game?
You already did that by walking off the plane. Now you gotta out when and how it'll come back at you.  Play your hunch, Alex. If you think you can get away from it.  But beware the risk of cheating the plan, disrespecting the design... could iniciate a horrifying fury that would terrorize even the Grim Reaper.  And you don't even want to fuck with that Mack Daddie.
I'm sorry we broke in.
No harm. No foul.
We didn't find what we were looking for.
Yeah, we did.
I'll see you soon.
The mortician was whacked.
He was trippin' on formaldehyde.
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
 As in flannels and plaids?
How many died on Flight 180? From our group?
Thirty-nine.
Remember the gate number?
No.
Thirty-nine.
Remember the departure time?
Like... 4:25.
Do you know when I was born?
4:25.
Right. April 25th.
Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
My birthday is the same as of the time I was meant to die! That's a reach!?
You're sounding like those people who, you know... "Oswald shot Kennedy from a warehouse and hid in a theatre and Booth shot Lincoln in a theatre and hid in a warehouse."
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
Hey, look! "Coffee" starts with a "C" and ends with an "E." So does the word "choke!" We're going to choke to death! Oh no! Starbuck was a whaler. We're going to be harpooned!
You'll go nuts if you start with that shit.
She's leaving the school. Moving away.
Clear, how do we know that by just sitting here, breathing this air or sipping the coffee, having crossed the street... we haven't started in motion the events that will lead to our death? Fifty years from now. Ten years. Tomorrow.  You don't unless... you're able to open yourself to the signs I'm willing to show you.
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like         on the plane?
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence.
The mortician said Death has a design. Now... if you, me, Tod, Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms. Lewton messed up that design, because, for whatever reason, I was able to see Death's plan... then we cheated it.  But what if it was our time, what if we were not meant to get off that plane? What if it is still is our time? If... It... is still not finished with us? We will all still die; now, not later.
Unless... we find the pattern. And cheat it again.
After hearing you, just now... I do believe...
...that Tod killed himself.
Then there's no one left who can help me.
Baby, come on... not now.
Carter...
Kind of have a reunion, here.
Let it go!
When are you moving?
A couple of weeks.
We're losing our favorite teacher.
Look, there's something you should all know.
Alex...
Lived here her whole life.        This'll be hard to believe.
And now she has to move.          Listen to me, we may all All because of Browning.          be in danger...
Shut up! The both of you!
They died! We lived!  Get over it! I won't let that plane crash be the most important thing in my life. I'm moving on, Carter, and if you're gonna waste your life beating the shit out of Alex everytime you see him, then you can just drop fucking dead!
It's that girl... Clear.
He's in the shower, Clear. Can I have him get back at ya? Sure... bye.
She's concerned about you.  I'm concerned about you.
Why don't you want to talk to her... or me?
Dad... you and mom have helped me out, so much. But there's... some things I need to understand before I can talk... to anyone about it.
The National Transportation Safety Board has a new theory tonight on the possible cause of Euro-Air Flight 180...
Deterioration of silicon insulation on an electrical connector to the scavenger pump may have leaked combustible fluids.
A spark in the fuel switch...
That's Tod's seat...
... may have ignited the fuel line. And proceeded to the fuel pump.
The path of the explosion...  That's Death's design.
Some nights I'm woken up by the sound of my own voice, you know, inside my head, goin', "No, you know the whole French thing. Get on the plane."
Everything here reminds me... of sending Mr. Murnau back on the plane... Right, I'm hoping a change will help... I lived here my whole life and wherever I looked were great memories, you know... but now all I can see is Mr. Murnau... those kids. Just looking out my own front yard... makes me feel mothing but fear.
 Laura, I gotta call you back.
This is Valerie Lewton. I need Agent Schreck...
What are you doing?
Checking the air in her tires to make sure they're safe.
Get in the car.
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
"Next?"
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
 Oh, you've noticed it, too?
Oh... mom's favorite.
He was born in the summer of his twenty-seventh year...
Where'd you get this "pattern" from? You have another "vision?" Maybe saw it in some T.V. static?
I didn't ask for what happened to me on the plane. You can make fun of me. You can think I'm a nut. I'm used to it. I saved six lives but the entire school acts like I'm a freak. Fine.
I'm not suffering from Post Traumatic Stress. I haven't developed a narcissistic deity complex. I'm not going Dahmer.  This just is. There's a pattern in place for you. And you. There's a design for everyone.
 And I'm not sure yet how... but I intend to break this one.
He left yesterday behind him/ You might say he's born again...
Alex, you got our attention, at first, because you were under suspicion in the plane explosion.
I know you didn't blow up that plane.
I don't believe you have magical powers. No one has any... control over life and death... unless... that person is taking lives and causing death.
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
Alright, go on. Get outta here.
Kid gives me the creeps.
We got nothing to hold him.
I don't mean that...  There's a couple of times, there... I almost believed him.
Sometimes, you give me the creeps.
When he first came to the mountains, his life was far away...
You gotta stop this! Stop this! It's just a stupid mug.  You're outta here. Pretty soon... you'll be gone.
It's the Colorado Rocky Mountain High...
I've seen it rainin' fire from the sky...
Rocky Mountain High/ Colorad-oh.
Ms. Lewton!
They say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun...
Ms. Lewton!
Hey, Alex...
I don't know where he is. He's not talking to me.
Why?
Because I didn't believe him.
If he should contact you, it would be in the best interest of your own safety to contact us.
What are you doing?
Terry's name should be on this wall.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
Are you?
They'll follow my car.  That's why you're taking me.
Why would I want to see him?
Because he knows which one of us is next.
Um... okay... drive the speed limit, right?
And don't pass on the right.
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision! You're the next one...
 Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
He could be anywhere from here to a mile down the shore. You guys drive down there, start this way and we'll meet around the middle. It'll take half the time.
Are they up there?
Somehow... is 180 still in flight? Somewhere... are they still safe?
When I was a kid, like, six or seven... I used to worry so much about my parents dying. Like lying awake at night... just worrying. I loved them so much. I didn't want them to get hurt. And what would happen to me? What would life be like?  Every night... it seemed.
Most kids do, I guess.
Most kids never have it happen.
When I was ten... my dad went into a 7-11 for cigerettes. I guess he heard somebody say "Don't turn around." So on reflex, or thinkin' a friend was jokin'... he did. And the guy blew his head off.
And, let me tell ya, I had every reason to worry before... because life became shit. I don't blame her, I guess, but my mom couldn't deal with it at all. She married this asshole, who my mom with my real dad would cross the street to avoid this guy. He really didn't want a kid. And so my mom didn't either anymore, I guess.  If that was the design for my father... and my family... then fuck Death, FUCK IT!
And so, anyway... I've thought of that "somewhere," Alex. It exists, that place.
Where my dad is still safe. Where he had a full pack of cigerettes and kept driving. A place where me and my dad and my mom... are still together....and have no idea about this second life, here.  A place where our friends are still in the sky... where everyone gets a second chance.
But that place might only exist in my heart. And maybe, now... yours. I haven't experienced too many second chances in my life. I haven't seen any. But because of all of this, I believe... because of you... I will get a second chance. Because of me, you will. With you in my life... that place, right now existing in our hearts, will spring out... and become a real part of this life.
And that is the only way we can beat Death... by making something special out of Life.
This won't be safe.
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
 Nothing is... anymore.
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
Why do you think I was hiding?
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Your shoe prints were in the blood. Your fingerprints on the knives...
I already told you...
 I'm not talkin' about if you did it. Or if you knew she was dead...  Did you know she was going to be next... before she was?
 Yeah.  When she died... at that moment, I could tell she saw something... horrible.
Out of us... who's next to see it?
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
Shoulda felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
 Whatta you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
You have a responsibility to tell me.
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
Aww, fuck... really?
Then why bother? What's the fuckin' point? Terry and me will be back together on the other side, so why wait any longer?
Knock it off!
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Not with us in the fuckin' car!
Stop it!                Hey, c'mon, man...
What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
No!                           Knock it off!
And I fuckin' HATED FRENCH CLASS!
Carter, stop it, you          Get control of yourself! fuckin' maniac!!
That's what I'm doin'!
I know what you're doing! It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
Watch it! Watch it!
Stop the car!              Let us out!
I am... so close to puking, you don't wanna know.
We're afraid, too, Carter, but we're not going to quit. Maybe you are. You act like you're not, but you are!
So, stop what you're doing and STOP THIS CAR! Right fucking now!
Move it!
Billy, get out!
Can't you open the door?!      Easy, Billy, just open it.
Carter, get out!
Don't do it! Don't do it!      It's coming! It's coming!
It ain't my time.
Get out! Get out of the car!        Get out! Get out of the Get out of the fuckin' car!         car!
I can't get out!
Man, he really is next.
Scared now?
It broke!
No one's that strong.
 Bullshit. He saved your life...again!
THAT'S RIGHT! HE'S RIGHT! YOU ARE NEXT! I'M GETTING THE FUCK AWAY FROM YOU!
SHUT UP, BILLY!
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
I DON'T NEED IT EVER! GET AWAY FROM HIM! HE'S NEXT!
FUCK YOU, BILLY! I'M NOT DEAD!
YOU WILL BE! YOU'RE DEAD! YOU'RE DEAD!
AND YOU AIN'T TAKIN' ME WITH YOU!
Jesus fucking Christ!
 You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
You're the fuckin' devil.
 But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
Police are coming.
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
My intervention in the death of 180 surviviors will cheat the design.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
You're losin' it. The police will be here. We have to go to the cabin. You can hide there. Get your head together.
After Billy... it's me. And then you.
 Hey, I won't let it happen, okay.
Then, get out of here.
 Rusted. Tetanus. Nice touch.  I overlooked it. You tried to capitalize. But I caught you, you fuck. I can beat you. Not forever, but I got this cabin rigged to beat you NOW!
She was up there a minute ago...
I'm not turning him in. There's another life that needs him now.
I go with you.
You can't.
Don't hurt him.
Tell us where he is. Wait at home, and I promise... we'll bring him back safe, in protective custody.
I... never moved. Christa asked me to move, but I didn't change seats. I would've moved up... next to Tod... How could I not remember... that... I never moved. Clear's seat was in front of mine...
She's next.
There!
Run!
 Lost him.
From the direction... there's only one place he can heading...
Don't move!
You're grounded in the car. Don't touch anything. DON'T MOVE.
Alex, get away from there!
Any part of that line touches you, you're dead.
NO!
Get back! You'll both die!
You know what to do.
No! No! Don't!
When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
You know what to do. I'll always be with you.
NO!
Is he alive?
A little more. Little more!
He's here. A beautiful boy.
I felt him! When the baby was born... I felt Alex pass through me... like the night he died...
13th of May... 4:25 p.m.
Exactly a year... to the minute.
We beat it, Alex.
Alex was right.
It did skip us.
I believe... that's what Alex believed. But how do we know... this wasn't the design all along?
