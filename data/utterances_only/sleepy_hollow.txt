4/10/95
Where are you?!
Here!  Over here!
I need your help with this.
Constable Crane?  Ichabod Crane... is that you?
Yes, it is me.  But, not only me...  I found someone here...
Someone quite dead.
Burn it.
Yes, sir.
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
He drowned.  Anyone could see.
There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
I could determine if he were dead before he went into the Hudson.
Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
Yes, must we?
There is nothing heretical about science, sir.  The Chinese have written on it for hundreds of years... procedural study used to solve seemingly unsolvable crimes.
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
And, with disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
Very few, if any.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
 Um, sir... might I suggest...
 There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
Chosen me?
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Not for lack of trying.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
 I shall, gladly.
Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.
Oh, and, Constable...  Do make certain that you meet with success.  Otherwise... perhaps you should not come back at all.
Such a day for such a sad farewell. But, this is goodbye, my sweet.
This is such a silly game.
Be a sport and stop complaining.
Play along.  You must.
There, I have someone.  Am I finished?
You have to tell who it is.
At least make a guess.
I don't know.  Is it Brom Bones?
Certainly not.
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
Forgive me, I didn't know.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
You need some manners.
Brom!
What is this, then... ?
Can I help you, sir?
I have been sent from the city with a letter of introduction. I am told you offer me room and board.
If we could speak alone.
 This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
They're only children, father.
That will be all, ladies.  We are joined by Doctor Thomas Lancaster, Constable.  And to his left are, Clergyman Steenwyck and our able magistrate, Samuel Philipse, both keeping order in their own ways.
I myself am in charge of financial matters and the regulation of currency in our commonwealth.  And, lastly, this fine fellow is James Hardenbrook, our Notary.
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
Excuse me?
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
I was afraid of this.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
The militia?
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
Pardon me?
You have not been well informed of our troubles, sir.  If you would...
The Horseman... he was a Hessian mercenary, sent to our shores by German princes to help keep Americans under the thumb of England.  However, unlike his compatriots who came as muscle in trade for currency, he came willingly.  For love of carnage.
He was infamous for taking his horse, Daredevil, hard into battle... chopping off heads at full gallop.
Just to look on him made your blood run cold, for he had filed down his teeth to rapiers... to add to the ferocity of his appearance.
He would not finally meet his end till the winter of seventy-nine, when New York City was held by Henry Clinton and Washington occupied West Point.  It was between those two places, not far from here...
Cut off his head with his own sword. It's a legend told for twenty years.
But, only recently has the Headless Hessian been seen prowling the Hollow, in search of a head to suit his shoulders.
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
 When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
No one knows why he chose to now to climb out from his grave.
It is very clear why.  Citizens here have long tried to hide sins behind closed doors.  Their failed faith has saturated the soil and called forth one of Satan's own.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Many have.
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
While I will do everything I can to find your assassin, I will look for a man of flesh and blood.  Not some goblin-demon from hell.
Gather round!  Gather and quiet! The hour has come to choose for this night.  Each man's name is in this box and has been checked.
May the Lord watch over him...  "Jonathan Masbath."  Are you here?
I am.  I take my responsibility.
No, father.  Wait...  He's already been up once.  Why does he go again?
It is a lottery, son.  It just as easily might have been one of them.
Then... I go with you.
No.  You obey my wishes.  Brom.  Look after him, will you?
Someone leave him a horse.
You worry for naught, little man. Nothing will harm him there.  It is problems here on the ground you people need begin to worry about.
You will dream.
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
Other people?
Small talk.
It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
My suitor?
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
He has proposed to me twice.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
Come out, devil... come....
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
Are you so superstitious?
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
There is no such thing as magic.
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
 You are funny.
Constable, where are you going!?
Come back, sir...  Madness.
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
And now Jonathan Masbath.
 Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
Van Ripper there...
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
Believe?
It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
You need less big words, and more common sense.
What is that you wear?
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
Well... so much for common sense.
Was this Jonathan's?
Yes.  Seems he panicked across here and broke two legs.
Who took the meat?
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
There's only one Lenape.  He eats small animals and lost children... and the occasional constable when he can get it.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
To place it inside its coffin.
What the hell are you doing?
 You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
I can show exactly.
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
There was not much blood, was there?
I didn't see none.
No bleeding.
What is that?
This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
It instantly burnt the wound shut.
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
I manage fine alone.
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
 Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
 I did not ask you to, did I?
Hail, Constable.  How are you?
Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
 We must be a curious sight to him.
What are you spying on?
 The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
Do you see the Redskinned bastard?
He is a behemoth.
A diseased monster.
If you gentlemen will excuse the doctor and I... we have financial matters to discuss.
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
Find yourself a place in the servants' residence and wake me before dawn. Our first task will be an unsavory one.
It is sacrilege!
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
Magistrate Philipse, surely you can stop this.
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Your superiors are two days away!
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
Why was I not told of this?
The Widow Windsor.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
What is the common thread between these victims?
I'm sure I don't know.
We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.
You should step outside.
The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane. The Lord will not forgive your sins.
Ichabod!  Ichabod... come along.
Sorry for disturbing you.  I thought a forgotten candle was burning.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
These are strange... may I?
These scars.  How did you get them?
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
It would be interesting to find out.
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
Yes, he does.  May I try?
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
You made this, and the drawings?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
If you want.  But...
Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
Thank you.  No.  Here...
I insist that you have it.
 Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
I know it.
Um.... excuse me, sirs...
 Because of the Horseman, our migrant workers flee for their lives.  There is a danger that our crops will rot. So, if you are going to help us, you stop the Horseman.  That is your task... to kill an undead thing.
Listen to what you say....
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
At times I do.
Sirs... please!
What will it take for you to realize this is no laughing matter?
Oh my... oh my oh my oh my...
Philipse!
Don't be afraid... don't be afraid.
No... mother... no... !
The night of the great storm, I saw her cross my windows.
You are certain it was she?
In the lighting, I did see her.  Her.  Lady Crane...
I will never forget.  The next moment, I found my infant dead... with the blood welt on his breast.
The night of the great storm, I saw her cross my windows.
Don't be afraid...
Constable Crane?
Are you hungry?
You promised justice.
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
People have put their trust in you.
They have done nothing of the sort.
Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise?
Constable Crane... something has happened.
We do not need you, Constable...
The men who did this have been taken. We do not need you here.
They spend two days in chains.
Two days... ?  For murder?
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Does that look like an animal hanging?
Looks like an Indian.
Wait.  Give me a moment...
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
How could he?
His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
Where are we going?
Up.
What is it?
It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
 Out there.  What do you see?
The Western Woods.
Look again.
Smoke.  Chimney smoke.
Are you familiar with magnets?
What kind of nuts?
Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
It's spectacular.
 Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
No, I couldn't...
I have others.  All I need is this.
Thank you.
 Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
 Father said witches live there.
Witches do not exist.  However...
Not long ago, I would have said the same for Headless Horseman.
Constable... !
I need to speak with you.  Alone.
Why would you do such a thing?
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
What are you on about?
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
Must I hear this?
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
And this gives worth to butchery?
It was not butchery.
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
To avenge his father, and the others.
But, why?  Tell me why.
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
 If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
What is it?
Listen.
 I hear nothing.
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
We have apparently arrived.
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
You are from the Hollow?
In a way, yes.
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
Were you a friend to the Indian?  You should have this... if you were his friend.
You seek remedy against the Horseman?
 Go out and keep away, child.  You stay.  Follow with me.
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
The Horseman.  Yes.
Sit.
Can you help?
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
What... what are you doing?
 Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
He comes now.
Excuse me... um...
Are you alright... ?
You seek the warrior bathed in blood... the Headless Horseman.
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  Follow to the tree of the dead.
Climb down to the Horseman's soulless place and let loose his silent shrieking.  Do you hear?  Do you hear?!
He who holds fast the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand. Catch hold of his desire.
We are leaving.
What happened?
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
We should not go much further in this murk.
Should we go back?
We are far from the Hollow.  Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
 Do not move.
What God-forsaken hell is this?
Christ...
You all stand idle, while this man goes about with a book of secrets and a bag filled with magic.  You all stand idle, while the shadow of the Devil falls over our town.
I say, if you do nothing, you share in the blasphemy of Ichabod Crane!
Listen to me!  Do you want to save your crops?  Or would you rather see your farms go to ruin?
How is he saving our farms?  How? Ichabod Crane has brought into our midst the soulless, moldering corpse of a heretic!
The wound is neither smooth nor cauterized, but jagged.  She bleeds like a fountain.
She did not go quietly.
Step aside, Constable.  Step aside...
What are you doing?
Let her burn!  Let her burn!
Stop this!  Leave them alone!
Let them go  Are you going to beat an orphaned child, imbecile?
Are you Ichabod Crane's protector, Brom Bones?
Only for the moment.
You side with him in this?
No.  I agree he has only made matters worse.  But, that will change, if you listen.
Theodore, Glenn and I offer to ride each day and night to watch over the Hollow.  We will stalk the border of the Western Woods and haunt the Horseman for a change, with rifles like this... and slugs like this...
Hollowed out and filled with powder.
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
You must have missed your mark.
I hit him square.
 I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
The night of the great storm, I saw her cross my windows.
In the lightning, I did see her.  Her. Lady Crane... I will never forget it.  The next moment, I found my infant son was dead, with the blood welt on his breast.
You have heard it.  The blood welt is the mark of Satan's touch.
She was with me, father.
Nothing can be done against them.
She was with me that night.
May I see her?
Go home.
May I see my mother?
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
She did not do it... please listen...
She is guilty.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
She has confessed.
No.
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
We are leaving.  She has gone away.
She has confessed.
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.
Mother.
Do you know what confession is?
Constable Crane?
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
What troubles you?
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What has happened?
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
What?
She is not your birth mother, is she?
No, but... why do you ask that?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
Why are you so afraid of that?  Is there truly such harm in uncertainty?
Yes, actually.
 Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
Constable... did you notice anything out of the ordinary during the night?
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
I should be going... good day to you.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
 True enough.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Quicken pace.
Ride on.
Halt and turn.  I have a pistol aimed at your head.
It is only me.
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
I apologize if I worried you.
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and...  To thank you.
Come along.
You were right... it does draw attention to itself.
Blood.
What did you say?
What is it?
Stay back.
What are you doing?
Just... keep where you are.
My God... what has happened?
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
We should go.
Why this tree?
 "Climb down to the Horseman's soulless place."  Bring the shovel.
Masbath, we've found it.
It cannot be true.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
The skull is gone.
Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.
This is his silent shrieking... and his desire, to reclaim his head.
"He who holds fast the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand."  Someone controls the Horseman.
Ichabod!
His next victim is chosen!  Give me distance, then guide her back to the Hollow.
Constable!
May I be excused, father?
Do you deserve to be?
 I think so.
 Then, go.
Don't pick teeth.  You teach Thomas bad habits.
I am a bad habit.  There's nothing for it.
 No one knows better than I.
What are you doing there?
Spiders.
Beth...
Beth... run!
 Get out!
Don't let him get you.
Mommy...
You hide now... go...
For what it's worth...
We cannot win this.
There...
Go to the front and guide it.
Let's see him catch us now.
Look.
We'll pass right by the son of a bitch.
My Christ...
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
 What... what are you doing... ?
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
... Brom Bones...
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
Bring Young Masbath here.
You need to sleep.
Bring him.
You need rest.
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
Man or woman?
All I saw was their lantern.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
Damn it.
I'll get it.
Wait...
 Who did this?
Panic has set in.
Sanctuary.  Or, so they hope.
Do you have these persons' wills?
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
Certainly... certainly.
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Hmm?  See them?
May we look at them now?
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
Maybe you should take this.
A fine idea.
What good is this?
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
Damn... damn... damn...
Master Hardenbrook...
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
Well... that might be... helpful.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
 And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
Yes.
Then look here at your father's will, and tell me why you are not listed.
Van Garrett had denoted his elder son in his last wishes; the same son murdered along with him.  But Van Garrett's wife and two infant children are not written... and they were spared.  Do you see?  Philipse had no family to bestow his farm to.  But, here...  The Widow Windsor was listed on her late husband's will.  After her inheritance, she amended the document to include her bastard child.  This is why the Horseman made absolutely certain to impale the unborn descendant.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
In test... what?
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
What does it mean?
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
 Baltus Van Tassel.
Did your father take a loan?
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
Tonight, we answer questions.  And, to discover who moves about the Van Tassel house after dark... all we need is a candle.
 Constable... are you there?  Ichabod?
Midnight seems an appropriate time.
 They are alphabetical.
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
 There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
Keep looking.  Then, hide in my room and bolt the door till I return.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
Lady Van Tassel.
What was she doing?
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
No.  They are all missing.
There is more, though.  While you were gone, I could hear someone else walking through the house.
 Katrina.
Here.
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
What books?
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
But, sir... what books?  Where are they?
If there is a secret place for books... it could be just as good for the missing loan agreements.
Constable.
Fie!  Here they are.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
Where?
Very little.  I must be going...
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
It is fine.  Now, I must...
What... ?
Constable, it is urgent that we speak.
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
How did you hear this?
He came to me.  He promised great violence.  Said I should cast you out for my own protection.  I must speak honestly.  There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
That is the meeting bell already calling.  With the murder of Killian and Brom, no one sees any good from you.  If... if you were to leave... you might be saving your own life.
I appreciate your concern.  I thank you, sir.
 What now?  Where is she?
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
You are astonishing, Constable.  Do you truly think your ridiculous accusations frighten me?
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
They need guidance.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
 Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.
My friends... dear friends.  Those of you still on your farms, I thank you for coming.
I... I address unfortunate business.  I am forced to take my leave from Sleepy Hollow.  I will be moving on to do the Lord's work elsewhere.
Hurry along.  The meeting has most certainly already begun.  We do not want Steenwyck as our enemy.
What is so urgent?
Come with me.
Why have I not seen your face for so long?  You look much better.
Explain these.  I found them secreted away in the sewing room.
Why... why have I scrambled and run and clawed in all directions, only to find you against me?
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
It was you there?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
And, what did he say?
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
What did he say, Katrina?
I have not been able to face him yet.
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
What would you have me believe?
 If you think I am behind this, say it.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
Katrina...
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
Oh, no.  No.  Please... don't dare stand looking as if you still care for me, after all that you have said.  If I were to confess, would that ease your suffering?  Would that make it easier for you to hate me?!
The Horseman is coming!
Save me...
Father?
He killed her...
The Horseman has killed her.
Father!
Steenwyck!
Father!
Damn you, Steenwyck!  Help me! Let me in!
You'll kill us all!
You're the one the Horseman wants. Why should we die for you!?
NO!
Get out!
Stop this!
The Horseman cannot enter!  It does not matter who he wants, he cannot cross the gate!
He's coming back!
We have to save ourselves!
No!  Get away from me!
The next person to lay hands on me will have a bullet.  Stand off!
Father...
No!  We're safe here.  You said it.  The Horseman will not have me.
 Here!  I have found her... (looking at corpse, quiet and miserable) Here she is.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
You will stay at her side?
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Why... why are you like this?
 You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
Half now.  Half when we reach the city.
This is farewell.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
I am sorry.  Forgive me.  I failed you.
Do not go, Constable.  How can you leave?
Sir... this is yours.  The Van Tassel girl said to give it to you after you were gone.
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
What did you say?
Turn around.  Now!
Hello?  Katrina?
Pardon the intrusion...
I never examined these bodies.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
Stains of blood.
What of it?
Jagged flesh.  The Horseman did not do this.
Here, Doctor.  Hold this just so...
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
What?
When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
Katrina.  Is anyone here?
Open the door.  Open up, damn it!  Lady van Tassel is alive.  The Horseman is her puppet.  Please...
Aren't we rid of you?
Listen to me.  Lady Van Tassel has faked her death.  I need able men...
She's dead, and you have gone mad.
No...
 Get out!  Isn't it enough that you have ruined this town?  Go!
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
Yes.  Here...
May I see it?
Get down.  Hurry!
Sorry.
You... you are alive.
She commands the Horseman.
Father saw you die.
Then, whose body was it... ?
No one will believe your lies, whore.
Katrina!
Murderer!
Ichabod!
 Ichabod!
Ichabod!
Here we are!
Climb up!
Lady Van Tassel...
I know.  Hold on.
Christ.
Where are we going?
I do not know.  Away.
Here he comes!
We might make it to the church.
Masbath... !
Damn it, boy, get back here!
What can we do?
Take the reins.
Masbath is right.  We must do something.
Ichabod!
Keep him off!  Block him!
Take it!
Move forward!
Go!
Help her.
What now?
I doubt that's the end.
The church.
He moves too fast.
What was that?
His horse.
There...
He's coming!
Hurry!
It won't hold.
Get up those stairs.  Open the door to the roof and wait.
Ichabod...
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
 Hopefully.
Look out!
Quickly, close it.
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
Jump?  Jump where?
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
I... I can't do this.
We have no choice.
Be ready...
Now!
Okay... come on...
 Oh, no...
Let her go!
No!
Horseman!
How are you?
Tired.
