REDUX
Saigon...shit.  I'm only in Saigon. Every time, I think I'm gonna wake up back in the jungle.
When I was home after my first tour, it was worse.  I'd wake up and there'd be nothing.  I hardly said a word to my wife until I said yes to a divorce.  When I was here, I wanted to be there.  When I was there...all I could think of was getting back into the jungle. I'm here a week now.  Waiting for a mission.  Getting softer.  Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker.  And every minute Charlie squats in the bush...he gets stronger.  Each time I looked around...the walls moved in a little tighter.
Everyone gets everything he wants. I wanted a mission.  And for my sins, they gave me one.  Brought it up to me like room service.
Captain Willard, are you in there?
Yeah I'm coming.
It was a real choice mission.  And when it was over, I'd never want another.
What do you want?
Are you all right, Captain?
What's it look like?
Are you Captain Willard?  505th Battalion?  173rd Air-Borne? Assigned to SOG?
Hey, buddy, you gonna shut the door?
We have orders to escort you to the airfield.
What are the charges?  What did I do?
There's no charges, Captain.
You have orders to report to Com- Sec Intelligence at Nah Trang.
I see.
All right?
Nah Trang, for me?
That's right.
Come on, Captain, you still have a few hours to get cleaned up.
I'm not feeling too good.
Captain?  Dave, come here and give me a hand. We've got a dead one.
Come on Captain, Let's go take a shower.
Don't be an ass.
 Get hold of him good.  We're going to take a shower, Captain.
Stand under this, Captain.
I wanna go to Vietnam. I wanna kill a Vietcong-
I was going to the worst place in the world, and I didn't even know it yet.  Weeks away and hundreds of miles up river that snaked through the war like a circuit cable...plugged straight into Kurtz.
It was no accident that I got to be the caretaker of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz's memory, any more that being back in Saigon was an accident.  There was no way to tell his story without telling my own.  And if his story is really a confession, then so is mine.
 Captain.  Good.  Come on in.
Thank you, sir.
Stand at ease.
General.
 Do you want a cigarette?
No thank you, sir.
 Captain, have you ever seen this gentleman before?
No, sir.  Not  personally.
You've worked a lot on your own, haven't you, Captain?
Yes, sir, I have.
Your report specifies intelligence, counter-intelligence with Com-Sec, I Corps.
I'm not presently disposed to discuss those operations, sir.
Did you not work for the CIA in I Corps?
 No, sir.
Did you not assassinate a government tax collector...Quang Tri province June 18, 1968?
Captain?
Sir, I am unaware of any such activity or operation, nor would I be disposed to discuss an operation, if it did in fact exist, sir.
I thought we'd have a bit of lunch while we talked.  I hope you brought a good appetite, Captain.
I noticed that you have a bad hand there.  Are you wounded?
Had a little fishing accident on R and R, sir.
Fishing on R and R?
Yes, sir.
But you're feeling fit?  You're ready for duty?
Yes, General.  Very much so, sir.
Well, let's see what we have here. Roast beef, and usually it's not bad.  Try some, Jerry.  Pass it around. To save a little time, we might pass both ways.  Captain, I don't know how you feel about this shrimp, but if you eat it, you'll never have to prove your courage in any other way.
 Captain, you've heard of Captain Walter E. Kurtz?
Yes, sir.  I've heard the name.
Jesus...Operations officer, Fifth Special Forces.
Luke, would you play that tape, for the captain, please?  Listen to it carefully, Captain.
"October 9, 04:30 hours, Sector Peter, Victor, King."
These were monitored out of Cambodia.  It's been verified as Colonel Kurtz's voice.
"I watched a small snail, crawling on the edge of a straight razor. That's my dream.  It's my nightmare. Crawling, slithering, along the edge of a straight razor, and surviving."
"Transmission 11, received '68, December 30, 05:00 hours, Sector King, Zulu, King".
"But we must kill them.  We must incinerate them.  Pig after pig. Cow after cow.  Village after village.  Army after army.  And they call me an assassin.  What do you call it, when the assassins accuse the assassin?  They lie. They lie and we have to be merciful, for those who lie.  Those nabobs. I hate them.  I really hate them."
Walter Kurtz was one of the most outstanding officers this country's ever produced.  He was brilliant. He was outstanding in every way. And he was a good man, too.  A humanitarian man.  A man of wit and humor.  He joined the Special Forces, and after that, his ideas, methods, became...unsound.  Unsound.
Now he's crossed into Cambodia with this Montagnard army of his, that worship the man like a god, and follow him every order, however ridiculous.  Well, I have some other shocking news to tell you. Colonel Kurtz was about to be arrested for murder.
I don't follow sir.  Murdered who?
Kurtz had ordered the execution of some Vietnamese intelligence agents. Men he believed were double agents. So he took matters into his own hands.
Well, you see, Willard, in this war, things get confused out there. Power, ideals, the old morality, and practical military necessity. But out there with these natives, it must be a temptation to be God. Because the rational and the irrational, between good and evil. And good does not always triumph. Sometimes, the dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.  Every man has got a breaking point.  You have and I have them.  Walter Kurtz has reached his.  And, very obviously, he has gone insane.
 Yes, sir.  Very much so, sir. Obviously insane.
Your mission is to proceed up the Nung River in a navy patrol boat, pick up Colonel Kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba, follow it, learn what you can along the way.  When you find the colonel, infiltrate his team by whatever means available, and terminate the colonel's command.
 Terminate...the colonel?
He's out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct.  And he is still on the field commanding troops.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
You understand, Captain, that this mission does not exist, nor will it ever exist.
How many people had I already killed?  There were those six that I knew about for sure...close enough to blow their last breath in my face.  But this time it was an American, and an officer.  That wasn't supposed to make any difference to me, but it did.
Shit.  Charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500. I took the mission.  What the hell else was I gonna do?  But I really didn't know what I'd do when I found him.
I was being ferried down the coast in a navy PBR, a type of plastic patrol boat, pretty common sight on the rivers.  They said it was a good way to pick up information, and move without drawing a lot of attention.  That was okay.  I needed the air and the time.  Only problem was, I wouldn't be alone.
The crew were mostly just kids. Rock 'n' rollers with one foot in their graves.  How old are you?
Seventeen.
The machinist, the one they called Chef, was from New Orleans.  He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam. Probably too tight for New Orleans.
Lance, from the forward 50's, was a famous surfer from the beaches south of L.A. To look at him, you wouldn't believe he's ever fired a weapon in his life.
Mr. Clean was from some South Bronx shit-hole, and I think the light and the space of Vietnam really put the zap on his head.
Then there was Phillips, Chief. It might have been my mission, but it sure as shit was the Chief's boat.
 There's about two points where we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River.  They're both hot, belong to Charlie.
Don't worry about it.
Don't smoke.  You know, I've pulled a few special Ops in here.  About six months ago, I took a man who was going past the bridge at Do Lung.  He was regular army, too. I heard he shot himself in the head.
At first, I thought they handed me the wrong dossier.  I couldn't believe they wanted this man dead. Third-generation West Point, top of his class...Korea, Airborne, about a thousand decorations, etc., etc. I'd head his voice on the tape and it really put the hook in me, but I couldn't connect up that voice with this man.  Like they said, he had an impressive career. Maybe too impressive.  I mean, perfect.  He was being groomed for one of the top slots in the corporation.  General, chief of staff, anything.  In 1964, he returned from a tour with Advisory Command in Vietnam, and things started to slip.  His report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.  Seems they didn't dig what he had to tell them.  During the next few months, he made three requests...for transfer to Airborne training, Fort Benning, Georgia...and was finally accepted.  Airborne?  He was thirty-eight years old.  Why the fuck would he do that? 1966...joins Special Forces, returns to Vietnam.
What's that?
Arc light.
What's up?
B-52 strike.
What's that?
Arc light!
I hate that.  Every time I hear that, something terrible happens.
Charlie don't never see them or hear them, man.
There they are!
Concussion'll suck the air out of your damn lungs.
Something terrible is going to happen.
Smoke!  Secondary burning.
Hueys over there.  Lots of Hueys.
Let's have a look Chief.
It was the Air-Cav, First of the Ninth.  That's them.
Our escorts to the mouth of Nung River.  But they were supposed to be waiting for us another thirty kilometers ahead.  Well, Air Mobile. Those boys just couldn't stay put.
First of the Ninth was an old cavalry division that had cashed in its horses for choppers, and gone tear-assign around Nam looking for shit.  They'd given Charlie a few surprises in their time here. What they were mopping up now hadn't even happened yet an hour ago.
Go on, keep going.  It's for television.  Don't look at the camera.
Go on, go on, keep going.  Don't look at the camera.
 Just go by like you're fighting. Don't look at the camera.  It's for television.  Just go through. Just go by.  Keep on going.
Where Can I find the CO?
That's the colonel coming down!
 CO's on that chopper.
Lieutenant, bomb that tree line back about a hundred yards.  Give me some room to breath.
Yes, sir!
Bring me my body cards!
Yes, sir!
I'm the Fourth Tank commander. I've got five tanks broken down.
All right with the tanks.  It's all right, Captain.
Captain Willard.
I carry priority papers from Com- Sec Intelligence, II Corps!  I understand Nah Trang has briefed you on the requirements of my mission.
What mission?  I haven't heard from Nah Trang.
Sir, you're supposed to escort us into the Nung!
We'll see what we can do about that!  Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain!
 All right, let's see what we have. Two of spades.  Three of spades. Four of diamonds, six of clubs...there isn't one worth a jack in the whole bunch.  Four of diamonds...
Hey, Captain, what's that?
Death cards.
What?
Death cards.  Lets Charlie know who did this.
 Cheep up, son.
Fire in the hole!
This is an area that's controlled by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese!  We are here to help you!  We are here to extend a welcome hand to those of you who would like to return to the arms of the South Vietnamese government.
 Get in!  Hurry up!  Move it out!
This is an area that is controlled by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese...
What's this?
This man's hurt pretty bad, sir. About the only thing holding his guts in, sir, is that pot lid.
 Yeah?  What does he have to say?
This soldier is dirty V.C. He wants water.  He can drink paddy water.
Get out of here!  Give me that canteen.
Any man who's brave enough the fight-  Get outta here!  I'll kick you fucking ass!  Any man brave enough to fight with his guts strapped on him can drink from my canteen any day.
Colonel, I think one of those sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.
Where?  Here?  You sure?
Down there.
What's your name, sailor?
 Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson, sir.
Lance Johnson the surfer?
Yes, sir.
Well, it's an honor to meet you Lance.  I've admired your nose riding for years.  Your cutback, too.  I think you have the best cutback there is.
Thank you, Sir.
You can cut out the "sir" crap, Lance.  I'm Bill Kilgore.  I'm a goofy foot.
 I want you to meet some guys. This is Mike from San Diego.  Johnny from Malibu.  We're pretty solid surfers.  None of us are anywhere near your class, though.
No way.
We do a lot of surfing around here, Lance.  I like to finish operations early, fly down to Yung Tau for the evening glass.  Been riding since you got here?
No way.  I haven't surfed since I been here.
Kilgore had a pretty good day for himself.  They choppered in the T- bones and the beer...and turned the L.Z. into a beach party.  The more they tried to make it like hone, the more they made everybody mis it.
 Make my meat rare.  Rare but not cold.
Well, he wasn't a bad officer, I guess.  He loved his boys, and you felt safe with him.  We was one of those guys that had a weird light around him.  You just knew he wasn't going to get so much of a scratch here.
What happened to your mission, Captain?  Nah Trang forget all about you?
Sir, two places we can get into the river.  Here and here.  It's a pretty wide delta, but these are the only two spots I'm really sure of.
That village you're pointing at is kind of hairy, Willard.
What do you mean "Hairy", sir?
It's hairy.  Got some pretty heavy ordinance.  I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
What's the name of that goddamn village, Vin Drin Dop or Lop? Damn gook names all sound the same. (to one of the surfer soldiers) Mike, you know anything about this point at Vin Drin Dop?
That's a fantastic peak.
Peak?
About six foot.  It's an outstanding peak.  It's got both the long right and left side, with a bowl section that's unbelievable.  It's just tube city.
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?  A good peak.  There aren't any good peaks in this whole shitty country.  It's all goddamn beach break.
It's really hairy in there, sir. That's where we lost McDonald. They shot the hell out of us there. That's Charlie's point.
We may not be able to get the boat in.  The draft at the mouth of that river may be too shallow.
We'll pick your boat up and put it down like a baby, right where you want it.  This is the First of the Ninth, Air-Cav, son.  Air mobile! I can take that point and hold it just as long as I like, and you can get any place up that river that suits you, young Captain. Hell, a six-foot peak!  All right. Take a gunship back to division.  Lance, go with Mike and let him pick out a board for you.  And bring me my Yater Spoon, the eight- six.
What is it, soldier?
It's pretty hairy in there.  It's Charlie's Point.
Charlie don't surf!
Jesus, Clean, you ain't believe this.  Look.
Hey!  They're picking up the boat!
 How you feeling, Jimmy?
Like a mean motherfucker, sir!
 All right, son, let 're rip.
I never have got used to a light board.  I can't get used to one. I'm used to a heavy board.
I know, it's a real drag.
You prefer a heavy or light board?
Heavier.
Really?
Yeah.
I thought young guys like lighter boards.
Can't ride the nose on those things.
 Duke Six, this is Eagle Thrust Seven.  We've got it spotted.
Eagle Thrust, put on heading two- seven-zero, assume attack formation.
That's a Roger, Big Duke.  We're going in hot.  Here we go.
 We'll come in low out of the rising sun, and about a mile out, we'll put on the music.
Music?
Yeah, I use Wagner.  Scares the hell ot of the slopes.  My boys love it.
 Hey, they're gonna play music!
How come all you guys sit on your helmet?
So we don't get our balls blown off.
 Eagle Thrust, put on psy war op. Make it loud.  This is a Romeo Fox Trot.  Shall we dance?
 We've spotted a large weapon down below.  We're gonna go down and check it out.
Outstanding, Red Team.  Get you a case of beer for that one.
We're over the village right now. I think I see a vehicle down in the courtyard.  I'm gonna check it out.
Well done, Hawks.  Well done. Want some twenty-Mike-Mike-Vulcan right along those tree-lines. Ripple the shit out of them.
Got a vehicle on the bridge, fifty caliber on-board.  He's moving across to resupply weapon.
Big Duke Six.  Clear the area. I'm coming down myself.  Don't these people ever give up?
 Nice shoot, Bill!
 Un-ass that shit and get it out of here!  It's just a flare, it's alright, it's just a flare. Everybody all right?  Lance, you all right?
I'm fine!
I'm not going!  I'm not going! I'm not going!
We got some secondaries down there in the plaza.
Hold onto your positions.
Duke Six, Duke Six.  We've got wounded down there.
Get a stretcher over here!
Please, God, help me!
Let's give him some morphine.
Zero-three-seven-seven-four-two.
Where's that duster?
 I want my wounded out of there and in the hospital in fifteen minutes. I want my men out.
Somebody stand tight there with Big Duke.
This is Ten-Ten, we're going to be in there and get out.
She's got a grenade!  She's got a grenade!
They blew the shit out of it.
Fucking savages.
Holy Christ, she's a SAP.  I'm gonna get that dink bitch.  Get over there, Johnny.  Out the right skid right up her ass.
We gotta get some air up in these trees.  It's goddamn eat-up with the enemy down there.
What do you think?
It's really exciting, man.
No, no!  The waves!
Oh, right.
Look at that, breaks both ways. Watch.  Look!  Good six-foot swells!
Incoming!
This L.Z. is still pretty hot, sir.  Maybe you ought to surf somewhere else.
What do you know about surfing, Major?  You're from goddamn New Jersey!
I wanna see how rideable that stuff is.  Go change.
It's till pretty hairy out there, sir.
You wanna surf, soldier?
That's good son, because you either surf or fight.  That clear?
One get going.  I'll cover for them.  And bring a board Lance.
 We can't do shit till the boat gets here.
Lance, I bet you can't wait to get out there.
What?
 See how they break both ways?  One guy can break right, one left, simultaneous.  What do you think of that?
Bill, I think we ought to wait for the tide to come up.
Lance, come here.  Look.
Incoming!
The tide doesn't come in for six hours!  You wanna wait here for six hours?
 Okay, fellas, quit hiding.  Let's go, dickheads, take off.
Goddamnit!  Don't you think it's a little risky for R and R?
If I say it's safe to surf this beach Captain, it's safe to surf this beach!  I mean, I'm not afraid to surf this place!  I'll surf this fucking place!
 Give me that R-T, soldier.  Dove Four, this is Big Duke Six. Goddamnit, I want that tree line bombed!
Big Duke Six, Roger.  Dove One- Three, stand by.
 Bomb them into the stone age, son.
No, ma'am, no!
Let me take care of this now. (indicates soldier's rifle) Get that out of here!
 Come here, now.  All right.  Sorry, you can't go!
Jimmy!
Hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three. They need some napalm down there. Can you put it there?
Right, One-Three.  We're fixed to fuck with them.
Trying to suppress some mortar fire off the tree line down there.
Roger.  Here we come.
Good.  Give it all you got and bring in all your ships.  Wing abreast.
 Tell them to get my chopper, get back to the hospital.
No, no . You've got to go with him.  Go!  Go!  Get it out of here!  And tell my guys I want my board!
Big Duke Six, this is Dove One- Three.  The jets are inbound now. They got about thirty seconds to bomb station.  Get your people back.  This is gonna be a big one.
Don't worry.  We'll have this place cleaned up in a jiffy, son.  Give me those shorts.
 These are from the Air-Cav, a present from me and the boys.  I wanna see you do your stuff out there.
You smell that?  Do you smell that?
What?
 Napalm, son.  Nothing else in the world smells like that.  I love the smell of napalm in the morning.  You know, one time we had a hill bombed for twelve hours...and when it was all over, I walked up.  We didn't find one of them, not one stinking dink body.  The smell, you know that gasoline smell?  The whole hill- smelled like-victory.
Someday this war's gonna end.
 Lance!  The wind!  The Wind!  It's blowing onshore!  It's gonna blow this place out.  It's gonna ruin it!
Not cool!
It's the goddamn napalm, that's what's doing it!
I'm really sorry, Colonel, but I'm afraid that does it.  The kid's got a reputation.  You can't expect him to surf those sloppy waves.
I understand what you're saying.
Yeah, I'm an artist, Bill.  I couldn't surf that  crap.
Look, I apologize.  It's not my fault.  The waves are getting blown out by the napalm.  It's the bombs causing a vortex with the wind.
I accept your apology.
Hang around just twenty minutes.
Some other time, Bill.
Just twenty minutes!
I'm an artist!
 Keep walking.
 Let's give it a try, guys.  One goes left and one goes right.  Look, Lance...
You through surfing?  Wanna say good-bye to the colonel?
No!
You sure?
Yeah!
Then let's get the fuck out of here!
 Lance, it's the fucking napalm! Just wait twenty minutes!  Fuck!
 Don't leave without me!
Where the fuck are you going?
Incoming!
That's the colonel's surfboard!
Get the fuck off me!  It's mine!
Chef, light up, man.  Come on, let's get high.
 Wanna smoke?
Light up.
Someday this war's gonna end. That'd be just fine with the boys on the boat.  They weren't looking for anything more than a way home.
Captain?
Trouble is, I'd been back there...and I knew that it just didn't exist anymore.
 Buddha time.
All right.  That's grass.  That's shit.
If that's how Kilgore fought the war...I began to wonder what they really had against Kurtz.  It wasn't just insanity and murder.  There was enough of that to go around for everybody.
I'm not here...I'm walking through the jungle gathering mangos, and I meet Raquel Welch.  I can male nice mango cream pudding.  You know, kind of spread it around on us...
...See, she's into mangoes, too. She's like one limb above me. We're both in the jungle here, nude.
 Hey, Chief?  Here comes that colonel guy again.
"I will not harm or hurt you. Just give me back the board, Lance. It was a good board and I like it. You know how hard it is to find a board that you like."
Determined motherfucker, ain't he? Cock-sucker!
Jesus Christ.  That guy's too fucking much, man.
Do you think he would've shot us?
He would've shot us on the beach, or if he saw me taking his board.
 Let's go surfing now, Everybody's learning how..
Let's get this board out of my turret.
Sucker.
Come on, how am I gonna shoot him the next time he comes around?
Hey, Chef, make some room back there for the board.
I wonder if that's the same chopper.
Hell, he's probably got them all over the river with that recording. We'll have to hold up here till dark, Chief.  Don't worry Lance, he won't follow us too far.
What makes you say that?
You think that Cav colonel wants everyone up river to know we stole his board?
I didn't steak it!
Captain?  Just how far up this river are we going?
That's classified, Chief.  I can't tell you.  We're going up pretty far.
Is it gonna be hairy?
I don't know, kid.  Yeah, probably.
You like it like that, Captain? When it's hot, hairy?
Fuck.  Maybe you'll get a chance to know what the fuck you are in some factory in Ohio.
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go get those mangoes now, okay?
Take somebody with you.
I'll go with him.
Chef?
Yes, sir.
How come they call you that?
Call me what, sir?
Chef.  'Cause you like mangoes and stuff?
No, sir.  I'm a real chef.  I'm a saucier.
Saucier?
Yes, sir.  See, I come from New Orleans.  I was raised to be a saucier.  A great saucier.
What's a saucier?
We specialize in sauces.  Gotta be a mango tree here somewhere...Then, I was supposed to go to Paris, to the Escoffier School.  But then I got orders for my physical.
Well, I joined the navy.  Heard they had better food.  Cook school, that did it.
Oh, yeah?  How's that?
You don't wanna hear about that. They lined us up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib.  All of us, you know, looking at it? Magnificent.  Magnifique.  Next thing, they're throwing the meat into these big cauldrons.
All of it.  Boiling it.  I looked inside, man, it was turning grey. I couldn't fucking believe that one!  That's when I applied for radioman's school, but they-
What is it?  Charlie?
It's a motherfucking tiger!  It's a tiger, man!  A tiger!
Motherfucking tiger!
Battle stations.  Lance, up front. Get on your sixty, Clean.
Fucking tiger!
Let's go!
Chief, you were right.  Never get out of the fucking boat!
Clean, bring that 60 forward.
Never get out of the boat!  I gotta remember!  Gotta remember!  Never get out of the boat!
How many is it?
A fucking tiger!
What?
Tiger!
Tiger?
 I'm done with this goddamn fucking shit!  You can kiss my ass on the county square, because I'm fucking bugging out!  I don't fucking need it!  I didn't get on the goddamn A train for this kind of shit!  All I wanted to do is fucking cook!  I just wanted to learn to fucking cook, man!
You're all right.  You're all right.
All right.  It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right.  Never get out of the boat.  'Bye, tiger! 'Bye tiger!
Never get out of the boat. Absolutely goddamn right.  Unless you were going all the way.
Kurtz got off the boat.  He split from the whole fucking program. How did that happen?  What did he see here that first tour?
Thirty-eight fucking years old. If you joined the green berets, there was no way you'd ever get above colonel.  Kurtz knew what he was giving up.  The more I read and began to understand, the more I admired him.  His family and friends couldn't understand it. And they couldn't talk him out of it.  He had to apply three times, and he put up with a ton of shit, but when he threatened to resign, they gave it to him.  The next youngest guy in his class was half his age.  They must've thought he was some far-out man humping it over the course.  I did it when I was nineteen, it damn near wasted me.  A tough motherfucker.  He finished it.  He could've gone for general, but he went for himself instead.
 Dear Eva.  Today was really a new one.  Almost got eaten by a fucking tiger.  Really un-fucking believable, you know?  We're taking this guy, Captain Willard, up river, but he hasn't told us yet where we're taking him...
October, 1967.  On special assignment, Kontoom Province, Two- Corps...Kurtz staged Operation Archangel with combined local forces.  Rated a major success. He received no official clearance. He just thought it up and did it. What balls.  They were going to nail his ass to the floorboards for that one.  But after the press got a hold of it, they promoted him to full colonel instead.  Oh, man, the bullshit piled up so fast in Vietnam, you needed wings to stay above it.
This sure enough is a bizarre sight in the middle of all this shit.
 Expecting us this time?
Damned if I know.
Jesus Christ...
Hau Phat.  You ever been up here before, Chef?
I bet you could score up here.
Yo, man, check out the bikes, man. Yamaha, Suzuki.
That's a good one.
Yeah, Sukiyaki.
This must be the guy.
Right over there.
Three drums of diesel fuel, PBR- Five...
Move!  We have one hour, that's all!  What do you want?
Can I get some Panama Red?
Panama Red?  Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.
Sergeant.
Destination?
I don't have a destination.
You can't get a goddamn thing without a destination.
Sergeant.
I need a destination.  I can't do a goddamn thing about it.
Hey, Sarge, these guys are with me.  Destination classified.  I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence, II Corps.
Listen, sir, it's a real big night-  Eight dollars for that camera-
Just give them some fuel.
You got it.
Listen, Captain...I'm really sorry about tonight.  It's really bad around here.  Just take this over to the man at the supply desk and you got it.
 Listen, would you guys like some press box seats for the show?  You want those?  The show, man, out here.  The bunnies.
The Playboy bunnies?
Hey, listen, Captain...on the house. No hard feelings.
How you doing out there?  I said how you doing out there?  Wanna say hello to you from all of us up here, to all of you out there, who work so goddamn hard on Operation Brute Force.  Hello, all you Paratroopers out there!  And the Marines!  And the Sailors!  We wanna let you know that we're proud of you, 'cause we know how tough and how hard it's been!  Yeah! And to prove it, we're gonna give you some entertainment we know you're gonna like!
Miss August, Miss Sandra Beatty! Miss Nay, Miss Terri Tersay!  And the Playmate of the year, Miss Carrie Foster!
Hello, out there!
I'm here, baby!  I'm here!
 You fucking bitch!
Sign my centerfold!
 Start her up.  Get the girls!  Let's go!  So long!
Charlie didn't get much U.S.O. He was dug in too deep or moving too fast.  His idea of great R and R was cold rice, and a little rat meat.  He had only two ways home- death, or victory.
No wonder Kurtz put a weed up Command's ass.  The war was being run by a bunch of four-star clowns, who were gonna end up giving the whole circus away.
You know, man, that was far fucking out.  I collected every picture of her since she was Miss December. (showing Clean the centerfold) Hey, Clean, look at that.  She was here, man!  I even wrote to the cunt.  She didn't write me back.
You can get really hung up on these broads, like that cat in the delta.
Yeah.  What cat?
The one that went up for murder? He was an army Sergeant.  This cat, he really dug his Playboy, man.
I mean, this cat, when the thing arrived, he was there to meet it, man!
 Look at these beautiful fucking jugs, man!
Anyway, he was working ARVN patrols, had one of them cocky gook asshole lieutenants, and one day the gook took his magazine and wouldn't give it back!  Cat said "Gimme my magazine back!"  Good said, "You shut up.  I have you court- martialed", you know?
Typical fucking ARVN, man.
The gook went too far.
Chef, take the wheel.
Sticking pinholes and mutilating the centerfold and shit like that. And the sergeant said, "You better not do that to her.  You leave your shitty little gook hands off of that girl!"  Gook say, "Fuck you!"  In Vietnamese, right? Sergeant, man, he just couldn't handle it no more.  He just picked up his iron-
-flipped it to rock 'n' roll and boom!  Gave that little zero a long burst straight through the Playboy mag.  It blew his ass clear out off the dock.  There wasn't no more lieutenant that day.  That was it for his ass.
They burn him for it?
The sergeant?  Yeah, man.  They stuck his ass in the L.B.J. It's too bad he didn't get no medals or nothing.
Fucking ARVN, man.  They should've killed the fuck.  Should've given that fucker a Silver Star.  Bummer for the gook, though, ain't it?
Good morning, Vietnam.  I'm Army Specialist Zack Johnson on A.M.N.V. It's about eighty-two degrees in downtown Saigon right now, also very humid...
...and we have an important message for all G.I.s who are living offbase from the mayor of Saigon.  He's like you to hand the laundry up indoors, instead of the windowsills. The major wants you to keep Saigon beautiful.  And now, here's another blast from the past going out to Big Sam, who's all alone out there with the First Battalion, 35th Infantry, and dedicated by the Fire Team and their groovy C.O. The Rolling Stones, "Satisfaction."
Work out, Clean!  Get down, bubba!  Hang on, Lance!
 Can you dig it, man?  Can you dig it?  I see you're right on target.  Work out!  Yeah!  Yeah!
"Commitment and Counterinsurgency" by Walter E. Kurtz.  "As long as our officers and troops perform tours of duty limited to one year, they will remain dilettantes in war, and tourists in Vietnam.  As long as cold beer, hot food, rock 'n' roll, and all the other amenities remain expected norm, our conduct of the war will only gain impotence.  We need fewer men, and better.  If they were committed, this war could be won with a fourth of our present force."
Shit.  Chicken time.  You ain't shittin', bro. They're motherfuckers.
Who is that?  What's going on?
 Is that you, Lazzaro?
 Don't chicken out.
Chicken!
Fire on the canopy!
I got it!  Get out of there!
Late summer, autumn 1968.  Kurtz's patrol into the highlands is coming under frequent bush.  The camp started falling apart.  November. Kurtz orders assassinations of three Vietnamese men and one woman. Two of the men were colonels in the South Vietnamese Army.  Enemy activity in his old sector dropped off to nothing.  Guess he must have hit the right four people.
 He joined the Special Forces, and after that he...
The army tried one last time to bring him back into the fold.  And if he'd pulled over, it would have been forgotten.
...unsound.
But he kept going.  And he kept winning it his way.
 ...with this Montagnard army of his.
And they called me in.
 ...like a god, and follow every order, however ridiculous.
They lost him.  He was gone. Nothing but rumors and random intelligence, mostly from captured V.C. The V.C. knew his name by now, and they were scared of him. He and his men were playing hit and run all the way into Cambodia.
Clean.
 How long has that kid been on this boat?
Seven months.
He's really specializing in busting my balls.
Very possibly, Captain, he thinks the same of you.
Oh, yeah?  What do you think, Chief?
I don't think.  My orders say I'm not supposed to know where I'm taking this boat, so I don't.  But one look at you and I know it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.
We're going up river, about seventy- five clicks about the Do Lung bridge.
That's Cambodia, Captain.
That's classified.  We're not supposed to be in Cambodia, but that's where I'm going.  You just get me close to my destination, and I'll cut you loose.
All right, Captain.
 "Dear Son.  I'm afraid that both you and your mother will have worried at not hearing from me during the past weeks, but my situation here has become a difficult one.  I have been officially accused of murder by the army.  The alleged victims were four Vietnamese double agents. We spent months uncovering then and accumulating evidence.  When absolute proof was completed, we acted.  We acted like soldiers. The charges are unjustified.  They are, in fact, and under the circumstances of this conflict, quite completely insane."
 "In a war, there are many moments for compassion and tender action. There are many moments for ruthless action.  What is often called ruthless, but may, in many circumstances, be only clarity. Seeing clearly what there is to be done, and doing it directly, quickly, awake.
Request-dust off.  Three, maybe four KIAs.
 "I will trust you tell your mother what you choose about this letter. As for the charges against me, I am unconcerned.  I am beyond their timid, lying morality, and so I am beyond caring.  You have all my faith.  Your loving father.
 Jesus.
No wonder I couldn't get them on the radio.
What a dump.
Hi there!
How you doing?
That's a nice little boat you got there.  Never seen one up here before.
We called in a request for a medevac.  You guys didn't receive it?
Medevac?  No.
We passed a downed Huey with some KIAs.
On your way here?
Yeah.
 You going up this river?
Way up.
Way up river?  Forget it.
Why?
We wanna send some people down river.  Just forget it.
 What the fuck was that?
 We'll be back in a couple of days.
Yeah, right, you'll be back.
Chief?
Yeah, Captain.
See what you can do with that engine.  I'm gonna have a look around.  And don't leave without me.
Hey, solder, where's your C.O.?
Don't ask me, man.
Hey, guys, where's your C.O.?
He stepped on a land mine about two months ago.  Got all blown to hell.
Who's in charge here?
Charge?  I don't know man.  I'm just the night man.  Just doing what I'm told.  I'm just a working girl.
 What about you, fella?
Lance, man, I'm telling you it's gonna jam.  You mark my words.
Get off my back!
Hey, you!  Come here!
Come here.  Is that your boat? Come on inside.
What do you want?
Come on inside, I want to talk to you.  Come on.  Get out of the rain.
Come on, cut the shit.  Come on.
How you doing, Captain?  I want you to meet some people.
Hey, guys.  Hey, fellas.  Guys?
I just made a deal with people from Hau Phat.  I negotiated two barrels of fuel for a couple of hours with the bunnies.
You shittin' me?
No, I'm not.  Grab a couple of barrels and get up to that big tent.  Come on!
Captain.  You're giving away fuel for a Playmate of the month?
No.  Playmate of the Year, Chief. (he takes a drink from a bottle)
Captain, we get in a fire fight and run out of fuel, I want you to tell me how she was.
I made a deal for all of us, Chief. How about you?
You got some mamas in there?
Some what?
 Forget it, Captain.  I'll stay with the boat.
Hey, Captain, give me a hand!
You know, I got every one of your pictures...
I got the centerfold, the Playmate's Review, the Playmate of the Year runoff.  I even got the calendar. Hey, oiseau!  How come you got a bird?
I used to be the bird girl at Busch Gardens.
Busch Gardens?
Yeah, I used to train birds there.
You are Miss December, aren't you?
Miss May.
Is it coming?
Miss December has black hair.
It's over there.
He's not one of my regular birds.  Come on, baby.  Snatch your cracker. Come here.
Being Playmate of the Year is the loneliest experience I can imagine. It's like you try to express your feelings to someone, and show them your heart...
Yeah, I'd love to see your bird act, but would you mind just putting this-would you just mind putting this wig on for me, please?
...and there's this glass wall between you, this invisible glass, and they can see your mouth moving.
I used to train birds for at least two years at Busch Gardens.
This was cascading over your shoulder.  This was open here.
...but they can't hear what you're saying.
...I used to train then to stand on their head, fly upside down, and ride little bicycles...
Your right hand was over there...
Hey, Chef!
Get out of there, man!
Later!  Later!  Give me fifteen minutes.
You can never really make them hear what you're trying to say...
You were kind of bending.  Yeah, your ass was just kind of...
Hey man, fuck off!  Fifteen minutes!
That's why I tried so desperately to show somebody that I had some talent.
Little baby Macaws.  Have you ever seen a baby Macaw?  They're beautiful.
 Come on, man, take off!
I got my rights, man!
They make you do things that you don't want to do.  Like this picture here.
I started feeling repulsed with myself...
You were just kind of bending forward, you ass kind of out.
I love training birds...
That's it.
...I really do.
That's it!  Viola!  Beautiful.
You know, I can't believe it.  Me, J. Hicks.  I can't believe I'm really here, you know.
...Maybe I'm unfit to have a relationship with a beautiful, innocent boy.
Just think, if it hadn't been for the Vietnam War, I'd never would've met you, Miss December.
Miss May.
I wish I could find just one person that could share my point of view.
You kiss like a bird!  Oh, God! Kiss me!
I love birds!
Like a bird!  Take me like a bird! Fly baby!  What are you doing?
I can fly like an eagle!
Like an eagle, baby!  Cock it to me!  Oh, you drive me crazy!
Lance, that was somebody's son...Lance, there were things that they made me do, that I didn't want to do.  But they said, "Pull the ribbons between your legs," and I didn't want to do it.  But they said that was what was expected of me, that what people wanted to see.
Who are you?
I'm next, ma'am.
 Well, I didn't know you never got no pussy!
Shut the fuck up!
Sure sorry about that.  If I had known, I would have taken you to New Orleans.  Teach you some of the moves.
Lay off, Chef!
Cherry boy, Cherry boy.
You're fucking dumb!
We'll go to New Orleans.  I'll get you fixed up, you prick.
Lay off, Chef.
You're the only prick I see around here.  If I wanna play with a prick, I'll play with my own.
You wouldn't know what to do with it!
Chef, I said lay off!  Knock it off!  Give him a break!  What do you think I said?  And give your jaws a rest.  And this ain't the army!  You are a sailor.  So get out of that frizzly army-looking shirt and stop smoking that dope, you hear me?
Lance, what's with all the green paint?
Camouflage.
How's that?
So they can't see you.  They're everywhere.  Chief.
Uh-huh.  I want you to stay awake up there, man.  You got a job to do.
Sampan off the port bow.  Sampan off the port bow.  Let's take a look.
Lance, bring them in.  Clean, on the 60.  Chef, get a 16.  Clean, get on that 60!
What's up, Chief?
A junk boat, Captain.  We're gonna take a routine check.
Let's forget routine now, and let them go.
These boats are running supplies in this delta, Captain.  I'm gonna take a look.
Chief, my mission's got priority here.  Hell, you wouldn't even be in this part of the river, if it wasn't for me.
Until we reach your destination, Captain, you're just on for the ride.
All right, come on, let's bring it over.  Look in that forward hooch. Bring the people out of there.
Hurry up, motherfuckers!  Move it! Can couc!
Keep your eyes open, Clean.
 I got you Chief.
Board it and search it.
There ain't nothing on it, Chief.
Board it and search it.
Just baskets and ducks.  Bananas. There ain't nothing on it.
Go on it and search it.
Just a goat.  Some fish.  Bunch of fucking vegetables.
Get on that boat!
There's nothing on it, man!
Get on that boat!
 Move it, asshole.
Pigs!  Mangoes!  What's in the rice bag?  Fucking rice!
Well, look in there, Chef!
Fucking fish!  More coconuts. Rice.  Here's rice.
What's in that vegetable basket?
 Can couc!  Come on!  Get out of there.
Check that vegetable basket.
All right!
Shut up, slope!
There ain't nothing in here.
What's in the boxes?  Look in that tin can.  That rusty can.
Just fucking rice, that's all! There ain't nothing in it!
Check that yellow can.  She was sitting on it.  What's in it?
Motherfuckers!
 Let's kill them all!
Fucking cocksucker motherfuckers!
Hold it!  Hold it!
Let's kill all the assholes!
Chef, hold it!  Hold it!
 ...why not?
Clean?
I'm good.
You okay, Lance?
Shit!  Fuck!
Chef?
Look what she was hiding.  She what she was running for?
A fucking puppy!  A puppy.
Gimme that dog!  Gimme that dog!
No, you're not gonna get it!
Give me the fucking dog, asshole!
Fuck you!  Fucking mango, too! You want that?
Chef, she's moving behind you. She's alive.  Check her out.
Come on, Clean, goddamnit, give me a hand!
She's not dead.  She's moving.  Let's take it easy.  Take it easy. Slow down and take it easy.
Bring her up.
Is she breathing, Chef?
She's hurt.  She's bleeding.
Bring her onboard.  We're taking her to an ARVN.
What are you talking about?
We're taking her to some friendlies. She's wounded, she's not dead.
Get out of there, Chef.
The book says, Captain-
Fuck you.  Fuck them.
I told you not to stop.  Now let's go.
It was a way we had over here of living with ourselves.  We'd cut them in half with a machine gun, and give them a Band-Aid.  It was a lie.  And the more I saw of them, the more I hated liars.  Those boys were never gonna look at me the same way again, but I felt like I knew one or two things about Kurtz, that weren't in the dossier.
Do Lung bridge was the last army outpost on the Nung River.  Beyond it there was only Kurtz.
Hey, Lance, what do you think?
It's beautiful.
What's the matter with you?  You're acting kind of weird?
You know that last tab of acid I was saving?
Yeah.
I dropped it.
You dropped acid?  Far out.
Take me home!  Goddamn you!
Get away from this boat.
You'll get what you deserve!
Is there a Captain Willard on board? Captain Willard?
Yeah!  Who's that?
Lieutenant Carlson, sir.  Get that light off me!
I was sent here from Nah Trang with these three days ago, sir. Expected you here a little sooner.
This is mail for the boat.  You don't know how happy this makes me, sir.
Why?
Now I can get out of here, if I can find a way.
You're in the asshole of the world, Captain!
Captain, where you going?
To see if I can find some fuel and get some information.  Pick me up on the other side of the bridge.
 Somebody go with him.  Chef.
I'll go.  I want to go.
Where can I find the C.O.?
You can right to it, son of a bitch!
Lance!  Get down here!
You still got a commanding officer her?
Beverly Hills.
What?
Right up the road there's a concrete bunker called Beverly Hills.  Where the fuck else do you think it would be?
You stepped in my face!
We thought you were dead.
Well, you thought wrong, damnit!
 I told you to stop fucking with me!  You think you're so bad, huh, nigga?
What are you shooting at, soldier?
Gooks!  What the fuck do you think I'm shooting at? (turns and sees it's an officer) I'm sorry, sir.  There are gooks out there by the wire.  But I think I killed them all.
You ain't shot shit!  Listen!
Oh, shit, he's trying to call his friends.  Sen up a flare.
You think you so bad, nigga?  You think you so bad?
They're all dead, stupid.  There's one still alive underneath them bodies.
Who's the commanding officer here?
Ain't you?  You think you so bad?  I got something for your ass!  I got something for you now!
There's nothing but bodies, man!
 Go get the Roach, man.  Go get the Roach, nigga!
 Roach!  Roach!
Lance!
Do you hear them?  Well, bust them!
Hey, G.I., fuck you!
You hear him out there on the wire, man?
Yeah.
Fuck you, you G.I.
You need a flare?
No.  He's close, man.  He's real close.
G.I., fuck you!
Motherfucker.
Hey, soldier.  Do you know who's in command here?
Yeah.
Holy shit!  Yo, Chief, two guys just got blown off that bridge,
You hand on, man.  You're gonna be okay.
What's that?
Mail, man!
Later on the mail!  Watch them trees.
There's no diesel fuel, but I picked up some ammo.  Let's move out.
Did you find the C.O., Captain?
There's no fucking C.O. here. Let's just get going.
Which way, Captain?
You know which way, Chief.
You're on your own, Captain.  Still want to go on?  Like this bridge. We build it every night, Charlie blows it right back up again, just so the generals can say the road's open.  Think about it...who cares?
Just get us up river!
Chef.  On the bow.  Stand by, Clean.
Shit, you got another one, Clean!
No shit.  Wait a minute.  Is that it?
That's it for you.  Lance?  Mr. L. B. Johnson, there you go.
Far out, man!  All right, I been waiting for this one.
 I got another one.  I got a box from Eva.
 "Lance, I'm fine.  Sue and I went tripping in Disneyland.  Sue skinned her knee.
Man, I'm gonna get back to Antoine's.
 How could I fucking forget, man? Beautiful!  "There could never be a place like Disneyland, or could there?  Let me know."  Jim, it's here.  It really is here.
 "There has been a new development regarding your mission, which we must one communicate to you.  Months ago, a man was ordered on a mission, which was identical to yours.  We have reason to believe that he is now operating with Colonel Kurtz. Saigon was carrying him MIA for his family's sake, but they assumed he was dead.  Then they intercepted a letter he tried to send to his wife."
Captain Richard Colby.  He was with Kurtz.
 Disneyland.  Fuck, man, this is better than Disneyland.
 "...Charles Miller Manson ordered the slaughter of all in the home anyway, as a symbol of protest." That's really weird, ain't it?
Purple Haze!  Look!
Lance, put that smoke away.
I got a tape from my mom.
Chief, rainbow reality, man.  Get a good whiff.
Eva can't picture me in Vietnam. She pictures me at home, having a beer, watching TV.
Hey, Lance, man!
 Hot potato!  Hot potato
Eve's not sure she can have a relationship with me.  Here I am, thirteen thousand fucking miles away, trying to keep a relationship with my ass.
"...and that's much more that I can say for some of your friends. If this tape is any good, I will have Dad and the family send you a tape of their own.
Chef!  Take care of Clean!  Captain, Clean's hit!  He's hit!
Where'd the dog go?  Where's the dog?  We gotta go back and get the dog!
Clean!  Hey!  Bubber, you can't die!  You fucker!  Hey, bubber!
"I'll have a lot of grandchildren to love and spoil, and then when your wife gets them back, she's be mad with me.  Even Aunt Jessie and Mama will come to celebrate your coming home.  Granny and Dad are trying to get enough money to get you a car.  But don't tell them, because that's our secret. Anyhow..."
"...do the right thing, stay out of the way of the bullets, and bring your hiney home ask in one piece...'cause we love you very much.  Love, Mom."
 Hold on.  Throw me the glasses.
Lance.  Get the 16 on the bow.  Chef, on the 60.
Lance, cover the Captain.
You are surrounded.  Return.  Drop your weapons.
 Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  They're French. (n French, to soldiers) I am dropping my weapon!
Chef!  Pick up that weapon!  Pick it up!  Stand fast!
We are Americans!  We are friends.
Drop your weapons!
 All right, you men.  Put down your weapons.
 We are Americans.  We are friends. We are friends.
We lost one of our men.
We French always pay respect to the dead of our allies.  You're all welcome.  Y name is Hubert DeMarais.  This is my family's plantation.  It has been such for seventy years, and it will be such until we are all dead.
To my command!  Attention!  Weapons on the shoulder!  Present weapons!
 Captain, accept the flag of Tyrone Miller, on behalf of a grateful nation.
This food is really wonderful, isn't it?  The wine, the sauces. I can't believe it.  Can I speak with the chef?
The chef speaks only Vietnamese.
No kidding.  He cooks like this and he can't even speak French?  Hey, Lance, the chef's a slope.
Hey, Lance...
 You still need to study with Mr. Robert.  Let's go.  Not too bad. Go to bed everyone now.
This is Baudelaire.  It is a very cruel poem for children, but they need it, because life sometime is very cruel.
As you can see.  Attack repels by the family.
Just for this war
 Vietcong, fifty-eight.  North Vietnamese, twelve.  South Vietnamese, eleven.
Americans, six?
Yes, well, there were perhaps mistakes.
 Roxanne, you were curious to see these Americans, weren't you?
 No, I was only hungry.
May I present Captain Willard, he is of a Paratroop regiment.  Madame Sarrault.
Captain.
 "An angel passes..."
 "...Let's butcher it!"  Do you remember this story in Paris, when the baron said, "Let's cut the angel?"
 I don't think that is the subject tonight.
I'm sorry, Captain.  It was just a little story.  And people starving during the war.  They are all around the table, and there was a silence, somebody say "An angel is passing by." So somebody say "Let's eat it!" 
How long can you possibly stay here?
We stay forever.
No, no, I mean, why don't you go back home to France?
This is our home, Captain.
Sooner or later, you're --
No!
 You don't understand our mentality! The French officer mentality!  At first, we lose in Second World War.  I don't say that you Americans win, but we lose.
Oh, Papa.
When I speak, you shut up!  In Dine Bien Phu, we lose!  In Algeria, we lose!  In Indochina, we lose.  But here, we don't lose! This piece of earth, we keep it! We will never lose it!  Never!
And now you take French place, and the Viet Minh fight you.  And what can you do?  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.
The Vietnamese are very intelligent. You never know what they think. The Russian ones who help them, "Come and give us their money, we are all Communists.  Chinese, come and give us guns.  We're all brothers." They hate the Chinese! Maybe they hate the American less that the Russian and the Chinese. If tomorrow the Vietnamese are Communists, they will be Vietnamese Communists.  And this is something that you will never understand, you American.
I don't know.  Maybe in the future we can make something with the Viet Minh.
Don't you understand?  The V.C. say, "Go away!  Go away!"  That's finish for all the white people in Indochina.  If you're French, American, that's all the same. "Go!"  They want to forget you. Look, Captain --
Come on, Philippe.  It's enough now.
Look, this is the truth...
An egg, the white leaves, but the yellow stays!
 Come on, stay with us.  What's going on?
 They don't want to face the truth.
When I was in Saigon, I spoke to an American politician, and he explained it very well.  He said, "Look, Yesterday it was Korea, today Vietnam, tomorrow Thailand, the Philippines, then maybe Europe."
Come on, why not Europe?  Look what happened in Czechoslovakia recently.  And even before the Second World War, the Americans knew exactly what was going on! They don't want that shit to take over! (to LaFavre, who is playing the accordion) LaFavre!  LaFavre, stop it!
All you white people are shit.
They are fighting.  Fighting for freedom.
Freedom?  Bullshit.  French bullshit.  American bullshit.  Dine Bien Phu, that's serious! All soldier know they are already dead.  You know anything about Dine Bien Phu?
Yeah, I know.
No, you don't.  Not really.
A milliary mistake.
A mistake?  A voluntary mistake! Voluntary!
All the soldiers knew, we knew we would be dead.
The generals and the colonels believe it's impossible for the Viets to get the cannon up there in the mountain.  But they do. Then they wait for the rain to come.  When it comes, no airplane can fly there, and our paratroopers jump at ninety meters!  I mean, you know, ninety meters!  Seventy meters!  That's crazy!  Nobody in the world can do that!  And they only do that to be dead with their friends.
The French Army sacrificed. Sacrificed by politicians safe at home.  They put the army in an impossible situation where they couldn't win!
You exaggerate.
The students are marching in Paris, protesting, demonstrating.  They stab the soldiers in their back! The soldier would open a grenade, it wouldn't work.  A piece of paper would fall, "Union of the French Woman." "We are all for the Viets." Traitors!  Communist traitors at home!
Dine Bien Phu, okay.  The French is shit.  No one care.  No one want to--
You are bothering me, LaFavre!  Why don't you Americans learn from us, from our mistakes?  My God, with your army, your strength, your power...you could win if you wanted to!
 Be kind and help this poor LaFavre who fell, please.
 You can win!
You know, I'm sure we can make something here.  I'm sure about it, you know?  I never do something wrong to the people here.
That's right, but the Communists at home have never been traitors.
No, never traitors.  For me, Mendes- France was a Communist.
Mendes-France was a Socialist.
He was Communist!  That's it!
Socialist.
How do you want the government to win when it is Communist?
Communists have always worked for peace wherever they are.
They killed the French Army, which was the strongest.  Destroyed because of who?  The Communists.
The army damaged itself by its attitude toward the people here.
And why do you think that it did that?  Because it understood it had been sacrificed by the Communist government.
Socialist.
Communist.
Captain, good night.
 Mendes-France was a Socialist.
We can stay.  I know we can stay. You know, we always helped the people, we work with the people.
Come on, we are leaving.
So we can be friends, we are agreed.
See, Captain, when my grandfather and my uncle's father came here, there was nothing.  Nothing.  The Vietnamese were nothing.  So we worked hard, very hard, and brought the rubber from Brazil, and then plant it here.  We took the Vietnamese, work with them, make something, something out of nothing. So when you ask me why we want to stay here, Captain, we want to stay here because it's ours, it belongs to us.  It keeps out family together.  We fight for that! While you Americans, you are fighting for the biggest nothing in history.  I'm sorry Captain.  I will see if your men needs any help to repair your boat, so that you can go on with your war.  Good night, Roxanne.
I apologize for my family, Captain. We have all loots much here.  Hubert- his wife and two sons.  And I have lost a husband.
I understand.
You are tired of the war.  I can see it in your face.  It was the same in the eyes of the soldiers of our war.  We called them "Les Soldat Perdus." The Lost Soldiers  If you like we can have some cognac.
No, I have to see about my men and...
The war will still be here tomorrow.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I noticed you had no wine at dinner.
No, I don't drink wine.  I do like cognac, but I don't want any now, thank you.
Well, then I must drink alone,. Then.
Will you go back after the war to America?
No.
Then you're like us, your home is here.
Do you know why you can never step into the same river twice?
Yeah.  Because it's always moving.
I used to prepare a pipe for my husband.  It was morphine he took for the wounds he suffered in his heart.
He would rage and he would cry, my lost soldier.  And I said to him, "There are two of you, don't you see?  One that kills and one that loves." And he said to me, "I don't know whether I am animal or a god." But you are both.
You want more?
All that matters is that you are alive.  You are alive, Captain. That's the truth.
There are two of you, don't you see?  One that kills...and one that loves.
Can't see nothing.  We're stopping.
You're not authorized to stop this boat, Chief.
I said I can't see a thing, Captain! I'm stopping this boat!  I ain't risking no more lives!
I'm in command here, goddamnit. You'll do what I say!
 You see anything, Chef?
Why don't they fucking attack, man?
Watch it over there, Chief.  Got a stump.
Lance, on the fifties.
He was close.  He was real close. I couldn't see him yet, but I could feel him, as if the boat were being sucked up river and the water was flowing back into the jungle. Whatever was going to happen, it wasn't going to be the way they called it back in Nah Trang.
Arrows!
Fire!  Chef, open fire!  Fire! Lance!  Fire!
Chef!  Chef, it's okay!  Quit firing!  They're just little arrows. Cut it out!  Quiet!  Chief, tell them to hold their fire!  They're just little sticks!  They're trying to scare us!
You got us in this mess, and now you can't get us out, because you don't know where the hell you're going, do you?  Do you?  You son of a bitch!  You bastard!
 Lance, get the wheel!
You savages!  Come and get it, you son of a bitches!
A spear?
My mission is to make it up to Cambodia.  There's a Green Beret colonel up there who's gone insane, and I'm supposed to kill him.
That's fucking typical!  Shit! Fucking Vietnam mission!  I'm short and we gotta go up there so you can kill one of our own guys? That's fucking great!  That's just fucking great, man!  Shit!  That's fucking crazy!  I thought you were going to blow up a bridge, or some fucking railroad tracks, or something!
That's all right.
No, wait.  We'll go together.  On the boat.  We'll go with you. We'll go out there.  But on the boat, okay?
Part of me was afraid of what I would find, and what I would do when I got there.  I knew the risks. Or imagined I knew.  But the thing I felt the most, much stringer than fear, was the desire to confront him.
 Just keep moving.  Lance, keep your hands away from the guns.
It's all right!  It's all right! It's been approved!
I ain't coming in there!  Them bastards attacked us!
Zap 'em with your siren, man.  Zap 'em with your siren.
There's mines over there!  Mines over there, too!  And watch out, those goddamn monkeys bit you, I tell you.
Move it in right toward me.
I'm an American.  An American civilian.  Hi, Yanks.  Hi. American.  American civilian. It's all right.  And you got the cigarettes, and what's what I've been dreaming of.
 Who are you?
Who are you?  I'm a photojournalist. I've covered the war since '64. I've been in Loas, Cambodia, 'Man... (looking around the boat) I'll tell you one thing.  This boat is a mess, man.
 Who are all these people?
They think you've come to take him away.  I hope that isn't true.
Take who away?
 Him!  Colonel Kurtz!  These are all his children, man, as far as you can see.  Hell, man, out here, we are all his children.
Could we talk to Colonel Kurtz?
Hey, man, you don't talk to the Colonel.  Well, you listen to him.
The man's enlarged my mind.  He's a poet-warrior in a classic sense. I mean, sometimes he'll-well, you say hello to him, right?  And he'll just walk right by you and he won't even notice you.  And then suddenly he'll grab you and he'll throw you in a corner and he'll say "Do you know that the 'if' is the middle word in 'life'?  If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you.  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you." I'm a little man, I'm a little man. He's a great man.  "I should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across floors of silent seas."
Stay with the boat.
Don't go without me, okay.  I want to get a picture.
He can be terrible, and he can be mean, and he can be right.  He's fighting the war.  He's a great man.  I mean, I wish I had words you know?  I wish I had words.  I could tell you something like, the other day he wanted to kill me.
Why did he want to kill you?
Because I took his picture.  He said, "If you take my picture again, I'm going to kill you." And he meant it.  See, just lay cool, lay cool.  Lay back, dig it.
He gets friendly again, he really does.  But you don't judge the colonel.  You don't judge the colonel like ordinary men.
Okay, watch it now!  These are Americans!  Americans!  You can feel the vibe of this place. Let me take a picture.  Hey, could you hold it?  Hello?  Could you hold it for a minute?
Colby?
The heads.  You're looking at the heads.  Sometimes he goes too far, and he's the first one to admit it.
He's gone crazy.
Wrong!  Wrong!  If you could have heard the man just two days ago, if you could've heard him then. God.  You were gonna call him crazy?
Fucking A.
I just want to talk to him.
Well, man, he's gone away.  He disappeared out in the jungle with his people.
I'll wait for him.
He feels comfortable with his people.  He forgets himself with his people.  He forgets himself.
Captain, maybe we should wait back at the boat.
 Okay, Chef, we'll go back to the boat for a while.
Yeah.  Stay with Lance.
This colonel guy, he's wacko, man. He's worse than crazy, he's evil! That's what the man's got set up here, man!  It's fucking pagan idolatry!  Look around you!  Shit, he's loco.
Then you'll help me?
Fucking A, I'll help you.  I'll do anything to get out of this joint! We could blow all them assholes away!
They're so fucking spaced out, they wouldn't even know it.  I ain't afraid of all them fucking skulls and altars and shit!  I used to think that if I died in an evil place, then my soul wouldn't make it to heaven.  But now...fuck. I don't care where it goes, as long as it ain't here.  So what do you want to do?  I'll kill the fuck.
 No, no.  I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.  I'll go up with Lance and scrounge around, check the place out, see if I can find the colonel, okay?
But what do you want me to do? Damnit.
Here, you take the radio, and if I don't get back by 22:00 hours, you call in the air strike.
Air strike?
The code is "Almighty," coordinates zero-nine-two-six-four-seven-one- two.  It's all in there.
Everything I saw told me that Kurtz had gone insane.  The place was full of bodies.  North Vietnamese, Vietcong, Cambodians...If I was still alive, it was because he wanted me that way.
It smelled like slow death in there. Malaria and nightmares.  This was the end of the river, all right.
Where you from, Willard?
I'm from Ohio, sir.
Were you born there?
Yes, sire.
Whereabouts?
Toledo, sir.
How far are you from the river?
The Ohio River, sir?  About two hundred miles.
I went down that river once when I was a kid.  There's a place in the river, I can't remember...must have been a gardenia plantation, or a flower plantation at one time. It's all wild and overgrown now. But for about five miles, you'd think that heaven just fell on the earth, in the form of gardenias.
Have you ever considered, any real freedoms?  Freedoms from the opinions of others.  Even the opinions of yourself.  Did they say why, Willard?  Why they wanted to terminate my command?
I was sent on a classified mission, sir.
Its no longer classified, is it. What did they tell you?
They told me, that you had gone...totally insane.  And that your methods were unsound.
Are my methods unsound?
I don't see any method at all, sir.
I expected someone like you.  What did you expect?  Are you an assassin?
I'm a soldier.
You're neither.  You're an errand boy, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.
Why?  Why would a nice guy like you want to kill a genius?  Feeling pretty good, huh?  Why?  Do you know that the man really likes you?
He likes you.  He really likes you.  But he's got something in mind for you.  Aren't you curious about that?  I'm curious.  I'm very curious.  Are you curious?
There's something happening out here, man.  You know something, man?  I know something you that you don't know.  That's right, Jack . The man is clear in his mind, but his soul is mad.  Oh, yeah.  He's dying, I think.  He hates all this.  He hates it!  But the man's a...He reads poetry out loud, all right?  And a voice...he likes you 'cause you're still alive. He's got plans for you.  No, I'm not gonna help you.  You're gonna help him, man.  You're gonna help him.  I mean, what are they gonna sat when he's gone?  'Cause he dies when it dies, when it dies, he dies!  What are they gonna say about him?  He was a kind man?  He was a wise man?  He has plans?  He has wisdom?  Bullshit, man!  Am I gonna be the one that's gonna set them straight?  Look at me!  Wrong!  You!
 Almost eight hours.  I'm asleep. I'm asleep and dreaming I'm on this shitty boat.  Fuck.  Has it been eight hours?
 Hello, Almighty.  Almighty.  This is PBR Street Gang.  Radio check, over.
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty standing by, over.
Oh, Christ!
 "Time magazine.  The weekly news magazine.  September 22, 1967, volume ninety, number twelve.  The War on the Horizon.  The American people may find it hard to believe that the U.S. is winning the war in Vietnam.  Nevertheless, one of the most exhaustive inquiries into the status of the conflict yet compiled, offers considerable evidence that the weight of U.S. power, two and a half years after the bug buildup began, is beginning to make itself felt.  White House officials maintain the impact of that strength may bring the enemy to the point where he could simply be unable to continue fighting."  Is this familiar?
 "Because Lyndon Johnson fears that the U.S. public is in no mood to accept its optimistic conclusions, he may never permit the report to be released in full.  Even so, he is sufficiently impressed with the findings, and sufficiently anxious to make their conclusions known, to permit experts who have been working on it to talk about it in general terms."  No date, Time Magazine.  "Sir Robert Thompson, who led the victory over the Communists guerrillas in Malay, and who is now a RAND Corporation consultant, recently returned to Vietnam to sound out the situation for President Nixon.  He told the president last week that things felt much better, and smelled much better over there."
 How do they smell to you, soldier?
You'll be free.  You'll be under guard.  Read these at your leisure. Don't lose them.  Don't try to escape, you'll be shot.  We can talk of these things later.
 "We are the hollow men and the stuffed men together filled with straw.  Alas dried voices, when whisper together quiet and meaningless wind in dried rats' feet over broken glass our dry cellar."
He's really out there.
 "Shape without form, shade without color, force, gesture without motion;"
Do you know what the man's saying? Do you?
 "Those who have crossed direct eyes..."
This is dialectics.  It's very simple dialectics.  It's one through nine, no maybes, no supposes, no fractions.  You can't travel in space.  You can't go out into space, without like, you know, with fractions.  What are you gonna land on?  One quarter?  Three- eighths?  What are you gonna do when you go from here to Venus? That's dialectic physics, okay? Dialectic logic is, there's only love and hate.  You either love somebody, or you hate them.
Mutt!  You mutt!
This is the way the fucking world lives.  Look at this fucking shit we're in, man!  Not with a bang, Whimper.  And with a whimper I'm fucking splitting, Jack.
On the river, I thought that the minute I looked at him, I'd know what to do.  But it didn't happen. I was in there with him for days. Not under guard.  I was free.  But he knew I wasn't going anywhere. He knew more about what I was going to do at I did.  If the generals back in Nah Trang could see what I saw, would they still want me to kill him?  More than ever, probably. And what would his people back home want, if they ever learned just how far from them he'd really gone.  He broke from them, and then he broke from himself.  I'd never seen a man so broken up and ripped apart.
I've seem horrors.  Horrors that you've seen.  But you have no right to call me a murderer.  You have a right to kill me.  You have a right to do that.  But you have no right to judge me.
It's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means. Horror.  Horror has a face.  And you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends.  If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies.
I remember when I was with Special Forces.  Seems a thousand centuries ago.  We went into a camp to inoculate some children.  We'd left the camp after we had inoculated the children for polio. And this old man came running after us, and he was crying.  He couldn't say.  We went back there, and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm.  They they were, in a pile.  A pile of little arms. And, I remember, I cried, I wept like some grandmother.  I wanted to tear my teeth out.  I didn't know what I wanted to do.  And I want to remember it.  I never want to forget it.  I never want to forget it.  And then I realized, like I was shot, like I was shot with a diamond bullet through my forehead.  And I thought, My God, the genius of that!  The genius. The will to do that.  Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure.  And then I realized, they were stronger than we.  Because they could stand it.  These were not monsters.  These were men, strained cadres.  These men who fought with their hearts, who have families, who have children, who are filled with love...that they had the strength, the strength to do that.  If I had ten divisions of those men, then our troubles here would be over very quickly. You have to have men who are moral, and at the same time, who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling, without passion.  Without judgment. Without Judgment.  Because it's judgment  that defeats us.
I worry that my son might not understand what I've tried to be. And if I were to be killed, Willard, I would want someone to go to my home and tell my son everything...
Everything I did.  Everything you saw.  Because there's nothing I detest more than the stench of lies.  And if you understand me, Willard, you will do this for me.
PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty standing by, over.  PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty standing by.  How do you copy?
They were gonna make me a major for this, and I wasn't even in their fucking army anymore. Everybody wanted me to do it.  Him most of all.  I felt like he was up there, waiting for me to take his pain away.  He just wanted to go out like a soldier.
Standing up.  Not even like some poor, wasted rag-assed renegade. Even the jungle wanted him dead. And that's who he really who he took his orders from, anyway.
We train young men to drop fire on people, but their commanders won't allow them to write "fuck" on their airplanes because it's obscene.
The horror....the horror.
Calling PBR Street Gang.  PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.  Do you read me?  Over.  PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty.
The horror...the horror.
