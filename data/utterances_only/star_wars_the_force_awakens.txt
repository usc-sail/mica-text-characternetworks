Well, because of you now we have a chance. The General's been after this for a long time.
BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San Tekka.
We've got company.
You have to hide.
Come on, BB-8! Hurry! Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES
I see 'em! BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster! The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS! Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER. Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL. They're in trouble.
You take this. It's safer with you than it is with me. You get as far away from here as you can. Do you hear me?  I'll come back for you! It will be alright.
Stay here. Our Trooper nods. Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE.
Look how old you've become.
You know what I've come for.
The map to Skywalker. We know you've found it, and now you're going to give it to the First Order. Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San Tekka exchange continue.
I'll show you the dark side.
You're so right. And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA! Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES AT KYLO REN! Instantly: Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLT
So who talks first? You talk first?
The old man gave it to you.
It's just very hard to understand you with all the...
... Apparatus. The Troopers roughly pull Poe away. A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer. Poe just glares as the pat down ends.
Nothing, sir.
Put him on board. Kylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up Villagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACK-
Sir, the villagers.
Kill them all. Phasma nods, steps forward:
On my command! The Troopers, including OURS, aim at the Villagers.
Fire! Poe is roughly PULLED into a transport ship, the ramp LIFTS. All around our Trooper BLASTERFIRE ERUPTS -- but we're WIDE ENOUGH to see he ISN'T FIRING. PUSH IN until the FIRING STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH -- except ours. Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. But then he STOPS. Feels something. TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows he's doomed. Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which, after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE, scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper.
Nothing here. Go ahead! Three other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing -- destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION.
In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and frightened.
All right. All right! Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast:
FN-2187. Submit your blaster for inspection.
Yes, Captain.
And who gave you permission to remove that helmet?
I'm sorry, Captain.
Report to my division at once.
Phasma heads off. Shattered, FN-2187 replaces his helmet.
CRASH! Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the sand. Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from her speeder toward the town.
Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small, passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another language. She returns to work.
What you've brought me today is worth... Hmmm... One quarter portion. Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks. Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET: DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another. She takes it. She swallows her resentment and heads off.
Tal'ama parqual! The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.
Parqual zatana! A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening. BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching a tennis match. Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch. Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and says, fiercely:
The Teedo barks a sort of "AHHHHH!" (As if to say, "GO TO HELL!"), Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively.
Shhhh. BB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off. Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him.
That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts. He has no respect for anyone. Your antenna's bent. (considers BB-8 for the first time,
Where do you come from?
Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north, you'll drown in the sand. 
Don't follow me. Town is that way.  No! She heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else. This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, "Come on." BB-8 quickly moves to her. They head off together.
In the morning, you go.
I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. Comfortable? Through battered lips:
Not really.
I'm impressed. No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map.
Might wanna rethink your technique. Kylo Ren says nothing, reaches out to him. Poe flinches in the chair as Kylo Ren reaches for his face, not touching him. Poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence --
Where is it?
The Resistance will not be intimidated by you.
Where... is it? Poe can't take it -- he BEGINS TO SCREAM and we CUT TO:
It's in a droid. A BB unit.
Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it.
I leave that to you.
Don't give up. He still might show up. Whoever it is you're waiting for. Classified. I know all about waiting. BB-8 BEEPTALKS a question.
For my family. They'll be back. One day. Come on. She tries to force a smile, but can't, really. She heads off. BB-8 BEEPS... then heads after her.
These five pieces are worth... Let me see here... One half portion.
What about the droid?
What about him?
I'll pay for him. BB-8 doesn't like this at all. Rey is awkward, but curious.
Sixty portions. CLOSE ON HER. Stunned. Literally hungry for this amount of food, her stomach practically rumbles. BB-8 sees her interest and BEEPS furiously, not liking this conversation at all. She looks at Unkar. Looks down at BB-8. Considers it all. Finally, she hears herself say:
Actually... the droid's not for sale.
Follow the girl and get that droid. He SLAMS the service window door SHUT.
Ren wants the prisoner. TIGHT ON POE, in pain, drained, as the Guard unshackles him.
Turn here. Poe turns into a narrow passageway --
Listen carefully: you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here.
This is a rescue, I'm helping you escape. Can you fly a TIE fighter?
You with the Resistance--?!
What?
I can fly anything. Why, why are you helping me?
Because it's the right thing to do.
 You need a pilot.
I need a pilot. And Poe, seeing this is for real, smiles a hero's smile.
We're gonna do this.
 ... Yeah?
Okay, stay calm, stay calm.
I am calm.
I'm talking to myself.
I always wanted to fly one of these things. Can ya shoot?
Blasters, I can!
Okay, same principal! Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons, and mag pulse -- use the site on the right to aim, triggers to fire!
This is very complicated FWOOOOOOM! The TIE FIGHTER LURCHES FORWARD --
I can fix this.
I got it!
Woooahhh! This thing really moves. All right, we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far!
All right!
I'm gonna get us in position, just stay sharp!
Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it? I've got us dead centered. It's a clean shot.
Okay, got it. FN-2187 gets a target, FIRES!
YES! You see that?! DID YOU SEE
I saw it! Hey, what's your name?
Poe reacts, this tells him volumes about FN-2187's history.
FN-whaa?
That's the only name they ever gave me!
Well I ain't using it! FN, huh? Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn! That all right? Even in the madness, Finn can't suppress his smile.
"Finn." Yeah, "Finn", I like that! I like that!
I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.
Good to meet you, Poe!
Good to meet you too, Finn!
Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers--
Use the ventral cannons.
Yes, sir. Bringing them online --
General Hux. Is it the Resistance pilot? Hux turns: Kylo Ren enters fast, looms large, angry.
Yes, and he had help.
We're checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was.
... The one from the village. FN-
Hux is unnerved that Ren knows -- he chalks it up to Ren's Force ability. Kylo Ren heads off.
Sir. Ventral cannons hot.
Fire.
One's coming towards you. My right, your left. Do you see it?
Hold on! I see it!
Nice shot. Finn looks up suddenly in alarm --
Where are you going?
We're going back to Jakku. That's where.
No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system! NEAR-MISS LASER BLASTS as Poe pilots aggressively.
I got to get to my droid before the First Order does!
What - a droid?!
That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange and white: one of a kind.
I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important!
This one is, pal.
We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can! We go back to Jakku, we die!
That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker!
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!!! I-- Suddenly BAM! THEY ARE HIT!
FN-2187 reported to my division, was evaluated and sent to Reconditioning.
No prior signs of non-conformity?
This was his first offense. A technician checks her readings, reports to General Hux.
General. They've been hit.
Destroyed?
They were going back for the droid -- send a squad to the wreckage.
Poe! Poe! Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER, SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. He thinks he sees POE'S ARM -- he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET. He throws that off and tries to find a way in -- even a way to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible.
Poe!!! POE! Suddenly the ship BEGINS TO SINK -- like it's being CONSUMED INTO QUICKSAND -- Finn is slipping in too --
It becomes clear fast: if Finn doesn't get away, he's gonna get sucked in too! So Finn scampers away from the TIE FIGHTER as it SINKS INTO THE SAND! We're in the Sinking Fields. A few moments and IT'S GONE. Finn's out of breath. Horrified. Then A GIANT EXPLOSION ERUPTS FROM below, SENDING SAND AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE! Finn sees this, disoriented, scared, exhausted and defeated. And all alone.
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it if we must.
How capable are your soldiers, General?
They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army.
Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. Unharmed.
Careful, Ren. That your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke.
I want that map. For your sake, I suggest you get it. Ren heads off. Hux hates him.
Water... water... water.. He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like creature  DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.
-- Awgh, GAH! But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE. ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically
Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. One clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. BB-8 reacts nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8 while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS OVER METAL URNS for sale -- Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. He falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING. He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted -- but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard. Finn just watches, stunned. Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM. Finn cannot believe his eyes. IT'S POE'S DROID! Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and... SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. Then something insane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN.
Who? Him? Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant. Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT HIM, quarterstaff in hand. Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF! Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She holds the staff on him threateningly:
What's your hurry, thief?
What--?! Thief? BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES
OW! HEY! What?!
The jacket! This droid says you stole it!
I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!! (BB-8 has ZAPPED him
Where'd you get it? It belongs to his master. Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard decision: to tell the truth.
It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right? Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more.
He was captured... by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed.
Look, I tried to help him. I'm sorry... BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8, then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed:
So you're with the Resistance?
Finn's mind races again. He makes an easy decision: to lie.
Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with the Resistance, yeah.
I've never met a Resistance fighter before.
Well, this is what we look like. Some of us. Others look different.
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base.
Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone's after it. She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:
Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth. Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees.
What is it? Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY! Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents:
 What are you doing?!
Come on! Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT, SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run!
Come on, BB-8!
Let go of me!
No, we gotta move!
 I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way! Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing them! They disappear through a tent. TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET.
Call in the air strike! REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent:
They're shooting at both of us!
Yeah, they saw you with me! You're marked!
Well, thanks for that!
I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?!
Stop taking my hand!
Hey! As Finn comes to, he sees her. Through his fog:
-- Are you okay? And that very question touches her -- having never in her life been asked it.
Yeah.  Follow me. Grateful, Finn takes it. They're off. LOCALS run amok as TIE fighters DIVE BOMB. REY, Finn and BB-
We can't outrun them! Rey POINTS to a parked, four-engine SHIP ahead:
We might in that quad-jumper!
We need a pilot!
We've got one!
You?! (then, indicates one
What about that ship?
That one's garbage! They run for the JUMPER but the passing TIE FIGHTERS FIRE AT IT, BLOWING IT APART IN A HUGE FLAME BALL! Rey, coming to a quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA:
The garbage'll do! She turns and runs back -- Finn and BB-8 follow as they all run toward the piece of junk -- and we see it for the first time: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON! TIE fighters BANK AROUND AGAIN. Finn, Rey and BB-8 run up the ramp of the semi-tarped Falcon.
Gunner position's down there!
No! This ship hasn't been flown in years!
Great.  Whoa! I can do this, I can do this--
I can do this, I can do this-- Rey pulls the yoke:
Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay low!
Stay low! It confuses their tracking! For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to the co-pilot controls -- THE FALCON CANTS!
BB-8, hold on! Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke, stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move.
What are you doing back there? Are you ever gonna fire back?!
I'm working on it! Are the shields up? Rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat.
Not so easy without a co-pilot! Finn struggles with the gun controls and SWEEPING CHAIR:
Try sitting in this thing! Finn finally FIRES BACK at the two TIE FIGHTERS!
We need cover, quick!
We're about to get some!
Finn continues to fire at the TIE fighters, narrowly missing them.
Damn it! Rey maneuvers the ship deeper into the graveyard.
Come on... come on... -- HITS AND SHATTERS the TIE FIGHTER!
Nice shot!
I'm getting pretty good at this!
The cannon's stuck in forward position, I can't move it! You gotta lose 'em!
Get ready!
Okay! For what?
Oh no! Just as the TIE PILOT GETS A LOCK, Rey YANKS THE YOKE --
REY GUNS THE ENGINES again, FLIPS THE FALCON and FLIES AWAY as the TIE FIGHTER CRASHES!
Whooo! The Falcon ROARS OFF, victorious, leaving the ship graveyard and disappearing into the clouds.
FINN Good shooting! Thanks! I-- Now that was some I don't know! -- I've flying! How did you flown some ships but I've do that?! No one never left the planet! trained you? No one? Your last shot was dead That was amazing! on. You got him with one blast! You set me up for it! It was perfect! That was pretty good. They're just staring at each other now, seeing something odd and weird and wonderful -- two people totally inexperienced in joy and camaraderie. Bb-8 BEEPS something urgent -- she turns to the droid, kneels.
You're ok. He's with the Resistance. He's going to get you home. We both will.
Finn. What's yours.
I'm Rey. BB-8 looks at him: really? Finn is reminded: HE'S LIED TO HER. She looks at Finn with a sweet smile.
Rey... But before Finn can say anything they JUMP: across the lounge, STEAM BURSTS from under the grating.
Help me with this! Quick! They hurry to the grating, PULL IT UP together. BB-8 rolls over, watches.
Whoa! What's going on? She goes below as BB-8 BEEPS concern.
Sir. We were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing.
It escaped capture aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter.
The droid... stole a freighter?
Not exactly, sir. It had help. Ren says nothing. Which says everything. Mitaka sweats.
We have no confirmation, but we believe FN-2187 may have been helped in the escape-- Ren IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER, TURNS AND SLASHES AT THE CONSOLE BEHIND HIM! HOLD ON Mitaka, who reacts, looks away -- winces. The horrible SOUNDS of Ren's rage continues. Finally Mitaka looks up. The metallic wall behind Ren is RIPPED with glowing scars.
Anything else? Mitaka hates to say the following, but:
The two were accompanied by a girl. Ren reaches out -- Mitaka is suddenly, violently PULLED TOWARD REN, into his black glove:
What girl?
It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench -- check in there! As he checks a storage box, she disappears down below, overwhelmed by the technical issues --
How bad is it?!
If we wanna live, not good! BB-8 watches as Finn searches A SELECTION OF TOOLS:
They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system! Rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench.
BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is "need to know" -- if I'm taking you there, I need to know!
 This? She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8 alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently:
You gotta tell us where the base is.
Pilex driver, hurry! Finn moves for the tool.
So where's your base?
 Go on BB-8, tell her.
The Ileenium system? Finn hands her the tool, surprised but thrilled -- Rey disappears below again.
Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can. A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it.
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. I need the bonding tape, hurry!
 What about you?
I gotta get back to Jakku!
 BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! !
No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas! Bb-8 has moved to Finn -- TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool. He throws her the tape, she disappears below:
This?
Yes!
Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend? The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed:
None of your business, THAT'S WHY! But then: ALL THE SHIP POWER GOES OUT. BB-8 is nervous.
... That can't be good.
Someone's locked onto us -- all controls are overridden. Finn quickly, awkwardly climbs up, looks out.
Get off. Get off! See anything?
... Oh no.
It's the First Order.
What do we do-- there must be
Finn's mind races -- then:
You said poisonous gas --
-- Yeah, but I fixed that --
Can you unfix it? Rey stares at him -- and gets his plan! They head off --
Finn and Rey, gas masks on, quickly climb into the open grating area.
C'mon BB-8. They help BB-8 down, too: they both struggle like crazy, he weighs a TON.
I got it.
Oooh...
I'm okay. BB-8 get off me...
You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers?
Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins. LIGHTS COME ON! SOUND of the SHIP RAMP LOWERING! Finn PULLS THE GRATING CLOSED as he says:
Hurry!
I'm hurrying! Suddenly the FALCON DOOR OPENS -- AND HAN SOLO AND CHEWBACCA BOARD THE FALCON, weapons at the ready. PUSH IN ON THEM, ready for combat, operating silently, with hand signals only.
Chewie, we're home. Han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. Chewie heads off one way, Han in another. The grating above LIFTS OFF -- hands in surrender, they look up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening. They're SCARED.
Where are the others? Where's the pilot?
...I'm the pilot...
You? Chewie MOAN-TALKS. Rey responds to him --
No, it's true: we're the only ones on board.
You can understand that thing?
And "that thing" can understand you too, so watch it. Come on outta there. They climb up -- BB-8 uses his magnetic arm to quickly pull himself out.
Where'd you get this ship?
Niima Outpost.
Jakku?! That junkyard?
Thank you! Junkyard!
I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain.
Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good. Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. Doesn't see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles. Chewie responds as Han heads toward the cockpit.
This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo?
I used to be.
Han Solo? The Rebellion General?
No, the smuggler!
This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs...!
Twelve! Fourteen. A moment of private joy. Then he sees something that ANNOYS
Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line! Han moves to the corridor.
Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, puts too much stress on
Wait! No -- we need your help!
My help?
This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible!
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker. Yup: Han stops in his tracks.
You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him. The mention of Luke has really hit Han. He turns to Finn.
Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke. Suddenly: a distant, METALLIC KA-CHUNK!
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten
Han hurries out -- they all follow, (Chewie, Rey, Finn, then BB-8), Finn with WILD CONCERN:
Wait -- a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey!
You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you?
I'm hauling Rathtars. On the CONTROL PANEL: IMAGES ON SCREENS FROM ALL AROUND THE SHIP. Including the EXTERIOR, where a TRANSPORT SHIP is LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER. Han is fearful.
Oh great. It's the Guavian Death Gang -- they must've tracked us from Nantoon. Han heads off as:
What's a Rathtar?
They're big and dangerous...
Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?!
No.
Good. They turn a corner:
I got three of 'em going to King Prana.
THREE?! How'd you get them on board?
I used to have a bigger crew. Chewie GROAN-TALKS, concurring.
Get below deck and stay there until I say so -- don't even think about taking the Falcon.
What about BB-8?
He stays with me -- until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way.
What about the Rathtars... where are you keeping them? A TERRIFYING BAM: a GROTESQUE RATHTAR GIANT TONGUE SLAMS into the CARGO CONTAINER window behind Finn, whose heart stops.
There's one.
What are you gonna do?
Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it.
Han Solo. You are a dead man. Han smiles innocently, friendly. BB-8 nervously looks back and forth at the gang, and Han.
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?
The problem is we loaned you fifty thousand for this job.
Can you see them?
No. They start crawling down the crawl space.
I heard you also borrowed fifty thousand from Kanjiklub.
You know you can't trust those little freaks! How long've we known each other? Rey and Finn arrive under the gang. They WHISPER:
They have blasters...
A lot of 'em. We RISE THROUGH THE FLOOR to see the GANG and Han and company in the distance.
The question is how much longer will we know each other? Not long. We want our money back now.
Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money.
Kanjiklub wants their investment back, too.
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!
Tell that to Kanjiklub. The SOUND of a PORTAL OPENING. Han's face GOES WHITE as he turns to the OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR, where KANJIKLUB MEMBERS APPEAR. A GANG in a MEDIEVAL BANDITO style. Han smiles uncomfortably at the Kanjiklub members. Its LEADER, TASU LEECH, out front. Han tries to play it off:
Tasu Leech. Good to see you. Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE:
Wrong again, Solo. It's over for you. Tasu COCKS HIS WEAPON, there for blood. BB-8 is nervous. Finn and Rey react to the sounds of the new gang -- start CRAWLING BACK the other way to see them.
Boys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever not delivered for you before?
Yeah.
Twice! Han realizes he's right.
What was the second time?
Your game is old. There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle.
Nowhere left for you to hide.
That BB unit... the First Order is looking for one just like it. And two fugitives. Finn and Rey SUDDENLY STOP CRAWLING, tense. BB-8 hides behind Han's leg. PUSH IN ON Han as he realizes: Finn and Rey are in real trouble.
First I've heard of it. Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid. Above, another Kanjiklubber :
Search the freighter. One of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor, AIMING A FLASHLIGHT DOWN BELOW, searching for: FINN AND REY, in a QUIET PANIC BELOW: THEY START CRAWLING FAST in the opposite direction they came. Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. They quickly arrive at a JUNCTION BOX AREA, Rey looking at the controls.
Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs!
Close the blast doors from here?
Resetting the fuses should do it. Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as they do. Finn quickly joins in. Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too. DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS --
... I got a bad feeling about this... Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below, where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned.
Oh no.
Oh no, what?
Kill them! And take the droid! The gangs AIM THEIR WEAPONS JUST AS A RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND
This was a mistake!
Huge!
What do they look like?
Another corner -- and GANG MEMBERS ARE BATTLING A HORRIBLE RATHTAR! Rey COVERS HER MOUTH.
They look like that. Finn yanks her away. They race around another corner -- a
This way!
Are you sure? They scream and run off -- but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAY
But the Rathtar's fast and TURNS A CORNER, losing Rey --
Without Finn, she is instantly distraught -- then she realizes: SHE'S JUST PASSED A CONTROL PANEL! Her eyes light up as she moves to it: a BANK OF VIDEO MONITORS OF THE SHIP -- and there's Finn, being dragged by a Rathtar toward an OPEN BLAST DOOR. Rey's hand on the button, she waits... then
Finn!
It had me! But the door--!
That was lucky! ANOTHER CORRIDOR - Finn and Rey run towards the Falcon.
I got the door. Cover us! Chewie GROAN-AGREES. Chewie FIRES DOWN THE HALL as Han CROSSES THE CORRIDOR, BB-8 following nervously. As Chewie exchanges blaster fire, Han works the controls. THE HATCH OPENS  -- just as CHEWIE IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER BY ENEMY FIRE! He goes down with a
Chewie! You okay? Han GRABS CHEWIE'S BOWCASTER, FIRES at the DOOR CONTROLS,
 Wow. Come on! Come on!
Han! Finn and Rey race past BB-8 -- as they go up the ramp, Han says to Rey:
You, close the door behind us!
Hey, where are you going?
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too -- if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere.
I hate that guy. Han sits as, Rey hitting buttons:
And you could use a co-pilot.
I got one, he's back there.
Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of here at lightspeed --
I never ask that question until after I've done it. A RATHTAR JUMPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD -- REY SCREAMS! Its GIANT MOUTH CHEWING AT THE GLASS! Han works the controls:
This is not how I thought this day was gonna go -- angle the shields -- Hang on back there! IN THE LOUNGE, Chewie is in pain -- Finn going through a first aid kit -- the ship is HIT again --
Come on baby, don't let me down! He hits a switch -- but NOTHING.
What?! But Rey reaches over, hits a switch, matter-of-factly.
Compressor. Han doesn't like it but she's right -- he hits the switch again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO:
Inform the First Order that Han Solo has the droid they want. And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon.
The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance...
... Leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise.
Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility for th--
General! Our strategy must now change.
The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic. Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker. Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then:
Go. Oversee preparations.
Yes, Supreme Leader. General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him go. Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice.
There's been an awakening. Have you felt it?
Yes.
There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. In the hands of your father, Han Solo. Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise.
He means nothing to me.
Even you, master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test.
We shall see. We shall see. A gentle, satisfied nod from Snoke, and Kylo Ren, obsessed, filled up, exits. Snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque evil SMILE growing -- as he DISINTEGRATES -- Snoke has been a HOLOGRAM all along.
Electrical overload!
I can fix that!
The coolant's leaking!
Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank--
-- Secondary tank, I got it!
Chewie, come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! Stop moving! Chewie!
You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me!
Hurt him?! He almost killed me six times! (Chewie GRABS HIM by the collar, ROARS) Which is fine.
This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems. Han at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied, sits in the co-pilot seat. Han is confused.
What'd you do?
I by-passed the compressor. He looks at her. A little, appreciative laugh. Han exits, walking past BB-8.
Move, Ball.
Nah, don't say that, you did great. Just rest. Han turns to Finn, who sits at the HOLOCHESS set, BB-8 beside him. This is awkward for Han, but damn, he means it:
Good job, kid. And thanks.
You're welcome. Finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. The pieces start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to turn it off.
So, fugitives, huh?
The First Order wants the map.
 Finn is with the Resistance...
Let's see whatcha got.
This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him.
Why'd he leave?
He was training a new generation of Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible... He walked away from everything.
Do you know what happened to him?
There're a lot of rumors. Stories. The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple.
The Jedi were real?
I used to wonder that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo -- magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light.
An alarm rings on the control station, prompting Han to toggle some switches. BB-8 cuts off the hologram. Chewie rises and moans to Han, but Han motions for Chewie to lay back
No, you rest.  You want my help? You're getting it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home. This is our stop. Han leaves towards the cockpit, Rey and Finn following.
Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here --
D'you just call me "Solo"?
Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order sympathizers?
Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Hands him a BLASTER.
Always. Han walks off. Finn watches him go, wracked with guilt.
You might need this.
I think I can handle myself.
I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. Rey picks it up. Grips it.
You know how to use one of these?
Yeah, you pull the trigger.
There's a little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name?
Rey.
Rey. I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon.
Are you offering me a job?
I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much.
You're offering me a job.
I'm thinking about it. Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she can't cross.
Well?
If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home. Han looks at her, questioningly.
Jakku? Rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku.
It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you. Han heads off. HOLD on Rey.
Solo, why are we here again?
To get your droid on a clean ship.
Clean?
Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet.
We can trust her, right?
Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare...
Any of it. The door opens. Music. Madness. And...
Han Solo! Everyone turns to look. It's ALL QUIET in here.
 Hey, Maz! NOISE returns. Maz walks to them, pushes someone away.
Where's my boyfriend?
Chewie's working on the Falcon.
I like that Wookiee. I assume you need something. Desperately. Let's get to it.
Maz walks off, gesturing for them to follow. Finn and Rey are confused. Han indicates for them to follow. They do -- passing the enormous GRUMMGAR, who sits with vixen BAZINE NETAL, who watches them suspiciously. A SMALL DROID , who turns its head to see BB-8 following Rey across the room. GA-97, now animated, makes a small TRANSMITTING SOUND, which is subtitled.
Alert the Resistance. Their missing droid is here! And we CUT TO:
Inform the First Order... I've found the droid.
Forgive me. I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me, Grandfather, and I will finish what you started. As his emotion builds, he stands and heads off -- we FOLLOW HIM, PIVOTING TO REVEAL who he was talking to: THE BURNT,
A map to Skywalker himself? You're right back in the mess.
Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.
Hmm. No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. Han, nyakee nago wadda. Go home!
Leia doesn't want to see me.
Please, we came here for your help.
What fight?
The only fight: against the dark side. Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today, it is the First Order. Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us.
There is no fight against the First Order! Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right-- Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing him -- her eyes get HUGE.
What's this? What are you doing? Maz adjusts the goggles again. Her eyes get impossibly BIGGER. She grunts recognition. She hoists herself on the tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards Finn.
Solo, what is she doing?
I don't know, but it ain't good.
If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people. I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run.
 You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen.
You don't know the First Order like I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run. Rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her chair. She points to some pirates in the corner.
You see those two? They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. There, you can disappear. Finn sees them. Considers.
Finn!
Come with me.
What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base.
I can't. Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han.
Keep it, kid. Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses back to normal, and turns to Han.
Who's the girl?
Who has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS.
I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim. Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting.
What are you doing? Finn gets up to talk to her.
 Don't leave without me.
Embarrassed, Finn moves her away.
You can't just go. I won't let you.
I'm not who you think I am.
Finn, what are you talking about?
I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper.
Right into you. And you looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me.
Don't go.
Take care of yourself. Please. Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey watches Finn return to the aliens... And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks through it. Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked back at her one last time.
Hesitant, Rey enters.
She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY. We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS. She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT NIGHT. We PAN to: R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE, whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND. We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT -- and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP -- To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him! Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see... A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical. Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku, watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her.
No, come back!
Quiet, girl! The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around her to see she is.. In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind, confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound. Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN:
What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there.
That lightsaber was Luke's. And his father's before him and now, it calls to you! Rey stands, fast. Still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless.
I have to get back to Jakku.
Han told me. (reaches out, hold
Dear child. I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku, they're never coming back. But... there's someone who still could.
Luke.
The belonging you seek is not behind you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi, but I know the Force. It moves through and surrounds every living thing. Close your eyes. Feel it.
The light. It's always been there. It will guide you. The saber. Take it. Rey suddenly stands.
I'm never touching that again. I don't want any part of this. And Rey runs off, passing Maz. Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl.
Today is the end of the Republic! The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! At this very moment, in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand, will bring an end to the Senate! To their cherished fleet! All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! And will remember this... as the last day of the Republic!
And Hux TURNS to give the signal as we CUT BACK WIDE -- a ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!
It was the Republic. Han and Chewie turn as Finn arrives, moving quickly through the crowd. With dread:
The First Order, they've done it. Where's Rey?
What are you doing?
BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to go back, you're too important. They'll help you. Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER
I've had this for ages...
Kept it locked away.
Where'd you get that?
A good question for another time.
Those beasts! They're here!
FN-417, hold position! Rey takes cover, grabs her BLASTER -- but IT WON'T FIRE! She panics, then realizes:
Safety! SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS and retreats, calls to BB-8: BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more chasing Troopers!
Sir, the droid was spotted heading west, with a girl. Kylo Ren LOOKS BACK SHARPLY, in Rey's direction --
You have to keep going, stay out of sight, I'll try to fight 'em off. (BB-8 BEEPS; bravely through her fear) I hope so, too. BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE --
Come on, Chewie! Maz turns to Finn:
Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now go.
I need a weapon. Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER.
You have one! He looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the lightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON. HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at Stormtroopers, taking some out!
Hey, can I try that? Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers and sends them flying.
Traitor! FINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. The Mace Trooper KNOCKS FINN DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him, when THE STORMTROOPER IS SHOT AND FALLS! Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast! Han helps him up.
You okay, Big deal?
Thanks! But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED.
Don't move! TK-338, we have targets in custody!
No way out, they DROP THEIR WEAPONS: TIGHT on the LIGHTSABER as it HITS THE GROUND. A STORMTROOPER HAND picks it up. Han's MIND RACES as a SQUAD OF TROOPERS appears behind them. Finn, Han and Chewie are MARCHED by Stormtroopers back toward a transport, hands on their heads. But then -- A FAMILIAR ROAR RIPPING ACROSS THE LAKE -- Han turns -- they all do: coming toward them across the water, X-
We have incoming at two-eight-point- six! Move! Dispatch! Move! Scramble all squads! Repeat, scramble all squads! Anti-air cover en route to our position!
It's the Resistance. One X-WING in particular -- MARKED IN BLACK -- SWOOPS DOWN and takes out the parked TIE FIGHTERS and Troopers!
Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you!
Copy that!
We're with you, Poe! The Stormtroopers around Finn, Han and Chewie SCATTER, TOSSED in EXPLOSIONS! The LIGHTSABER LANDS AGAIN -- FINN PICKS IT
Quick! Chewie picks up his Bowcaster, Han takes the blaster. Shoots a Trooper.
Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva pilot!
The girl I've heard so much about. He walks AROUND HER, slowly, she won't let herself cry.
The droid. He comes around to see her face. After a scary beat he WHIPS
Where is it?
Request air support!
The map. You've seen it. Rey is horrified. He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears stream. Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind... She stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony -- Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE EXPLOSIONS. Stormtroopers APPROACH through the woods.
Sir, Resistance fighters! We need more troops. Kylo Ren TURNS BACK TO Rey, his hand still on her face.
Pull the division out. Forget the droid. We have what we need. A GESTURE from Kylo Ren and REY LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS, FALLS
Pull back the tree line! Han and Chewie dodge debris, FIRING and TAKING OUT TROOPERS. FINN takes out 2 TROOPERS with the blaster, then, out of breath, turns to see: Kylo Ren in the forest, CARRYING REY IN HIS ARMS, INTO HIS SHUTTLE! Finn's heart SHATTERS -- Han stops -- turns -- sees Kylo Ren entering his shuttle. Han is ROCKED.
Heroically, Finn runs toward the shuttle through LASER BLASTS AND EXPLOSIONS, but the shuttle TAKES OFF -- Finn irrationally
No, no, no, no... REY!! In crazed frustration, Finn stops running, watches the receding First Order ships, Rey their captive.
He took her! Did you see that? He took her. She's gone!
Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See- Threepio!  You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm. (sees Leia,
Look who it is! Did you see who? Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General. Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly.
You changed your hair.
Same jacket.
No, new jacket. Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship. It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly:
... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here. Leia hears this. Maz watches through the smoke.
This is D'QAR.
Then BB-8 SPEEDS RIGHT PAST HIM, almost knocking him down -- Finn watches as BB-8 rolls over to the PILOT GETTING OUT OF THE BLACK-MARKED X-WING. The Pilot's helmet comes off.
Poe. Poe Dameron. They move to each other -- and embrace.
You're alive!
So are you!
What happened to you?
What happened? I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing-- BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe listens, turns to Finn.
BB-8 says that you saved him.
No, no, no. It wasn't just me.
You completed my mission, Finn. That's my jacket?
Oh here.
No, no, no. Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man, Finn.
Poe -- I need your help.
General Organa. Sorry to interrupt, this is Finn, he needs to talk to
 And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave, what you did. Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life --
 Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner--
Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry. Finn is startled -- Poe jumps in:
Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. He worked on the base.
We're desperate for anything you can tell us.
That's where my friend was taken -- I've got to get there, fast.
And I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know.
General, I regret to inform you, but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. And even worse, it matches no charted system on record. We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke.
I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home.
Leia...
Don't do that.
Do what? She heads off.
Anything. Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO.
Princesses. Han follows Leia across the base floor:
I'm trying to be helpful!
When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star.
BB-8. You're wasting your time. BB-8 looks up at C-3PO, who stands there. C-3PO SIGHS.
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data.
Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him.
You think I want to forget him? I want him back! Han looks at her with sympathy.
There was nothing we could've done.  There was too much Vader in him.
That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both.
We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever good at.
We both did.
We lost our son, forever.
No.
He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You.
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could
Luke is a Jedi... you're his father. There's still light in him. I know it.
General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming.
Where am I?
Where are the others?
You mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends?  You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea.
Rey studies him. She's fearful... but curious.
You still want to kill me.
That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask. Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment before she regains her own mask of defiance.
Tell me about the droid.
 He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --
He's carrying a section of a navigational chart. We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. We need the last piece. And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger -- Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know?
You know I can take whatever I want. Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer, his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE... THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER. And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move, quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing.
... You're so lonely... so afraid to leave...  At night, desperate to sleep... you imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see the island... Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to break free, but can't budge.
And Han Solo. You feel like he's the father you never had. He would've disappointed you.
His hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony:
-- Get out of my head -- But this just makes Kylo lean closer.
I know you've seen the map. It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too. Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but:
I'm not giving you anything.
We'll see. He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze --
... You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... Darth Vader! KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on Kylo Ren, who starts to leave. And we PRELAP:
This scavenger, resisted you?
She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows. And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke:
And the droid?
Kylo Ren hesitates to reveal the truth. Then:
Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us. Ren turns back -- Hux enters the large space, moves to the platform beside Ren.
That the girl was all we needed. As a result, the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. They may have the map already. Snoke is visibly furious.
Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker.
We have their location. We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system.
Good. Then we will crush them once and for all. Prepare the weapon. Kylo Ren is stunned by the moment -- that isn't what he meant at all --
Supreme Leader. I can get the map from the girl. I just need your guidance.
If what you say about this girl is true, bring her to me.
You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. A beat.
You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open. The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER. Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or laughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says:
You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open.
And you will drop your weapon.
Enraged, he RIPS OUT HIS SABER and --
Begin charging the weapon!
Yes, sir. Weapon charging.
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report.
They've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself.
A laser cannon?
We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale.
I wish that were the case, Major. Poe hits a control. A WIREFRAME OF THE DEATH STAR APPEARS.
This was the Death Star. Poe hits another control -- the Death Star SHRINKS -- AND SHRINKS AND SHRINKS, as the SURFACE AREA OF THE STARKILLER
This is Starkiller Base. This is news to many here, and they're stunned.
So it's big.
How is it possible to power a weapon of this size?
It uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears. An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD.
 The First Order: they're charging the weapon again, now.  Our system is the next target.
Oh my. Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed. They all react to this horrible news.
Okay, how do we blow it up?  There's always a way to do that.
But no one has anything. Leia watches the silence, frustrated. Finally, rallying them:
Han's right. Han is surprised.
 In order for that amount of power to be contained, that base would need some kind of thermal oscillator...
There is one. All eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location on the Starkiller Base -- it is ZOOMED IN: A GIANT BLACK
Precinct 47. Here.
... Maybe the planet. Poe then tries to bolster spirits, looking at the BIG HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE: the Oscillator.
We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got.
They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate.
We disable the shields.
 I can do it.
I like this guy.
I can disable the shields. But I have to be there, on the planet--
We'll get you there.
Han, how?
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.
So we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. All right. Let's go! And everyone splits.
Chewie, check that donal capitator. Come on. Let's go. -- Finn, be careful with those - they're explosives.
Now you tell me?
No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave. Han looks over, there's Leia.
That's what I did it. So you'd miss me. She laughs, moves up close to him.
I did miss you. He looks at her, says sweetly, out of the blue:
It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh? Some of it was...good.
... Pretty good.
Some things never change.
If you see our son again, bring him home.
Sir, sensors triggered in hangar 718. We're searching the area.
She's just beginning to test her powers. The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes. Kylo exits.
How are we getting in?
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through. Finn is suddenly filled with dread.
We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?! Chewie, thinking it's crazy too, says: HELL YES WE ARE!
Alright, Chewie, get ready. Chewie GROANS: he's ready. Han studies the PANEL INDICATORS.
And Now! Chewie and Han hit switches --
I get any higher, they'll see us! And the ship DIVES again, back into the trees!
Sir, she was not found in hangar 718 but all troops are on alert.
Put every hangar on lock-down. She's going to try to steal a ship to-- Suddenly, Kylo senses something. Something familiar.
Han Solo...
The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. We'll get in that way.
What was your job when you were based here?
Sanitation.
Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields?
I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.
People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us--!
Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force!
That's not how the Force works--!
Chewie MOANTALKS.
Oh really, you're cold?
Come on! They follow Finn on the snowy hike. On the horizon, THE
Report.
Hey! He fumbles for his blaster but Chewie shoots first. WIDE ANGLE of the corridor as the Trooper flies back, dead. Chewie drags him out of sight. Han and Finn peer around a corner, wary.
The longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. The shields?
I have an idea about that. Han and Chewie follow Finn.
Remember me?
Not anymore. The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge.
Bring it down. Bring it down.
Follow me. Finn SMILES as we CUT TO:
You want me to blast that bucket off your head? Lower the shields.
You're making a big mistake.
Do it. Chewie MOAN/TALKS. Phasma hits a few more buttons -- the controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLE INITIATE". Eyes on
Solo, if this works, we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey.
Don't worry kid, we won't leave here without her. The controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLED".
 You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy. My troops will storm this block and kill you all.
I disagree. What do we do with her?
Is there a garbage chute? Trash compactor?
Yeah, there is...
General, their shields are down!
Thank the Maker!
Han did it! Send them in!
Give Poe full authorization to attack.
Black Leader, go to sub-lights. On your call.
Roger, base -- red squad, blue squad, take my lead.
Dropping out of lightspeed.
Almost in range! Hit the target dead center, as many runs as we can get!
Approaching target.
Dispatch all squadrons...
Yes, General.
Let's light it up!
Direct hit!
But no damage! Jess reacts.
Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it! Another bombing run! Remember, when that sun is gone, that weapon will be ready to fire! But as long as there's light, we got a chance.
Guys, we got a lot of company!
We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover.
You sure you're up for this?
Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey --  -- The troopers'll be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that'll leads -- (Han starts pointing with his chin to
Why are you doing that? Why are you doing -- this? I'm trying to come up with a plan. Finn turns -- AND SEES REY, CLIMBING OUT FROM INSIDE THE WALL, carefully climbing back up to the main level! He can't believe it! Chewie MURMURS his relief. Han is maybe more grateful than anyone.
The Oscillator's still standing.
X-wings coming back for another round of attacks!
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Good.
What happened -- did he hurt you?
Finn. What are you doing here?!
We came back for you. She is speechless -- this is all she's ever wanted anyone to do. Chewie TALKS -- and Rey's eyes nearly tear up.
What'd he say?
 ... That it was your idea. Finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace.
Thank you.
How did you get away?
I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it.
Escape now. Hug later.
I got one behind me. See it?
Yeah, I'm on it!
A heavy cannon emplacement launches a missile that shreds an X-wing fighter.
Furillo's been hit!
Watch out for ground fire!
They're in trouble. We can't leave.  My friend here has a bag full of explosives. Let's use 'em.
Two more X-wings down. That's half our fleet destroyed.
And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes! It would take a miracle to save us now.
And she YANKS a piece of TECH from the machinery and:
That girl knows her stuff.
We'll set the charges at every other column. He GROAN/TALKS to Han, who looks around, reconsiders.
You're right. That's a better idea.  You take the top.
Find them. They rush past him. Kylo Ren turns slowly, and HEADS DOWN.
Ben! The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast catwalk. He turns.
Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time. Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on the catwalk below.
Take off that mask. You don't need it.
What do you think you'll see if I do? Han moves toward Kylo Ren.
The face of my son. Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face of his son for the first time as a man.
Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish, like his father. So I destroyed him.
That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. My son is alive. SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch.
No. The Supreme Leader is wise. UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene. ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern:
Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true. Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it.
It's too late.
No it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you. For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears flood his stoic eyes...
I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain.
I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me? Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable.
Yes. Anything. Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch
Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon -- but with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH
Thank you. ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM --
Our MUSIC TAKES OVER, EPIC AND HEARTBREAKING as Stormtroopers FIRE AT CHEWIE, who is forced to retreat down a corridor, where he holds the EXPLOSIVE REMOTE -- he PUSHES THE BUTTON! Hearing ONLY OUR SCORE, FIRST ONE, then TWO, then FOUR, then SIX EXPLOSIONS rock the structure -- CATWALKS FALL as the walls CAVE IN! Kylo Ren SEES REY AND FINN, WATCHING THE EXPLOSIONS IN SHOCK -- then they SEE KYLO REN, WHO RECOGNIZES THEM BOTH, WITH ASTONISHMENT. He rises to his full height and heads for them with long strides. Stormtroopers begin to BLAST AWAY AT REY AND FINN! CRAZED,
The Oscillator's been damaged but is still functional. COMMODORE META reacts.
The Falcon's this way. Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both out of breath. They look at each other. They both know: they can't run.
We're not done yet.
You're a monster!
It's just us now. Han Solo can't save you. After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT! Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER -- she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND -- another GESTURE and Rey FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away! She drops -- LANDS HARD in the snow. Dazed, hurt.
Rey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh no no no... Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE.
In reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- upon seeing the weapon, Kylo Ren REACTS IN SHOCK.
That lightsaber. It belongs to me!
Come get it. Despite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. Kylo Ren CHARGES at him - Finn terrified -- Kylo Ren LUNGES but Finn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade! Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS, COUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys this challenge more! Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two men fighting, through the trees. Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN! LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK -- wounded, but more enraged than weakened. Kylo Ren CHARGES AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK, the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers: And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity -- Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness. Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses balance.
That's when KYLO REN STRIKES: HE LANDS A BLOW TO FINN'S TORSO --
We just lost R-1!
We're overwhelmed! What do we do? It isn't working! Another pilot looks down -- SEES THE EXPLOSION -- coming from the OSCILLATOR. Relatively small, it's an opening:
Black Leader, there's a brand new hole in that oscillator. Looks like our friends got in!
Red Four! Red Six! Cover us!
I'm on it!
Roger!
Everybody else, hit the target hard! Give it everything you got! And the X-WINGS DIVE and BLAST the OSCILLATOR --
I need some help here! I need some help!
I'm coming in!
Watch out!
I'm hit! The alien pilot's X-wing is blasted to pieces.
All teams - I'm going in! Pull up and cover me!
Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck, Poe! The trailing X-wings peel off as Poe's black fighter darts into the fiery breach.
Weapon at full capacity in thirty seconds.
Prepare to fire.
You need a teacher! I can show you the ways of the Force!
The Force. Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them, she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER! Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES
Lieutenant, get back to your station!
 Just look. We won't survive -- even Hux has gone! As he hurries off, WE HEAR:
Supreme Leader.
The fuel cells have ruptured. The collapse of the planet has begun. Snoke takes this in. Furious, desolate... knowing.
Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren.
Finn! Finn... Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries, holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores. They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all is lost... Her wet eyes look up to see:
All teams! I got eyes on them!
Yes! The X-wings ROAR OFF, skyward as the MUSIC SOARS, the PLANET IMPLODES -- THE SUNLIGHT IT CONTAINS BURSTS FORTH, and as we get further and further distance from what was Starkiller Base, we witness the REBIRTH OF A SUN. Light restored to a corner of the galaxy. The Millennium Falcon and the X-wings RIP THROUGH SPACE, headed home.
Our job's done here. Let's go home!
Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a heartbeat. Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia. C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering. Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry. The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's face in her hands. Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful. She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace. Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting.
As BB-8 approaches R2-D2, the long dormant droid suddenly stirs. The droids beep at each other.
R2-D2! You've come back! You found what? How dare you call me that!
(he swats R2-D2, who
Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We must go tell the others at once!
General? Excuse me, General? Leia turns to see droids.
R2-D2 may contain some much needed good news.
Tell me. Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of Resistance Officers. Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A
Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on -- Poe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor San Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY --
Everyone REACTS -- amazed --
Oh! The map! It is complete!
 -- Luke -- Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES. C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly:
 Oh my dear friend. How I've missed you.
We'll see each other again. I believe that. Thank you, my friend.
Rey. Rey turns around.
May the Force be with you. This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully. Rey crosses to the Falcon.
And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's only hope.
