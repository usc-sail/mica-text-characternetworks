Onward Chauncey, to the highest room of the tallest tower! Where my princess awaits rescue from her handsome Prince Charming.
This is worse than Love Letters! I hate dinner theatre.
Me too.
Whoa there, Chauncey!
Hark! The brave Prince Charming approach-ith.
Fear not fair maiden! I shall slay the monster that guards you and take my place as rightful King.
 What did she say?
Grrrrrrr!
 Woooo hoooo!!!
Yea! Shrek!
Prepare foul beast to enter into a world of pain with which you are not familiar!
 Happy Birthday to thee.
Do you mind?
Do you mind? Bo-ring! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 3.
 Prepare foul beast-
 Someday you'll be sorry.
 We already are!
Grrrrrrr!
 Oh mommy.
Oh, you're right. I can't let this happen. I can't.
I am the rightful King of Far Far Away and I promise you this mother. I will restore dignity to my throne!
And this time, no one will stand in my way!
Good morning.
Good morning.  Oh... morning breath... Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 5.
 I know. Isn't it wonderful?
 "Good morning! Good morning!"
 "The sun is shining through! Good morning! Good morning. (coming closer and closer TO SHREK) "To you!"  "And you!"  And you!
Oh, they grow up so fast.
Not fast enough.
Okay. You have a very full day filling in for the King and Queen. There are several functions that require your attendance, sir. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 6.
Great! Let's get started.
C'mon, lazy bones, time to get movin'!
Aaahhh! You know you really need to get yourself a pair of jammies.
I knight thee...
He-he. Ooh.
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 7.
Well, since you're filling in for one, you might as well look like a real King. Can somebody come in here and work on Shrek please?
 I will see what I can do.
Ow! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 8.
Oh!
Yeah, wow.
Uh, is this really necessary?
 Ho, ho. Quite necessary, Fiona.
I'm Shrek, you twit.
Whatever.
Okay peoples! This isn't a rehearsal. Let's see some hustle.
Smiles everyone, smiles! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 9.
I don't know how much longer I can keep this up Fiona.
I'm sorry Shrek, but can you please just try to grin and bear it? It's just until Dad gets better.
Shrek?
Yeah.
You look handsome.
Ah. Come here, you.
Oh, my butt is itching up a storm and I can't reach it in this monkey suit!
Oh.  Hey you. Come here!
What's your name? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 10.
Eh, Fiddlesworth, sir.
Hoo hoo hooo. Perfect.
You've done it. Oh, a little over to the left, yeah. That's great.
Uh Shrek?
Ahh! All right, you got it...Oh yeah, you're on it. Oh that's it! Oh that's good!
Shrek...
Oh yeah! Scratch that thing! You got it. You're on it. That's great!
SHREK!
Ow!! My eye! My eye! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 11.
What are you doing?
Fiona!
Uhhh... 
Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.
Ahhhh!
Oh! Shrimp! My favorite. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 12.
That's it! We're leaving!
Honey, please calm down...
Calm down? Who do you think we're kidding? I am an ogre! I'm not cut out for this, Fiona and I never will be.
I think that went pretty well.
Donkey!
Aww, come on now Shrek!
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 13.
Some people just don't understand boundaries.
Just think... a couple more days, and we'll be back home in our vermin-filled shack, strewn with fungus, filled with the rotting stench of mud and neglect.
Oh, you had me at "vermin-filled."
And, uh... maybe even the pitter- patter of little feet on the floor...?
 That's right. The swamp rats will be spawning.
Uh, no... you know, what I was thinking of is a little bit bigger than a swamp rat.
Donkey?
No, Shrek. Um... what if - THEORETICALLY -
Yeah?
They were little ogre feet? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 14.
Oh. 
Honey? Let's try and be rational about this. Have you seen a baby lately? They just eat and poop and they cry and then they cry when they poop and they poop when they cry...Now, imagine an ogre baby. They extra cry and they extra poop.
Shrek.
Don't you ever think about having a family?
Right now, you're my family.
Well, somebody better be dying.
I'm dying.
Harold.
Don't forget to pay the gardener, Lillian.
Of course darling.
Fiona...
Yes Daddy?
I know I've made many mistakes with you.
It's okay.
But your love for Shrek has taught me so much.
My dear boy, I am proud to call you my son.
And I'm proud to call you my Frog... King Dad in-law.
Now, there is a matter of business to attend tooo...
The Frog King is dead. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 16.
 Put your hat back on, fool.
Shrek, please come hither.
Yeah, Dad?
This Kingdom needs a new king. You and Fiona are next in line for the throne.
Ooo. Next in line. Now you see Dad, that's why people love you. Even on your deathbed you're still making jokes.
Oh, come on Dad...an Ogre as King? I don't think that's such a good idea. There's got to be somebody else. Anybody?
Aside from you there is only one remaining heir.
Really!? Who is he, Dad?
His name is... is... is...
What's his name? What's his name?
...is ... Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 17.
Daddy!
 His name is Arthur.
Arthur?
 I know you'll do what's...  riiiight...
Harold!?
Dad? Dad? Dad?
Do your thing, man.
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 18.
What does a Prince have to do to get a drink around here?
Ah Mabel, why they call you an ugly stepsister I'll never know.
Where's Doris, taking the night off? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 20.
She's not welcome here and neither are you.
What do you want, Charming?
Oh not much, just a chance at redemption...  And a Fuzzy Navel.
And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends!
We're not your friends.
Ahh!
You don't belong here.
You're right; oh, I mean you're absolutely right, but I mean, do any of us?
Do a number on his face! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 21.
No, no, wait, wait, wait! We are more alike than you think.
Wicked Witch. The Seven Dwarves saved Snow White and then what happened?
Oh, what's it to you?
They left you the un-fairest of them all. And now here you are, hustling pool to get your next meal. How does that feel?
Pretty unfair.
And you? Your star puppet abandons the show to go and find his father.
I hate that little wooden puppet.
And Hook...
... Need I say more?
And you! Frumpypigskin.
Rumplestiltskin.
Where's that first-born you were promised, hey? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 22.
Mabel, remember how you couldn't get your little fat foot into that tiny glass slipper?
Cinderella is in Far Far Away right now, eating Bon Bons, cavorting with every little last Fairy-tale Creature that has ever done you wrong.
Once upon a time, someone decided that we were the losers. But there are two sides to every story. And our side has not been told.
So who will join me? Who wants to come out on top for once? Who wants their happily ever after?!
It's out of my hands senorita, the winds of fate have blown on my destiny. But I will never forget you. You are the love of my life.
As are you...
And you.
And, uh... hi. I don't know you, but I'd like to. I gotta go.
I know, I know... I don't want to leave you either baby, but you know how Shrek is. The dude's lost without me.
But don't worry. I'll send you airmail kisses everyday!
Alright, be strong babies! Be strong. Now, Coco, Peanut, you listen to Mama, alright? And Bananas, no more roastin' marshmallows on your sister's head. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 24.
Ah, that's my special boy. Oh, come over here, all of you. Give your Daddy a big hug!
Shrek, maybe you should just stay and be King.
Oh, c'mon, there's no way I could ever run a kingdom. That's why your cousin Arthur's the perfect choice.
It's not that. No. It's, you see...
And if he gives me any trouble, I've always got persuasion and reason.  Here's persuasion,  and here's reason.
Fiona, soon it's just gonna be you and me and our swamp.
 It's not going to be just you and me.
All aboard! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 25.
It will be. I promise. I love you.
Awwwwwwwww!
That's lovely.
Bye bye babies!
Shrek!
Yeah?
Wait!
What is it?
I'm, I'm-
 I love you too honey!
No... No, I said I'm pr- Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 26.
You're what?!
I said I'm pregnant!
 Uh... what was that?
You're going to be a father!
 That's great.
Really? I'm glad you think so! I love you.
Yeah...  Me too... you...
I'm gonna be an Uncle. I'm gonna be an Uncle! I'm gonna be an Uncle!
Oh, and you my friend are royally--
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 27.
Ahhh. Home.
Woohoo!
Ahh.
Shrek!?
Ooo. 
Fiona!
Fiona?
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 28.
Huh? Oh no.
 Better out than in, I always say. Ha ha!
Hiccup!
No, no, no, no, no, no. Ha, ha. It's okay. It's gonna be alright.
Da-Da!
Hey! Hey, hey, wait! Would ya? No, no. Stop! Hey, hey, hey. No.
Huh?
Bubabatoo?
Ahhhh! Oh, Donkey! Donkey, wake- up!
 Da-da!
Ahhhh!
Shrek. Shrek, are you okay?
Oh... I can't believe I'm going to be a father.
How did this happen?
Allow me to explain. You see, when a man has certain feelings for a woman, a powerful urge sweeps over him...
I know how it happened. I just can't believe it.
How does it happen?
 And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,  Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 31. DONKEY Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
"When you coming home, son?" "I don't know when, But we'll get together then, Dad-"
Donkey, can you just cut to the part where you're supposed to make me feel better?
You know I love Fiona, Boss. Right?  But what I'm talking about here is you, me, my cousin's boat, an ice- cold pitcher of mojitos, and two weeks of nothing but fishing.
Man, don't you listen to him. Having a baby is not going to ruin your life.
It's not my life I'm worried about ruining. It's the kid's.
I mean...when have you ever heard the phrase "as sweet as an...ogre" or "as nurturing as...an ogre" Or how `bout..."you're gonna' love my dad...he's a real ogre." Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 32.
Okay, okay I get it! Nobody said it was going to be easy. But at least you got us to help you out.
That's true.
I'm doomed.
You'll be fine.
You're finished.
Uh, with your journey.
Wor-ces-ter-shireee. Now that sounds fancy.
It's Worcestershire.
Like the sauce!? Mmmm... It's spicy!
Oohh! They must be expecting us.
What in the shista-shire kind of place is this?
Well, my stomach aches and my palms just got sweaty. Must be a high school.
High school?!
Ready?! Okay! Where for art thou headed, to the top? Yeah we think so, we think so! And dost thou thinkest thine can be stopped? Nay we thinks not! We thinks not!
 For lo bro, don't burn all my frankincense and myrrh. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 34.
I'm already starting to feel nauseous from memories of wedgies and swirlies!
But how did you receive the wedgies when you are clearly not the wearer of the underpants?
Let's just say some things are better left unsaid and leave it at that.
So then I was all like "I'd rather get the black plague and lock myself in an iron maiden than go out with you."
Eh, totally.
Pardon me...
Eh! Totally ew-th!
Yeah, totally!
Yes! I just altered my character level to plus three superbability.
Hi, we're looking for someone named-
Gee, who rolled a plus nine "dork" spell and summoned the beast and his quadrupeds. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 35.
Ha! Ha!  Ah!
I know you're busy "not fitting in" but can either of you tell me where I can find Arthur?
He's over there.
Ha ha! There is no sweeter taste on thy tongue than victory!
Oy! Right! Ooo! Ooo! Ooo!
Strong, handsome, face of a leader. Does Arthur look like a King or what?
Ow.
Oh. Sorry.
Did you just say you were looking for Arthur?
That information is on a need to know basis.
It's top secret, hushity hush.
Now gentlemen let's away... to the showers!
Oy! Right! Ooo! Ooo!
Greetings your majesty. This is your lucky day.
So what for like are you supposed to be? Some kind of giant mutant leprechaun or something?
Oh, ho, ho, ho. Giant mutant leprechaun... You made a funny.
Unhand me, monster!
Stop squirming, Arthur.
I'm not Arthur!
I am Lancelot.
That dork over there is Arthur!
Hey!
Aaah.
Ahem! This is like totally embarrassing, but my friend Tiffany thinkest thou vex her so soothly...
And she thought perchance thou would wanna ask her to the Homecoming Dance or something...
Uh, excuse me?
It's like whatever. She's just totally into college guys and mythical creatures and stuff.
Oh Arthur! Come out, come out wherever you are...
Yeah, you better run, you little punk no good-niks, `cause the days of "Little Donkey Dumpy Drawers" are over!
 We're here for the Mascot Contest too.
 This is a costume?
 Aaaiyyyy... worked on it all night long!
Looks pretty real to me.
If it were real could I do this?
Or this?
 He's right! If it were real that would have been agonizingly painful!
Now watch this.... Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 40.
 That's quite enough boys.
Thank you to Professor Primbottom for his invigorating lecture on how to just say "nay".
And now, without further ado, let's give a warm Worcestershire-hoozah to the winner of our "New Mascot" contest... the--
--ogre?
That's right. I'm the new mascot. So let's really try and beat the other guys... at whatever it is they're doing.
This is indeed all a bit unorthodox.
Now, where can I find Arthur Pendragon? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 41.
Classic.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
I didn't do it. They did.
Please don't eat me.
 Eat him! Eat him!
Eat him! Shrek yanks on Artie and pulls him off the hoop.
I'm not here to eat him.
AWWW.
It's time to pack up your toothbrush and jammies. You're the new King of Far Far Away.
What?
Artie a King? More like the Mayor of Loserville.
Nice one Lance!
Burn.
Is this for real?
Absolutely. Now clean out your locker, kid. You've got a kingdom to run.
So wait, I'm really the only heir?
The one and only.
Give me just a second.
My good people, I think there's a lesson here for all of us. Maybe the next time you're about to dunk a kid's head in a chamber pot, you'll stop and think, hey, maybe this guy has feelings. Maybe I should cut him some slack. Because maybe, just maybe... this guy's gonna turn out to be, uh...I dunno...a King! And maybe his first royal decree will be to banish everyone who ever picked on him -- that's right, I'm looking at you, jousting team.
And Gwen... oh Gwen. I've always loved you.
Ew.
Well good friends, it breaks my heart, but, enjoy your stay here in prison while I rule the free world baby!
Alright, let's not overdo it.
I'm building my city people! On Rock and Roll!
You just overdid it.
Ow!
 Oh!
Look at you!
Wow!
You look darling! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 44.
Just precious! Look at her!
So, have you had any cravings since you've been pregnant?
 No, no, not at all.
Do you smell ham?
 Oooh! It's present time!
Oh, Fiona, won't you please open mine first? It's the one in front.
 "Congratulations on your new mess maker..." Oh, `mess maker.'  "Hopefully this helps. Love, Cinderella."
Oooo! Aaaah!
Will you look at that!
What is it? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 45.
It's for the poopies.
Eww. Wait, babies poop?
Everyone poops Beauty.
Fiona...
Fiona! We all chipped in for a little present too.
Yah!
Ta dah!
Oooh.
You know the baby's gonna love it because I do!
Oh, you guys, that's so sweet. Thank you.
Who's this one from?
I got you the biggest one because I love you the most.
 "Have one on me, love Snow White" Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 46.
 Umm... what is it?
Ha, haaa! He's a live-in baby- sitter.
Where's the baby?
You're too kind, Snow, but I can't accept this.
Think nothing of it. I've got six more at home.
What does he do?
The cleaning.
The feeding.
The burping.
So what are Shrek and I supposed to do?
Well, now you'll have plenty of time to work on your marriage.
Gee thanks Rapunzel, and what's that supposed to mean?
Oh, come on now, Fiona. You know what happens.
 Huh? You're tired all the time...
You'll start letting yourself go...
Stretch marks!
Say goodbye to romance.
Yort.
Um sorry... but how many of you have kids?
She's right. A baby is only gonna strengthen the love that Shrek and Fiona have. How did Shrek react when you told him? Tell me!
Well, when he first found out...Shrek said-
Roarrr!
 Onward my new friends.  Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 48. PRINCE CHARMING To our happily ever afters! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Gaa! Gulp! Ahhhh!
Now, bombs away!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Well, well, well. If it isn't Peter Pan.
His name's not Peter!
Shut it, Wendy!
Ahhh!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Enough pillaging! To the castle!
Roarrrr!
 You go and take care of the baby!
Everybody stay calm. We're all going to die!
EMPTY_LINE
Everyone in! Now.
C'mon. Put some back into it people!
Yee-haw! Ow.
We don't have time. Now go!
Quickly ladies!
We'll hold them off as long as we can!
Where are Shrek and Fiona?
Name doesn't ring a bell.
Yah!
No bell!
I suggest you freaks cooperate with the new King of Far Far Away.
The only thing you're ever gonna be King of is "King of the Stupids."
Hook!
Right!
Avast, ye cookie!
Start talkin'!
Gingy! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 52.
Papa!
Settle down, now.
 "On the Good Ship Lollypop, It's a sweet trip, To the candy shop, Where the Bon Bons play, On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay.."
You! You can't lie. So tell me puppet... Where is Shrek?!
 Well, I don't know where he's not.
You're telling me you don't know where Shrek is?
It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume that I couldn't exactly not say that is or isn't almost partially incorrect.
So you do know where he is!
On the contrary, I'm possibly more or less, not definitely rejecting the idea, that in no way, with any amount of uncertainty that...
Stop it.
...I undeniably do or do not know where he shouldn't probably be. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 54.
If that indeed wasn't where he isn't. Even if he wasn't not where I knew he was could mean that I wouldn't completely not know where he wasn't.
Oh, enough! Shrek went off to bring back the next heir! Oh!
He's bringing back the next heir?
No!
Hook! Get rid of this new "King."
Right!
But bring Shrek to me. I have something special in mind for him.
He'll never fall for your tricks!
Oh boy.
I can't believe it... me a King? I...I mean I knew I came from royalty and all, but I just figured everyone forgot about me.
Oh no, in fact, the King asked for you personally.
Really? Wow! Look, I know it's not all gonna be fun and games.
It really is all fun and games, actually. Sure, you have to knight a few heroes, launch a ship or two. By the way, make sure you hit the boat just right with the bottle.
Boat with the bottle? Any idiot can hit a boat with a bottle.
Well, I've heard it's harder than it looks.
Whoa!! This is gonna be huge. Parties, princesses, castles... princesses.
It's gonna be great, Artie. You'll be living in the lap of luxury. They got the finest chefs around waiting for you to place your order.
And fortunately you'll have the royal food tasters. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 56.
 Oh yeah? What do they do?
They taste the food before the King eats, to make sure it's not poisoned.
Poisoned?
Or too salty!
 Don't worry about it. You'll be safe and sound with the help of your body guards.
Body guards?
All of them, willing at a moment's notice to lay down their own lives out of devotion to you.
Really?
Si, and the whole kingdom will look to you for wisdom and guidance.
Just make sure they don't die of famine.
Or plague.
Oh, plague is bad. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 57.
The coughing, the groaning, the festering sores.
Oh! Festering sores! Hey, you are one funny kitty cat.
What did I say?
We don't want Artie here getting the wrong idea.
Uh, Artie?
Whoa!
Whoa! Oh, there goes my hip.
Artie!
What are you doing?!
What does it look like?!
This really isn't up to you!
But I don't know anything about being King!
You'll learn on the job!
Whoaaa!
Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm going back!
Back to what? Being a loser?!
Now look what you did!
Look what I did? Who's holding the wheel chief?
 Shrek!
Land ho!
How humiliating...
Oh, nice going, Your Highness.
Oh, so now it's "Your highness?" What happened to "loser?" Huh?
Hey, if you think this is getting you out of anything, well it isn't. We're heading back to Far Far Away one way or another, and you're gonna be a father!
What?
 A-hem. You just said father...
You're... I said king. You're gonna be King!
 "You're gonna be King!" Yeah right. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 60.
Where do you think you're going?
Far Far Away... from you!
You get back here young man and I mean it!
Uh boss, I don't think he's coming back and maybe it's for the best. He is not exactly king material.
When were you planning on telling him that you were really supposed to be King?
Oh c'mon, now why would I do that? Besides, he'll be ten times better at it than me.
Hey, woah ho ho, Shrek. Then you're gonna have to change your tactics if you want to get anywhere with this kid.
You're right, Donkey.
What about this?
Shrek!
Oh c'mon. It's just a joke.  Still...
Listen Artie...
If you think this whole mad scene ain't dope, I feel you dude. I mean, I'm not trying to get up in your grill or raise your roof or whatever, but what I am screaming is, yo, check out this kazing thazing bazaby.
I mean, if it doesn't groove or what I'm saying ain't straight trippin', just say, oh no you didn't, you know, you're gettin' on my last nerve. And then I'll know it's... then I'll know it's whack--
SOMEBODY HELP! I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY A MONSTER TRYING TO RELATE TO ME!
Artie! Wait!
C'mon! C'mon! Help! Help! Hello?
AHHHH!
Greetings cosmic children of the universe, and welcome to my serenity circle!
Please leave any bad vibes outside the healing vortex. And now prepare ...
I knew I should of gotten that warranty!
AHH! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
Mr. Merlin?
You know this guy?
Yeah. He was the school's magic teacher until he had his nervous breakdown.
Uh, technically I was merely a victim of a level three fatigue, and at the request of my therapist and the school authorities, I have retired to the tranquility of nature to discover my divine purpose.
Now, can I interest anyone in a snack or beverage?
Uh, no.
Sure you don't wanna try my famous rock au-gratin?
It's organic!
Oh, thanks, I just ate a boulder on the way in. What we need are directions back to Far Far Away.
What's with the "we"? Who said I was going with you?
Oh, I did. Cause there's a lot of people counting on you so don't try and weasel out of it.
If it's such a great job, why don't you do it?
Understand this kid, it's no more Mr. Nice Guy from here on out!
Oh, so that was your "Mr. Nice Guy?"
I know, and I'm gonna miss him.
You know what? Why don't you go terrorize a village and leave me alone?
Oh, is that some kind of crack about ogres? You get your royal highness to Far Far Away before I kick it there.  Now which way am I kicking?
Oh, I could tell you. But since you're in the midst of self- destructive rage spiral it would be karmic-ly irresponsible.
Self-destructive ra...  Look, are you gonna help us or not? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 65.
Most definitely, but only after you take the journey to your soul.
Yeah, I don't think so.
Look pal, it's either that or some primal scream therapy. Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Alright, alright... journey to the soul...
Now all of you, look into the "Fire of Truth" and tell me what you see! Yah! Ha!  Woo-looo-looo-looo!
Ooo! Charades! Okay, I see a dutch fudge torte with cinnamon swirls.
Okay. Monster, go for it.
I see a rainbow pony. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 66.
Excellent work!  Now! The boy!
This is lame.
Ow!
You're lame! Now just go for it.
Okay. There's a baby bird and a father bird sitting in a nest.
Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it!
Wait, the dad just flew away. Why did he leave the little bird all alone?
It's trying to fly, but it doesn't know how to. It.. it's gonna fall!
Whew, proper head case you are, aren't you? Really messed up. Whoa.
Yeah, yeah, okay. I get it. The bird's me. My dad left. So what?
 Look Artie...um-
 Just thought I might help set the mood! Y'know for your big heart to heart chat!
I know what it's like to not feel ready for something.
Even ogres get scared...you know, once in a while.
I know you want me to be king, but I can't. I'm not cut out for it and I never will be, alright?
Even my own dad knew I wasn't worth the trouble. He dumped me at that school the first chance he got and I never heard from him again. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 68.
My dad wasn't really the fatherly type either.
Well, I doubt he was worse than mine.
Oh yeah? My father was an ogre. He tried to eat me.
Now, I guess I should have seen it coming. He used to give me a bath in barbecue sauce and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.
Okay... I guess that's... pretty bad.
You know, it may be hard to believe what with my obvious charm and good looks, but people used to think that I was a monster. And for a long time, I believed them.
But after awhile, you learn to ignore the names that people call you and you just trust who you are.
You know, you're okay, Shrek.
You just need to do a little less yelling and use a little more soap. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 69.
Thanks Artie.
The soap's because you stink. Really bad.
Yeah. I got that.
Oh this place is filthy. I feel like a hobo.
I'm sorry but this just isn't working for me.
Everything's always about you, isn't it? It's not like your attitude is helping, Snow.
Well maybe it just bothers you that I was voted fairest in the land.
You mean in that rigged election?
Oh, give me a break.   Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 70. SNOW WHITE "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down thy golden extensions!"
Ladies, let go of your petty complaints and let's work together.
So I guess the plan is we just wander aimlessly in this stink hole until we rot.
No, we're gonna get inside and find out what Charming's up to.
I know he's a jerk and everything, but I gotta admit, that Charming makes me hotter than July.
Ew!
Ugh.
That's it!
Come on, this way!
Rapunzel. Wait!
Charming, let go of her.
But why would I want to do that?
Grrrr!
Woof!
What?
Say hello ladies, to the new Queen of Far Far Away.
Yaaaaaaaaay!
Rapunzel, how could you?
Jealous much?
Soon you'll be back where you started... scrubbing floors or locked away in towers; that is, if I let you last the week.
But Pooky, you promised you wouldn't hurt them!
Not here, "kitten whiskers." Daddy will discuss it later. Now forgive us, we have a show to put on.
Shrek will be back soon Charming, and you'll be sorry.
Sorry? Don't you realize --once Shrek sets foot in Far Far Away he's doomed?
Ow!
Ahhh!
Look out! They've got a piano!
Kill `em all. Except the fat one.
King Charming has something special in mind for you, ogre.
"King Charming?"
Attack!
AAAARGH!
Artie, Duck!
Ahhh!
Ha-ha! Argh!
Argh! Argh!
Ready the plank!
Shrek!
Help! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 75.
Ya cowards!
What has Charming done with Fiona?
She's gonna get what's coming to her.
Ahhh.  And there ain't nothing you can do to stop him!
We've got to save her!
But she's so far far away!
Get yourself back to Worcestershire, kid. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 76.
No, Shrek. Hold on a second. I've got an idea.
 I'm a buzzing bee, buzz, buzz, buzz...
Mr. Merlin, they need a spell to get them...I mean, us, back to Far Far Away.
 Forget it. I don't have that kind of magic in me anymore, kid. How about a hug instead? Hmm? That's the best kind of magic.
Mr. Merlin please. I know you can DO IT-
I said, forget it!
BUT-
Mumble, grumble, interrupt my healing. Mumble, mumble.
Oh. What, what's with you?
It's just so hard. You know? They really need to get back `cause their kingdom's in trouble `cause there's a really bad man and it's just so hard...
C'mon, take it easy.
No! I don't think you understand! There's a mean person doing mean things to good people-
Oh, have a heart old man!
And they really need your help to get them back! So why won't you help them?
Oh.
Uh, Okay... I'll go and get my things.
Piece of cake. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 78.
Well, well, well. You want some eggs with that ham?
Now, I am a little rusty, so there could be some side effects.
Side effects!?
Don't worry, whatever it is, no matter how excruciatingly painful it may be, it'll wear off eventually... I think.
Ah!
Oops.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Look, if Artie trusts him, that's good enough for me. Even if his robe doesn't quite cover his-
Alacraticious expeditious, a zoomy zoom zoom. Let's help our friends get back, um... soon!
Woah! It worked!
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 79.
EMPTY_LINE
 Oh man, I haven't been on a trip like that since college.
Donkey?
 What? Is there something in my teeth?
 Huh? What the?  Oh no!
 I've been abracadabra'd into a fancy feasting second rate sidekick.
 At least you don't look like some kind of bloated roadside piata. You really should think about going on a diet! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 80.
 Yeah, and you should think about getting yourself a pair of pants! I feel all exposed and nasty.
 Oh, so you two think this is funny?
 I'm really sorry guys.
Don't be! You got us back kid.
 Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. How in the Hans Christian Andersen am I supposed to parade around in these goofy boots?
Be very careful with those - HEE HAW!
They were made in Madrid by the finest- HEE HAW! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 81.
 Oh, you'll learn to control that.
Seriously man, you need some comfort inserts or arch supports or something.  Woah!
Woohoo!!
Pinocchio? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 82.
Shrek!
Pinocchio!
Help me!
What's happened?
Charming and the Villains have taken over everything! They attacked us but Fiona and the Princesses got away. And now she's-
She's what?! She's what!?
 Puss, loan me five bucks!
C'mon Puss, you heard the man, help a brother out.
 Do you see any pockets on me?
 Hold on a second.
 Aha!
 I had no idea ...really ...I swear.
Quick, Pinocchio. Where is Fiona?
Charming's got her locked away some place secret. You gotta find him! He's probably getting ready for the SHOWWWW---
Wait, wait, wait! Pinocchio! What show?
 It's A Happily Ever After, After All!
Shrek's final performance.
 Whoa, Shrek! You didn't tell us you were in a play.
Well I guess I've been so busy I forgot to mention it! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 84.
It's the ogre! Get him!
 Don't worry, Jefe. I got this.
Ugh! Kill it!
Look, don't you know who he thinks he is? How dare you?
Donkey, we're dealing with amateurs.
He's a star people! Hello?! I'm so sorry about this Mr. Shrek.
I'm gonna lose it!
I assume you have everything ready for tonight! You did get the list for the dressing room?
 Yeah, the breakfast croissants stuffed with seared sashimi tuna. Oh, and please tell me you at least have the saffron corn with the jalapeno honey butter cause our client cannot get into his proper emotional state without his jalapeno honey butter.
I just lost it!
Uh...Maybe they should talk to Nancy in Human Resources.
 Oh, we'll have much to say to Nancy, I promise!
 With this sword, I do- No.
With this sword, I do smote thee! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 86.
 Is that the right word? "Smote?" "Smooote." Is that even a word actually? Maybe I should just smite him.
Let's try this again. Now...
 Shrek attacks me, I pretend to be afraid.  Ooh!!!
I say...  "Finally the Kingdom will get the happily ever after they deserve, die Ogre", blah, blah, blah...
Oh! It just doesn't feel real enough yet!
Who told you to stop dancing?!
Uh... Wink and turn, wink and turn. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 87.
And what are you laying around for? Get up! Honestly.
Our happily ever after is nearly complete, mummy. And I assure you, the people of this kingdom will pay dearly for every second we've had to wait.
Break a leg. Or, on second thought, let me break it for you.
Thank goodness you're here. I was beginning to think you might not make it back in... time.
Where's Fiona?
Don't worry. She and the others are safe. For now.
Ow.
Let me guess... Arthur?
It's Artie, actually.
This boy is supposed to be the new King of Far Far Away?
How pathetic! Now, stand still so I won't make a mess.
Charming, stop! I'm here now, you got what you wanted. This isn't about him.
Then who's it about? I'm supposed to be King, right?
You weren't really next in line for the throne, okay? I was.
But you said the King asked for me personally.
Not exactly.
What's that supposed to mean?
Look, I said whatever I had to say, alright! I wasn't right for the job, I just needed some fool to replace me, and you fit the bill. So just go!
You were playing me the whole time.
You catch on real fast kid... Maybe you're not as big of a loser as I thought.
You know, for a minute there, I actually thought you -
What? That he cared about you? He's an ogre. What did you expect? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 90.
You really do have a way with children, Shrek.
Had we just stayed put like I suggested, we could be sipping tea out of little heart-shaped cups... Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 91.
Yeah... yeah, heart shaped cups.
Eating crumpets smothered with loganberries.
Yeah... loganberries.
Shut up Cindy.
Yeah, shut up.
No! You shut up!
Just stay out of this!
Who cares who's running the kingdom anyway?
I care.
And you should all care too.
 Hey, hey, hey, hey.
 Yeah, and I have your badge number, "TIN CAN-"
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 92.
Donkey?!
 Princess?!
Puss?!
 Lo siento, Princessa, but I am Puss, stuck here inside this hideous body.
 And I'm me!
BUT YOU'RE-
 I know, I know. Everything's a little fruity in the loops right now. But what happened is, we went to high school, the boat crashed, and we got "bippity-bopity-booped" by the "Magic Man."
You poor sweet things.
I don't get it.
The cat turned into a little horse that smells like feet. What's to get?
 Huh? Who dat?
Where's Shrek? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 93.
Charming's got him, Princess. And he plans on killing Shrek tonight in front of the whole kingdom.
Alright everyone, we need to find a way out, now.
You're right.  Ladies, assume the position!
What are you doing?
Waiting to be rescued.
You have got to be kidding me.
Well, what do you expect us to do? We're just four...  I mean, three, super hot princesses, two circus freaks, a pregnant ogre and an old lady.
Hmmm. Excuse me. Old lady coming through.
Hiiiyyyiiiaaaah!
Whoa.
Mom!?
Well, you didn't actually think you got your fighting skills from your father, did you?
Excuse me, I think there's still one more.
Hmmmm.
Hiiiiyah!
Why don't you just lie down?
Okay girls, from here on out, we're gonna take care of business ourselves.
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 95.
Ladies and gentlemen. The Far Far Away Theatre at the Charming Pavilion is proud to present: "It's a Happily Ever After, After All."
Oww, easy.
Sorry. I guess I was just showing off for the little one.
Huh?
It's "Bring your kids to work day." C'mere beautiful.
Well... she's got your eye.
Who woulda thought a monster like me deserves something as special as you?
 "Ahh ha ha ha ha haa."
 "Ahh ha ha ha haa."
 "Ha ha ha ha haaaa. Little birdies take wing, flitting down from the trees they appear, and to chirp in my ear."
 "All because I sing. Ahh ha ha ha ha haaa."
 "Ahh ha ha ha ha haaa."
 "Ha ha ha ha ha haaaaaaa!"
Ahhaha!! Ahhaha!!!
Move it! Go! Go! Go!
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 98.
 My babies!
 Help! Ow!
 Hey!
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 99.
Hey. How's it going?
 "O" to the "K." The coast has cleared.
 All right people, let's do this thing! Go Team Dy-No-Mite!!
I thought we agreed we would go by the name of "Team Super Cool."
As I recall it was "Team Awesome."
I voted for "Team Alpha Wolf Squadron."
Alright! Alright! Alright! From henceforth we are to be known as "Team Alpha Super Awesome Cool Dynomite Wolf Squadron."
Ach to Lieber! There is some strange little girl over there staring at us!
 Artie!
 Wait, wait, wait, wait wait. Hey! Where is the fire, Senor?
Oh please, don't act so innocent. You both knew what was going on the whole time and you kept it to yourself.
 Artie, it's not like it seems.
It's not? I think it seems pretty clear. He was using me. That's all there is to it.
 Using you? Man, you really don't get it!
 Shrek only said those things to protect you!
 Charming was going to kill you Artie. Shrek saved your life.
Cue the spot!
 "I wait alone up here. I'm trapped another day. Locked up here - please set me free. My new life I almost see, A castle, you and me. Yes, a castle you and me..."
Cherubs!
 "Tis I! Tis I! Upon my regal steed! Princess, my love, at last you shall be freed!"
 "I'm strong and brave, and dashing my way there! With speed! With might! With soft and bouncy hair!"
 "Through the blistering desert..." Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 103.
 "Hot!"
 "Across the stormiest sea."
 "Wet!"
 "Facing creatures so vile!"
 "Foul!"
 "So you can gaze upon me!"
 "I knew you'd come for me. And now we finally meet."
 "I knew you'd wait. And from my plate of love you'd eat." Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 104.
Roar! Roar!
 "Who is this terrible ugly fiend who so rudely intervened?"
 "Will Charming fight? Or will he flee?"
 "Oh please, rescue me!"
 "From this monstrosity!" Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 105.
 "Fear thee not Honey Lamb! I will slice this thing up like a HAM!"
Oh boy.
You are about to enter a world of pain with which you are NOT-  "FamiliaAAAAAAR!"
Well it can't be anymore painful than the lousy performance you're giving.
"Prepare foul beast."
 "Prepare foul beast, your time is done."
Oooh, if you don't mind could you kill me, and then sing? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 106.
Be quiet!
Oh, come on, I'm just havin' fun with ya. That's actually a very nice leotard.
Thank you.
Do they come in men's sizes?
He, he. Now that be funny.
ENOUGH!
Now you'll finally know what it's like to have everything you've worked for, everything that's precious to you taken away.
Now you'll know how I felt.
Ahhhhh!
Roar! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 107.
Sausage Roll!!
Arg.
 Pray for mercy from...
 ...Puss!
 And Donkey!
 Hey. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 108.
Hi honey! Sorry we're late. You okay?
Much better, now that you're here.
Awwwwwww!
So Charming, you wanna let me out of these so we can settle this ogre to man?
Oooh, that sounds fun. But I have a better idea!
Fiona! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 109.
No! Let go of me!
You will not ruin things this time ogre.  Kill it!
Everybody stop!
 Oh, what is it now?
Artie?
Who really thinks we need to settle things this way?
You're telling me you just want to be Villains your whole lives?
But we are Villains. It's the only thing we know.
Didn't you ever wish you could be something else?
You morons! Don't listen to him! ATTACK THEM-
Okay, fair enough. You're right. I'm not a talking tree. But, ya know, a good friend of mine once told me that just because people treat you like a villain, or an ogre...
... or just some loser...
...it doesn't mean you are one.
The thing that matters most is what you think of yourself.
If there's something you really want, or there's someone you really want to be, then the only person standing in your way ...is you.
Me?
Get `im lads!
No, no, no! What I mean is: each of you is standing in your own way!
Oooooooh!
I've always wanted to play the flute.
I`d like to open up a spa in France.
I grow daffodils!
And they're beautiful!
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 112.
Aaaahhhh!
A new era finally begins!
Now, all of you, bow before your king!
Ah-hem.
You need to work on your aim. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 113.
This was supposed to be my happily ever after.
Well I guess you need to keep looking...
...cause I'm not giving up mine.
Mommy?
It's yours if you want it, you know, but this time it's your choice.
Ar-tie! Ar-tie! Ar-tie! Ar-tie! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 114.
Uh, excuse me, that's my seat.
 Okay, senor hocus-y pocus-y. The time has come to rectify some wrongs!
 Although I have been enjoying these "cat baths."
 Please say you didn't.
Uh... alright, alright...look..
You're gonna feel a little pinch, and possibly some lower intestinal discomfort, but this should do the trick.
Are you..?
I'm me again! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 115.
And I am not you!
Alright!
Oops. Ah, never mind.
What'd I tell ya? I think the kid's going to be a great King.
Well, for what it's worth, you would have too.
I have something much more important in mind.
Ah, finally.
Da da.
Hey! I smell Shrek Jr.
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 117.
Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo.
Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy boy.
Hey.
Where's the baby?
Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 118.
Well, what shall we do now?
 I got it.
