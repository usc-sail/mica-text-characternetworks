Honey?
Oh.
Frau Sherin?
 Would you like a moment of privacy... before the casket is sealed?
Okay.
Danke.
David?
Could we just... sit in the courtyard for a minute? Just a minute.
Sure.
You need to enter your code now.
Is that really necessary?
I'm afraid so. International Law forbids the repatriation of an unsecured casket.
We did all we could. But there was some trauma, to the head.
Your code, bitte.
It's not impossible, Karolina. I've already made a few calls.
Thank you.
There are working Visas. The State Department issues them.
She's so attached to you.
I am... I'm so sorry. I...
I can reach you at your brother's, right?
Please. Try to sleep tonight.
Mommy?
Mommy?
Everything's in boxes.
Is Daddy in one of them?
No, sweetheart...
Doin' okay, Jules?
Almost there, Sweetheart.
Mommy?
I don't wanna go out there.
It's okay, Honey. I promise.
I don't wanna go out there. I'm scared.
What if I hid you? Would that be okay?  On my shoulder, under my coat...
The whole way?
Whole way.
Hey, look what I brought.
They're your favorite ones, right?
They're okay.
Julia?
 Julia.
What'd I tell you about wandering away from me in a public place?
I was hungry.
Doesn't matter. You scared me to de--  You got me really worried.
Sorry, mom.
It's okay. What kinda snack do you want?
Put your bag on the belt, Honey.  Don't worry. It'll come out the other side. Mommy's bag goes through too.
Stay where I can see you, Jules.
 You can go ahead, if you want.
It's just a second, Honey. They have to check something.
It's so big.
The biggest.
What kind is it, mom?
An Airjet. Brand new.
Did you make it?
Just some of its systems.
What if they fall?
Don't worry. They're not gonna fall.
But they could...
That's us. Got your ticket?  Let's go.
That's your seat, Sweetie.
I'm taking the window.
<u>I'm</u> taking it.
Dad said.
Did not. He said you had the <u>aisle</u>.
Shut up.
You shut up.
Both of you shut up!
I had the middle the whole way here.
Did not. We switched over Greenland.
Bobbbb...
Awright, kids. You heard your mom.
You don't even know where Greenland is.
Dadddddd.
Okay. We're Row 23. Now how're we gonna work this out?
Daddddddd!
That's nice, Rhett. Very big- brotherly of you.
Why's she get everything all the time?
Want some juice, Sweetie?
No, thanks.
Stop it!
I'm not doing anything.
Bob...
 Have a heart, okay? You know how Mom feels about airplanes.
Sorry, Mom.
Got two questions for you: What're the movies? And how loud do these headphones go?
Never quite loud enough.
Those back rows are starting to look pretty attractive.
Could be some high-maintenance in Row
I heard them.
The people two planes <u>away</u> heard them.
 Hey. Somebody tell the new kid - it's okay to laugh about the passengers.
Honey, it's okay to <u>hate</u> the passengers.
They just shut down Frankfurt.
Thank God we aren't going to Frankfurt.
We may not be going <u>anywhere</u>.
Good evening, Ladies and Gentleman, this is your Captain speaking. We've just received clearance to push away from the gate. Should be off the ground shortly.
Bob? Bob? What was that?!
I dunno, Honey. But I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.
They have to knock the ice off the wings, or the plane's too heavy.
You should tell her, mom.
Huh?
Maybe if you told her about your job she'd feel safer.
You just sleep, Sweetheart. When you wake up we'll be somewhere else.
Daddy too?
Yeah. Daddy too.
Hey, how'd ya like to have a whole row to yourself?
Huh?
Last couple rows are empty. We could take a couple seats each. Would ya like that?
Sorry, Honey. Mommy fell asl--
Ever seen this movie?
No.
Not too funny. 'Course, when you're at 35,000 feet you can't just up and walk out of the theatre, can ya?
Did you happen to see a little girl go by here?
No. Sure didn't.
My daughter.  How long've we been flying?
Two hours. A little more maybe.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for my daughter.
There's a girl in the galley, talking to some of the crew. could that be her?
Yes. Thank you.
No. She's <u>four</u>. My daughter.
Oh. Sorry. She hasn't been up here.
She has long hair. Probably carrying a chenille teddy bear with one arm.
What's she carrying with the other arm?
No, the bear. It only has--
Probably just found some other kids to play with.
I'm sorry, Ma'am. Would you mind using the other aisle?
I'm looking for my daughter.
Well, she can't have gone too far.
I'll go around.
 Shit!
 Is something wrong?
I can't find my daughter.  Did you happen to see her by any chance? Walking by?
I don't think so. How old is she?
She's four.
I never saw her.
Can I help you, Ma'am?
Ladies and Gentleman, I'm sorry to interrupt, but we've got a "first" to report.
Seems our Airjet is big enough to lose a child in.
Her name's Julia, age four. She's wearing a white t-shirt and a red cardigan sweater. If she's anywhere near you, or perhaps playing with one of your kids, please ring the call button now. We've got an anxious mom up here. Thank you.
Once again, her name's Julia.
All children should have to wear a cowbell.
Someone must've seen her.
Anybody check downstairs?
 We both did. She's not there.
We hafta start searching the plane. I don't know how to organize that...
Ma'am, I'm sure she's fine. There's no need to--
No. She's not herself right now. She's just been through something. Can we turn on the seatbelt sign?
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Ms.--?
Sherin.
Ms. Sherin. I'm sure she's--
There are nine closets on this plane. Seven up, two down. None of them have been checked. There're also seventeen galleys, and the crew quarters, and the holds. She has to be somewhere. I just need the aisles clear so I can look.
Tell you what: let's go back to your seat. I'll ask the Captain if he can step away from the Flight Deck.
 Are you in the airline business?
What?
You seem to know aircraft design.
I work for Airjet. Mechanical engineer.
Based in Berlin?
Look, I know you're just trying to keep me calm. But the problem here is not that I'm anxious. The problem is that my daughter is missing and nobody can tell me where the hell she is. Okay?
 I'm sorry. Do you have kids?
Do nieces count?
Almost.
They <u>hate</u> playing hide-and-seek with me because I <u>always</u> find them. So fear not.
 Did any of you see my little girl?
You're the one they made the announcement about?
Yes.
I didn't even know you had a kid with you.  Did you, Honey?
Sorry, I didn't. What's she look like?
You saw her, before. Four years old, dark hair in a ponytail.
Maybe you guys could help me look for her.
Cool.
Awesome! I'm <u>so</u> bored.
Sorry. No.
Dadddddd...
She's lost.
We're in a <u>tube</u>. How lost could she be? Turn around.
I'm sure the Captain will be here any minute.
What's wrong? What's happened?
I'm sorry. I need to speak to the Captain first.
If it has something to do with my daughter you need to speak to <u>me</u>.
Come with me.
Okay. What is it?
Ms. Sherin. I don't know how to--
Is she all right? Did something happen to her?
Ms. Sherin.
What. Say it.  <u>Say it</u>.
Ma'am... I don't think she's here.
What're you talking about?
I looked at the manifest. She isn't on it.
I don't understand.
There's no record of her having been on board.
The manifest lists 24-A as "unoccupied" and I did the headcount myself. I checked each seat.
So you missed one, she was hiding under a blanket.  What's that got to do with finding her <u>now</u>?
I also contacted the departure gate, in Berlin.  Ma'am, they say they never checked a Julia Sherin on to this plane.
She was with me. They checked us on together.
Would you like to see her boarding pass?
If you wouldn't mind.
I had it, right in this pocket. They were right here when I fell asleep, both boarding passes.
Ms. Sherin...?
Her backpack is gone.
She couldn't've reached up here by herself; she's not tall enough.  Somebody has her.
Ms. Sherin, that's quite an assumption. I don't--
How else did her stuff disappear? Can you think of another way?
I have to see the Captain.
I can ask him, Ma'am, but I can't guarantee that he'll--
There are people who like to do things to little girls. <i>Sick people.</i> You know that.
<u>I wanna see the Captain</u>.
Ms. Sherin, if you'll return to your seat I'll let the Captain know you want to see him.
 I'll tell him myself.
It is against regulations for you to--
Somebody has my daughter. Do you understand that?
What're you...?
Captain?  Captain? I have to speak to--
Ms. Sherin, I'm sorry I had to do that. But your behavior was constituting a threat to the safety of this aircraft.
 I need to see the--
I'm an Air Marshall. Can I let you go?
I'm not a threat to the--
Can I let you go?
Yes.
Gene Carson. Are you hurt?
I just wanna talk to the Captain.
I understand. But that's <u>his</u> call, not yours.  All clear, Captain.
The departure gate had no record of her?
No, Sir. I had them double-check.
And there's no boarding pass?
There was. It was taken from me.
 Did you tell him about the bear?
Bear?
Her teddy-bear. It was under the blanket, where she'd been sleeping. She wouldn't've walked away without it.
Have you had anything to drink on this flight, Ms. Sherin?  Anything alcoholic at all?
No.
Are you under any medication right now?
I have a few sleeping pills with me like every other passenger on board.
I'm also carrying Klonepin. They're for anxiety. I took two this morning.
I see. How long have you been on them?
I'm not "on" them.
How long?
I filled the prescription last week. That's when <i>my husband died.</i> My daughter and I are taking his body back to Long Island for the burial.
There is a casket in the hold, Captain. Paperwork's from Kaiser Wilhelm Hospital, on Hochstrasse.
He fell. The roof of our building. Six days ago.
I'm very sorry, Ma'am.
Does <u>anybody</u> on board remember seeing the girl? Passengers in her row?
No, Captain.
No, Sir.
You're seated near her - isn't that right, Mister Carson?
That's right.
Did <u>you</u> see her?
 No.
I want you to think about what you're suggesting, Captain. You're suggesting that I <u>imagined</u> bringing my daughter on board and am now <u>pretending</u> to be looking for her. Does that make sense to you? Can you think of any reason in the world why I would do that? I'm not drunk. I'm not loaded. I'm not looking for attention. I've worked on airplanes my whole life, same as you. The last thing I'd ever wanna do is disturb a flight.
There are <u>protocols</u> about these things. Post nine-eleven if a pilot finds that he's got an inaccurate passenger manifest, he's supposed to land at the nearest--
A teddy bear does not constitute an inaccurate passenger mani--
But I'm <u>telling</u> you it's inaccurate. That obligates you to do a real search, nose to tail. A thorough search. Like you would if <u>you</u> had a child that was missing.
Julia's only four, and she's not in very good shape right now. She just lost her father. Everything scares her. I had to hide her under my coat just to get her into the car this morning.  But she did get in that car. And she got on this plane, like everyone else. I fell asleep, which I never should've done... But she was sitting right next to me. When we took off. I held her hand.
 Please. You have to help her.
Get the lights up, get every passenger seated. No one in the lavatories, no exceptions. Open every closet and bin. We search for the girl, nose to tail, understand?
-The "Fasten Seatbelts" signs are lit. -Passengers waiting to use lavatories are instead shown to their seats. -Anna pins SIGNS on the lavatory doors, in German and English: "Out of Service - Please Do Not Use"
This is really silly.
This is <u>procedure</u>.
Yes, Captain.
Anybody in here? Hello?
I don't see what all the fuss is about. It's not like she lost her <u>Palm Pilot</u>.
As soon as the Captain's turned off the seatbelt sign, Sir.
Listen, I don't need an escort.
Captain seems to think someone should keep an eye on you. I can't imagine why.
 A few more steps, Katerina, and the nature of this search is going to change in a fundamental way.
Don't be a dunce.
By the way, you <u>could've</u> just identified yourself - the tackle was unneccesary.
An Air Marshall is required to use any means necessary to contain a threat to the safety of a flight.  Ladies with imaginary children, they qualify.
Tell me something: what happens when we land at Kennedy and everyone finds out that she'd been aboard all along? How're you gonna explain yourself? If there'd been a crime committed during the flight and you'd nothing to stop it - <i>the only law enforcement official on board.</i> How're you gonna account for that?
Somebody could be hurting her, right now, and you keep--
 Hey.  You made your point.
 You should have a look.
Why? Did you see anything?
No.
...it's just that I'm <i>dying</i> to watch you crawl through that hatch.
What's the problem?
May I help you?
I don't... Do I know you from somewhere?
You've walked past me five times since we took off. Does that count?
You're from Berlin?
 Am I being interrogated now?
Just wanted to know if you were from Berlin.
No. I am not.
Let's move along.
Sure. Sorry.
<u>Think</u> about what you're saying no to. I mean, it would be epic!
You're terrible!
I need to speak to the Captain again.
<u>I need to speak to the Captain</u>. Can you get him for me?
Okay. Can we look in the holds now?
Ms. Sherin, there's <u>no</u> conceivable way a child could've gained access to any of the holds.
There's access to the forward hold from Main Galley Number One. The food- cart elevator.
The call button's too high for a four year-old to reach.
So's the overhead bin, but her backpack is missing too. <u>She's with</u> <u>an adult</u>. I told you.
What adult? Every single passenger is in his seat, accounted for.
That's according to a manifest that we already know to be inaccurate.
It is not inaccurate!
Captain, we can't say we've thoroughly searched this aircraft until we've looked everywhere, and that means the holds.
I'm sorry, I can't allow that.
Goddammit! Are you <u>listening</u>?
I don't think it's a bad idea, Captain.
What?!
Might be good to have her below deck for a while. She's making people anxious.
Lemme go down there with her.
Mister Carson, I'm responsible for the safety of every passenger on this plane, even the delusional ones - and I cannot have a passenger out of her seat belt, bouncing around with the luggage bins in a cargo hold. One patch of turbulence and she could be seriously injured down there... And so could <u>you</u>, by the way. I don't fancy pulling into Kennedy with an unconscious Air Marshall on my hands.  Now, we are going to continue to search this aircraft from the waist up. If we don't find anybody, I'll send two members of my <i>crew</i> into the holds. I trust that that will be satisfactory to you.
I just <u>saw</u> two members of your crew, Captain - on their way back from "searching" the attic. They never even bothered to turn on their flashlights.
Ms. Sherin, there are 425 passengers on this flight who are NOT receiving any attention at the moment because everyone of my flight attendants is busy conducting a search for a child that none of them believe was ever on board. I'm sorry if you think we could be doing <u>more</u> to meet your needs, but you'll have to take it up with Customer Service after we land. Fair enough?
Captain?
Yes?
Can I speak to you for a moment?
Mister Carson, this woman is in your charge. I want her to remain in the passenger cabins. Is that understood?
Understood.
Thank you. Excuse me.
 I know where I've seen him before.
I know where I've seen you before!
Where's my daughter.
What?!
<u>Where's my daughter</u>?!
I don't know what you are talking a--
You were looking through her window last night.
Wait a minute.
I saw you looking across the courtyard into her room. Both of you.
You are a lunatic!
Where's my daughter?
Hold it. Back up. You've <u>seen</u> these men before?
No. She has not.
I <i>saw</i> them last night. Staring into my daughter's room.
 Is this correct, Sir?
I have never seen this woman before in my life.
Neither have I.
What would you expect them to say: "Ya got me?"
How 'bout we move this into one of the galleys?
No! He doesn't get a minute to think up an answer. I wanna know right now! Where'd you take my little girl?
I didn't do anything. I've never seen her!
Not that it's any of your concern, but I was at the <u>Hilton</u> last night. In Tiergarten - on business - we <u>both</u> were. And neither of us left the hotel. Would you like to see our bill?
 It's a bit unorthodox, but... if you wouldn't mind.
 A bill doesn't prove anything.
Satisfied?  Then I'd suggest you find two other Arabs to harass.
 Let's go.
What the hell does a bill prove?
Let's go.
 Where's my daughter? What've you done with her?
<u>I spent the night watching a movie.</u> <u>you fucking bullshit lunatic</u>!
Get a handle on this lady, will ya?
C'mere!
What're you doing?! They've got her!
Shut up!
Anyone <u>else</u> have any questions for me?!
Anyone else want to know where I've been and with whom I am associating?!
I can cuff you, understand that? I can confine you to your seat.
<u>They</u> have Julia. Why would you wanna cuff <u>me</u>?
What're those for?
I've got a seventy year-old in 20-B who can't hold his pee any longer.
Mine's six, about to wet his pants.
That's him.
They have Julia.
 You think those guys were surveilling you last night - is that it?
Yes.
For the purposes of kidnapping your daughter, stashing her in one of the holds until we land...
Yes.
Mind if I ask an obvious question?  If they knew where you lived, why wouldn't they just take her from your apartment? Why take her on an <u>airplane</u> where they'd have no possible means of escape?
I don't know.
And let's not forget: <i>her name isn't on the manifest.</i> How the hell could two pull passengers <i>that</i> off?
Obviously, they'd have to have someone from the crew involved.
Jesus Christ, it's a regular Grassy Knoll now! I suppose they've got a couple guys from the Grounds Crew at Kennedy in on it too - since once we land the only way to get her off this thing would be in a steamer trunk.
Excuse me.
 Think about what you're asking me to do, okay? You're asking me to approach two <u>Arabs</u> - on an airplane - and accuse them of enacting a criminal conspiracy. Think about the ramifications of that.
They have my daughter. I don't give a shit about being politically correct!
Fine. Let's go arrest the both of 'em... just as soon as you can answer one more question:  Why the hell would anybody wanna take your daughter?
What makes her so Goddamn special? What makes <u>you</u> so Goddamn special that they'd go to all this trouble... Unless you're some kind of closet- millionaire who gets a secret thrill out of flying coach.
Well?
What if they're hijacking the plane?
Ya know what, Lady - that swan dive your husband took is starting to make a whole lotta sense to me now. Couple hours with you and even <i>I'm ready to jump.</i>
David fell.  He <u>fell</u>.
I'm sorry. Fuck...
Okay. Go back to your seat. Wait there for me. Five minutes with no international incidents, okay? (can't believe I'm saying this but...) I'll talk to the Captain again, see what I can do about getting us into the hold.
Really?
How else am I gonna kill five hours watching soccer?
Ladies and Gentlemen, on behalf of our Captain we'd like to thank you for your patience during the unusual circumstances on this flight. As you can see, the Captain has turned <i>off</i> the fasten-seatbelt sign. You're now free to move about the cabin.
For your safety, we suggest that if you remain in your seat you do keep your seatbelt loosely fastened. Thank you.
 What's he doing?  <u>What is he doing</u>?
We haven't <u>found</u> her yet!
 What're you doing?
I need to speak to you.
Are we done looking? Is that it?
Just come with me.
No!
Ms. Sherin, we're not going to do this in the middle of the cabin.
Where's my daughter, Captain?
If you'll come with me, we can discuss it.
WHERE IS SHE!!!!
<u>She's <i>dead,</i> Goddammit</u>!
 You found her...?
No, Ms. Sherin, I didn't find her.
This is from Kaiser Wilhelm Hospital, on Hochstrasse. That's where your husband was pronounced dead, is that correct?
Yes.
David Sherin? six days ago? January 12?  Your daughter was also taken there.
No. Julia was at the park when it happened, with her nanny.
Ms. Sherin, according to the Director of the Morgue there, your daughter Julia died of internal injuries at 2:36 p.m. on January 13. Same time as your husband.
They went off that roof together. Didn't they?
No.
I'm very sorry.
No. Julia wasn't even home. She was at the park.
Maybe you should sit down.
She was at the park.
She wasn't even there.  <u>She wasn't even there.</u>
You're crazy. You're all crazy.
She was never on board.
I <u>carried</u> her on board...
Shouldn't somebody get her away from the door? <u>Could somebody get her away </u> <u>from the door</u>!
There's nothing to worry about, Ma'am.
Ms. Sherin, I can't tell you how sorry I am. I have a family too. Three daughters. And I can only imagine what you must be going through. No, I <u>can't</u> imagine. But my main resp--
She must be so scared...
--my main responsibility is the safety of these passengers. And I can't allow anyone, no matter how tragic their circumstances, to jeopardize that.
She doesn't know where she is...
Our Air Marshall is going to escort you back to your seat. He can handcuff you if you force him to. I'm hoping that won't be necessary.  As I said, I'm very sorry for your loss.  Mister Carson, will you see her back to her seat now?
Carson!
 How are you feeling?
Are you in pain?
We can get some aspirin if ya want.
My name is Lisa. The Captain thought you might want to... talk with me.  I'm a therapist.
I saw you - my seat is just a few rows up - and I ask if I can help. Please forgive my English.
I don't know you.
So many of my patients come to me after a loss. To grieve.  Parents. If they have lost a child.
Kids, turn around.
Mommmm.
<u>Turn around!</u>
Sometimes it is just <u>stopping</u>. Being still. Is that the right word? Allowing the pain to come.  Your husband. David. He was a very unhappy man?
<u>I don't know you</u>.
He couldn't work anymore.
I'm sorry?
David. He couldn't write anymore. He wanted to go back to New York.  I wouldn't. I didn't wanna give up my job.
Have you cried about that? Have you asked them to forgive you?  You never got to tell them how sorry you were. How guilty you feel. You must be carrying that now.
Last night I walked through the city, and he was <u>there</u>. <i>He was with me</i>.  We just walked. And he wasn't angry about it anymore. He'd forgiven me.
Can you forgive <u>him</u> - for taking her like he did?
Was Julia there too?
What?
Your walk, with David. Was Julia there too?
No. She was home. It was late.
I came home, and she was in bed. She came into his office, looking for me. And we talked until she was asleep again.
It is impossible to... move on, yes? If we haven't <i>accepted.</i>
You have to think... think of your husband and child as being on an island. A beautiful place.
They will always be there. And you can swim to them any time you need to, in your mind. They'll be there.
But that island... it is not a place where <u>you</u> can live. You have to let <u>them</u> be there. It's not your - how do you say? - not your place. Do you understand?
We believe what we want to, don't we?
Sometimes it's the only way one can go on.
 Am I allowed to use the restroom?
This lady any kind of threat to herself, Doctor? Alone, in a lavatory? Do I have to take her belt and shoelaces or something?
Of course not. She's going to be fine.  You're going to be fine.
Let's go.
'Scuse me.
I'll be standing right here.
 Hey.
Hey!
Be out in a second.
Cabin de-press?
No.
 Everyone, please give me your attention. There is no reason to panic! Place the mask over your face and use the straps on either side to tighten it.
Get the floor-lights up.
What'd you do to the lights? What're you fucking guys doing?!
 Where's Sherin?
You don't need a mask - we haven't lost pressure. <u>Where's Sherin</u>?
 Julia? Julia?
Julia? Can you hear me, Honey?
Julia? Are you in there, Honey?
Honey? Are you in there?
 Julia?
Shit!  I'm here, Honey. Mommy's here.
 David...
You have to open your eyes, Baby.
I need you to come back. I'm so scared.  I can't find Julia.
I can't find her, Honey... I'm so scared.
That's touching. Really.
<u>Don't</u>.
Don't.
What're you--?
Thank you.
Go.
Where's Julia?
I put her to sleep, just like I put <u>you</u> to sleep. Do what I tell you and you'll get her back, wide awake.
When?
Move.
<u>When do I get my daughter back</u>?
About fifty million dollars from now.
Yes?
I'm just trying to... I don't understand how you could do this.
You're right. It's appalling. I'm ashamed of myself, truly.
 Obviously, not a word. Or we will kill her.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we've now begun our descent into the New York area and the Captain has once again illuminated the fasten seatbelts sign. Should be arriving at Kennedy shortly.
We have some information concerning connecting flights. All passengers on Pan World Flight 18 to Los Angeles will be departing via Gate B-3. Pan World Flight 203 to Boston will be departing via Gate B-7. And all passengers remaining on <u>this</u> flight and continuing to Miami will be asked to deboard temporarily so that we may service the aircraft.
As always, a Pan World representative will be at the gate as you exit the aircraft should you have any questions.
How many people will be aboard? Do you know?
We're not standing in the middle of a parking lot, okay? Keep your voice down.
That's what this is, right? We land, I get interrogated, the plane takes off again, and I say I've planted a few bombs in the hold.  How many people will be aboard?
'Bout five hundred, last we checked. What's it to ya?
Here's the account number the money gets wired to.
What if I tell them the truth instead?
Huh?
What if I tell them the truth?
Well, I suppose they'll check the plane and find the plastique. Then they'll ask me how long you were alone in that hold, and I'll tell them certainly long enough to have put it there. Mechanical Engineer, a lady who'd sure as hell know how to bring down an airplane, distraught over her recent tragic losses, et cetera. And you'll do time, and I'll be out a boatload of money, and your daughter will be dead.  ...that is, unless you think they're likely to take your word over mine.
My husband didn't jump off that building, did he?  He didn't fall off it either.
No. He <u>flew</u> off it.
Did you want me to get her card for you?
We're all clear now.
Thank you, Captain.
Goodbye, Ms. Sherin. You probably won't believe this, but I wish you well.
We're all clear now. They've got us at Gate Twelve.  Fine. Pull a car up. I'll bring her down to you.  No. She won't be any problem.
Okay, they're coming with a car that's gonna take us to the airport police station. You are not to speak - either in the car or during your questioning. You're not even to ask for a lawyer. I'll be next to you the whole time. In about an hour, this plane'll be up again. Soon as word of it comes to me, I'll give you a sign. At that time you will announce that you've placed explosive charges on board. And you'll issue your demands.
When the money is wired, your little girl'll be set free. Happy endings all around. Got it?
Where is she now?
She's safe. She's fine. That's all you need to--
Is she still on the plane?
Of course not.
How'd you get her off?
Look, you need to keep your mind <u>clear</u> for the next few hours. I'm not gonna distract you with any kind of unnecessary--
I just wanna know where she is.
She's someplace no one's gonna look, okay?
<u>I wanna know where she is</u>!
Where'd you put her?
I put her with your husband.
 She's not...
Yes. She is. Went in right before we landed.
She'll wake up in about an hour, give or take, and find herself face to face with your husband. You fuck with me, even a little, and she'll <u>die</u> in there - there's about five hours worth of oxygen inside.
Now. Let's talk about your exit strategy.
After the money is wired you're going to--
Goddammit...
Goddammit!
How did you open it?
Beg your pardon?
My daughter. How'd you get the casket open?
That was the point of all this, wasn't it? That nobody could get the casket open but me?  So how'd you do it?
Whole time I'm running down this aisle I'm thinking, "Why aren't they moving faster?"  Almost walked right into it, didn't I? One more step, on to the jetway... and you could've shot me
Lady, you've got one hell of an imagination.
No. You kill me. And the ransom demand comes in anonymously. And my daughter never makes it off this plane. She was never <u>supposed</u> to make it off.  Was she?
 Yeah?  We're on our way. Be right down.
 Was she?
Let's go.
I can't. My daughter's still on board.
Okay. How 'bout now?
FBI's gonna have the <u>real</u> manifest, fellas. They're gonna <u>see</u> that she boarded the plane.
Goddammit.
Then they're gonna... call the hospital in Germany, find out she... was never admitted there.
Jesus. This is pathetic...
And who's in the middle of all those phony faxes?  <u>You</u>, Dummy.
 What's she talking about?
Nothing.
 Yeah?
I'm on it, okay?! The lady      It's over, don't you get fucking pissed herself, I       that? There isn't gonna be thought you'd appreciate my     any money. So why not just getting her cleaned up first!   tell me where she is? Jesus!
 You don't really wanna kill a little girl, do you?
Hey! I'm getting <u>really</u> sick of hearing about that fucking kid!
Now let's go!
No.
I will shoot you.
No you won't. That'd turn this whole plane into a crime scene; Police would impound it for days.  It's why he hasn't shot <u>you</u> yet either.
Gene?
The plan's in place. Nothing's changed. She's just trying to rattle you.
It's working.
Listen. You're starting to panic--
Okay. <u>Had enough now</u>?  <u>Had enough</u>?
Good. We're going to de-board now. You and me. And we're going to get in that car, just like we planned.
Something funny all the sudden?  Let's hear it.
What're you gonna do, blow us all up?
Yeah.
That seem like a good idea to you?
Haven't you heard? I'm <u>crazy</u>.
Go ahead. First one to die'll be your little girl.
Where the hell're you going?  Hey. I'm talking to you.
 I'll fucking kill you!
What the hell is going on up here?!
You guys watching a movie or something? Jesus.
I lost her.
What?!
She got away from me.
You gotta be kidding.
She got to the elevator. I think that puts her in the rear hold.
Is she armed?
'Course not.
 Get the Forward hold. I'll go aft.  You stay here, check the cabins.
 Fuck!
Julia? Honey?  Honey?
Julia?
Julia? Honey? Can you hear me?
C'mon, Honey. We gotta go.
Ms. Sherin?
 Whenever you're ready, Ma'am.
 Hey.
Mommy?
I'm here, Honey. I'm right here.
