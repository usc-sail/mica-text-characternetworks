I'm talkin' about friendship.  I'm talkin' about character.  I'm talkin' about--hell, Leo, I ain't embarassed to use the word--I'm talkin' about ethics.
When I fix a fight, say--if I pay a three-to-one favorite to throw a goddamn fight--I figure I got a right to expect that fight to go off at three- to-one.  But every time I lay a bet with this sonofabitch Bernie Bernheim, before I know it the odds is even up--or worse, I'm betting the short money. . .
. . . So its clear what I'm sayin'?
Clear as mud.
It's a wrong situation.  It's gettin' so a businessman can't expect no return from a fixed fight.  Now if you can't trust a fix, what can you trust?  For a good return you gotta go bettin' on chance, and then you're back with anarchy.  Right back inna jungle.  On account of the breakdown of ethics.  That's why ethics is important.  It's the grease makes us get along, what separates us from the animals, beasts a burden, beasts a prey.  Ethics.  Whereas Bernie Bernheim is a horse of a different color ethics- wise.  As in, he ain't got any.  He's stealin' from me plain and simple.
You sure it's Bernie, selling you out?
It ain't elves.
Nobody else knows about the fix?
No one that ain't got ethics.
What about the fighters you pay to tank out?
We only pick fighters we can put the fear of God in.
Any other bookies know?  You play anyone else's book?
I lay an occasional bet with Mink Larouie.
But it ain't Mink, I'll vouch for that.
How do you know?
It ain't Mink.  Mink is Bluepoint's boy.
Mm.  And of course, Bluepoint always knows about the fix.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Let it drift.  All it means is a lot of people know.
I guess you ain't been listening.  Sure other people know.  That's why we gotta go to this question of character, determine just who exactly is chiseling in an my fix.  And that's how we know it's Bernie Bernheim.  The Motzah Kid. 'Cause ethically, he's kinda shaky.
You know Bernie's chiseling you because he's a chiseler.  And you know he's a chiseler because he's chiseling you.
Sometimes you just know.
. . . So you wanna kill him.
For starters.
. . . Sorry, Caspar.  Bernie pays me for protec- tion.
. . . Listen, Leo, I ain't askin, for permission. I'm tellin' you as a courtesy.  I need to do this thing, so it's gonna get done.
Then I'm telling you as a courtesy that you'll have trouble.  You came here to see if I'd kick if you killed Bernie.  Well there's your answer.
Listen Leo, I pay off to you every month like a greengrocer--a lot more than the Motzah--and I'm sick a gettin' the high hat--
You pay off for protection, just like everyone else.  Far as I know--and what I don't know in this town ain't worth knowing--the cops haven't closed any of your dives and the O.A. hasn't touched any of your rackets.  You haven't bought any license to kill bookies and today I ain't selling any.  Now take your flunky and dangle.
Ya know I'm tryin'. . . I'm tryin not to raise my voice in anga.  I've always gone along to get along.  But you make me lay off the Matzoh and you're givin' me the needle.  I told you the sheeny was robbin' me blind, I told you I wanna put him in the ground and I'm telling you now I'm sick a the high hat.
. . . Youse fuckin' fancy-pants, all of ya.
 Johnny.  You're exactly as big as I let you be and no bigger and don't forget it.  Ever.
Ats right, Leo, you're the big-shot around here.
Twist a pig's ear.  Watch him squeal.
. . . Bad play, Leo.
Got up on the wrong side, huh?
Same side as always.
That's what I mean.  Still owe money to--who's your bookie?  Lazarre?
Mm.
I could put it right for you.
Thanxs Leo, I don't need it.
In a pig's eye.  You haven't played a winner in six weeks.  People'll speak ill of me if I let him break your legs.
People'll say I had it coming.
And they'll be right, but that ain't the point. Call me a big-hearted slob, but I'm gonna square it for ya.
Joi de vivre.
Well look, if your gonna laugh at me, the hell with you.
And with you.  I'll square myself with Lazarre if you don't mind.  Thats why God invented cards.
Name it.
Think about what protecting Bernie gets us. Think about what offending Caspar loses us.
Come on, Tommy, you know I don't like to think.
Yeah.  Well, think about whether you should start.
Wake up, Tommy.
I'm awake.
You're eyes were shut.
Who're you gonna believe?
. . . How'd I do?
What do you think.  You're a millionaire.  You gonna remember your friends?
. . . Where's my hat?
You bet it, ya moron.  Good thing the game broke up before you bet your shorts.
. . . Who left with my hat?
Verna.  Verna and Mink.
. . . Who?
Mink and Verna.
. . . Thunderclap running tonight?
Yeah.
What's she leave at?
Three-to-one, more'n likely.  Lay off, Tom.  You shouldn't go deeper in the hole.
Tell Lazarre I want five hundred on the nose.
You would have it.
. . . Somebody hit me?
Yeah.  Mink hit you.
. . . Whyzat?
You asked him to.
 Miss me?
You again.  What now?
I want my hat.
. . . Is that all you came for?
Yeah.  I want my hat.
I won it.  It's mine.
What're you gonna do with it?
Drop dead.
I need a drink.
Why didn't you say so.
'Lo, Tommy.  Sorry about the hour.
I'll live.  What's the rumpus?
Can i come in?
Sure.
I wouldn't mind. . . I tried calling earlier.
I got home late.
Well. . . Sorry about the hour.
Uh-huh.
. . . Not bad. . .
Better than the paint we sell at the club.
That it is. . . That it is. . .
Thought about cutting Bernie loose?
Can't do it, Tommy, can't do it. . . That's sort of why I'm. . . Tommy. . . I don't know where Verna is.
Uh-huh.
I know what you're thinking:  What else is new? But the situation now, I'm worried. . .
Verna can take care of herself.  Maybe better than you can.
What does that mean?
Want another?
No.  What does that mean?
How far has she got her hooks into you?
That's a hell of a question.
It's a grift, Leo.  If she didn't need you to protect her brother from Johnny Caspar, d'you think she'd still go with you on slow carriage rides through the park?  That is the deal, isn't it?  You keep Bernie under wraps 'till Caspar cools down?
Jesus but you're a prickly pear.  What's wrong with her wanting her brother taken care of?
Not a thing.  I don't blame her.  She sees the angle--which is you--and she plays it.  She's a grifter, just like her brother.  They probably had grifter parents and grifter grandparents and someday they'll each spawn little grifter kids--
Stop it, Tommy.  I don't like to hear my friends run down.  Even by other friends.
Friendship's got nothing to do with it.
The hell you say.  You do anything to help your friends.  Just like you do anything to kick your enemies.
Wrong, Leo.  You do things for a reason.
Okay, Tom, you know the angles--Christ, better than anybody.  But you're wrong about this.  You don't know what's in Verna's heart. . .
Leo, throw her down.  And her brother, too. Dump her.
Jesus, Tom. . . Verna's okay. . .
Yeah, you like her.  Like the Kaiser likes cabbage.  You're dizzy for her.
What of it?  Jesus, Tom, ain't you ever been bit by that bug?
Leo, if she's such an angel, why are you looking for her at four in the morning?
I put a tail on her this afternoon.
Hah!
Yeah, I asked Rug Daniels to follow her around-- just, you know, just to keep her out of trouble.
And to tell you what trouble she was managing to whip up herself.
It wasn't to spy, Tom; I was worried.  After that meeting with Caspar, well--you can't be too careful.
Uh-huh.  And what did Rug tell you that has you scurrying over here?
That's just it.  Nothing.  He's disappeared.
So you've lost your ladyfriend and the tail you put an her.
I guess it does sound pretty sorry at that. . .
You shouldn't be confronting Johnny Caspar, it's what I've been trying to tell you.  You can't trade body blows with him.  He's gotten too strong.
I reckon I can still trade body blows with any man in this town. . .
And Verna.
Okay, give me the needle.  I am a sap, I deserve it. . .
 Who was that?
Leo. . .
Did you tell him I was here?
No.
Did you put in a good word for my brother?
No.
You said you would.
. . . I said I'd think about it.
What did you tell him?
. . . Did you see Rug Daniels last night?
No.  What did you tell Leo?
. . . I told him you were a tramp and he should dump you.
You're a son of a bitch, Tom.
Hello, Beryl--
Ain't you got a conscience?
Mine's been mum lately--what'd I do?
Stood me up is all.  Made me wait an hour and a half is all?  Or maybe you don't remember sayin' you'd pick me up after work last night.  I seen heels in my time, sure, plenty of 'em!  But none so low as couldn't tell me to my face when they was sick of me! . . .
'Lo Tom.  What's the rumpus?
Mink.
. . . I see you got your hat back.
Yeah, what of it.
Not a thing, Tommy.  I got not a thing to say. Listen, Bernie wants to see you.  It's important.
Well I'm right here, and I'm not made of glass.
Yeah, but he's nervous walkin' around in public. He's a right guy, but he's nervous, Tommy!  He's very nervous!  Who wouldn't be?!
Mink--
The spot he's in, who wouldn't be!  He asked me to ask you to ask Leo to take care of him.  You know, put in a good word with Leo.  Leo listens to you.  Not that Leo wouldn't help the Motzoh anyway!  A guy like Bernie?  A square gee like the Motzah!  A straight shooter like him?
I don't get it, Mink--
What's to get?!  It's as plain as the nose--
I thought you were Bluepoint's sycophant.
Yeah Tom, that's right.  But a guy can have more than one friend, can't he?  Not that I'd want Bluepoint to know about it, but a square gee like the Motzah?  He's a right guy, Tom!  He's a straight shooter!  I know he's got a mixed reputation, but for a sheeny he's got a lot a good qualities!
Why should I care what happens to Bernie?
C'mon Tom, you like Bernie dontcha?
I don't like anybody, Mink, you know that.
Well, you like his sister.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing, Tom.  If it ain't my business I got not a thing to say.
What's going an between you and Bernie?
Nothin, Tom!  We're just friends--you know, amigos?
You're a fickle boy, Mink.  If Bluepoint found out you had another "amigo"--well, I don't peg him for the understanding type.
Find out!?  How would he find out?!  Damnit Tom, me and you ain't even been talking!  Jesus Tom, damnit, Jesus!
'Lo, Tom.  You know O'Gar. . .
. . . and the mayor.
I ought to.  I voted for him six times last May.
And that ain't the record, either.
Verna turned up.  She's downstairs.
. . . She say where she'd been?
No, I uh. . . didn't want to press her.  Hear about Rug?
Yeah, R.I.P.
They took his hair, Tommy.  Jesus that's strange. Why would they do that?
Maybe it was Injuns.
Eye-ties, more like it.  Giovanni Casparro.
So you figure it was Caspar bumped Rug?
. . . Well it's pretty obvious ain't it?
Mm. . . So what's the plan?
Jump on the guinea hard.  With both feet.
Yes, well. . . Leo here has just reminded us that Mr. Caspar operates several clubs in our city wherein the patrons imbibe of rum and play at games of chance.
And we're sunnosed to stop the party.
Uh-huh. . .
Naw, it ain't that, Tom.
Jesus, Tom!  We do as we're told!
Maybe they're right not to like it.  Stirring up this hornets' nest won't be good for anyone.  And it'll mean killing.
Well I'm not thrilled about it either, but I can't just lay down to Caspar.
You could do worse.  You might not like it, but giving up Bernie Bernheim is a pretty small price to pay for peace.  Business is business and a war's going to hurt everybody.  Bernie plays with fire, he's got to deal with the consequences-- even if that means he gets bumped off.
Sweet Jesus, Tom, that ain't even the point anymore.  Caspar pooped Rug.  The day I back down from a fight, Caspar is welcome to the rackets, this town, and my place at the table.  I didn't start this thing, but--
You did start it--you and Verna--
We can dangle, Leo, if you'd prefer.
Siddown Dale, we're all friends here.
--and Caspar hasn't broken the rules, Bernie has- -and you too, by helping him.  And if that isn't enough, consider that if you make it a war, you have more to lose than Caspar.
Okay, but more to beat him with.  Jesus, Tom, the two of us've faced worse odds.
But never without reason.  It helps to have one.
Aw, c'mon Tommy.  Its not like that. . .
Gimme a stiff one.
No small talk, huh?  They shoot vour nag?
If there's any justice.  Verna around?
She stepped into the ladies, room.  You got Lazarre's five hundred?
He'll have to carry me for a few days.
He ain't gonna like that.  Couldn't, you get it from Leo?
It's not Leo's debt.  I'll pay my own way.
I admire a man of principle.  Does this go on the tab?
Close your eyes, ladies, I'm coming through.
Who's the warpaint for?
Go home and dry out.
You don't need it for Leo, believe me.  He already thinks you're the original Miss Jesus.
. . . What the hell's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?  Afraid people might get the right idea?
Leo's got the right idea.  I like him, he's honest and he's got a heart.
Then its true what they say.  Opposites attract.
Do me a favor and mind your own business.
This is my business.  Intimidating helpless women is part of what I do.
Then find one and intimidate her.
Leo's upstairs getting ready to shoot himself in the foot on your account.
I don't know what you're talking about.
He's gonna go to the mat for your brother.  And it's gonna hurt him.
I don't know Leo's business, but he's a big boy.
He used to be.
Look.  What do you want, Tom?  You want me to pretend I don't care what happens to Bernie? Well I do.  He's my brother and I don't want him to get hurt.  If Leo wants to help him out I'll step out with him, show him a good time in return.  There's no harm in that.
There's a name for that kind of business arrange- ment.
I'll do what I have to for Bernie and there's no reason for you to try and queer that.  Regardless of what you think of me, Bernie's a decent guy.
A straight shooter, huh?  A square gee?
Yeah, sneer at him like everyone else.  Just because he's different.  People think he's a degenerate.  People think he's scum.  Well he's not.
Poor misunderstood Bernie.
. . . What is this about?  You want me to stop seeing Leo . . . Why don't you just say so?
I want you to quit spinning Leo in circles and pointing him where to go.
I forgot--that's your job, isn't it?
I'll do what I have to to protect Leo.  I'm asking you--politely, for me--to leave him alone. I don't have to ask.  If I told him about our little dance last night, your pull would dry up pretty fast.
So would yours.  I don't like being threatened.
I don't like being played for a sucker.  That game might work with Leo but it won't work with me.
You think last night was just more campaigning for my brother?
I can see the angles. . .
 You're a pathetic rumhead.
And I love you, Angel.
. . . I suppose you think you've raised hell.
Sister, when T've raised hell you'll know it.
Yeah. . .
'Lo, Tom.  What's the rumpus?
C'mon in, make yourself at home.
Yeah, you weren't here so I thought I'd do that. Didn't wanna answer the phone, though.  Figured it wasn't for me.
Uh-huh.
. . . I get it, get to the point, huh?  Okay. The point is: I'm a good guy.
I've heard that from a lot of people today.
Good guy, lot of friends--that's the way it works.  Maybe if you appreciated me a little more, you wouldn't be making waves with Leo.
Leo gets your sister, what're you selling me?
C'mon Tom, its not like that at all.  Wasn't my idea.  She'll sleep with anyone, you know that.  She's even tried to teach me a thing or two about bed artistry.  Can you believe that--my own sister!  Some crackpot idea about saving me from my friends. . .
She speaks highly of you.
Yeah, well, you stick by your family.  The point is, I can help you with your debts if that would make us friends.  My motto is, a guy can't have too many.  Big payday Saturday, Tom.  You could be in on it.
Another fix?  Which fight?
Well that's confidential at the moment.  But it doesn't have to stay that way.
How d'you know about it?  Caspar isn't laying any more bets with you.
Mm.
. . . You must really have Mink jumping through hoops.
Like I say, you can't have too many.
. . . I'll think about it.
I wouldn't want it any other way.
Cud. . .
Lazarre won't like it.
Try fifty across.
I'll try.  That'll make another one-fifty you owe him.
Only if I lose, Cud.
Tommy, the way you're goin'--horses got knees?
I dunno.  Fetlocks.
Well the way you're goin', if I was a horse I'd be down on my fetlocks prayin' you don't bet on me.
Drift, small guy.
Drop dead, ape.
C'mon Tom, my boss wants to see you.  He didn't have time to engrave nothin' formal.
I'll see you later, Tommy.  I gotta go spit.
Whaddya mean he's eatin' too much?  Whadduz the goddamn doctor know?
A hot dog.
Just a hot dog?
A hot dog and mustard.
A hot dog with mustard!  A hot dog with mustard! You hear that, Bluepoint!  The kids as smart as a whip!  Even Uncle Bluepoint thinks that's funny.
I ain't got a penny, boss.
Ah, well, that's a penny ya owe him.  'Lo Tom, what's the rumpus?  You like kids?
No.
Uh-huh.  Have a seat.  G'ahead.
. . . Thanks.
Always the yapper, huh?  Well, you're welcome. You wanna know why I'm putting you square with Lazarre?
Not particularly.
Bad feeling.  It ain't a good thing.  It's a poison, kid.  I want everybody to be friends.  I do this, you're friends with Lazarre, he's friends with you, and you're friends with me. And all you gotta do, show you're a friend, is to give me Bernie Bernheim.  You know it's the right thing anyway; I can't keep any discipline if I can't punish the people I need to punish.  The Motzah steals from me, I can't have Leo givin' him a shiny new penny. . .  You find some way to make Leo understand that.
So the deal is, I give you the Motzah, smooth it over with Leo, and you bail me out with Lazarre.
Yeah, then we're all friends again: You, me, Leo, Bluepoint.
We can maybe have tea sometime.
C'mon, Bluepoint.  Friends is a mental state. Wuddya say, kid?
. . . I'll think about it.
He'll think about it.  Hear that, Bluepoint? That's terrific.  The kid's a thinker.
Does he want a pillow for his head?
Okay kid, think about it.  It's a mental state. But make it quick, my family's waitin'.
I'll think about it and tell you later.
He needs to think in the thinking room.
Kid, if it'll help you think, you should know that if you don't do this you won't be in any shape to walk outa here.
. . . Would that be physically, or just a mental state?
. . . That ain't friendly, kid.  I make you a nice offer, I get the high hat.
Too bad for you, smart guy.
Hold it.
. . . Jesus, Tom.
Just in the nick of time, huh?
No harm done.  Unless your friend broke his foot.
. . . Wuzzit. . . How long. . . What day is it?
Friday, 12th of September, 1929.  Same as when you left us, about ten seconds ago. . .
. . . 'Lo, Tom.  Care to skin a knuckle an your playmate here?
No. . . thanks, Delahanty. . .
Well if you change your mind, we'll be inter- rogatin' for a while. . .
What was that party about, anyway?
We do this every weekend.
Jesus. . .
Well, they said make it hurt. . . So we make it hurt.
Drink, O'Gar?
I'm an duty.
To Volstead. . .
Still dead, far as I know.
Get a slug out of him?
Yeah, a .22.  Listen, Tom, I'm just the chief around here, so don't bother telling me if you don't happen to feel like it, but what the hell is Leo doing?
Ours is not to reason why, friend.
Balls.  Look at this mess.  Make him listen to you, Tom.  It ain't right, all this fuss over one sheeny.  Let Caspar have Bernie--Jesus, what's one Hebrew more or less?
Leo'll do what suits him, and you'll do what he tells you.  Last I heard Leo's still running this town.
He won't be for long if this keeps up.  It's no good for anyone--you said as much yourself.
First off, O'Gar, I can say what I please to Leo and about him. . .
Jesus, Tom, I was just speculatin' about a hypothesis.  I know I don't know nothin'.  It's just a damn mess is all--
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Hello, officer, I'd like to report an intruder at 346 West--
Who's this?. . . 'Lo, Shad, Tom Duchaisne here. We won't be needing any today. . . That's right, my mother.  She didn't recognize me.  Lemme talk to Mulvaney.
Drop dead.
. . . 'Lo Sean, tell O'Car to send a car over to Leo's tonight.  If we're going to be banging away at Caspar we ought to be ready for him to bang back. . . Yeah.
What do you want?
I was in the neighborhood, feeling a little daffy.  Thought I'd drop in for an apperitif.
Gee, that's tough.
Don't get hysterical.  I've had enough excitement for one nigit without a dame going all weepy on me.
I barely knew the gentleman.
Rug?  Bit of a shakedown artist.  Not above the occasional grift, but you'd understand that.  All in all not a bad guy, if looks, brains and personality don't count.
You better hope they don't.
. . . Yeah well, we're none of us the saint I hear your brother is.
Who killed him?
Leo thinks Caspar did.
But you know better.
I do now.  Caspar just tried to buy me into settling his tiff with Leo, which held hardly do if he was waging war.  So I figure you killed him, Angel.  You or Saint Bernard.
Why would I--or my brother--kill Rug Daniels or anybody else?
Rug was following you.  He knew about you and me. That wouldn't help your play with Leo, would it?
You think I murdered someone.  Come on, Tom, you know me a little.
Nobody knows anybody--not that well.
You know or you wouldn't be here.
Not at all, sugar.  I came to hear your side of the story--how horrible Rug was, how he goaded you into it, how he tried to shake you down--
That's not why you came either.
Tell me why I came.
The oldest reason there is.
There are friendlier places to drink.
Why can't you admit it?
Admit what?
Admit you don't like me seeing Lee because you're jealous.  Admit it isn't all cool calculation with you--that you've got a heart--even if it's small and feeble and you can't remember the last time you used it.
If I'd known we were going to cast our feelings into words I'd have memorized the Song of Solomon.
. . . Maybe that's why I like you, Tom.  I've never met anyone made being a sonofabitch such a point of pride.
Okay, Verna.  But until then, let's get stinko.
. . . Let's do something else first.
Yeah.  Let's do plenty.
Huhh. . .
Who's winning?
We are, for the nonce.
What's the disposish?
Last night?  Four to one.  Dana Cudahy went up with the house.
And theirs?
One burned.
The other three?
Lead.
Whose?
Leo's.
--well find him, goddamnit!  Go see if he fell in the john!  And get him, over here!
Can't raise O'Gar?
No, nor the mayor either.
Hmm.
They wouldn't dare.
I don't know, Leo.  I warned you not to hit Caspar's club--
I'm still here, ain't I?
Caspar's play hurt you anyway.
Hah!  That sorry sonofabitch just slit his own throat.  He just made me decide to step on him--
Listen to me Leo.  Last night made you look vulnerable.  You don't hold elected office in this town.  You run it because people think you run it.  Once they stop thinking it, you stop running it.
Jesus, Tom, sounds like a bad break for me I wasn't killed.
I mean it, Leo.  Start taking Caspar seriously.
Don't sing me the blues again, Tommy.  I need your help.  He shoots, we gotta answer--
That's what got you in this mess.
I know, I know.  Retreat to win.  Give up Bernie. That'll solve all our problems.
It won't anymore, I'll grant that.  Now its either you or Caspar.  But going toe-to-toe with a psychopath'll get you nowhere.  It'll force everyone to choose sides just when you're looking shaky.
The hell I do!
Then where's the mayor?  Why aren't there any police here?  Why weren't there police at your place last night?
I didn't ask for any.
I did.
Mother hen, huh?  What's the matter, Tommy, you think I can't take care of myself?
I know you can't.  Here's the smart play, Leo: you lay back, give up Bernie, let Caspar think he's made his point.  Wait for him to show you a weakness--
Please, Tom. . .
You're sticking on Bernie.  Sticking your neck out for a guy who'd chop you off at the heels if there was two bits in it.
. . . Tom, it ain't all as clear-cut as you make it. . . Bernie's--Well hell, you know about me and Verna. . . Things now are--not that I haven't been a gentleman, but. . . I, uh. . . I plan to ask her to marry me, Tom.
Do you think she wants you to?
How the hell do I know, Tom?. . .  I think she does. . . Yeah, 'course she does.  I know, I know, you think different but--well, we just differ on that.
Leo.
Course he did.
No.  Think about it.  Just this one time.  Who was Rug following?
. . . Huh?
It needn't have been that sinister.  A strange man, following her down a dark alley, late at night. . . I've told you, Leo, she can take care of herself.
. . . Tom, why're you saying that?  Christ, Tom. I just told you, I plan to. . .
They pulled a .22 slug out of him.  A pop gun, Leo--a woman's gun.
. . . That's a whiskey dream.  Verna wouldn't panic--shoot someone--just because he was following her.
On her account you'll burn the town down.
Don't worry, Tom.  We'll still be standing when the smoke clears.
Okay Leo.  Then maybe it wasn't that innocent. Maybe Rug knew something she didn't like him knowing, and wouldn't want you to know.  He was following her.  He knew who she was seeing.  He knew where she was sleeping, and who with. . .
Maybes don't make it so.
They're more than maybes.  You've trusted me before, and never lost anything by it.  Trust me on this.
This is too important.
I don't ask much, and I don't ask often.  Trist me on this.
Tommy--
Trust me on this or the hell with you.
You don't mean that.
. . . She was at my place.  The night Rug was following her; the night you dropped by.
Okay, Leo.  I'll throw him out.
. . . Yeah.  Do that. . . It's the kiss-off.  If I never see him again it'll be soon enough.
. . .'Lo Frankie its Tom, how's the flunky business?. . . I've had worse; your ventilator healing up?
. . . It worked, whatever you did; Leo told me we're quits.  But you know I didn't have anything to do with Rug.
Maybe not. . . Anyway, that isn't what soured him on you.
Oh, you and me, huh?  You always take the long way around to get what you want, don't you Tom. . . . You could have just asked.
. . . What did I want?
Me.
Yeah?
. . . You're still up?
Yeah.
. . . What're you chewing over?
. . . Remembering something. . .
What was it?
Just a dream.  I was walking in the woods, don't know why. . . The wind came up and blew my hat off. . .
And you chased it, right?  You ran and ran and finally you caught up to it and picked it up but it wasn't a hat anymore.  It had changed into something else--something wonderful.
No. It stayed a hat.  And no I didn't chase it. I watched it blow away. . .
Where're you going?
Out.
. . . Don't let on more than you have to.
Just have to do a few things.
You and Leo might still be able to patch things up.
Me and Leo are finished.  Nothing's going to change that.
You never know.  He's got a big heart.
We're quits--as far as I'm concerned, never mind him.  And if Leo did want me back he's an even bigger sap than I thought.
. . . Then why don't we just pick up and leave town?  There's nothing keeping you here.  I know there's nothing keeping me.
What about Bernie?
He could come with us.
You, me and Bernie.  Where would we go, Verna? Niagara Falls?
Why do you hate him?
I don't hate anyone.
Or like anyone.
Whatever.  Where is Bernie?
Why?
Leo can't protect him anymore.  I ought to tell him to skip.
The Royale.  Room three-oh-two.
Mm.
The two of us, we're about bad enough to deserve each other.
Are we?
We're a couple of heels, Tom.  Yes we are.
'Lo, Kid.  You know O'Gar. . .
. . . and the mayor.
'Lo, boys.
Tom's a big booster.  Always has been.
S'fine, s'fine.  Well, Tom and me's got the proverbial fat to chew--
Well, let us know if you need anything. . .
Yeah, happy days.  Have a seat, kid. . .
Yeah, well, circumstances have changed.
Don't I know it.  Last night, I know Bluepoint was disappointed the bulls showed up before Frankie and Tic-Tac could really pin your ears back, but I said, Relax, Bluepoint, I got a feeling about this kid.  Take the long view.  The kid and Leo are gonna go bust-o.  If the kid ain't ready yet, well, he soon will be.  Matter of time.  I said, the kid's too smart for Leo. That's what I said.  Like a psychic.  Ask Bluepoint if I didn't.  Like a goddamn psychic. G'ahead.  Ask him.
You vouch for this psychic business?
That's right, smart guy.
I know you knew protecting the Motzah was a dumb idea.  I know you been wise to all of Leo's dumb ideas lately.  Only a matter of time.  Bust-o.
Seeing how you squiffed your play on Leo, I can be only so grateful.
That's brave, coming from Little Miss Punching Bag.
C'mon Bluepoint.  Friends now, huh?
Nuts.
So we get a little jingle.  And I figure you know Leo's on his way out.  It's only a matter of time before we get him.  Am I right, kid?
Maybe.
What maybe.  You know or you wouldn't be bust-o. So I guess you're looking for a job?
I might be.
You got references?  You been to college, kid? We only take yeggs what's been to college.  Ain't that right, Bluepoint?
Yeah.  I can do plenty for you.  But the fact is that right now Leo's still got all his vital signs and once he hears about this he'll be more anxious to get to me than to either of you.
I'm tellin' ya not to worry about Leo.  We got plans for him.
Yeah?  What?
Not so fast there, Kaputnik.
. . . I think what the Bluepoint is trying to say is, there'll be time to talk about that.  That can be tabled for a later date.  See, the last time we jawed you gave-me the high hat.  So I guess I'm sayin', maybe we want your confidence before we give you ours.  You gotta put somethin' on the table.  Ante up.
Fair enough.  Where shall we start.
Hear that, Bluepoint?  All business!  I told you he was a good kid!  Where shall we start!  All business!. . .
The Royale.  Room three-oh-two.  You might find Mink with him.
The hell you say.
Sure, Bernie and Mink are as cozy as lice.
This guy's lying.
Why would I?
This guy's wrong.  This guy's all wrong.  Mink is clean and this clown is a smart guy.
Easy enough to find out, ain't it?  You find Mink, bring him back here.
And if he's not there?
I'll sit facing the corner in a funny hat.
Frankie, let me go, I'm prayin' to ya, Jesus God- -Tom!  Jesus!
. . . Are you part of this?!  You can't be part of this!  I think these guys're gonna whack me! You gotta talk to 'em, Tommy!
You gimme a headache, you little sheeny.
Okay, we're going to Miller's Crossing.
. . . Lets go!
You're not part of this!  Tom!  Help me!  These guys are gonna whack me!
Whack you inna mouth you don't shut up.
I don't want you runnin' anywhere.
Okay.  Take him in the woods and whack him.
Huh?  I don't. . .
Yeah, that's right, the boss wants you to do it. Make sure you're with the good guys.
You know how to do this, right?  You gotta remember to put one in his brain.  Your first shot puts him down, then you put one in his brain.  Then he's dead, then we go home.
Get up.
I can't get up!  I can't get up!
Get up and walk, you chiselin' little yid.
. . . Tommy, you can't do this.  You don't bump guys.  You're not like those animals back there. . .
. . . Tommy.
Shutup.  You're dead, get me?
I understand.  I'm dead.  God bless you--
Shutup.  You have to disappear.  You have to blow, for good.  Nobody can see you, nobody can know.
God bless you--
Go somewhere no one knows you.  Anyone sees you, you really are dead, I don't care, you're not my problem any more.
Of course not.  Of course not.  You've done your share.  Thank you.  Don't worry, I understand. Thank you--
Shutup. Just get the hell out, before I change my mind.
Put one in his brain?
. . . Yeah.
Attaboy.
Mink?  Tom Duchaisne.  Where've you been?. . .
'Lo, Terry.  Getting out the vote?
Message from Leo.  Leo says, if you're smart you'll sit this one out--not that he cares one way or the other.  Leo says if you're on the wrong side you take your chances, like anyone else.  Leo says he gives no special favors. That's all.
Mm. . .
One more thing. . .
Leo say that too. . . ?
No, I said that.  Cross Leo and next time I'll say plenty.
When you're right you're right, but you never say I told you so.
So what'm I right about?
Well, I'll tell ya, but first you gotta promise not to say I told you so.
I never say that.  And I don't like people who do.
Mink was robbin' me right along with the Mptzah.
. . . What convinced you of that?
Mink Larouie took a powder.  We can't find him. Bluepoint's makin' excuses for him, but personal- ly, I think you were right.  I think Mink and Bernie was in it together.  I think Mink heard you'd bumped the Motzah, and lit out.  The lousy sonofabitch.
. . . I told you so.
Okay.  You got a lip on ya.  Ats all right.  I don't generally care for it, but that's all right. . . You were a good sport to bump the Motzah.  I just like to make sure my friends is my friends.  So.
How d'you know Mink skipped?
Bluepoint can't find him.
So he says.
Meanin' what, exactly?
Maybe nothing. . . I didn't give it much thought until now, since a guy will say pretty much anything when he knows his number is up, but just before I bumped Bernie he swore to me that Bluepoint and Mink were setting him up.  That they were the ones that were selling out your fix.
'Zat so. . .
. . . Uh-huh.  So why isn't Bluepoint here?
Well. . .
Uh-huh. . . Course, there's always that wild card when love is involved. . .
. . . I know Mink is Bluepoint's boy, but I still don't make it that way.
Mm.  Well, then there's nothing to worry about.
Yeah. . .
Poppa!  Poppa!  I got a prize from the--
Just a minute.
Poppa!  Poppa!  The sisters gave me a--unnnh!
Shaddap!  You take a page outta this guy's book. A little less you talk and a little more you think!
. . . It ain't complicated.
You should leave town for a few days; things are going to heat up here.  Go out to the Pallisades; I'll join you once I'm done.
. . . I can't find Bernie.  Did you find him?
. . . Yeah.
Is he leaving?
He left.
Where to?
. . . He didn't say.  You should--
Thanks.
What's he up to?
I dunno.
That's Bernie's sister, isn't it?
I dunno.
What's he seeing her for?
I dunno, maybe he's--
Shutup.  Get outta the car.  Stick with the bighead.
C'mon, get up.  I just wanna talk.
Yeah, get up.  He ain't gonna hurt ya.
He already hurt me!  He broke my goddamn nose!
So what?  I had my nose broke once.
I already paid Leo's men.
You still pay Leo for protection?  Is he protec- tin' you?
We's protectin' you.  Johnny Caspar's runnin' things or maybe you ain't heard.
So Bluepoint hasn't got a line on Leo yet?
Not that I know about.  He's been lookin', but I guess Leo's been movin' around and--hoist this over the bar, will ya?--and thingslve been kinda hectic.
Do me a favor--let me know if he finds anything.
Yeah, okay--
I'm gonna put this one to sleep, wuddya think Bert?
Yeah, okay.
If you kill him he won't be able to think things over.
He don't seem like such a hot thinker.
You'll think about what you've learned here, won't you Louie?
You bet, Tom, I'll think plenty!
Ah, what the hell. . .
. . . If we can't trust a dago, the whole thing's hopeless anyway.
So, are we winning?
It's tough.  Leo's still got some teeth left. His men bushwhacked Tony Campisi last night, slit his throat.
Yeah?  He die?
I said, they slit his throat.
So what, genius?  I had my t'roat slit once.
Sure Whisper, but normal people's brains need oxygen--
Get the car, will ya Whisper?
Don't tell Bluepoint I was asking about him.
Yeah yeah.
Caspar just wanted me to check up, make sure he's doing everything he can--
Leo's man!  Up there!
. . . Up there!  Leo's--
'Lo, Tom.  Chalk one up for the good guys, huh?
Yeah, Caspar'll be thrilled.  You just shot one of his apes.
Bullshit!
I'm tellin' you that's Two-Toe Jackson!  He's Leo's!
It's Bert Sachetti, Caspar's bang-man.
Bullshit!  Take his shoes off.  Count his goddamn toes!
'Lo, Terry.  You weren't aiming at me, were you?
In the first place, I don't know what you're talking about.  In the second place, if I had been aiming at you I'd've hit you.  In the third place, I don't know what you're talking about in the first place.
Know who I am?
Yeah, Johnny Caspar's shadow.  Did he stay in bed today?
Jesus.  I open my mouth, the whole world turns smart. . .
None.
You're Leo's twist, right?
Me and Leo are through.
Yeah?  So you're sluttin' around with Tom now, huh?
Get outta here.
Okay, see ya later. . .
Nothing I know about.
Yeah?  It doesn't figure for me, your dumping Leo for the guy who put a bullet in your brother.
. . . You Leo's?
Yeah.  He wanted her looked out for.
Well you did a bang-up job; I'll be sure to tell him.  Where is Leo?
. . . If I tell you, how do know you won't kill me?
Because if you told me, and I killed you, and you were lying, then I wouldn't get to kill you then. Where's Leo?
. . . He's--he's moving around.  But tomorrow night he's getting his mob together at Whiskey Nick's.
You sure?
Check it.  It's gold.
You know something, yegg?  I believe you.
Go ahead and run, sweetie . . .
. . . I'll track down all a you whores.
'Lo, Bernie.  Come on in, make yourself at home.
'Lo, Tom.  Thought I'd do that, since you didn't seem to be in.  Figured it was a bad idea to wait in the hall, seeing as I'm supposed to be dead.
Mm.
How'd you know it was me?
You're the only person I know'd knock and break in.
Your other friends wouldn't break in, huh?
My other friends wanna kill me, so they wouldn't knock.
Things. . . I guess you must be kind of angry. I'm supposed to be gone, far away.  I guess it seems sort of irresponsible, my being here. . .
No.
'Course you know about it. . . its . . . It's a painful memory.  And I can't help remembering that you put the finger on me, and you took me out there to whack me. . . I know you didn't. . . I know you didn't shoot me. . . but. . . but--
But what have I done for you lately?
Don't smart me.
You make me laugh, Tommy.  You're gonna catch cold, then you're no good to me. . .
Why Mr. Duchaisne!  What on earth. . .
They took everything. . .
. . . I fought like hell but there were too many of 'em . . .
'Lo, Tony.  How's the club holding up?
We're managing to squeak by without you.  Got Lazarre's money?
No.
Well, you're not supposed to be here since you turned rat.
Relax, Tony, Leo's not around, is he?
Maybe Leo's not the only one doesn't care for you here.
. . . Fickle, huh Tony?  You could almost be a dame.
Pal, you read my mind, you sneak my thoughts. Jesus, I hope you know what you're doing.
No more than usual.  The last couple days, you booked any heavy bets on a long shot at Satur- day's fights?
Why the hell should I tell you?
The truth is Tony, there's no reason on earth.
. . . Saturday's fights.  Yeah.  Drop Johnson parked two yards on one yesterday.  On Sailor Reese, an undercard bum.
Drop Johnson?  He play your book much?
You kidding?  I didn't even know he could count.
Oh Jesus. . . You bring them with you?
No.
'Lo, Brian.  Still fighting the good fight?
'Lo, Tom.  Neither wind nor rain nor snow. . .
That's just the mailmen.  Is O'Gar here?
Just look for the long face.
'Lo, O'Gar.  You don't look happy.
Look at this mess.  Gutting the golden calf again.
Yeah, it's awful confusing.  You know a yegg named Drop Johnson?
We've spanked him a couple times.
Where does he flop?
The Terminal Hotel on Bay Street, whenever he's broke--which is one hundred percent of always. Jesus . . .
What's the matter, O'Gar, doesn't anything ever suit you?
Hop in, Tom, we been lookin' for you.
I'm busy.
Hop in anyway, as in you ain't got no choice.
You can't hijack me, Tic-Tac, we're on the same side now--or didn't you get that far in school?
How'd you get the fat lip?
Old war wound.  Acts up around morons.
Very smart.  What were you doing at the club? Talking things over with Leo?
Don't think so hard, Bluepoint, you might sprain something.
You're so goddamn smart.  Except you ain't.  I get you, smart guy, I know what you are. Straight as a corkscrew.  Mr. Inside-Outsky. Like a goddamn bolshevik, picking up your orders from Yegg Central.  You think you're so goddamn smart.
The boss just said have him do it, he didn't say nothing about--
Shutup, or maybe you still got too many teeth.
Y'understand if we don't find a stiff out here, we leave a fresh one.
Hey Tic-Tac, ever notice how the snappy dialogue dries up once a guy starts soiling his union suit?
What?
Think about this, smart guy.
Uh-oh, hankie time!
Birds been at him.
Jesus Christ. . .
. . . I said put one in his brain, not in his stinking face. . .
I told you, Bluepoint, we heard two shots. . .
'Lo, Drop.  How're the Katzenjammers?
'Lo, Tom.  What's the rumpus?
Had any visitors?
No.
Not ever, Drop?
. . . Not lately.
Then you must be happy to see me.
No.
. . . Seen him since?
One last question, Drop.  I hear you've got a lot of money on tomorrow's fight.  Is that your bet, or did you place it for a friend?
No, uh. . . it's my bet.  I just. . . I have a good feeling about that fight. . .
A good feeling, huh.  When did the feeling return to your head?
. . . Huh?
You've outgrown that one.  Must be all the thinking you've been doing. . .
All right.  Anyone left in there, come on out, grabbing air.  You know the drill.
'Lo, Tom, where've you been hiding?
Hither and yon.  The mayor in?
With Mr. Caspar.
That's who I'm looking for.  Scare up some hootch, will you honey?
Surely.  I'll announce you.
Don't bother, I'm well liked.
I can't do it, Johnny!  I'll look ridiculous! Why, it simply isn't done!  Assistants, maybe--
For a mayor, you don't hear so hot!  I said head! Head of the assessor's office!
But there's two of 'em!
I can count!  Co-heads!
Johnny, needless to say, this office will do anything in its power to assist you and your cousins.  We did it for Leo, of course, on countless occasions--
Damn right--had every potato eater from County Cork an the public tit--
But there's a way we do things, hallowed by usage and consecrated by time!  When we put people on the pad, when Leo was running things, we--
Leo ain't running things!  I ain't innarested in ancient history!  I'm running things now!
Johnny, no one appreciates that more than I!  I can give them jobs!  I can give them good jobs! I can even give them jobs where thev won't have to perform any work, where their lack of English will be no impediment!  But I cant--
What is this, the high hat?!
Tom, can you explain it to him?  I can put them in public works but I can't--
You can do whatever the hell Caspar tells you.  I don't remember all this double-talk when Leo gave you an order.
Tom!  Jesus!
Stop whimpering and do as you're told.
You can start by gettin' outta here.
But Johnny, it's my office!
Get outta here!  Take it on the heel and toe, before I whack you one!. . .
. . . Partiamo?
Yeah, go keep the mayor company.  I'll take care of ya's later.
What's the fireworks?
Knockin' over one of Leo's clubs.  Sonofabitch just won't go belly-up. . . I'm sorry, kid.  I heard about your little ride this morning.
Yeah, well sorry don't fix things.  We could just as easily've missed Bernie's corpse as stumbled over it, and I'd be dead now.
I know, I know.  But it don't mean Bluepoint's up to anything.  So he heard some rumor Bernie ain't dead, those stories pop up, people seen Dillinger in eight states last week.  So he hears a story, and he don't like you much anyway, so he decides to check it out--
Any stories about Bernie being alive, Bluepoint's made up himself.
Aw, you don't know that.  It don't even make sense--why would he?
. . . There could be a damn good reason. . .
. . . Maybe.  Okay, yeah, sure.  Tomorrow night, the fix is in.  What of it?
Bluepoint knows about it?
Yeah. . .
If Bluepoint's been selling you out on these fights, and means to again, he'll have to be able to point the finger at someone else--
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
--but with Bernie dead there ain't a hell of a lot of people he can point to.
Yeah.  Bluepoint sells me out.  Makes pretend Bernie's still doin' it.  Ats real pretty. Bernie leaked the fix, and you take the fall for supposedly not killing him. . . .
Nobody knows anybody.  Not that well.
Money don't mean that much to him.
Then it's not just money he's after.  He's got a wart on his fanny.
. . . Huh?
A wart.  On his fanny.  Giving him the fidgets. Maybe he's sick of sitting on the couch and maybe behind your desk don't look like a bad place to move to.  Maybe he figures the money can help move him there.
. . . Kid, you got a lip on ya.
Sure, talk to him.  Have a chat.  Ask him whether he's selling you out.  Don't take care of him before he makes his next move, just sit back and let him make it.  You're swimmin' in it.
Yeah.
. . . I'd worry a lot less if I thought you were worrying enough.
. . . But I am, kid. . . Christ. . . running things. . .
Yeah?
I got your message.
'Lo, Bernie, I had a dream about you the other day.
. . . Yeah?  A nightmare?
On the contrary; very sweet.  I dreamt you were lying out at Miller's Crossing with your face blown off.
. . . You get a kick out of that?
I was in stitches.  It's Mink, isn't it?
I came back and he wasn't happy to see me.  Can you beat that, Tom?  All he could taik about was how he had to skip, and how much trouble he'd be in if anyone found me at his place.
Some friend.
Yeah.  And you know what a nervous boy he was.  I figured, hell, you're a friend.  Maybe you could use some insurance.
That's you to the gills, Bernie: thoughtful.  You didn't happen to keep his gun, did you?
Held already ditched it.  Why?
. . . After Rug?
Yeah. . . How did you know?
Doesn't matter.  Listen, Bernie, I've been thinking about our little deal and I've decided you can stick it in your ear.
. . . Huh?
I figure you don't have anything on me that I don't have on you.  As a matter of fact, less, since I've decided to leave town. So I'm calling your bluff.
Wait a minute--
Shutup and let me talk.  I'm pulling out of here, tomorrow morning.  The only thing for you to decide is whether or not I leave behind a message for Caspar that you're still around.  If you want me to keep my mouth shut, it'll cost you some dough.
You can't--
I figure a thousand bucks is reasonable.  So I want two thousand.
In a pig's eye--
This isn't a debate, it's instructions.  I'm going out for a while; I'll be back here at four this morning.  Bring me the money.  If you're not at my place, four o'clock, with the dough, Caspar'll be looking for you tomorrow.
Got any money?
. . . No.
Okay.
. . . Yeah.
He likes you, Tom.  He said we didn't have to break anything.
Yeah.  Okay. . . Tell him no hard feelings.
Christ, Tom, he knows that.
. . . Take care now.
Tom Duchaisne.
Yes sir . . .
Swell.  Can you take this?
Kid, what's the rumpus?
I got news.
Yeah, news at this end too.  My stomach's been seazin' up on me.
Mink just told me that he--
You talked to Mink?!
Yeah, on the phone.  Bluepoint wants you to think he's dissappeared, so you can't talk to him, but he's been right here in town.
You're sure it was Mink?
See for yourself; he's coming to my place, four o'clock this morning.
Leo's holed up at Whiskey Nick's dump.
. . . How d'you know?
That ain't all we know, smart guy.
Is there a point?  Or are you just brushing up on your small talk?
I like that.  Cool under fire.  I'm impressed.
Is this how you taught Drop his story?
I like the way you think.  Maybe when you're dead I'll cut your head off, put it on my mantle--
Sonafabitch. . .
Johnny.  It's okay.  Bluepoint made him.  It's okay.  It's not important.
Then have him shut it!
. . . Johnny.  We can't double-cross him.  He wants to spill the whole set-up--
I've never let a sonofabitch walk!
You've never crossed anyone . . .
. . . Four o'clock, my place.  Mink's coming in on his own hook so I promised him the money. Don't make me out a liar--
. . . Lookit this, kid.
'Lo, Verna.  What's the rumpus.
I was just in the neighborhood, feeling a little daffy.  What're you doing?
. . . Walking.
Don't let on more than you have to.
In the rain.
Bernie's dead, isn't he?
. . . What makes you think that?
That's no answer.
I can't tell you anything yet.
Nobody cares, do they?  His friends didn't really like him.
He didn't like his friends.
You're a sonofabitch, Tom.  You're someone to talk.  You got me to tell you where he was and then you killed him.
Nothing for me.
Then why?
. . . Giving up Bernie was the only way I could see to straighten things out for Leo.
You said you didn't care about Leo.
I said we were through.  It's not the same thing.
I don't understand.  I don't care.  I don't care what reason you had or thought you had.
. . . He's still alive.
You expect me to  believe you?
. . . No.
That's you all over, Tom.  A lie and no heart.
. . . It isn't easy, is it Verna?
. . . I don't know how you did it.
Ya put the razor in cold water, not hot--'cause metal does what in cold?
I dunno, Johnny.
Okay, Johnny.
'Lo, Sal.  You can dangle.
'Lo, Tom.  You sure?  You don't look so hot.
I'm okay.  Go ahead, I'll drive him home.
Mr. Duchaisne. . .
Go down to the drugstore.  Call the police.
Yes, Mr. Duchaisne.
You better stay there til the officers arrive.
Yes . . .
. . . They'll be fine.
I get it.  You set me up.
. . . Anything to avoid a little dirty work yourself, huh?
I figured you'd come early, and be looking for blood.  He wouldn't, so you'd likely have the drop on him.
You're a sonofabitch, Tom.  I like the way you think.  You're right, the bonehead never knew what hit him.
Nothing in it for you, now.  With him dead we got nothing on each other.  Let me have the gun.
Why?
Pin this on Bluepoint.  Neither of us wants him walking around after this.
The cops'll be Leo's now.  They won't care what they hang Bluepoint for.
I guess that's so.  If you don't mind keeping the gun that killed Caspar.  And Mink.
I dunno, it was just a mix-up.  Here.
Mink thought Rug was tailing him?
Yeah yeah, you know Mink.  Hysterical.  Skin full of hop, head full of bogeymen.  Comes home crying one day, said he had to pop a guy, one of Bluepoint's spies.
Rug was following Verna, not Mink.  Mink just happened to be with her.
Yeah.  Funny, ain't it?  But you know, Mink was terrified Bluepoint'd find out me and him were jungled up together.
And I'll bet you'd kept him plenty worried about that, to keep him under your thumb.
Yeah, so what . . .
Why did Mink take Rug's hair?
Beats me, the kid was dizzy.  Fifty-fifty on the dough?  Or maybe I should get a little more, since I did the deed.
Bernie. . .
Huh?  Why not?
Bluepoint's already dead, halfway 'cross town.
What the hell are you talking about?
Bluepoint's dead.  It's gotta be you.  I mean hell, it's your gun.
What is this!  What the hell are you talking about! . . .
Not necessarily.
Are you crazy!  We're square!  You said it yourself!  We got nothing on each other!
Yup.
So what's in it for you?!  There's no angle!  You can't just shoot me, like that!
What heart.
. . . Tony?  Tom.  Tell Lazarre I've got his money. . . Yeah, all of it.  And I want to place a bet on tonight's fight. . .
They set you up downstairs?
How's that?
Hootch?  Whatever?
Yeah.  I happened to be near.
Actually. . . this might not be the best time. . .
. . . Who's he got in there?
O'Gar and the mayor.
I'll try again.
I'll tell him you stopped by.
'Lo, Verna.
See Leo?
He was busy.
You should see him.  He has something to tell you.
Maybe I'll run into him.
Bernie's funeral is tomorrow.  You could stop by.
Maybe.
. . . Leo has something to tell you.
So you said.
. . . Tell me something, Tom.  Why didn't you tell me what was going on?  I thought he was dead, and you never--
There was no point in telling you.  It could only have queered things if it had gotten out--
Jesus, Tom!  You don't just talk to people for the play it gives you or doesn't give you!  I suffered, you no-heart son of a bitch!
You know now.
What happened that night?
I went to a bar.  Passed out.  When I got back to my place they were both dead.
. . . Passed out, huh?
Yeah.
It's funny. . . I've never even seen you sleep-- though you told me once about a dream you had.
Maybe I lied.
You've never been straight with me about any- thing!  You are a sonofabitch!
Big turnout.
Drop dead.
. . . She's under a lot of strain.
Well, at least she didn't hit me.
Tommy, I'm glad you came. . .
She's taking the car.
Huh?
I guess we are.
. . . We're getting married.
. . . Congratulations, Leo.
The funny thing is. . . She asked me.  To tie the knot.  I guess you're not supposed to say that.
It doesn't matter.  Congratulations.
Thanks. . . Hell, Tom!  Why didn't you tell me what you were up to?!  I thought you'd really gone over--not that I didn't deserve it.  But you could have told me.
Telling you could only've queered things if it had. . .
I can see that.  Well.  It was a smart play, all around.  I guess you know I'm grateful.
No need.
I guess you picked that fight with me just to tuck yourself in with Caspar.
I dunno.  Do you always know why you do things, Leo?
Course I do.
You'll do fine.
. . . Jesus, Tom!  I'd give anything if you'd work for me again!  I know I've made some bonehead plays!  I know I can be pig-headed but, damnit, so can you!  I need your help, and things can be like they were, I know it!  I just know it!  As for you and Verna--well I understand, you're both young, and--well, damnit, Tom, I forgive you!
I didn't ask for that and I don't want it.
