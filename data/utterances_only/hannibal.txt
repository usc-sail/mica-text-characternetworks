It's hotter inside than it is outside... with the air conditioning.
Would you sign in here, please..?  You know, we're closing in half an...
I just came to drop off my payment....
...that'll just be a minute.
S'hotter inside than it is outside...even with the air conditioning. (SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH, THEN UP AT THE WALLCLOCK.)
You nervous...?
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
...what...?
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
Said what?
I'm an orphan.
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
That is a lovely thing to say.
Waal...
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
 What'd you say, hon...?
I said sometime it gets so...
Well, don't you worry, cause that baby's gone take care of that.
I wonder if you could just, sit down, talk with me a moment...
Cause, you know, I'm sitting here all alone.  Do you know what I mean?  Cause I feel it's getting late for me... do you know...?  That I've Waited Too Long...
 Waited too long, hon...?  
How's your child?
...what?
I said how's your baby...?
You want to hold him...?
Waal...
'bout time you learned...
...where's your friends...?
...you're here all by yourself, honey....
Give it up, Evelda.
Well, you know my name, honey, but I don't know yours...
Give it up.
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
Ain't this a picture, though, cause you know you ain't the first girl, ever got lef, in a position, waiting at the doctor's.  You can't trust men, child, don't you know that.... old as you are...?
Cause, see, they'll always let you down. Terrible thing, to do to an orphan...
....where were you...? 
 ...we, we didn't hear the go-ahead.
 Yeah, well, you didn't get it cause your radio went dead.  The backup plan was, 17.45, you guys are the Cavalry...
What happened to Right to Life?  What happened to right to my life...?  I'm in there, carrying the mail for all you drugstore cowboys, si'in in a van playin with each other's Velcro...  You wanna get up, you wanna get up? Here I am...
What happened to the girl...?
 Get me out of here...
And you let her get away.
Sir, with all due respect....
Just a moment.  Starling didn't...
Well, well, well, well, well, she went in there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, without the Felon, without the gun...
I had... one moment, I had an agent in there, waiting for backup from...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
Sir:
Shut up, Starling...
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
..I was instructed that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
You were given backup....
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the arrest must be a joint...
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's fine, but...
No, I don't get you...
Due respect, you don't, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet soup, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the fingers-- But-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
The Rainbow Coalition, what is that, excuse me...
And what are you, our Token Woman?
I don't mind being the token woman, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token man... who are these Warriors, our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
Starling...?
One moment, and they're at the Seven- Eleven.  They botched the fallback plan, they...
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are youdoing, this whole time?
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...
Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
 ....a compendium of the Bureau's most celebrated cases.  Which you have in your Course Study Guide.  Now;  This afternoon...
 ...how'd you let her get that close to you...?
...how'd she get next to you?
 ...she gave me her baby.
 She threw a punch at a man on the team.
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
What is that supposed to mean...?
I think its meaning is clear.
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
That could be.
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
One moment, I'm not done with you... (TO CRAWFORD, AS KRENDLER MOTIONS HIS AIDE TO HAND HIM A FILE) Give him the file...
I thought it was going to go down the line, to....
No, no, no, I want the girl to do it...
Of the apprehension of Hannibal Lechter.  Here we have a WANTED poster...
 Offered by an Unnamed Source, Three million Dollars for information leading to the apprehension of Hannibal Lechter. It is, of course, a bounty poster, the only one of its kind, it was never distributed, the contact number was disconnected, and the trail of the person offering the reward was covered so skillfully, that...
 (IN A CULTURED ATTRACTIVE ITALIAN ACCENT) ...would you be so kind...?
Yeah, sure.
 ....Of the Hannibal Lechter Case. Lechter is, as you know, still at large.  Here we see the implements used in his escape from Prison.  If you will turn to your course syllabus, Page....
....a lovely perfume...
Glad you like it.
 ....of Dr. Lechter's left hand.  His left hand, which had a sixth, vestigial, fully formed sixth finger.  You would think that a man with a mark so easily identifiable, would...
...and, speaking of the Lechter Case.
And, speaking of the Lechter case, I would like to complete our tour of the gallery with three other instances of Criminals Still At Large.  To complete our tour, and....  Oh, and to complete your Course of ..Study, by...
 Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver this... Getter off the street and teach her some humility. 
 I don't think so...
Well, then, you have insufficient information.  I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
 Yeah, get on to your sea-daddy, Starling.  Old as you are... ain't you ashamed, still lookin' for your Pappy...?
...what has he got against you?
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What is this...?
...what's he got against you?
  He once made me an improper suggestion.
Big man, little man... Fair fight, the good Big Man's gonna win.  But we don't mean to send you out there to fight fair...
And, in a gunfight, what just happened to the Big Man?  He's at a disadvantage. Inney?
Stand up. (THE MAN DOES SO, AND TAKES HIS PLACE ON THE MAT, IN FRONT OF BRIGHAM) Big man, now, he's just a bigger target. Let's turn it around.  Pull your sidearm. (THE YOUNG RECRUIT TAKES OUT A BRIGHT YELLOW, OBVIOUSLY RUBBER PISTOL FROM HIS HOLSTER)
 Now, an arrest?  You aim to shoot me, or you just playing show and tell.  You don't want to shoot me, you just deprived yourself of one of your hands.  You fool, I got two hands, you got one.  So: what's the gun good for?  Force?  No. It's good for control.  You can control through force, but you can also control through....
Misdirection.... (HE MOVES TO THE STUDENT AND THROWS HIM TO THE GROUND) Misdirection, My Friend.  You're pointing a gun at me, looking in the oth'direction, WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE...?
 ..that you went into police work to control your rage....
Well, that would be a poor choice, wouldn't it...
Tell me why...?
 I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
Then tell me.
Well, you know, you know, you know, the point is:  I can't tell you.  Cause you haven't been there.  You haven't done it. And that's all there is.
 ...and to have done it, means, can mean to accept, not only danger, but betrayal...?
....that's right.
..and humiliation?  What is this new job they've...?
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
I don't think so.
Then what brings you back?
I don't know.  Do you know...?
Yes.  I think I do. (PAUSE.  STARLING LOOKS AT HER, AS IF TO SAY, THEN, PLEASE, REVEAL IT) I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an orphan. (STARLING STARTS SHAKING HER HEAD) You used, to your mind, your most private fears.
...no...
...you called up memories of your father to...
...no...
...barter with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
No, I don't think so...
It is you who have betrayed...
...no.
Your father.  It is not they, who...
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your help, but... 
You want another drink, honey...?
I want the same drink.  Cause it did me good... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.
B'cause it's one of the few things, in the world, which are effective an'predictable.
What's that, Baby?
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities... (SOUND OF CHEERING, THEY LOOK TO THE SIDE) ...not unlike some Hindu God...
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
Well.  Excellent... I'm...
Semper Fi.
...truer words were never spoken...
Our Mister Frendler to, to, to humiliate me, though....
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Oh baby, oh baby....
Bad beat today.
Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?
Look what they put her on...
No, that is code-word material, that's what that is....
They got her cleaning out the privvies.
 What does this mean?
Slap her wrist, they got her, chasing down the auction houses, drawings of Mr.Lechter, come up for sale.
Why's she chasing'em down...?
Find out:  is he selling'em, he needs the money, o'r'izzey buying them, f'Old Times sake...
That's weak.  The man's long gone, he's not coming back, buy up a drawing...
No, but that is the Will of the Institution.  To instill a proper Probity, Humility, deference, in the prideful Individual.....COULD I, DOES ANYONE THINK, HAVE ANOTHER BEER...?
This Jackal Krendler, trine a shame her, cause they botched the raid.
Evelda Drumgo.
COULD I GET A DRINK,  N'I don't care, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' makework, than be doin' pub'l'relations with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one Hispanic, one Librarian, one Jew, and One from Column A, and One from Column... (A DRINK IS SET BEFORE HER, SHE REACHES FOR IT.  SHE LOOKS UP.) Thank you.
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
No, y'know, I never doubted it...
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
You should get Married.
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Yeah, but who would marry friendless me...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
 ...sadly...
Hey, lost again.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would kill you. 
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my respects to the great Clarice Starling... (HE BENDS OVER TO KISS HER HAND.)
The great and beautiful...
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
No,I get it, this is my Cavalier.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take this... (SHE REMOVES A SCARF FROM HER NECK AND HANDS IT TO HIM) For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
Thank you.
Or clear your windshield with it.
 ...what a lovely perfume.
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin home, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to take her there...
C'mon, pal.
All y'got to do is ask... (SHE REACHES FOR HER PURSE, AND KNOCKS THE FILE OFF OF THE TABLE)
...this one is my favorite.  It has not title.  They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
I know it well.
Do you.  What does that mean?
It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
Yeah, we got all sort of "funeray Sculpture," here, I guess they mean statues in Graveyards.  Brazil, the Tomb of Karl Marx, London, Here's one in Scandinavia...
Florence, as you may not know, is famed for...
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
...but:  this particular statue...
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
....this is perhaps an inappropriate time... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who solved the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
I din't solve it, I didn't 'solve it'.  I just sat a dance out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  Facts, close the case, cavalier.
...a case, so, so fascinating, so...
It was all of that, SON...
..what makes a man ... what makes him... Eat Human Flesh...?
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a cannibal...
Show'm the FBI Handshake...
I am no going to show you the secret handshake! 
 C'mon, pal, I'm gone to buy you a drink...
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the trick is...?
...not to turn around.
You want to get married...?
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
You're ready now.
I'm not.
That's what you think...
...mos kind...
Hey, now, what was I afraid of... I'm shooting at shadows...
Is that what you're afraid of...?
Then you tell me, then.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
I feel...  I feel they're Out to Get Me...
And who is "they?"
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
...the whole world's out to get you...
How crazy is that.
Well, you wanna shoot back, it give you a big target...
 How crazy is that....
Special Agent Clarice Starling, to see Mason Verger.
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
The children...?
...they're from Baltimore....
I've never heard that he...
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
I won't take much of his time.
He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand...
...y'get enough breakfast, Rosie...?
 Five minutes...
Aren't they beautiful, Miss Starling...
Well, now, you see, one of them's hurt. And what will make it better?  Love. Isn't that odd.  He think's he's hurt his knee--but the assurance, the assurance, the assurance that someone cares Suggests the hurt was elsewhere.
Mr. Verger, thank you for your time.
For the worst hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to capture him?  How terrible for you...
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
Because we must leave the past in the past.  Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
No, no.  That's alright.  Yes.  Lechter's drawings of me.  Before... and, of course, after... Now:  you are not sent to pursue him.  Then your visit baffles me.
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
Because?
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
Due respect, sir...
Due respect, after your, after your...
My encounter.
Someone offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was wrong. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know God? 
...sir...?
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows a Strength which must come from strong  But you shy when I say the name of God.
 ...I'm sorry.. 
Yes, then, you're saying that you haven't bid upon these drawings.
I have not, I would not.  For life life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to talk to you... I'm...   (TO THE NURSE, WHO IS TAKING STARLING'S ARM) One moment.  I was afflicted, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was afflicted before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: embrace it, and you embrace life.... Listen, and you hear the word of God...
...will he be alright...?
Mr. Verger wanted me to give you this... 
And he has asked me to ask you something.
What would that be?
 He... would consider it a favor if he could make a donation.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
Now, why in the world would he do that?
I... think... he was.... he was touched, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
What reaction?
Exactly.
 Please, I do not... I don't want to trouble him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
Do you know the seller?
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
Try Barney Clark.
 He is...?
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
And how would you know that?
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. (PAUSE.  STARLING MAKES A NOTE. SHE LOOKS AROUND.)
You should get the kids a dog...
....I hardly think so... after "The Incident"...
No, no, of course not.
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
...that you could ~go beyond the institution."
Yes.
What does that mean?
 I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
 If he could overcome... his need for... for self-ratification...
...would you use a small word?
For approval.
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
Yes.
How do you think that made him feel? (AFTER A PAUSE.  SHE CHECKS HER NOTES) What does that mean, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
...you are an orphan.
But... but....but.... you're right.  I used it.  To bargain.  For her sympathy...  I used it--to "whore myself out"-- 
Welcome to the human race. (STARLING SHAKES HER HEAD IN NEGATION.  PAUSE) Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you find them...?
Y'see John Brigham...?
...I...
Look at this:
You seen John Brigham...?
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
...what'm I looking at...?
A fellow with five fingers.
...standard issue...
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
Am I on that case, sir...? 
No. 
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a hobbyist...
Agent Brigham is in the Library.
 Excuse me... (THE AIDE AND CRAWFORD EXCHANGE A SURPRISED LOOK)
This isn't signed.
 Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda you care?  Surrender.
~Don't shoot, G-Men..."
Why?
 ...a monster fed his face to the dogs. (BEAT} N'he said that it saved his life.  He's spend'n his life helping Children. How corny is that...?  But, you know what:  I give up.  Let's get married and spoil a buncha Kids... 
Starling:  They got a x-ray.  They think, they might have a lead on Lechter.
Wherever he is, that's fine with me...
They...
Yeah, I know.
 They got a Radiologist Assistant, Buenos Aires, guy, amputation of a Sixth Finger...and it seems to've left a scar, uh oh....
That ain't my case.  They assigned me, go do some legwork, Theft of Government Property.  Tha's what I'm gonna do, and then go home and burn the roast.  How the hell about that--I'm gonna swim with the current, and I don't care where he is.
....is that the way for a Public Official to act?
 You represent Italy.  Call it an inspection...
Shouldn't that be carried out in Depth?
...I have to get back to my wife...
...what's up...?
How was America?
 Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
...nightmare.
What's up...?
 Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
Yeah, so where is he?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
They got that kind of money?
Their family owns...
Well, let's find him...
...buya lot of pasta for your wife.
She don't eat pasta, that's how come she's so slim.
Heresa file onnaguy, you got a meeting, the Palazzo Capponi, at four thirty.
I can't even go home and change...?
What'd you bring me...?
What else did I miss...?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
...are they hard to get?
Impossible.
 ...what a world.
What's the rush?  What's the rush...?
Aren't you glad to see me?
Tell me about your trip... what did you bring me...?
...and?
I brought you my passion and my wish that this afternoon will be for you an experience of ecstasy...
...what?
I can't think.
...you don't have to think.
We have to talk about money...
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
A reward...
I'm going to tell you later....
A reward for what?
Some museum director disappeared.
And?
They're offering... (AS HE MOVES HER TOWARD THE BED)
...you haven't found him yet.
What is this, a whorehouse, or are you my wife?
You've gone off to America, on your Vacation...
...I was working...
...please...
I swear to you...
...and I want to talk to you about your promotion..
Yes?  My promotion...?
I want to talk to you about your salary. Because I can't...
  I need you, y'understand, I need you...
 ...everybody needs something...
 Hold up a minute...
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
First things first.
You take this much time over everything?
That's why my wife adores me.
Carlo Fanelli, Dottore, missing two months.  He was the Director of the Museum.  Which, since his absence...
Ah, Pazzi.  How was America...?
We may need you to stop bloodshed.
What're they on about?
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
Dottore Fanelli...
He hasn't, by any chance, wandered back in?
Now:  our applicant holds in his hand, in his Non-Italian-Hand, a note, from Dante Aligheri himself.  Would he recognize it, I think not...
Indeed I do.  Because he is my Nephew? No.  Because he....
Yes, fine, of course he can read the note.  His Italian is admirable, for a straniero.  But is he familiar with...
 The personalities of pre-Renaissance Florence?  I think not.
 ...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
 Brazilian. 
It would seem.
 What if he came upon a note in, the Capponi Library, this great Italian Institution, which he now graces us with his bid to Direct, a note from Guido de Cavalcanti.  Would he recognize it, I think not.
 Would you care to address that, Dr. Fell...?
Cavalcanti replied publicly to Dante's first sonnet.  Do you know it, Professor Sogliato?  I believe it's worth your time:  Listen to the way he makes an instrument of the Italian vernacular, which he called the vulgari eloquentia-- the eloquent voice of the people: Allegro me sembrava amor tenedo/Meo core in mano, e ne la braccia avea/Madonna involta in un drappa dormedo/Poi la svegliava a d'esto ardeno/Lei paventosa umilmente pascea/Appreso gir lo ne vedea paingendo.  If Dante had written to a Cavalcanti, it would, of course, have been to Andrea, the most literary of his brothers....
...why do you want this job?
In the hope, that someday, I should come across such a note.  I thank you gentleman for your kind attention, and hope you will consider...
...investigating the disappearance of Dottore Fanelli...
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any enemies, that...
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
...he was wealthy...
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
...his family has offered a large reward.
His older brother offers the reward, Fanelli had nothing, he....
...will have, of course to be examined by the Studiolo, to confirm the appointment, but I think I can assure you, that the Committee...
...you are most kind...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  No one.  No one has but lost by it...
 ...would you excuse me...?
...will have to face the Studiolo, in their meeting next week.  And I, for one, wish you the best.
Dottore...
Pazzi, Rinaldo, Commendatore, Prefatura...
Of course, Commendatore...
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a note, a farewell note, a suicide note...
...yes.
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
Of course, in his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. (HE HESITATES, AND LOOKS AT PAZZI)
I'll have them picked up.
May we drop you?
Thank you, I am most happy to walk in this most magnificent of cities.
May I ask you a personal question, Dr. Fell?
If your duty requires it.
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? La Vita Nuova?-- 
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
Why did you look at me that way?
 I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but clean.  Just dressed--in the middle of the...
...please...
 I saw a man, somewhat fatigued. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day.  An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was fresh--therefore:  a man who dressed at home.  And then I remarked the new wedding ring.  And so:  the story gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved wife.  I wish you joy. 
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
 I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
...your scar..?
My scar is a war-wound.
How so?
Carpal-tunnel syndrome.  From a life of typing.  Commendatore.  History, a hazardous profession.
You are a Pazzi of the Pazzim are you not?
Yes.  How did you know?
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
I have had the honor. (HE BOWS AND STARTS OFF. PAZZI GOES AFTER HIM.)
I wondered that an officer of your exalted rank should come, so late, into the case.
And?  Then?
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
How could you know?
I sense...  The faintest whiff of a perfume, whose base, whose base, whose base is "Hamamelis" ... it is witch-hazel--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
You know America?
...you have brought this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  Back from America.  To your New Wife... (HE PICKS UP HIS HAND, AND GLANCES DOWN AT PAZZI'S WEDDING RING.) You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
Should you come across anything which...
You will be the first I call.
Are you attracted by Death?  It is the one great mystery, is it not? Anyone who would say otherwise must be a hypocrite.  Don't you think...?
...or are you only attracted by power...  How are you, Agent Starling?
Ah, Barney:  you've got a good mernory.
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
I have not read you your rights.
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
 Then why did you chose to inform me of it...?
To show...  in my ability to squander.  What one might deem an advantage... that my strength is greater than yours...
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
You almost took down Evelda Drumgo.
Well.  Word gets around.
...what hindered you...?
It wasn't my day.
Perhaps you did not have the support you required.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
Or, perhaps...
...how are things at the Hospital?
It's a growth business.
What have they got you doing?
Orderly.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
 You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Yes, I presumed it was about him.
...you...
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not last with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
 I'm looking for...
He said, and these were his words, he valued our time together, because I was civil.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after you...?
 What...?
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
We got a bunch of materials, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his books.
Yes?
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Why me?
Waal, because your selling'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
...very good.
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
...why?
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
You said "here's what they want you to do..."  Why?
Now, whyn't you help us?
That would adversely impact my income.
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
We could skip the Gavotte.
Say it in English.
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
Then who's buying it?
 There's one or two freaks, and, for a "Pass," I'll rat them out to you... (HE TAKES A PENCIL, AND PUTS A COUPLE OF NAMES IN HER BOOK, LEANING OVER HER)
That's the spirit...
...aren't you afraid of me...?
You want me to be?
I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
A vacant exercise, why...?
You said "here's what they want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or what?  Have you transgressed...?
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
...they did it for a lark.
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
Off you go.  You've grieved enough. Anything more would be self-indulgence.
 Who are these guys...?
Rich, comic book freaks.
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Who would that be.
 Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can you be free....?
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
 And have you found Peace..? 
What'll you do with the bird...?
Pluck it, and eat it.  It was so good to see you..
How you doin?
M'I gonna see you tonight?
That's right.
Then I'm doing fine.
What's new onna street?
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
Can we run this guy down?
Who is he?
His job description?  He's a comic book freak.
Whadda we want him for...?
Insufficient Animation.  Just get me his vital signs, will you...?  Catcha later... 
Which would, of necessity, have left this scar in the shape of the number "3."
Why a Three?
It requires two flaps to close the area between the...
Starling:  come look at this:  did you see this?
Yes sir, I saw it. (HE HANDS HER A COPY OF THE X- RAY.)
 We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
I am all attention.
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
Just the person I'm looking for.
And why would that be...?
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
You're going to do that?
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. (OF THE X-RAY.  SHE HOLDS IT UP, SEEKING INFORMATION)
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
 You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your mind cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step slow...
I don't wanna go out there at all...
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
What broke you free, Girl?
I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...
"...and age-appropriate large and small motor skills.  His unfortunate home situation has made it necessary for Franklin to form immediate attachments with adults, which we understand to have contributed to many instances of his abuse."
Are you Franklin ?
...Franklin.
Where do you live?
With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.
But Stringbean, he in and out.
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
She my foster.
She's not the first foster that you've had.  Is she?
No. (THE CHILD LOOKS AROUND, AND, FINDING NO SUPPORT, LOOKS BACK AT VERGER.)
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
 We got KittyKat...
Yes.... yes...
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
...who say...?
The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the Government says...
...or perhaps they just don't want you anymore.  Could that be?  And, do you know what will happen to Kitty Cat?  When you go away.  The police will take her, and they'll give her a shot.  With a shiny needle.  They'll give Kitty Cat a shot.  And it will hurt her.  And then she will die.
Come here... (BEAT. FRANKLIN COMES FORWARD, HIS FACE SCREWING UP IN TERROR AS THE DETAIL OF VERGER BECOME MORE APPARENT.  HE STOPS MOVING FORWARD.) Do you know how you keep kittycat from getting a shot?  Franklin?  No?  Do you know.  Then come here...
You can keep Kitty Cat from getting a shot if...
If you give him this...
You can keep her from getting the shot, if you give her that rat poison yourself...
Goodbye, Franklin.
...remember what we talked about.
 No, I'm fine...
..what have we heard from our friend at the FBI...?
Most current information shows the result of an operation for the removal of a sixth digit, the left hand of a man.
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
Not with any certainty we...
Why did he come back?
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
...are you alright, sir...?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
Seen what, sir..?
The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why? Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As Lechter will return back.  You see?  To the sight of his oppressor wounded. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling.  Bring me a drink.
Your drink, sir.
It's time to step up the pressure on our Sweet Miss Starling.  ...call our friend at the F.B.I.  And, instead of finding Lechter, let's help Him find us.
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are expensive...
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
Fine, thank you, but
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
...whatever is within my power...
...and that is what you need to expand.
I don't understand.
 We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
...why are we here in the first place...?
Because it is exclusive... because everyone will be here...
Mrs. Demetrio, how good to see you...
You see, that is my point.
...my love...
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot return the...
I am on the track of...
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, if you get it, will not buy me a new watch... 
...what do you expect me to...
So, the question:  as always, Rinaldo, the question is one of mmm...
Commendatore would you do me the honor of introducing me.
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
 Enchante.
The exhibit is closing.  The exhibit is closing in Ten Minutes... please make your way to the...
Dr. Fell.  You are not Italian.
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
But the exhibit is closing.
How unfortunate.
May I...?
What a lovely perfume.  I believe I recognize it, do I not...?
My husband brought it to me from America.
A wonderful country...
You know it?
I have had many excellent meals there.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
 ...should love to correct your error. 
Well, perhaps sometime we...
Darling...
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
The commissioner is going round the Cafe...
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
Then we cannot go.
Because...?
Because we cannot pay...
...constant humiliation.  And why?
"Because we don't have any money."
....because we don't have any mmm...
The Case that I am working on...
It's a joke.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money is-- your idea of money... (SHE PICKS UP ANOTHER FILE ON THE DESK, AND TAKES OUT THE SCARF GIVEN TO PAZZI BY STARLING) ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
And if you do not find some money. Soon.  I'm leaving you.  And I want tickets to the Opera.
What was it.  What was it, honey?
...something about my father...?
...what?
 Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
 Show me the pigs.
Good morning, Gentlemen.
...may we see it, please?
 We have them trained the two things:  to come on the whistle, and to attack the figurine.
...can you see the pig...?
We stuff the figure with mean scraps, at first, of course, the pigs is...
Do it...
...Let's see the pigs, please.
We tape the screams, to get them used to the (HE MUMBLES, LOOKS TO HIS FRIEND FOR HELP)
...distraction.
...as you recommend,  I think they like it.  They will eventually.
Make them eat the figurine.
They will, sir.  We train them, to the figurine, eventually, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
 ...tell them...
We don't want the man consumed.  No.  We want to put the man's feet through the bars, and have the pigs... and have the pigs eat his feet.
 ...they eat his feet...
Yes.  It's all a question of bait--isn't it...?
...make them eat the dummy.
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the man... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
Is it necessary to know?
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
Oh, no, no.  It won't be that long.
No, I don't think it will be too very long at all.  Please call our friend at the FBI.
 Hello.  Do you know who this is?  I think it's time to finish the preparation of our friend.  Miss Starling.  I'm fine, how are you...?
...to, to... to be in control of my... my emotions.
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today... 
 I don't understand.
You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
That's right.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
Yes.
And you've decided to get married.  You've decided a lot of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  despair, of failure of... you still have the nightmare, you...
What is your point?
That if decision were a useful tool, you wouldn't be here.  Why are you here...?
I..
...yes...?
 I want to do something positive...
You want some advice.
Yes.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, accept it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
...why?
Because it's the game you've chosen. That's really all we have time for.
...a liaison position...
And what does that mean?
...I feel that...
"A liaison position with the Opera." 
Rinaldo, what happened to you?  You want me to reach out for tickets to the Opera.  Say so.  What is that young girl doing to you...?
Could you get me tickets to the Opera.
She must be something special After Dark.
I can't remember. (PAUSE.  THE SUPERIOR NODS SAGELY) I've got to make some money.
 Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
...yes, yes, yes....
Could you help me with tickets to..
The short term problem is the tickets-- The long-term problem is your wife.
Naldo, you want Opera Tickets...?
Can you help me?
No, but I'm going.  If you like, I'll tell you what you missed.
And the related problem is your job. Aha.  And here it all comes together.  To get a promotion you must keep your job.  To keep your job you must solve this case.  Solve the case, and the reward may help you keep your wife.  In short, the solution to all your problems lies in This File:  The Disappearance of Il Dottore Fanelli.
Commendatore, if you're looking for Opera Tickets....
 Hello....?
I know where he is.
I know where he is.
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
I want the money.
The shape of a Three.
 ...on positive identification.  And the remainder of the Reward, upon his apprehension by the appropriate Legal Authorities. 
Where was the call from.
Somewhere in Italy.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
That operation has begun.  Are we God, that we would Meddle with it...?  No, on the other hand...
How can she sleep at a time like this? How can she...
...sleep at a time like this...?
 She's resting.  She's conserving her strength, perhaps you should do the same.
Stand by.
...Starling...
Yeah, it looks clear outside the... wait a moment..... we got... it's a gunship...
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A. (HE NODS TO ONE OF THE MEN IN THE VAN.) We want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
I know her by the Back.
...these guy'll back you up.
We're gonna be your Couch Potatoes.
Pray that it may be so.  She will fight. Last time, she had a nine mil, three magazines, mace in her purse, a Razor round her neck, and a shank in her hair.  She will walk over you, you give her a chance.  I'm gonna asker to give it up, she balks, I want some real help. Nevermind Watching my Back, I want some weight on her.
You got it.
We've got some action, coming out of the building.
I don't want you Huskies stand'n around, watching us Mud Wrestling.... Drurngo is HIV positive, and I don't wanna be in there, swap spit with her...
I've got you, three hundred yards from the Factory.  We're going in the back door.
...how we looking back there?
Heads up!
 Strike one to all units;  Evelda Drumgo's coming out behind two shooters. Showdown Showdown Showdown.  Put em on the ground, as quietly as we can. Boat's due in thirty seconds, let's do it.
...make sure you...
 Wait Wait Wait!
Evelda!  Give it up!  Come to me, Baby! (OUT OF THE SIDE OF HER MOUTH, TO THE MEN BEHIND HER.) ...give her a place to go... give her a place to go.... Come on Evelda.  Nothing to it.  I swear to god.
Ev...
 SECURITY SECURITY!  WATCH THE FISH HOUSE DOOR BEHIND ME.  GET MY BACK.  Evelda. Evelda.  Put your hands out of the window.
Evelda.  Show me your hands.  Come on. Please.  Show me your hands.
Well, it's you, chile.  It's my friend the orphan...
Give it up, Evelda.
You said you din' have no friends--but I'm your friend--  I understand you....
Think about the baby... show me your hands.... Evelda?  Show me your hands...
F'that's the thing to do...
I...
What, What, I can't hear you...
Are you alright...?
I almost shot the baby...
Who called the TV CREWS...?
Sergeant...
Security!!!
 They're dead... standdown, it's alr...
 ...you forgot to cancel the plan.
...sir...?
Waal, Nobody's Perfect... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
One hundred thousand dollars, Signori. The remainder of the three million.  Upon the person-in-question's apprehension.  Would you prefer a cheque...?
No, no thank you, I...
...and the Remainder, you said. ..?
After you have, in the words of our friends, the Americans, Put him On the Spot.
But is that necessary...
 It is necessary, if you wish the remainder of the money. (HE NODS TO HIS CLERK, WHO CLOSES THE DOOR ON THE VAULT) Shall we drive you to the airport...?
 I...I thought I'd do some shopping...
 ...how can I thank you?
Ask me when we get home.
Oh, my program...
Ah, Commendatore... you, too, admire Mozart.
 Who does not?
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could unearth him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
I've left my program...
Take mine. (HE HANDS HIS PROGRAM TO PAZZI, AND THEY START UP THE AISLE) Ah. And is that your wife... (THEY GAIN THE SIDE OF MME. PAZZI.) Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
Then, she, herself, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
Commendatore, your wife tells me you are taking her away on Vacation.
...long overdue.
 When first we met you'd just returned from America.
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your busy mind...
...how so?
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the Studiolo...
And how good of you to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to America...
No, this is pleasure...
And what was the trip before...?
That, that was business...
Business.  Yes.  How much better.  To travel for the Pure Enjoyment of the thing, of the variety of the world....yes...  Just to Get Away.  I'm surprised they can spare you, in the midst of your investigation.  of the disappearance of my predecessor...
 Take me home and make love to me...
 Time to get something to eat...
 Yes, quite...
I beg your pardon.
You suggested it was time to get something good to eat.
I thought that you were... (HE SEES ANOTHER MAN APPROACHING HIM) Ah!  Where shall we eat...? 
 ...where shall we eat.  And what shall we eat.
...Laura...Laura...Laura...
...and then, we're going to Greece...
Yes, but the important thing, as I've said...
...get me a cigarette.
The essential thing.  The essential thing, is that we must be absolutely quiet about...
...what is it?
...you've forgotten the cigarettes.
I came to pay my...
...get outta my way, you sonofabitch...
I realize, you're under a lot of....
You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse TaskForce...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
 Izzat the kind of publicity will aid Our Run for Congress?  You swine, you...
 You're out she's out...
 You country Cornpone BITCH--hey, you Trailer Trash BITCH, you still looking for your Daddy, Beat you up, to show he Loves you?
 Looking for your Daddy, fuck you and mark you up, an...
Well, here I am, you...
Quod videt monumentum, circumspice. Need I translate?
If you would see him monument, look around you.
Show me the Pigs.
Telephone call.  From Switzerland, sir.
I hit him with the beanbag gun, you stand by:  he's still flopping...
Just make sure he's alive, because I've already spent the bonus...
 Della vigna was disgraced and blinded for his betrayal of his emperor's trust- -through avarice.  Avarice and hanging  are linked in the ancient and the madeadeval mind.
Judas and Pier Della Vigna are linked in Dante by the avarice he saw in them, and their subsequent deaths by hanging.  Ah Commendatore Pazzi...
You are welcome.  Since you are closest to the door, would you close the door, to improve the quality of the image.  You will be interested in this, Commandatore, as there are two Pazzi's already in Dante's inferno...
 Camicion de Pazzi, as you know, murdered a kinsman, and rests in hell awaiting the arrival of a Second Pazzi.  But it's not you:  it's Carlino, who will rest forever in hell for the crime of Treachery.
 On the next occasion, you might like to discuss the matter of Chewing.  Chewing in Dante:  Count Ugolino, chewing the back of the archbishop's head--Satan, with his three Faces, chewing Judas, Brutus, and Cassius... all three traitors.  Is it not?  Thank you all for your kind attention.
Would you say that I've preserved my job, Commendatore?
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?
I require...
...yes, yes, yes...
...the effects of my predecessor.
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
Yes, of course, and we'll collect them. I won't be a minute...
Ah, no.  I should have shown them this one.. (HE TAKES OUT A SLIDE AND PUTS IT IN THE PROJECTOR) This one will interest you:  let me see if I can improve the focus...
Can you make it out, can you make out the name on the plaque?
 It says Pazzi.  Pazzi.  And a rude, a very rude poem, this is your ancestor. Francesco, hanging outside the Palazzio Vecchio.  Outside These Very Windows.
On a related subject Signor Pazzi, I must confess to you:  I'm giving serious thought to eating your wife.
Yes.  Your Wife.  Laura.  L'Orange, which is the topnote of her skin, wouldn't you say?  Or do I grow too personal?  but that is what I think of, when I think of her.  And how could I but think of her? I haven't had a bit all day.  The kidney and the liver would be su1table for a dinner tonight.  But the rest of the meat should hang for a week, in these cool conditions.  Wouldn't you say?  Nod once for yes.  If you tell me what I need to know, then it would be convenient for me to leave without my meal.  And Mrs. Pazzi will remain unscathed.  I'll out the questions to you, and we'll see:  I saw at the theatre you had betrayed me. And, when the police didn't come, it was clear you had sold me out.  Was it to Mason Verger?  Blink one for yes.
Thank you.  And now:  Are his hit men waiting outside?  Was that a single blink?  Yes.  Thank you.
No, no.  I'm going to take the tape off. Please do not scream.  Do you think you can keep from screaming?  ...would it help if I were to cut your BOWELS OUT...?
...cover the backdoor.  If he comes out, Kill him.
...the bonus was for...
Kill him, and cut him.
Young man...
Young man, I am desperate.  If I am not at the Piazza Bellosguardo in ten minutes, it is the end of marriage. (HE HANDS A BUNDLE OF NOTES TOWARD THE BOY) Do you think you could help me....?
...how do you like it?
It's real funny.
Tell me the good news.
He escaped...
Have the child taken to bed.
I wanna see more...
What do you want me to do?
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
And I brought this for you...
What is it?
Out of John Brigharn's Locker...
Waal...
I know you did what you could.
I'm going to work for your reinstatement...
Reinstatement to what?  There ain't nobody there...
Starling, Agent Starling:  what do you have to say to the New Accusations...?
New...?
You've been accused of...
...leaking information to the Press, which resulted in the botched...
Agent Starling:  what was your reaction to your indictment...?
...indictment...?
The district attorney today...
Majorca, Greece.... oh, Aaand Turkey.... Mr. Bates, you're treating yourself to a Holiday you'll remember for...
Of the American FBI agent, Clarice Starling, shown here, in her dramatic gun battle, last week, with...
Mr. Bates...?  Mr. Bates...?
Dismissed from the FBI, she, it seems, is under criminal indictment for...
Could I, do you believe, change my Destination...?
Well...well...what did you have in mind...?
 ...criminal indictment.... in quite a surprising move, against agent, that is, Former Agent...
...it's the F.B.I.
Yes.  Good.  No.  He will come.  He will come.  Do not let up on our Angel Starling.  No.  Now you must keep a constant watch on her.  Use your toys--A transmitter in her car, a.... keep her in your sight...  Do not let up, and he will come back for the wounded bird.  He will find a way.
Let go, let go, let go.
What are you doing to my son?  Let him go!
He's...what is he doing to my SON?
I beg your pardon, Madame, I was replacing his...
 I was trying...
...he was trying not to wake him.
I beg your pardon, if I caused you any Consternation.
...would you like some...?
 And it's important, as I'm sure she's said, to Eat New Things!
 so important...
...be easier if we just kill him.
Be easier on everyone but us...
 It's going to be long...?
Is going to be much longer, we should feed them...
Mmm.  Is it going to work?
The problem, if it is:  the tape is not the true scream, an' the dummy, of course, is not the true man.  BUT.  Yes, yes, I think, is close enough....
So:  the two problems are:  they should be fed, and they should practice on a real...
Yes.  You could say, that the two, the two prob...
 Sad day.
...what...?
N'not that sad.
Problem with suicide, y'know what they say?
No.
Every suicide kills two.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Trouble is, they all seem to die.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Don't shoot yourself.
Why?
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
Gimme the rounds...
Whyn'tcha go see that Headshrinker nobody knows you're seeing...?  N'you make her earn her keep...
(EXITING.} ...you brush your hair first...
(CHECKING HER NOTES} ...the dream of your Father.
Well, you're a courageous woman.  Have courage, and tell me.
He was shot...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
And all he left us:  the Country brought back his hat, and his badge... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.
And you have been dreaming... dreaming about this Hat, and...
 And.  I always said, he was a P'lice officer.
...yes...?
But.  He was a night watchman.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his badge, an his timeclock.  N'then they took me off.  I saw... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a delusion?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
When?
But they were not there.  Yesterday.  Is that called a Delusion...?
B'cause, you know, whatever it is, I can't take it anymore...
 I'm sorry.  I'll have to take this in the other room.
Not too far from a complete breakdown. Well, several things would--you've done the Badge, I suggest...
...got her staked out.  Yeah, she's still in with the...
I said:  she's still in with the...
 One moment...
...who paid you... who...
FBI where's your phone...?
 Mapp.  Get me Ardelia Mapp.  Well.  Get in touch with her.  Tell her...
Tell her that....
..this is Clarice Starling..  ...this is not a personal message...I...  I...
 Yaaasss...
Yaas.  Turn the page, please....?
..and how is our prize...?
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
 Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
 But you will recall what the last time we met, you drugged me, and induced me, in that state, to scrape my face off and FEED IT TO THE DOGS.  DID THAT DIVERT YOU?  TELL HIM WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO RECIPROCATE!!!
...the bad news is:  we're going to stick your feet through those bars tomorrow, and feed them to our pigs.
 Thank you, Cordell.
 ...but will that satisfy you?
Why should you care?
It is not that I care for you--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you do when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
ARE YOU DONE?
 Yes.
You don't wish to beg...?
Would that add to your mirth?
Explain in depth the plan we have for him.  Until tomorrow.
One would have thought he'd keep me under observation.  To savor his triumph.
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
...young boys, still...?
...here's to child abuse!
Mmm...
...and then, he'll be coming down.
You said the bad news...
Yes, I did.
I believe that your tone implied that there was some good news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for you...
Oh, yes, what?  You'd bribe me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
I can make you rich.
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men (HE PRODUCES A SMALL CASE, WHICH HOLDS TWO HYPODERMICS)
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a spinal, tomorrow, you wuunt feel anything down there, a l'il pulling is all.  N'I'll tell you what, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta this (HE TAKES A VIAL FROM HIS POCKET) stop your heart, an that's you done, an there's an end to it.  What do you say...? (CORDELL REMOVES A CELLPHONE FROM HIS POCKET) I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it around...  ...stay with me now, fuss with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a code... move that money to me, he confirms it, and I fix you up Right Now... (HE HOLDS UP THE SYRINGE AND SQUIRTS IT) Whatsay?
 ..suitcase...locker...
Come on, Doctor, then you can sleep...
 ...unmarked hundreds....
....what...? (HE LEANS FORWARD.  FROM THE BACK WE SEE LECHTER'S HEAD COME UP AND MOVE TO BIT CORDELL)
...you wan me to shoot im?
That's the last think I want...  Our other option is to beat you for a while, with this axe handle, here.  I suppose this is what it feels like.
Oh yes. Oh, yes, come here... Come here...Up Lad, When the Journey's Over, they'll be time enough for Sleep...
Yes.  Come here.  For what good is Television, Educational as it may be, if it is not also entertaining.....come-- have some popcorn...
 Make it last, make it last, for godsake, make it last....don't "hurt" him...!
Mr. Verger...?
I'm awake.  Oh.  Is it Time!
Oh, yes, one waits so long, and then, and then ...ALMOST BY MAGIC...Yes, proceed. Please.... proceed...
..It won't be long now, sir...
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
 On the ground, on the ground...
Good morning, Clarice.
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?
Perhaps... shall we see...?
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
Spoken like a Protestant.
I'll do the rest, if you give me the knife.
No, I don't think so.
 I'm going to subdue our friends, coming down the hill, and I want you to cuff em, and to put em inside with the other fella... My car is 
Other fellow?  There should have been two of them...?
What's happening, would you please...?
Stop there, would you, please, Doctor...?
The girl could use some help.
You're free...
...which of us is free...?
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the only crime.  I never ceased to hope!
The girl needs help.
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU THINK?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE HIM AND HER FOR THE PIGS! (CORDELL, HOLDING A GUN, ADVANCES ON LECHTER)
...might I make a suggestion...?
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the word...
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Let the girl go.
Why?
For a consideration.
'fraid it's too late.
...when I... 
...what has she done to harm you...?
Yes, do you know, you're right...  ...Mr. Verger...?  Mr. Verger, Sir?  He's ready... 
Hey, Franklin.  Hey.  Tell you what, if you'd just stop doing that, I'm going to give you something nice.
He don't like popcorn.
No.  And...
I like Popcorn...
...yes, if you'll, just step away...
You give me whatever I want...?
Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.
Awright.
You know what I want...?
I WANT KITTYKAT!!!
Let me down, son, let me down.
What'll you do for me?
I'll take you home.
Ain't got no home.
Then what would you like...?
 Yes.  You shall have it...
Then you goin to hell...
...that's right...
You look lovely.
Thank you. (SHE MOVES TO SIT, AND LECHTER COMES UP AND HOLDS HER CHAIR FOR HER) No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you find me so..."
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
What is that that smells so wonderful.
I hope you'll find it so. (HE POURS HER A GLASS OF WINE) Yes.  It's good to see you regaining your strength...
Thanks to you...
Now, what were we last speaking of...?
We were speaking of my father...
...I'm sorry....?
...we were speaking of my father...
Indeed we were.
...and my need for The Institution...
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
And how did he do that?
He saw the truth, and spoke it...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
...you have to eat...
 You've sought out The Institution all your life, as you with it to replace your Father.  This is obvious.  Less obvious is this:  that you require the institution not to support you, but to FAIL.  FOR THIS KEEPS YOUR FATHER ALIVE.
...as this keeps your father alive.  The truth is two-fold, and the truth is one:
 That every man is fallible, that every institution, being made of men, cannot but be corrupt...
...the only art in this dish, of course, is that it must be fresh...
That the institution cannot but be corrupt, and, therefore, it cannot be but an act of complicity to seek to appease it.
So many civilizations eat their slain enemies... what do you think...?  How much better to devour a person physically, than to devour his spirit. Which is, of course, the purpose of the institution.
 :and that is the especial surprise, I've prepared for You!
I feel weak...
 ...you must eat.
...1 don't understand...
 The gift, of course is not the meal-- but the identification--which of us does not need help?  The identity, of your true enemy...? ...for you always sought to befriend, to wish the love of those who wished you ill.
Come here--he is in no pain, there are no nerves in the brain, come here...
Come here, I'm going to cure you.
Oh, no.  Oh, NO.  They've put a beeper on you.  How careless of me.  How finally careless, Do you think?  Have I erred on Purpose?  Eh?  Or am I just unlucky? Could one not say that's the essential question of Philosophy...?
Might I have some more of the wine...?
Because, I find I like the effects.  You may say that it's inebriation, but it seems  This lovely evening, in particular.... it seems to reward me with clarity... 
....or perhaps, it is just the heat... I was just saying to the Doctor... 
But, do you know, do you know, I'm not feeling altogether....
...I've got her...
 ...may be the heat....
Let's get her out of here....
But as my father used to say...
 ...ohmiGod.
That's why it's a stone, you know, It means Don't Come Back.
Well.  No.  He can't come back.
Baby, that's the beginning of wisdom.
 Give me your gun...
...what...?
...what, what did you say...?
