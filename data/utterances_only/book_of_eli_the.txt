Dear Lord, thank you for your generosity in providing us today with this bountiful feast.
Thank you for the many gifts that you have given me. Thank you for your protection and your guidance. Thank you for bringing me this far. I know my long journey's end is near. I ask now only for the strength and the courage to complete the task that you in your infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow upon me over all men. I won't let you down. Amen.
Hey. You hungry?
Come on now.
Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here, take anything you want. You want some food? Take it.
I'm not going to hurt you.
That's what the last guys said.
Here.
Could you help me? The wheel came off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I could get it out of the ditch. But I can't.
One good thing about no soap any more. You can smell the road agents a mile off.
Dumb bitch. What did we tell you?
What you got there in the pack?
Nothing.
Yeah, that's what they all say. How about you take it off real slow and tip it out so's we can take a look?
He's got a gun.
Shit, it ain't loaded. They never are. Ain't that right, old man?  Open the fucking pack or die.
I can't do that.
Want us to do it for you? We can get it off real easy after we've hacked your fucking arms off.
It's real important you boys listen to me and understand. The man I work for, you do not want to cross him. See, I'm under his protection. You stand in my way, you stand in his. And he will cut you down with a righteous fury - through me. For I am his faithful instrument.
What the hell are you, some kinda preacher?
Something like that.
Well I got news for you, preacher man. Whatever kinda God you reckon yourself to be working for, he left these parts a long time ago. He ain't here to protect your ass. Now take off the pack and set it on the ground.
You fucking listening to me?
I hear you. You lay that hand on me again and you will not get it back.
All right, I had just about enough of this shit...
What... you just... he just cut my fucking hand off! My fucking hand!
What you standin' around for? Kiss him!
What's he talkin' about, kiss him?
He's in shock. He means "kill him".
I told you you wouldn't be getting that back.
Who are you?
My name is Eli.
Take it and go on your way. And don't fall in with men like these again. No good can come.
Why are you doing this?
God, the father of mercies, through the death and resurrection of his son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the holy spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins.
Through the ministry of the church may he give you pardon and peace, and I absolve you from your sins in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit. Amen.
Thank you. You're... a good man.
There are no good men on the road.
Where are you going?
West.
Can... can I come with you?
No.
It ain't your concern. Stay on the path. It ain't your concern. Stay on the path.
You got an engineer or a fuelman around here?
Thanks.
I don't know you.
I'm not from around here.
No shit. Who are you?
I'm just a customer.
A customer with a shotgun?
You come in here to rip me off?
No. I'll set it down. Okay?
Slowly!
You carry a gun in the outland, you don't bring one into town less you live there. Don't you know that?
I'm sorry, I forgot. I've been on the road a long time.
Show me your hand.
I'm not a-
I said show me your fucking hand!
I'm not one of them.
What do you want?
I'm just passing through. I need some help. I can pay.
What kinda help? And what kinda pay?
I'm going to get something out of my pack. Okay?
I know, I know. Slowly.
Holy shit.
Where'd you find this?
Years ago, in the outland back east aways.
Does it work?
Yeah, it just needs a charge. Can you do it? I got the cables.
Depends if you also got the coin.
It'll take a couple hours. There's a bar across the street you can wait, they just opened up.
I'll wait here.
You don't trust me?
 I don't know you.
What is it?
Survey team just finished up their inspection. It ain't good.
How bad is it?
Pressure is down again, and going by the new rod they sank levels're lower than they've ever been.
How long?
Hard to say. Six months, maybe. A little longer if we're careful. But we're already-
Halve the rations.
We just halved `em last-
So halve them again!
You're going to have to say something. Folks were none too happy last time. Gonna be worse now, you can count on it.
I want you all to remember how far we've come together. And how far we still can go, if only we believe. When I brought us here to this oasis - this promised land - we knew there would be hardships. Knew there would be sacrifices. But we also knew that we were creating for ourselves a world where we could be safe from the horrors of the forsaken lands beyond our borders.
And I want you all to remember above all that it is not the water with which we have been blessed that is the true lifeblood of this town... but faith.
It is our faith that sustains us, brothers and sisters! Hallelujah!
And mark me, the ultimate validation of that faith is coming! The sacred Word of Our Lord that formed the world before and will reform it once again is coming to this town to bring it succor, bring it nourishment, bring it new life! For the Almighty Himself has spoken unto me and promised it!
In the meantime, He has asked us all to be patient. To walk the hard road of the faithful just a little longer. And to do that, we must give just a little more.  Water rations will be halved until further notice.
I understand your frustration. The road to salvation is a difficult one - but what lies at the end of that road is a greater glory, beyond anything you can imagine.
We've heard this all before! When are you going to-
I know each and every one of you will understand the necessity of this action. It was faith that built this town - and faith that will sustain it even through the dark times that may lie ahead. But it is always darkest before dawn - and the new dawn is coming.  May God go with you all.
One of the road crews just rolled into town.
Of course they did, the bar's open. Outlanders, always looking for answers at the bottom of a bottle.
Not these guys.  These guys say they got something.
Get them up here now.
Gentlemen! It's truly a delight to see you again! I understand your latest excursion into the outland has been a profitable one?
We did good.
Well, let's see, shall we?
No. No. No. No. No.
It's not here.
These ain't worth nothin'?
When you bring me the book I asked you for, it'll be worth something.
We been doin' this a long time now. Had to make a whole lotta corpses to bring you all these books. You want us to keep at it, reckon it's worth more than a few free glasses of that swill you call liquor.
Gentlemen, gentlemen. I urge you once again to take the long view here. When we find this book - and believe me, we will find it - we are going to build a new world. A world far greater, far more righteous than this one. And you and I are going to be perched right on top of it, looking down upon it, masters of all creation!
And you know, I think you're absolutely right. 
That is worth more than a few glasses of liquor. A whole lot more.
The book I want is out there somewhere, just waiting to be found. Once there were millions of copies - you only need to find one! Find it and bring it here. And I promise you, you will be rewarded beyond anything you can imagine.
This better not be bullshit.
Might help if they knew just what they were looking for.
Not one of them can read. How would they even know when they found it?
So how's about you just tell me?
Two years now you been sending these crews into the outland. Burning up gas we can barely spare. For a goddamn book? What the hell kinda book can be worth all this?
What about these?
Put them with the others.
What's this place across the street? They got any water?
We got our own underground spring here. Only fresh water in a hundred miles - if's you can pay for it.
I'll be back.
If that battery ain't here when I get back, I will use this gun on your kneecaps and I will put this building to the torch and I will watch it burn to the ground with you alive inside it. So help me God.
Is that you, honey?
Something wrong?
More books came in from the road today.
Oh? It's been a while.
And it'll be a while longer. Just another pile of useless junk. If we don't find the right one soon - if I can't give these people what they want to hear...
You'll find what you're looking for. It's out there somewhere. You just have to have faith.
Faith? Is that what you think we're missing around here?
My old man used to have faith. He had it in spades. My mother, too. 
You know where it got them? You know where it got me?
Faith is for the weak. It's for them out there, the sheep. This world is what you can see and touch and taste. It's what you make it. All these years with me, you still don't have any grasp of that? What's wrong with you, woman?
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Hey. You okay?
You just get me all riled up with that kind of talk. It's not what I need from you right now.  You know what I need right now?
Outlander? Let me see-
What'll it be?
Water.
That's the good stuff. Gotta eat into my own ration to sell it - so I don't sell it cheap.
That'll get you maybe half-way.
What about that?
That's the best I got.
Solara!
Take this out back and get it filled.
That was my cat.
Fine specimen.
I saw you push him off the bar.
I didn't push him.
You raised your hand at him.
Sorry. It won't happen again.
Hey, how about another drink, Hog?
That cat's been comin' in here for nigh on two years. It got more right to be here than you. Who the fuck do you think you are?
I don't want any trouble.
Well, that's too bad, `cause-
I know you. Murderer of innocent travelers on the road. You're going to spend eternity drowning in a lake of fire for the things that you've done. Did you know that?
You go on back to your table and I'll be on my way. All right?
You push Hog, you push all of us.
Cursed be the ground because of you. By toil shall you eat of it. Thorns and thistles shall it sprout for you. From the ground were you taken. For dust you are.
And to dust you shall return.
Did you hear that? What was that?
Maybe you should go check.
What in the hell is going on?
Get your asses out here!
Stop!
Please don't.
Go.
 ...What?
It ain't for me to judge you. Your time for that's gonna come. Believe me. Now go on. Get out of here.
Thank you.
I'm sorry for all the mess.
Hold it right there.
So, who are you?
Nobody. A walker in the outland.
I've met walkers before. Not a particularly civilized bunch. Some have even taken to eating their own kind, did you know that? You wouldn't be one of those savages now, would you?
He ain't got the shakes.
Good. This is a civilized town. Under God. Do you know what that means?
It means we have laws here. Laws set down long before any of us ever walked this earth. And one of them is, you don't eat the flesh of your brother. Else you're no better than an animal. And not welcome here.
So what's your business here, friend? Walkers don't usually come into town less they want something.
I had a battery needed charging and a canteen needed filling. I didn't come here looking for trouble.
Well, you sure as hell found it. Do you know who I am?
No.
My name's Carnegie. I own this bar. I own the whole town. You've never heard of me?
That's you out there on the street.
Remarkable likeness, isn't it? You'd never guess half the men who built it were blind. A small tribute from a grateful people. I was deeply touched.
You had slaves build you a monument to yourself?
Don't call them slaves. That's an old word. I'm not a slaver. I'm trying to help these people.
In the outland the sightless are preyed upon like sick animals. Here at least they're protected. They do the essential work others don't want. And in return they eat, they drink, they survive. Last year, a couple of them even got married - performed the ceremony myself.  You see, I'm not exploiting these people - I'm saving them! Any one of them is free to leave whenever they wish. But here they stay. And they thank me every single day for their salvation!
It's none of my business what you do here. Like you said, it's your town. I just want to be on my way.
What's your name, walker?
All right, I guess we just call you Walker. Don't see too many folks your age these days. You lived in the world before? You can read?
I read every day.
That's good. Good man. We educated folk, we need to stick together, if we're ever going to rebuild this world. People like you and me, we're the future.
What do you want with me?
Straight to the point. I like that. Fact is, you could be in a lot of trouble. This is a peaceful town. You walk in here, armed, and the next thing a dozen of my good citizens are dead. I've hanged men for less. I could hang you.  Or, you could come work for me.
What?
I never once saw anyone handle themselves the way you did down there in that bar. I don't know where you learned it, but I sure as hell could use it.
I'm not interested.
People who work for me can live better than any walker ever dreamed. Real beds, clean water, hot food. Women, even. You could do a lot worse, my friend.
I'm not your friend. And I'm not staying. I got someplace I need to be. Out west.
West? There is nothing west. It's all gone, a long time ago.
I've been told different.
By who?
All right, look. I'm going to make you an offer of goodwill. Stay the night, think it over. Try a little local hospitality. We'll talk again in the morning. If you're still not interested, you're free to go. No hard feelings.
Thank you for your offer. But I'd prefer to just leave right now. So you can either let me out of here, or I can kill my way out.
Let him go.
Oh, shit...
How's my battery?
It's, uh... it's gonna take a little longer than I thought.
How much longer?
It's gotta charge overnight. You, uh, you can always stay here in town, pick it up in the morning.
You remember what I said would happen if I came back here and you didn't have my battery?
It's right here! It's just gonna take a while longer. I swear.
I knew you'd reconsider.
Yeah? How'd you know that?
None of the walkers I've seen come here from the outland were ever what you'd call smart. I mean all those years out there alone on the road, some with their brains half- fried from eating each other - it's understandable why you people aren't the brightest bulbs in the box. But I never met one so dumb that he'd turn down a meal and a bed if it was offered.
So you didn't send someone across the street to the engineer?
Engineer? I don't know what you're talking about. If there's something wrong, maybe I can help.
This is Redridge. He's kind of my right-hand man around here.
He'll show you to your room.
Enjoy your stay. There'll be someone outside your room all night. If you need anything.
Hello?
I have this for you. Water for washing and some food.
Well... are you going to take it?
Oh. Thank you.
You're very welcome.
It'll be dark soon.
Can I get you anything else?
No, thank you.
Well. Have a good night.
You're Carnegie's woman?
Why do you ask?
Just making conversation is all. Haven't had one of those in a while. Not a real one, leastways.
He found me in the outland. I was sixteen, my family had been... well, they were gone. There was just me and my baby.
You had a baby?
I'd met some men on the road. Bad men. They...
It's all right.
I was on the road for a year after that. I couldn't feed myself, let alone my little girl. And then Bill found us and he promised he'd take care of us. He told me he was going to make a place where we could be safe. And he did. He did all that. He built this whole town. He kept us safe. And he raised that child like she was his own. He's been so good to both of us. He saved us, really.
You want to eat some?
When did you go blind? In the war? You get caught in a flash?
No, I was born this way. I think I'm lucky like that.
Lucky?
It's not like I ever knew what I'm missing. I was already used to being like this by the time... by the time it all happened. So I got around pretty good even when I was on my own. And now it's easy. I know every creaky old floorboard in here, and it's not like I ever go any place else. Bill would never allow it. He worries about me so much.
I should go. He'll be wondering where I am.
Thank you. I enjoyed our conversation.
So did I.
You took your time in there. How long does it take to deliver a plate of food and some water?
He wanted to talk.
Oh? What about?
Nothing really. He asked me what it was like to be blind.
He tell you anything about him?
No. I don't think he likes to talk about himself much.
Yeah, I got that.
I don't think he's going to change his mind by morning. I don't think he's going to stay.
What makes you say that?
Just strikes me as the kind of man who's of a mind, is all. Doesn't seem like the type to go changing it once it's set.
Well, we'll just see about that.
You saw him. He's not like the others. You won't be able to smooth- talk him and wrap him around your finger like you usually do.
Who said anything about me?  I'm sending Solara.
You're doing what? CARNEGIE You know how often these walkers get laid? Never. Least not by anything living or willing. Girl like her can be very persuasive.
You can't send her in there with him. He's dangerous, he's a killer!
You went in there readily enough.
That's different. Solara's just a child, she can't-
She's a grown woman now, Claudia. Sooner or later you're going to have to accept that. She has to earn her keep around here, same as the rest of us.
By working as a whore? That's all you think she's fit for?
We've each been given a talent to help us make our way in this world. Some people's gift is more evident than others. Solara's sure as hell is.
What kind of a man are you?
I'm the kind of man who'd pull a helpless blind girl off the road, a girl who'd been beaten and raped, and give her a place where she can live without fear! Without me you'd be just another no-eye, lying dead in the outland, picked clean by the buzzards, or shoveling dirt down there with the others. That's the kind of man I am!
I don't live without fear. I haven't for a long time now.
Where are you going?
I'm not going to let you do this.
You're not going to let me?  Nobody tells me what I can and can't do in my own town. Nobody. I built this world, and I am God here! So don't go thinking about screwing with my plans. You know how this works. Solara goes against me, you get hurt. You go against me, she gets hurt.
So let's not see anybody get hurt. Okay?
Come in.
Hi. Can I come in?
Someone was already here with food and water. I got everything I need.
You sure about that?
It's too bright in here. Mind if I turn it down a little?
That's better. I'm Solara. You're Walker, right?
No. My name's Eli.
That short for something? Elias?
Elijah.
Elijah. I never heard that one before. It's kinda cute.
Look, I don't mean to be rude. But I'm really not interested.
You sure about that? It gets mighty lonely out there on the road.
If you're worried about money, this is all paid for. The whole night.
It's not that. You're a very nice girl. But I'm not that kind of man.
They're all that kind of man. He moves her hand away. Gently pushes her back a step.
I'm not.
They told me you were crazy. Maybe they were right.
I'm sorry. Good night.
Please don't make me leave. I have to stay the night. If I don't...
If you don't, what?
He'll hurt my mom.
Who will? Carnegie?
Maybe he and I oughta have words.
No! Please, don't!
He's hurting you. He's hurting your mother. He's-
He's my dad.
Look, if you want to help me, just let me stay here tonight. We don't have to do anything. I'll sleep on the floor. Tomorrow you can tell my dad that we had a good time. I'll be no trouble, I swear.
You want to have a conversation?
You know, you don't have to be afraid of me. What happened down there in the bar...
I'm not afraid of you. I know you didn't start that trouble. When I first saw you, I knew you weren't the type to go looking for it.
How'd you know that?
My mom says I'm a good judge of character. She says I can read people. That I know a good man when I see one.
So... you're pretty old, right?
I'm sorry. I just mean, I haven't seen too many people your age. How old are you exactly?
You know, I don't rightly remember.
But you're old enough. I mean, you remember what it was like? In the world before?
What was it like?
Better than this.  People lived longer back then. Longer than me. Some were more than a hundred years old.
Come on.
I swear, it's true. Nowadays it's not the same. If you're sick or you're weak or you're old you won't last long out on the road.
So how come you have?
Can I read you something?
Wait. You can read?
And you have a book? ELI Not just any book.
The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in the paths of righteousness.
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. For you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me, all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
That's beautiful. Did you write that?
 No.
What book is it from? Is it poetry?
I guess you could think of it that way. It's from the Holy Bible.
I never heard of it. What's it about?
It's about love, and forgiveness, and life and death, and mercy, and revenge, and the beginning and the end of the world. I guess it's about a little bit of everything.
Can I see?
What? I'm not going to do anything.
I'm sorry. I'm charged to protect this book. I can't trust it with anyone. Not even for a while.
What's so special about that book?
It's the last one. There are no other books like this. All the others are gone - destroyed by the war or in the burnings that came after. This is the only one that survived until now. The last one anywhere.
How can you know that?
I just know.  For a long while after it happened, I just wandered on the road like most everybody else. There were still a lot of people around back then, in the beginning. I didn't really know what I should do or where I was going. I was just moving from place to place, trying to stay alive. And then one day I heard this voice. I don't know how to explain it, it's like it was coming from inside me. But I could hear it, clear as day. Clear as I can hear you talking to me now.
What did it say?
It led me to this place, I don't really know where. And I found this book buried deep under some rubble. No way no-one was ever going to find it if they didn't know exactly where to look.
But you knew because the voice told you?
That's right. And that voice told me to carry the book west. 
It told me that a path would be laid out before me, that I'd be led to a place where this book would be safe. It told me I'd be protected against anyone or anything that tried to stand in my way. If only I would have faith.  That was twenty-five years ago. And I've been walking ever since.
 Because a voice you heard in your head told you to.
I'm not crazy. I didn't imagine it. I know what I heard.
So who was it? The voice?
A very important, very powerful man.
More powerful than my dad?
 I should say so, yes.
Would you teach me to read?
What?
I never learned. No-one around here knows how. Only my dad, and he won't teach me. I think he likes being the only one who can read. I think it makes him feel powerful.
I think you're probably right.
So would you teach me?
I'm sorry. I'm leaving tomorrow. And I won't be back this way, ever.
Are you hungry?
I guess a little.
There's some food on the table over there. Let's eat.
It's okay, it's okay. He's with me.  Don't be afraid, pal. This is Solara. She's our friend.
It's okay. It means he likes you.
It does? ELI Trust me, if he didn't like you, you'd know about it.
Did you really mean that?
Mean what?
That I'm your friend.
Sure.
Our father, we thank you for this meal which you have been so gracious to place before us.
We thank you for a warm bed and a roof over our heads on a cold night such as this.  And we thank you for the gift of friendship in these hard times.
Amen.  You say that last part too.
Amen. And now we eat?
And now we eat.
Good morning, Solara.
I said good morning, Solara.
Morning, dad.
How was your night? Did you sleep well?
I did like you asked. Isn't that what you really want to know? Just come out and say it.
You don't speak to your father like that. When I ask you a civil question, I expect a civil answer.
Did he say anything?
No. We didn't talk much.
Well, do you think you managed to change his mind about staying?
I don't know. He said he had to go.
So he did talk? What else did he say? Come on, I want all of it!
That's all he said. That he was going to be leaving this morning.
We'll see. This is my town, nobody leaves until I say they leave.
Solara, honey, eat something.
Our father, thank you for this meal which you have been so gracious to place before us.
Thank you for my mother. Please watch over her and keep her safe.
Solara...
Thank you for all the-
Solara! She snaps suddenly out of it, looks at her father.
What the hell are you doing?
God didn't put this food on the table. Do you hear me?  Who put this food on the table?
I said who put this food on the table?
 You did.
Who taught you that?
Eli taught me.
 Who the hell is Eli?
The walker. That's his name.
And he taught you how to say those words? How did he know them?
He had them written down in a book.
What kind of a book?
I don't remember! It was an old leather book. It had kind of a... thing on the front of it.
Show me.
He had a bible?
That's what it was. A holy bible. Daddy, what's wrong? Did I...
Something wrong, boss?
Something wrong? Something wrong? The walker's gone!
That can't be. I had a man outside his room the whole time.
He jumped out the window, you idiot! You didn't think to put a man outside the fucking window?  Find him. Now!
Boss, he could be anywhere. He...  A battery. Didn't he say something about a battery?
Go! Go!
 It ain't your concern. Stay on the path.
Dammit...
Let her go.
That cannon of yours casts a pretty wide net. I don't reckon you can hit me without hitting her.
I reckon you're right.
This, though? With this I'll shave the hairs clean off your balls at a hundred paces. You believe me?
I believe you. I have to say I'm surprised to hear that language coming from you, though. I mean, you being a holy man and all.
She told me all about it. Told me all about the bible, too.  Can I see it?
No.
You know, I've been searching for a book like that one for years. All I've ever wanted was to bring the word of God to these poor unfortunates here. To shine its light upon them and give them something in this wretched world that they could believe in. Something to live for! It's why I built this town, did you know that? All we've been missing is the word to show us the way. And now, praise the Lord, you've brought it to us.
It's not right to keep that book hidden away, all to yourself. The word is meant to be shared with others. It's meant to be spread! Isn't that what you want? I could help you do that. You and me, we could do it together.
The Lord himself told me that if I carried this book west, one day I would find the place where it was needed. Where it would be safe. Where it belonged.
But this ain't it.
Come on.
What? What is it?
You shall not make for yourself any graven image...
Now we can go.
Where are we going?
I told you where I'm going. You're free to go wherever you want.
Wait... I'm not coming with you?
You're only going to slow me down.
So what the hell was all that about back there?
The man was hurting you. I don't like that, so I put a stop to it. Now you're free. He can't hurt you any more.  No need to thank me.
Thank you? For what? What am I supposed to do now?
Whatever you want. That's what being free is.
Whatever I want. Except go with you.
I have to get where I'm going. I can't be worrying about someone else along the way.
I thought you were my friend.
It's dangerous in the outland. I wouldn't want you to get hurt.
I'll be safe so long as I'm with you. I know it.
You don't want this life. I gotta do what I gotta do. Don't have no choice in it. But you do. And I can't let you choose this. You don't want to be like me. You don't want to spend your life alone.
If I came with you, I wouldn't be alone. And neither would you.
I'm sorry. Look, maybe it's best you just go on back to town.
Fine! I'll do just that! I had a life there! A family! I didn't ask you to save me! I didn't ask you for anything!
 Fine.
Thank you, darling.
He killed four of my men and walked out of town without a scratch. They shot off a hundred rounds at him and he didn't get hit once. I never even heard of anything like that.
You know, I always thought of myself as a shepherd. Bringing together the wayward and the lost. Tending to my flock. But all the things I want to do, I can't do them on my own. The one thing I've needed is the one thing that's always been missing. Then one day it walks right into town - so close I can almost touch it - and then walks right on out again.
I want you to put a crew together and go out after him.
He's not going to work for you. I think he's made that plain.
I'm not interested in him any more. I only want the book he's carrying.
If I'm gonna risk my ass hunting down this maniac in the outland, I need to know it's gonna be worth it. I need to know what's so special about this goddamn book.
You have no idea. You're too young, you don't remember the world before. But I do. I remember.
When I was a kid my parents used to read that book every goddamn day. My mother, she'd read it along with this smooth-talking preacher on the TV screen. They used to be able to beam these guys right into your house, into every house in the world, through the air. Like magic.  She worked two jobs and she sent every spare penny she had to that fucking guy on the TV. My old man, he'd read that book, then he'd get liquored up and kick my ass, tell me all about the power and the glory and how I was going to burn forever in hell for the sins I was born with. He made sure he beat it into me good.
Don't you see? It's not just any book. 
It has the power to motivate people. It can give them hope, it can terrify them. It can shape them. Control them.  Do you remember how I built this town? It wasn't done with force, and it wasn't done just with water. It was done with the power of words. I created this place out of nothing, because people believed in a promise that I sold to them. Those guys on the TV, they were richer than you could ever dream, and it was all built the same way. With words. With promises. And with that book.  That book is a weapon. Aimed right at the hearts and minds of the weak and the desperate. Just imagine what I could do with it.
Boss... we're running out of water and the people are running out of patience. You're trying to tell me that a book is going to keep them in line?
Oh, it'll do much more than that. The water in this town may run dry, but faith - that springs eternal! And that faith will help turn this town into a city. And this city into a nation. It will help me build a new world. In my image. People will come from far and wide to hear what's inside of it. They'll follow me anywhere just to get a taste of it. And they'll do whatever I tell them.
And what if this book don't work? What if it don't say what you want it to say?
Oh, it'll say what I want, I can promise you that. Because I'm going to rewrite it. I'll keep the parts that work for me and make the rest whatever I need it to be.  A new bible, for a new world.
What do you think, darling? A whole new world, to do with as we will. Won't that be grand?
Find that book.
He has half a day on us already.
So use the motor pool.
There ain't much gas in reserve.
Whatever there is, use it.
What about Solara?
She's still out there. With him.
Right. Right. Of course. Bring her back, too, if you can. But-
The book. I know.
Shit. Shit.
Where the hell am I?
Hello?
Hello? Can anyone help me?
Hello? Is anybody there?
Are you all right?
Oh. Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. You go along, I'll be okay.
You look like you need some help.
No, really! I'm fine. Really... I need a man to help. Not you. You just keep along. Please.
It'll just take a minute.
Really, it's fine! Please!
Let her go! She ain't got nothing!
I ain't too sure about that.
This wasn't the deal!
Shut your mouth, bitch. You oughta be grateful you're getting a break.
Never did care much for that dried- up old snatch anyhow.
This one, though... this one looks fresh. You a virgin?
Well, let's find out.
I offer you both one final chance in this life to seek forgiveness for your sins so that your souls may find salvation. Will you say with me the act of contrition?
Fuck you.
Some might think it'd be most fitting to leave you here like this. Let you die slow in the sun. But I know better. I know where you're going. And the sooner you get there, the sooner you'll get what's coming to you.
Wait!
I want to say it. I want to be forgiven.
Repeat after me. Oh God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee, and I detest all my sins.
I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to confess my sins, and do penance, and to amend my life. Amen.
Amen...
You came back for me.
What are friends for?
This is the deal. You keep up. You pull your weight. You fall behind, I can't help you. Okay?
Okay.
What about her?
There's nothing can be done for her.
You killed it! That cute little thing!
It's good eating, is what it is.
That's not funny.
If you're going to be on the road, you can't be picky about what you eat. You eat what's there to eat.
I'm not eating that.
 More for me.
Father, we thank you for your generosity in providing us with this meal. Bless this food to our use and us to thy service, and keep us ever mindful of the needs of others. Amen.
What does that taste like?
Tastes like chicken.
What is that?
It's a Saint Christopher medal.
Who's Saint Christopher? Is he a character from your book?
Christopher was a man who lived a long time ago. He wanted to be a good man, he wanted to help people. So he would stand by a river that had no bridge and carry people across. He was a big strong man and there was no one he couldn't carry.
Then one day a young child came to the river and asked to be carried across. Christopher tried to carry him but he was too heavy. He was just a small boy but he was heavier than any man he had ever carried. The boy explained that he was the son of God, and that he was so heavy because he bore all the sins of the world. After that, Christopher was able to carry him across and when they got to the other side the boy baptized him in the river. And that's how he became a saint. Later on, he was known as the patron saint of travelers.
What is a saint, anyway?
It's someone who spent their life doing good things for others. Enough that God himself took a special interest in them.
Someone like you.
No. Not like me. Saints ain't killers. And I done too much of that. Spilled too much blood.
Will you read me some more from the book?
It's late. You should get some sleep. Maybe tomorrow.
Eli?
What are you doing?
You scared me! I thought you were asleep.
On the road you sleep with one eye open. I asked you what you were doing.
I just wanted to see the book.
You want to see the book, you ask me. Nobody touches it but me. Ever. Until it gets where it's going. Do you understand?
Tell me you understand!
Okay! I understand! Ow!
It's no use to you anyway. You don't know how to read it.
Well... now we have the time, maybe you can teach me.
Maybe. Get some sleep.
He's been here.
The girl's with him.
Move out!
I said move out!
I heard this guy's protected somehow, some... power from up above. That there ain't nothing on this earth can touch him.
He's just a man. You put a bullet in him, he'll go down like any other. I don't want to hear no more of this superstitious horseshit!
You say you've been walking for twenty-five years. Have you ever considered that you might be lost?
No.
But how can you know? How can you know this is the right way?
I told you. My path has been laid out before me.
Yeah, but laid out by who?
By Almighty God.
Well if this God guy's so mighty, how come it's taking you so long to get where you're going? Doesn't he know the way?
You want to stay on this road with me, don't ever let me hear you take his name in vain like that again.
Sorry.
God has a reason for everything being the way it is. It's not always apparent to us. But it is his plan nonetheless.
So, is he talking to you right now? Telling you where to go?
It's not like that. It's kinda hard to explain. I'm guided by faith.
I don't know what that word means.
It means you know something even though you don't know it.
That doesn't make any sense at all.
It doesn't have to.
I don't get it. It looks almost... normal. Like nothing ever happened. How can it still be out here?
I don't know.
Maybe we should look inside. There might be food.
Stay behind me.
This is weird.
Yeah.
Shit.
What?
Who are you?
My name is Eli. This is Solara. We're travelers, that's all. We don't mean you any harm.
You cut my padlock. I saw you. Trying to break into our house.
I'm sorry. We didn't think anybody lived here. We thought it was abandoned, like all the rest.
Take a look around you. Look at this yard. Does it look abandoned to you?
No, sir. I... like what you've done with the place.
What's your business here?
No business. We're sorry to have troubled you. If you'll let us down we'll happily be on our way.
George, look at them! They're not robbers or road agents! One of them's just a girl!
Seen that before. Oldest trick in the book.
Oh, stop! It's no trick. Let them down!
I'm so sorry about my husband. We so rarely get visitors these days, he's suspicious of everybody.  I'm Martha and this is my husband George. Would you care for some tea?
I'm afraid we don't have any cake or biscuits for the tea. They ran out some time ago.
Please.
How do you like it?
It's.. uh...
It's very good.
Have you always lived here?
For almost forty years now. This home is our pride and joy, isn't it, George?
We refused to leave, even during the troubles. We said, didn't we George, we said if we're going to die anywhere, we're going to die right here, in our own home.
I don't understand how you've survived out here this long.
Well, George is something of a handyman, aren't you, dear? He did a lot of work on the place, making it safe. We may be old, but we're resilient. We've had more than a few who've tried to take this place from us. Haven't we, George?
Yes. Yes we have.
Are these... graves?
Of course. It would be uncivilized not to bury them. We're not barbarians.
Plus, it's good for the soil.
Come on back inside. I think I might be able to rustle up some sandwiches.
We have to get out of here.
They look so sweet... I would never have believed they were killers.
They're worse than that.
What?
They didn't just kill these people.  They ate them.
They what? ELI There's a disease in the outland. Spread by eating human meat. It affects the brain. Dementia, loss of motor function. Did you notice the old woman's hands shaking? She's got it. They've both got it.
Oh my God...
I found some meat for those sandwiches! Are you hungry?
No! Thank you!
We really must be going.
So soon?
Yes, I'm afraid so.
Are you sure you won't stay?
Yes. Thank you again for the tea.
Oh no... it's my dad. It's his men.
Are you sure?
I recognize the cars.
Back inside.
What did you bring upon us?
George? What's wrong?
A whole convoy of armed degenerates, that's what's wrong! Coming here for them! And they led them right to us!
Oh no they don't...
Martha, what are you doing?
I finally got this house just the way I want it. I'm not going to let anybody tear it apart!
Where did you get all this stuff?
Took `em off them who came looking to take the place from us. Built up quite the stash over the years.
You know how to fire a gun?
My daddy showed me once.
Just like riding a bike.
I never rode a bike.
How about you, you know how to-
Never mind.
We know you're in there! Come on out with your hands up and your weapons on the deck and nobody needs to get hurt.
All right, look. I'm gonna make it easy on y'all. Bring out the girl with the book.
That's all we want. The girl and the book. The rest of you's can go your way.
What are we going to do?
Hand me my pack.
Holy shi...
Get down! Everybody get down!
Damn you, return fire!
Come and get it, you god-damn sons of mother-fucking bitches!
It's all right. We're going to be all right. Trust me.
You remember what I told you about faith?
We're going to get out of this alive. Both of us. I know.
Because God told you?
Because God told me.
What about us?
He didn't mention you.
Martha? Martha!
We got any more of those RPGs?
Screw this.
Get clear!
Solara?
Eli!
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Oh God...
Come on. We're going out the back. We're running.
Go ahead and try it, holy man. You ain't that fast.
Where's the book?
I ain't playing.
Check the pack.
It's gotta be.
Hello, what have we here?
Fuck! Get it off! Get it off me!
If you don't got the book, what fucking use are you?
Wait!
It's here! I've got it! Please don't kill him.
Solara...
It's just a book, Eli. No book is worth giving up your life for.
You're wrong.
You did good, sweetheart. Your daddy would be proud. He knew you'd come through for him.
He said he would hurt my mom. If I didn't help him.
 Daddy's little girl...
I want you to let him go.
What?
You've got what you came for. You don't need him. Let him go.
He's killed a dozen of my men.
If you hurt him, I'm not coming back with you. You'll have to drag me kicking and screaming.
Take your shit and get out of here.
No weapons.
I told you we'd both live. Now do you have faith?
What the hell...?
Stop, stop!
Shit. Turn around!
We ain't got the gas for it!
She's getting away!
We got the book! And we got barely enough gas to make it back as it is! We can't go chasin' her!
Stupid little bitch...  Drive on.
Come on, come on...
No... No!
Eli! Eli!
Eli...
Thought you'd gone back to town.
I can't go back there. Eli, I'm so sorry.
For what?
For what? I betrayed you! I gave them the book!
You did what you believed you had to.
You're not mad at me?
I forgive you.
Here. I thought you might still need this.
Thank you.
What are you going to do now?
Same as always. Keep heading west.
Why? I mean, you don't have the book any more.
But I still have my faith.
What's that?
It's grass. It used to grow all over the place.
How come it's here?
I don't know. Less poison in the air this near to the ocean, maybe.
What's wrong?
Nothing. Just a cramp.
What?
Do you smell that?
Smell what?
Salt in the air. We're close to the ocean. We're almost there.
Come on.
Watch your footing. Step where I step.
This... this is the world before?
What's left of it.
Do you see that?
I see it. Is that it?
That's it.
Who goes there?
Identify yourselves!
My name is Elijah Stone. I have a message for your boss. I need you to tell him that I have a King James Bible in my possession.
Remain where you are! Do not attempt to move or you will be fired upon!
Be prepared to surrender any weapons at the gate!
They're clean.
Welcome, both of you. I'm Professor Lombardi. I'm the curator here.
Elijah Stone.
Solara.
Solara. What a delightful name. Is that by any chance Shakespearean?
I, uh, I think it's Japanese.
Wonderful.
Is it true what they tell me? You have a King James Version?
Been carrying it with me for twenty- five years.
My goodness. I can't tell you how exciting this is. Well, come, come! 
I'll give you the nickel tour and then we can all sit down and take a look at it.
Yes, we've been doing this for some time now. Collected over thirty thousand volumes from generous donors all across the nation. We even have a printing press that we hope to have operational soon.
You turned the whole prison into a library?
Well, not exactly. We're more like a storage facility. We're holding these books here in trust, if you like. When society gets back on its feet and no longer needs us to preserve these volumes, they'll be here waiting.  I must ask you, how did you hear about us? We've been doing everything we can to get the word out, but we always like to know where our benefactors come from.
I was sent here by God.
Is that right? Well, it's good to know we're getting such high- profile referrals these days.  I must say, I am so excited that we finally have a King James. You know, we have a Talmud here, we have two Korans, we even have that Scientology book. But never a Christian bible, until now. I honestly believed it was the one book I'd never see again, after what happened...
May I ask what condition it's in?
It's a little beat-up. But it'll do the job.
Well, then. What say we take a look at it?
Is there someplace we could sit?
Of course. Right this way.
Did you get it?
Show me.
The new world begins here...
What the fuck is this?
Do you have something you can write with?
Mmm? Oh, yes of course!
Could you please bring us some writing paper?
Bring a lot of it.
What? What is it?
Are you ready?
What exactly am I writing?
Pay close attention and write down every word exactly as I say it.
The First Book of Moses called Genesis. Chapter one, verse one. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Verse two. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. Verse three. And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
What's wrong?
You told me once that you know how to read this. This blind language.
Well, a long time ago, when I was a little girl...
You're going to read it for me. Every word. And I'm going to write it down. Start at the beginning.
I'm sorry. It's been so long. I don't remember. I don't remember any of it.
God fucking dammit!
Bill, is there something-
Just go. Just get out of my sight.
Dear Lord, thank you for giving me the strength and the conviction to complete the task you entrusted to me. Thank you for guiding me straight and true, through the many obstacles in my path. 
And for keeping me resolute when all around seemed lost.
Thank you for your protection and for your many signs along the way.
Thank you for the good that I have done. For whatever light you were able to shine into the darkness of this world through me.
You know, you don't have to leave. You're welcome to stay here with us. You'll be safe.
Thanks.
But I gotta do what I gotta do.
Where will you go?
Home.
Thank you for the friend I made.
Please watch over her as you watched over me.
Thank you for allowing me finally to rest. I'm so very tired. The time of my departure is at hand and now I surrender my soul into your care, at peace in knowing that I have carried out your will. That I have done right with my time on this earth.
I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race.
I have kept the faith.
