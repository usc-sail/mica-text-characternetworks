I saw a severed head once. Except for the, paleness, it looked healthy, well-fed. The end came abruptly you could tell 'cause the mouth froze in mid-sentence. "Shh.  ," the curled lips attempted. Like it started saying "shucks" or "Shirley" or... "shit happens." Your eyes don't forget things like that. Like you don't forget the sound animals make when they're humping. Primal. Raw. They endure in you forever because the senses have a brain all their own and they recall long after you've succumbed to the la-la of forgetfulness.  Sometimes when it's dark out,-so dark it's black, I'll see HIM.
The principal did'nothing. Like schoolyard terrorism is no worse than being tardy. What's the matter with education? Back when, you could go to school and learn about Betsy Ross and... mollusks and... not get stabbed on the way home.
It is the Superhero, his identity safely concealed under the collar of a tattered TRENCHCOAT. He traverses the loading deck, PASSENGERS boarding and disembarking around him. He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway. He strolls over to a CIGARETTE MACHINE, up against the grafetti- raped subway wall. On the wall, a line of profanity declares that...
At the ramp, and on cue, the subway tram closes its doors. Trembles. Moves. Steams into the deep dark tunnel. White SMOKE mushrooms from its tail. It lingers in the air as we...
a He-man pose, his biceps in the wind.
How the fuck can I help you sir?
A room.
Top floor, 7F. Fifteen a pop, up front.  And your John Hancock makes it sweet. The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN sheet. Scribbles
on the dotted line. Fish hands over the key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock's grab.
I don't take messages, I don't do favors, and I don't know you from Jack. You want sheets, they're extra. Towel's extra. Plunger's extra.
I need quiet. Is it quiet?
Quiet? Hey pal, we look like a public library to you? The girls work. Some of them scream, some of them moan...
On a bed, sprawled on his back, Aaron gazes up at the empty ceiling - the black eye squats prominently on his face. Aaron brings his hand before his eyes. Looks at it. Studies it. Slowly, his fingers converge into a tight FIST - a boy's interpretation of a man's weapon. A gentle KNOCK disperses the knuckles. Horus peers in.
How's the eye?
Black. Horus enters. Stands awkwardly before his son.
It'll be gone in a week. Mom'11 touch it up with some make-up and you won't even know it's there.
Yeah I will. And I don't want any girly make-up on my face. Horus deposits himself on the bed. Hunches over-h13 knees.
 There'll always be people around who'll... exert force over those of us who just want to live in peace. Aaron listens, observing his father's efforts.
 The thing to do is... to avoid them. They're no-wins. Can't-wins. You hold the anger... and move on. You hold the anger.  I tell you because I can't take it, seeing you hurt. You're part of me.
I'm late for work. Get some sleep. Tomorrow always feels better...
.after a good night sleep. The light FLICKS off and the man's silhouette form exits the room.
It startles the man. He.tries to regroup.
Mary.
the moment. And out of nowhere...
_the complete morning routine. Her maternal h'ahdf Stay inside.

 I got the only mother does this. in the world that I'm not lisMARY g. Lalalala..,

 Olga...
Roheim. Let's go home. Roheim stirs...
. bitch. From the dark recesses of sleep - he wakes. Straightens up. Slurps back his dignity.
I just made the last run. He helps the old man to his feet.
You're a good man.
 it's about responsibility... with what is empowered in you... to correct the ills of man. No foam. No gel. Just skin and the razor edge of his belt BUCKLE - it slices through stubble, clearing up a face that has yet to sleep.
From the street, notice the display windows - all mannequins come complete with outfit and ultra-erect nipples. As EMPLOYEES file into the service entrance, out comes Horus and Roheim. They head streetward, to the sidewalk. Roheim unscrews the battery cap from his flashlight. Takes a swig from its hollow interior.
I'll just play out the rest of this Eight Ball... He laps up the last drop. Reloads it with a couple of batteries from his jacket.
 like that. Horus looks on - silent.
 Boys... The cops smile at one another. A large SHOTGUN rests fully erect between them. And they drive off. Horus, watching them go, focuses in on the
Bastards... couldn't protect a pitcher of warm spit... couldn't find their asshole with common sense and a thumb.
Something brews within this superman.
Will you slow down.
I know it. I know it.
I think I'm... slow down... I'm gaining weight. Honey, take a look at my waist.
What?
Is my dress too tight?
What? Nothing. It's fine.
Really, my waist isn't too big?
What? Not here, mom.
All right, already. Two-thirty. You do n't leave the building till then. I'll be there.
I know it, mom. Can I go now?
Give me a kiss, you snot.
 Geez! He turns back. Plants a kiss on Mary's smiling cheeks.
Two-thirty.
All right, mom. He leaves, merging into the undulating sea of children.
 You want anything from the store? He's gone.
Clyde... Clyde shoves the remains of the paper at Horus - in his face.
Picked this up for you.  Say thanks.
Thanks.
 You're a good man.
You're sweet, Nick. He cracks a wet smile. Mary, aware, unhands the artichoke. Moves on.
Hey, what's the idea? The man turns. Smiles. His smile fades, turning into a maniacal. grin. This man is TOM , as plainly evil as the eye can see.
You know what, you remind me of my grandma. Tom whips out a sawed-off SHOTGUN from his pants...
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. My name is Tom. These are my assistants, Jerry and Jerry. Why're we doing what we're doing, you ask? We got one word to say to you folks...  Recession.
 Thank you, Jerry. Tom is referring to Jerry's demonstration of the lotus Jerry does not respond.
I'm stuck. Mary, amongst the crowd, watcheson withinterest.
 And while I take care of business, my associates will be making their rounds. The Jerrys leap into action - guns pointing. They rummage the helpless patrons for jewelry, cash and collectables.
 Come on, is. What the hell you doing in a bank if you.got no money?
I'm here to withdraw money. This stumps the brainless beast. And over by the teller, while he's stuffing her bag...
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful. She's too scared for speech. But back on the bank floor...
 Give me that.
 No heroes! No heroes! Jerry #2 returns, bad news on his tongue.
He flew! Fucking Fred flew!
Fuck! Fuck! A wave of SIRENS punctuate their state of "fuck." It crescendoes around the building.
 I'm not going back. Mary, amongst the crowd, takes a glance at the CLOCK --one thirty.
 The pizza here, yet?
Negative.  Tami.
Ooh, one sec.  Time's... all Hell's gonna break loose, fellas.  My koochie, woochie, oochie ooo... A BLAST rings out from Central Fidelity. Glass shatters from the entrance. A body, the security guard, tumbles out and onto the sidewalk. Blood and brain exits in OOZES where the bullet had entered - he's probably dead.
Time's running out, fellas! The hostages grimace, hell not so far away.
I want that car, Ted!
Where's that car, Jesus!
It's out getting your pizza.
. a car and I want it NOW! And on this cue, the sky answers with a thunderous surprise - a CAR comes CRASHING down before the bank entrance. It came from the clouds and it looks familiar - it's the getaway Chevy, bruised and punctured beyond recognition, its hubcaps still reeling from the impact. The sky answers again, this time with the tattered body of FRED, the getaway driver  Fred lands on the hood of the Chevy, sinking into its metal frame. SHOCK waves across faces of stone. The cops all look up.
 What the...
A loaded beat. Tom, in mid-swallow, watches as a spectacular EXPLOSION of bricks sprays the air inside. A caped figure bursts into the scene amidst SCREAMS from clueless hostages. in the blink of an eye, Hancock has Jerry #2 by the collar. With a flick of the wrists, Jerry #2 is a human projectile en route to the windshield of a police vehicle outside. Jerry #1 opens FIRE on Hancock. Bullets careen off flesh of steel.
Stay away. Hancock does not respond.
What's going on, here? Hancock no response. Tom raises his gun, and meaning it.
Answer me! Say something!
 Why'd you go and do that for? Tom retrieves his ear from the ground. Tries to put it back, clutching his head. He bleeds.
Fuck... My shirt.
 Why don't we call it the day.
 Don't. I told you... I'm not going back.
What's eating you, man?
Man, you're jaded. I'm not asking for a rainbow...
you don't got to shower me with respect. Just a little.. tenderness, is all. Have you no mercy, mister?
 I'm all out. Let's go... And as he utters this, he approaches Tom.
Hancock is swarmed under MEDIA LIGHTS, reporters squeezing through a wall of people, police, trying to get a piece of this superman.
Tell me... what happened?
 You were late.
I was held up...
The asshole peed on me. I'm dog shit.
.at the bank. Honey, were they the same ones? Don't cry.
Get a grip, mom. They arrive home, both storming through the entrance and up the stairs.
How was your day? Mother and son - if eyes could disembowel.
Mr. Fisher.
 You're not unattractive.
Baldness is not fatal.
My wife ignores me.
Your wife's a cunt, Mr. Fisher.
We like you, Mr. Fisher. The girls acknowledge you, we all do.
No.
Yes.
Really? The secretary SCREAMS. All attention shifts to the BUILDING across the street. The secretary points...
The baby teeters along the edge. It heads for a FLAG pole, dazzled by the red-white-and-blue. It reaches out at fabric. Almost. Not quite. The baby DROPS from the precipice. On the street, people CHOKE on their tongues as gravity pulls the infant down. But wait... Hancock swoops out of the thin blue, swift and silent. He cradles the baby from utter concrete. He deposits the youngster with.the ecstatic crowd - they, of mostly the FEMALE persuasion, all form around the savior. We SEE in the background and across the street, the Jumper nose- diving into the sidewalk - without much fanfare.
. paramedics have taken the rescued tenants to County General for smoke inhalation but no serious injuries reported thanks to the superheroics of this mystery man...
 Mary? Mary blinks back her attention.
He's looking for answers. He's Upset.
 Let me see your eye...  I told him about the other cheek. Avoid confrontations... to turn the other cheek.
.He did. He turned the other cheek and they punched it.
You're late. I'll try again later. Horus finds his hat on the table. His eyes fall on Mary, her back to him. She's glued to the set.
How... what about you?
Mary?
Yes.
I... had no idea.
 What could you do? Horns - hat in hand, goes to the door. He wants to stay.
 Good thing he was there. I don't know what I'd do... if you... Mary does not hear him... until the door SHUTS behind her. She turns to face an empty room.
Coffee's by the... door.
For a second, light dances off the woman's aroused face: it's Veronica.
 Oh god. The man surfaces from her cleavage for air, his face wet with sweat and saliva. He brushes his cape away from his arm. Veronica uncoils yet another orgasm, her back arched, her breasts beckoning at ceiling. Quite abruptly, he lets her go. Rights his pants. Unlatches the window. She paws after him.
What'd I do?
 Hancock.
He crosses an alley. A band of THUGS, neighborhood kids of malcontent, surprises him. And. versa. They recoil at his uniform, his gun. They quickly realize that he's rent-a-security. The leader speaks first - he's SCARPO , as tough as a steel- belted radial. The others regroup their DRUGS.
Nutri-cop. Horus keeps walking.
Ain't half the Man. Horus simply walks away.
How about spreading some of that joy? Hancock turns and faces a young HOODLUM, scraggly in his own slimy kind of way. In a huff, he shoves Hancock up against the building. Presses a gun to Hancock's temple.
 Shit...
What are you thinking?! Hancock wrests the gun from his hand. Places it into his own mouth. FIRES two slugs inside. The Hoodlum FREAKS.
Huh?! Takes the smoking gun out of his mouth. Shoves it up the- Hoodlum's nose.
Want to see brain? Huh?! Sticks the gun back into his mouth. FIRES another shot inside. Takes it out and this time - jams it into the Hoodlums mouth. The Hoodlum proceeds to urinate in his pants.
 Please, mister. I got a baby coming.., a wife. I got student loans... Hancock - intense. Is this getting through?
Can't sleep. He rolls over the sofa, next to his mother. They watch VIDEO clips of the foiled bank heist: the crashing Chevy, the aerial maneuvers, the sheer invincibility of this man.
There's something about him... I don't know. A female REPORTER concludes the footage...
Up and out of the alley, the John flees - tail, between his legs. A long stare ensues - Hancock and the Whore, looking into each other's eyes for answers. The Whore approaches him. Touches his face - studies it. Moves it into the light.
 You've been to Hell, it looks. And you're tired...
My business card.  My office. Hancock inspects the matchbook - 555-GINA, etched inside.
 Gina.
Don't.
Just a quick one.
Don't 3119.
I want to.
Mom.
"Once there was a way, to get back homeward. Once there was a way, to get back home."
Oh, mom.
Shut up.
"Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I will sing a lullaby..."
"Golden slumber fills your eyes. Smiles awake you when you rise." Hancock wavers on consciousness - quite unlike him.
FOOTSTEPS approach, just seconds away. Close on Aaron, as blood drains from his face. His eyes dash for a garbage CAN - but is there time? Spengler. Erlick. Perceval. They can smell their prey.
He's not going anywhere.
'Less he can walk through wall.
Fuck... squeeze through brick.
 Let's rock it up. They turn the corner, attack mode. Aaron, nowhere in sight. Just the brick wall and a trash can. They converge, baffled. Erlick inspects the solid wall. Spengler scratches his head. But'Perceval's no fool. He spots the trash can. He motions the fellas over. They circle the can. A beat. They ATTACK... an empty can. No one inside. Nothing. That's because above them, no strings and no cables, Aaron hovers - under Hancock's capable arm. In mid-air, they hang for a second. Then, Hancock takes them away.
 No... no... no!
He reaches for his belt. Pulls out a cigarette. Lights it.
You smoke?
What?
Of course you don't. Nothing but a kid.  Smoke no evil. Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner.
 Ever curious... .what it's like? Aaron shakes his head.
 Go on... give it a try. One time. Won't kill you. Once. Aaron under pressure, acquiesces. He takes the stick. Sucks on it. Doubles over, coughing.
Good, huh? Tastes like compost... your first stick. Then, after a few more... it starts getting this. flavor. A little nicotine buzz. A while passes and all of a sudden, it's as sweet as candy. Only now, it takes a whole pack to get there.., and you won't settle till your, mouth's as sweet. Hancock takes another cool drag - Mr. Wisdom waxing philosophical.
Principles?
Principles. Here's one; very simple. Just about all you need to know: a man's got to do what a man's got to do.  I look at your face, the shiners. You took a shove and you let it go clean. Not good. That's a formula for future abuse... an invitation to the loser's dance. Letting it go. Walking away. , Bad policy. Won't be long 'fore you're running, looking for a place to hide.
What am I suppose to do?
You do what is necessary.
I wanted... there were three of them.
What is necessary.
To slip away, maybe." The fox decides to go down fighting, make a stand. Right?
 He gets away. Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette. Blows smoke.
No. The fox gets his ass kicked and some... I mean ripped apart by the dogs, like cheap fabric.
What're you saying?
But you know, when the last hound was through with him,-and he's walking away, he hears this noise. It's the fox and he's muttering something under his breath... words. The dog goes over. Gets up close. To hear what he's saying. You know what the fox's saying... just before he keels off? Aaron - negative.
What?
No regrets. You make a decision and you stick to it. Like a man's got to do. And "no regrets." Aaron - submitting it to memory.
Why're you telling me all this?
 Look at it this way... I got to do what I got to do.

. more.on the neighborhood robberies in our next hour.
I'm sorry.
Table's done. Mary turns to Aaron, offscreen.
Glasses.
Geez. Horus enters from the hallway, disheveled from sleep. He does not see the superman on his sofa. He continues into the kitchen.
He turns and beholds: Hancock,' rising in full garb, arm extended. All eyes on Horus - befuddled.
You know Hancock?
He comes for dinner. Close on Hancock. Close on Horus.
Man of the house?
 Which piece would you like?
Breasts, please. Horus, watching everything - Mary and her every blush.
You want milk?
No. It gives me gas. Thank you. A beat - as everyone visualizes a superFART.
It makes mom fart, too. Mary CHOKES on her food. Drops her fork. She maneuvers, in the allotted space, for the utensil - and finding difficulty. Hancock grabs the table, one arm. Lifts it off the carpet and above everyone's head. Mary, startled, impressed, all of the above. She picks up the fork.
Good arm.
not about the labor... or the love of it.  .It's about responsibility... with what is empowered in you. The gift of might. Might to.do what? Exploitation, because you can? Or a different path. To purvey justice. To correct the ills of man... because I can. Faces of profound confusion - Mary and Aaron. But they are charmed, his words secondary to his charisma. Horus, the quiet observer, observes.
What line of work are you in, Mr. Longfellow?
 Oh, it's not like you... what you do or anything. A department store over on Third.
Horus is in the securities business.
I'm a security guard. I'm just...
It's a large department store, over a couple million in merchandise... stereos, jewelry. On three floors.
It's a night job. I sit around.
You're a security guard. You keep the state of things. It's a job. You do it.
Aaron, could you show me the restroom? Aaron points first door in the hall.
On the right. He leaves to find bladder relief - leaving Horus to his family.
What do you think, mom?
 Horus, what do I do?
 I need to get ready.
mom?
 What do I do with him... when you're gone? I have to entertain this super... She doesn't finish her... A NOISE interrupts her - seizes the participants.
 and you could see the flames, through the storm... I get there, the vessel's all over, spread across three miles of South Pacific. Bodies floating in the water, shoes, kids who'd thought it some routine reconnaissance joyride. Turns out, the only one alive was the captain, up against a buoy... crying 'cause he didn't go down with his men... and he's got to live with it.
 I wanted to kill him.
Aaron.
I want to deck him, just once. So bad I tense up... like I can't even move.
 He comes home crying.
Did not. Not crying. It was pissed-off.
Oh, I... you don't have to leave. I don't want to interfere. I have work.
 Oh, I forgot to make coffee. She rushes into the kitchen. Horus stops her.
It's all right, Mary. I'm late.
No, I'll make it right now.
I don't have time. I'll grab some on the way. Thanks. Mary accepts it - not entirely guilt-free.
No, I need to go.  The last time I had a meal... an evening like this, I was... it was too long ago. I appreciate your kindness.
Aaron. Tomorrow. After the bell. I'll drop by after school. See how you're doing.
Need a lift?
It's a short walk. Acknowledged. An awkward beat while they stare at each other... . until finally, they go their separate ways - Horus via walk and Hancock, with effortless grace,, via flight. From the sidewalk and awe-stricken - Horus watches Hancock merge into the blackness. A look of dread squats on his face.
No.
. won't blow me...
Shit stinks.
says I'm keeping poontang on the side.
D'fuck she know? Shit smears, man.
Games. I don't need it.
Fuck games, fuck dames.
I got a'wife, I don't need the aggravation...
Take a donut hole. The entrance. Horus wanders in, lost in this environment. He finds the front counter. The cops watch him.
A cup of coffee, please. Holly takes the order. Leaves to fetch it.
Longfellow.
 How are you, John?
 Observe anything worth recording, lately?
You know... things are slow.
Not for Samsone Electronics on fifth. Got hit on Thursday.
The guard, he was cut-up like a piece of meat.
Anything go wrong, you make sure you notify us, the authorities. No heroics without a license. You know the procedure. Horus - he knows the procedure.
Of course he does.
Of course. Holly returns with the coffee. Hands it to Horus - free of charge. From the back, Soon-yi intervenes...
He no have gun. Not copper.
Oh, I thought...
He regular guy. Sixty-five cents for regular.guy. Horus - somebody shoot him.
What're you doing? She's taken by this scene.
 Thinking. Mary goes over to the bed. Sits.
About him?
No. Not really. Are you?
No. They're lying through their collective teeth.
Me neither. I was thinking.., about tomorrow.
Go to sleep. You know what dad says. Tomorrow always feels better...
I know, mom... after a good night sleep. He says that but he's the one working every night. Does that mean he never feels better? He's always feeling terrible?
Mom? She turns.
 .the trains seemed imminently bound for a catastrophic collision when this... this superguy...
From here, we can SEE her - entering from the hallway. She disrobes down to bare back... And from this darkness, the RED tip of a burning cigarette GLOWS into view. Hancock watches from here, the cigarette BLAZES back towards his face intense.
. we remain undaunted... but the WAILS of suffering continues... until we get there, there in a clearing as smoke and debris settle... and we see the remains of a lake, a,lake full of BLOOD... of mangled BODIES floating like flotsam... WOMEN and
. we SCREAM!
Olga... He snaps out of it...
 Another dream?'
I was talking again, huh?
. that look on her face, you know the look, when she's almost there... makes you feel like a man.
Roheim.
Come on.
 Walk with me.
Have a good one.
I got to do what I got to do. She watches him go -curious.
Roheim exits the liquor store, already imbibing from a brown paper BAG. Not a word from Horus.
No.
Sure you do. You disapprove and yet you allow me to drink... to poison myself. Your friend. Without a word of caution. Not a word. Just take it... you take everything.
No.
You're afraid to offend. You don't want to be abrasive. Provocative.  So you suppress. Do nothing. Take it. Roheim takes another gulp.
 You shouldn't drink.
My wife. She left a bad taste in my mouth. I drink to kill-the taste. Horus has no response to this.
 What the hell. I can learn to love beverage.
Hancock. Following. From across the street. Mesmerized and in a world to himself. He crosses. the street, failing to look both ways... BAH! A UPS truck STRIKES the clueless superhero, sending him across air - towards Mary.
Hancock warbles out from the debris - his trenchcoat reduced to mere tatters. He pulls a severed SLEEVE from the rubble. Looks at Mary, reposed before him.
 How are you? In unison, they turn to the UPS vehicle - a .mangled heap of steel, STEAM billowing from its ruptured radiator. Hancock shrugs a smiles.
 Clyde. Can I talk to you for just a brief moment?
What were you doing in the street?  You ripped it pretty good.
didn't see it coming... left myself open.
It'll be all right.
All right?
It's just the seams. I can sew it back.
What?
 This. It's just the seams.'I'll take good care of it.
You'll sew -it?
Yes. Me. I can. And I'll re-button it for you, all right? Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one.
Are you okay? No reply. He stares at her - simply.
 Let's see.
You have to be quick.
Come on, I want to see.
If you blink, you'll miss it. Hancock uncups his hands, releasing a billowy MASS of white something - it hangs in the air, and then dissipates into moisture. It showers into his open hands. Mary reaches for it. Too late.
I saw it, right? A little cloud. She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains. And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain. Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand touches his. He stares down at her hand... at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls her hand away.
The water is dirty.
I'm sorry.
 It's not your fault.
I've been tired, lately.
You should slow down. Rest.
-So people tell me.
 It must be hard.
Hard?
To always do right... do good when all you want to do is rest.
It's harder to not do anything. What am I? It's not for me. It's for... it is about people. Rest? When there is despair? I cannot. I bring relief. I am relief. You know that instant, that split instant of time when you realize that the nightmare... the totality of fear itself... that it's all been a bad dream? That it's safe? That is relief. The infant in my arms... to the hysterical mother. When you can see her face, what's rest? It is self-indulgence. Mary - in some advance stage of "wow."
Where... who are you?
It's not important who I am, Mary. Or what... where I'm from. It doesn't matter. I'm a man. I am every man.
 You probably get a lot of practice explaining yourself, on account of who you are and what you do.
Why... do you say that?
It's like, everything you say sounds... so perfect. Like you rehearse them so they'll be that way. I mean, not to say that it's insincere...
Yes...  sometimes. Mary allows the moment to sink in.
So, you never answered. Back there... what were you doing in the middle of the street?
He cuts into an alley. Looses them momentarily. Finds a DUMPSTER to his liking.
Shit, I'm not climbing this. Just combed my hair. Erlick and Spengler turn to him, through the metal bars. Their eyes are of disbelief.
What's up?  What? Perceval follows their gaze behind him to Aaron, shivering with clenched fists.
 I just combed my hair. Erlick and Spengler make for the fence, to join the fray.
Don't bother. He's mine.  No biting. I hate biting.
Kick his ass, Percy.
Let's go. Let's have it. While we're still kids. Nothing from Aaron - just a lot of balls.
Dick wad, let's go. Come on, you impotent little gonad.
He's yours.
Save some for us. Someone blinks - and Aaron finds himself on the dirt, supine. Perceval looms over him, silhouetted against the sky. He reaches for his zipper, doing that Perceval-thing. A look of recognition in Aaron's eyes - it's going to rain soon. He reacts with knee-jerk reflects, administering a swift kick into Perceval's peeing apparatus. A faint SQUEAL eructs from the fellow's mouth. He drops like a wet tea bag. Erlick. Spengler. Shock. Disbelief. Aaron gets to his feet, ready to book... but he doesn't. He stays.
What's he doing?
Kick his ass, Percy. Aaron stares at them, behind the fence. Then down at Perceval fetal position, mouth agape. Aaron reaches for his zipper ZIP, revenge presents itself.
That's cold.
Kill him, Percy. Aaron cranes himself over Perceval's face, over his open oral orifice. Contemplates his target. Aaron - to pee or not to pee... ZIP. He closes his fly. Steps away.
 Don't mess with me. He struts out of the alley. Shifts into a mad sprint, adrenaline taking him away.
You're still up? She moves behind the bathroom door. Self-conscious.
Just get in? Mary steps out of the bathroom, buttoning up her domestic attire. She nods affirmatively.
Nick's market. Are you sick?
I can't sleep. She goes to the bed. Palms his forehead with her right. Palms her own with the left, as reference. Horus tilts his head away from her hand.
Please, Mary.
You want some milk? I'll heat it up for you, how about that?
No thank you.
Yes, he is. He sits there in bed, struggling with the words. Mary continues dressing - oblivious.
He'll take him home?
Yes.
What do we know about this man? The papers... they don't have all the facts about him.
What facts? He's not a hero.
Yes. A hero. I know that...
Aaron likes him.
(notices Mary, applying
Are you going somewhere?
No. I have to start on dinner. So how about that glass of milk? Horus - shakes his head, annoyed.
All right. Try to get some sleep. With that, she's out the door. Horns alone in bed, staring into the vanity mirror at his wretched face. He spots a brown paper BAG on the chair. Goes to inspect. Inside - Hancock's tattered trenchcoat. Oy, what does it mean? Horus returns to bed, distraught. He buries himself under the cover.
.o his mouth was. open and he just stared up at me, it hurt that bad. And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers through his hair - a mother grooming her child. Meanwhile, Horus listens concerned.
"Don't mess with me." Mom, remember that guy in the cop movie... he said that?
All right, already. How's your mouth?
It doesn't hurt, I told you.
 He said tomorrow, he'd pi ck me up again...
I thought maybe you'd like it -- if I pick you.
God, my friends will freak. Horus freezes - fades back to his meal, unheard.
Horus pauses to acknowledge the photograph. He closes the closet door.
Hold still.
I like it long.
Shut up.
Horus?
it's almost eight. Dad's late.
Horus? She brushes hair off her apron. Moves into the living room, the bedroom - no husband. She goes to the front door. Opens it into the stairway outside. There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way up. Mary sees him... and they look at each other.
like this?  How do you make a fist?
 Aaron, hold it. Hancock shoves his fist up close, almost between the boy's eyes. So there it is, the fist - this petrified mass of knuckles and bones. It SNARLS at Aaron. Hancock holds it there, fingers locked together - like he can't let go of them. Aaron swallows - in awe. Mary watches her guest, the change in him.
Hancock? The sound of her voice takes him. He snaps out of it.
) turn. Hancock, it's yo ur
What?
Your hair. Come on, have a seat.
Mom's going butcher your hair.
Shut up, kid. Hit the showers. And the n homework.
Oh, mom. I want to talk to him. Tell her, Hancock. Hancock shrugs a "what can I do."
Yeah, right. I know. I got to do what I got to do.
Erected before us, the immediate product of a mediocre haircut - he looks plain and un-super. He looks... goofy.
There... my hero. He inspects himself via a hand MIRROR. Smiles. Politely.
Nice. Thank you. Mary - peripatetic, putting away things...
I started out just trimming for Horus. Here and there. He had to look just right for the academy, says his father, a police captain there... in Philly. When we moved here, I pretty much took over as the resident barber. You know, to save some money.
He was in the-police academy? A pause.
His father's idea. Not his. He went through it anyway, like he had something to prove... the validation of his manhood.
Is that what you want?
Want?
What you need?
The hair... I need to...
Mary?
Yes?
Why... what for? They're eye to eye. Close.
Mom? Mary bursts from her perch - regroups, awkwardly. Aaron stands in the hallway, his hair still wet from the shower.
Yes. Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock? Nah!
my mouth. It's starting to swell. I think he loosened a tooth. Mary - maternal duty calls.
All right. Go to your room. I'll get the ice pack. Aaron exits. Mary exits. Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for the front door. Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him...
You're leaving?
It's getting late.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to take a walk.
Really? On the boardwalk?
Maybe. Pause.
Mom.'
I'm sorry. She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought.
Good night.
I wear dresses. How about you?
 Get lost. The warning comes across quite well - the man exits. Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the other end, the bar fly rises. Pays. Heads pass them, for the door.
 Meet you outside. The El Camino, right? The bar fly nods. Exits. Gina turns to Hancock. Takes his face in her hands, studies him.
Your eyes are calm. It's good. She withdraws her hands.
What?
But you're still here. She rises. And as she makes for the exit...
Nice haircut. Hancock watches as the night swallows her whole. He inhales the rest of his cigarette - pensive.
Dear God. Horus catches him.
Jesus. Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels. Comes back to nurse' the wounds.
Figured I can get you by the front... but you weren't there.
 Who... what happened?
They-jumped me. That bastard Scarpo and his boys. They were waiting on me. Returns to get more clean towels. And comes back.
Why didn't you come through the back... standing out there in the dark?
-Couldn't find my keys. Must've dropped them'in the fight.  Shit... He works himself off the chair. Heads inside the bathroom.
What're you doing?
 the old man Look at what they did.. gave a fat lip to match his big mouth. I'm for shit.
I'm a waste of time...
Stop.
I'm too old for this.
You're not old.
What am I... I'm biologically challenged. Any way you look, I'm a waste of effort.
Horus looks away. Doesn't want to hear it.
got to do what you got to do. He paces with nervous energy, pounding his fist into the other hand. We sense a decision brewing...
I know you're up, Mary. I know you can hear me. Please meet me on the boardwalk tomorrow morning. Nine o'clock. It's important that I talk to y ou, then.
They're going to can me.
No one's canning anyone. No one saw us... watch your step... leave.
Should be an extra key over the door.
Mary appears a bit frazzled, handing her son toasts. She rushes back to the stove - her eggs beckoning.
The toast's burnt.
What? Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox.
We're late... you forgot the corn chips. Mary serves up-the eggs - sunny side up. 1. and down... and all over the place.
Eat... and we'll go.  Where's your father? She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair.
You forgot the corn...  . ouch!
I'm'sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy'll be home before we leave. I'm sorry.
You having your period, mom? She responds with a brisk slap to the head... SMACK.
Shoes. The two pause. Remove their shoes. Proceed into bedroom.
You're going to be okay?
I don't know. You might have solo act tomorrow night.
Get some sleep.
You're a good man, Horus.
 I have to get home, now. I'll call. Roheim grabs on to his sleeve.
You know what Olga said before she walked out on me? Her last words to me. She turned at the front door. Looked around the room and she says, "keep it clean." That's it, can you believe it? Then out the door.
He fidgets in his spot - courage evaporating with every elapsed second. Until finally, Horus is a pile of dung. The door opens. And Clyde emerges, tall and ugly. He's holding up his pants with one and the SPORTS PAGE with the other. Caughtin mid-defecation, he is none too happy.
The box scores are waiting and I got an inch of meat sticking out of my ass. Make it snappy.
 I'd like my sports page, please.
You what?
I want you to stop taking my sports page.
All right. Clyde closes the door. Horus - thunderstruck. He stutter-steps... KNOCKS...
You what?
That there... my sports page.
What's gotten in to you? All of a sudden? You don't even like football. Horus does.not budge.
No.
What?
No. I would like my sports page now. Please.
After I finish.
I'd prefer it now.
What's eating you, Longfella? You crazy? Without warning, Horus wrests the sports page from Clyde's arm a kamikaze move, indeed.
Why'd you go and do that for? Clyde belts up has pants. Roles up his sleeves.., and the massacre commences. He simply tears into Horus... SLOWS to the stomach... RIGHTS across the face. It ends quickly and without resistance - as if Horns accepted it as fate.
Are you all right, mom?
You're acting weird.
 What?
I'm late for class. Go home, mom. I think it's time for your nap. Aaron leaves. Pensive, Mary begins her walk... to the boardwalk.
Mary! A deaf ear. No one's there to console him. He storms out of the apartment.
Up against the railing leans Hancock, and the remains of a cigarette. His hair drips of salt water - he's been here a while, one would suspect.
Come back here! Stop him! In the background, a COP commences pursuit on a THIEF. The thief dashes by - pass an indifferent Hancock. The cop follows suit, passing by.
Stop him! Hancock - his gaze wavers not from the distant waters.
Drink. The bartender comes out, considers this man's appearance.
Please.
Hi.
Is everything all right?
(constipated; following some
It's cold. Mary and Hancock - we notice, they look good together.
 They're moving. The turbulence has started.
Tell me what's wrong. He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into darkness.
Look out there and what do you see, Mary?
see it,can It's out there. But you can't Y nu?  And that's good, not seeing. But for me, I've seen it. It's where I'm from... out there.
Please, Hancock. What are you talking about? What's out there?
Duty.  You ask a man, Mary, and he'll tell you. He'll say: "you do what you have to do." Or what? You let the next guy do it for you, if you don't... if you can't.  And... but. If I can't, then who?
The next guy? No. There is no "I can't." Just "I must." Mary - watching a grown superman unravel.
Hancock... what...
I just want to let go, Mary. Or I'll break. I need to get away. Get away to where? I don't know.  I need your help.
Me? What can I do?  What do you want me to do?
I want you to save me.
How? Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And kisses her. Their lips lock, twisted and entwined... until Mary, composing her senses, pulls away.
Don ' t.
I can't.
You can. 
Mary,-I'll take you away. And Aaron. what... I'll quit. Get a real job. An apartment. I'll flip burgers. I don't know what I'm doing... what I'm saying anymore.
To whom?
I love him. The death blow.
No.  Unacceptable.
I love him. I'm sorry. One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel. Mary wants to console... but what can she do?
I'm cold. Mary hands him the contents of the bag - the trenchcoat.
I'm sorry.
And that's the cue for the adjacent stalls - arms like tentacles surface from below, shackling Aaron in his spot. He can't see but, from behind, the stall door opens... Guess who? Perceval - possessed. He grabs the back of Aaron's head. Introduces it to the yellowed waters below. SPLASH - the head goes in, submerged. What Aaron sees for the next several seconds: yellow, the thrashing of.bubbles, the shine.-of white porcelain at.intimate range. What he hears: the GASPING of his own breath, GURGLE, and wicked laughter. The ambush ends. Perceval. Erlick. Spengler. One of them says...
 Little shit. Left there and in the stall - Aaron, slumped against the bowl. On the tile floor. A wet rag of piss.
She runs down the hallway to her bedroom, seeking solace in Horns. The cold, empty bed says he hasn't been home.
Horus...
 Hymie. Come down, Hymie. She catches Hancock, Mr..Superhero who can fly, stumbling by.
 Holy fuck. Hancock resumes his course, taking off and into the wet sky.
What do we have here? A piece of shit. A slow look of recognition seizes his face - this is that superguy. Hancock stares at him.
 Hi.
 What're you doing here?
 I saw you walking. Where were you today? You said you'd... be there. Hancock - looking over Aaron's abused frame.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Where are you going? Can I go?
You don't want to go where I'm going.
Those assholes got me in the bathroom, today...  and you said you'd pick me up at school. Hancock turns. He's upset now.
Listen. Aaron recoils.
No, not my job. Don't put that on me.  Not my problem. Not on my shoulders. Deal with it, kid. You are what you are and... what I say, it won't do you any change. You'll grow up to be just like-your old man. A coward. Not a damn thing you can do about it... 'cept grab both ankles, hope by the grace of God the reaming's gentle. Aaron backs away from his angry wrath.
No... nevermind.  Where's your bathroom?
 Bathroom's closed. Horus politely stands'- teeters a bit.
How much.
Thank you.
The register ain't open yet, anyhow. Horus doesn't hear him. He's already on the move, making a dash for the door. But too late - he VOMITS at the front entrance.
Shit.
I've been waiting. They stare for one horny beat. Hancock moves into her. Buries his head into her bosoms, looking for solace. She takes him in, very maternal this Gina.
Come on, baby. Relax.
I can't.
You can. The phone begins to RING - but they're busy.
I can't.
Let it go, baby. Just let it...
 I can't. His arm rips through the glass...
. go.
I can't!
He DRILLS a hole into the phone - killing it.'
Don't give up, now. He lets her down. Tears out of the booth. Finds the sky.
They sit without talking.. They eat without making a sound. Between them - a ketchup bottle. The door bursts wide, coughing up Horus. He locates his chair and plops on it... misses... kisses the carpet.
 Son. Go to your room. Struggles to his knees.
What happened toyou?
Dad, are you wasted?
Where... Aaron, he's not wasted. Go to your room.
He is wasted. Horus rises, under great difficulty. Feels his way to the sofa. When Mary tries to assist, he waves her away.
Aaron. Go to your room.
But dad...
What do you think you're doing, Horus Longfellow? Horus gauges her.
Don't "Horus Longfellow" me, Mary. I'm not your child. I'm your husband.
Horus, what're you talking about?  Who did this to your face? Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength.
Why do you say that?
Because I let you down.
L are. Did You're a fool, that's what you you think I was completely blind when I married you? Something cuts at your masculine ego and it's the pressure... the standard's unreasonable. The woman, she wants me to part oceans. That's the kind of bull shit's made of. I went w through it...,I was there when the hurt came, when the academy said no. I there. And when you felt like hiding... from me and your ownforward. taking Rent job, I stepped It was you, Horus Longfellow. otile. I didn't take the love away. here. the closet, Horus stands there - tears, almost. He takes to his security retrieving his U-Rent Security Jacket. He grabs hat. Straightens his hair. Puts it on.
Horns, what are you doing? Inserts the flashlight into his holster.
All that I can do. the frontdoor. And with that, stumbles out of
Horus!
It comes from a BED g twrithingNintherrposit onI over obscured from view, iearidin s 1 he can. a Hancock. She's doing the best
Come on, baby. What's... wrong? The picture of Ted "the police captain" Brock succumbs to the rattle. It DROPS off
A woman's VOICE says...
What's the matter?
I need a cigarette.
You what? But you haven't...
 I need a cigarette, goddamn it! He storms from the bed. Heads for the bathroom.
I don't smoke. What's wrong with you? She rises after him and into view - it's no other than the TV reporter, in the flesh. She bounces over to the bathroom, as the door SLAMS shut.
What're you doing?
And in disgust, he swipes EVERYTHING off the sink.
What're you doing, in there! I'm calli ng the police. Hancock drops his pants. Straight-arms the wall with his left. And with his right, latches on to his magnanimous member. Outside and beyond the door, the reporter has her ear pressed against wood - listening. So there our superhero stands, bent over a bit, yanking up a storm. His body convulses under said stimulation. He GROWLS... Cue for the reporter to back away.
Jesus... Hancock stiffens, in full throttle. Full. Throttle... up and into a fevered pitch... and BOOM, we hear a He GROWLS... P baby explosion. The reporter leaps back. Beat. The bathroom door flies open. Hancock emerges, buttoning his pants. He brushes pass her. Finds the window... and he's off with a gush of wind. The reporter turns back to Looks ins everywhere, in shambles.. nwke . b nd in the ceiling,da.9apings HOLE - seething still fro S m the l A aunch.
Shit.
Scream and I blow...  oh shit. Hancock in a foul mood. He brushes the Hoodlum away, sending flesh and bone against the opposite wall. SNAP goes the landing. The Hoodlum. Dead. Hancock - realization. He hastens to the body... limp... broken.
No... don't. No.
 "Once there was a way, to get back homeward..."
once there was a way, to get back home..." Her voice grips him. Torments him...
"Sleep pretty darling, do no t cry. And I will sing a lullaby..."
Thanks, mom.
Sleep tight. She leaves. Aaron stops her by the door.
Mom. Tomorrow always feel bette r.
Probably.
 Mary. Mary launches back, cold. Outside the window and in frontrof her - Hancock, suspended in air. The blood-red of his eyes p nothing but bad news. And being so, he EXPLODES through the glass. Glass rains through trance. n the kitchen, amplifying his e
 Amway, anyone? The pursuit commences - Hancock steadies after Mary, in retreat around the living room.
 What're you doing? Hancock closes in. Corners her.
It's the haircut, Mary.  I'm pissed! Out of nowhere - Aaron charges the caped psychotic. He trampolines on Hancock's back, trying to saddle him.
Don't you fucking touch her! Mary SCREAMS. Hancock cringes, says...
Shut your mouth. He swats the kid off his back.
Don't touch her you bastard!
You're getting on my nerves.
Hancock, please. He reaches down and untangles Mary from her son - she concedes out of fear for Aaron.
No! Mom!
Stay back, Aaron! Hancock takes her away - like booty. Aaron dangles from his cape, trying to save his mother.. In vain. The superhero springs into the night - with his woman.
EMPTY_LINE
Horus takes refuge behind the locker, allows them to pass.
Police?
What're you doing?
What I got to do.
Nutri-cop.
He got out.
He's dead, man.
Fuck, we're dead! What, now?
You did the right thing, Longfellow.
Take a hike, Longfella. Get back in your hole and watch the law kick some ass. Horus, reluctant, returns inside his building. Rutgers moves to work the speakers - his action preempted by the other COPS.
We got something big going down.
 Killybegs Textiles. The Cap sounds like he's chewing the rag.
Fuck, what do we do with this?
This is a wrap. Come on, lets roll! All units.
I don't like the smell of this shit.
What the...
They're taking off...
Fucking no way.
 Check this-out, fellas. Scarpo. Thug #1, #3. They gather around - watching the woman reporter do her thing, at the scene.
blocked off the streets. Already, orders for more substantial fire power have been requested by the commissioner's office as police surround the condemned textile building in an all-out confrontation with Hancock, superhero- turned-renegade...
Fuck, you guys know what this means?
We're off the hook, man.
The store's ours.
What about that security guy?
He ain't coming back? In unison - their FLASHLIGHTS flick on.
Rutgers and Adams arrive. They take position next to fellow
What's with the Cap? Looks like someone just fucked his wife, or something. Nervous smiles from the fellas.
Take the show upstairs.
 Behind you! Thug #3 swings around with a Louisville Slugger - it swipes the 45 from Horus's hand. Horus "I'm screwed." Thug #3 promptly knocks Horus against the BAT rack. Bats roll, spray the floor. Thug #3 slips hard on his approach, landing heavy on his head. Thug #2 comes running, gun raised.fa rusCdives for r a goes oose bat, his swing greeting Thug #2 in the the count. Horus stands over the two bodies - as surprised as we are.
Guys?  Fuck me. He drops his loot. Heads for the second floor, cocking his gun.
again, we believe that this is a hostage situation. Officials refuse to comment but we believe Hancock has abducted a woman, the identity of whom we do not yet know... Horus - a look of horror on his face.
Mary. He's off, slowing to a ginger descent at the stairs. Makes his way down to the second floor... where he is greeted by a gun NOZZLE, pressed against his temple.
You're starting to piss me off. He pushes Horus down the remaining steps.
Your move... Horus uncoils an accurate kick to Scarpo's groin. Scarpo - a dumbfounded look entwined in pain. He drops. Horus goes for the gun. A struggle ensues, Scarpo finding Horus to the side. strength from god knows where. g Takes dead aim with a tremblin BANG... Horus grimaces... Scarpo drops. .45 (knocked from Roheim steps forward from the darkness, the Horus, earlier) smoking in his hand. Did I get him? Horus. Roheim. They look at Scarpo.
What're you doing here. ROHEIM ed Mary called earlier. She was worri about you.
Mary...
Those clouds that shroud the sky a CRACKLE of lightning echoes through the They begin to surge neighborhood. And the rain begins to pour.
Let the lady go, Hancock. Or all hell's going to break loose.
 Does he know anything else?
 Come on out! Hancock seizes his ears the bull horn testing his nerves. He bolts upright, turns to Mary. He seeks a special kind of healing. Hancock closes in - corners her.
Please. But there's no denying this superman - he grabs her, running his hand down her back and between her buttocks.
 No...
Please... A sudden burst of anger seizes Mary. She SCREAMS... STRIKES Hancock across the face.
He tears himself away. Disgusted. Tortured.
 Help me.
 All HELL'S going to break loose! Hancock recoils from this noise - in veritable pain. Clutches his ear.
Make it go away, Mary. Mary huddles against the wall..She watches on, watching him struggle.
You are surrounded. There's no way out of this one... NO WAY OUT! Hancock on his knees, tears bubbling inside. He shakes it off.
No... do what I got to do. He unloads a PUNCH. PUNCTURES brick. Clear through...
Ted Brock - a picture of grim impatience, breathing hard.
I want his balls in a jar... Chad. The others. They take a good look at him.
in a fucking vice...  this is the END of the line.
He drops to a squat, searching for calm.
I'm cold.. Hancock does not respond.
there's NO ESCAPE!
Signal acknowledged. The Rifleman loads his piece...
Where the fuck is Chopper Three?
Fuck the woman, this is Armageddon. I want that bastard in a body bag. Ted waves a "go-when-ready" sign. The Rifleman steadies his high- powered weapon... FIRES...
Go away! Go. Away. The authorities - they pause, startled. They open FIRE. Cops. S.W.A.T. teams. Their cousins. Bullets ZIP through the air and with dead accuracy. Hundreds of shells strike Hancock - the target. They PING off his armor of superFLESH. He stares at them all, invincible.
Let me go you bastard.
Let go, you little asabite. Aaron spots Horus in the hallway...
Dad! He breaks loose - running into his father's arms, crying.
I'm sorry dad. I didn't know what to do...
Mr. Longfellow...
He's got mom, dad. He came and took her away. What do we do, now? Horus - he hasn't a clue. On the TV - a graphic depiction of war at Killybegs.
There's not much you can do. We've got every man out there, already. I suggest you take your son some place safe. Let us do our jobs.
 Mary...
I'm sorry, dad. I'm sorry.
 I have to go... they need me. He exits. Roheim enters, out of breath. He notices the nasty, gaping hole in the kitchen.
He's got Mary, Roheim.  I got to get her.
What do you mean, you got to get her?
I got to do what I got to do. Aaron stares up at his father - "did he just say that?"
Damn right, dad. We got to get her. Horus at the screen - oblivious. "What can I do?"
Brain damage runs in this family or something? Aaron senses his father's state of overwhelmness.
Dad. You ever hear about the fox and the bloodhounds?
Go away!
Jesus, Aaron. I don't want you to be here.
 I need a drink. Aaron, staring at the massacre - a HEAD rolls pass him. It looks pale but well-fed, healthy. It Ted's. Aaron ducks into his father's chest.
Satisfied - Hancock returns inside the building. From the street, we can SEE Horus - fumbling through the rubble, heading towards the confrontation. He'passes a mutilated body - belonging to Adams. A revolver dangles from his fingers. Horus reaches for the gun and stops. He looks around at the vast destruction and realizes that no revolver will do. He continues forth.
What have you dome?
I made them go away.
Mary! Mary responds to her name like a body to sugar.
 The noise...
Mary!
Horus!
Why?!
Please, Hancock. Don't hurt him.  It'll never go away. Hancock responds to "it."
You ready to rock it up? Horus runs - he runs for an overturned S.W.A.T. VAN. Hancock follows, toying with the man. Horus disappears inside.
Come out, you little shit. A pause in action - no reply from Horus.
Are you a man?! Horus answers... He storms out with a ROCKET LAUNCHER. He FIRES it at the unsuspecting Hancock. It's a hit and it BLOWS Hancock against Killybegs Textile. It lodges him inside the brick structure.
Fuck you. Hancock pries himself loose - enraged beyond imaginable. He GROWLS - looking to retaliate. But there's no Horus. Hancock explores the rubble - by the building. A sudden EXPLOSION rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall loose, sending it crashing down.., on Hancock. CRUNCH, the concrete rips right pass Hancock - stuns but does not subdue him. He shakes off the dirt. Finds Horus down the street. Like a rocket, Hancock heads that way. He gets there, over Horus - grabbing him by the collar. With a swift flick, he sends the family man flying. THUD as his body careens off the Killybegs wall. He drops to the asphalt below. Horus - in pain, something broken possibly.
Mary SCREAMS in the background... Horns. Hancock. They turn to witness the de-physicalization of Killybegs Textile. they begin to crumble, weakened by the wear Bricks... beams... and tear of recent artillery. Mary braces herself as the floor beneath begins to give. It slips... she SCREAMS... and collapses, taking the rest of the building with it. A CRASH, followed by a cloud of billowing smoke. Mary is no more.
Aaron. Roheim. In disbelief.
Hancock - not a word. He stands in comatose silence, looking pale. Horus charges the building in possessed hysterics, trying to excavate his wife - one brick at a time. Roheim meets him there, in an effort to console.
 Come on, Horus. Horus - lost in the pain. He won't listen. Slowly and with a sense of duty, Roheim joins the excavation. He r olls up his sleeve and gets to work. Hancock drops the yield,sign. Turns to the battlefield in his midst... surveys the carnage... A loaded beat. Hancock ROARS - a cry of desperation. He grimaces with defeat. Staggers off. SCREAMS, because what else can he do. Falls to his knees... by a fallen police GUN.
Hancock discards the gun. Breaks into TEARS. Long SOBBING wet tears. He CRIES. He WEEPS. Into his cupped hands. Indeed, a surreal sight. Horus. Roheim. Engaged to the task, brick by brick. Horus works his way down... to a lifeless ARM, protruding from its tomb. He stops.
sometimes when it's dark out, so dark it's black, I'll see HIM. Aaron peers through the open door. His eyes wander inside ever so gently. On the bed there - HIM... Horns.
Some things... you just never forget.
