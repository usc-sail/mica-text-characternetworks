Blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight AT CAMERA, HELICOPTER ROTORS RISE to a DEAFENING PITCH. SUPER:  Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972. Jungle foliage whips in the fierce downdraft as -- 3   "HUEY" GUNSHIP with US Army markings becomes discernible. The chopper lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the wilderness. We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several machine gun positions around the LZ. watch from the edge of the landing zone. We recognize Nico and Fox, now in their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary jungle attire that usually marks a CIA "spook."
touches down. THREE OLDER AMERICANS -- rough-looking, in their mid-thirties, all carrying some kind of medical bags -- disembark into the HOWLING ROTOR BLAST. They hit the ground nimbly, as if they've done it many times before.
You ever see chemical interrogation before?
These assholes are agency?
We're all C.I.A. But these guys are from a page that ain't on the map. Nico in the point,   leading Fox and the three CIT (Chemical Interrogation Team)   men down an unmarked, twisting trail. We see from Nico's   gait that he is athletic, a born leader and totally at home   in the jungle. 11   TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and let us know these guys are way out in the boonies. ZAGON How long till we're across the border? NICO We've been over for the past hour. The group continues along the ridge.
What are you looking at, hotshot?
 Why don't you light a bonfire?
Just drive the taxi, ace.
 They're in there.
I don't trust these yo-yo's. 15   FULL SHOT - BASE CAMP We see Nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position to another, checking the perimeter. We can vaguely hear him ROUSTING the Cambodian lookouts, speaking in dialect.
That's the nice thing about modern technology. You don't have to wait for results.
 Where is it, Charley? You got six tons of our shit -- The prisoner tries to speak, but he's in such torment all that comes out is a blood-curdling wail --
Don't you die on me, fucker -- FOX  What the hell's wrong? ZAGON (throws the prisoner down) This pussy can't hold his liquor.
enters at this point. He takes in the scene quickly, moves to a spot beside the entrance. Zagon doesn't look at Nico, but it's plain he is aware of Nico's presence. It is as if he wants to prove something to this muscular kid -- and prove it to the others, too.
watches impassively. ZAGON  Where's our load, you sack of slime? What did you do with my shit? -- 27   ZAGON punches  the prisoner full in the face, holding the knife handle  in his fist to double the force of the blow and to terrify  him with the proximity of the blade. The prisoner crashes  sideways, face bloody -- ZAGON I'm gonna teach you good. I'm gonna teach you never to fuck with my opium --
 You're a hard nigger, aren't you, boy? You took it from the Chinks... you took it from the French. You'll be fucked if some Yankee peckerwood's gonna start your gums flapping -- Nico watches Zagon move the knife blade closer to the prisoner.
-- Well, you're gonna chirp for me, tough guy. You're gonna sing like a choir --
What the fuck does this have to do with military intelligence? ZAGON Your orders are 'assist and observe' cherry -- Zagon turns to face Nico --
 Back off, partner -- Zagon turns from Nico. He moves close to the second prisoner, close as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight. ZAGON  I'm gonna start carving at your ankles. We'll throw your feet in that box right over there. Then I'm gonna take off your arms -- One of the CIT men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping it to the ground with his hands. The prisoner still hasn't flinched. He seems as locked into this dance of death as Zagon. NICO (can't take much more) Fox -- FOX Shut up, Nico.
You can disappear as easy as this slope, kid --
Are you crazy?!!  What the fuck's the matter with you?!!! Nico is shaking with rage and fear. He takes several steps away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly. Nico pulls his .45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the hooch -- FOX Nico! NICO I don't cap him now, he's gonna do me later.
I'll cover this. Get back to the L.Z. --  -- I'll fix it! Get out! Get the fuck outa here! The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect, pointing at Nico. The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect, apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The troops, confused, hold up for a moment.
 I'll call for a chopper... get outa here!
Mama, look at this -- all done by hand.
Nico had one just like this.   Thank you, Cora. Cora, an aunt, proudly smiles.
I think we got a little problem here.
 I carried him for the last nine months, you take him for the next diaper.
 That's what you get for not marrying a Sicilian. Sara lets Nico struggle a moment, then takes over.               *
My brave husband. He's not afraid of thieves and muggers, but he's terrified when his son poops in his pants. Toscani relatives look on with approval at the happy couple and their baby.
 Toscani holds the record... for havin' more relatives under federal indictment than any other cop in Chicago.
Look at these stiff dicks. A free meal and they come out like flies. 37   STREET OUTSIDE NICO'S HOUSE - DAY
Eight more days, Lieutenant. You better start preparing your defense.
Baby, I'm gonna put you on retainer.
You passed the bar? I make it a point never to pass the bar. Jackson sees Nico and Sara across the yard, waves and          * starts toward them -- 39   BACK TO BRANCA AND LUIGI
Now this cop.    She can bust me any day. 40   NICK, SARA AND ROSA                             * Jackson comes up, makes a theatrical appreciation of Nico's stylish attire, kisses Sara and greets Nico's mom warmly.      * She starts oohing and ahhing over the baby. 41   VARIOUS SHOTS
Look at this little bundle.    What a cupcake!
You give up being the D.A. and hurry up and find the right fella, Jax. You might have time for one of these yourself.
Nico, will you let the woman catch her breath?
Watanabe!   Say hey, Doc.
You're a father now. Are you gonna take me up on my offer?
I'm happy, Branca.    I like what I do. Branca glances seriously to the other uncles, then, with a smile, pats Nico's cheek. BRANCA Look at this face! Six-foot-four, pretty as the statue of David. And he's a cop! Branca laughs. From a distance, Watanabe watches, missing nothing. Across the porch, Lukich and several other cops observe and try to listen. BRANCA This face should be sticking up from a white shirt. It should be a banker, a businessman, someone who earns a decent living for his family! NICO We're happy. LUIGI Nickels and dimes. Your wife's a woman with class. What did she run -- a ballet school...? NICO An art gallery. BRANCA Same thing. She wants a husband who carries a briefcase, not a shoulder holster. Jackson watches Nico trying to keep his good humor. This is serious stuff, despite the light tone. Branca's eyes meet Nico's.
You wanted to get shot, you got shot. You wanted to get knifed, you got knifed. You've had your fun. Basta! Enough! UNCLE GUISEPPE Let your family help you, Nico.
 Uncle Gio, that kind of help I don't need. I'd rather get shot by someone I don't know. Jackson and Lukich crack up. The others follow.   For the moment, the tension is dispelled.
What are you doing in here, Mama? Go join the party... Nico comes down the hall, tucking in his shirt -- stops to give his mother a squeeze. O.S. from the bedroom: the sound of QUIET SOBBING. Nico glances in. Sara and another woman sit on the bed, comforting a 60-ish   * grandmother Zingaro, who is crying. Nico comes in. He kneels before MRS. ZINGARO, concerned.
Mrs. Z.  Is this a way to act on the day of my son's baptism? The poor woman can't meet Nico's eyes.
It's Lucy.   She's gone again. Nico glances from Sara to Rosa.                              *
It's that kid from the bar on Damen? The one with the drugs?
Listen to me, Mrs. Z. Are you listening? (as the woman nods miserably) I have to go to work now. But I'll come by tonight. You'll be at the bakery? MRS. ZINGARO Si, Nico. NICO We'll talk, okay? We'll find a way to take care of this.
 Unit Ten Tango X-ray.    We're up and clear.
I promised the Lieutenant, I'm gonna take care of you. Broken windows and lost kittens for your last week. WIDEN SHOT to include Nico and Jackson.
And then you're gonna come visit me in a nice, clean, air conditioned office --
I gotta take a quick leak. Stay put.
Gentlemen. One Jacket treats him like he doesn't exist, and begins to pick his nose. FIRST ARMY JACKET  I thought this was a kosher bar. They didn't allow no pork in here. The two others snicker, then so does the rest of the bar. Nico holds out a photo of a young girl . NICO You seen this girl? SECOND ARMY JACKET I seen the top of her head. NICO That's witty.
Come on.   Show me something. No one moves.
I get it.   It's a gay bar.   Is that it?
You seen the top of her head, huh? Like I seen your mother's --  Or was it yours?  Or yours? (slaps him fero- ciously) I couldn't tell, it looked like her ass -- Nico rages like a beast. NICO Come on, motherfuckers.    Do it. Do it! One man -- Nico lunges for the Bad Dude, grabs him like he's about to tear his face off -- BAD DUDE Upstairs!  She's upstairs! 4-D! Nico drags the Dude from behind the bar.     Holding him, Nico turns, glowering, to all. NICO You cocksuckers are brave enough with 14-year-old girls. 55A   INT. FLOPHOUSE HALLWAY
 Get outta here. We look in the apartment.
 This ain't your day, kid.
Wait, man.   It ain't like it looks --
That's two years. He jerks the Pimp back, rips open a drawer.    More pills and glacene bags. NICO That's four. (twisting the   Pimp's neck toward   Lucy) She'll get you eight   more. And I'm just warming up   -- Lucy is crying hysterically. Nico flings the Pimp, face          * bloody, toward the open door.                                    * PIMP (to Nico, indicat- ing drugs) Take it, baby. It's all yours -- NICO Get your clothes on, Lucy. PIMP There's money. Three grand in the mattress...  ... I can get ya more --
STUD Hey, sister, what it be?
Don't you fuckin' move.                           *
Let him alone! He's beautiful!
Not when I get through with him. Nico lifts the Pimp by the throat, pins him to the wall.
No, man, wait! I'll give you something! Something big!
Please, Nico!    Don't! PIMP It's huge! I swear it! A shipment... coming in next Tuesday -- NICO Shipment, my ass. PIMP This is square! On my mother's soul! You can't send me up -- Nico glances to Lucy. Half of him wants to tear the Pimp apart, the other half doesn't want to make the poor girl's life any more tragic. Besides, he's a good cop -- and maybe this "shipment" is on the level. PIMP I heard it from a hooker friend of mine. She's banging some big coke lawyer, he told her. I swear to Jesus!
What lawyer?
I don't know. (sees Nico doesn't believe him) That platinum chola... Carla DeCarlo... she knows. Nico tightens his grip on the Pimp's throat.
She got popped this afternoon. She's downtown. Red dress, lizard shoes --
It's okay, girl. Mama Jax is here.
 That was some leak you took. From the door of the bar, several bloodied heads peek. JACKSON Broken windows and lost pussy cats, huh. Jackson checks out her battered partner.
You're one crazy bastard, Toscani. Nico opens the rear door, helps Jackson ease Lucy in.
We'll get her some clothes and a bath. I'm not bringing her home to her grandmother like this. DISSOLVE TO:
I don't get you, Toscani.  What the hell are you doing being a shitheel cop? With your background? For a long moment Nico says nothing.   Then, quietly, look- ing straight ahead: NICO When I was overseas, I saw some things. Things that eat your guts out. Things that stay in front of your eyes like they were burned in and branded. He turns to Jackson. NICO You can walk away from them, Jax. You can quit, but you know it's still going on. You try something anyway --  -- I know I'm not going to change the world. I can't stop the tonnage coming in, I can't fight the boys behind the desks pushing their buttons --
But maybe here, huh?  Maybe in my own city, my own neighborhood, on my own block -- maybe here I can do something.
That's why I'm a shitheel cop.
You can see your client. As soon as she's through eating her dinner.
Carla... Carla -- I just want the name of your boyfriend -- CARLA I got 200 boyfriends. The hooker, Carla DeCarlo, slaps the box away, cursing in Spanish.
Pinchi cabron, cabeza colon!
 Why can't you sons-a-bitches ever treat someone with a little respect? NICO  Take it easy, sister. JACKSON I ain't your goddamn sister.   We ain't got the same mother, motherfucka. Carla fires one final parting salvo of obscenities, then sags back among the women. Carla starts to cry. Jackson comforts her; Carla responds, lets herself be comforted. CUT TO: Jackson, back in her normal daytime wear, exits a building. She gets into Nico's car.
JACKSON The lawyer's name is Abandano. He's on the third floor. I got a look at him. I couldn't get how he's connected, but according to Carla, he's a lousy lay.
Maybe we can bust him for that. Jackson spots something, gestures subtly out window --
That's our stud.
Jackson and Nico watch Abandano and the woman pass the        * crowd of demonstrators and enter the building. Jackson acts * indifferent, almost frustrated; Nico keenly senses something. CUT TO:
 -- I brought you in for your muscles, Nardo, not your mouth.
 I'm sorry, boss.
Your English is getting good... You're showing it off. Showing it off on the street --
I keep quiet.    I never talk no more --
Make yourself useful. (indicates empty wine bottle on table) Get downstairs, bring me one of these. (as Nardo stands, starts for back hallway) Then get back to work.
 I thought I was dead, man. (whistles with relief) I thought I was fucking dead.
You were right, cabron.                            *
 Clean up this mess. CHI CHI                                  * Who knows who else is talking --                       *
He was a young fool.                                   * 76   BACK IN UPSTAIRS DINING ROOM Salvano and Chi Chi emerge from the basement steps and walk toward their booth.
We're crazy waiting for this bullshit 'shipment.' Let me waste the other fucker now.
Be patient. This will be done the way it was planned. CUT TO:
Toscani, you're going to have me doing time.
Lighten up, Jax. No one's bringing this into court.
Except against us. NICO I don't give a shit how we do it. I just wanna get there. Jackson gives Nico a dirty look, but stifles her protest.
I thought you said you were gonna protect me. Cover my butt. Be my guardian angel -- Nico hears something through the earphones.    Gestures for silence -- 80   ANGLE THROUGH OFFICE WINDOW Chi Chi listens with increased intensity to something on the phone. He starts writing it down -- 81   BACK TO NICO In unmarked car.   He's writing it down too. NICO I got the shipment.                                  * JACKSON What?    What's he saying?
 '... Engine block has cleared customs. Serial number VA-748. Pick up Tuesday, 3 May as authorized.'
Unit Ten Tango X-ray. I need a vehicle registration I.D.
Go ahead, please. NICO '86 Lincoln.    Illinois 354 Dog '67.                *
Salvano? NICO Jackpot.
Two for dinner?
Two for drinks. They elbow up to the packed bar, standing.   Nico squints toward the rear dining room.
You'll have your engine block next Tuesday, boss. 93   BACK TO NICO AND JACKSON
Why couldn't it be a week from Tuesday? I could read about it in the paper. Nico grabs her waist, pulls her onto the dance floor, and does a playful twirl.
Cheer up, partner.   I'm gonna make you famous.
You missed a few spots, boys. LUKICH I'm takin' it home t'a make kilbasa, boss.
This ain't a bust -- it's a convention. NICO Don't you like company, Luke?  We got all the scouts here -- Drug Enforcement Agency, the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms -- WALKIE-TALKIE Keep this channel clear, Toscani. We realize Nico, Jackson and Lukich are wired, with mikes out of sight under their coats. Nico glances to the pick- up, near to which three men can be spotted in the alley. Apparently one of them is the walkie-talkie voice. NICO  This is our channel, dickhead. And our collar. ANOTHER WALKIE-TALKIE That's enough, all of you! Keep this channel clear.
All right. Everyone get their heads outa their ass.
 '... And so I quit the police department... got myself a steady job -- ' The van accelerates slightly, turns a corner, vanishes. Silence. LUKICH                                * They spotted me. I'm too good- looking to be a meat slopper.                       * 1ST WALKIE-TALKIE Will you hot dogs shut up? The van returns.   On a cross street.   Heading behind the packing plant.
* You're too ugly.
 Here we go, boys and girls --  You stay put.                                       *
 It's going down now. Move! The station wagon men heave their rear door open, the van men start to open their side door. The Lincoln is stopped at a distance. Suddenly -- 104   NICO AND LUKICH burst from the rear door of the packing plant, guns drawn. LUKICH Police! 105   QUICK CUTS - VAN AND STATION WAGON MEN grab for their weapons --
 Nico!   The Lincoln!
starts to PEEL OUT. We glimpse Chi Chi in the driver's seat, Salvano on the passenger side.
steps in front of the accelerating Lincoln, raises his .45.
brazenly steps up onto the hood and dives, grabbing onto the roof. Salvano can't believe it. He screams something in Spanish. He FIRES again, this time through the roof. Bullet holes appear.    Nico narrowly misses being hit. 116   ANOTHER ANGLE - LINCOLN
leaps off the roof pulling Salvano past the broken glass, out of the window.
 How many kilos you got in there, Skivuzo? Salvano couldn't answer if he wanted to. The other cops look at Nico with awe. Lukich whips the van door open, yanks a tarp off the cargo. The engine block sits in a wooden shipping frame, wrapped with industrial plastic. Nico climbs into the van, rips the plastic sheeting off, grabs the wood slats of the shipping frame, tears them off. In the background, ambulances are arriving to care for the wounded cops and criminals.
What kinda fuckin' high is this? CUT TO:
-- I'll tell you what this cop is. He's a fucking menace!
You see what he did to me?!
Your problem is being handled right now, Mr. Salv -- SALVANO Yeah? Well, it shoulda been handled twelve hours ago. I don't know who's running this outfit, but somebody better get his goddamn wires straight! AGENT NEELEY                           *  -- yes, sir... yes, sir, I understand -- SALVANO That maniac should be wearing a number, not a badge. Salvano knows what the call is about. He straightens the tie beneath his bruised neck, assuming the attitude of a respectable citizen who has been unjustly wronged. AGENT NEELEY                           *  -- count on it, sir. Right. You'll have our full cooperation. Neeley hangs up. Glances dubiously to Halloran. Then turns     * grimly to Salvano, Chi Chi and the lawyer Abandano.
LIEUTENANT STROZAH  -- This is no reflection on the work you officers have done. I feel, and the whole department feels, extremely proud of your initiative and gallantry. That "spare me the horseshit" look on Nico's face. He's fuming. Strozah sees Nico's bitter expression. It's on the others' faces too. LIEUTENANT STROZAH As all of you   are well aware, possession of   these explosives is a federal   offense and under jurisdiction   of the F.B.I. Nico's eyes meet Lieutenant Strozah's. There's respect between the two, but it's plainly under a helluva strain. NICO Sir. With all respect to our brothers in the Bureau -- (biting sarcasm; turns to Neeley)                            * -- That's no answer. It's no answer to why one of the biggest dealers in the city is out on the street now, free as a bird!
Keep it in your pants, Nico. These men have a job to do, just like us. Nico stifles his outrage. The other cops exchange glances -- upset and angry. Agent Neeley clears his throat.          *
They've risked their lives. I understand one man is in the hospital.
The tapes too.
 That's my Lawrence Welk collection!
I want everything you got on this one. Reluctantly, Nico hands over the tapes.   The Lieutenant eyes the bugs and wires. LIEUTENANT STROZAH I know you don't give a shit about yourself, Toscani.  But you're gonna put Jackson's ass in a sling, too, with these illegal wires.
What's the story on your partner, Jackson? Did he learn this style or was he born with a brick up his ass? Jackson checks Halloran out. He's black too and, despite herself, there's a certain rapport. JACKSON He has ethics. Unlike certain others on this case.
AGENT HALLORAN His 'ethics' are gonna cost him his badge and his gun.
He bad?
Bad bad.
Is that enough? Can we do something normal now -- like eat lunch?
Anything you say, Jax.   How about Salvano's?
Let it be, Nico.
What... you kept his tape, too? Nico already has it in the PLAYER. We hear FRAGMENTS of the telephone tap from the body shop in Spanish and English. Jackson looks frustrated. Nico listens care- fully to what appears to be the taped PHONE CONVERSATION. NICO Poetry, ain't it?
And now for some dessert.
And that must be Mrs. Sal. So nice to see married couples still in love.
This is your mother's church, isn't it?
Yeah. But I bet she's never seen these boys in the choir. 150    NICO'S POV
Nicola! That can't be you in church without the family!
Father Genarro. The priest seizes Nico's hand warmly, smiles at Jackson.
This must be your partner in crime.  I'm Father Genarro. I saw you at the baptismal party.  What a partner. JACKSON Dolores Jackson (smiling, but impatient) Nico, we gotta go -- FATHER GENARRO No, please --  It's good you stopped by. I have to show you something. Please. The priest begins leading Nico and Jackson. Jackson keeps glancing back out the alley to see Salvano's car slowly driving by.
The rats are getting bigger. NICO When did this happen?
Two nights ago. I didn't call the police.
 It's all right, son. These are friends.
 These are friends.  This is Father Tomassino.
How do you do? Nico shakes the young priest's hand. There is a moment between them as Nico meets Tomassino's eyes, liking what he sees. The refugees are relieved, however, when Father Genarro, Nico and Jackson take their leave. 155   NICO, JACKSON AND FATHER GENARRO
I didn't know this church was a sanctuary, Father. FATHER GENARRO Yes. But, perhaps not such a safe one. NICO How long have they been here?
Too long. At least the kids can go to our school.
Who did it, Father?
Kids, maybe.  Maybe worse. It's not the first time. JACKSON We can have a car check by, every hour.
No... please.    Police frighten these people.
NICO Really, I don't mind coming by.
Tell me, Nico... When was your last confession?
I'm a married man, Father.   I've got no sins to confess.
You're a police officer, you have many sins to confess. JACKSON Amen. Nico and Jackson start off.
 You come back Sunday. I feel better when I see Nicola in church.  You don't show, I'm phoning your mother! DISSOLVE TO: 157   SAME CHURCH - POV FROM WINDOW - EARLY MORNING
Father Genarro! I have you to thank for getting my son back into church!
It's amazing what shame can accomplish.

 We're okay! We're okay!
 Help the others! Help them, Nico!
173   STATUE OF JESUS
 Help each other move outside.   Be calm. From a doorway and a shattered window smoke pours forth. We hear SCREAMS from inside. Nico on his feet, plainly the leader in this moment of terror. Worshippers, shattered and bleeding, pour past him toward the door. Nico grabs a stout-looking church- goer. NICO Call 911. Tell 'em to send everything they got!  Sara, get the baby and Mama                        * outside. Nico starts for the altar where the damage is worst.

arrives.   Nico talks to her, aside. NICO I want a list of everyone that's been treated here today. Everyone. JACKSON Right. NICO Then find those sanctuary people, the ones we saw in the church basement -- As Jackson makes notes.
Find out where they're from, why anyone would want to harm them.
Where are you gonna be?
Just stay near a radio.   I'll find you.
Sara... go down to the car; I'll                    * be with you in a minute. He hails Neeley.                                              *
I need to talk to you. (a glance to Strozah and others) ... Alone. Neeley nods. Nico leads him off the corridor, through a       * fire exit door -- 185   STAIRWELL LANDING The door closes behind them. Nico and the FBI man are alone on the stairway landing. AGENT NEELEY                          *  What the hell is it, Toscani? Without warning, Nico grabs Neeley by both lapels, slams      * him furiously into the wall! NICO You.   That's what the hell it is! AGENT NEELEY                          * Get your goddam hands off me! Neeley tries to shake free; Nico won't let him.               *
You let Salvano walk. AGENT NEELEY                          * Salvano?! Are you crazy?  What does he have to do with this? NICO That was no cherry bomb in there. That was C-fucking-4! (struggles to master his rage) I've used that shit. 
I know what it smells like, I know what it blows like --
I want the agent who signed for the explosives.
D)   EXT. BODY AND FENDER SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON The same place where Nico and Jackson wire-tapped Chi Chi. Nico interrogates the shop boss, several workers. All shake their head, gesture emphatically. Salvano not here. E)   CUT BACK TO MORGUE - JACKSON
We ain't gonna shoot you, man. We gonna beat you to death. You gonna learn what it means to 'get down.'
Fly, baby! 194   NICO
 No, hermano. Please --
Who put up the money? MACHETE MAN What money?
You didn't come after me for a piece of ass. (twists the youth's neck) Who paid you?
I told ya!    No one! Nico slams him with a fierce shot to the ribs. The hood doubles over, gasping. The flower girls shriek even louder. Nico turns to the girls with a ferocious glare. NICO  Shut up! The girls instantly go silent in terror. Nico turns back to Machete Man, spins him violently face-down, jacking the punk's right arm straight out behind him. We see that Nico can break his elbow with one blow. NICO Give it to me! Nico raises his fist to strike.
Jimmy Constanza! Nico shoves the hood into the ground, tearing the hood's wallet from his trouser pocket. Nico rips the wallet a- part, seizes the kid's identification and holds it up. He grabs the punk by the hair with his free hand. Machete Man is staring up in terror, wondering what this means.
If you're lying to me, I'll come and kill you right in your own fucking kitchen.
Salvano!   Bautista Salvano!
Gracias, muchacho. Nico walks away.
 I can't sleep. Will you come and hold me?
Of course I will. I've been waiting to hear from Jax. She was supposed to get back to me by now.
Thank God you couldn't find your shoes. We would of have been sitting in the front row.  Alright, I know the rules -- I don't ask you don't tell. But could've died today and I deserve to know.  Why did we go to church this morning? NICO I'm willing to break   the rules; I'm willing to tell   you whatever I know. But I need    some time. Could you just give   me some time? Nico leans to kiss her, but is cut off by the HARSH RING of a PHONE. Sara starts at the sound. She and Nico glance at each other -- SARA I'll bet that's her. Nico picks up the phone.
 This better be good, Jax.
 It's bad, Nico.
 Long time, Nelson.
You should know not to use a name on an open line.  I'm gonna talk for fifteen seconds, then I'm getting off. You're in trouble, Nico. 204   BACK TO NICO'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
 Serious, serious trouble. Take your wife and family and get them someplace safe now. 205   BACK TO STREET - PHONE BOOTH - LATE NIGHT FOX You hear me? Now. I'm risking my ass by telling you this. Good luck, kid. 206   BACK TO NICO'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT The PHONE CLICKS DEAD. Nico tries to keep a casual ex- pression. Sara sees through it -- she knows he's shaken.     * SARA                                 *  That was Fox, wasn't it?
He just wanted to make sure we got his Christmas card.
No, you won't. I'm gonna give it to you.
 This is ridiculous -- there's no need for this! NICO It's all right, darling.
 Who do you think you are -- coming in here like this, treating my son like a criminal? SARA                                    * Why are you terrifying us? There's an infant here! Nico pulls on a jacket. He looks like he could kill.    He restrains himself for his family's sake. AGENT HALLORAN  Check that coat.
Get your hands off him! Rosa grabs Sara --                                              *
 It's all a mistake, Sara -- It's                      * gonna be all right. The cops steer Nico toward the door.
 The Police Association's got lawyers for this, you bastards!
Illegal wiretaps. Unauthorized surveillance. NICO When were you born, asshole? AGENT NEELEY                             * Associating with known felons. Disobeying direct orders --
Where's Jackson?
She's outa this. AGENT HALLORAN You're the rotten apple in this barrel, Toscani. We don't have to look any farther than you and your 'family.'
 Unlawful entry. Illegal search and seizure -- NICO  You'll never build a frame on this chickenshit. AGENT NEELEY                          *  You were ordered to back off on Salvano. But you had too big a hard-on for that, didn't you--
 Fred.   You can't be in on this. Nico faces his lieutenant -- a look that calls on long       * years of comradeship and loyalty. Strozah is torn. He's a good man, over his head in a situation he doesn't com- pletely understand. LIEUTENANT STROZAH                    * You're officially suspended, Toscani. I want your tin... and your iron. Neeley leans past Nico; drops Nico's gun (with an evidence   * tag on it) onto the table. Nico looks to Strozah, who averts his eyes. Nico flips his badge onto the table. NICO You holding me?
Sara, I'm okay. I love you.                         *
Where are you? Why aren't you                       * coming home?                                        *
I'll be home later. Lukich will                     * be there. Tell mama not to worry. Jackson and Lukich are waiting by Nico's car.    They see Nico emerge from the phone booth.
A mood of urgency. JACKSON -- I found the sanctuary people. 
They're refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Chile. They won't talk                  * to me, they're terrified of cops.
Ready for this? One of the people killed at the church was definitely not a congregation member.
JACKSON Alan Singletary. He's an aide to Senator Harrison. Nico is electrified. JACKSON That's right. Harrison. Foreign relations committee. The guy who's been crawling all over the Central American drug connections. NICO  You're gonna make a helluva D.A., Jax. LUKICH God help us.
 I've been at the Tribune all night, wearing out their Xerox machine. Harrison's staff has been compiling some kind of white paper. He's due to release it next week. Nico's mind races.
That's how Fox knew. JACKSON What?
Luke. I  want you to go to my house.  Call Branca... my mother has the number. Get my family ready to move out. LUKICH You got it, buddy.
Stay with 'em. We'll be there. LUKICH What's going on, Nico?   What happened? NICO I got a call last night. An old agency friend. He told me my family was in danger. Jax and Lukich can't put all the pieces together yet.    But if it's drugs-CIA-Senate, it's got to be heavy. LUKICH You got a weapon? Lukich knows he doesn't. He glances up and down the street, makes sure no one's watching -- then cracks the driver's door of his car. There's a bulge in the map pocket. Nico  pulls out a Sig Saur .45. LUKICH Try this on. Jackson watches Luke slip Nico a clip.                         * CUT TO:
 Sister... you know me. Tell them there's no need for fear.
There is rubble all over the yard, Nicola.
 I was there... in the church. They tried to kill my family, too. Several of the refugees look like they want to speak, but they are terrified. NICO I know there was a man here, from an American senator's office. Who was he going to speak to? The refugees become increasingly anxious. NICO  Was it you, senora?  Was it you? More silence.    Glances among the people.   Finally: REFUGEE WOMAN The priest. The others shrink.   The Woman glances to them. NICO Who?  Father Genarro?
The other one.
No. The young one. From Costa Rica.
He came alone... two weeks ago. He had papers. Papers to give to the senator.
But the bomb... The bomb was planted to destroy the pulpit. SISTER BONIFACIA Father Tomassino was going to give the Mass that day.  Father Genarro talked him out of it.
 It was Father Tomassino they were trying to kill.
He run, mister. He go --
If you know where he is, you've got to tell me. I want to help him. I can help him. The refugees lower their eyes. Bonifacia continues her soft weeping. Nico glances to Jackson; her look says "Enough, let's leave these poor people alone." Nico stands, touches Bonifacia one more time on the shoulder --
You're outa this, Jax.    Go home.
 You see this list? Well, I'm not done.
I'm not a rookie, Toscani. Now, go home. Get your family out of here. Nico agrees.    The pair starts to split.
 Just paperwork, you understand?
Nico drives, a jumble of emotions on his face.      Urgency fear, exhaustion. He's deep in thought --
226   FOUR MEN
Over here, you sons-a-bitches! Nico's rage is superhuman. The men stare in conster- nation. One of the men has a fresh magazine half into his weapon --
 Try it. Be my guest.
 Over there! Move it! -- Now!! The men are scared shitless. They put their hands in back of their heads; trot jelly-legged --
Hands on the counter! Three men do it; the fourth is slow. NICO Don't tempt me, ASSHOLE -- The fourth obeys. Nico moves to the pay phone on the wall, covering the men with his .45. He grabs the re-         * ceiver in his free hand; tries to dial. Adrenaline makes his hand shake; the dials spin wrong -- One of the men sees Nico's dilemma. To hit 911, Nico has to take his eye momentarily off his captives. As Nico turns again to the dial -- A free-standing sales display hurtles toward him, crashing into his gun hand. One of the men has lunged into the display; now he dives atop Nico a second later. The whole human pile crashes, thundering into a glass freezer. Somehow Nico gets to his feet. One of the men grabs Nico's gun; Nico swings one of the freezer doors -- Wham! -- smack into the man's face. The GLASS SHATTERS; the man drops like a rock. Now it's three against one -- prime odds for Nico. He wades into his attackers. A coffee stand goes flying. A body sails into a makeup display. One fool is lucky enough to land a blow that bloodies Nico's nose; he pays with a shattered forearm and a head-first heave into an ice cream locker --
Wild-eyed and bloody, sees the cop cars whipping into the corner. He spins to see his .45 on the floor -- too far away to race for. He bolts down a gangway. CUT TO:
 Yeah?
 Get their stuff into the car now. Do it in the alley, not the driveway. I'll be there in five minutes. CUT TO: 241   TWO MORE POLICE CARS
242   NICO - ON SIDEWALK
CUT TO:
Your job and your family in one day, Nico. You're batting a thousand.
 Sara...                                               *
You'll be safe with Uncle Branca. It's gotta be this way... I'm sorry.
Don't you think I'd rather be with you? He holds her passionately.    Rosa coughs loudly in the doorway.
 -- Mama... you got your medicine? Don't forget the baby's sweater --
I know about babies. We glimpse other relatives in the hallway; Nico hands them a pair of suitcases; they hurry off -- SARA                                    * (of Nico's bloodied shirt) You sure you're all right? NICO I am if you are. SARA                                    *  Don't worry --  We needed a vacation, anyway. Sara takes her suitcase, hurries out --                        *
                                      * I'll give you five minutes start.    We have to do it this way. They get their suitcases into the sedan. Mama and the baby are already aboard. Sara gets into the passenger seat.       * Lukich comes around from the front, glancing around like a lookout. NICO Where's Jax?
She thinks there may be documents at some guy's apartment.
You're gonna need help. Nico grabs the pistols, starts to strap them on.
Just stay with my family Nico replaces the piece of foundation, starts back up the steps.
What are you gonna do?
You don't want to know.
250A   EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY We see Uncle Branca's car and Lukich's car out front. Branca leads Nico, Sara, Rosa, Julian and Lukich down a        * corridor. Two older Italian women open a door leading to a basement rec room. BRANCA My sister's cousin's place. You're safe -- not even I can find this joint. The family enters the back room.    They take in their sanctuary.
 Don't forget your seat belt.
Keep walking --  -- I'm bucking for number one.
What can I do for you, lads? Neeley presents his ID.                                       *
Hell, that's gone. NICO When? CLERK Right away, pardner. They scooped that stuff outa here before we even got it tagged. NICO Who?    Who took it?
 C.I.A. Nico reacts, nudges Neeley once more.                         * AGENT NEELEY                          *  We'd like to see the paperwork. The Clerk has an accordion file right under the counter. He indicates a sign-in book.
You gotta sign.
Yeah... I remember that guy. Flew in special from Langley. Bomb tech. Real nice fella -- (finds the form, lifts it from file) -- Here it is. Fox. Nelson Fox.
snatches the release form.     Stares at the signature, stunned.
 -- Here it is, sir. Coming in from Langley now --
 -- That agent has been with the Central American desk, uh, since '84 -- AGENT NEELEY                              *  Thank you. That's what I wanted. Nico takes the mike, clicks it back into its cradle.     Neeley    * freezes, unsure what Nico's going to do with him. NICO  Dump your shoes. Ditch your I.D. on the floor. Nico watches the FBI man obey. NICO So you think I'm a lousy cop, huh, Neeley? Maybe I am. But I haven't got                   * my face buried up Washington's ass. AGENT NEELEY                              * Nobody buys me, Toscani. NICO Yeah? Then somebody pulled the plug on your brain, pal. You didn't come up with the second priest, did you? Or Harrison's dead aide. (as Neeley fumbles with                          * his laces) Hurry up! * You heard the radio. The Agency's pushing buttons and bodies are dropping like flies. You assholes are missing half the case!
Watch your step.
with SCORE and V.O. A)   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY From out of an elevator and down a busy corridor march the brass, Deputy Superintendent Crowder included.       * Lieutenant Strozah lags slightly behind. They enter      * an auditorium where a large contingent of press, cameras ready, wait.
The officer is alleged to be involved in illicit drug trafficking, racketeering and kidnapping --
 Police sources also speculate that Toscani may be connected to the suspect in the bombing of St. Elizabeth's parish church --
 -- the suspect is likely to be armed and considered to be extremely dangerous -- Nico's police ID photo appears on the news.   He blends back into the crowd.
In other news, Senator Ernest Harrison's presidential bid has... Nico moves swiftly through the convention center floor (which is packed for thousands of square feet with sales booths, each manned by technicians and pitchmen, all displaying the latest in high-tech data processing equipment, telecommunications, etc.)
So good to see you again, sir!  Come back near closing... five- thirty... we'll place your order then. Nico nods, fades like a shadow into the throng.     MUSIC DOWN, SEQUENCE ENDS --
Listen, Wat... you know I wouldn't call in a favor --
Of course not. Just because you kept a few 'friendly' tribesmen from cutting my heart out and serving it up as Pad Thai? With a wink, Watanabe escorts Nico into a back area off the floor. Carpeted office dividers set off a small area, packed with super sophisticated computer equipment.
The last six years I've been risking nothing but money. It's a kick to risk my ass again.
The old Spook. CUT AWAY TO: 263   OMITTED Jackson has the Senator's aide's papers spread before her, cataloging them with interest. The PHONE RINGS. Jackson picks it up. JACKSON  Jackson. Whoever the voice is , it makes Jackson forget the documents. JACKSON  -- Yes... yes, of course, sister, I know who you are.  -- where... where are you?
-- No way to access Covert Ops directly. But Ornstein's at Princeton, he's got a database bigger than Langley -- (works keyboard lovingly) If I can't crack that turkey's code, it's time to hang up my rock and roll shoes -- Nico watches Watanabe work.
-- ah, here! Here's a little trap door. Let's see if we can wriggle up into -- (watches the screen with anticipation) Personnel files! Operative dossiers. Will that do? NICO It's a start. Nico sits down beside Watanabe. DISSOLVE TO: 267   FULL ASHTRAY Watanabe stubs out a cigarette. Empty coffee cups all around. Nico paces, reading a hard-copy printout. NICO Fox has had a helluva career.  '69 to '76, Cambodia, Laos. Operation Phoenix. Operation Green Mountain. Operaton Northstar. This is all Vang Pao, it's all heroin -- WATANABE You friend has found his metier.
Run personnel retrievals on all these operations. I want the names of every company man who was on them.
Altshuler. Cosgrove. I know half these guys --  Okay... now run me an update. Where are these fuckers now? QUICK DISSOLVE TO:

Thirty names from secret drug operations... and two-thirds of 'em are in Central America.  All right. Run these two names: Bautista Salvano and Ramon 'Chi Chi' Testamente.

Watanabe starts punching keys.     * 270   CLOSE - COMPUTER SCREEN Official biographies of Salvano and Chi Chi come up. WATANABE Well, kiss my ass.  Both former Somoza secret police.  Recruited by agency, 1975. Trained Fort Benning, counter insurgency...

 Fox is here, in Chicago... or was here...  ... Listen. Can this thing tap into airlines? Reservations records --
I can get you the ball scores, too. DISSOLVE TO:
As he finishes viewing the screen, stands.
Five agents   from Central American desk. All trained   assassins. All arrived in Chicago in   the last week -- and none of them has   left. Nico grabs his coat, gulps a last swallow of coffee --
Thanks, Wat. You finally may have done some good for your country. WATANABE Where are you going? NICO To find a priest.
How did ya find him?
The nun phoned me. She said two men had been sneaking around the church. She sounded scared --
There's more. I got the papers from that senator's aide's apartment. Everything Harrison's been working on. It's all at my place. CUT TO:
 Once you're inside, you'll signal us. It is the Middle-aged Woman who left the bomb, seen in Father Genarro's church. A police sketch of her was seen on tele- vision.

You wouldn't lie to me, Father?   It's a sin.

You're our backup. If we come out running, then you can shoot. Nico's eyes meet his partner's. It's plain he'll break her leg if he has to, to keep her safe by the car. Jackson accepts this reluctantly.
I know what you are. I know what beasts you are.
300   STAIRWELL FROM ROOF - NICO AND LUKICH
I want to know who you told. FATHER TOMASSINO  I told them... you make the ninos... see... castrating their fathers -- raping... mutilating their mothers ... And...  ... and sometimes... to the ninos... 302   NICO'S POV - HALLWAY
-- Tell me the truth, Father -- The priest's eyes roll grotesquely; he convulses, sweat beading on his forehead. He looks like a man in the agonies of some narcotic hell.
 -- Can we kill him? If you told anyone, about our plans to kill the senator, we cannot do it. FATHER TOMASSINO Nadie.   Nadie. Nadie.                             * 305   NICO AND LUKICH IN HALLWAY O.S. we hear another ELEVATED TRAIN APPROACHING outside. Nico kicks the apartment door in! He and Lukich burst in, guns clutched two-handed. 306   QUICK CUTS
Go!   Go! -- Simultaneously FIRING back through the kicked-in door, EMPTYING his GUN.
 Get him! Finish him!
Now! Nico bolts for the stairwell to the roof, clawing for a new clip as he goes. Salvano and Zagon burst into the hallway, SHOOTING at Nico. 308   INTERCUT - ELEVATED TRAIN THUNDERING along the tracks adjacent to the building.
CUT TO:
 -- Had to be a hero... another fucking hero. I'm sorry Jax. He reaches for a small calendar, looks at it.

LUKICH  We don't know what happened to him, Branca. Ya, she's gonna be alright. 328B   INT. BRANCA'S SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT Branca, a bodyguard next to him, grimly puts down the phone. He looks devastated.
Jesus Christ!
The motherfuckas got Jackson. BRANCA Lukich called. She's not dead. She's gonna make it. She was wearing a vest. Nico can't believe it. In spite of it all, life comes to him. A little smile... NICO That broad didn't trust me. CUT TO:
It was picked up with your mail this afternoon.
Don't worry, they're booked on an early plane. They'll be out of the country tomorrow.
Oh my God, Nico!                                       * Rosa starts forward, her face in agony at the sight of her wounded son. BRANCA He's fine.   The boy has ribs of steel!
 Enough of your humor. Sara clings to Nico's arm, tears in her eyes. Rosa               * crosses herself. Sara begins to weep. The doctor finishes.       * There's a long awkward moment. Then:
 Leave them. Leave them alone.
-- You've got to do it, Nico.    You know you have to. Whatever Sara is proposing, Nico is dead set against it.
Listen to her, Nicola.  Whatever you think of him, Federico is family. He is our family. Nico makes no response.   Instead, he lifts Julian, nuzzles him tenderly.
Ever notice how clean babies smell? Like nothing in the world has touched them yet.
If you won't go to him, I will. NICO  Don't push me like this -- Her eyes meet his -- loving, but desperate.
Branca can put us on a plane -- but where can we fly to? Tibet? The moon? There's nowhere they can't find us.
You don't know what the hell you're talking about. SARA I'm talking about everything I've learned from you in the past five years.
You know I can't go to him. Sara takes both his hands in hers.
Do you know why I love you? Do you know what it is about you that I've always loved? (as Nico fights his own emotion) Pride. It's what you have inside. You don't live the way other people live. You trust what you see as right and won't let anyone or anything make you stray from it.
But now that pride may kill all of us.  You've got to swallow that pride, Nico. Choke on it if you have to. Lay it aside.
Is this the attorney? ANOTHER MAN You can come now, Mr. Carlucci. O.S. we hear a METALLIC sound BEGIN, VERY CLOSE -- PULL BACK TO:
CUT TO:
Waiting in a barren reception room.   Several benches, tables; heavy steel mesh over windows --
I am only an old man. An old man with a cancer. The two are like an old and a young lion, appraising each other -- using all five senses and more.
I don't have much time, Uncle.    So I must speak plainly. Larusso listens.   Nico waits for a beat.   Then:
 -- For as long as I've been old enough to think, I've hated you and hated everything you stood for. Larusso takes this in without a flicker.
I was so sure that you and I were on opposite sides of the fence... and that you and your people were destroying this country -- Nico pauses, glances away across the grounds.
-- The most painful realization of my life was that the people I worked for and you are not far apart.  -- And there's not much difference between what you are and what I was. Larusso studies Nico a long moment.    Then takes Nico's elbow. * 347   OMITTED                                                         * 348   NICO AND LARUSSO
I will be    candid with you. I knew, probably    before you did, that you would be    coming to me. I knew what you would    ask... and I had every intention    of refusing you.
But it is a form of wisdom to know when to cease relying only upon yourself.
You know, of course, that this Senator Harrison will never live to make his speech tomorrow.  You know, too, that as long as this man... this torturer --
Kurt Zagon.
-- As long as this Zagon lives, nothing I can do will guarantee your family's safety.  'Ecce non uomine, ecce bestie.' You know Dante?  'These are not men, these are animals.'
Memorize this address.
Have you got it in your mind? Nico nods.    Larusso tears the paper into tiny shreds.             *
Thank you, Mr. Carlucci. I trust you will give my love to my niece, Rosa. NICO I will do that, Mr. Larusso.  I hope you will be well.
nods: "Bene." Then: without a word he turns and exits back through the steel door. CUT TO:
You got the architect's drawings? Wiring, floor plans -- Nico indicates a briefcase he is carrying. NICO It's all here. Nico turns to his uncle.    Regards him with affection. BRANCA I could help you from here on. NICO It's not your business.
Grazie, tio caro. Branca pats Nico's cheek.
Take care of yourself, Nicola. CUT TO:
Not even you can hit him at this range, Nico. O.S. behind Nico: the unmistakable sound of a .45 SAFETY being CLICKED OFF. Nico freezes, his back to the voice. He raises his hands. NICO That wasn't the plan, Nelson. 366   NELSON FOX covers Nico from behind with a silencer-fitted .45. He glances to the briefcase and building plans, on the floor. FOX Close range, huh? Never work. Place is rigged, scanned every 35 seconds.
 I was thinking of a mine on the roof. Remote-triggered, when the chopper comes in. FOX Roof's wired too.   Sensors every fifteen feet. Fox's finger rests ready on the trigger.
You can turn now.   Slowly.   Slooowly... Nico turns. We see Fox clearly now. His boyish features have weathered since his "spook" days in Vietnam. There is grey in his hair now: he wears an expensive suit and is alone.
I figured you'd do your recon from this building.
You're looking fit, Nelson.
Getting a bit of a tire. NICO  Your own tailor? FOX Hong Kong.
You've gone a long way. Fox motions for Nico to dump his gun; Nico complies, dropping it gently into the briefcase. Nico takes half a step toward Fox. Fox shakes his head in warning.

-- What's so hard to believe. I want to help you, you dumb guinea! NICO Fox the fixer.
If I wanted to cap you, I'd have saved myself this chit-chat. Make big points for me to bring in your scalp. I'd be White House material. NICO Is that what Zagon is?    One of your basement boys?
Zagon's a rancher. 4000 acres in Costa Rica. Beautiful place.
Bought with what -- opium from Cambodia?
And a ton a week of coke from other places. NICO Which he funnels here through Salvano. With the Company getting its cut. FOX Legal tender.
Still dodging appropriations committees, eh, Nelson?
That's my job, Nico. They arrive at an elevator. FOX Keep your nose in the corner. When we get out, stay five paces ahead of me. Cross down to the garage. 367B   INT. LOWER CORRIDOR Nico and Fox emerge from the elevator. Nico lowers his hands from behind his head. Fox keeps his gun out of sight as he and Nico step past. 368    ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT
The Senator couldn't be bought, could he? He was gonna blow the lid off, so you cleared Zagon to frost him --
Keep walking.
But the priest found out somehow and ran here. You couldn't do the Senator's number 'till you knew if the priest had talked. So Zagon flew in with his little medical bag. Only by then I was in on it -- and you thought I might recognize his handiwork.
If your name was Joe Smith I never would have caught it. But how many Nicola Toscani's are there? NICO You got it off the arrest sheet.
I tried to warn you, old buddy. I knew you had wiretaps. and I knew you wouldn't let 'em go. NICO Only I was too dumb to crack it. I was so busy trying to figure a code, I didn't even recognize Zagon's voice. It's all crystal clear to Nico now. NICO So we kill our own senators now. FOX Why not?   The Romans did.
 Are we the Romans?
We're an empire too.
Would you rather spoon borscht and quote Lenin?  I'm trying to save you, asshole! I got a spot for you. Thailand, deep under, no names, no numbers --
Doing what -- processing heroin?
You 'consult.' You 'assist.' You send checks to your family. Zagon won't touch you, you'll be on the team --
Fuck you. FOX In five years you're out, with a fat Swiss account and a GS-15 pension. Nico stares at his old friend with contempt. He sees the gun under Fox's coat, but he's too tired and too disgusted to care --
You know, Fox, right now in Israel they're trying some 80-year-old camp guard for war crimes. And all around our country there are guys on Death Row for killing one person, two people. And probably they all deserve it -- He takes a step toward Fox.   Fox's hand tightens on his gun. NICO  -- but you and I know a couple guys personally who are responsible for the murder of at least what... 60,000 non- military personnel.  Viet. Lao. Thai. Cambodian. Librarians, teachers, doctors... women, children... and that's just a sliver of it. Fox tries to maintain a hard face.   But his own guilty conscience is working --
 We've wiped out entire fucking countries. And not one agent --
 Stop right there!
 -- not one C.I.A. agent has ever been tried or convicted, much less accused of any crimes.  You motherfuckers think you're above the law --  Well, you ain't above mine. Nico holds himself, trembling with intensity. At that moment -- O.S. from the garage entrance ramp: the SQUEAL of APPROACHING TIRES. Nico and Fox turn to see -- *NOTE* 4-17-87.

Salvano, Bad Dude, and two agent types from the       * tenement... and Zagon!                                         * Zagon and his men are forty feet from Nico and Fox, playing it cool so as not to alarm any innocent bystanders, but the bulk under their jackets is unmistakably guns.
Well... well.    What a team we have here. ZAGON  We've been looking for you, Nelson.    I see you've found our friend.
Thanks for the help, Fox.
I didn't bring him, Nico.    I swear it! ZAGON Have you two been sharing fond memories? Reminiscing about the good old days?
Stay still!  Don't fucking move!!
Bring in our friend, Nelson. Salvano's muzzle covers Fox and Nico --
Be a good boy -- 372   FOX
Dive, Nico!! He FIRES -- at Salvano! In the same instant, Salvano pulls his own trigger! Salvano's MACHINE GUN BURST cuts Fox down, a milli-second before Fox's .45 SLUG BLOWS Salvano off his feet! Pandemonium. Fox, dying, slings his .45 to Nico, who snatches it from the ground just as a HAIL of MACHINE GUN FIRE THUNDERS around him. Nico dives headlong behind a concrete column, which is instantly chewed to shreds by GUNFIRE. Zagon FIRES his MAC-10 on full automatic. A second agent hurries forward to outflank Nico. Nico pops from behind the column, DRILLS the agent broadside behind the ear, blowing the whole side of his head off! Guests and valets are shrieking in terror, hitting the deck in clusters, clawing and scrambling over each other for safety. ZAGON (to first agent, advancing) Move! Nico springs from cover, FIRING, trying to bolt down the garage ramp, toward the lower levels. His path puts the first agent directly in Zagon's line of fire. Zagon doesn't hesitate; he OPENS UP on Nico, cutting down his own man -- Salvano has gotten to his feet, wounded, but still handling his gun. He  joins Zagon, rushing forward --
hold the trigger down, FULL AUTOMATIC --
Reloading as Salvano FIRES. 379    NICO'S CAR pinwheels out of control, its nose facing away from Salvano and Zagon. The car BRAKES FURIOUSLY -- 380    NICO hits reverse, looking back over the seat -- 381    NICO'S POV - THROUGH REAR CAR WINDOW He sees Salvano, his clip empty now, hurrying to wrestle a fresh magazine in -- 382    ANGLE - NICO'S CAR AND SALVANO
A horrible death.
Reloaded, turning his gun toward Nico, when --
scampers free. Nico gets to his feet, bleeding. Nico is between Zagon and Zagon's machine gun on the ground. Zagon bolts for his car. Nico dives for the gun --                      *
leaps   into the other, half-destroyed car. Its two front tires   are flat, windshield blown out, RADIATOR POURING STEAM. Nico   does the only thing he can do: puts the pedal to the metal   in reverse, BLASTS across the ramp divider, takes off after   Zagon in reverse --
leaps free, sprints toward the hotel alley.     Nico takes off after him on foot --
hurtles after him, gaining.     Nico whips around the alley corner, straight into: 401   FOUR ARMED AGENTS waiting beside a plain grey TV remote van. Nico skitters         * to a stop as a shotgun, an M-16 and two pistols cover him. Shotgun Agent raises his weapon to fire -- ZAGON No!   I want him! I want him alive!
-- this is bullshit, Zagon. We got work to do.
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
in a metal chair, wrists taped in front of him. One agent stands behind him, clasping a thin cable noose wrapped tight around Nico's throat. Shotgun agent holds his weapon on him, its twin muzzles inches from Nico's skull. 406   ZAGON
We've got an hour before the honorable senator. (hands towel to pistol agent) You've got to learn to take time, smell the roses.
How are you gonna do him, Zagon? In a motorcade? Or passing through a hotel kitchen? The Noose agent jerks his cable tight, making Nico gag and choke. Zagon motions to slacken off. He stops at a small table before Nico -- unrolls a well-worn felt pouch. Zagon watches Nico's reaction as the tools of the inter- rogator's trade come into view -- drug vials, syringes, scalpels, surgical tools.
I've used these little beauties many times to extract information -- (lifts a needle to the light) -- This'll be the first time I've ever used them... just for fun.
ZAGON  Take his arms. Pistol agent and Bad Dude move in, one on each side,         * seizing Nico's forearms. Shotgun agent holds his weapon tight to Nico's head.
Hold him up! Pistol agent and Bad Dude lift Nico. Zagon slams him again. Again. Nico's cheekbone is broken; blood drains from his nose. Zagon aims a two-handed blow; backhands Nico, crushing the other side of his face! Zagon backs off, chest heaving. Pistol agent and Bad Dude plop Nico back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose. Nico looks like the Viet prisoner -- the one we saw in the opening sequence. Like the prisoner, Nico takes his beating -- still conscious, still meeting Zagon's eyes with defiance.
This is where you came in, Toscani. Only, now it's where you're gonna check out. He takes off his glove, grabs the syringe. Pistol agent and Bad Dude clamp Nico's right arm down tight. Zagon injects Nico.
reacts instantly to the hypo -- cursing, sputtering under the choking noose. He twists wildly trying to free him- self, but the agents' powerful arms hold him. ZAGON That's it. Fight it, cherry. Fight it, so it speeds faster on its way -- Nico struggles more violently.
Fight it. Till the vessels burst in your brain. Till the arteries rupture in your heart --
That's my boy. That's what I was waiting for -- Zagon produces his famous knife. He motions Pistol agent and Bad Dude to release Nico's arms. Noose agent slackens his grip on the choke cable. Zagon moves in closer, gloating, cooing --
A fool learns from his own mistakes. But a wise man learns from the mistakes of others -- (moves closer, blade in hand) You should have killed me when you had the chance, Toscani --
Can you feel the chemicals, cherry? You can't fight 'em much longer -- NICO Long enough to finish you. Sweating, half-spitting, Zagon slashes at Nico like an animal -- Nico traps the knife, and enters, smashes Zagon in the face with one lightning blow. We see Zagon's nose and face completely cave in. Nico comes under Zagon's elbow, the arm that still holds the knife clamping it in a vise-like grip and bending it backwards, slowly, against the joint -- which now starts to rip in half. Zagon is screaming and cursing, writhing in agony -- The drugs have hit Nico full force now. He's weakening, his eyes are starting to roll. Zagon tries one last surge of strength to save himself; it almost seems he'll wriggle free when: the elbow JOINT SNAPS in half with a sicken- ing sound.

FADE IN ON:
shove mikes and cameras at the senator and the judge, shouting questions. Lukich, Neeley and Strozah clear a path for them. *
 -- Senator Harrison has today issued a statement calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor -- CUT TO:
Earlier this week, the Harrison Commission delivered its report on the growing C.I.A. scandal to Congress...
 -- officially-sanctioned deceit, murder and corruption, will continue until these men are brought to justice.
Detective Toscani. I wanted to personally thank you. You are making it possible for a sliver of truth to finally come out.
And this is Clayton Alspaugh of the fifth circuit court. NICO Your Honor. The Judge nods to his stenographer, who swiftly sets up her equipment, takes a seat. Rosa makes a face at Branca, who rises, clearing a seat for the Judge. Sara moves              * in tight beside Nico. JUDGE ALSPAUGH Are you sure you're feeling well enough? Nico glances to Sara, to the supporting faces around              * him. Lukich. Neeley. Strozah. Jackson. The others.                * NICO  If you're ready to listen, I'm ready to talk. 423   CLOSE - STENOGRAPHER'S HANDS As the Judge's VOICE begins OVER, "slating" the depo- sitions, the stenographer's fingers start moving.
