Know what the problem is, kid?   You're too ugly to get propositioned.
Look who's talking, old man.
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
Next week we work the park.
I gotta get back on top.   Get off the sleaze detail.
You will, one day at a time.   I'll be old and grey when it happens...
A small gift, sir, for the Queen ...
I keep a record, see? They don't pay, I don't forget.
Here you go, your Highness.
Thank you, officer.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
You don't fish.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
No thanks.   I got close but it never woulda worked.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
What was it this time?
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
C'mon, let's check it out.
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
Ow!   Son-of-a-bitch.
You okay?
Yeah, just a nick ...
Freeze!   Police!
 Drop it!
Let her go.
No, the girl!
 We gotta get outta here!
 Tell them to drop it - now!
You have no idea how sorry you're going to be.  Don't worry.
Mike...
Don't talk.
Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
It's all I got... it's yours.
It don't work-
 Ain't that a shit--
Hey, Reilly, Captain's looking for you.
Prints?
Nothing so far.
What about the ballistics report?
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Captain...
Reilly, what the hell happened out there?   Why didn't you call for back-up?
 Sir, I--
 Dammit, Rice was a good man,
I want to work this.
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
But sir--
You know the rules. You're off the street `til I.A.D. clears the investigation. Now go home and clean yourself up, get some rest...
She won't talk. Look at this shit, no I.D., nothing...
What's that?
Bracelet she was wearing.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
Maybe she knows your old man.
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
I'll do it.
Okay, kid.    Run this down to the Cave.
May I help you?
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
They're not here.
Where are they?
And you are...?
Officer Reilly, vice.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
-Where?
2600 block of Lakefront.   A limousine.   But, I-
Thanks.
 Bomb Squad.
Smell anything, Schnoz?    Me, neither.
Schnoz, come here, boy.
Shhh, I hear something....
Who the heck're you?
You the Bomb Squad?
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
 Reilly, Vice. I-
Quiet!
Ticker.
Schnoz says it's loaded.    Good boy, Schnozzie.
Alright boys, look close.   Let's assess.
Whadaya think, "boy" or "girl"?
It's a "girl" !
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
No shit.   I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Who's in charge here?
He is!
Look, it's important.
Make an appointment.
It's about this.
Where did you get this?
Off a girl's wrist.    A suspect...
P.E.T.N ...
What?
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
What do you mean?
Fire in the hole!
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
Thanks.
Hey wait a minute-
Vice... Jesus.
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
They're holding her downtown.
What about the cop?
If you'd let me waste him.
What if she talks?
She won't.
I say we split town. Come back to this job when things cool. We've got other contracts - Denver, Seattle...
I want her back and we do the job.
I thought we agreed, the personal can't interfere with the professional.
Besides, we're on a schedule and the cops won't let her go.
Unless we make them.
Hey...
Captain-
Captain, line one!
 I thought I told you--
He says it's important, something about the Rice shooting.
Winters.
What...?
I said release the girl or alot of people are going to die.
It's exactly two o'clock. If she's not released in one hour, people die.
Wait, what do you mean--?
Shit!
What the hell was that?
A ticking bomb...
What?
 It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
I'll do it.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
Yes, sir.
No, honey, I'm fine. Yeah, well, you're welcome. You deserve flowers more often.
Bev, you're the greatest...
Hey, I'm next.
Hey, that's the guy-
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
A cop was killed last night interrupting a robbery. One of the gang was grabbed, a girl. The one I told you about with the detonation cord. Well, her friends just called in, they're threatening to waste people unless she's released in the next hour.
Alright, let's check it out.
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
Vice cop on a homicide?
Captain assigned me to assist you.
Assist?   What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
Easy, guys.  
Look, nothing personal, but you can't just waltz in here and expect to join the team.
What're you talking about?
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
We've got one hour.     Are you coming or not?
Okay, fuck you.
Those vice cops, around all that pussy, so pent up.
 What do you think?
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Right.
 T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
What time is it?
Twenty after.
Swan, it's no use. Look, we can still make Houston--
Shut up!
Hey, beautiful, can I buy you some bangers and mash? Pint of Guiness?
Last chance. You know, even the smallest choices in life could change everything.
Fuck off, pal.
Eight dead, so far.
What're you doing here?
You're offsides. Beat it.
I said get the fuck outta here.
You touch me again and--
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
What the hell's going on?
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose...   This fuck-up is interfering with-
Reilly, what're you doing here?
Sir...
I thought I told you--
He's with us.
We asked him to come.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
Go ahead, kid.
I'm filing charges against that mother-
Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
What was-?   Why...?
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
What?
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
Now wait just a fucking-
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
By the way, I'm Glass.   This is T.J., and Pooch.
Mike Reilly.
 Uh-huh...
That there's Schnoz, mascot and ace bomb sniffer. Say hi, Schnozzie.
Flame racer, partial P.C.L. See this wave pattern? Definitely self-contained.
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
What kind of bomb was it?
Device.
Huh?
We don't use the b-word.      Bad luck.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Treat.    We treat devices.
 Anything else I should know?
Don't push it, slick.
Pooch, can you move it?
I don't know...
Yes, baby, yes ...
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
C4, plastic explosive.
Helluva fuck factor.
Don't worry, you'll pick it up.
Hey, check this out?
Lemme see that.
Hardware.
Computer device?
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
What can you tell us about the girl with the exploding jewelry?
I'll get back to you.
Let's go, we gotta jump on him the second he calls again.
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Captain, it's him!
Winters here.
Don't make me send another.
Look, we're prepared to talk, what do you want--?
Hello?   Hello?
Section commanders, in my office, now.
Where's the girl? The one I brought in.
Upstairs, interrogation.
Three hours. She's tough.
Tough? Tough is "Fuck you, where's my lawyer?". This chick doesn't say boo.
Any luck?
Bupkiss.    Sorry about Rice.
Captain said I could give it a crack.
She ain't no hooker.   This is a murder investigation.
She was my collar. Maybe I'll get lucky. But, if you got a problem with that, talk to the Captain.
I'll be in the can.
You remember me.
You know, your boyfriend just killed a ten year old at a bus stop, blew her head clean off.
You're scared. You're just caught in the middle. But, we've got a guy out there wasting people just to get you back. Why? It can't be because of your looks. So, I'll be honest with you -
Let me be very clear about this. The police won't let you go. When your boyfriend realizes this, I have a feeling a lot of innocent people are going to die. Kids, families. I know you don't want that to happen.
We missed you, where'd you go?
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
Awright!   How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
Glass, what is it?
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
Whadaya mean?
It's from an IRA.
Oh shit...
A what?
IRA - instant retirement account.
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
Only once, at Redstone.
Where...?
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Shit.   We're fucked.
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
Stop it...
 And what's he doing to help?
Shut up, T.J.!
Be nice Pooch!
All of you, shut the fuck up!
No wonder the rest of the department doesn't want to work with you. You're nothing but a bunch of... punks.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
Hey, look--
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Oh yeah?     Prove it.
 Drive.
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
Then let's go see what they missed.
So what were they doing here?
I don't know. You tell me?
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
You mentioned something called Redstone.
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
Cream of the crop, huh?   You?
 Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?
So this is where it happened.
Girl was here. The guy in charge was over there with one of his men, the other one was back there.
Bombers, what kettle of fish are they?
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
Hello.
French. Doubt somebody who worked here smoked it. Only half gone, put it out in a hurry.  
Figuring the length, assuming it was one of these guys, odds are... it was lit outside.
This is where the van was parked.
Yep.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Look, it's a longshot...
Bingo!
No question, it was definitely the one used to l-light the butt. Finger pressure suggests a male, average build, height... no prints, trace of nylon fiber... he wore a glove.
This is strange.
 Three foreign particles ... vulcanized rubber ... resin ... nitro-cellulose.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
Ka-Boooom.
They make bowling balls out of vulcanized rubber ...
Resin...
Lane oil...
 A bowling alley.
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
 You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
 "Punks", huh?
Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
Right!
Pooch, why don't you e-mail your buddies at Langley and on the other side of the pond, see if any IRAs been popping up lately?
You got it.
 We work fast enough for you?
T.J., what're you doing?
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
So what're we looking for?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
How long are we going to stay?
`Til we get a better lead.
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
Insurance?
Political.
Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies.   Some insured, some not. 
But there's traces of C4 and assorted inflammatory additives found in each case. The only common denominator is the detonators all had circuitry consistent with our micro- chip.
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Right.
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
I got a friend over at Scotland Yard who's gonna try and reach out to a undercover guy who would know if any of the rightwingers are circulating over here. Bev's following up on the briefcase manufacturers, too.
Pooch, you're up.    Rack `em.
Boss, you're buying the next round.
How're you guys doing?
Still waiting for a miracle.   Go ahead.
Quite a team you've got, where'd you find them?
It's a small fraternity, everyone knows everyone. I'm always recruiting. Pooch is ex- D.O.D., military expert... claymores, grenades. He played linebacker at Boston College, worked a K-9 unit - that led him to the Bomb Squad... great nose, lousy fingers, we try to keep him away from the tickers. T.J. is a heck of chemist, Texas A&M engineering degree. Found him in a Militia chat room - turns out we were both monitoring the same groups. Bev is the natural born hacker, we stole her from dispatch. She had the Cave reorganized and ultra-high-tech in two months. Captain has no idea how much hardware she's "found" for us.
You guys seem pretty tight.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Why do you do it?
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it.   See, when you beat one of these things... 
there's that one second when you realize you saw something you weren't supposed to see... this beautiful naked woman... Death... and then the rush comes, the high, cuz you realize you got away with it.
Lesbians.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
There he goes. He was here the whole time.
Say, thanks for the back up--
He set one, the son-of-a...
 Clear the area, please.
 You heard him, get the fuck away, it's a bomb!
Alright.   Let's assess.
IRA.
Oh shit...
Fuck factor ten.
Okay, I'm going in, nobody breathe.
Altimeter... choking coil... mercury switch...
Triple V.O.M... brilliant... this guy's a master...
It's one of these wires.
So cut both.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
Which one's which?
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
You can go back to the van if you like.
No, I'm with you.
You okay?
 Is this a great job or what?
 Nothing. Nothing traceable.
I don't know, honey. I'll see. No, everything's fine, it was nothing.
You guys hungry? The wife's got a heap of lasagna leftover.
 What do ay say?
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly.      C'mon.
Good meal would go a long way to steady your system.
Got work to do, don't we?
In case you change your mind.
What's this?
Report on the case so far.
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
Yes, sir.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
I imagine as soon as they find out one of their's is dead, we'll be getting another call. So get some sleep, alright.
To recap, a gunman carrying what police described as a phony bomb was shot and killed less than an hour ago.
While the man's motives and identity remain a mystery, police are denying the incident is related to the explosion that ripped through a bar earlier today, killing 15 and wounding more than 30...
She talked.
More coffee, T.J.?
No thanks, Meg. Hawed Pooch ever get so lucky?
Mr. Reilly?
Mike.   No thanks, I'm fine.
Time for bed, kiddos.   Say goodnight.
Can Uncle Teej tuck us in?
C'mon, champ, I'll even give you a piggyback.
 Goodnight Uncle Charlie, goodnight Uncle Mike.
`Night...
How long were you hooked?
What?
You don't have to talk about it.
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Your partner?
 I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
This was his. Doesn't work for shit, but it's keeping me straight.
Let me see.
Main spring's stuck. All you have to do is free the palate and realign the balance wheel. Here, you try.
I terrible with mechanical things.
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
Okay, first push the pin back with this. Good. Now while you keep it there, stick this in here and turn it slowly. Easy, that's it. Now let the pin go and line up the wheel. That should do it.
It's working.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Okay, hit it.
Alright!
We've created a monster.
Any word?
Nothing.    Maybe they gave up, split town.
Don't bet on it.
How's the print coming?
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Damn.
Coffee, Mike?
No thanks, Bev.
Yes, sir.   He's here.   I'll tell him.
Mike, Captain wants to see you right away.
Yes ... no, of course not but ... yes, sir, I understand.
I got a call from upstairs. They say you questioned the girl.
Yes, sir.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
I didn't.     But I had to try.
Reilly, I think I've shown that I'm a patient man. Rice was your biggest fan and I've tried to honor him by giving you some slack. But you are very close to running out of slack.
Yes, sir.
I read your report. Impressive. I'd say it's got detective written all over it. But... you cross the line one more time... you're gone. Are we clear?
Now, that out of the way. The girl wants to talk to you, alone.
So get going, let's close this thing.
Yes, sir.
I'll be outside.
Hello.
Hello.
My name is Mary Jordan. We were hired to take out some industrial sites. Insurance.
But they weren't all insured.
Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
Who is he?
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
Taylor's dead.
Where are they, Mary?
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
Thank you.
He's my brother...
Then why tell me?
People are dying.
Ex-girlfriend?
Be right back.
Excuse me... I'm looking for two men who were staying at the hotel over there - one has a beard, the other's tall, thin. You wouldn't happen to have seen them, would you?
No.
No, of course not... well, thanks anyway. Here you go, Your Highness.
On second thought, maybe I did.
Lemme see... yeah, here it is, 11:18 this morning. Very disrespectful. He used to drive a van, but he got a new car. You want the license number?
You're beautiful!
We're back in business!
Ran the license plate - car was rented early this morning from a Hertz office downtown.
Alex Swan - demolitions expert, trained at Redstone, dropped out, freelanced in the middle East for awhile, then disappeared, no criminal record. The other one, Leveau, is French Canadian, he's a mercenary, record in half a dozen countries.
Get out an APB, now!
Jesus. Pluchinsky, get four squad cars out to my house, get my family out of there, tell my wife I'm on my way.
Yes, sir.
... suspects driving a dark green Ford Grenada, license number one Two Eight Michael Vincent Edward ...
We've got company.
Glass, there they are. Pooch right in front of you, you got `em, you got `em.
Dispatch, this is Bomb Squad. Suspects sighted on Fern Street, two blocks from HQ. In pursuit.
Roger that.   All available units...
Police, freeze!
Oh... damn.
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
 Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
It's our only option.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
I know.
You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.
Glass--!
It's him!
Winters here.
You motherfuckers, you don't learn, do you?!
We're prepared to talk-
Shut up!    Shut up!
15...
You have exactly thirty minutes to release the girl where you found her.
Twelve ...
Thirty minutes.
Nine ...
How do we know you'll keep your word?
 Okay, let's move!
Get out and go to the machine shop -
She's out of the bag.
 Position Four. Turning on Elm.
 Six.   She's crossing to Main.
She just went into a department store.    She's out of sight.
Seal the building!  Let's move.
 We have contact. Black Camaro-
-license number HQW-256.
You okay?
Alex-
I know.   I warned them.
What is that?
Security.
C'mon, cowboy, you're next.
Okay, what's it gonna be? I got China White, Snow Flake, Ivory Pearl...
 Hey, asshole ...
Hey, I'm talking to you--
You hungry?     We could get something to eat.
What's the matter?
Nothing... just tired.
Why are we stopping here?
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
No...   No more killing.
Stay here.
Alex, please.
Stay in the truck.
Operator.
Get me the police!
Is this an emergency?
Yes! Please, hurry!
Police, Sergeant Doyle speaking.
Please, I need help, my name is--
Whoa, slow down, lady. Now what's that again?
Who are you calling, sis?
What?    Nobody, I-
Alex, please-
Shut up!  Who is this?
Sergeant Doyle, Metro P.D. Look, what's going on--?
Help!
Hey--?
C'mon, move it.
All units, 211 reported at 8th and Sycamore. Suspect is a Caucasian male, armed with an automatic weapon, last seen heading east with female hostage in a U-Haul truck ...
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Go ahead.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.
Hang on.
T.J. here.
T.J., it's Reilly, put Glass on!
What's up?
Where you guys at?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
How do you know?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Should we head for the Interstate?
Would you?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Me, too.
 Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
 You got it.
 All units, suspect spotted heading down alley behind Grand Hotel. 
 We need back-up, now.
 Reilly, what the hell are you-?
 Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Pull back.   You're only an observer.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
 We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
Jesus...
Reilly!    He's loaded!
 Glass, you guys take cover, goddammit!
I want out, right now.      Or the whole city block is gone.
Reilly, he's got enough to do it.
Reilly, don't. He's got a pressure switch. He releases it, we're done for.
Drop it.
 Take him!
Hold on to that thing tight.
Jesus Fucking H. Christ...
Fuck factor?
Off the scale.
What do we do?
Can you hold it?
Talk to me.     Let's assess.
Right.
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Good, now the other side.
Nothing.
Okay, let's go in.
Not enough time ... gotta go for the blasting cap. Only one chance... hand entry.
Keep talking.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips.   Tell me everything you feel.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
Don't touch that.
More metal... sharp edge...
Stay to your left.
Get outta here, Swan's down, but they're chilling a device.
Something round, two wires ...
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
What's wrong?
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
Make up your mind, trigger.
Ease your thumb over to the right - feel anything?
Yeah, another round thing.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
Which one's which?
I don't know.
What... ?
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
How the hell do you feel yellow?
No excuses, just do it!
Not bad, for a rookie.
Thanks.
All clear, but we need an ambulance!
Nice work.
Mayor loves a hero.
Just want you wanted. Your promotion, and transfer.
Thank you, Captain.
Hey, you look great.
You're late.
 Welcome to the family.
Nice to be here.
That feeling won't last long.
