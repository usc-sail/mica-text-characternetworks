In a time of great strife, a legendary interdimensional being known as Zordon, came to the city of Angel Grove to establish a vanguard in the never ending struggle against evil.  with the aid of his trusted assistant, Alpha 5, the noble master sought out six extraordinary teenagers and gave them the power to transform into an unstoppable fighting force.  In time of great need, the young heroes could now call upon colossal assault vehicles known as "Zords".  while the identity of the six remained a guarded secret, their courageous exploits soon became the stuff of Legend, earning them the title...  The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.
YeeeoowwWWWWW!!!
We're OUTTA here!!
Easy, Rock.
Once we hit the target zone we've got fifteen seconds to make the drop.
Step aside, pinheads.
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
Lead on, flyboys.
Bulk... where'd the earth go?
Five seconds to the target zone!
Aisha  you' re  on !
Stylin!
On your tail!
All systems
Surf's up!
Catch you on the flipside.
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
Let's BREAK!!
Okay, so the firemen landed four out of six inside the target --
How `bout a show tune?!
Somebody wanna keep chose bowlers in line.
Hey dad, get with the program!
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Angel Grove High
And that's one!  A perfect landing!
Three for three.  Look at `em go!
That's five perfect landings! Now it's all up to Tommy Oliver.
Touch down.
Looking good up there.
Thanks, man.
Congratulations - the Observatory's got a new lease on life.
Awesome!   Ryan's Comet is passing over in two days!
Who's up for lunch?
You read my mind.
Last one to Ernies buys.
Let's roll!
Stealth Eagle, huh?  The Lame Duck is more like it!
Let's take the shortcut!
We're here at the World Center Construction Site, where a mysterious object was just uncovered in a freak accident in which one workman suffered minor injuries...
13                                                                  13
... Angel Grove Police have cordoned off the area until it can be determined whether or not the unidentified object poses any threat.  The injured workman was quoted as saying...
It's one smooth move and then you've gotta explode off the top.
Nice and easy.
Hey, no Karate on the patio!
Actually, Ernie, it's Tae-Kwan Doe.
Well Tae-Kwan-Do-it some place else.
So, what're the plans for the weekend?
Aisha and.I are checking out a new dance spot.
I heard that!
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
That's right - Ryan's Comet.
We should throw a little comet shindig.
Any excuse for a party.
The Eagle has landed.
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
We could smell it's breath.
There's a spot over there.
What's up, Alpha?
Rangers, we need you at the Command  Center,  L.R.N. !
'Like Right Now.'
We're on our way.
What's happening?
Ay,  yi,  yi,  yi,  yi !  Our thermionic-sensors have been hit by a CATACLYSMIC surge of evil!
Rangers, you must act swiftly. The planet is in GRAVE danger!
Danger from what?
Six thousand years ago a morphological being known as Ivan Ooze, ruled the world with a reign of unparalleled terror. Finally, a rebel factor known as the "Order of the Meledon" lured him into a hyperlock chamber and buried him deep underground.
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
Another Saturday night and I'm traipsing around the galaxy with the THREE LITTLE PIGS!  My mother warned me this would happen! Rita, she said, after 89 marriages you might wanna think about throwing in the towel.  Why didn't I listen to her?!
That's a good question.
No need to wake him.  In fact, why don't you take a little nap yourself.
Hey bonehead, get off my hoof!
After two thousand years of searching...  I have finally found you.
Yo, earth to Bigfoot!
Watch your mouth, fuzz-ball!
SILENCE!
Where did you FIND this rabid little rodent, anyway?!
Mordant's my second cousin three times removed on my mother's side.  He`s just visiting for the summer.
Well put a muzzle on him!
What... you spent two thousand years looking for this tub of SNOT!
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
Boss.
For your information this is not just your average, run-of-the- mill tub of snot !
You're trying to tell me there`re different levels of snot?!
Boss.
WHAT!
Ahhhhhhhh.
Ladies and Gentlemen... the OOZE is back!!
He's so cute.
I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of all that is good and decent.  It is a supreme honor to finally meet you.
How can I ever repay you?
Do you recall the name...  Zordon of Eltare?
Seems to ring a bell.
I want you to destroy Zordon, so that my evil may once again reign SUPREME.
I will not only destroy him, I will OBLITERATE his entire being. It will be like Zordon of Eltare never EXISTED!
Finally, a real man.
Here's his address.
"... left off Interstate 12?!"
It's like a freeway.  How long have  you  been  locked  up? !
We shall leave you to weave your wicked ways.
Now we go out on the town.  First dinner, then dancing, then --
What is that odious stench?
Smell's like...   TEENAGERS!
Remind me to have a word with Alpha about his teleporting calculations.
Anybody see anything?
... Let's take a look over there.
It looks like it's been opened!
You had me scared there.
Makes two of us.
You haven't by any chance seen a ... morphological being lurking around?
The only thing I've seen is you teenagers.  And you know... if there's one thing in the world I reeeeally hate....
It's TEENAGERS
GroSS!
You're too kind.  Allow me to introduce myself.  I am the infamous, world-reviled, universally despised, IVAN OOZE!
Well, pack your bags cause we're sending you back where you came from!
Gee, a teenager with a big mouth. Not much has changed in six thousand years.
we're not just teenagers, raisin- head.
We're the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers!
Ooooh, where's my autoqraph book?.
Power Rangers, huh?  So Zordon is still using a bunch of rug-rats to do his dirty work.  And speaking of rats...
From this moment forth, the world as you know it SHALL CEASE TO EXIST!
WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE!
He's  gone.
Let's take these beasts!!
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
Well...  ALMOST nobody.
Gee... pretty fancy-shmancy.  I guess if you invest your money well over SIXTY centuries you can buy something pretty nice.
HI ,  YAH !
Welcome to Wiener World.  May I take your order, please?
You haven't changed, Ooze. You're still picking on creatures smaller than yourself.
Put a cork in it "Z" .  Ten minutes out of the egg and I'm already listening to one of your lectures.
 And then you came along.  You locked me into your stuffy little hyperlock-chamber and tossed me into the depths like yesterdays TRASH!
It worked for six thousand years.
Don't remind me!
Do you have any idea what it's like to be cooped up in a rotten egg for six thousand years?  It's BORING!  Not to mention I've had a Charlie horse since the Renaissance!  But now the tables are turned.  Now...
... it's time to pay the PIPER!
Oh, the things that I have missed.  The BLACK PLAGUE!
And now, finally, I have the strength to DESTROY your pathetic powers FOREVER!!
YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS!
I've got a NEWS flash for you LIGHT-BRIGHT -- I ALREADY HAVE!
You put your left probe in, you put your left probe out, you put your left probe in and you shake it all about.  You do the hokey- pokey and you turn yourself around...
RAT breath!!
Somebody needs a shave.
IT'S MORPHIN TIME!
PTERODACTYL!
TRICERATOPS!
TYRANNOSAURUS!
MASTODON!
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
WHITE TIGER!
MORPHENOMENAL!
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
Activating Power Beam!
Everybody stay alert.
Hold it...
I heard something over there.
Activating Audio Enhancer!
They're on the other side of that wall.
Anybody see them?
Activating Power Scope!
THEY'RE ABOVE US!!
Hey, handsome!
My mistake.
SABA SABER?
What a DREAM I was having!
We've got company.
Rats!  I hate rats!
Bad move, Willard!
STEGA-STINGER!
Coming through!
Target Neutralized?
Raptor-Ribbon!
Now you see `em.
Now you don't.
Not the brightest of beasts.
Na na na na na!
Fried mice, anyone?
What's going on?!
Alpha, come in!
We'd better get back.
Something's wrong!
Come on, guys...
... what happened here?...
Guys!
Alpha, are you okay?!
I'll GET you my pretty, and your little DOG toa!!
He must've blown an anitromic demodulator!
Oh, no...
... What's happening to him?'
Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
We have to help him!
...  Rangers... thank goodness you're safe.
We have to get you back inside your time warp.
I'm afraid that's impossible... The power has been destroyed. It's gone... The Zords, the weapons...  all of it.  The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are no more.
Zordon... you can't leave us. Ever since you came into our lives... you've been like another father `to  us  all.-
... You must be strong... Ivan almost overthrew the planet once...  and now I'm afraid he has the strength to see his scheme through.
what're we going to do?
I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham! I do not like them, Sam-I-am!
Ah-Ah-Ahhhh-CHOO!!
Thanks, Billy.
There has to be something we can do.
Come on, guys, think!
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
What?!
... They say that somewhere beyond the Hyperion Constellation there exists a mythological power that is beyond all comprehension.
How can we get to it?
As the legend goes, the power is impossible to obtain.
We have to try, Alpha.  It's our only hope.
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
If Ivan  Ooze  isn't  stopped, nobody will survive.
Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
How can we reach Phaedos?
Zordon's going to have my orbicular spheroids when he hears out about this!
This is an emergency reserve of morphonic emissions.  It should be enough to get -you there.
There is one problem.  I only have enough reserve to send you Phaedos...  I can't bring you back.
So how do we get back?
... You'll have to pray that the legends are true.
You're sure you want to do this?! The Rangers share purposeful looks.
It's our only hope.
Safe journey, Rangers!
BE CAREFUL!!
Ay, yi, yi, yi.  They're DOOMED!!
How could he let them slip through his hands?!  He's no better than the rest of the hired help around here!
According to the TX Tracker, they're headed for Phaedos.
I'm gonna fire that slimeball so fast his not gonna know what hit him!
Hi, honey, I'm home !
You garlic-sucking DINGLEBRAIN! The Rangers are going after the Great Power  I thought you said this guy was the Master of Disaster?  He's nothing but a slime- infested, jelly-bellied blob of --
Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me!
Sorry, slick, there's been a slight'change of plans.  The "booger man" is taking over.
Nobody double-crosses Lord Zedd and lives!
Zedd's gonna kick this snotball into next week!
Ooooh, that tickles!
My turn.
This is all your fault!  If you'd taken me out tonight like you were suposed to, none of this would've happened.
Now you have a choice, either serve me, or join those insufferable cheesedongs.
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
He's just visiting for the summer.  Now what about,the Rangers, oh hideous one?
Ah yes, the RANGERS!!!
Gasunteidt.
SHUT YOUR BEAKS !!
Tengu Warriors, you will fly to Phaedos, find the Power Rangers...  and TEAR THEM APART!
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
IIIIIII!!!
Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions!
It just goes to show, ya never go into business with a booger.
Watch the HAIRRRRRRRR!!
Everybody okay?
Where' s  BILLY? !
Ay, yi, yi, yi!  The filamentary transistors have malfunctioned!
Why you low-frequency, battery operated --
WHOAAAAAAHHHH!!!
BILLY!!
You okay?
I think so.
This puddle thing is really getting on my nerves.
Welcome to beautiful downtown Phaedos.
... Incredible...
Let's see if we can find this Master warrior.
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
You want me to place a few calls?
No need.   I'm going to use the young minds of Angel Grove.
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
But boss, what about their parents?
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
I understand you're looking for a few new assistants.
Well put your mind to rest `cause now you've got the best.
What is this?!  I advertised for brilliant and good looking assistants!
Hi, I'm brilliant.
And I'm good looking.
And I'm Little-Bo-Peep.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
A stellar idea, Skull.
Not so fast, greaseballs.
You'll have to do.
Hey.
You okay?
I was just thinking about Zordon...  everything we've been through together.
You know, meeting Zordon... teaming up with you guys, it's the best thing that's ever happened to me.
It's the best thing that's ever happened to all of us.
... He's gonna make it, guys.
We'll get this warrior...  save Zordon...  and send that SLIMEBALL Ivan Ooze back to the SEWER he crawled out of.
TAKE COVER!
THEY'RE T00 STRONG??
WE NEED OUR POWERS!!
WHAM!  KAPOW!  BOOM!
#0!@!#!
HANG ON, KIMBERLY.
What's the matter with you woodpeckers!  Take this guy out!
The Tengu Warriors my butt!  The Tengu TURKEYS is more like it!
Hey, aren't you bird-brains forgetting something?!
Watch the meathooks!!
Wow!  That was amazing for such a little dude!
You're trespassing.  Now state your business.
We're looking for the Master Warrior.  Do you know where we can find him?
The Master Warrior doesn't entertain visitors  -
But we have to find him.  Our leader Zordon is dying.
Zordon?
How did this happen?!
The lady asked you a question.
Huh ... Oh, uh, we re, ah...
He was attacked by this horrific being -- Ivan Ooze.
Ivan Ooze is free?!  We are all in mortal danger!
Let' s go.
Kind of bossy, isn't she?
Boys and girls, girls and boys, gather round and feast your eyes. This ain't sludge and this ain't guck... this is the one and only Ivan's Ooze!  Yesireebob.  It's ooey, gooey and even kind of chewy.  But best of all it's FREE!
Here you go!  No pushing!
There's enough for everybody!
So where'd this guy come from?
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
INCOMING!
Come on, come all -- it's an COZE FREE FOR ALL!
Is this... food!
They're called squirbs.
Mine seems to be a little undercooked.
Add a few dried weevils and you'll never know the difference.
... Not bad.
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
What do you know of the Great Power?
Only that we need it to defeat Ivan Ooze.
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
Where did it originate?
In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
So how can we get to it?
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
And how do we do that?
By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja.  It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
Look, Zordon doesn't have much longer to live.  And for all we know, Angel Grove could already be under attack.  We don't have TIME for this.
You don't understand.  If you do not have the Ninjetti, the power will destroy  you.  To reach the Monolith we must traverse the Neola jungle.  We will train today, and set out on foot tomorrow.
HNUGLHLU PHUNGLUMP BUGHLSMRPH GBUJIPHN HUPHLGMPNORU!!!
Snoggle, you watch your language!
Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?
Excuse me?
Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Ah... sure.
Ah... thanks.
... Not bad.
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
Yeah, right.
It will not harm you.
Just kidding.
Wow.  Sand.
Now tell me... what do you see?
I see... a bear
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
Stylin'!
I see... an Ape.
Rocky, you are the Mighty Ape.
I see... a fox
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
I think its some kind of bird.
Kimberly, you are the Crane, agile and sublime.
That's gotta be a frog.
Adam, you are the Frog, quick as lightning.
It's... an eagle?
Look closer.
... A falcon?
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
I... am the sole living descendant of the "Nathadians".  Now prepare yourselves for the most intense physical and mental training known to man and animal.
Dad... ??!
DAD?!
You seen my parents?
I can't find my dad either.
What's going on?!
Ooze, ooze, ooze rules!!
That guy was the student body President
The crane maintains it's agility through the perfect harmony of mind, body and spirit.
Awesome!
Let's see you do it .
Ghun Phnug Gnouphl.
Snoggle, we don't have time for you to show off
The ape is strong, but more importantly it is flexible and free.
Who is this lady?
Here goes!
The wolf relies on it's enhanced senses to guide it...  He can hear what we cannot hear, he can smell what we cannot smell.
The frog remains still and silent while it assesses its target... then strikes out in the blink of an eye.
Show off.
The bear is sturdy as a towering tree.  Nothing can uproot it.
Girl, you've got to be kidding me.
The falcon never struggles with the air, but rather becomes one with it.
JOIN WITH THE FORCES OF NATURE!
You can do this.  You can do this.  You can do this...
... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers...
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
... We must try to communicate with them.
Perhaps if I could locate a vertical-deflector then I could assemble a holographic-comlink.
Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi .
Each of you must reach deep within and draw upon your natural instincts...  Only then will you know the way of the Ninjetti.  Rest for a few hours.  We will continue at daybreak.
So where are we supposed to sleep?
Buhph nghujr.
That guy's cruisin' for a bruisin'.
I can hardly walk...
I've never been this sore in my life.
Do you guys really think we can pull this off?
Maybe if we had more time.
... I wonder... We've been relying on our Morphin Powers for so long... maybe we've forgotten how to rely on ourselves.
We should get some rest.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simon says...  STOP!
Simon says... stand on one foot!
Simon says...
Quack like a'duck!
It just slipped out.
SHUT UP!!
You didn't say "Simon says".
Simon says SHUT UP!!!
This is the Iast time I use parents for anything!
Let's pick it up here!  I've got a schedule to keep.  In twenty four hours the ooze is gonna hit the fan!
Hey, boss!
What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky
How did you fare?
Oh, it couldn't've gone better. The Power Rangers didn't know what hit them .
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
So they've been destroyed?
"Basically".
What do you mean "basically"?
Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere!
Okay, maybe he wasn't so huge. But you should've seen the size of his STICKS
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
How'd you know?
Dulcea!  That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!
How could you let them get away?! If Dulcea leads them to the Great Power, everything will be ruined! They must be OBLITERATED!
What're you talking about?!  It wasn't my fault!  You're the featherbrains that let them get away!
I call upon the Powers of Darkness to enrich the evil of my creatures by tenfold!
And now the coup de grace, to lead my tribe to victorious battle!
Where does he come up with this stuff?
Queen Tengu, lead-your warriors to Phaedos, FEAST YOURSELVES UPON THE POWER RANGERS AND BRING ME DULCEA!
BUGHU PHUNGL MURHPUGNU!!!
How the heck?!...
What's going on?!
I don't believe it!
You have been visited by the animal spirits... they have given you their blessing.
OOZE!  OOZE!  OOZE!  OOZE!
Thank you!  Please!  You're too kind.  Finally. a little appreciation where it's deserved.
We love you Ivan!
Right back at ya!-  Now, WHO MISSES SCHOOL?!
NOT US!
AND WHO MISSES RULES?!
NOT US!
AND WHO WANTS TO JOIN ME IN RAISING HELL ACROSS  THE UNIVERSE?!
Can I have a word with you guys?  What's really going on here?! Where are everybody's parents?
Like we said before, that's classified, top secret...
Look, Ivan wants me to go dump a load of garbage all over them.
Well, why didn't you say so?!
They're at the World Center Construction Site.
Uh.   OOZE RULES!
Dulcea... how do you and Zordon know each other?
We belonged to an interstellar Peace Keeping Force known as the "Order of the Meledan".  Zordon was widely regarded as the finest Commander in the Galaxy. He was a true Legend... If it wasn't for him, the Universe would be a very different place from what it is today.
So...  what happened?
Over time our enemies were defeated...  I returned to Phaedos, Zordon moved on to continue the struggle elsewhere.  Until you kids showed up, I hadn't heard from him for centuries.
He was always an inspiration...
This is why I'm taking you to the Nathadian Monolith.  That is why I'm teaching you the Ninjetti.  If Zordon dies... then a piece of all of us dies... and the force of good within the Universe will be dealt an irreparable blow.
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
How about Major Moron?
How about the two of you shut Up and pay attention!!
What is THAT!
Feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric HORNITOR!  KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.  ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND THEN... THE WORLD
Dad...?!
We have to get out of here!
Dig... dig... dig...
Dad?!... It's me, Fred!
Dig... dig... dig...
Gotchya!
Just shut your gap!
Did I say anything?
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
 ... I just pray we're not too late.
Let's give it a whirl.
Angel Grove Police have been fielding hundreds of calls from concerned citizens as the number of missing gersons continues to grow
Hi, folks, Ivan Ooze here.
Ai,  yi,  yi,  yi,  yi
Are you bored with your work? Are you bored with your family Are you bored with your 1ife Well, come on down to Ooze City and LET'S GET STICKY!
The Monolith is there in the distance.
This is as far as I can take you.
You're leaving us?!
I have taught you all that I know.   Now you must achieve the Ninjetti on your own.
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
What's a Triac?
About twenty seconds in your time.
And how do we release the power?
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
What does that mean!
That is a question that even I cannot answer.  Remember, ten triacs.  After that something bad will happen.
Like...how bad?
They say the power will throw off a super-heated, radioactive fireball, instantly reducing you to ash and bits of charred bone.
That's pretty bad.
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
Ka'Alabas tor nartu En'Kata-Tay.  May your animals watch over you.
Finally, after centuries of waiting, my Ecto-Morphicon machines are ready to take on the world!
GET THAT THING OUT OF MY FACE!
Oh, man, that was a rental!
Mordant... let the ooze flow!
Goldar... the roof!
Looks like a fine day for raising HELL!
HECALE MENNIPUS LIBRI MAGUS!
Bullseye!
LIFE!!  Give my creatures LIFE!
This guy is the King!
PARENTS OF ANGEL GROVE.
YOU HAVE SERVED YOUR PURPOSE. NOW YOU WILL RETURN TO THE CONSTRUCTION SITE AND LEAP TO YOUR DEMISE!
What're you waiting for??...
What!
You forgot to say 'Simon says."
Man, these are the last guys I wanted to see.
Whadda we do now?
That's the only way to the Monolith...
We can take these guys!
LOOK OUT!
The frog silently assesses its target, then strikes out...
... in the blink of an eye.
Yo, Tweety!
The bear is sturdy as a towering tree.  Nothing can uproot it.
Bye, bye birdy.
Hasta la Pasta, Bigbird!
AIM FOR THEIR BEAKS!
It's up to you.
Polly wanna cracker?
ALL RIGHT, ROCKY!
WE DID IT!!
ANGEL GROVE... I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A COUPLE OF MY NEAREST AND DEAREST FRIENDS... HORNITOR!
And his trimetallic partner in crime... SCORPITRON!!
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
GO IVAN!!
LONG LIVE THE BOOGER MAN!
That should do it.  we won't be able to hear them, but they SHOULD be able to hear us.  Here goes.
... the Mayor has declared a state of emergency and asked that the city be immediately evacuated.  He has reiterated the need for everyone to remain calm.
Angel Grove has never before known such a crisis and we can now only pray for the swift arrival of the Power Rangers!
Ay, yi, yi, yi!
... Alpha, keep trying!
thru   OMITTED                                                   thru 75                                                               75
... The Nathadian Monolith...
I guess these guys weren't so lucky.
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
There should be a way to open it.
... Nothing.
Release the power with the power.
Not that kind of power.
... There has to be something we're missing.
It can't end like this...
What NOW!
Rangers... Ivan has invaded the city... time is running out...
Each of you are now in possession of miraculous skills... but only when the six become one will you have the strength to harness the Great Power.
ZORDON!!
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
Strength in numbers!!
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
I am the bear, stalwart and bold!
I am the frog, quick as lightning!
I am the mighty ape!
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
WE... ARE THE NINJETTI!!!
What HAPPENED?!
Where are we?!
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
That's twenty seconds!!
Release the power WITH the power.
What does that mean?!
Our SYMBOLS.
Ten seconds and counting!!
It's some kind of mirror!
Release the power with the power.
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
THREE SECONDS!!
LET'S DO IT!?
WE HAVE THE GREAT POWER!!
NEW POWER COINS!!
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
WE DID IT!!
HANG ON, ANGEL GROVE.
WE'RE ON OUR WAY!
Spherhlegnu.
Yes, Snoggle... they now have the Great Power of the Ninjetti!
There goes the neighborhood.
A real shame.
EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP!
You've been brainwashed!  This Ivan is no Wizard.  He's some kind of DEMON!
Shut up, squirt.
You can't talk that way about our leader.
You gotta believe me -- he's EVIL!
Listen to me!  Our parents are in danger!  If we don't help them they're going to be killed!
We could take it with us.
ALPHA?!
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
What?!
Zordon...  he's gone.
... This can't be...
"To those who possess the Great Power...   all things are possible."
ZORDON!!
Welcome back, kids.
It's good to be back.
HE'S ALIVE!  HE'S ALIVE!
We thought you...
It's good to see you again, too.
AI, YI, YI, YI, YI   Ivan s Ecto- Morphicon machines are leveling the city!
We've got news for you, Ivan...
The Power Rangers are BACK IN BUSINESS!!
 POWER RANGERS!

EVERYBODY ON BOARD!
Nice try,  Pinhead!
Somebody back me up, here!
These things are FEROCIOUS!
The bear kicks butt!
Heads up!
Hope you've got a good mechanic.
WE GOT HIM!!
 These brats are ruining EVERYTHING!
Let's TANGO!
We need Ninja MEGAZORD POWER, NOW!
GO, Rangers!  GO, Rangers!  GO, Rangers!  GO!
ACTIVATING NINJA MEGAZORD BATTLE MODE!
All systems go!
This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
ENGAGING KNUCKLE ROCKETS!
Don't make me LAUGH!
WHOOOAAAHH!!

What's he doing?!
Let's go after him!!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!

They're heading for the cliff!
That's gotta be an eighty foot drop!
Whadda we do?!
FOLLOW ME!!
We've got him locked!
Speed?
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
You call yourself a hell-hound?! A basset hound is more like it. If you were a real outlaw you would've gotten me out of this blizzard HOURS ago!
This is the last time I marry a witch.
It's Ivan and the Megazord!!
NOTHING can defeat the Powers of Darkness!
WE'RE BREAKING UP!
SLAM DANCE, ANYONE?!
He's on us!!
Wait a second...  What time is it?
Two thirty three a.m.
Ryan's Comet!!
What about it?
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
We get Ivan into the Comets PATH--
-- and KABOOOM -- he's space dust!
Come on!  Come on!
All right!
DAD!!
SKULL!!
BULK!!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
GO POWER RANGERS!
Have you hugged your Zord today?
WE'RE GOING TO IMPLODE!
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
thru   OMITTED                                                   thru 118A                                                             118A
Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!

THERE'S THE COMET!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
What're you doing?!
Taking care of business.
YEEOOOOOWWW!!!!
Bull's eye!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOUOOOO!!!!
MORPHENOMENAL!!
HOORAY, POWER RANGERS!!
That was a CHEAP shot!
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
Rangers, by going after the Great Power, all of you knowingly put your lives at extreme risk... and in so doing you not only saved my life, you saved all of Angel Grove and the world from a reign of unthinkable terror.
Everybody say cheese.
POWER RANGERS!!!
What'd we do?!
It's not what you DID, it's what you DIDN'T do!
We tried to rescue you every chance we had!
LIARS!
Ouch!!
Do you know what it's like to be stuck in a BLIZZARD FOR TWO DAYS?!
... Cold?
Are you trying to be funny?!
Hey, watch the hair!!!
