 Kirsty, come to daddy
 Ah, you're awake. Good.
Tell you what - we'll make a deal. I'll tell you what I know, then you tell me what you know.  O.K.?
O.K.?
Where am I?
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged - it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend... ?
Steve...
Don't worry. He's O.K.  We sent him home hours ago.  Jeez, what a story.
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
What are you talking about?  Who are you?
Oh, excuse me...
Ronson.  Homicide.  I'm this district's slash and dash expert. Made a career of the nasty ones. That's why I was at your Dad's house.  Jesus, what a mess.
Daddy...
Jesus...
Oh. shit...
We got two missing people and a house full of corpses.
Talk to me.
I thought Steve had talked to you?
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But - do me a favor? - none of this DEMONS crap.
He talked about Demons, huh?
Yeah.
It's true. All of it. It's all true.
Ronson.
Kucich here,sir.  We just found another one, though it suffered a little...
...er, accidental damage in discovery. Anyway, just about the only portable evidence we've got here - apart from human remains - is the mattress. Looks like someone was messed up real bad on it.
 Can we send it downtown?
What the hell are you asking me for?  Tag it.  Move it.
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
Shit!
We can bring them back properly more often than scientific orthodoxy dictates, ladies and gentlemen.  And the knife, far from the enemy of of analysis, is often its greatest ally in solving the puzzles of psychosis. Analysis isolates and massages. Surgery pinpoints and corrects. ... though you've got to know what you're doing, of course...
Some things are obvious. Here, for example, ...
...are the optical motor nerve control centers.
Now. This case. A deeply-buried psychosis severe enough to produce frighteningly frequent hysteria and aggression. Incurable. Say others. Not so. Analysis isolates. The knife exposes. Medication controls.
And then, ladies and gentlemen, we REBUILD. With all the care and knowledge that our years of training have given us ...
Dr. Malahide, the new arrival is awake, and appears very distressed.
My part in this is over.  You may tidy up for me.  Kyle, you come with me.
Easy, easy.  Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
I saw it...him.  But I got away. And I took the box.  And I solved it.  And they came.
Who?
The Cenobites.
The Demons.
Sorry.  Must get that door fixed.  Detective Ronson?
I am Doctor Malahide.
My assistant, Kyle Macrae.  And this must be Kirsty?
I've read the boy's statement. Quite the adventure they believe they had. I'd like to talk to her alone. Do you think ... ?
Mmmm.  O.K.  Frankly, I think she's more your territory than mine.  Shame.
Kirsty.  Doctor Malahide's going to look after you now.  Maybe we could talk some more tomorrow.
Wait!  The mattress.  You've got to destroy it.  She DIED on it, you see.  The mattress.  It's haunted now.  She can come back... like Frank. SHE CAN COME BACK.
The mattress ...
Uh...excuse me a moment.
Detective. I'll be able to help this girl. But I need your assistance ...
KYLE So...You're Kirsty, huh?
You a doctor, too?
Nearly a doctor. I'm Kyle Macrae. Call me Kyle.
Hi, Kyle.
Now, Kirsty...
The cop. He didn't believe me.
I suspect not. But that doesn't necessarily mean you're wrong, does it?
Do you believe me?
Well, I don't know yet. However, you're not lying. YOU believe this is the truth.
It IS the truth.
Well?
Sorry, Dr. Malahide. But it's Tiffany. She's escaped ... again.
Very Well.
I'm sorry, Kirsty. Kyle will come back with something to help you sleep. We shall speak tomorrow.
Oh, Jesus -she's gonna make it.
Tiffany. Come.
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. God, if anyone should know not to do that, it's me. I'm sorry. O.K.?
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
What's the matter with her?
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
God, that's terrible.
Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out.
Anyway, let's concentrate on you for a moment. Wanna suck on this for me?
Hey, good joke, Kyle. Do you always come on to the mentally ill?
Shit. Sorry. Here's the pills. Red face. Door. Bye.
Jesus, I'm glad I'm not paying for this place.
 Daddy...
 And how are we feeling today...?
Better? Good.
105 years and he still doesn't know my name.
 Get them off me. Get them off me.
I...I had a visitor.
What?
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's ...it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
 Kirsty, I'm sorry...  don't understand. I...
I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
Dr. Malahide. Yes. Look, I'll fetch him. You take it easy. I'm sure he can help.
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
If anyone can help, HE can.
Yeah? He got a ticket to Hell?
 Officer Kucich? Yes, Doctor Malahide. You've spoken to Ronson? Yes ... That's right. The mattress ... No, I'll meet you by the side entrance. No, no, my HOUSE. Yes, let me make that clear. The house, NOT the hospital. ... Yes ... Fine, and thank you.
Doctor Malahide ... ?
It must have been going on forever...
Kirsty...?
But the part I know about, That must have started with my Uncle Frank...
Then let us speak of it ...
Jesus Christ. Jee-sus-kerr-ist!
Oh, shit.
Get them off me. Get. Them. Off. Me.
Mr. Browning. Please, lie down.
Here. This will help.
 Jesus Christ!
Help me.
Help Me.
Don't be embarrassed. You're my friend.
Well?
Shit, Kyle. This is getting to be a habit. What is it, some kind of shock-therapy?
Oh, Jesus. What is it?
It's all true.
I'm cold.
Well?
Yes... Yes. You look...
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
No. You look...
Yes, I still like WINE ...
... and more.
Close it.
It's a beautiful dress...
I know.
There...
Well?
Well?
 Now all we need is a skin.
Yeah?
You O.K.?
Kirsty? You 0. K.?
No bad dreams.
So you slept O.K.?
As much as that bed of nails allowed.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
Like the robe?
I think I need to talk. About what I saw.
You thought I was crazy, didn't you?
Jesus, yes! What do you expect. I mean, God, I still do! It's just that now I'm crazy too.
And you're sure it was a woman?
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
What can I do? How can I save him?
The box. I need the box.
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
 What?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
What do you mean?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
I'm going.
Wait a minute. What do you mean, 'I'm going?' TO the HOUSE?
Get out of the way.
Are you crazy?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
WHY?
 Because I'm going to get my father!
I'm going to get my father.
Two seconds. Just two seconds. Don't move.
O.K. Let's go.
Kyle, you don't have...
I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
Wait! The .. thing ... I want to be sure it's not here.
Sssh. I think it's still here.
What? The...The thing?
Yes. I had to stop you going in there because I knew you'd cry out. Any normal person would. It ...It's just TERRIBLE.
Is it in there?
No. Not now.
Was I right? Is it terrible?
Yes. Yes, it's terrible.
Oh. You look awful.  You poor boy. Come here...
...Come to Mother ...
What's your name?
Kyle...
I'm JULIA.
Thank you, Kyle.
 Kyle...?
 Kyle?
Kirsty! How nice of you to drop in.
You have surprisingly good taste in men.
Kyle! No! I'll kill you, you...
Oh, you can try it, you little bitch. I'd love you to try it. But I'm not just the woman I was.
What, you mean you're something more than a whore with a vicious streak?
I mean I'm something more than human, you little shit!
Oh, Kirsty. They didn't tell you, did they? I'm afraid they've changed the rules of the fairy tale; I'm no longer just the wicked step-mother.
Now I'm the Evil Queen.
So come on; Take your best shot, Snow White.
 Julia!
You're sure this is what you want?
It's what I've ALWAYS wanted. A view of ... beyond.
You were almost enough, Julia but...I have to see. I have to KNOW.
Oh, I quite understand.
She's done it.
She certainly has.
It's coming.
It certainly is.
Wait.
No.
No?
No.
It is not HANDS that call us...
... It is DESIRE.
Oh, shit.
NO!
Wait. Wait.
Hey, remember me? From the hospital? I was in the next room?
You don't want to go down there. You REALLY don't want to go down there.
Jesus Christ.
Tiffany. Wait!
Tiffany! Don't trust it! Don't Trust it!
Do be careful.
Mommy...
Nooooo!
Ah, Kirsty. And we thought we'd lost you.
So sweet of you to come back.
How can it send us back, child? We're already here. And so are you.
No! You... You can't! It wasn't me...I didn't do it! I didn't open the box!
Didn't open the box. And what was it last time? Didn't know what the box was. And yet we DO keep finding each other, don't we?
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
Then why are you here?
I've come for my father!
But he's in his own Hell, child And quite unreachable.
I don't believe you!
But it's true, He is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
And what about you?
It's different for us.
We've always been here.
We have no more surprises.
But, please; feel free. Explore. We'll always be here...
... we have Eternity to know your flesh!
Come. I have such sights to show you.
Do you see? You were RIGHT. This IS a puzzle, too. But WE'RE CAUGHT in the puzzle.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Yeah!
Enough. God, that's enough. We HAVE to go back.
Go back? What an earth makes you think we can go back?
I want to go back!
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
Kirsty!
 Daddy...?
Tiffany. Wait here. If I'm not back real soon - get out. Get home.
daddy...
Daddy. It's Kirsty...
Oh God.
No. Over here. Behind the screen.
Daddy... ?
That's it, baby. Come to Daddy.
NO!
What's the matter, Kirsty? It's only Frank. It's only Uncle Frank.
I should have known! I should've known he wouldn't be here! This place is only for filth like you!
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
Yes!
Shit. Bull. Shit
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all.
You're full of shit, Frank Cotton. My Dad wasn't like that at all. He could feel. He could love. He loved ME.
He...he loved me.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
He loved me, you bastard! He Loved me, he loved my mother. He even loved that bitch you betrayed him with!
Ah, Julia. She hasn't been to see me recently. That's why it's so nice to have you here, baby. Daddy's little girl. So pretty when she's upset. Come to Daddy,
Now don't be naughty, Kirsty. Or I'll have to punish you first. Perhaps you'd like that. Would you like that?
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter, you bastard!
No! No! Julia! Help me!
But you WANTED this. You wanted to SEE. You wanted to KNOW. And here it is. The heart of Hell. Leviathan.
Why do you think I was allowed to go back? For YOU? No, it wanted souls. And I brought you. And you wanted to KNOW. Now you're both happy.
Goodbye, Doctor. It's been real.
How convenient.
Stay there, baby. Don't come in.
Yes. Stay there. I'll be with you in a minute.
Frank...
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
 Julia.
 Frank.
I knew you'd come.
You knew?
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Oh, I do. I do.
And I know how much I mean to you. Come here.
Come here. Kiss me. And then...
... we'll have a real family re-union.
Jesus Christ, FRANK. I don't believe you. You don't know her at all do you? You still think you're in charge.
Of course I am. She BELONGS to me.
For God's sake! He KILLED you!
She's forgiven me that. Haven't you?
Do you really need to ask?
Show them.
Just a small inconvenience, babe.
Jesus!  Out.  Out!
Wait a minute.  Why are we following her? Who is this?
This is Tiffany
... She's good at puzzles.
Fine.
Nothing personal, babe.
Oh. My. God.
Tiffany, listen.  You've solved it. But we've got to solve it the OTHER way.  See?  See? We've got to get out.
Come on!
Please!  Tiffany, Please! Get us out!  Take us home, please!
Malahide ...
Jesus Christ!  Of course ...
And to think I hesitated ...
Tiffany. Come. I have a whole new world of puzzles for you to enjoy ...
A whole new world of pleasures for you to endure.
No.  I've had enough of this shit. Who the hell are you?
It's ...
Never mind.  Never mind.
Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.
O.K.  You've done it before.  You can do it again.  GET US OUT OF HERE!
beautiful flowers.
No. Come on. We have to get out of here.
Oh, poor Larry.  You never could hold on to anything for very long, could you?
NOOOOOOOOOO!
My God, it's her room!
Let's go!
No. No, there's something wrong...
Jesus. O.K. No more arguments. Just RUN!
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go!!
Tiffany ... ?
But these were ... Daddy?
These flowers. I saw them just...
...the day ...before... yesterday Daddy? Daddy!
Daddy!
Get help.
Pass me a pillow.
What do you do? I just don't know what to do.
Coronary arrest. Let's be quick.
Is he going to be 0.K.?
We just can't say. O.R.'s on standby. They'll do what they can.
But it's bad?
 Yeah. It's bad.
Wait out here. A doctor will talk to you when we know more.
Is he going to be all right?
Wh...
Oh, Fuck.
C'mon. C'MON!
COME ON!!
Faster, you bastard, faster!
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
It's 0.K. They can't beat an elevator. Not upstairs. It'll be O.K.
It'll be O.K.
This way. Short cut.
Oh, Christ. This isn't just personal anymore.
The Doctor is in!
Oh, shit.
I recommend amputation.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Time to play.
Wait!
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
Nonsense, I...
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
Enough!
Wait!
I...remember.
You were ALL human!
Tiffany. Come.
Tiffany. Come.
Leave her alone, you asshole!
Oh,good. A fight.
So what, girls? It's O.K. for an ego-trip but it doesn't got the job done.
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
 What are you talking...
 I've got to finish it.
Finish what?
Tiffany! Wait!
Oh, gross.
What are you doing? What are WE doing?
I can't do it here. I have to go to it.
I'm scared.
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
Ah, girls. And how are we feeling today?
You have your whole lives behind you now.
Tiffany! No!
Surgery is open, Tiffany. What was today's agenda?
Ah, yes. Evisceration.
Doctor. I've missed you.
I knew you'd come back.
I'm a girl who keeps her promises.
Do it, Tiffany! Do it!
Trust me.
So. What're you going to do? Open up a games-shop somewhere? Sell jigsaw puzzles?
Oh, yeah.
Well ... G'bye.
It's been Hell.
So whose was all this shit?
Not our problem...
... Gimme a hand with this.
I'm Julia. Love me.
