Where were you, Jason?
In the car.         Conklin up front.
I'll get the book.
No.    There's nothing new.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --               *
-- it hasn't been two years --                            *
-- it's alwa   ys bad and it's    never                   * anything but    bits and piece   s anyway!                * * You ever thi   nk that maybe i   t's just                 * making it wo   rse? You don't     wonder that?            *
We write them down because sooner or                      * later you're going to remember something                  * good.                                                     *
 I do remember something good.       All the time. I remember you.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
I worry when you get like this.
It's just a nightmare.
I don't mean that.   I worry when you try to ignore it.
Sleep.   Sleep now.
I should be better by now.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
But it ends up the same.
One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
BOURNE slowing as he reaches the corner --
And your question, sir?
She's my sister. There's been a death in the family. This is the last place we know she called from.
Crowded with tourists -- sunbathers -- MARIE at her favorite spot. Talking with TWO WOMEN, laughing with them - - happy.
We gotta go, Marie.       We gotta go, now.
We're blown.
No...     How?
The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.
We pushed it. We got lazy.                                 *
But you're sure?
He was at the campground yesterday.
So...                                                  *
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and                  * hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
That's crazy.                                          *
No.  Not thi   s. This is real.                        * * And he's rig   ht there...                             * (throw   ing the car into rever   se)
Where --
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai --              * silver --                                              *
...but you're not -- you're not sure...                 *
We can't wait to be sure.                               *
I don't want to move again...I like it                  * here.                                                   *
Loo   k, we clear out, we get to the shack,             * we    get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll              * com   e back. I'll check it out. But right              * now    we can't --                                      *
-- where's left to go? --                               *
-- there's places -- we can't afford to                 * be wrong!                                               *
You drive.                                            *
What?                                                 *
* Switch! You drive!                                    *
-- where? --                                          *
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --              *
-- Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
-- not yet --
-- it's just him? --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
-- hang on --
You keep going to the shack.    I'll meet              * you there in an hour.                                  *
* Where are you going?                                   *
I'm going to bail on the other side and                * wait. This bridge is the only way he can               * follow.                                                *
What if it's not who you think it is?                  *
If he crosses the bridge, it is.                       *
There must be another way!                             *
I warned them, Marie.    I told them to                * leave us alone.                                        *
Jason, please don't do this...it won't                 * ever be over like this.                                *
There's no choice.                                     *
At the end make the left, when I roll out              * do not slow down.                                      *
I love you, too.                                       *

And the Germans can't match it?
Nobody's got it. We checked every database we could access. Nothing.
Show her the other thing.
This is a KG       B file that must've fallen somehow and        then slipped under, I guess, a desk there,        or... 
Do we know what this says?
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
PAMELA/PHONE Ward?
Yes?
Pamela Landy.
What can I do for you, Pam?
I was hoping you had some time for me.
Time for what?
I'm free right now actually.
That sounds ominous. Let me check my schedule.
Treadstone.
Never heard of it.
That's not gonna fly.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay- grade.
Tha    t's a warrant from Director Marshall gra    nting me unrestricted access to all per    sonnel and materials associated with Tre    adstone.
And what are we looking for?
I want to know about Treadstone.

What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
So what's yo   ur theory?  Conklin's re   aching out from the grave to protect his    good name?  The man is d   ead.
 No one's disputing that, Ward.
For crissake, Marty, you knew Conklin. Does this scan? I mean, at all?
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam.       What are you selling?
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved.                * 
And that wha   tever information I was going            * to buy in Be   rlin, it was big enough to               * make Bourne    come out from wherever he's              * been hiding    to kill again.                           * * How's that s   can?                                     *

There's only a Consulate, they sent a                  * field officer out half an hour ago --                  *

Alright, Mr.    Bourne, is that your name?  Name's Nevin   s. I'm with the US Consulate. Could I see    your passport?
So, Mr. Bourne...
What are you doing in Tangiers?
 Are you travelling alone?                              *
* Look, I don't know what you've done.                * But, you're gonna need to play ball here.           *

 Yes...
Then use extreme caution. He can be very            * unpredictable and violent. Use whatever             * means necessary to...                               *
Okay, I'll call you right back.
Hello?
Mr. Nevins?
Who's this?
Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?                     *
I think... I think he got away.                             *
Have you locked down the area?                              *
Ah, we're in Italy. They don't exactly                      * "lock down" real quick...
How long have you worked for the agency?
Me?    Four years.
If    you ever    want to make it    to five, you   're gonna    listen to me r   eal close. Jas   on Bourne    is armed and e   xtremely dan   gerous.     A week ago, he    assassinated two    men in B   erlin, one of w   hom was a               * hig   hly-exper   ienced field of   ficer...                * 
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??                                               *
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
I'm    getting    on a plane to B   erlin in 45               * min   utes, whi   ch means you ar   e going to call           * me    back in 3   0, and when I a   sk you where we           * sta   nd, I had    better be impr   essed. My                 * mob   ile numbe   r is...                                     *
Berlin!                                                       *
I've already got a team there. I doubt                        * Bourne's in Naples to settle down and                         * raise a family.                                               *
You don't know what you're getting into                       * here.                                                         *

"Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous..."
 "...a week ago he assassinated two men in Berlin, one a highly..."
So your cover at the time was what?
That I was an American student in Paris.
What exactly did your job with Treadstone in Paris consist of?
Ih    ad two re   sponsibilities. One was     to coo   rdinate l   ogistical operations. Th    e oth   er was to    monitor the health of th   e age   nts, to m   ake sure they were up to    date wit   h their m   edications.
Health, meaning what?
Their mental health.       Because of what they'd been through.       They were prone to a variety of problems.
* What kind of problems?
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Amnesia?                                                   *
Before this?        Before Bourne?   No.
Were you familiar with the training program?
The details? No. I mean,         I was told it was voluntary. I don't kno       w if that's true or not, but that's wha      t I was told.  Look, they took vulnerable       subjects, okay? You mix that with th       e right pharmacology and some serio      us behavior modification, and, I don't       know, I mean, I guess anything's possible      .
The jet's ready.                                     * * There's a car for you.                               *
Good luck.                                           *
You were his local contact. You were                 * with him the night Conklin died. You're              * coming with us.                                      *
I'm    curious    about Bourne.     Your             * You    have spe   cific training    in the ide   ntificati   on and diagnosi   s of psy   chologica   l conditions?
Am I a doctor, no, but...
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
Believed what?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
So he fooled you.
 If you say so.                                       *
* Not    good eno   ugh. You're the person who         * flo   ated this    amnesia story.                    * * Eve   r feel so   rry for him? For what he'd bee   n through   ?
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
 You mean, did I want a date?
Did you?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Some women like Dobermans --
What do you want from me?       I was reassigned. I'm out.                                 *

--    so far Bourne's had no contact with              * any   one on the list -- Langley pulled an             * ima   ge out of Naples, it's uploading right now   .
Coming in now...
 Is it him?
He's not hiding, that's for sure.
Why Naples?     Why now?
Could be random.
Maybe he's running.
On his own passport?
 What's he actually doing?
What's he doing? He's making his first mistake...
It's not a m   istake.  They don't m   ake mistakes. And they don't do random.     There's always an objective,           * always a tar   get.                                   * * If he's in N   aples, on his own passport,            * there's a re   ason.                                  *

 So why didn't you kill me then?                        *
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
What do you want?
Conklin.
He's dead.
Try again.
Shot dead in Paris.       Dead the night you walked out.
Then who runs Treadstone?
Nobody. They shut it down. We're the last two. It's over... 
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
I don't know.
Who sent you to Greece?
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
Pamela Landy?
I don't know who that is.
What's going on in Berlin?
I don't know! Why would I lie?
What the hell did you do? You must have really screwed up.

What do you have, Danny?
 You     put a fo   ur-gam Kel on h   ere and it's gon    na take o   ut power to the    building. You kno    w that.     What you can't    know, is if it'    s gonna b   low the room wi   th it.
And?
The   re were t   wo charges, they were supposed to    go off si   multaneously. The second one, the    one that    didn't go off, was down her   e...  Fir   st of all   , this is nothi   ng, it's a sub- lin   e for the    breaker above.     Second, why put    the char   ge all the way    down here? If you   're good    enough to get i   n here and han   dle the g   ear, you're goo   d enough to kno   w you don   't need this.  Bou   rne would   know.
It was staged?
Is it a slam dunk?         No, but...
Jesus...
 Oka   y. What     if someone decided to cover the   ir tracks    by blaming Conklin and Bou   rne. Wha    t if Bourne didn't have any   thing to    do with this?
Keep going...
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Lots of people...
Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
Who else knows about this?
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Show me again...
Okay... 
Guten Abend.
 Guten Abend.
 Can I help you?
Sir?  Do you have a reservation?
No.  Sorry.     I just got in...  I -- Is room    645 available?  I stayed the   re before. My wife and I.
I'm sorry, that room is occupied. Would room 644 be okay, it's just across the hall...

 Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
I want to look at the room.                          * * Check it out.                                        *

He let her go? Great. Where's Danny?                 * He should head over there and debrief                * her.                                                 * * What's here? What was he doing?                      *
We don't know. They're in a room upstairs. I was told to wait down here.

Oh, God...   It must have been Bourne.             *
Did he say anything to you?
No... It must have been Bourne.
We'll know for sure when we get the                * security tapes.                                    *

Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.

What?
He left yest   erday on the night train. He's probabl   y just getting in now.  You'll have    to hurry.

Good luck.

Yes.    Now...
Sit down.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.

Why not?    It was just money.                          *

No good options left?                                     *

You know I'm not.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Look at me.
I should kill you...if it's true you should die...I should kill you now!
I can't let you do that either.                       *
Because you're afraid!
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
I have to go now.                                     *
Is this really happening?                             *
 I'm sorry.
Hello, David.                                           *
Where am I?
Ramstein Air    Base, Germany.                          *  Before the w   all fell you would have woken up in a Russ   ian prison hospital.
Oh, shit...
Careful...                                              *
Why am I alive?
Are you disappointed?
I know who you are.
Thank you for your gift.    I'm sorry about Marie.    *

Do you think you can read?     Are you well           * enough?                                               *
It's all in here. Treadstone.      A summary of your life. All of it.
Don't need it. I remember everything. PAMELA  Sounds like a threat.
You didn't answer my question.
Why you're a   live?  You're alive    because you're special. Because she    kept you alive.  Because we w   ant you back on our side.
Take a look at it. We'll talk later.
* Let's give him half an hour.                        *
