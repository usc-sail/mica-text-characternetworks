And that's cricket, hon.
You want it?
Sure.
Doesn't matter if you don't.
Jody won't be offended. Jody's never offended. What'd you say your name was?
Jude.
Jude. Suits you, Jude.
The teddy bear?
No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
Gotta piss, Jude.
Don't run off, Jude.
You don't know me, do you?
 What if I did?
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
You didn't?
And you know what?
Tell me, Jody
It's nice.
Not here.
Who gives a fuck.
You never know.
I never know nothing.
People. They could be looking.
Come and get me, soldier --
Whatever you say, Jude...
What the fuck --
So what's your name, soldier?
Fuck you.
Yeah.
The situation is simple. You're being held hostage by the Irish Republican Army. They've got one of our senior members under interrogation in Castleraigh. We've informed them that if they don't release him within three days, you'll be shot. You'll be treated as our guest until further developments. Have you anything to say?
Give him a cup of tea.
Do you want a cup of tea?
See does he want some.
Do you want some food?
Hey -- what's he like?
Horny bastard.
Did you give him it?
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
Have a look at him.
Can't.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
He's all right.
Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.
You fucking bitch -- you fucking whore --
Turn the fucking thing off --
You all right?
Fucking animal.
You don't know that.
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
Tough work, that.
Someone's got to do it.
Nah, it was a breeze. Just thought of you.
And you know what, Fergus? One of you made me want it...
Which one?
Eat something, would you?
Can't.
What do you mean you can't?
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
This is a farce, man.
How is it a farce?
I seen your fucking face.
So, what do I look like?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
Am I?
Yeah. And the brown eyes.
You're the handsome one.
Thank you, handsome.
My pleasure.
I can't fucking breathe, man. Be a Christian, will you?
Tell him to take the hood off, honey...
How did you know it was her?
I can smell her perfume.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
It was fun while it lasted.
Nice lady.
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
Can't we take it off?
Have to check with himself.
You look after him.
Don't leave me with her, man. She's dangerous...
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Why would you do that?
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
So?
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
You sure?
He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
Tommy --
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
Thanks.
It's your decision.
Leave us, Judie.
My pleasure.
Thank you, soldier.
Never thought fresh air would taste this good.
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
No fucking way.
Only joking.
You know, I was wrong about one thing.
What's that?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
No?
Nope. Not handsome at all.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
No. It's the truth.
Well, I could say the same about you.
Could you?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
So I've noticed.
Hey --
What is it now?
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
Do what?
Kill me.
What makes you think that?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
They won't let him die.
You want to bet?
I'm not a gambling man.
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
Why can't we?
Not in your nature.
What do you know about my nature?
I'm talking about your people, not you.
What the fuck do you know about my people?
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
And you know the funny thing?
No, what's the funny thing?
I didn't even fancy her.
Didn't look like that to me...
She's not my type.
C'mere.
No.
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
What?
My inside pocket.
Take out the wallet.
Open it.
Inside. There's a picture.
No, not that one. There's another.
Now she's my type.
She'd be anyone's type.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Why not?
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
No?
Absolutely not.
She your wife?
Suppose you could say that.
You make a nice couple.
Don't I know it.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
She's a friend of mine
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
What?
What the fuck am I doing here.
What the fuck were you doing here?
I got sent.
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
Why did you sign up?
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Shouldn't take it personally.
 "Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
And you play cricket?.
Best game in the world.
Ever see hurling?
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Best game in the world.
Never.
The fastest.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
How different?
Toffs' game there. But not at home.     .
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
I'll bear that in mind.
And by the way, it's not Paddy. It's Fergus.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
My pleasure, Jody
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.
Tree.
You've got to loosen my hands.
Can't.
Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
Come on, man, I'm going to wet my pants!
Take the fucker out, man, I'm dying --
I gotta lean forward or I'll dribble all over myself. Will you hold my hands for me.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Hurry up, would you?
These things take time, Fergus.
It's amazing how these small details take on such importance...
Now put it back in.
Give us a break.
I can't do it! It's only a piece of meat. For fuck's sake, it's got no major diseases.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Shut up, would you?
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.
Fergus?
Yeah?
Thanks. I know that wasn't easy for you.
The pleasure was all mine.
What the fuck is this?
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
Yeah. Get some sleep.
Did he talk?
Didn't make you laugh?
Here. Have some breakfast.
Good morning, Fergus?
So he knows your name?
I told him.
Are you all there?
Back in a minute, Jody
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Yes.
And do you know why?
Why?
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
They giving you trouble, Fergus?
It happens. Y'see, there's two kinds of people. Those who give and those who take.
Ah, take the thing off, man.
It's okay. I understand. Don't mind if I prattle on, do you?
I will take it by your silence that you don't.
Two types, Fergus. The scorpion and the frog. Ever heard of them?
Scorpion wants to cross a river, but he can't swim. Goes to the frog, who can, and asks for a ride. Frog says, "If I give you a ride on my back, you'll go and sting me." Scorpion replies, "It would not be in my interest to sting you since as I'll be on your back we both would drown." Frog thinks about this logic for a while and accepts the deal. Takes the scorpion on his back. Braves the waters. Halfway over feels a burning spear in his side and realizes the scorpion has stung him after all. And as they both sink beneath the waves the frog cries out, "Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion, for now we both will drown?" Scorpion replies, "I can't help it, it's in my nature."
So what's that supposed to mean?
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Why?
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
See? I was right about you.
Don't be so sure.
Jody's always right.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Doesn't matter where.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Having a pint in the Rock.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Like what?
Like having a pint in the Metro --
Having two pints in the Rock.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
Who's Dil?
My special friend.
Oh, yeah.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
The best.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Do you?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
We don't look on it like that.
I've often wondered how you do it.
Depends on what you believe in.
What do you believe in?
That you guys shouldn't be here.
It's as simple as that?
Yes.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
He's hot.
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
Have you no feelings, woman?
You shut your face --
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
He's a good soldier, Jude.
I said shut the fuck up --
He believes in the future --
Is it bad?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
I didn't.
Some kinds of women are...
She can't help it.
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
You liked her?
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
Don't know her.
Want you to do something, Fergus.
What?
If they kill me --
Don't think that way.
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
See if she's all right.
I don't know her.
Take her picture. C'mere.
Take it. In the inside pocket.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
I told you not to talk that way --
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
Stop it --
Volunteer?
We need you inside.
We've had word. They've used every trick in the book on him. He's starting to talk. You're going to have to do it in the morning.
You OK about that?
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.
Not the only one --
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
Peter.
What?
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
Why do you want to do that for?
Would make me feel better about it.
You sure about that?
I'm sure.
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
Don't.
I'm sorry.
Help me.
How can I?
I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
Don't even smoke, you know that? It just seemed the right thing to do.
Go to sleep now.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
What?
A story.
Like the one about the frog?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
When I was a child...
Yeah?
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
What does that mean?
Nothing.
Tell me something, anything.
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
Me? No, I'm not good for much...
Stand up, now --
I wish to say on behalf of the Irish Republican Army --
Leave him be --
Take the hood off, Fergus --
No.
I want to see a bit. Please, please. Don't make me die like an animal.
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
Why?
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Stop that talk now --
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
The fastest.
Faster than cricket?
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
You won't run.
But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back --
JODY!!!
You stupid bastard --
What you say, faster?
I said you bastard -- stop --
Got to catch me first --
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
Hurling --
What?
Hurling --
Come on, Fergie -- you can do it -- a bit more wind --
Bit of fun, Fergus, eh?
Told you I was fast --
Don't do it.
Fergus!
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
That's wise, Tommy.
All right, then. I like to be wise.
So what do you need, Fergus?
Need to go across the water.
Do you now.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Aha.
There's a man I know ships cattle to London.
We're closing. I'll see you tomorrow, Dil
You want something in particular?
Just a bit of a trim...
Come on...
Someone recommend you?
In a way.
Who?
Guy I work with.
What's his name?
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
What's it to you?
Nothing.
You American?
No.
Not English.
No.
Scottish?
How'd you guess?
The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?
Like treacle.
Nice laugh.
That should make her happy.
Who's she?
Don't know. Who is she?
Hi, Dil
Hiya, hon.
What'll it be?
A bottle of Guinness.
See that, Col?
See what, Dil?
He gave me a look.
Did he?
Just cut his hair, you know.
Yeah?
What you think?
Nice.
There, he did it again.
Saw that one.
What would you call it?
Now, that was a look.
Ask him to ask me what I'm drinking.
She wants to know do you want to know what she's drinking.
A margarita.
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
He's Scottish, Col.
Scottish?
Yeah.
What'd he say, Col?
He agreed that he was.
What do you think his name is?
I've no thoughts on the subject.
Jimmy.
Jimmy?
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Hi, Jimmy.
Hiya, Dil
Sing the song, Dil --
Fuck off, Dave.
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
So Pat's a cricket fan, eh?
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as you remember you're not at Lords.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
Is that good or bad?
Well, you get to say, The usual, Col. Things like that.
So let's call this the usual.
Thanks.
No, no. It's on me.
Take it out, if you want.
You came to see her, didn't you?
Something I should tell you. She's --
She's what?
She's on.
He's still looking, Col.
Persistent.
Good thing in a man.
An excellent quality.
Maybe he wants something.
I would expect he does.
Ask him.
Ask him yourself.
So tell me.
Everybody wants something.
Not me.
Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col?
You old-fashioned?
Must be.
Got the money, Dil?
Fuck off, Dave.
You fucking promised.
Did I?
You fucking did.
Didn't you? Well, come on!
It takes all types.
So who's he?
He's what she should run a mile from.
Then why doesn't she?
Who knows the secrets of the human heart.
Don't be like that --
You heard me --
Got very fucking grand, haven't we --
Talk to me, you stupid bitch --
Hi.
Hi. You forgot your bag.
Thank you.
Who the fuck is he?
Jimmy.
It's him, isn't it?
Maybe.
See, they get the wrong idea.
 Cunt.
What was that?
They all get the wrong idea.
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Charming.
What'll I do?
Break his neck.
No, don't.
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
Cunt.
Come on, honey.
You all right?
Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
Perform?
You know.
You on the game?
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
He's getting up.
You can't leave me then, can you?
You want me to ask you in, right?
No, I didn't --
But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap.
Fucking dumb dyke carrot cunt.
If you kissed me, it would really get his goat.
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
Where?
Half-five. At Millie's.
Give me that look again.
What look?
The one you gave me in the Metro.
Darling, you shouldn't have.
What's that about?
They're jealous.
Why?
I wonder.
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
Like what?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Must be.
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
How special?
You want one?
Jesus Christ!
Jesus.
That Dave?
The things a girl has to put up with.
I'm frightened, Jimmy. That's not like him.
Piss off, Dave!
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
I'm not on my own, am I?
Come on up, would you?
Won't hurt you to come in.
Would you like a drink?
Yes, please.
What'll it be?
Whiskey.
Someone out there.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
It's Dave.
Talk to me, Dil --
Sure, Dave --
Please, Dil --
Take your clothes.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!
Fucking mad!
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
You fucking bitch!
Murderer!
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
Must be in love to manage that.
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
He lived here with you?
Tried to. Sit down, will you?
What about him?
He was different.
How different?
As different as it's possible to be.
Tell me about him.
No.
Shouldn't I go?
Yes.
No --
Did you do that to him?
You want to know how I kissed him?
Yes...
Are you jealous of him?
Maybe.
That's good...
What would he think?
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
Do you miss him?
What do you think?
I think you do.
 You say that like a gentleman.
Do I?
Like you're concerned.
But you can t stay, you know that?
Didn't think I could.
A real gentleman...
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
I am.
Look, I'm sorry.
Fuck off, Dave.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
I was only going to ask her for a dance.
Shall we?
Did he come here too?
Is this an obsession of yours?
Maybe.
He did sometimes.
Did he dance with you?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
Want to look after you.
What does that mean?
Something I heard someone say once.
You mean that?
Yeah.
Why?
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
You're not having me on, are you? 'Cause Dil can't stand that.
No.
And she does get very upset...
One for him, too.
Drink.
What is this?
I'm superstitious. Drink.
Can't leave me now.
Aha.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Depends what it is.
No, depends on nothing.
In one.
What you thinking of, hon?
I'm thinking of your man.
Why?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Told you, I'm superstitious.
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
All the time.
Even now.
No...
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
Give me one minute.
Would he have minded?
You did know, didn't you?
Oh my God.
Jesus. I feel sick --
Don't go, Jimmy --
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.
What were you doing in the bar if you didn't know -- I'm bleeding...
It's all right, Jimmy. I can take it. Just not on the face.
Y'see, I'm not a young thing any longer.... Funny the way things go. Don't you find that, Jimmy? Never the way you expected.
I'm sorry.
You mean that?
Don't go like that. Say something...
Jesus.
He's back, Col
Hi.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Stop it, Dil --
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
I'm sorry.
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Dil --
Tell him it hurt --
I have to talk to her, Col --
Says he's got to talk to you --
Come on, Dil --
Where?
Tell him again, Col. Go fuck himself --
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.
Sorry.
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
Not in my experience.
Off his wages.
Do you mean that?
He wants to know do I mean that.
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Bloody right I do...
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
She's not a tart.
No, of course not, she's a lady.
She's not that either.
Darling --
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
What you doing here?
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Don't call me that.
Sorry, darling.
Give it over, Dil --
Apologies, my sweet.
That's more like it, dear. Have a cuppa.
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
Never said a truer word.
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
Must be.
And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.
You could?
Do you care, Jimmy?
Sure I do.
You mean that?
Yeah. I care, Dil.
You crying, Dil?
I'm tired and emotional.
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
What?
Whatever it is she does for you.
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
Did you ever pick your teeth up with broken fingers?
What's that supposed to mean?
It's a simple question.
Come on, dear.
He didn't answer, honey --
Sorry about that, Mr. Deveroux.
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
Shut up.
Made me feel all funny inside.
I said stop it.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
You think that's wise?
Nothing's wise.
I didn't mean to hit you.
I know that.
Kind of liked you as a girl.
That's a start.
So I'm sorry.
Make it up to me, then.
How?
Ask to meet me again.
Will you meet me again?
When?
Whenever. Tonight.
Do they know?
Know what, honey?
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
Details, baby, details.
So they do know.
All right, they do.
Don't.
Sorry.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Probably.
Kind of wish I didn't.
You can always pretend.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Absolutely.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Are you pretending yet?
I'm working on it.
There's Dave. He knew too.
Stop it, Jimmy.
Am I becoming repetitious?
A little.
Sorry.
Don't ask me in.
Please, Jimmy.
No. Can't pretend that much.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Should have stayed a girl.
Don't be cruel.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Only if you kiss me.
Happy now?
Delirious.
Hello, stranger.
You vanished.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Leave me alone, Jude.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
I heard.
Eddie and Tinker died.
I know.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
Suits you.
Aye, I was sick of being blond. Needed a tougher look, if you know what I mean.
Fuck me, Fergus.
Am I to take it that's a no?
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
So you did fuck up.
Yes.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
No, what is the thing?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
What do you mean?
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
You're never out, Fergus.
Maybe you don't care whether you die or not. But consider the girl, Fergus. The wee black chick.
Leave her out of this.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
And I must admit I'm curious.
What the fuck do you know, Jude?
You fucking tell me, boy --
She's nobody. She likes me.
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
Keep the faith.
He your boyfriend?
Lucky you.
Carnations.
What?
He'd bring me carnations.
So I got it wrong, then.
Not at all, honey.
Don't.
Okay.
Come on.
Why, honey --
Come on.
You gonna tell me why?
No.
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong
Not here.
You gonna tell me what it is?
What was it?
You know her, Jimmy?
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
Dil, this is Jude.
You following me?
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
It's her, isn't it?
What's her?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
Kind of.
I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really sorry.
You see that, Col?
Saw it, Dil.
Fuck it, is what I say.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Fucking men, Col --
Fuck 'em.
And fuck you, Jimmy --
You could always make it up to her.
How?
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
She's not a girl, Col --
Whatever you say.
She went that way --
But you come with me.
So it was you all the time.
Who'd you think it was?
I thought it was Dave.
And who's Dave when he's at home?
He's at home.
Should blow you away, you know that?
I know that.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
I understand.
Fuck you, too --
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
That true, Fergus? You in love?
Absolutely.
And what's she like between the sheets?
Definitely unusual.
And who is she?
Just a girl.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Aye, I do, Peter.
Good.
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
A hotel?
It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond.
Who is he?
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Thank God for that.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Hope not.
Good. So what do you think?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
Right.
So it's on the street.
Right.
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Of course. I forgot.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
You keep your mind on the job, boy --
And then you'll leave her out of it?
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
He's arthritic. Takes him two minutes to get to the door.
And what if I say no?
You know what. Go.
Pardon me, young man --
You were made for this.
Was I?
Perfect.
And what happens then?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
And what if you don't?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
You may be right.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
Jude?
Yes?
Who's the old geezer?
Some judge...
Why'd you follow me, Dil?
Was jealous, Jimmy.
Shouldn't be, Dil
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
Don't. My makeup.
She own you, Jimmy?
Yes.
She from Scotland too?
You could say that.
And you're not going to tell me more?
I can't.
What you doing, Jimmy?
I'm not sure.
Do you like me even a little bit?
More than that.
Come on, let's go for a walk.
You do something for me, Dil?
Anything.
You'd do anything for me?
Afraid so.
You got the keys to the shop?
You want another haircut, baby?
No. Sit down.
You'd do anything for me?
Anything.
No way --
You said anything, Dil
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
Want to change you to a man, Dil...
Why?
It's a secret.
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
Yes.
And you wouldn't leave me?
No.
You promise?
I promise.
Go on, then.
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
I'm sorry.
You want to make me look like him...
No. Want to make you into something new. That nobody recognizes...
Don't recognize myself, Jimmy.
No.
Better in the dark.
So it's true, then?
What?
You like me better like this.
Yes.
Oh, Jimmy --
No. No. Dil... get up...
Baby...
What are you doing, honey...
Don't call me that --
Sorry. What you doing?
Try this on, Dil
Why?
For me.
For you...
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Look on it like a honeymoon.
You a handyman, Fergie?
I take pride in my work.
I sincerely hope so.
Tools of the trade.
And forget about the girl.
Dil?
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
I'm going home!
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
I had to go to work!
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
Come on...
No! I'm going home...
So tell me.
I was trying to get out of something.
No! Tell me everything, Jimmy.
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
You mean that?
Yes.
Stop it, would you?
Give it over, Dil, for fuck's sake --
Sorry. I get nervous. I got this blood condition. Just help me inside, Jimmy, then I'll be all right.
You heard what I said, Dil?
My pills...
What pills?
Prescription. For my condition.
What condition?
My condition. Ennui.
Are you supposed to take that many?
Only in times of extreme stress.
See, they all say good-bye sometime. 'Cept for him.
Are you all right, Dil?
I will be.
Go on, then.
Good-bye, Dil
Jimmy?
What?
Don't go like that.
Can't help what I am.
Knew you had a heart...
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
You knew which man?
Your soldier.
You knew my Jody?
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
You knew my Jody?
Are you listening?
Yes.
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
Died...
Did you hear me?
You killed my Jody?
In a manner of speaking.
It was you...
You should scream. You should beat my head off.
You killed my Jody
No.
You didn't.
I suppose I tried.
You tried.
Don't you want to kill me?
Bang...
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
Okay.
What the fuck --
So tell me what you're doing, Jimmy.
Didn't really listen last night. I heard but I didn't listen.
That won't do you no good. Dil knows how to tie a body.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
He asked me to see were you all right.
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
Stop it, Dil --
Just don't kick Dil and she'll be touched. Be nice to her and she'll be yours forever.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
Let me go, Dil
Why?
Got to be somewhere.
Try and go, then.
Where the fuck is he? Christ --
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
Let them come then.
Can't stay here, Peter -- drive around once more --
Just want your company for a little while longer...
That fucker's dead --
No, we are.
You don't know what you're doing, Dil --
Never did...
Give me the shooter, Jude --
You're crazy --
Give me the fucking shooter!
You like me now, Jimmy?
I like you, Dil --
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
More what?
More endearments.
I like you, DIl
Love me.
Yes.
Tell me you love me.
Whatever you say, Dil.
Then say it.
Love you, Dil.
You do?
Yeah.
What would you do for me?
Anything.
Say it again.
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
And you'll never leave me?
Never.
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
I'm sorry, Dil.
You stupid shit -- Once was bad enough. But twice.
You didn't knock, honey --
Dil!
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
Fergus.
What's Fergus?
It's my name, Dil --
What happened to Jimmy?
I said get it off me, Fergus --
What's she going to do, Jimmy? She going to blow you away?
Was she there too? When you got my Jody?
Dil!!!
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
You sick bitch --
You was there, wasn't you? You used those tits and that ass to get him, didn't you?
She was there, wasn't she?
She was --
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Yes.
Tell me what she wore.
Can't remember...
Can't do it, Jimmy. He won't let me.
You won't let me, Jody --
You've got to go now, Dil --
Do I?
Yes. Now.
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
Not if you go.
Will I see you again?
You will, Dil
Promise?
I promise.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
The Metro.
Meet Col --
Yes. Say hello to Col --
You should have stayed at home.
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
Don't call me that --
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
Stop it, Dil --
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
Thirty-five.
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Fergus.
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life -
Please, Dil --
Can't help it. You're doing time for me. No greater love, as the man says. Wish you'd tell me why.
As the man said, it's in my nature.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, there was this scorpion, you see. And he wants to go across the river. But he can't swim. So he goes to this frog, who can swim, and he says to him, "Excuse me, Mr. Froggy..."
