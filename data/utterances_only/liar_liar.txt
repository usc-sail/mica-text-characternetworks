"Work." Today we're going to share what our parents do for work. QUICK CUTS of a series of five-year olds standing beside their desks, addressing the class:
My dad is a truck driver.
My mommy is a doctor.
My dad is a librarian and my mom is a vegetarian.
 My father is a struck-sher-al- engine-ear.
My mother is an actress. She works at Denny's.
My daddy works at a place where they make stuff, and my mommy is a mommy.
(looking a little
My father is a postal worker. The QUICK CUTS end with MAX:
My mom's a teacher. As Max starts to sit:
And your dad?
EMPTY_LINE
Well... he wears a suit and goes to court and talks to the judge and--
A dark street. . . a stormy night... two desperate men struggle... one man is taken to the hospital, the other to ja il. The prosecutor wants you to believe this is an open-and-shut case of a poor man, brutally victimized. He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.
Well, for once I agree with t he prosecutor. This is an open-and shut case -- but the true victim is my client. Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.
Put yourself in his shoes for a moment--walking home from church, alone, in a frightening part of the suburbs. As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM
You're nervous, timid, looking over your shoulder -- when suddenly, you encounter him-- (pointing at the old man) pouncing from the shadows. You quiver in fear. The streetlight flashes on something shiny in his hand-- a knife?
And in that terrifying instant you do what any respectable citizen would -- you defend y ou rse lf. Only after you shatter his arm and collarbone do you realize it's all a mistake... the man was merely walking away from an ATM machine, the apparent flash of metal caused by his bank card. He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.
And why? Why does the State turn its massive power against this individual? (takes an
moment, then answers his own
Discrimination, (to a black
But this time it's not based on race. (to a female
Not based on gender. (to a man wearing a crucifix) Not based on religion, (to a heavy set
No--this time it's discrimination based on size! . I know what the prosecution wants you to think - - i t ' s always the big guy's fault. Is that what we've come to as a society -- persecuting people because they're large? Fletcher points accusingly at the opposition.
Shame on you, Mister Prosecutor! Shame on you! (turning back to
The state is trying to barbeque my client on the spit of Justice. Only you can douse the flames. The decision is your s. And please...don't let your emotions run away with y ou . The fact that my client is a family man, raising his sons alone after the tragic death of their mother, has absolutely no bearing on this case. In the front row we see two sad-faced YOUNG CHILDREN.
Instead, let cold reason be your guide as you decide the fate of this church-going, orphan-rasing widower! Fletcher returns to his seat. Jurors, dab their eyes.
How's it going, Fletcher?
 Another gratifying day serving Justice. Fletcher's huge client catches up to him.
Hey great job, Mr. Reid. I wish there was some way I could show my appreciation.
Stay out of my neighborhood after dark. A PUBLICIST carrying, a clipboard approaches Fletcher.
Mr. Reid, do you have a moment-?
No, I'm late picking up my son.
-Because a couple of reporters want to interview you about your big win today. Fletcher instantly shifts directions.
How's my hair? And he's off to woo a GANG OF REPORTERS.
What time is it?
(checks her
I ' m sure he just got tied up in court again. Finally, Fletcher's BMW pulls up. Max races to him, delighted.
Dad!
Maximillian! (calls out a
Fletcher instantly becomes a human version of the TRANSFORMER TOY making ROBOTIC MOVEMENTS and SOUNDS. Max knows the routine well, moves in perfect sine with dad. . ... Until --                       .
Malfunction in vector 3 ! ! Malfunction in vector 3!! (pretends to lose control of a 'robotic' arm) Look out! It's on tickle mode!! Fletcher's "mechanical arm" becomes CLAW-LIKE, TICKLING MAX like crazy! Max loves it. Audrey watches these two kids, smiles.
 And who is this lovely lady? Max, could you introduce me?
That's no lady, that's mom!
Thanks, Max.
Mom? ! (under his
Himnm. . . I don't remember her looking that good, (becomes the robot again) Malfunction in Vector 4! Malfunction in Vector 4! Fletcher's other robotic arm becomes a "pincher", comes after Audrey.
You know, you were much easier when we were married...  So where are you off too?
Stanford. I'm delivering a paper.
O h really? Where I live, we use a boy on a bike.
Hey mom, dad's taking me to see wrestling!
Oh, Fletcher!
mimicking her) Oh, Audrey!
Do you have to take him to tho se things? They're so violent.
The boy must learn the way of the war rior . An d wh o be tter to teach him than Rowdy Rod- . Piper and Big John Stud? Audrey can't help but LAUGH.
He must be schooled in the way of the face-claw, the sleeper- hold, and the purple nuxple. For only then--
 The squaw will never understand us. A HORN HONKS. It's the good-natured, affable JERRY. Max runs up to him.
Max, my man! Jerry gives Max "five", then kisses Audrey on the lips.
Fletcher, good to see you?
What? No kiss for me?
 What do you say, Max? Give me a hand? Fletcher grits his teeth as Jerry gives Max a piggyback ride to get the luggage.
 I didn't know the boyfriend was going.
Jerry. His name is Jerry and yes, he's going. Audrey heads inside.
T o Stanford? Overnight? Does this mean you two are... (cringes, can't say the words)
I've been seeing him seven months, what do you think?
I was hoping that after being married to me, you'd have no more strength left.
. Well you have to remember when we were married, I wasn't having sex nearly as often as you were.
MEDIC!! I've been hit.
Well, great... I'm so happy for you two. I am just Mister H appy man. Happy, happy, happy.
Relax, Fletcher. It looks like Jerry's taking that job offer in Boston. Fletcher turns sincere.
Aud, I am so sorry...
(calling to
Ready? Audrey and Jerry say goodbye to Max.    They get in his Explorer.
 Yo u gonna be okay? Because if not, we could leave Max with your sister and I could go out with you two, does that appeal to you at all? They drive off.
Wave to the soon-to-be ex- boyfriend, Max. (flipping Max the
You drive.
Dad, are we really going to go to wrestling?
Absolutely, Maxattacker. We just have to stop by the office for one minute. Max SIGHS. He's heard this before.
As they head inside, Fletcher and Max pass a BEGGAR.
'Scuse me, sir. Do you have any change?
(patting his
'Fraid not. Sorry.
Fletcher!
Philip!
And this must be Max!
 . Yes. Yes it is. Well, it was good seeing you-- Fletcher starts off with Max, when Philip calls after him.
You know, Ethel and I had a blast at our last little get- together.
Oh, me too. I can never get enough of charades. We'll have to do it again sometime. Fletcher heads into an open elevator... only to find the door's closing impededby Philip's foot.
When?
Soon. The door again begins to close... when Philip stops it.
How 'bout tonight?
Not that soon. I'm taking Max to see wrestling--
We love wrestling.     We could--
I don't think so. See, Max is really shy around strangers. Max looks up at Fletcher.    He isn't.
Tell you what -- give me your card as a reminder. I'll call y o u . Soon. Promise.
Great! Philip hands him his card just as the door closes.
Hi, Mr. Reid. (indicates, her
What do you think?
Fabulous! I love it. (indicates the
What's this?
I don't know who sent it. But it's for Mr. Allan. It's his anniversary.
Ah... The Partnership Committee meeting still scheduled for Friday?
 Yep... Fletcher quickly removes a gift card from his pocket, scribbles on it, puts it in place of the one already there
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm... fixing the card, (shows him the old card) Look, they spelled Mr. Allan's name wrong. Have an apple.
I can't do it.
Fred, it's your duty to present the strongest case possible.
The strongest case possible, consistent with the truth.
Let the Judge decide what's true. That's what he gets paid for. You get paid to win.
If you insist on my taking it to trial, I'll represent Mrs. Cole aggressively and ethically. But, Miranda -- I won't lie. Miranda looks out her window, calculating.
Then we'll just have to find someone who'will.
Hey, Pete! Great tie!        . Max looks at PETE, -whose fashion-disaster tie startles him.
Thomas--looks like you're losin' weight. THOMAS glances up from a file. Max notes that he's corpulent.
Gained three pounds.
(wedging past
On you, it works.
M ax ! What's new?
Well. . . it's my birthday tomo rrow. We're having a party and everything. Flet cher's EYES WIDEN. He has clearly forgotten.
I'm sure your dad'11 give you something wonderful. Fletcher tries to wave her off, awkwardly stopping when Max turns to him.     .
Yeah?
Oh, yeah. You're going to love it. Uh, why don't you play in my office for a minute? Fax something, sue someone, have a good time. We'll be leaving in a second.
Damn!   I completely forgot.
Oh, there's a surprise. Greta produces a wrapped GIFT.
You're a saint. I should get you something.
You did. She holds up another, smaller package.
Ah. Well, I always do the classy thing. Any calls?
. Let's see.. .
Judge Patterson's clerk. He needs your filing.
Tell him it's in the mail.
(jotting down a
Right. You'll do it next week. Mr. McKinley phoned, questioning that fourteen hours you billed on Christinas Eve.
Write him a long, explanatory letter. Then bill him for the letter.
.    .. Done. Your mother called.
I ' m on vacation.
This is your fifth week.      .      .
It's a long vacation.
(jotting down a
"Break mother's heart." Done. And that's it, except Miranda's looking for you.
 As if I don't have anything better to do than bow and scrape at her royal perfumed p artner feet. Tell her I'm in court.
Court's closed.
Tell her I broke my leg and had to be shot.
--And then send out a notice of judgement on my win today!
Miranda! I didn't see you. Hey, you look lovely, today. Here, I bought you a gift.
Thanks. I heard about your victory today. You're making quite an impression on the partnership committee.
Oh, that's right. You folks are meeting again soon. "Allan, Stewart, Konigsberg, and Ried." There's something about the rhythm of fours. It's like a full measure. Well, anyway, I've got a client waiting in my office--
Actually, something important h as come up. You're not busy tonight, are you? Before Fletcher answers, we:
We're not going, are we?
Of course we are. A promise i s a promise. We are gonna see wrestling or my name isn't Fletcher T. Reid.
 Could you hand me that? (the wrestler
Thank you. (without looking
We are having some fun, eh Maxer? PUSH IN on Max; he isn't.
Are you alright?
Uh, yeah, just, uh... how long are you gonna be on the phone?
I just wanted to say good- night to Max, but he must still be out with Fletcher, 
Uh...would I . . . ? What did you say?
Max Factor... Happy birthday. How old are you today? T h ir t y ? Forty?
Five.
Well, you've held up well. I only wish there was some way to commemorate such an occasion, some small symbol to mark this day, like.... Fletcher produces --
. . . A present! .
What is it?
 It's... it's.  a surprise. Max knows his father doesn't have a clue but he rips the box open, revealing, a BASEBALL, GLOVE, DODGER'S CAP, and
Baseball stuff!
Baseball stuff.
 Will you play catch with me?
Max beams.
Tonight. After your party, you have my word on it. Max nods sadly as Fletcher turns back to his work.
 Jerry, these are for tomorrow.
The company wants me to get started right away.
I can't just pick up and move to Boston with two days notice.
Ju st come check it out. You a nd Max, see the town. Let's . pick out a place together. Then, if you want to turn me down and scar me for life, fine.
It's just not that simple... What about my job? I've been at UCLA three years.
It's New England. They're lousy with colleges. You can't swing a bat back there without hitting a college.
There are other factors involved.
Did you have fun? How were the wrestling matches?
Big fun. Manly fun. Am I right, Maxie?
 So how were the wrestling matches ? Did you have fun?
Max , my man! My happy birthday man! Max and Jerry exchange "fives" and'a hug.   Jerry gives Max a light punch on the arm.
One-two-three-four-five... and one for good luck.
Did you see that? He struck the child!
Look what dad got me! 
Whoa! Great! I have my glove in the car. We'll stop in the park on the way home and play c atch. Then tonight we'll oil
 When is it his birthday?
Some thing's come up. We need to talk.
Mom, let's go. I want to play.
 We'll talk tonight.
Tonight?
Max's birthday?
Oh , yeah, right. Seven. I knew that. I did. I blocked it out weeks ago. The se ven tee nt h of May. Max's birthday.
It's the eighteenth.
The seventeenth of May is the day I .remind myself that the eighteenth is Max's birthday. See you tonight. They drive away.
This is good. This is really smart.
Thank you.
Only i t ' s . . . Like not true. Every word of it is a lie. Fletcher and Miranda exchange glances.
I mean... isn't that a problem?
Mrs. Cole, the only problem here is that after you've provided years of faithful service and loving support, of raising his children -- They are his?
H m ? Oh yeah. One for sure.
After all that, your husband wants to deny you a fair share of the marital assets based on one single act of
Seven.
Hm?
Seven single acts of indiscretion.
--Seven acts of indiscretion, only one of which he has any evidence of, and all of which he himself is responsible, for.
He is?
Mrs. Cole, I stayed up all night last night studying your c ase. Not just your case... b ut you. And, by now, I feel I know you. You are the victim here. The wife of a cold, distant businessman. Starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man--
Seven.
(not missing a
--Seven .other men. You're not trying to deny him what is r ig htf ull y his. All you're insisting on is what is r ig htf ull y yours. And maybe an idgy-smidgy bit more. I think you're bending over backwards.
Well, I did agree to give him j oint custody of the kids...  He's always been a good father.
And you've always been a good wife.
(getting worked
Yeah. . .
There's such a thing as being t oo nice. That's why you need aggr essive representation. To show the court that there is more than one side to this st ory. All I'm asking is the opportunity to see that justice is done on your behalf.  Will you give me that opportunity?
Yes! I ' m tired of getting kicked around.
Good for you!
Thank you, Mr. Reid. I ' m so grateful I have an attorney I can trust. S he gives him a HUG and momentarily grabs his ass. With a farewell nod to Miranda, she leaves. Miranda turns, smiles at Fletcher, then shuts the door. She moves in on him.
You're good. You're really good.
Oh, pshaw. (pronounces it with the "p") She picks a piece of lint off.his jacket.
N o, I mean it. The Cole case is worth a truckload of money to this firm, not to mention the press it's going to g en er at e . You win this case and I guarantee you'll make partner.

Excuse me? She grabs his lapels and pulls him in for a deep KISS.
(indicating the
What do you think?
Well, if you don't hire your brother, who will?
They called me again from B oston. They really want me there tomorrow.
. . . I can't go to Boston.
How come?
Max.
He'll love it there.
It's Fletcher.
Fletcher?
I can't move Max three thousand miles away from his father.
Audrey, I have never said a bad word about your ex --
I know.
But how much responsibility does Fletcher take for Max, now? He'd never come over if you didn't remind him.
I know. But if they're three thousand miles apart they'll never see each other. Fletcher will never come to Boston and how can I send Max cross-country to him?
So because your ex-husband is unreliable, we can't-'-
I know, it's not logical, it's emotional. I'm sorry. Pause.
I still want to marry you.
Are you sure? Jerry picks up the PHONE, pulls out a piece of paper, dials.
 Mr. Crisitelli, Jerry She!ton... I hope I'm not calling too late... Mr. Crisitelli, I'm afraid I have to turn down your offer..'. So am I . . . Well, I've fallen in love with this beautiful woman in L.A. and she doesn't want to leave and I won't leave without her... Well, thank you very much... Yes, good-bye.
Hello...
Fletcher, where are you? We're getting ready to cut the cake.
Urn, actually, something has come up. A problem on a new caaa--                . Miranda bites one of Fletcher's nipples.
What happened?
Nothing. I just nailed my knee into the desk... Listen, I'm really sorry I can't 'make it.
Max is going to be so disappointed.
I'll make it up to him, I promise. I'll pick him up from school tomorrow, okay?
Do you want me to put him on the phone? Miranda starts "reeling in" the phone cord.
Ah, no.     I have to go.
Right. ANGRILY, she hangs up. Fletcher stares UNHAPPILY at the phone, before Miranda THROWS HIM BACK ONTO THE COUCH.
All right, birthday boy, make a wish. Max doesn't respond.
C'mon, honey. It can be anything-- whatever you want most in the world. When he .doesn't respond, she leans down to him..
Max, your dad is sorry. He had to work.
He said he was coming. He promised.
Yes, well, he... promises he'll see you tomorrow. Max doesn't believe it.     < He turns his full attention to the candles on the cake.   In VOICE OVER we hear what she does not.
I wish, for just one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie. He takes a breath --and blows out all the candles. A strange WIND blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up, up, up... to the clock on the wall. It's 9:15.
A clock on a wall.   It's 9:15'. We are--
S o . . . was it good for you? Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing way possible-- he TELLS THE TRUTH.
I've had better. Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing compared to the LOOK OF SHOCK on Fletcher's face.
The door SLAMS SHUT again, leaving him without his pants. A CLEANING LADY stares at him in shock, then takes her broom, aims for his crotch, SWINGS.and. . .
"I've had better?"
"I've had better?!"
 "I've had better?" I t arrives. He steps in.
New in the building?
I just moved in Monday.
Ah. Well, you must allow me to give you the grand tour.
O h? Do you do that for all the new tenants?
No. Just the ones I want to bang like a drum. Fletcher's face REGISTERS extreme SHOCK and...
Any change, Mister?
Absolutely. But he continues walking.
Could you spare some?
Unquestionably. Fletcher walks faster, PUZZLED that he has answered truthfully. The beggar is even more puzzled.
Will you?
No.
How come?
Because I resent your p re sen ce. You fill me with an unpleasant mixture of disgust and guilt. Further, I don't believe you'll use the money for food, but I believe you'll use it for, at worst, drugs, or, at best, whiskey, or . cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap. As Fletcher heads up the stairs...
Jerkoff.
You look like you're having a rough morning.
I've had better. He WINCES as he recognizes the words. Then, an extremely wealthy, respectable industrialist, RICHARD COLE enters with his attorney, DANA APPLETON, young, brisk, confident.
Good morning, Fletcher.
Dana.         "
All right, Virginia, how much will it take to put an end to this?
Fifty per cent of your estate. Richard is SHOCKED.
Fifty per cent? With a pre- nup and proof of adultery? What's your case?
Our case is simply this. . . Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he CAN'T GET THE WORDS OUT. He tries to FORCE OUT SOUNDS, but succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land.
Interesting, though based on your track record, I expected a little more. Nearing panic, Fletcher whirls to his BRIEFCASE and grabs the brief.
Wa it! Wait!    I've got it in writing! But when Dana tries to take the document, the astonished Fletcher finds himself PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO RELEASE IT.
Let go!
I'm trying!
All rise for the Honorable Judge William Stevens.
Very funny, Fletcher. You want to play hardball, I'm game. JUDGE STEVENS takes the bench.
Calling case BA 09395, Richard Cole versus Virginia Cole. How're we doing this morning, counsel?
Fine, thank you.
And you, Mr. Reid?
Well, I'm a little upset about a bad sexual episode I had last night-- Fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what he just said. After an awkward silence--
Yes, Your Honor.
I take it you're seeking to substitute in as counsel?
Yes, Your Honor.
Fine , fine. And for the record, the reason is?
Mr. Rand had severe ethical objections to my client's case. Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.
I take it you don't share the same ethical objections, Mr. Reid?
I have lower standards, Your Honor.
I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole wants the substitution of counsel, I'll allow it. Is that what you want, Mrs. Cole? Virginia looks to the judge, then to Fletcher, whose unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier.
Fine.
(aside, to
What are you doing?
Your Honor, I ' d like a continuance!
I realize that, Your Honor, but I ' d really, really, really like a continuance.
I'll have to hear good cause, counselor. What's the problem?
I can't lie!
Motion for a continuance denied. Is there any chance of a settlement in this case?
I don't think so, Your Honor. Mr. Reid made it abundantly clear that the last thing in the world he wanted was to --
There appears to have been a change in strategy. Let's go to my chambers and negotiate. He BANGS the gavel.
Your Honor, under the terms of the prenuptual agreement, if Mrs. Cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing. We have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not her husband.
Sounds pretty damning, Mr. Reid.
It certainly does.
However, my client has no desire to see his ex-wife destitute. Against my advice, he's willing to offer her a cash settlement of.two point four million dollars.
Two four seems like a pretty fair offer, Mr. Reid.
Fantastically fair. Phenominally fair. In fact, I'd say beyond fair, bordering on stupid. Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness refreshing.
What are you suggesting, Mr. Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack of faith in her position?
 No, not at all. She's got my client dead to rights. When
Can the sarcasm, Reid. All right, I admit it -- I've seen you make even the lamest case fly. But this time I have you. Even Clarence Darrow couldn't explain this away. She brandishes the audiotape.
Wel l, Mr. Reid? without a dynamite explanation, I'd say you're dead in the water. How's you client's story?
The best that money can buy, Y o u r Honor.
Strong corroborating evidence?
We have evidence that you are not going to-believe. Despite herself, Dana is beginning to look worried.
You're pretty confident how this trial is going to come out, eh, Mr. Reid?
. "Confident" is too weak a word, Your Honor. I am certain what will happen if I take this puppy to trial. The verdict will be a stunning, humiliating defeat that will cut a spectacularly promising legal career off at the knees. Fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but Dana thinks he's speaking about her. She buckles.
All right! Double the offer! Four point eight! And not a penny more. (venomous, to
Bastard! She storms out, leaving an astounded Fletcher behind.
You are some negotiator, Mr. Reid. If your client has half a brain, she'll jump at the offer.
No!
No? ! Mrs. Cole, this offer was a miracle. I'm talking about a walking-on-water, Lazarus-rising-from-the-dead,
DMV miracle! You've gone from two point four to four point eight million in... (checks his
four minutes. Think of it this way -- now you're getting paid seven hundred thou per schtupp!
Mr. Reid, you convinced me yesterday -- I'm the victim here, starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man--
Seven!
-- Seven other men. With the story you came up with, I don't think I can lose. I want to proceed.
Mrs. Cole, you don't        . understand, I-- But before Fletcher can finish, the judge enters.
Well , Mr. Reid. Do we have a settlement? Fletcher looks pleadingly at his client, but she is firm. He shakes his head unhappily. The judge is irritated.
Th ere' s no settlement. Trial to start at one-thirty sharp. He BANGS the gavel. Fletcher emits an involuntary whimper.
What do you think?
I think you need help. HORRIFI ED, Fletcher hurries on. The heavyset Thomas ambulates in his way.                           -
What's shakin', Fletcher?
Your cellulite, Tubster. The now panicked Fletcher breaks into a run, passing Fred.
Hiy a, Fletcher. How's the Cole case going?
 'Straight into the crapper, you wuss, with my career right behind it.
Hi, boss. What's happening
Red.   Red. All right. Focus, (with great

His feet KICK OVER OBJECTS on the shelves'behind him. He finally forces pen to paper. He looks down where he wrote
"This pen is blue."
Boss, what's wrong?
. The pen is blue!! The pen is     . b l u e ! ! The GODDAMN PEN IS
Almost weeping, he collapses into a chair. A moment -- then Greta tentatively offers him a red pen.
Red?
Are you all right?
 I have to go home.
Home? Was the case settled?
No. I have to be in court at one-thirty.
Well, then how can you.go home?
I don't know, I don't know!!!
Okay. (walking on
Before I forget -- Rubin and Dun n called. They want to know where the Darvis settlement offer stands.
I only proposed a settlement t o dick with them. I never had any intention of going th ro ug h with it.  . Not certain why her boss would .shoot himself in the foot, Greta nonetheless jots down his remarks.
'...dick with them." Okay. Your accountant, Philip, called to remind you about getting together. .
I'd rather shave my ass and sit in vinegar..
(jotting down a
Got it. And your mother called again. Are you still on vacation?
nodding "yes") No.
So then you're here?
shaking his head
Yes.
I ' m having a little trouble following you. what do I say to your mom?
Thanks for clearing that up. And that's it, except your ex called and asked when you were cowing over to see your son.
Hey, Fletcher. T was wondering if you were going to still pick up Max after school today.
I don't think I can. I had a case I was certain would settle and it didn't. I have to go to trial this afternoon, God help me.
(not believing
Right.
It's true... I really do want to see Max, today. Fletcher considers what he just said, realizes it is true.
How about that. I really do.
Yes, but-this time it's different.
I see. And how is that?
( he walked into
This time I'm telling the truth.
But last night you weren't?
No.
What were you doing?
Having sex.
, It must have been with someone very "special."
No. It was with someone I don't even like. But I thought it would help my career and at the moment that
Is dad picking me up?
No, I'm sorry, Max. He can't make it. I will. I'll work it out. Max is disappointed.
I guess my wish didn't come true.
What wish?
I wished that, for just one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie. Max heads toward his teacher. Audrey is deeply moved.
Answer, answer, answer...
Hello.
Audrey, let me explain. Something has happened to me--
Fletcher, something else is about to happen to you.
What do you mean?
Max and I are moving to Boston.
What?!
Jerry asked me to marry him. He wants Max and I to fly with him this weekend to pick out a house. And I'm going to go. God knows I don't have any reason to stay here.
. Wait, you can't move! If you take Max away... I'll practically never see him.
Well then you'll have pretty much the same relationship you have with him now.
Audrey, please.... Is this because of what I just said on the phone?
That was the straw and this is the camel's back saying goodbye.
Where are you?
Heading home.
When you gee there, stay there. I'll be right over. We have to talk.
I'll be right- there!
Aaaah!
Flet cher. Fletcher, Fletcher, Fletcher. I must confess-- after last night's incident, I was. . . hurt. So hurt. I was tempted to do whatever little things lie in my power to scuttle your chances of making partner. Fletcher is FRIGHTENED.
But then I thought, "No, that 's not fair. Fletcher didn't mean to insult me."
his tie) "It was just some massive, boneheaded misunderstanding, and Fletcher is very, very sorry." Fletcher smiles.   It looks like he's off the hook, until--
Isn't that right, Fletcher?
 Uh -- not really, no.
 N o ? No?! What are you sayi ng? Have you no respect for me?!
None, whatsoever. I mean, I ' d like to respect you, and if it weren't for your mistreatment of the associates, your rudeness to the staff, and the fact that your work sucks, I would.
But -- what about last night?
I was afraid you wouldn't support my partnership if I turned you down. Plus, I have an immature need for sexual conquests.
Gotta focus. . . gotta focus. He's so preoccupied that he speeds through a crosswalk and almost hits an OLD MAN.
The color of the pen is -- re d !      . But he hasn't regained the ability to lie -- he's referring to the RED LIGHT he just ran, nearly colliding with a truck. The DRIVER screams:
What's your problem, schmuck?!
 I ' m an inconsiderate prick!
C'mon, you can do this! The color of the pen is -- RED! This time he's referring to the flashing red light of a POLICE CAR in his rearview mirror.
S hi t !!
Do you know why I stopped you?
Depends on how long you were following me.
Why don't we take it from the top.
 Here goes -- I didn't fasten my seatbelt, I didn't glance in my rearview mirror, I didn't signal when I pulled away from the curb, I sped, I followed too closely, I ran a stop sign, I almost hit :a Chevy Camaro, I almost hit a ge ezer, I sped some more, I failed to yield at a crosswalk, I changed lanes in the intersection, I changed lanes without signalling, and I changed lanes in the
signalling while running a red light and speeding. A long moment.
May I see your driver's license?
No.
And why is that?
It's in my other pants.
I see. And where are your other pants?
Hanging from my boss's credenza.
Do you expect me to believe that?
No.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
Yes -- but that's beside the point! My license actually is in my other pants, and they actually were hanging from a credenzaJ I wouldn't lie to you! I mean, I would if I could, but I can't!
I see. So you ..have no reason to try and hide your license from me?
I didn't say that. I have other reasons. Seventeen reasons, to be precise. (begrudgingly, off the officer's look) Unpaid parking tickets.
Audrey, wait!
Wait? You know, I just had an insight into myself. I ' m crazy. You call me up and . tell me to wait here because you'll be right over and -- here's the crazy part -- I actually wait.
I can explain--
I missed a department meeting. I. . . Did you come in a cab?
Yes.
Where's your car?
Thank you. . I can't tell you how much this means to me.
I can. One thousand, six hundred, and fifty-four dollars and eleven cents.
Ow.
You scratched my car!
Where?     .
Right there!
Oh that? That was already there.
What?
(angrier and
...Nothing! Because if I take you to small-claims court, it will just drain eight hours out of my life, and you probably won't show up, and if I finally got the judgment you'd just stiff me anyway, so what I'm gonna do is piss and moan like an impotent jerk and . then bend over and take it up the tail pipe!
You've been here before, haven't you? He flips Fletcher the keys and goes.
Well I can't remember when I've had more fun, now if you'll excuse me, I have a class. She starts out.
Audrey, wait. I want to talk to you about this Boston situation.
What do you want to say?
You can't go. It's not fair. Taking Max three thousand miles away is not fair.
Let' s define "fair." Last night a five-year old boy was crushed because his father lied to him about coming to his birthday party. Fair?
Last night--
-- Was none of my business. When it happened two years ago it was my business, but now I don't have to care anymore. See, that's the magic of div orce . But it does matter to Max. Everything you do matters to him... and everything you don't do.
All right-- now let me tell you something...you're absolutely right. I'm guilty of all charges. I'm throwing myself on the mercy of your -court. Audrey doesn't know what to say. Fletcher seems very sincere, but she can't trust him.
I have an idea. I'll come over tonight, right after court lets out and play with M ax. Have him invite some fri ends over. We'll have a game and everything. Then, you and I can sit down and talk.
We're suppose to be on a plane
No, Audrey. Just talk to me abou t this first. Please. Au drey, I've lost you. Don't make me lose Max, too.
You're really coming?
This is iron-clad. This is the mother of all promises. What time?
...Six?
Ten-to-six.
I will be there.
I hope so. Do you know what your son was doing at nine- fif teen las t ni ght? He was making a wish on his birthday c ake. He was wishing that, for just one day, his dad couldn't tell a lie. She drives away. Fletcher starts for his car, pensive, when a new thought strikes him.
Oh my God! That-'s it! An innocent kid - - a heartfelt plea-- a birthday wish! Sure, it' s impossible --but it 'makes sense!..! If he can wish it, he can unwish it!
Dad!
Hi. Listen, I need to talk to
Mr. Reid, we were just talking ab ou t careers. You're a lawyer, aren't you?
Mr. Reid it'would be wonderful for the children to hear something positive about lawyers!
Well, actually--
Children! .Mr. Reid is going to tell us what it's like to be a lawyer. She leads the kids in APPLAUSE. Fletcher takes center s tage. The children stare, rapt with attenion.
Uh, hi. Uh, I'm a lawyer and I work at a big law firm with a lot of other lawyers and I do stuff in a law court. Thank you. He starts out.
One moment, Mr. Reid. Maybe some of the children have
 Jeffrey?
What kind of lawyer are you?
Mostly, I ' m a divorce lawyer.
What's that?
It means if you're daddy left your mommy, he'd call me.
So what do you do?
 I help people fight over their money and their children.
Can't they fight without you?
Why would my daddy leave my mommy?
To marry a younger woman. To escape a loveless marriage and have cheap meaningless sex. To cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs, flat feet, spare tires, gum disease, hair loss, liver spots, kidney stones, clogged arteries, diabetes, goiter and eventual death. The kids EYES GO WIDE. A moment, then:
Monster-Max.
Dadzilla. You came to play catch?
No. I ' d like to, but I can't right now. Max is disappointed again.
I ' m sorry I missed your party la st night. How was your Uncle Glen?
Stupid. His big nose and stupid orange hair...
That's why he should have worn make-up. Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh. Max doesn't laugh.
Yeah, okay, urn... Your mother told me about... the wish you made last night. It came true. Max is amazed.
Really? You mean you have to tell the truth?
Yes.
No matter what?
No matter what.
Is wrestling real?
In the Olympics, yes.      On    . Channel 23, no.
Will sitting close to the TV set make me go blind?
Not in a million years.
If I keep making this face-- (makes a horrible
will it get stuck that way?
Uh-uh.
.If I go in the water right after lunch, will I drown?
Only if you can't 'swim.
Why do I have to eat squash?
Because your mom buys it.
How come you're always too busy to play with me? The sudden shift in tone startles Fletcher. He feels awful.
I . . . I don't know. I ' m . . . Hey, you know I'm coming over to nig ht. We're gonna play together.
Baseball?
. Yes! This is absolutely an A-number one promise. You and I -- tonight -- baseball. Fletcher and Max do their ritual "five" slap.
Now, listen, Max, I need a favor from you. I ' m in a little trouble today. I need you to take that wish back.
So you can lie?
Not to you.
To who?
Max, sometimes grownups... need to lie. It's hard to explain, but i f . . . Look, here's an example. When Mommy was pregnant with you, she gained a little weight. Se venty pounds. I thought she was gonna give birth to a car. But she'd say to me "How do I lo ok?" So I'd say, "Oh, honey, you're beautiful, you're glowing.11 Otherwise, I would've hurt Mommy's fee ling s. Understand? Max nods.
You didn't think she was beautiful.
Right. No... Max, I don't know how to get along in the grown-up world if I have to stick to the truth. I could lose my case, I could lose my promotion, I could even lose, my job... Do you understand? Max shakes his head "no."
Will you help me anyway? A moment -- then Max reluctantly nods.
That's my boy! Fletcher opens the box, revealing a cake and candles.... He takes out two birthday hats. He puts one on Max and one on himself.
Now, do whatever you did last night... only this time, make an un-wish. Not really happy, Max turns to the candles on the cake. He takes a breath-- and blows them out.
I did it. ^
Great! Great! Now to test --
Fletcher returns to his son.
Did it work?
Not like I ' d hoped. Did you really unwish it? Max nods.
Only...
Only what?
Yesterday, when I wished it, I r ea lly meant it. This time when I unwished it I only did it 'cause you told me to.
 Well, then do it again.        Only this time, mean it.
I can't.
Why not?!
Because I don't want you to lie.
I explained this to you! I have to lie. Everybody lies! Mommy lies, even the wonderful Jerry lies--
But you're the only one who makes me feel bad.
I have to go.
I am coming over, tonight, Max. You believe me, don't you? Max hesitates, then nods.
I'll see you tonight, buddy... That's a promise. Max heads back to class. Fletcher picks up the cake, looks at it, then dumps it in a trash barrel.
Yo, Fletcher! How's it hanging?
Short and shrivelled. Fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots Philip. He shields his face with his briefcase. Philip recognizes him anyway.
Fletcher! I'm still waiting for your call. I guess you must've lost my card --
No --
Or my phone was busy --
No --
Or you just forgot --
No --
(cannot be
Or something. So anyway,' why don't you swing by my place around seven-thirty! Philip starts off, when Fletcher calls after him resolutely.
Philip... I don't want to come over to your house! A long moment, then --
Fi n e ! We'll go out! There's this new karaoke bar I've been dying to try. I'll pick you up at your office! Seven- thirty! ! And he runs off.   Frustrated, Fletcher hurries on.
Do you want your messages?
No. He goes into his office. Greta is concerned.   She follows him in, leaving his door open.
Are you okay?
My son hates me.
No! He loves you. I've seen y ou together. You're his hero.
O h yeah? Last night at his birthday party, he made a wish. That I wouldn't be able to tell a lie for one whole day.
Kids...
It came true.
What?
It's true. Didn't it seem odd to you that I kept telling the truth all morning?
Well, yeah, but...
That's right!     I am incapable of lying.
Just today?
Apparently until 9:15 tonight. It's a twenty-four hour curse.
Yes, those are going around.
You don't believe me.
Of course not.
Go ahead. Ask me something I ' d normally lie about. She thinks.
A ll right. Remember a few months ago, I wanted a raise--
-- and the firm wouldn't.give me one. And I asked you if you would give it to me out of your own pocket and you said the company wouldn't permit it because it creates jealousy among the other secretaries? Was that true or did you just not want to pony up the dough?
Greta, please...  Yes Judge Stevens, hi!.. Fletcher Reid. I ' m scheduled to be in your court in half- an-hour... Judge Stevens, I badly, badly need a continuance. . . so I can go home and stay there the rest of the day...111? Am I ill? He wants to say "yes", but he can't.

Here's your raise.

 But if you could just do this for me, I-- The phone won't stop ringing.       .'

Hello... Mom!! The phone flies into the air. He catches it.
Mom... Well, I wasn't actually on vacation... Because I didn't want to talk to you... Because you insist on talking to me about Dad's bowel movements -- size, color, frequency... I'll call you later... No, not really. He pushes -two more buttons. Then SCREAMS.
Oh dammit! I cut him off! I cut off the Judge! Greta... He falls to his knees.
I'm on my knees in a nine hundred dollar suit. Don't leave. Greta stops.     She seems to consider.
A few years ago a friend of mine had a burglar up on her roof.

Have a nice day in court, bubbie. She leaves.   Fletcher starts to give chase...
He runs directly into Miranda.
Aaaah! Miranda smiles like a cat that's trapped a mouse.
Ah, Fletcher, so nice to bump i nto you. Are you busy?
Extremely.
Good. Would you follow me, please? Highly nervous, Fletcher follows Miranda down the hall.
Fletcher, did you know that the partnership committee is being headed up by Mr. Allan himself? (off his wary
Say, you used to work directly for Mr. Allan, didn't you? (off his waried
Tell me, what do you think of him?
Pardon me for interrupting your, meeting. Mr. Allan, you remember Fletcher Reid.
It's good to see you again, Fletcher. '. An involuntary WHIMPER from Fletcher.
Oh, that's right. You used to work together. .Tell me, what do you think of Mr. Allah? Fl etc he r gulps. This is it. His career is history. He's trying to hold it back, but--
I said... What do you think of Mr. Allan?
He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung. DE AN SILENCE. Then --Mr. Allan bursts into raucous LAUGHTER. He is joined by everyone except Miranda, who looks on, STUNNED. Everyone pounds the table in hysterics.
Marvelous! Marvelous! That's what I love most about this firm-- the collegial atmosphere, the hearty good- fellowship! Miranda is incensed.
And thanks for those flowers for my anniversary. My wife loved them.
Well, I'm due in court... bye- bye.
All rise. They do. Judge Stevens enters. He sits. Everyone sits.
Counselors, are we ready to begin?
(eagerly and a little too
N o sir! We are not ready to b eg in. My client has not arrived. The doors OPEN and Virginia Cole enters with her CHILDREN and a NANNY.

Try to relax! Breathe deeply! Falk hurries out with a cup, hands it to Fletcher, who downs it in one gulp -- then spews it out again, SCREAMING in PAIN. -
W hat?!   What?!
I couldn't find any water, so I got him coffee! Fletcher runs up and down the steps, frantically fanning h is scalded mouth. The bailiff appears.
Judge is taking the bench. Fletcher's expression turns to terror.
You may proceed, Mr. Reid. . Everyone turns to Fletcher in anticipation.    In a voice quaking with fear...
Sorry. One of the kids threw up in the car. Virginia takes her seat, leaving her two young children sitting dejectedly in the gallery with their nanny.
You brought your kids. . . to your divorce?

Sympathy.
Well, it's working. I feel sorry for them already. The judge BANGS the gavel.
Ms. Appleton, you may begin.
Dana Appleton questions BRYSON, a private investigator. Fletcher watches with mounting anxiety, NERVOUSLY DRINKS from a GLASS OF WATER at his table.

-- From March six through June twelve, I surveilled Mrs. Cole at the behest of Mr. Cole. During that period, I noted that Mr. Cole left each day between seven-forty and seven- fifty. Thereafter, Mrs. Cole would frequently have a male visitor arrive and stay for one to four hours. I was able to take several photographs of the male visitor. He shows a photo - - o f a strapping hunk. Fletcher TAKES A

Well, they were pretty good about keeping the shades drawn -- but I sure was able to hear. I made an audiotape of one such., "session." H e hands her the tape. Fletcher refills his glass.
With the Court's permission, I would like to play the tape.
Your Honor, I object!
And why is that, Mr. Reid?
(can't help
Because it's devastating to my case. The judge is startled by his candor.
Overruled.. As Dana pops the tape into a player, Fletcher anxiously
So , what did you say? You ready?
Oh boy am I ready.
Good. Let me help you off with that. Come on, lie down.
Wai t a minute. Do you have protection?
Right here. Okay, now I ' m gonna show you something new.
Oh, I've never done it like this before.                    ..
Don't worry, you can take it. Oh yeah. That's it. There you go. Yes! Yes! WE HEAR labored rhythmic breathing.
Yes, yes, yes -- As Dana fast-forwards again, then resumes... with still more labored breathing, building intensity and --
Oh yeah, bring it on .home -- yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! YES! YES! The groans reach their incredible climax. There's a still moment. . . As the shy COURT REPORTER, the macho BAILIFFS and the no- nonsense judge all mop their brows, Dana shuts off the tape. She turns to Fletcher with a satisfied smile.
Your witness.
No questions.
No questions? .
No questions?
(afraid to ask
No questions.
All right, Mr. Reid. You may proceed.
 How?! Gathering his courage, he stands, downs the last of his water, and moves to the lecturn. He's about to speak... when a WONDERFUL FEELING sweeps through him. After a momement, he grins.
Would the Court be willing to grant me a short bathroom break?
It can't wait?
Not unless you want to mop up.
What did I think? That I could piss for forty-five minutes?! He HITS HIS FOREHEAD in frustration... and gets an idea. He HITS HIMSELF AGAIN and AGAIN, SMASHES HIS HEAD INTO THE WALL, POKES HIMSELF IN THE EYES, YANKS ON HIS EARS, finally KNOCKS HIMSELF IN THE STALL, where he continues his attack. A MAN enters, hears a commotion from behind the stall door.
What's going on in-there?
I ' m abusing myself! Do you mind?! The man looks disgusted. He carefully leaves the room.
I found him like this in the bathroom. Somebody beat the hell out of him.
Who did this?
-What did he look like?
About five eleven, hundred eighty-five pounds, crazed look in his eye.
Bailiff, have the deputies search the building. A HUBBUB rises. He bangs the gavel.
Under the circumstances, I have no choice but to recess this case until tomorrow morning at nine. Fletcher smiles serenly -- until --
-- Unless, of course, you think you can still proceed? Fletcher covers his mouth in a desperate attempt to avoid answering, but he can't repress the truth.
Can you?
Yes, I can.
Splendid. I admire your courage, Mr. Reid. I'll give you a few minutes to compose yourself, and then we'll get started. Fletcher looks as if he has just been sentenced to death.
Hello.
Dad...

Maxi-pad. How's it going?
Great. You know Paul and Emanuel from across the street?

I'11 be there. I gotta go now, Max. I'll see you in two hours. Max hangs up.
 He's really coming. She smiles, but she's worried. .
Mr. Reid, you remember Laurence Falk, the man from the tape.
How are you?
I've slipped into the seventh circle of Hell, thank you, and you? Virginia exchanges an anxious look with Falk.
Shouldn't we go over our testimony?
Well, basically the plan is I walk you through the tape step by step, I ask you questions--
And we give the explanation you came up with.
Exactly.
So all we have to do is lie. Sounds simple enough.
Do esn't it? And I'll finish up with a dramatic series of questions, something like... "Mr. Falk, isn't it true that you and Mrs. Cole have never made lo--" But Fletcher GAGS. He CAN'T GET THE QUESTION OUT.   The others look concerned, but he waves them off.
Sorry. I'm fine. "Mr. Falk, isn't it true that you and Mrs. Cole have never made lo--
 Oh my God! I can't do it! I can't finish the question if I know the answer is a lie! At this moment Miranda and Mr. Allan come up the steps.
Don't let me interrupt, Fletcher. I just want you to know I'll be observing this a fternoon. Miranda insisted I see you in action. Fletcher shoots a hateful look at Miranda. She smiles.
I'm looking forward to it. Go get 'em!
C'mon! Gotta rephrase the question!
Respondent calls... Lawrence Falk. Fletcher's clears his throat.       Here goes...
Mr. Falk, do you know my client, Virginia Cole?
Yes.
Isn't it true that your relationship with my client is entirely platonic, not? The "not" was INVOLUNTARY.       It takes everyone by surprise.
Excuse me?
If I might rephrase your Honor.  Is your relationship with my client entirely patonic, not?
Is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic? Is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic? (thinks he's got it, beams with
Mr. Falk, is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic?

What are you doing? Call me.
 I can't.
Mr. Reid?
Call me, damn it!
You don't understand. I can't lie . Until nine-sixteen tonight, I can't even.ask a question that calls for a lie! Virginia GRABS HIM BY THE TIE, pulls him CLOSE to her face.
L is ten , you bastard. I want m y money. I am not gonna wind up a 31 year old divorce on welfare because my scum bag attorney had a sudden attack of conscience! Fletcher suddenly stops -- focused on something Virginia said.
 Thirty-one?
Mr. Reid, we're not getting any younger... Fletcher quickly looks at the blowup of Virginia's prenup and her passport.
 Mr. Reid you have presented virtually nothing in the way of evidence and as such I have no choice but to rule in favor of --
 What the hell is he doing?
Kissing his career goodbye. The Baliff stands before the witness.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help -you God?
I do. Fletcher approaches,. CONFIDENT NOW, COCKY.
Mrs. Cole -- may I call you Virginia?
Yes.
But that would be a lie, wouldn't it?
What do you mean?
Isn't your true name...
Carlotta?!
Well, yes. But it wasn't me so I started using Virginia. Is there anything wrong with that?
Not really. It's just the first and smallest in the tissue of lies that is the Kleenex of your life. Let's take one simple document as a sample of your veracity, shall we, Carlotta? He grabs her purse from the desk, rifles through it,
Your driver's license. What color are your eyes?
Blue.
Tru e blue? What if I asked you to remove your contact l enses? What color would they be then?
And here it says you're a b l on de . Are you?  C'mon, Carlotta, there's a very easy way for us to check. If you don't remember, perhaps Mr. Falk will.
Brunette.
More like a dirty brown, isn't it?  Let's see - . - " Weight: one-o- five"? Please...
One-eighteen.
So on this single document, you basically lied at every opportunity. I'm sure a woman as vain as you would also lie about her age. It says you were born in 1964. What's the truth? 1962? '60? How young did you try to make yourself?
What? You're trying to tell us you lied to make yourself older?
Yes! "  lied so I could get married! So .there Mister 'I
went-to-law-school'!
Mr. Reid, does this have a point?
Oh, you bet it does, your Honor!  My client lied about her age because she was only 17 when s he got married. Which makes h er a minor. And in the great state of California, NO MINOR

In light of this new evidence, the court must rule in favor o f the defense. Mrs. Cole is hereby awarded half of the marital assets -or thirtyrseven million three hundred and ninety-five thousand dollars. The courtroom ERUPTS.       FLETCHER'S WON!      Dana, Mr. Cole are devastated.                    '
That son of bitch pulled it off! Mr. Allan gives Fletcher a thumbs-up; simultaneously, Miranda gives him the finger.
O r d e r ! Order!! Now i understand both parties have agreed to joint custody. Is that correct?
No!   I'm contesting custody.
What?
 Payback. For him trying to prevent me from collecting my thirty-seven million.
He was entitled to prevent you. You committed adultery.' You only won because you're a liar, remember? .
No. You pointed out that my husband took advantage of a poor underage girl. I was the vic tim here. And now I'm going to hit him where it hurts.
But -- but -- you said he was a good father.
M r. Reid? Do we have an agreement on custody or not? Fletcher takes a distressed look at the children.
No.                                            .
In that case, there will be a custody hearing tomorrow mor ning at nine. Court is adj ourned! He BANGS THE GAVEL. Everyone gets up, but Fletcher's attention is drawn to a commotion between Virginia and her kids.
Stop that! We're leaving now!

Screw that!! She lies and she wins ?! What are we, nuts? Everyone stops, watches Fletcher.

Yeah, thanks for the great game, Max. Emanuel knocks Max's hat off. Audrey's been watching from the door. She goes and sits by her son.
Max, honey. Your dad had a very big case today. It probably just--
I don't want to talk about it.
Okay.
Honey, don^t say that. Max is really upset. It's "that look" and then some. The look Audrey never wanted to see again. She makes a decision.
Max, there's something I-want to talk to you about. . .
p as si ng a phone) Pho ne call!! Phone call!! I g et to make a phone call!!
When would we move?
Soon. My semester's almost over. You only have a week left of school... You like Jerry don't you?  So what do you say, should we check it out? Jerry wants us to come with him tonight. He has to pick out a place to live and he really wants our help?
Could I get a sled for when it snows?
Of course you can. Max thinks, then:
Okay.
Answer! Answer!! Answer!! !
Hello.     .
Audrey!   It's Fletcher--
Wait, the most amazing thing's happened to me! I am feeling so good...
Max was sitting on the porch again, waiting for his dad. I won't let you do this to him anymore. I won't let you do this to me.
A ud rey , wait. Please, I need to talk to you. I .swear, I'm a changed man. Just come to the courthouse with a thousand dollars and bail me out... Hello?  O ne more call!! I need another call!!
And what about our water su pply ? You don't think "the man's" dumped enough toxins to render every dick in this cell as lifeless as a beached minn ow? You're damn rightJ "The man" does anything he w an ts. We're nothing but pu ppets... Little game pieces they move back and forth. A DEPUTY appears.     '
Mr. Reid.     ^
That's me. Fletcher T. Reid. Pawn no. 332-154-9867.
You made bail. Some woman.
Audrey?  Greta?!
Am I too late? Have you been se xu al ly molested yet? I could circle the block.
Greta! Greta!! . . . . Look at you, you well preserved, underpaid, overworked, underappreciated thing you. G iv e me a hug! You came and got me out!! Hug me!!
(totally wierded
Yes, well, I heard you went all noble in front of Mr. Allan so--
Y ou know what?! I love you. I loveyouloveyouloveyou. I wa nt to hug you. Come here..,
Mr. Reid, what has gotten intc to you?!
Just the truth, Greta. Fifteen years of being stuck in a lie is nowhere near as powerful as one day of being stuck in the truth.
Oh, my God!! I have to go! Thanks again, Greta! (as he runs off he calls back to
By the way, the truth is that I need you and I couldn't file a paperclip without you! Greta smiles, then catches herself, and quickly regains her "composure".
 Answeransweransweranswer... We HEAR a RECORDED VOICE:
The subscriber you called is either unavailable or outside the calling area.
Shit!!
A little going away present. I was gonna get you a bowl of clam chowder but they only had Manhattan.
Say thank you, Max.
Thanks.                     . Max takes off the hat his dad gave him and replaces it with the Boston hat.
 Shelton, Jerry Shelton. What time's that flight leave? 7:50. Thank you. (checks his
Oh, shit! Shit!! Shit! Fletcher spots the FLASHING LIGHTS.
Shiiiiit!!! He pulls over -- so quick he jumps the curb.
Would you step out of the car, please? Fletcher obeys.
Listen; I know I'm driving a little crazy but i have an emergency to attend to... The cop's just getting off his walkie talkie.
I'm impounding this vehicle.
W h y ? What for? For changing lanes?
I just ran your tags through the computer. You've got. seventeen unpaid parking tickets.
No ! I paid them! This morning! That's the truth!      I swear!!
Not according to the computer.
The computer is wrong! It ' hasn't been updated. The computer's a liar!
You can straighten it out at the impound yard.
EMPTY_LINE
No?
That's right, no! I'm not gonna lose my son because some stupid clerk was too lazy to update the computer. (getting cockier. as he goes) Now if you want to follow me, . you can follow me and take the car after I get where I'm going. I'm a lawyer and I k now my rights! Understand?!
A TOW TRUCK drives away with Fletcher's car, leaving Fletcher stranded.
T axi!    Taxi!! No luck. He spots
digs through the Yellow Pages. Finds "Ten Minute Taxi". Yes ! He fishes for change. Shit! He doesn't have any!!
(looking                    .
Noooo!!! He spots a man walking by.
'Scuse me, sir. Do you have any - - The man turns. It's the same BEGGAR Fletcher was rude to outside the courthouse.
Change? Absolutely. He continues walking.
Could you spare some?
Unquestionably. The beggar continues on.
Alright, I get your point. But this is a crisis! Look, I'll give you ten bucks. The beggar pulls out a quarter and holds it up.
It's so shiny and new.
Tw ent y.       .
Minted in Denver.      Imagine that.
Thirty-four. That's all I have. A moment as the beggar thinks, then:
It's worth twice that to screw you. He walks off, grinning.
Fletcher turns, spots a familiar building in the distance.
Whoa, where do you think you're going?
I just need to use the phone to call a cab. I work here.
Used to work here. Mr. Allan has just exited the elevator.
(to security
Son, that man is tresspassing. The guard starts toward Fletcher threateningly.
Hold it!  I've got ten years worth of dirt on you and this firm, and I'm in the kind of mood today to get a lot off my chest. You let me use the phone or I start talking!!
Fletcher's is THROWN ON HIS ASS in the street. Mr. Allan has watched from atop the stairs of the building.
Still euphoric, Reid? He goes back inside. Fletcher starts to get up when a CAR SCREECHES to a HALT, inches away.
Fletcher! It's PHILIP.
Seven-thirty... It's Karaoke time! Fletcher runs up and HUGS the astonished man,
You're saving my life, Philip.
You know, it's funny, but for some reason I was beginning to think you didn't like me. Isn't that silly?
No. It's not silly.       I don't like you.
What?
I don't like you. I'm sorry. I find you boring. I hate ch ara des . And you wouldn't know a good time if it sat on your face.  I'm sorry. It was easier than telling you how I really felt. Are you upset? A moment, then:
No. To be honest, I don't like you either. You treat people like obstacles and you cheat at charades. .
Then why are you always trying to socialize with me?
You're a client. I figured if I didn't try to be your friend, you'd get a new accountant.
Philip, I don't like you as a person, but I'm crazy about you as my accountant. I ' d never hire a new accountant. Never!
So we don't have to like each other anymore?
Not at all.
All right. Sooner I get you to the airport, sooner I can dump your sorry ass off.
Bedelayed. Bedelayed. Fog, rain, something, anything... He sees the DEPARTURE BOARD " F li g ht 69. Departs 7:50. On Time. Gate 17." Fletcher looks at the clock -- It's 7:46!!   Holy Shit!!
Excuse me. . . excuse me. . . Come on folks, let's let the frantic man pass... Sorry... Thank... you... Standing on the right, passing on the left. They can't make this- deal any easier than it is... Come on... coming through... At the top,- a WOMAN in a NURSES UNIFORM asks for money...
Help the poor?...
 I don't trust you. I don't know what the hell that uniform is. Sorry. (a Hare Krishna tries to stop
Please step through again.
Ahhh!! !    Damn..; Fletcher frantically tosses his keys, cufflinks, his Rolex into a tray. He tries again.     It BUZZES again!
What? I'tii practically naked! A guy in a TURBAN passes over him with a DETECTOR WAND.
It's called a ZIPPER, Hodgy...
Can I help you?
Look out!! ! --
The woman raises her eyebrows and looks anyway. And Fletcher BOLTS THROUGH THE EXIT!
an insane idea. . . The worker hears an ENGINE START, looks up to SEE FLETCHER in the truck, driving off, TOWING THE STAIRS.
Hey!!      Hey!!!! But Fletcher's gone.
In case of a water landing, please use your seat cushion
Her MOUTH DROPS as she notices Fletcher.
Then, Fletcher looks ahead and his EYES GO WIDE!
The RUNWAY is ENDING!.
(checks under his
It's right here, honey.
Mom!   Mom!!               '
Just a second, Max.
Mom, it's dad!
W hat? What about dad? Audrey turns. Then she sees Fletcher WAVING weakly...
Fletcher?!
(mumbles to
Oh boy, the truth hurts.   Yes indeed.
Mr. Reid. Someone made bail for you.
 Sorry I made you miss your flight, not really.  You're obviously a little . upset, not that I blame you... although I'll bet you'll still get the bonus miles. . .
Fletcher, are you crazy? What were you doing?
That's two questions. A; Yes, but I think the legal term is temporarily insane. And B; I was trying to finally have that talk with you about Boston. Audrey's patience are growing thin...
Okay, okay... The whole truth and nothing but the truth, (with difficulty,
I tried to stop the plane because it was taking off with my life... you and Max. This comes as a surprise to Audrey. Not just what Fletcher said, but the way he said it.
I know you've met somebody... somebody pretty great... and the truth is I wish you didn't but you did and... All I ' m asking i s . . . Please don't move to Boston. Please don't take Max away. She's definitely moved by Fletcher, but not convinced.
You can come visit anytime. It's only a four hour flight.
I don't want to visit him. That's what I've been doing-- visiting him, dropping by, stopping in. I want to be in his life. I don't want to be some jerk that sees him at Easter. I want to be his father. Fletcher turns to Jerry.
I know I have no right to ask, but can I talk you out of taki ng that job? I can get you a better job here in L.A. I've got all kinds of connect ions... what do you do again?
I design security systems.
How symbolic. Okay great. You know Pac-Tec?
The biggest.
One of their systems shorted out and burned down a supermarket. I got them off. Another proud day for justice. If I ask them they'll beat your Boston offer in two s ec on ds .    ..
Don't put Jerry in the middle.
It's okay.  Boston means this (snaps his
to me. All I want is for this lady and Max to be happy. Preferably, with me. Whatever they want, I'll go along with. They both look to Audrey.
All I want is for Max to be happy. Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the stairs. He's still upset.
You better know your jury. You're hot exactly Max's hero today.
Just let me present my case. Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING,
I have been sent from the future to destroy you. . . Argghhh! (no response, a
You mad at me? Max nods. Fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. Then:
You wanted me to stop lying. But lying isn't the problem. .. Why we lie ~ that's the problem. Sometimes we lie to make someone else feel better. But sometimes we lie because the truth gets in our way...  But being an adult means you sacrifice some things for more
 Malfunction in vector one. All this time you've been here and I could see you anytime I felt like it. And I... didn't. Please don't go to Boston. Max, I love you more than anything else in the world and you know it's true. I couldn't say it if it weren't true. Not today. A moment as Max studies his father, then:
 He's telling the truth, Mom. He's not allowed to lie. I made a wish and anything Dad says has to be the truth. .. Right? But Fletcher's looking at his watch...
Max. .. it's 9:22.
What?
Max, you made the wish at 9:15. I've been able to lie for the last seven minutes. Max steps away from Fletcher.
So then, you were...
No! It wasn't a lie. I just wanted to be honest with you and tell you -- there was no wish to guarantee it anymore. You just have to believe me. Max looks at Audrey, who is letting Max decide for himself Max looks at Fletcher and tries to decide.
 Mommy... do we have to go to Boston? Audrey looks at Jerry, then back at Max.
No.      We don't have to. Fletcher hugs his son -- the kind of hug that says "I'll never let you go."
 Can we play catch tomorrow? Fletcher smiles. . .
Dad! !
Ma x i mu m ! ! Fletcher picks Max up.
Transformer!!! . Fletcher and Max do the TRANSFORMER ROUTINE again...
Malfunction in vector seven. I have lost control of my affection reflex... Fletcher starts KISSING MAX on the head over and over. He sees Audrey.
Procreate!          Procreate!
Come on, dad, let's play catch!!
Sr. . .
(starts to toss
Here you go, mom.  Oh, you mean with a ball... He puts Max down. Max runs into position. Fletcher stops for a second and turns to Jerry, man to man.
I take back every dirty, dishonest thing I ever said about you, wrote about you, faxed about you, E-mailed about you.
Appreciated. Fletcher tosses the baseball up and down.
So, you up for a little friendly competition?
No, you go play with your son.
I wasn't talking about basesball. A slow smile from Jerry. Fletcher winks and tosses the ball to Max.
 Alright, it's time to show you the old Fletcher Reid change up.
