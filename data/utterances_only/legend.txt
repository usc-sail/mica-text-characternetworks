from the hilltop, through ferns and brambles to a steep embankment where umbrella-sized toadstools cluster.
ANIMALS
Kill. . . . !
. . . . Fast as a hound dog with his ass on fire. . . .
What's that . . . . ? L-l-let me see, old chap.
No! It's mine!
Give it to m-m-m-me!
Turn loose, anus features!
Hard cheese!
It's mine you rectum! Mine! Mine!
Disgusting and pure, like a prayer. . .. There be magic in this hair. The beast ran off, faster and faster. We must take this to our Master.
Wish i was still a leprecaun. . . . Stay clear of nasty places like this and do nothing all day but sing and dance and guzzle wine in the sunshine. . . .
Shhhh!
Shhhh!
Shhhh!
SHHHHH!
Run. . . . ! Panic. . . . ! Emergency. . . . ?
Frog spit!
Snail Sperm!
All together. . . .now or never!
J-j-jolly good! Team spirit and all that!
Poor Tic. . . .
Forget Tic! Less is always more.
Better we spilt three ways than four!
Boost me. . . . ! Hurry. . . . ! We must sound the summons before the dawn. . . .
Now what. . . . ?
We sit. . . . We wait. . . . That be our fate!
Moving silent like the breeze. Soft as shadows, still as trees, Darkness be in all we sees. He lives in silence, he lives in fire, He lives in all that's dark and dire.
Look in the gloom, search out the tomb. That be where you find our sire.
Hail O great One. . . . divine and dark! Strong like a lion, swift like a shark.
Though I'm not worthy of the task Great Lord, I found this for your amusment.
Don't listen to them mealy-mouthed lies boss. . . . I'm the one who found it. . . . Me! Blunder the Bold!
Thank you, Lordship . . . .
Quite stylish, actually. . . .
Where. . . . ?
In the woods, six leagues back, 'Tween Twin Oaks and the Dragon's Track.
Did my bold hunters chance to see quarry which cast this spoor?
I stalked it, Sire, but much too slow, What beast it be I do not know.
This hair is from an angel of light. . . It comes this way rarely. . . I must have this creature!
Oh Divine Dark One, teach us how to catch this creature.
Your instruction would be m-m-most ap-p-preciated.
Amen! I wants to learn! I craves knowledge!
No trap of yours will work. . . . There is only lure for such disgusting goddness. . . .one bait which never fails. . . .
Name the bait, Lord. . . .
Innoncence!
Come down sparrow, sing me good morning. Rise up sun, light the arch of the sky. Living river, turn light to diamonds, When I look in my true love's eyes.
Darkness say the perfect lure Always be a virgin pure. . . .
Dad-blamed faeries!
God Bless Your Highness. A royal visit is ever a joy.
I've not come to visit, Nell
Won't you stay for a tart?
They're fresh-baked.
I've no time today.
The Princess must have a sweetheart waiting.
Nonsense!
Surely the king forbids such folly
What my father doesn't know won't hurt him.
The wilful heart invites despair, Like blind men creeping in a dragon's lair.
Neither country provebs nor king's command can keep me out of the woods today.
Then it's common sense ought. These woods be thick with spriggen and banshee!
Is that why you've hung a bell over the door?
Aye, and spread the floor with flax and salt. My babe won't be stole by faeries.
More salt, Nell. . . .! You'll worry yourself to death if you're not careful.
Beware of toadstool rings and willow trees. . . . ! Stay away from old oaks!
May be innocent. . . . May be sweet. . . . Ain't half as nice as rotten meat. . . . !
Jack. . . . ! I know you're here. . . . Jack!
Jack? Where are you. . . . ? Answer me!
Oh, Jack. . . . please say something if you're here. . . .
Jack! You scared the life out of me.
She brings a gift as fair as herself.
You're so clever, Jack. . . . See what you can find in the flowers.
Mmmmmmm. . . .
Sweet?
Sweets from the sweet.
I know someone sweeter.
That was very good. . . .just right.
Teach me rabbit like you promised.
Rabbit is much harder than wren.
Let me try. I'm a very good student. . . . My father thinks I'm brilliant. . .
See how brilliant I am!
Stop it. . . . ! I can't see!
Don't I dazzle you with my wisdom?
Much more than wisdom dazzles me.
Then teach me rabbit.
Not today. . . . There's something really special I promised to show you.
Oh, Jack. Do you mean it?
If it pleases you.
More than anything!
This is their season. They won't pass here again for a long, long time. . . . If you want to see them, you must do everything I tell you.
I swear. . . on my honour!
I'm taking you to a very special place. . . it's sort of sacred. Nobody but me knows where it is, and, well. . . .
What? Tell me!
You'll have to wear a blindfold.
Don't you trust me, Jack?
I'll always trust you, Lili. . . .
Storm's coming. . . .
Who cares? Haven't you a cosy place to hide?
Many places. . . .None fit for a princess. . . .
In these woods you are the prince, Jack. . . . I am only a pauper here. . . .
Yuck! Did you see what he was gonna do? Makes me want to puke!
I swear by all the bats above, Nothing's quite so foul as love!
Oh, Jack. . . .! It's magic!
How much longer?
Be patient!
I'm thristy!
It's poisened the brook. No animal will drink here now.
I want some water.
Shhh!
Don't tell me to be quiet. . . .! I'm a princess!
Just watch! True royalty approaches. . . .
Ohh....They're so beautiful....
The alicorn purifies the water. . . .
There's no creature with more power or magic. . . . As long as they roam the earth, evil cannot harm the pure of heart. . . .
Ugly one-horned mules!
Shhh!
Such grace. . . . Can you speak their language?
A little. . . .it's very hard. Unicorns talk only of love and laughter. Dark thoughts are almost impossible for them to express.
Oh Jack. . . I must touch one.
No!
I want to!
It is forbidden. These are sacred animals.
Nothing is forbidden me!
Don't ever say that! You risk your immortal soul.
You sound like my confessor. . . . I only want to touch one.
Like a child feels watching a rainbow. Like a brid feels the first time it flies I feel magic stirring within me, When I look in my true love's eyes.
M-m-might as well be fish in a barrel. . . One would hope for a t-t-touch more sp-p-port. . . .
Pox! Shut your yap!
When the darkness falls like a curtain And the rivers and streams turn to ice, I have summer and daylight forever When I look in my true love's eyes.
Steady....take your time.... Don't miss...
Oh, Jack, it was so lovely... like a dream.
You're lucky it wasn't a nightmare!
Don't be such a scold.... Come, I'll chase your fears away.
Sweet William did a-hunting go, In the wood where faeries dwell. From dawn to dusk roamed he to and fro, Lost, O lost, all under thier spell.
Came he at last to where bluebells grow, He heard them ring, 'tis true to tell. He lay him down and did not know The flower's sound was his own death knell.
When I get to heaven, I know just how the angels will sound.
Do you flatter all the girls like that, Jack?
Are you afraid of my kiss?
I'm afraid you'll break my heart.
Then still your heart... You are dear to me as life itself.
Only because I amuse you...Like some trained bear!
That's not true! I do love you, Jack. You must believe me!
And if I so....no good can come from it. I am only a Green Man, without land or title...no name or wealth to bring you.
What does it matter. I don't care about any of that.
But it does matter....! If not now....Someday. What about when the time comes for you to marry?
I want to marry you.
That's impossible!
Not if it's what you really want, Jack.
Don't you wish this was our wedding ring?
What if I say yes...? Will my wish come true?
It is my right as a princess to set a challenge for my suitors.
I will marry whoever finds this ring.
We got him now....! We got him now!
Jack! Help me!
Jack!
Oh, dear God.... Jack..... no....
....got to get help!
Lili....!
Nell....! Arthur....!
Nell....? Oh, nooooo!
Mortal world turned to ice, Here be goblins' paradise!
Lots to eat!
I s-s-simply adore m-m-milk-fed meat!
What're you....? Some kinda animal?
Why eat cold? It's better hot!
Am-m-mazing! How did you d-d-d-do that, old, ch-ch-chap?
M-m-most amusing Blix....most terribly amusing.
This is sure our lucky day. Killed that ugly one-horn dead as a cowplop on a birthday cake!
Prattle, prattle like a priest!  It was me who shoot the beast!
Without the p-p-princess for bait, you'd never gotten close.... B-b-beauty brought the b-b-beast to bay.
She's so sweet....I could eat her brains like jam!
I'd like such her b-b-bones!
Better hurry! Can't be late!
When we deliver that horn, Pox ol' buddy, Darkness gonna give us a humongous big reward.
Oh, God.... God....
You're a wicked, wicked girl!
The world is in a fine mess because of you.
Words...mere words.... Bolds deeds be needed now! Look at you! Pampered and soft! Never done a day's work in your life....
Who are you?
Me...? I'm the house brownie... I keep dust devils under the bed and all the china cracked.... You know how a watched pot never boils? I do that...and I'm a wizard at turning sweet milk sour....
Blunder! Move your butt! On the double!
Thank God....
Can you....help me?
Can I what?
Help me....
I'd like to....but I'm a domestic sort of chap....no good at all where demons are concerned....
Then I'll do it myself! I'll follow those goblins....somehow..... even if it costs my life!
I like your spirit! There's always hope when a brave heart back a noble cause.... but what chance have you? They have the alicorn! The power is theirs!
I will do it! You'll see....I fooled them now, didn't I.... Well, I'll do it again easy as pie....
Wait....! Take this....!
'Tis from the tail of the cockatrice.... Make you as fleet as a running deer. And better, when things seem at their darkest, 'twill remind you always that hope is alive....
Thank you....Hope is just what I need.
Lili....! Lili....!
What's happened....
Lili....!
God rest your soul.... I know you won't mind if I borrow your things.
TRANSPOSED TO 46D
What....?
Who're you?
Who's there....?
Here you be a forest child and not know the Gump....
Gump, is it?
Aye, Jack.... Honeythorn Gump at your service.....
stick's rubbing, logs being thumped, etc.
How d'you know my name?
How does a migrating swallow know the way south in winter....? Or a spawning salmon find the tiny freshet of his birth from the black cold depths of the mysterious sea....? I know everything, Jack!
Everything....? Why has this happened? Why is it winter now?
I'd be a powerful wizard indeed could I answer....  Suppose you tell me , Jack.
Me? How can I do that?
You know these woods as well as any elf.... Did you not see something odd today? Any strange spirits? Did nothing untoward happen?
No....well.... I took Lili to see the unicorns.....
You did what?
What....? Codfish and cockles....! Never....! Pewterpots and.... pumpkins....! Poo-poo pudding....! Doo-doo dumplings....! Shit-willy whatnot....!
Silence!
Oh God, she touched him....
Touched it! A mortal laid hands on a unicorn?
Bad....terrible bad!
We meant no wrong.
What was it you did mean, Jack!
Nothing....
Nothing, he calls it!
I wanted to share something special with her.
Well.... I have something now to share with you....a lively reel to warm your bones!
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Squawk! Squawk! No more talk.... Do you think you can upset the order of the universe and not pay the price?
seashell trumpets, acorn cellos, gossets, serpentines, blossom-bell horns, bone flutes, all manner of drums and rattles.
No! I want no part of your nonsense.
Time to dance, Jack!
No...! Please....!
Round and round and round and round, Before you're lost, you must be found The tempo increases. The musicians leap and cavort.
In and out and up and down, Behind each smile there lurks a frown.
Spin and spin and spin and spin, To learn to lose you first must win.
Twist and reel and toe and heel, The end to pain is to learn to feel!
Enough!
Is the music not to your liking?
I....won't....go....on...Take my life, if you must.... What I did is unforgiveable.... But, I did it for love! And I'd do it again! I love Lili with all my heart and would sooner die than break a promise!
Hmmmm..... Love, you say....? Love is another story....
I meant no disrespect....
Answer me this riddle and all is forgiven.
And if I cannot?
Why, Jack....then 'tis your death song I'll be playing.
Ask away, and pray God my answer pleases you.
What is a bell that does not ring, Yet, its knell makes the angels sing?
Bluebells!
What?
The flower. Bluebells. To hear then ringing means your life is at an end.
Damnation! Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!
Rabbot noodles....! Schweinhundt saukraut mit schlagober....! Piddle-puddles und ka-ka crumpets....! Piss pots and thunder mugs! Demkopf doo-doo brains riddle-widdler!
You bested me, Jack.... Bested me.... bested me...
A riddle with an answer is like an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
Well spoke! And if it's wine you want, it's wine we shall have.
A small measure of entertainment at best.
Elderberry wine....no finer drink under heaven.
Here's to Jack....riddle-solver.... dancing fool, and faerie friend.
I'm honoured, Gump....But no more tricks!
Here be precious summertime frozen into a winter memory and the blamed fool won't drink faerie wine for fear of enchantment.
Pranks....! Is that all you're good for....! I've lost Lili....! Gump! Help me! Use your magic to find her.... set the world right.
Changing this frozen hell is beyond my modest powers.
Is there nothing you can do?
If you want more tricks, I'm your man.... but, for big questions, you must go elsewhere.
But don't you care what's happened?
Course we care.... What good's the world locked in a season of death? No folks to scare on a summer's night....
No babies to tickle....
No lovers to tease....
No more spells to cast....Does that sound like an enjoyable prospect?
We must find the answer!
That we must. But first, we better see that no harm's come to the unicorns.
I sadly fear the worst....
What can you do when there's Nothing to be done? Sing a little song And have fun, fun, fun....
This is goblins' work.... Powerful demons are agaisnt us!
Take cover, laddies!
Run, Jack!
The fault was mine. I owe her my life.
Nobly spoken, lad, and nobility is her gift in return.
What's he saying? What's it mean?
Search me.... I speak some rabbit, but not a word of unicorn.
Come on Jack, don't keep us in the dark.
The dark is where we'll stay.... We're cursed. All warmth and light was lost when the stallion died.
Is there naught we can do?
We must get the alicorn back. Only then will the world return to normal.
And how do faeries fight a demon?
She says we're to find a champion.... a mortal, bold of heart and pure in spirit.
Look....! Look....!
That is the warmth of her soul. Not even death's icy hand can stop it!
Little good her soul'll do us now.
Screwball's right. Where we gonna find a champion when every mortal can swing a sword is froze stiff as an icicle?
Don't give up so quick, lads.  You sure you're mortal?
Course I am!
What sort of mortal speaks unicorn?
Why aren't you frozen then?
I don't know.... I was underwater.... and when I came up for air, everything was covered with ice.
You'll do.... We best get you some weapons.
Weapons....? What are they?
He's no champion, Gump.
We'll have to make him one.... or kill him trying....! Follow me!
What can you do when there's nothing to be done? Sing a little song And have fun, fun, fun....
Look at us! Waiting around like lackies....and for what? We're the ones with the power!
You shouldn't talk like, Blix. We gets in plenty big trouble!
I'm not afraid! Not even Darkness lasts forever!
Watch out, Pox!
Higher.... higher.... Burning fire! Making music Like the choir!
Higher.... higher.. Burning fire! Making music Like a choir!
Greetings, Worship....
W-w-welcome, Great Lord.... D-d-darkest of the ....
Your devotion disgusts me? You insignificant strands of toad slobber!
Hear me, you angels of light! Your reign is over! A new order begins! All the imps of Hell will dance freely over this dark land.... I hold the power....
Enough!
Please.... It was only a joke... I didn't mean it.... Honest....!
Whatsamatter? Have you no sense of humour? I hope you choke of faerie breath and flower petals!
Did you think this alicorn a mere plaything....? With it my empire is eternal! Before I ruled only the night. Now, my minions will frolic in darkness until the end of time.
Forgive this intrusion.... My goblins are a free-spirited lot. I like to encourage their.... initiative. What do you think of this policy, Master?
What is this light...?
You killed the final unicorn.... Is this not true?
This is true....
Undeniably t-t-true, Lord.
You lie! Here is dawn!
Well.... almost t-t-true.... ess-s-sentially true....
That stallion is dead, dead as dreams, dead as legend....
OUT WITH IT!
But.... but.... the m-m-mare still lives...
If even one unicorn walks the earth, my power is not complete....
Just a female.... She has no power... The ground grows very light. Darkness melts into the campfire.
Only the power of creation....? Get that female....! I command you.... In the name of Darkness....
Jack....! Ja-aack!
Ja-aack.... Ja-aack....
Lili....?
Jack....? Oh, Jack....
Please God.... help me!
Here's my home, Jack.... What d'you think of that for a front door?
Be some job in getting it open.
Think you so?
Morning', Gump....
After you, Jack....
Thank you....
Brown Tom. Stay here with the unicorn and guard her well.
Like me own life!
Better than that! She's the last of her kind.
Right this way....
Home, sweet home!
gemstones, pearls, chests heaped with gold coins.
Fit for a king's ramsom!
Such riches.... I feel I must be dreaming....
If life is a dream, better you dread the waking!
....beautiful....
Mere trinkets.... Let's find you something useful.
Stop it....! Go away....!
Easy.... Luna only seeks a little affection.
I meant no disrespect, but.... ouch! Make her stop, will you, Gump!
Does your blood run so cold? You'll be a corpse before your time.
What does she want from me?
Foolish question....  Drink, and wamr your heart. The answer's at the bottom of your cup.
Now then.... down to business.
What's this....? Something to cook with?
This is a weapon, Jack.... As fine a weapon as you'll ever see.
So, that's a weapon.... What's it do?
World is doomed, if you ask me.
A little demonstration.
With such a blade you could behead an ogre as easily as uncapping a soft-boiled egg.
That's really something.... Can I try?
You're the champion, aren't you?
Watch out....! You'll get the hang of it in time.... Now, we best see about some armour..... Screwball!
Coming right up!
Go on.... see if it fits.
It will turn a broadhead arrow ar fifty yards.
He might pass for a champion in that.
Have a look at yourself, Jack. (pointing Use yonder shield for a mirror.
....Shield?
The round shiny thing over there.
Clothes never made the man....
Hmmm... getting late. Almost half- way past the morning mayfly hatch... SCREWBALL Too cold for mayflies now.... 'Sides, I ain't got no timepeice.
You first must know how to tell the time.
I ain't got nothing....
No more chatter....! I've got work to do.
Think I'll brew some tea.
Colt's foot and sassafrass... Maybe a spot of spearmint.... St John's Wort not bad.... and a little foxglove.
What....? What....? Who's there?
I'm Princess Lili.... I.....
You! You're the cause of all our sorrow!
I know it was wrong.... Everything is my fault.  Please.... please forgive me.
I ain't the one ye should be asking.
I want to make it up to her.... I followed the goblins! They gave the alicorn to the Lord of Darkness!
Good lass! You're a plucky little partridge at that.
We can't stay here! It's not safe! Darkness sent the goblins to hunt the mare... If I found her, so will they....We msut go!
Too late!
If you imps're looking for a fight, ye've come to the chap who'll oblige ye.
Kill....! K-k-kill...! Kill...!
Dick-o-Tuesday's duck! They've done for me!
Forty leagues from the Dragon's Track.... another half-span past the basilisk den.
Wirrikows and dopplegangers!
Spot of tea, Gump....? Help calm your nerves...
Not now! I'm busy with navigation.
That's not so bad.... What do you think, Luna?
I think you look like a hero.
What! H'd you do that?
Magic....
Nobody knows nut you. it's our secret....  Promise?
Don't do that.
Better promise....
All right, all right.... I promise.
Hmmmm...? Screwball!
Something I can do for you, Gump?
Hand it over....!
Well, well, well.... how'd that get in there? Must be some kinda magic...
Sneak thief's magic!  Jack! it's time we were on our way!
I'm ready as I'll ever be....
Brown Tom....? You can't be dead....! Oh, this is is terrible.... terrible!
Why, Wisp.... they kill you, too?
Course they didn't! What in blazes are you talking about?
Goblins shot me through the brain pan.
Your brains are one spot an arrow'd do no harm!
Where's the unicorn?
I'm afeered the goblins took her. Did me best to fight them off, but they swarmed up by the hundreds.... Horrid creatures they were. The Princess warned me, but....
Princess Lili?
Aye.
She's alive!
She was living still when they killed me.
You'll earn your champion's spurs this day, Jack.... We'll follow their tracks in the snow. Foul weather's on our side for a change.
Hail m-most great, and d-d-darkest of the dark!
Though we be nothing in your sight, We bow before your strength and might!
Can you fawning sycophants do more than grovel? What of the task I set you?
D-d-done, Lord. We have the m-m-m-m-m-m.... the unicorn.
Where is she?
In the dungeon like a treasure, Awaiting your darkest pleasure.
Very good.... You two are not entirely devoid of talent.
There's m-m-more, Sire....
Though unworthy of your magnificence, Trifles without consequence, We present with all due deference.... A gift.
Gift....? What sort of gift?
This thing you once called innocence.
Innocence...? I must behold this wonder....
Legend says the Dark Castle stood in olden days when evil anarchy ruled the land.... The wicked still come here to sacrafice.
They worship the demon....
It's ugly! I hate it!
Good! You shall go first....
Darkness. For the briefest instant, we see the smouldering eyes of the demon GLOWING in anitcipation out of the shadows.
Go on! Hurry up!
All the time me. Same old story.
Screwball!
What was that?
Big trouble!
We've got to do something.
Foul tasting faerie.....! Come to me, juicy boy!
Who be this tender morsel disturbing Meg Mucklebones' rest?
They call me Green Jack ma'am.
Our champion's a goner, he is.
What a fine fat boy you are....
You don't mean to eat me, do you ma'am?
Oh, indeed I do....
That would be a shame, Miss Meg. You're so lovely. You deserve far better than scrawny little me....
Hmmmm....think me fair, do you, Jack?
All the heavenly angels must envy your beauty.
Ooooo....what a find meal you'll make, be the rest of you as sweet as your tongue.
Let me go and I'll sing songs of praise to you.
Let you go? Don't be daft. I've had naught but muskrat and snakes all this month.... bit of rancid goblin, too....
But....but....don't you like my words?
Words are little help in filling an empty stomach....
Then fill your soul with loveliness. Look into your glass and feast on beauty.
There's no looking-glass here.... Sometimes, when the moon is full, I'll chance to see my reflection in the bog.
My shield would serve you well.
What a splendid idea! You be so clever, Jack.
Your radiance is the alchemy that makes rusted steel shine like silver.
Oooo! That's nice! I be the envy of any princess in the land.
Better, you are a queen without a peer.... a reigning angel.
You have such discerning taste for so young a boy....
Come, Jack....give us a kiss before dining.
Give her the kiss of cold steel, Jack!
I did it!
Like a chmapion, Jack.
Bravo!
How's Screwball?
Chewed, but not disgested....
Then on to victory!
On to victory!
I've been an exile for too long.... banished by the sun.... forced to hide in the bowels of the earth.... On the eve of my greatest victory, this.... child of nature appears.... It has been an eternity since I felt such desire.... I could know her in an instant. She is helpless.... and yet....  What is wrong with me, Father?
You hold the world in your grasp.... Supreme power belongs to you... yet your triumph is meaningless!
Meaningless?
What do you gain from it? What pleasure comes from ruling a pack of imps and goblins....? Souls already black.... This innocent creature fascinates you because only she can appreciate the enormity of your achievement.
I'll take her then!
A hollow victory! She remembers the world as it was, when she loves your new order you will triumph! Woo her.... win her.... break her spirit....
Thank you, Father.... Your wisdom is ever my guide.
Remember.... She must desire you.... nothing else matters!
What's that?
For our protection, Jack. You must be ready.... Remember, Darkness is a liar.... a treacherous fiend! Don't listen to him. Never believe what you see.....
He won't fool me.
Don't be so sure! No human has ever set foot in this place before! 66 INTERIOR GREAT TREE DAY
What a nice big trumpet....! Bet it sounds louder than anything....
Don't touch it! Our lives are lost if it blows!
In here! I've found a passage!
I feel a presence....! Some power invades my sanctity....
Every wolf suffers fleas.... 'tis easy enough to scratch!
The decor of death....
Tells you somthing 'bout him what lives here.
It's a dead end....
Doesn't make sense.... Check the walls. There must be some sort of secret key....
One-two-three.... fidde-dee-dee....
Screwball! Drop those this minute!
Newt-finger marmalade!
Oh, dear.... Oh, dear...
When times're hard and thing look bad, Don't feel blue and don't feel sad....
How can you sing at a time like this?
Can you think of anything better to do?
Ouch! Ow!
Where are we?
Some place we don't want to be!
Shhhh! What is this? A chatterbox convention? SCREWBALL Who be you, bucket-head?
Stay clear of that imp! He's a hell hound goblin!
What I am won't help me none, nor you neither....
....even if you is my brother!
Screwball....!
A Buttercup family reunion....! I can't believe it.... Last I remember, he sold Screwball a jug of dragon's tears that turned out to be cow piss!
What happened to you?
It's a long story.... Let's just say I went look for adventure and found more'n I could handle.... Doesn't matter now anyway... We're all of us in the same fix....
Just what sort of fix is that?
The kitchen of the Lord of Darkness! All of us be on his menu!
I knew it! I knew it! Should of stayed at home....
That's right, brother, me'n you is barbeque!
Wish I had a drink....
Only dead meat waits for the stewpot! Spring the lock, Gump!
Iron is sore trouble for elves.
Magic's no good against it.
I know I promised.... but it's the only way....
Sure it's a secret... It'll keep forever when we're all dead....
Why not have Luna fly out between the bars and find a key?
She's much too small.... could never lift it...
Not if she changes sizes like she can!
What?
You wilful sprite! How dare you keep such secrets?
They're mine to keep! But I'll do what you ask.... if you kiss me, Jack.
That's easy enough.
Call that a kiss? Am I not sweet?
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Sweet is the wind thats blows me to you....
It's not possible. I'm in love....
A faerie's love makes anything possible....
....even you heart's desire.
No.... this isn't real....
Oh, but it is.... I'm warm and alive and happy to be in your arms.
I can't do it....! This is faerie glamour!
You....! You....mortal! I could vex you! Dance you life away!
Threats can't make you love you. Human hearts don't work that way.
What care I for human heart? Soft and spiritless as porridge! A faerie's heart beats fierce and free.
Luna....?
I.... didn't mean to hurt her.
Your fine senseibilities have left us here to rot.
....this li'l piggie went to market.... anudder li'l pigge got eat.... pig-meat pie, l'l piggie die....
Oh, no! He's coming...! Hide! Hide! Hide!
Blunder's got the right idea!
....pig-pig-pig... The Cook gropes inside the cage.
Help....! Lemme go...? Turn me loose, you tub o' guts!
I hope I give you heart-burn!
Fricasseed faeries, the lot of us....
Lambs to the slaughter....
Not without a fight!
Luna....!
You look like mourners at your own funeral.
Come back to dance on our graves!
I'd gladly frolic on Jack's....
....but this cage shan't be your tomb!
Well done!
Lemme outta this stink hole!
Mind you bleeding foot!
Shhhh!
Keep behind me in case there's trouble.
Terrible sight for a sober man to see....
Quiet!
Whut be there?
....Back in the frying pan!
Be it live victuals?
Hey....! Lard belly!
Whut say, pip-squeak?
Two things down here look just alike!
Wuzzat?
Your face and my ass!
Bash in you face! Den it no be so pretty!
Whut you got to say now, pork pie?
Do you feel it, Father....? A force....loose in my domain....
Guard well what is yours!
BRING INNOCENCE TO ME!
Wish we could repay the favour!
My brother can take of himself.
Screwball's right! It's more important we find the unicorn.
And Lili!
Where do we start?
We must find the dungeons. Legend has is they house such sirriw that death is a gift....albeit one rarely granted.
Think I'll stay right here thank you very much.
Not so fast! You search with the rest of us!
All right! I'm going with Jack!
No you won't. Be faster if we split up.
Fine! I'm going this way!
I'm going that way!
Wait....! Better to search in teams, Gump and me together. Brown TOm, you and Screwball look in the other direction.
Right! Let's synchronise! We meet back here in twice five hundred beats of a bluebird's heart.
Best to allow another couple dozen butterfly breaths in case we get thirs....er, get lost....
No grog shops down here, Brown Tom.
Let's hurry!
Know what I want to know?
What?
Why me?
Why not?
I hate it....I hate it.... I hate it....
Quick, Jack!
I'll scramble that one!
Don't trust your eyes! All is enchanted here.
Not even kings live like this....
My God! Gump, look! It's Lili!
Don't believe it, Jack.
Lili !
Li-li ! The Princess does not respond, wobbling like a dreamer on the narrow edge of disaster. She leans against the ruined parapet and a bug chunk of masonry breaks away, tumbling and bouncing into the abyss.
It's Ja-ack !
It's her. I know it.
Don't be so hasty! Remember who we're dealing with.
I've got to reach her!
My enemies approach.... destory them! Darkness points an evil finger and the Pygmies scurry CACKLING off.
Slow down....! Use some caution!
This way!
There she is....! Lili....!
Jack!
Demons!
Quick! In here!
Trapped....!
Come on!
Lili! Wait!
Don't be daft! She's under a spell!
Why did you stop me?
We best reconnoitre. What if it's a trap?
Do not be afraid, lady....
I mean you no harm.
How like you my gifts...? Does the gown not please you? Come.... tell me....
The colour is most suitable... We sanctify the death of the old world and the birth of a new order.... You are the guest of honour.
....of dishonour...! Take this away.... Please! I beg you!
Your soul in like some dark nectar.... I cannot rest unril I taste its sweetness.
Never! I hate you! I hate this dress!
Can you speak so of your bridal gown....?
Nooooooooo!
What has he done to her?
You have no power to stop it.... Be thankful she lives.
Some champion.... What good is this fancy sword?
It's not the sword that counts, but the man who swings it....
Why the tears?
....everything is lost.... poor Jack....
Why weep for him? He left you alone to die!
No! He'd never do that! He was killed....like everything else....
Yes.... But why mourn? You have a new and grander destiny!
Consort of some cowardly vile toad who slinks through the night!
Not so! I requite to shadow's solace and dark of the night.... Sunshine is my destroyer!
You think you're so powerful.... and hide in the ground like a mole!
This too will change. The last unicorn dies tonight....! As her blood ebbs, the sun sets forever. There shall never be another dawn!
No....! You can't.... You mustn't....
He means to kill the mare, Gump!
Don't mourn the corpse 'til the coffin's in the ground.
My dominion shall encompass the enternal night!
As long as the sun still shines, so does hope!
Sun doesn't shine down here.
Wait a minute....! I think I know a way.
The world shall be at last as nature intended....a place of chaos and anarchy!
You're mad!
Aye, Lady, and proud to be so! For in madness lies the soul of all that's noble.... Can you fathom the loneliness of untold eons lived in darkness? My spirit was forged in that black fire....
You live alone because you are loathsome! The contagion of your wicked heart demands isolation.
Nay, mistress. I've found my mate and you know it. We're just alike, you and I. Beneath the skin we are already one.
Never!
'Twas your sin trapped the unicorn. Even now, the evil seed of what you've done blooms within you!
You lie! You're repulsive!
No more so than you! Can't you sense it? That is why I desire you. I need someone to share the dark secrets of my soul.
You....? You disgust me! You're nothing but a beast!
Everyone is a beast....only most are afraid to see it!
This mirror shows how we really are.... Behold your true reflection.
No! You're working magic on me! I won't believe it!
My Lady misjudges me... I am no common trickster.... look at you hands!
My mirror never lies.
Glory in your animal nature. It is your triumph!
I'm hideous!
No! The puling, pallid creature you were was truly something disgusting. Now you are magificent.... a fierce goddess!
Damn you!
We are both of us damned, my Queen.
Lili....? Can you hear me....?
....Lili....?
....Jack?
Over here.... By the door....
Oh, Jack....dear Jack! Can it really be you? I was afraid you were dead.
Thank God you're all right! I didn't know what to do.... I never want to lose you again....
Jack, my love....my precious love! I pray it's you and not more wicked magic.
It's me, you can be sure of that.... and there's magic on our side, too.
It's all my fault....the unicorn.... everything....
My fault as much as yours.... Don't worry. We're here to save you.
I'm far past saving, sweet Jack....
How did you do that?
I didn't do anything.... let me see your face. It will give me hope....
....just to glimpse your smile....
No.... I can't.... forget me, Jack....
Lili....? I love you....
Come, Jack. We've no time to spare.... Remember your plan?
Bride of Night.... Bride of Night.... Darkness is your heart's delight! Hail to Darkness! Hail the Night! His the Power and the Might! Master of Chaos, Lord of Doom, Sing his praises from the tomb!
I vote we run like hell!
Where were you? In another three flicks of a badger's tail it'll be half-past.
Sorry....time slips away when you're having so much fun.
We....found the mare ....chained....in the dungeon below.
Excellant.... Who has a bit of parchment?
Here.... I was saving it to write me will on.
Where there's a will there's a....
Shush, both of you....! Jack has a plan....a good one....
....angle of refraction equals.... angle of incidence....multiplied by a factor of fourty.....divided by the square root of a google-plex....
Perfect! It will work like a charm, Jack!
Let's get started! What we need to do is sneak back into the kitchen and gather all the plates and platters....
Oh no! Not me! Seen enough of that kitchen, I have!
Don't be so pig-headed! You can trust Gump.
I'd sooner trust a rat in the ghetto!
Well.... trust Jack then.
Remember....just the shiny ones....
....and be quiet! Soft as thistledown, that's the faerie way.
Get me outta here! Please! While I'm still medium rare!
Quiet....! You're a free imp on one condition....
Condition....! What condition? Loose me or I'll make such....
Any more noise and you're shish-ka-bob....
You do what we tell you.... understand?
Swear it!
I swear! On the festering forelock of Nicodemus!
A thousand thanks....
Up we go!
Your turn, Blunder.
Huh....! Wuzzat?
Meat....! Me smells fresh meat!
Find meat!
Over here!
Chop it up!
Smash....! Me smash!
Schweinhundt!
Gotcha!
Cut you in half!
Sweet, sweet blood....
Rooster toes....!
....pig whiskers!
Whut.....! Who now? Ouch!
Best you can do?
You gonna be mince-meat!
Got to catch me first!
Kill....! Smash....!
We must help Jack!
Stick him a good one!
Cut him down to size, Jack!
Gonna spill your guts, boy.
Wuzzat....?
Bad news!
Sodom and Glockamora!
Whoopeeeeeee!
Hate to break up the party, but there's work to be done!
Hurry! Get those plates~
Just a wee taste....
Move! Or I make your head ring worse than any hangover!
What's on your mind, Jack?
Smoke rising.... That chimney must go clear to the top.
Not much to hold onto. Take a peapod pixie to make the climb.
I'll do it!
What? Can I believe my ears?
Don't see why not. Ain't I small enough for the job?
No job's too small for the Buttercup brothers....
Be sure ya don't fall down!
All right! Do it! But be swift.
Thank you....thank you.... You'll never regret it....
I'm proud of you, Screwball.  Don't drop it....
We'll send Luna with a signal when all is ready.
Always knew you'd be going places, Screwball.... Good luck....!
I'm goin' places, all right.... straight to the top and on outta this hell-hole.... No more kitchen....no more demons.... Just the easy life for Screwball Buttercup....
Little more to the left, Luna.... that's better..just a touch more.... perfect.
How's that, Gump?
Dead centre....!
goblet fills mysteriously with black wine as she passes; every empty bowl and platter suddenly is heaped with an incredible things to eat-all of it black!
Good....eat....
The food is for your enjoyment.
I don't want it! I'm not hungry!
Do you lie just to please me?
I do nothing for your pleasure!
You are so like a child, milady. Sit, and we'll talk.
Like a child, you expect anger and defiance will upset me.... These are the qualities I admire most....
So.... I'd love to rip out your throat, yet it would pain you more if I licked your hand....
All I desire is that you sit in that chair and talk with me.
Sit....? Here....?
Yes. Please....
I prefer to stand.
Sit....!
 .....or stand. As you wish.... It's enough that we're alone together.... just the two of us....
MATCHING FIREPLACE OPPOSITE
All of time awaits us....why not make a start.
A start at what....?
Simple conversation....
What do we possibly have to talk about?
Thoughts....dreams.... ambitions....
I have no interest in your foul ambition.
Desire then....surely we beasts all have desire.
You'd never dream what I desire....
Don't be so sure.... Dreams are my speciality
It is through dreams I influence mankind. I have dreams of my own.... dreams of enternity with you....no more silence....no more loneliness....
Such drivel! You sound like some simpering schoolboy!
I'll wager there was a time when the attention of a devoted schoolbvoy were entirely to your liking.
I know what I'd do with such meat now!
....all things change, lady. The pleasures of youth become the regrets of maturity....
What're you doing here?
.....am I early....?
You impudent imp!
I thought the invitation said half-past....
GET OUT!
Sit.... I value your thoughts. Why not share them with me?
No more than that....just sit?
Sit....
Doesn't seem such an outrageous request....
You'll never regret granting me this favour....
What shall we talk about?
Just sit!
Such a disagreeable chair....must be terribly uncomfortable. I think I'll stand if you don't mind.
I prefer you to sit!
I'd rather stand, thank you.
Sit!
No.... Not now....
I command you to sit!
Don't be silly.
SIT, DAMN YOU!
Never.... never....
Jack....!
....I'm all right....Let's get on....to the dungeon....
You have power within I never imagined.
I'm not above my own little pranks, milady.... Should you have a taste for them.
No doubt they're as foul as the stuff you set on your table....
Foul....or fair, such distinctions are entirely arbitrary, my dear.... Does not the lowly toad think his mate fair, warts and all....?
Do you suggest I will think you fair some day?
In time....and time we surely have... stretching before us.... infinity....like a merciful curtain closing off the past....
I beseech you...do not reject my foods as you do my food.... Never have I abased myself so before another....It is not humility that brings me low, mistress.... but love....
Love?
Aye, love.... You think my heart a barren desert where only hate can flower....A much finer blossom show its petals now....nourished by sorrow....watered with your tears...  I offer you this rose, Princess! ....my heart....my soul....
You dizzy me, lord.... I never thought to hear the word 'love' spoken again....
You'll hear it forever.  I love you!
If such is true....hope is yet alive...  These talons can caress as well as kill....
It grows late....
Our wedding feast is in good voice....Think you not?
I admire your thrift, my lord, both the meal and entertainment in a single dish.
Are you anxious to see blood flow?
As you are to drink it!  Will the groom grant his bride her wish on this night?
I want to kill the unicorn!
Lady, you make me proud....
I will do it with joy....! Let the unicorn's blood anoint our love!
Crumpets and candlesticks....! She's gonna kill it!
....and in the eternity awaiting us, I will happily sit on your throne as befits the Queen of Darkness!
I can't let that happen....Why, it's not civilized!
Billygoat dumplings!
....not much time....
Bring me to the wretched beast.
This way, fair beauty. I hear a throat begging to be cut.
No....! It's impossible!
Now you are my queen. Nothing is impossible....Come....it takes but a single step....Find the faith....
Everything's ready....
And you, Jack? Your greatest challenge is still to come....
....oh, God....! Lili....
Judge her with your heart, not your eyes.
Greetings....
S-s-s-salutations....
Silence....! Prepare the unicorn for sacrafice!
The game is lost....for all of Jack's pretty plan... JACK No! It'll work! It must!
Luna! Fly up to Screwball! Tell him it's time!
Excellent.... Let the ritual begin....
In the beginning, there was nothing....a void of darkness, a cold enternity of silence....
Endless night, black as death! Mother of Shadows protect us!
Dream Sister....eclipse our pain!
....and when the perfect void was corrupted by Light, a great wailing was heard and all the brethern fled in terror....
Hear me, ye Powers of the Night! We offer this sacrafive in honour of you....
Here is our offering.... sanctified with blood....
....and with fire!
I pray you, Father, accept my sacrafice....Let Light be orever extinguished! Let the Age of Darkness begin!
....fiddle- dee-widdle-dee....
Screwball!
Do it!
Screwball...wake up!
Oh, Screwball....
Once your hands were too delicate for such a task....spinning and weaving were more their work....
Let my loom be made of flesh and blood.... I am sister to the Fates!
What a queen you'll make!
Come on, Screwball....
She means to do it, Jack! She's one of them!
I'm going to stop her!
Gump, wait! I trust her!
My lady, the birth of a new world awaits your stroke.
No....! Don't...!
I trust her, Gump....I'll always trust her....
Foolish, mortal!
Stop lads....! The light!
Run! You're free....!
Innocence!
Burn....! You evil bastard....
....and we'll dance on the black devil's grave....
LOOKING UP The beam of LIGHT dims and goes out.
What's wrong....? What's happening, Gump?
Sunset....
No, Jack....Quick! He's after the mare!
The world needs a champion!  Use this against him!
The black hooves of Darkness as he runs relentlessly along the unicorn's track.
Darkness....! You rotten filth!
Always a pleasure to take a brave man's life.
....haven't killed me yet....
....Oh, but I have...
Don't you know me, boy, don't you know from whence I come....
Time to die....
So...! I should have known....We're just the same! You're immortal, Jack!
No....! I'm not! I'm human....
Who was your mother?
I....don't know....
Who was your father?
....I....can't remember....
How long have you lived in the forest?
All my life....! I...I.... know who I am....
You pitiful fool! An immortal all this time and never knew....  Don't you see, Jack? Don't you understand your power....! Together we could rule the universe!
.....together....?
There'd be nothing to stop us! No power could stand in our way! We're just the same, Jack....You and I..... eternal....!
....Father....! Protect me....
Why....Jack....solved your riddle at last....
Should've known no mortal could speak unicorn like that....
How is Lili?
Sadly beyond the help of faerie magic. She's under a powerful spell.... It's like a riddle....
I know the answer....! Lift her to me, gently....
We'll meet again, dear friends....
Ride like the wind, Jack....
Wish we could go with him....
And why not? I know some magic words that'll do the trick!
Oh no! Not me! I hate to travel like that....makes me sick.
Stand back....! The sky's the limit!
Can't stand your bumpy takeoffs....
Screwball! Wait for the spell....
....I never do....
Eiderdown and milkfeed fluff....
Ow!
Ouch!
Home again!
Oh....! Jack! What a dream I've had!
Such a terrible dream.... I could never tell you....
Jack....? Where are you....?  Green Jack!
Jack....! Where are you hiding now?
I'm everywhere, Lili....my spirit lives in everything....
Jack.... Don't play games with me! I love you!
I....love.....you...
Will you be here tomorrow?
I'm always here, Lili.... whenever you come....
