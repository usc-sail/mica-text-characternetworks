 Your daughter's here, Mr. Wynant. (then, as Wynant doesn't seem to hear him, he speaks louder) Mr. Wynant!
I'm sorry...  but...
 Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I just wanted to tell you...
 I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
It's a good thing I'm going away -- no peace -- no quiet.  Everybody interrupting me --
Can we come in?
Did you tell him?
Sorry, Miss Wynant.  He didn't give me a chance.
Dad!
Why didn't they tell me you were here?
I'm sorry to interrupt your work, but this is important.
How are you?
 Another young man.
It's the same one.
 It's been the same one for three months.
Forgive me. (he shakes Andrew's hand) How are you?
Take a good look at him, Dad. (Wynant looks at Andrew and smiles) Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
 Well!
 That is, if it's all right with you.
And if it isn't?
 He'll still be your son-in-law!
 You see how much we have to say.
 Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
Mind if I look around?
Help yourself. (he turns and calls off) Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... (he stops as he sees Tom is ready to leave)
Where are you going?
 Home!
Home?
I'm fired.
 Who fired you?
You did.
Oh, forget it -- forget it.  Here ...  show this gentleman around...
Right this way, sir.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
 Yes, she would.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
 What would your mother say to that?
 This is my wedding.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
 He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
 If you think it'll be all right.
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
Where are you going?
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
A new invention?
Yes. (then significantly, and with measured tone) And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
 We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
 It's a promise?
That's one thing I won't forget. (he looks at his watch) Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
How's your brother?
 He's all right.
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
 You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
 I know -- I know --
 You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
Like all the rest of us. (he leans closer to Dorothy, speaking humorously) Has this fellow... (he indicates Andrew with a nod of his head) ...has he seen the whole family?
 And he still wants to marry me!
He's a brave man.
 I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
EMPTY_LINE
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Better get home before it is.
 Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
 Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
 I'll do my best.
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
 Oh. (he turns to Dorothy, smiling) I'll do my own typing!
 Quick! -- Here's a cab.
Hello, there, Mr. Macaulay.
How are you? (then as the snow pelts down, he starts to hold his umbrella over her) Here.  Get under this.
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
 Is your father still in there?
He's waiting for you.
Did he tell you where he was going?
He wouldn't say.
Tch-tch-tch -- (shutting the cab door) Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant. (then speaking to the driver as the driver is giving him his change) You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.
 That's okay -- I took it!
Mr. Wynant...  Mr. Wynant!
Hello, there! Come on up with me.
Did you get my money?
 I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
I'm not telling anyone.
 But suppose some business comes up...
That's just why I'm going.
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
 Never mind.
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
 I trust you.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
No.
 Well, let me do that for you.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for... (he stops suddenly as he looks at Macaulay and sees the eager look in his eye -- realizes that he is about to give himself away) No, you don't!
Thanks, and goodbye.
What'll I do if something comes up?
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
Is Julia going with you?
No.
But what if you need more money?
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
 You don't tell me a thing.  I don't know where you're going.  I don't know when you're coming back.  I don't know how to reach you if any business turns up...!
 My daughter's going to be married, Tanner.  Nice young man.  She just brought him.
Well, congratulations.
 I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to... (by this time Wynant has pulled out a box and is puzzled to see it empty) That's funny.... (he leans down and hunts through the different papers in the safe.  He doesn't find what he wants.  He turns to Tanner) Where are those bonds?
Bonds, sir?
I know I left them there.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
 Maybe she has.
 It's at the Grand Central.
 Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
How do you want it?
Straight. (turning a page of Vogue -- holding it up to the light. Through the transparent page, the corsets show through under the evening gowns) Do women really wear them things?
You're in the wrong place, mister.
 Am I?
What's on your mind? What do you want?
Who is it, Joe?
 That's what I want to know.
We're just having a little drink.
 So I see.
 See you later, Joe.
Sorry.  I didn't know I was talking to the boy friend.  S'long.
Who's that man?
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
I don't like him.
 What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
 What bonds?
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
 Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
 I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Don't you remember....
 Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
 Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
 What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
 That's my business.
 supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
 I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
 Go ahead!
 They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
 That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
 Hello ....  give me .... (Julia grabs the telephone from him, in a fury. She puts it down. Puts the receiver in place.  They stand facing each other) Well ....  ?
 I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
 You're going to return every cent of it!
 I can't! I haven't got it!
 What did you do with the rest?
I never had it.
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it? (Julia makes a move to answer the phone which rings again insistently) I'll answer that -- (he picks up the phone) Hello ...  hello ...
Hello ...  hello ...  hello ... HELLO ....
You don't need to tell me.  I have a pretty good idea.
What are you going to do?
 Cheer up, darling.
I'm sorry.
 Here's to us!
By this time next year, we'll be two old married people ...  trimming the tree ...  hanging up the stockings for the children ... (then as she looks up) ...  well, the child, then.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
 It's all right.
 Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
 But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry.... (then as he half rises, he continues) What is it?
Just a minute...
 Another Martini --
Hello, there!
 Hello! (then over his shoulder to the bartender) Make it two!  How are you?
You know, we know each other.
 Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
 Aren't you Nick Charles?
 Yes.
You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
Not that scrawny little....? (he puts out his hand as if measuring a little girl's height)
 Yes.
How did you ever remember me?
 was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Probably not.
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
 Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Disappeared!
 Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.
 I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
 I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
Macaulay.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
tried him once -
Why don't you try him again?
 Here's a nickle.
She's got me worrying, too.
 Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
 Why did that man want to kill him?
Said he stole his invention.
Do you suppose.....  ?
 What?
 Nothing.
You better take a drink.
Asta! Where are you going? Asta!
Madame, you can't bring that dog in here!
I'm not bringing him.  He's bringing me!  Asta!  Asta!
But Madame...  dogs aren't allowed.... It isn't only your dog...  but if we started.... Madame, you dropped your package.... etc.
So it's you he was after!
Hello, baby.
 He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
 I had him out this morning.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
 Oh, this is Andy --
How're you, Andy?  I don't usually look this way, but I've been Christmas shopping.
Madame, I'm afraid you'll have to....
 It's all right, Joe.  It's my dog... (and as an afterthought, waving his hand at Nora) ....and my wife.
You might have mentioned me first.
 He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
He might bite someone.
He's all right. (He puts Asta down on the floor. He speaks to the dog) Now lie down. (Asta looks up at him, wagging his tail, but making no move to obey him.  Nick speaks with more authority) Lie down! (still Asta looks fondly up at him, without obeying) Well then, stand up! (then triumphantly to Joe) See?
Any luck?
He's just around the corner.
Your father?
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
Oh, my wife -- Dorothy Wynant.
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Pretty girl.
If you like 'em like that.
 You got types?
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Who is she?
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
By the way, how is your father's side?
Much better, thanks.
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis.
 Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
What hit me?
 That last Martini.
 I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Take it easy.
Who's that?
 Santa Claus.
How are you?
 Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
 Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing. (Nick pours himself a drink as Macaulay sits down) I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
Mimi? (for a minute he doesn't realize who Mimi is) ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er - (he hints for the word) --sleuthing for her.
I haven't been a detective for four years.
You don't say --
 My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
I see.  I see.
 What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
No word at all?
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.
So that's still on? (he picks up the phone)
 Hello....  just a minute.
It's for you. (Macaulay gets up and starts for the phone) Your office.
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house? (she looks over and sees Macaulay at the phone) Oh, it's you.
 Yes?
My wife.
 How do you do? (he turns hastily back to the telephone. Nora walks out of the scene, toward the Xmas tree) What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well. (he hangs up and turns to Nick) He's back in town.... (then as Nick looks mystified, he adds:) Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now. (then realizing that Nora doesn't know what he is talking about) Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off. (he starts for the door, which Nick opens for him) Goodbye....  Goodbye,
S'long.
 Merry Christmas!
If anyone says "Merry Christmas" once more, I'll kill 'em.
I'm going to telephone that poor kid. (he searches in the directory for a number) At least she'll be glad to know he's alive.
Shall I use this....  or this? (she looks down at Asta, who is out of sight.  She speaks sharply) Asta! Asta! (she returns to her trimming, muttering indignantly) Our nice Christmas tree.
May I speak to Dorothy ----
 Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
 Give it to me.
 Oh, here she is.
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
 Oh, thank heaven.
 What is it? Has he found him?
 Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
What is it?
Nothing.
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
No.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
 I'll tell you.
 You've been listening again on that extension.
 Of course.  What's an extension for?
 What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
That woman!
She could tell you where father is.
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
 Shush!
Chris!
 You've hurt his feelings!
You know, you have an Oedipus complex and you won't admit it.
 Oh, please, Gilbert!
The trouble with you is that you won't face facts.  I know I have a mother fixation...  but it's slight......  it hasn't yet reached the point of...
Oh stop it!  Stop it!
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
 I'll get some.
You've said that for weeks.
I know.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
 Chris!
All right.  All right.
I couldn't go near that woman.
I said all right!
What are you going to do?
 Just what I said I'd do.
 You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
 Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Chris -- Chris -- !
Chris!
 Miss Wolfe?  Well this is Mrs. Jorgensen...  I wonder if I may see you?
 Why yes ....  yes.....
What is Miss Wolfe's apartment number?
Nine A.
Who shall I say?
 Miss Wolf expects me.
 Quick! Quick! Send somebody up here right away.  Something terrible has happened!
The way these dames get by with things makes me sick.
Yeah? -- Julia Wolfe, 145 West 55. (as he hears the address he writes it down)
 That's me.
 Here you are.
What is it?
A dame -- murdered.
That's more like it.
Telephone, Mr. Macaulay.
 Who is it?
The police.
Hello... (then with an awed surprise) Murdered! ...  Yes, yes, I'll be right over.
Where you been?
Out making some money.
 Let's see it.
I haven't got it yet.
All right, girls.
How'yer, Studsy.
 Diden you know Julia Wolfe?
 Yeah.
Somebody just bumped her off  I thought you'd like to know.
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
 Seen any signs of it, Bill?
Nope.
 Perhaps it was a robbery.
And her with that sparkler on her hand, and thirty dollars in her purse?  Looks to me like our friend Wynant came to collect and ran into a little trouble.
They say downstairs they haven't seen him in three months.
 There's a lot of things they don't see in this place. (he turns back to Macaulay) And you say you haven't seen him or heard from him in that time?
 I said he hadn't written me.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
 Well....
 Well, what?
He telephoned me today.
 He did!
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
When was that?
About three.
Did you go?
Yes.  But he didn't show up.
 His house and his shop is closed. And he ain't at any hotel.
 You're not going to stop at that, are you?
 No, sir.
 I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
 Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
 I didn't know they had a fight.
 Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
Mr. Guild, here's something very interesting...
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
 I thought you said you weren't going there.
 Why, you said...
 Never mind.
 Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
 Not a thing.
Was there much blood?
 Don't.  It's horrible.
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
 Did you kill her?
Gilbert!
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
The police.  I thought you said they'd finished with you.
They said they'd finished for the present.
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
 Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
 I'll go.
I'll be in my room.
Is Mrs. Jorgensen in?
 Yes, come right in!
 There are a few things we want to check up on.
I see.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Why yes.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
No.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
 I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
 And we just found out she had a thousand dollars the night before.
I'm sorry I can't help you.
That's all right. (slight pause -- His eyes swiftly scrutinize the group) Well, we'll be going.
 Goodbye.
 Goodbye.
Could I go down and see the body? I've never seen a dead body.
 Why do you want to?
 I've been studying psychopathic criminology.  I have a theory. Perhaps this as the work of a sadist or a paranoiac.  If I saw it, I might be able to tell.
 Come on, Bill.
What have you got there?
 None of your business.
You took that money from Julia's hand.
I didn't.
Then what are you hiding?
 It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
 You hand that over to the police.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
 I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
 I don't believe it! You're lying!
 There!
 Oh!
 Now do you believe me!
 How are you doing?
 Who are they, Nick?
 All my old friends.
Hey, Nick.  I think your wife's great.
Thanks.  I wanted you to see her... and I wanted her to see you.
 It's like old times, Nick.  Remember the fun we used to have when we were both flat broke?
Do I!
 Those were the good old days.
Don't kid yourself.  These are the good old days.
Nick Charles here?
Yes.  Nick!
You his wife?
Yes.
 Hey, Nick!
Hello, Face!
A long time.
Well, I needed the rest.
 Was he a good detective?
I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right.
 Come on.  Have a drink.
 I know.  But it's all right. They're his friends,
Like to buy a piece of this pug, Nick? I'll sell you twenty-five percent of him for five grand.
Is he good?
He's been knocking 'em cold.  He ain't afraid of nobody. (the fighter reaches for a drink.  The manager turns on him fiercely) Drop that, or I'll slug you.
 Here you are -- it's good stuff -- I got it before repeal.
Look, Nick.  Remember?  These are the ones you got back for me.
Them real?
 Ugh-ugh!  This is your night off.
--32 degrees below in Utica.  Here's the latest news of the Julia Wolf murder. (Nick turns as he tears this.  The CAMERA TRACKS with him as he goes toward the radio. The police captain is listening there...  he is the one who has changed the station) The police have found out that the beautiful blonde secretary was once a gangster's girl.  They are now looking for the gangster. Clyde Wynant, the girl's employer is still missing.  This case will.... (By this time, Nick reaches the radio. He abruptly turns the switch, changing back to a musical program.)
 Can't you fellows ever forget business?
Good case for you, Nick.
 Haven't you heard the news?  I'm a gentleman now.
Nick!  Reporters!
I'm from the American, Mr. Charles.
Mirror.
We wanted to know if you'd give us a statement.  We hear you're here to work on the Julia Wolf case.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
Come on, gimme a break.
I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth.
 My wife's on a bender.  I'm trying to sober her up.
 Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
We need ice.
 What small glasses you have, Grandma.
 Listen, isn't he working on a case?
Sure.  He's working on a case of Scotch.  Pitch in and help him.
 Isn't she grand?  I take off my hat to her.
 Your hat!  You're getting conservative!
I'd better order some food. (to Nick - as she takes receiver) That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
 Room service, please -
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
 I don't want to hear anything about it.
Isn't that my drink?
What are you drinking?
Rye.
Yeah -- that's yours.
 Listen - I want a whole flock or sandwiches --
 I'd like to telephone my mother... wish her a Merry Christmas.
 Go ahead, Foster.
'Fraid I can't pay --
Forget it.
 Long distance -- give me San Francisco --
Come on in.
I've got to see you alone!
Hello, beautiful!
 Go on in there.
Who's the little blonde?
Used to bounce it on my knee.
Which knee?  Could I touch it?
 House detective!
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Yes.
EMPTY_LINE
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
 Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
 Where did you hit her?
 Why... in the heart.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
She fell down.
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
 I don't know.
Which way did she fall?
She... she fell over backwards.
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
Where did you get this gun?
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Don't lie to me.
That's the truth.
This is awful of me -- to make a nuisance of myself.
 Don't be a dope.  Have a drink?
No thanks.
 There's powder and stuff over there.
 Make her take that.
Where did you get that?
 She brought it in. (slips it into the drawer of a table) Trying to make me believe she did it.
 What are you going to do with it?
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with. (he starts for the door to the living room) Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
Isn't that Dorothy Wynant?
Yes. (the first reporter makes a move to go past Nick to the bedroom, Nick bars the way) Here...here.  She doesn't know anything about it.
And you said you weren't on the case.
I'm not.  I don't know a thing about it, and I don't care a thing about it.  All I want is a drink.
 Hello, Ma.
Give me that.
 But I just got San Francisco ...  How are you, Ma?
 Give me Drydock 4 - 8000.
 Now don't tell your paper that I'm working on anything, 'cause I'm not.
He's just working on that little gal.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Hello, Mimi.
want to talk to you about something very important.
Come on in here.
Sorry.  This is the only place we can be alone; Won't you sit down?
How do you do, Mr. Wynant. (he takes Gilbert cordially but firmly by the arm and brings him into the room) My name is Diamond. Come on in and have a drink.
I don't drink.
As a matter-of-fact, I don't either. I'd much rather talk...
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
What do you think?
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
 Well, don't you?
 You're always teasing.
I beg your pardon.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
 But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it. (he goes and opens the door which connects with the bedroom) Now you take Dorothy home and...
 Dorothy!  Is she here?
 Yes...
If you finish this, you'll feel better.
What did you tell him?  What did you tell him?
She didn't tell me a thing.
 Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
 I'm so excited I didn't know what I was doing.  Come on, Dorothy, we'll go home.
 She'll go home if she wants to. (she turns with warm affection to Dorothy) You can stay here you know.  There's plenty of room and we'd love to have you.
Thanks.  But I'll go home.
Where's Gilbert?
 We might as well be living in the lobby.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
 He was?
Yes.  He admitted it.
 Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
Why not?
You know how they are... sex...
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Is that what it means?
Of course.
 Come on, son.
Come on.... give me a break.  You owe it to me after that.
I swear I haven't a thing to do with it. (He picks up the telephone.  The 2nd reporter listens, unashamed) Hello?
Mr. Charles, I'd like to lay a proposition before you.  I can't discuss it over the telephone, but if you'll give me half an hour of your time... it's about the Julia Wolf....
 Hello... hello...
What was it?
Just a man trying to sell me insurance.
Where's that girl?
She's gone.
How'd they go?
Out the back way.
I love you, Nickie, 'cause you know such lovely people!
 Nick!  Nick! (he looks sleepily at her) Are you asleep?
Yes.
Good. I want to talk to you.
That's jolly.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
Can't you get to sleep?
No.
 Maybe a drink would help you.
No thanks.
Maybe it would if I took it.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
 They were kidding you.
I'd like to see you work.
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
 There's nothing I can do to help her.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
 Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
I think I would like that drink. (Nick gets up again and goes to get her a drink) I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
 At breakfast.
But it's Christmas now.
 Breakfast.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
Did you hear a knock?
Mr. Charles here?
Yes.
 I gotta talk to him... that's all. But I gotta do that.
You wait here.  I'll tell him.
Nick!  Nick! (Nick stirs and opens his eyes) There's someone to she you,
 That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
You've got the funniest look on your face.
I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
 You idiot! (Asta begins barking at Morelli) Asta! Stop that!  Get down! (she chases him off the bed.  Asta jumps down out of sight. Morelli still has his pistol pointed at Nick.) Now, stay there.
 I mean... what's on your mind?
You don't need to tell me you're tough.  I heard about you. (He puts the gun in his overcoat pocket) I'm Joe Morelli.
I've never heard about you.
I didn't knock Julia off.
All right - you didn't.
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
Why tell me?
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
 Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
 How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
 He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
 That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
I am on the level. If I knew anything I'd....
 What's that?
 This is your party.
Open up.  Police.
 You two-timing --
Nora.....Nora!
I did. She was in the line of fire. (turns, points to liquor bottle) Hand me that bottle. (turns back to Nora, begins working on her) Better get a doctor.
 You darn fool -- you didn't have to knock me out.  I knew you'd take him, but I wanted to see you do it!
There's a gal with hair on her chest.
 Nick... you're...
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
Someone get a doctor.
There's one coming.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
 Sure -- I don't even feel it.
I'll get some towels. (she goes quickly into the bathroom)
Well, it was close, but you're all right.
Tough luck.
Shut up!
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
Want a drink?
Yeah.
 How'd you people happen to pop in?
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
 Yes.  I might not have been shot.
We were looking for this bird.
That little rat Nunheim --
Shut up! (then to Nick - indicating Morelli) This guy a friend of yours?
I never saw him before.
What's he want of you?
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
What's that to you?
Nothing.
What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him.  I don't know.
I'm asking you.
Keep on asking.
Not without a warrant.
So you say -  Go on, Bob.
Listen, Mr. Charles.  I guess we're both of us going about this wrong. I don't want to get tough with you, and I guess you don't want to get tough with me.
That's another one I can't answer right now. Maybe it was an accident.
 What's that man doing in my drawers?
Here you are, Lieutenant.
Have you got a pistol permit?
No.
Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?
 That's all right.  We're married.
This gun yours?
No.
Who's is it?
I'll have to try to remember.
Okay.  There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better. (He turns to the officers and Morelli) Come on.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
 You're a fine watch dog.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Well, didn't you?
 This is the nicest present I ever had.
I never saw that before.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Who gave it to you?
You did.
You must admit I have good taste.
 Finished with these?
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids. (he takes aim again with his gun) That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
 Hello... send him up.
Who's that?
Macaulay.
 Season's Greetings.  The Mallorys. (she hands it to Nick. She is distressed) I forgot all about them.
Aren't you hot in that?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty. (she hands him another telegram) The Kirbys.
 Is that another Christmas present?
 Yes.
Did I give it to you?
Yes.
I'm spoiling you.
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant! (Nick puts down his rifle, all attention.  Nora reads it aloud) "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
 Let's see.  Where's it from?
 Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
 I don't know.
 He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Good.
How are you?
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
That's all right.
Asta!  Asta!  Come here.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
That's all right.
What a delightful toy.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
So did we. (correcting herself - indicating Nick) I mean, Sherlock here.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
Slim.
Oh, please, Nick.
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
It might.
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
 Hello.... oh, just a minute. (holding out the phone to Macaulay) Police department?
 I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  That looks like an admission of guilt.  And I had such hopes.  I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....  Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
Well, that's that. (Nick starts to get up off the sofa) Stay there, Nick!
 It's not going to hurt me to get up.
 Sit down!
 You talk as if I were Asta.
All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
 What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
 What's the matter with you?
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
 Maybe I will.
 But Wynant --- ?
I don't believe he did it.
Why don't you?
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out. (he starts to untie his robe) I'm tired of being pushed around.
 So am I.
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
 Good morning --
Good morning, Lieutenant - (Asta pulls her violently toward the curb. She goes after him, out of the scene, calling back apologetically) Sorry.
 You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
You mean about that gun?
That ain't a gun any more.  The firing pin's busted - the -  Don't waste time talking about that.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
Man to man, I'm not.
But he's interested!
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
So would I.
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
What about the suicide?
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
You've been there?
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
No proof?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What do you mean?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
Who's your candidate?
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
What about Jorgensen?
I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
Dull... I'm sitting on the edge of my chair!
What about this Nunheim?
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
No.
He's holding out on you.
 Taxi!
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
Catch me letting you go alone!
 Grant's Tomb.
Who is it?
John.
I wasn't expecting you, Lieutenant. You said you'd phone.
 Sit down.
Have a shot?
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth. (Marian laughs once, derisively. But there is no mirth in her face. Nunheim twists around to face her) All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
Is that so!
Cut it out.  We didn't come here to watch you two rough-house.
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
 That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
 Want to take a poke at him?
 I didn't mean you, Mister.
Come on, now -- she can't hear you -
Well... (looking toward the door of the bedroom) You know how it is. A guy knocking around....
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
 You don't think I had anything to do with it?
Where were you?
Marian!
I don't like crooks and even if I did, I wouldn't like crooks that are stool pigeons, and if I did like crooks that are stool pigeons, I still wouldn't like you.
Where were you?
Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
 Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
Just give me a minute....  I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant.  You know I always come clean with you. (he has his head in his hands trying to remember. Guild looks at Nick and winks.  Nunheim looks up, relieved. He snaps his fingers) Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me...  that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!
Well, what'd you think?
I think we're on the right track.
Who're you calling?
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Trail him!  Trail who?
Nunheim!
 Bill, tell the boys to pick up Nunheim.   He just left here - went out the fire escape (then, as Bill evidently laughs, Guild speaks with hurt dignity) What's funny about that? (he hangs up and looks sheepishly over towards Nick.)
Listen.  They been questionin' me again.  Asking me what more I know. Where I was that day....  Wait a minute.  I ducked out on 'em.  Now if you want me to play dumb, I want fi' thousand more...  Fi' grand and I'll skip town today.... Where?  O.K... Right away... See that you're there and have it with you.
 "Arthur Nunheim -- Honorary member"
Not a thing.
 Find out about that bullet yet?
And how are your folks?
 How are you?  -- No, we didn't get a thing. (He hands the phone to Nick) It's your wife.
Well, I've got something, Lieutenant.  I've been doing a little detective work of my own. That flat foot I married thinks he's smart -- but I'm one jump ahead of him.
 Um?
 Do you hear me?
 How's Grant's tomb?
It's lovely.  I'm having a copy made for you --
What have you got?
Can't hear you -- little lou -- (an alert look comes into his eyes as he listens closer, getting what she is saying.  Guild, too, is interested.) We'll be right up! (Nick puts down the phone and turns to Guild) She's up at Mimi's.  Jorgensen has disappeared.
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
 But he has nothing to do with it!
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this -- (he picks up a picture of Jorgensen from the bureau) The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
They'll want more than your word for that.
 All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
 Mother!
 And I'll give then proof!
 Dorry!
Oh, Andy.
Don't cry.
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
 Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
 I can't.
You've got to get your mind off this.
 You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Go!
And don't ever try to see me again.
What are you talking about?
 Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
Do you think I care
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Dorothy!
 How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
You're talking like a crazy person,
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
Go away!
Go away!
Sleuthing isn't all fun, is it?  I feel so sorry for that poor girl -
Get anything?
She's ready to talk. (he hands Guild Jorgensen's photograph) It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
You know, you're wrong about all of your children being murderers... I've studied the Mendelian Law of inheritance and their experiments with sweet peas, and according to their findings... and they've been pretty conclusive... only one out of four of your children will be a murderer.  So the thing for you to do would be to have just three children... (then as a thought comes to him) ... no, no.  That might not work The first one might be the bad one.  I'll have to look that up.
You needn't look it up.  I'm not going to get married and I'm not going to have any children.  From now on, I'm just out for the ride!
 I wanted to protect him.
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
This is enough for me.
Calling all cars - calling all cars - cover all
"Extra -- extra -- Wynant wanted in second murder --" "Five Star Final" -- Wynant's ex- wife produces murder evidence -- " "Extra - extra -- double murder charge against Wynant --"
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York.... (she stops short as CAMERA PULLS BACK and she sees Nick is in his overcoat, bending over Asta with a leash) Where do you think you're going?
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
He's just been for a walk.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
What's that? (she puts her hand in and pulls out a bunch of skeleton keys) What are you up to? (she puts her hand in and and pulls out a pistol - she unconsciously holds it, pointing at him) Nickie - what is this?
 Looks like a hold-up!
What are you going to do?
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
 Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
You bet I wouldn't.
Not with all your money!
You dog!
 Goodbye, darling.
 Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
 Sure I will.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
 Why, I believe the little woman cares.
I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all -- (Nick gives her an affectionate hug and a kiss. He calls to Asta. Nora turns to the dog, trying to hide her emotion under a pretense of clowning) If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
This is it.
 You don't want me to wait, do you?
No thanks. 
 Well .... good luck!
 Ready?  Well, let's go.
You keep quiet now. Come on.
 Well, come along, then...
 You're not a Scottish Terrier. You're a police dog.  New cement.
 Hello, Lieutenant Guild, please... John?  This is Charles.  I'm up in Wynant's shop.  Well, I've found something... it's a body.
Stick 'em up!
 Don't make a move or that dog will tear you to shreds!
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you. (then to Tanner, with a return of his brisk, professional tone) Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
No, Mr. Charles.
How did you get in here?
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
You worked here?
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
Trying to put it off on her?
Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles -- (he pulls out some bills) I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
 Police!
 You didn't know anything about all this?
No, sir....
 Take him down to the can.  I'll see him later.
 I wonder what Wynant had against this one?  Quick lime. Well at least the clothes weren't touched.
Mind if I take those out, Doc?
Go ahead.
 Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Extraordinarily lucky.
No - no identification - (he holds the coat up) Must have weighed two hundred and fifty if he weighed an ounce.
Here's something, Bob comes into the scene.  He hands Guild a walking stick.  Guild takes it and examines it.
 Rubber tip.  He must have been lame.
Who wouldn't be.... carrying that weight around.
 Standing straight he'd be about five foot, eleven, wouldn't he?
About.  There is a belt attached to the trousers -
 "D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
Rosebreen.
Could this be him?
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he? (he turns to the Doctor) How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?
I can't say offhand.  At least a couple of months...
Couple of months.  That's just when he closed the shop.  The way I figure it is... he kills this guy and plants him here.  Julia knows about it, so he kills her. And Nunheim caught him at that, so he he had to bump off Nunheim. (he makes a bundle of the clothes) Well, we'll be going along.  You done a swell job.  You wouldn't like to pay me that hundred now?
Wait 'till you catch Wynant.
You can take that out to the car.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Yes.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Not at all.
I'm very interested in that body.
Give my best to your wife.
 What're you doing here?
 I'll take care of him.
What do you think you are?
I'm a 'de-tect-uf'.
There's the bullet he was killed with.  See?
What's this?
Oh, just an old piece of shrapnel.
Shrapnel!
 Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
 Yes... yes.
 Now, Mr. Charles --
 Get that out of here.
Just one family group. Sob Sister It'd be lovely for the woman's page.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
No.
Do you think they'll I find him?
I know they will.
Got anything else to say about the case?
Yes.  It's put me way behind in my drinking.
What about this Rosebreen?
 Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
 Come on, let's get it in.  Thanks, Nick.
What's your next step, Nick?
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
We'll see you before you go.
 Back to California
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
 I did find him!
What do you mean?
 He was down in the shop.
Nick!
It was his body that was buried there.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
 Wynant's body?
 Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
 That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims. (he takes up telephone) Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Several things. (speaks into the telephone) Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
 Huh?
What things made you so sure?
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Well, don't they?
Sure.
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
 Gimme.
How long has he been dead?
Couple of months anyway.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Smart gal.
 Does Dorothy know?
No.  Nobody but you.
I'm going to tell her.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
 But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
Why not?
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
 Yes!
Got a nice evening dress?
 Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
 Got a nice evening dress?
I've got a lulu -- why?
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
The suspects!  They won't come.
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. (he starts to telephone)
Who do you think did it?
Mimi...
Mimi!
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 
you doing on the ninth of June?
 Shall I serve dinner now?
Just a minute -
 We got 'em.  Picked 'em up at the Pennsylvania Station. (he turns to the door) Come on in.
Hello, Dorothy. (Nick reaches out and takes her bag)
Hello, Nick! (she looks around the room) And a party - celebrating father's third murder - 
Dorothy!
And cocktails!
 Why the bags?
None of your business.
They were trying to make a get- away, Quinn (Drunk and belligerent) We were doing nothing of the sort. What's the idea of this?
Didn't he... (he indicates the detective) ...give you my invitation?
You can't get away with this.
You're perfectly right.  Take the gentleman's coat and bag.
 This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
You're high enough.
Why not?
You know, you interrupted me at a very important point in my life. I was about to take my first false step.  Come on, Quinny. Let's dance -
 I'm getting out of here.
No - I need you here.
 If I stay, I know I'll take a poke at him.
Then I insist that you stay.
I want some more of that tiger milk.
 I think somebody could do something with that girl if they took hold of her right.
 Yeah - by the throat!
I think we may as well sit down.
 I guess all the suspects are here.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
 You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
 Chris!
I'm Nick Charles. How do you do?
Chris, where have you been?
Sorry we're late.  But they had to break down the door.
 Won't you come in?
 Mr. Jorgensen, you sit next to Andrew, and Mrs.  Jorgensen on your right.
I'm Mrs. Jorgensen.
 Put it over there.  I was Mrs. Jorgensen before you were.
Mimi.... you're here on my right.
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
Yes.
I wish you'd tell me who.
I wish you'd tell me.
Quinn       Macaulay Dorothy     Tanner Gilbert     1st Mrs. Jorgensen Morelli     Jorgensen Marian      Andy
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
You did!
That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
You did... where?
 Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
 Oh, did he?  What did he say?
He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
 What kind of clothes was he wearing?
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
 Tell 'em.
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
know.  But I saw him -
 Where did you see him?
I was gazing in my crystal.
 Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
 Are you kidding?
No.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
 He didn't do it -- Nick!
 What do you mean?
Together.  Then who did?
Do you mean to say...?  Etc.
That's ridiculous.
Let him have his say out.
Morelli - (Morelli jumps, startled.  Everybody looks at him) You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
 She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Why do you say that?
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
 No... no.
You're going to drive me crazy!
 It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
 Dead?
He's been dead for three months.
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
 Oh, Andy, Andy!
 You'd better take her home.  Your home.
Come on, darling.
 If she's going wrong now, she's going wrong right.
I don't think we need you any more now.  I'm deeply sorry that I spoiled your trip.
Come on, everybody. Eat up. You're not eating.
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
You mean that body-----?
--was Wynant's.
Perfectly absurd.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
You're not going to pin this one on me.
 What am I?  The fall guy?
 I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
 It's the best diner I ever listened to -
You're not going to keep us in the dark, are you?  Tell us -- who is it?
I don't know. (There is more consternation at that) But I thought if we all had a little get-together we might be able to find out.  I'll tell you as much as I know.  Go right on eating. This murderer is a very clever. He studied this thing out very carefully.  You'd understand that, wouldn't you, Gilbert?
 What?  Yes - no -
He planned the whole thing beautifully. After he killed Wynant he wired Macaulay, using Wynant's name and told him to shut up the shop.  He destroyed all of Wynant's clothes, with the exception of his watch chain.  He figured that some day that might come in handy. Then he took Wynant's body and buried it in the shop with another man's clothes to throw us off the track.  He even put a belt buckle with an "R" on it, hoping that we'd think it was Rosebreen -- an old enemy of Wynant's who dropped out of sight years ago. (He looks over at Morelli) Morelli - would you mind holding your knife another way?  You're worrying Gilbert. (Morelli, who has been holding his knife as if it were a dagger, gives Gilbert a disdainful look, and shifts his knife)
 If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
 But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.
Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
 Is that true?
I don't know.
Why are you saying it?
It's the only way it makes sense.
I hope you're well.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over.... (with a look at Mimi) ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
 And I don't blame you.
 What do you say that to me for?
 Shut up.
 You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is. (everybody looks at Mimi) Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - (she starts to go - but stops to listen to Nick as he continues)
 Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
I have no right to answer that.
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen - (he speaks to the woman with Jorgensen) Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
No.
 So you see, Mimi, under the law, you haven't re-married.  You're still one of the heirs.  What are you holding out for?  A few crummy dollars that that man gave you when you can get the whole estate? Remember the other two who were in with him on this... Julia and Nunheim.  When he thought they might spill something he bumped them off.  You ought to know damn well that he's not going to take any chances on you. What do you want to do?  Be next on his list?
 You dirty son of a b----- !
What do you want me to do?  Wrap him in cellophane?
 To you two.
And to you two too.
Come!
Your room's ready, sir.
Thanks.  You can take Asta now.
 You're going to your nice little bed in the baggage car.
 Shall I keep them fresh for you?
Please, if you will.
Might as well set it ahead now.
Gracious!  One o'clock.  We'd better go.
Good night.
I can never thank you enough for all you've done.
 Forget it.
 Goodnight.  Goodnight.
 I thought they'd never leave.
 I thought you'd never leave.
 Asta -- meet Fifi --
