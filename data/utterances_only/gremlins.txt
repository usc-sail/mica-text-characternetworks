walks through the owd. An American businessman.1-He wears a tas eful g3,y suit. He's thin, with distinguished good looks and thin brown hair. He's 56 years old. Rand looks around; fascinated by the vast array of people and merchandise. He stops at a booth. A tiny ORIENTAL, WOMAN stands behind the counter. Rand gives her a polite smile.
Hi. I'm from out of town... on business from the U.S. The woman nods and smiles.
 I'm looking for a present... for my son. The woman nods. She searches through her wares. She holds up a basketball. Rand shakes his head.
He's not really involved in sports... The woman puts away the basketball. She picks up a Sony "Walkman". Rand again shakes his head.,
No. I want something unusual... something he can't get at home... something different..
reaches out and grabs Rand's arm. Startled, he turns. The Oriental man stands before him. He stares into Rand's eyes.
I can help you. He leads Rand away from the booth.
I offer something very different. Very unusual. Rand is puzzled. The Oriental leads him to a doorway.
Follow me. He opens the door, motioning for Rand to follow. Rand pauses, skeptical.
Come. Take a look. It will cost you nothing.  You won't be disappointed. The Oriental enters. Rand shrugs and follows.
Rand follows the man up a narrow, dark set of stairs. At the top, they enter a room.
A TINY CREATURE is inside'. The animal is eleven inches tall and stands; upright on two legs. It has two arms, with small; four-fingered hands. Its body is covered with fluffy brown fur. The piercing eyes are big, sad. Its ears are long and pointed. A tiny black nose sits above a wide mouth, with small, square teeth. The creature is smiling. It lets out a giggle. Rand is delighted and surprised. He's never seen anything like this. The animal is more charming than a Disney character. The Oriental claps his hands. The creature leaps from the box, onto Rand's shoulder. The animal licks Rand's cheek.' He laughs, amused by the creature. The Oriental claps his hands again. The creature hops back into the box. It stares at Rand with those cute green eyes'.
 What is it?
It is called ' Mogwai ' .  A very rare and intelligent animal. I found it in the fields near my home It will obey all orders. It learns fast. The Oriental looks at Mogwai and claps his hands.
(Chinese,; English
And if you are ever in need of a song... He claps his hands to the creature.
(Chinese; English
Music. Mogwai begins to hum, in an unearthly falsetto. It's beautiful. Rand watches with wide eyes. He feels like a child again.
How much?
One hundred American Dollars. Cash. Rand removes five twenties from his wallet. He gives them to the man. The Oriental smiles and claps his hands. Mogwai jumps onto Rand's shoulders. Rand pets it. Mogwai emits a cute giggle.
It never sleeps. It will eat any- thing... but prefers raw meat.
Your son will enjoy his new friend. Rand smiles and exits. The Oriental takes a bite from his raw fish.
Mogwai is inside of a small plastic pet box. The creature's bright eyes shine from inside.
 Yes, Fred. The Tai-Chan account is definite. MmmHmm. My plane l eaves in twenty minutes. See you in Pennsylvania. He hangs up. He picks up his bags and walks to the check- in counter.
Don't worry, sir. Your pet will be safe. Rand smiles.
What does it mean?
Devil. She moves to the next passenger. Rand stares. Surprised. Confused.
Crowded. Several peoplestandin line.

I can't cash this, M'am. Your last check hasn't cleared.

the bank's Vice President, walks over to Billy and Mrs. beagle. Roland is tall, slender with thin grey hair and a pencil thin moustache. Friendliness and courtesy are his job. He smiles at Mrs. Deagle.
What seems to be the problem, M'am?
My name is Mrs. Julia Deagle. This young teller is being very rude! I demand that you fire him!
Apologize to the woman, Billy. Billy leans to Roland.
 I. didn't do anything wrong.
 Just apologize. Roland.leans back and smiles at Mrs. Deagle. Billy looks at her. He doesn'-t want to do this. Everyone in the bank is watching him, waiting for him to take a stand. Billy sighs. He needs his job.
 I'm sorry, Mrs. Deagle. She nods and smiles. Roland puts his hand on the woman's shoulder.
Come back to my desk, Mrs. Deagle. I'll personally take care of your banking problems. Roland walks back to his office with Mrs. Deagle. Gary chuckles. Tracy goes back to work. Billy just sits. Angry. Humiliated. He calls the next customer.

Let me. He helps her on with the coat.
You look very pretty today.
I mean.. .not that you don't look pretty every day...But you look especially pretty today.
Let's go. I'm hungry.  Hey, Peltzer...Whydidn't you stand. up to that old bag, today?
What's this?
It's a book. You read 1t. Billy exchanges a smile with Tracy. Gary isn't amused.
I know that, asshole. I meant what's it about?
King Arthur. . .Sir Lancelot... Knights of the Round . Table... Dragons...
Aren't you a little old for that kinda' junk?
(gives Billy the
I'll take 'Monday Night Football' over this crap any day.  C'mon. Let's go. Tracy gives a wave to Billy. She and Gary walk away. Billy watches. He draws an imaginary sword from his side. He lifts the sword and lunges forward. At Gary. Billy sits at a table. Alone. He's reading his book. He eats, but his wide eyes never leave the page. He's fas- cinated by the story. Like a child. He gets to a funny section.. He laughs.
What a nut. Laughin' to himself. That's the kind of guy who'll shoot a president.
Yeah, and those are the guys who always crack. The real smart guys. 6ti He's gotta be a psycho. 26 years old, still lives with his parents. Doesn't have a girlfriend. He's always alone. Real weirdo. The others agree. Tracy doesn't. She likes Billy. Billy continues to read, totally caught up in his book. Totally caught up in his fantasy.
.And the snow keeps coming, folks. Looks like we're gonna have a White Christmas. Another three inches is expected tonight... Billy looks out of his side window and sees
walking home from school. Pete is 16 years old. A chunky, pleasant baby faced kid. With his bright orange down jacket, Pete resembles a tiny snowman. Suddenly, Pete.slips on the ice. Bam. Right on his ass. His school books scatter over the ground.
Pete...You okay? Pete nods. Billy helps him up. Pete brushes himself off. Billy is amused by the boy.
You want a ride home?
Thanks. That'd be nice. Billy helps Pete pick up his schoolbooks.

Lancelot raises Excalibur and... Wham! He knocks the Black Knight down ! Then with-another swing... Wham! He finishes him off!
 Wow... Billy digs into his pocket and gives Pete the copy of "Once And Future King".
Here. You can borrow it. Pete takes the book.
Hey, Billy...You know so much about Vikings and stuff...You should write one of these stories yourself.
Really?
Sounds gre t. When can I read it?
A huge, three story home, with an antique shop set up on the first floor. Billy and Pete get out of the car and enter the store.
the 64 year old storekeeper, stands behind the counter. Dorry is husky, bald on top, with thick patches of red hair on his temples. A huge, red moustache sits beneath his bulbous nose. His arms are thick, hairy. A strong Irish- man.
Good afternoon to you, Billy.
Hi, Dorry.  Is it ready yet? Dorry smiles. He reaches to a shelf behind the counter. He removes ,a long object, wrapped in a piece of green cloth. He rests it on the counter.
 It's an authentic replica of an Eleventh Century sword. Billy's eyes examine every inch of the sword. It's beautiful.
I got most of the rust off...But there were a couple spots that wouldn't budge. Billy runs his finger along the blade.
Careful. It's sharp. A big smile covers Billy's face.- He's in love with the sword.
What do I owe you?
Two hundred. You can pay me twenty a week. Billy pulls a twenty from his wallet and pays Dorry. Billy carefully wraps the sword and puts it under his arm.
Thanks, Dorry.
My pleasure, son. Billy and Pete exit the store.
a friendly Irish Setter, greets Billy. He pets the dog and hangs his coat in the hail- closet.
Billy's Mother. 53 years old. Slightly heavy. Well dressed. Styled brown hair. A pretty woman. She hears Billy enter. She quickly pops a valium from a small pill bottle. She calls to her son.
Billy? Is the'.t you honey?
sighs.He hates to be called "honey".
Dinner will be ready in ten minutes. Okay. He hurries upstairs w Iith
Billy sits at the table, eating dinner with Lynn.
How was work?
Okay.
Have you asked that Tracy girl out yet?
I was just curious.
Yeah,.well it's none of your business. Nervous,Lynn popsvalfum with her wine.
No. It isn't. I'm old enough to take care of that stuff myself. I'm old enough to get a place of my own.
Don't start that again. Your Father's coming home tonight.
Good. I think we should talk about it.
It'll put him in a bad mood.
No, it'll put you in a bad mood. Lynn and Billy exchange a glare. They look down at their food. A few silent, uncomfortable moments pass. Lynn looks back to Billy. She smiles. Time for the tender approach. She touches his hand.
Billy, honey...
 Stop calling me 'honey'.
Dad and I just don't want you to have to struggle like we did. We want to help, until you can support yourself as a writer.
Bit it's gonna take me another- year to finish my novel. . .and what if it doesn't get published?
It'll get published.
But what if it doesn't? Are you gonna take care of me until I'm old and grey, working on my 25th unpublished novel?...
If it takes that long, yes.
Is anybody home? Lynn stands and whispers to Billy.
Please, let's forget about this. Just for tonight. Okay? Billy pauses. Finally gives in and nods. Lynn stands. She pops another valium and exits to greet her husband. We hear them, exchange an excited ".hello". They kiss and laugh, glad to be in each other's arms. Billy just sits. Burning.
 Hi, Dad. They hold each other for a second. Lynn closes the front door. Rand picks up Mogwai's case. Lynn turn's to her husband.
 Not now. I've got a surprise for both of you. Come on. He leads them into the living room. Lynn and. Billy exchange a puzzled glance. They follow Rand.
Barney hates it. He growls at Mogwai.
 What is it? A.monkey? A rat?.
Your new pet.
What's that?
He's singing.
Sounds kind of creepy. Barney still growls.
Barney! Be a good dog and go up- stairs! Barney reluctantly hops off Billy's lap and exits. Lynn stares at Mogwai.
I think he's just darling. Mogwai. Rand holds the creature out to Billy.
Hold him.
 Maybe later.
C'mon. He won't bite. Billy forces himself to take the creature. Mogwai nestles close to Billy. Rand smiles at his son.
He likes you. Billy looks nauseous. Lynn stands.
You two look so cute together. I have to take a picture. Lynn walks to a nearby drawer, opens it and removes-a Kodak Instamatic. Mogwai is on Billy's shoulder, licking his cheek.. Billy hates it.
I want you to take good care of him. Lynn focuses the camera on Billy and Mogwai.
Okay smile. Billy forces a smile. Mogwai still licks his cheek. Lynn snaps the picture. Flash! Mogwai lets out a high scream. Frightened of the bright light, Mogwai jumps back, accidentally scratching Billy's cheek.
Little bastard. Mogwai scurries back to Rand. He pets the creature, comforting it
Settle down, Billy-There's no reason to get upset. The little fellow's scared. He hates bright light.. Billy shrugs. He wipes his fingers along the scratch on his face. He looks -at t em. There's blood on his4ingertips. Billy looks at Mogwai. The creature looks at Billy. It giggles.
Mogwai watches Billy. from the darkness of the book shelves. Above Billy., The creature begins to sing. Billy tries to ignore Mogwai's singing. No good. It gets on his nerves. Billy slams his hand on the desk top. He glares at the creature.
Shut up. Mogwai stops singing. Billy goes back to his writing. Mogwai.hops from the shelf. Staying out of the direct light, the creature moves across the desktop and cuddles up to Billy's arm. He jumps back.
Get off of me. Mogwai just looks at him.
Get.off`my desk. Billy shines the bright.desk light into the creature's eyes. Mogwai screams and jumps. off the desk, to the floor. Billy looks down at the creature.
Stay down there. Billy goes back to his work. Mogwai is-bored. The creature leaps up to the bed.. It sees the sword. Mogwai lifts one end, examining it. It's too heavy. The sword slips off the bed and falls to the floor. Billy turns. Mogwai takes a step back. Guilty. Frightened. Billy picks up the sword. The handle is chipped.
 You stupid little... Billy raises the sword over.Mogwai. He's ready to kill the tiny creature. Mogwai loo] .s up at Billy. The creature is shivering. It is frightened. It's big, green eyes are watery. Billy suddenly feels sympathetic. He lowers the sword and picks up the.creature.
It looks like the snow has stopped for awhile. But don't put away those ear muffs, more flurries are scheduled for tonight...
Starting work early today?
Oh, hi. Well, I thought the roads would be icy.
We've got a half hour before work. Wanna go have a cup of coffee? She.pauses and smiles.
.and if I sell the novel, I'll be able to quit the bank.
I'd love to quit. I'd run straight to the airport and buy a one way ticket to Paris.
Why Paris?
I've only seen it in movies and T.V... . But it seems like it's got everything that this town doesn't...Museums...great restaur ants... Beautiful artworks and architecture...  Listen to me, talking like I've been there 10 times. I shouldn't get so carried away. It's only a dream.
Hey...Don't give up on your dreams. They just might come true. Tracy shrugs and takes a sip of coffee.
Can I ask you a personal question?  What is it with you and Gary? Is he your boyfriend?
He thinks he is.
Do you think he is?
No. I think of him more as a friend. But he thinks of me as a lot more.
So there's a possibility...I mean... I.just might have a chance with you?
, Don't give up on your dreams. They just might come true. They both laugh.
Hello? Is anybody home?
Want some?
I'm s'posed to be on a diet... He grabs a brownie. He notices Mogwai's case.
What's in there? Pete walks over and opens the case. Mogwai hops out, onto the bed. The creature giggles. Pete is, taken aback.
What is it?
A present from my Dad. Pete picks up the creature and pets it. Pete likes Mogwai.
It's neat. Billy shrugs. Mogwai sees the brownies. The creature hops from Pete's hands, onto the desk. Mogwai grabs a brownie and starts to eat.
Hey, Billy.. .You think I might be able to borrow it? Just for a night?
I dunno, Pete...
C'mon...My Mom will never know. I'll hide it under my bed. Pete reaches down to pick up Mogwai. His hand clumsily knocks over the water bottle. A few drops of water splash Mogwai. The creature arches its back and lets out a high pitched scream. Billy is surprised. Pete takes a step back. Scared. Mogwai tenses up. The spots on its body that were hit with water begin to bubble... .expand...' Billy can't believe his eyes. Mogwai writhes in pain. The spots on its body expand more, getting bigger, bigger.. .ready to explode. Billy and Pete stare. Fascinated. The spots burst.
Billy picks up his glass of milk. He splashes some milk on one of the crealtures. Nothing happens.
They must only multiply with plain tap water.
Now can I have one?
 Huh? Well, yeah. I guess so. Pete grabs one of the creatures, taking it from the group. It cries out. In a high, piercing scream. The other creatures leap at Pete. They grab the creature and bring it back to their group.
Billy has a worried look on his face. Barney, the dog, sits in a corner of the rood. He glare at;the creatures. Jealous that they're gettjng all the atjtention .I
 What are you so worried abot?
Dad...We don't know anything about these things.
We know they're cute.. We know.." they're intelligent. And now we know they multiply by water.
Yeah, but isn't that pretty weird? I mean, if I throw water onBarney over there, we're not gonna;getjten copies. A creature licks Rand's ear. He chuckles.
All I know, is that I've got a million dollars sitting in my lap.
Huh?
I'm going to market these things.
 Oh, Christ. C'mo'i,Dad...that's ...
Just imagine the excitement when word gets out. Everyone will want a Mogwai of their very own.
Don't you think we should have them checked out first? Just to make sure...
No. If we want to make a big profit, we have to move:fast I have some investors coming over to the house on Thursday.  Who,knows?...Mogwai could replace dog as man's best friend. wls from his corner. Rand continues to play with the creatures. Billy watches. Skeptical.
Oh, hi Gary. Look, I'm kind of in a hurry. Gary grabs Billy by the collar and throws him against the car.

the Biology teacher, stands at the sink. He's washing out some used glass j4rs and basins Roy is 35 years old. Tall. Thin. Black. Good looking. Pete knocks on the door. Billy enters with him. Roy turns.
Hey, Pete-what's up?
Mr. Hanson...this is my friend Billy. He wants to talk to you about somethin'.
 Well, sure...  .I'm Roy Hanson. What can I do
Well, you're the closest thing this town's got to a scientist... and I need some information about an animal.
What kind of animal?
That's what I'm trying to figure out.
Billy enters with Roy and Pete. Roy stares at the creatures. He is shocked. Delighted.
I've never seen anything like this. Billy grabs the water bottle.
Watch this. Billy squeezes a drop of water on one creature. Mogwa' lets out a scream. A lump appears on the creature's back. The lump gets bigger...bigger...bigger ... Roy watches with wide eyes. Suddenly, another creature bursts from Mogwai's body. NINE IDENTICAL CREATURES now stand on the desk top.
 Holy shit. He remains-speechless for a few moments. He looks at Billy.
May.I stay for a while?...Run a few tests?...
(nods, checks his
My parents won't be home until 7:00. You've got three hours. Roy takes off his coat and opens his black leather case. Billy exits with Pete.
"How The Grinch Stole Christmas" plays.
I discovered some interesting things...
Yeah...that's what happened when I tried to take one.
If one is separated. The others will follow.
Anything else?
They qan't multiply by water if their environment temperature is below '25 degrees-  It's amazing. They have no bio- logical link with any other species of animal...in the whole world. Billy gives an uncertain nod.-
Billy wakes. He sits up in bed. The sounds continue. He looks around the room. The creatures are gone. Billy notices his room door.
Billy walks. Sword in hand. The noises get louder. Crisper. Clearer. Nervous, Billy descends the dark stairs. He arrives at the bottom. He stops to listen. The sounds are coming from the living room.
Billy enters. He looks to the floor. Beneath the'Christmas tree. The creatures surround Barney. They have killed the dog. Billy tries to move. He's frozen. The creatures are eating the dog. They look up at Billy. Their bright green eyes are fiery. Blood covers their mouths. They smile. They giggle. Billy screams.
Rand carries the bag up a ladder that leads into the attic.
This should keep them out for the rest of the niht...
Tomorrow we'll take them out in the sun...
.and.finish them off. Lynn nods. Rand looks at Billy.
I'm sorry, son. I never expected to...
Forget it. Billy stares coldly at his Father. Embarrassed, Rand looks away.
We should all get back to sleep. Rand puts his arm around Lynn. They walk to their bed- room. Billy looks up at the attic door. The creatures' scratching is heard.
What in the hell?... Billy picks up a broomstick andl pokes one of the things. Won't budge. Hard as a rock.
Damn things are stuck to the floor. Rand picks up a baseball bat. He raises it over his head and swings down, hard. Against the pod. The bat snaps in two. The pod is unblemished. Rand rubs his stinging hands. Billy and Rand just look at each other. Puzzled.
r?1ND Like a butterfly?
Exactly. Those things in the attic-are cocoons. Inside,. the creatures are going through some sort of change...a metamorphosis.
Why did they attack my dog?
Simple. They're animals. They were hungry. Aside from water, food is their main concern.
How long until they hatch?
A week...a month...I really can't say.
Billy, don't be hasty...You've stumbled onto a new life form. What comes out of those cocoons could be a major scientific discovery...
Screw'science. I want them des- troyed.
Billy ...Maybe Mr. Hanson's got a point...
 Dad, they killed Barney. Or have you already forgotten? Rand just looks'at his son. Lynn pops a valium in the background.
Red hot light. The flame of a torch.
Not even warm. (shakes his head,
They're indestructible.
Now what do we do?
I get back from Seattle on Wednesday. I'll call some con- struction people. They'll come in next week and cut these things out of the floor.
I don't think we should wait. Let's do it ourselves.
No. It's late. I've got an early plane to catch.
Son, you've got to stop worrying.
a sign hangs on the-door:
A wall clock reads 5:25. Billy counts out money to a customer. Tracy works beside him. Finished with the customer, Billy looks to the line of waiting people.
Next.

 Hello, Mrs. Deagle. How are you this afternoon?

Lynn removes freshly bakedSanta Claus sugar cookies from the Microwave oven.

I want to speak to Mr.. Fresco!  Mr.Fresco! ...Mr. Fresco!. Roland Fresco, the Vice President, gets.up from his desk. He walks over to Mrs. Deagle and Billy. Everyonein the bank is watching. Billy bites his bottom lip, holding in his anger.
 Apologize to the woman, Billy.
Apologize. Now. Billy turns to the woman. Everyone in the bank is.watching. Especially Tracy.
 Mrs. Deagle, I...

Lynn exits the kitchen and slowly walks upstairs.
Nervous. Sweating. Behind the wheel of his car. He tries to drive fast, but the heavy snowfall and icy roads prevent it. Outside, the sun is going down.
She's arrived at the top of the stairs. It's dark up here. She looks to the end of the hallway.

Billy. He runs home through the snow. It's dusk. People have begun to turn on their Christmas lights. Billy runs harder. Faster. His house comes into view. At the e nd o f the block.
Something leaps out and grabs Lynn by the throat. A creature. We can't see it clearly. - It moves too fast. It is hiddenby the shadows. Other dark figures come at Lynn. More creatures. They want their share of the food. Lynn watches in horror as the creatures surround her head. She screams.

Billy grabs the sword off his wall. He walks back. into the. hallway.
Billy stands several feet from the open attic doo He clutches the sword. He takes a deep breath and flips out the hall light. Darkness. Billy waits. A few seconds pass.
leaps from the attic, into the hallway. Billy jumps back. Mogwai snarls at him. Mogwai has changed. It stands two feet tall. The brown fur is gone, replaced by rock hard, rippled armor. The arms and legs are muscular, covered with the same armor. The paws have been replaced by claws. The fingernails are sharp. The tail is long and pointed. Reptilian. It thrashes back and forth. Sharp white horns have replaced the ears. The green eyes are larger. They bulge. Evil. Angry. A:huge mouth distorts the face with its wide grin. The countless teeth are long and sharp. Gleaming white. Fresh blood drips from them. The giggle remains, undercut with a hungry animalistic growl

Billy sees Lynn's body. She lies on the floor. Dead. Billy walks to her. Lynn is covered with bites and scratches. Billy looks away. Angry. Saddened. He notices the cocoons. All hatched. Sounds echo from downstairs. Thumps. Giggles. Billy's face goes white with fear. There's more. He dashes out of the attic.
Billy walks slowly. Clutching his sword. Ready for an attack. He descends the stairs.
leaps from the overhead chandelier. It lands on Billy's back. The creature tries to bite Billy's neck. Billy slams his blade 'nto Mogwai. He whacks the creature. Again and again. Finally, Mogwai falls to the floor. Billy brings down his blade. Hard. It slices Mogwai's head off. The creature's body quivers. It dies. Billy moves to the living room.
Dimly lit. The fireplace burns. The Christmas tree lights flash. Billy enters.
flies at Billy from across the room. He ducks. A DINNER PLATE smashes against the wall behind him. Billy looks to the
A CREATURE sits on the middle shelf. Giggling. It throws another plate at-Billy. He bats the plate away with his sword. Mogwai continues to throw plates at him. Billy dodges the plates, making his way to the China Cabinet. There, he lunges forward with his sword. Bullseye. Mogwai is stabbed. Straight through the chest.
The creature screams, writhing in pain. It falls from the China shelf to the floor. Dead. Billy slowly moves across the room. His eyes dart back and forth, looking for creatures.' He walks by the fireplace. Three large RED VELVET STOCKINGS hang from the mantle. Each one is inscribed with a name: BILLY, RAND and LYNN.

He clutches his sword. Tight. Two creatures leap at him. He spears one in mid-air. He quickly spins around, knocking the other Mogwai to the ground. He stabs the creature in the throat. He twists the sword until Mogwai chokes to death on its own blood. The remaining creature attaches itself to Billy's leg. It takes a bite from his calf. Billy cries out in pair. Mogwai stays on. Biting hard. Billy kicks his leg near the fireplace. Scared of the firelight, Mogwai lets go. Billy stabs the creature.. He holds Mogwai in the roaring flames of the fireplace. Mogwai screams until it burns to a crisp. Billy removes his steaming sword. The charred creature collapses into the flames. Dead. Billy checks his leg. A small bite. He walks to the kitchen.

are inside. They don't notice Billy. One has crawled into the large blender. It laps up the left over white icing. The other sits on the table. It nibbles on the Santa cookies. Billy looks at the bl!ende1r. It's' unplugged. Billy moves quickly. He dashes across the room and plugs in the blender. It starts with'a loud whirr. The startled creature spins inside.. Mogwai's screams die as it is chopped into a green mush. The remaining creature growls at Billy. Billy lunges forward with his sword. Mogwai leaps out of the way, onto the kitchen cabinet. Billy turns to the creature. Mogwai stands in front of the open microwave oven. Billy pokes at the creature with his sword. Mogwai takes a few steps back. Billy still pokes at Mogwai, forcing the creature into the oven. Billy quickly closes theoven door. Mogwai is trapped inside.
Inside, Mogwai screams and pounds against the glass door. Soon, the creature falls.' Its body quivers. The armor-,. like skin bubbles and pops. Mogwai boils to death. Bill wipes the swea from hs brow and exits the kitchen.
Billy enters. He looks at the dead creatures. He sighs. Relieved. They're all gone. Billy rests his sword against the wall. He picks up the telephone and dials "0".
Yes, could you connect me with the Sheriff's Office?...
Hello? ...Is this Sheriff Lucia?...
tears the phone cord from the wall.
walks toward Billy, ready to attack from behind.
 Hello?... It hisses.
Billy turns. Face to face with Mogwai. Billy glances to his sword. A few feet away. Against the wall. Mogwai takes a step closer. Billy reaches for the sword. The creature leaps and lands on Billy's chest, knocking him to the floor. { .Billy wrestles with the creature. He tries to grab the sword, but Mogwai is clawing and biting at him. Billy's hand finally reaches the sword. He snatches it. He brings down the blade, into the creature's arm. Mogwai jumps back. Wounded. Billy stands. He raises his sword to finish off the creature. Mogwai dodges theblade, jumping to the window ledge. Billy moves toward the creature. Mogwai smashes through'the window, escaping into the night. Billy hurries out of the house.
The blizzard is starting up. Billy arrives at the broken window. He looks to the ground and sees

Are you okay?
 A monster came out of Skippy the Snowman. Billy quickly attacks the snowman with his sword. He swings and swings until "Skippy" is nothing but a pile of snow. But there is no sign of Mogwai. Billy spots footprints leading away from the snowman. Mogwai has escaped. Billy runs after the footprints. Peggy watches him disappear around the corner of the house. Peggy's Mother opens the door. She is puzzled by the pile of snow in front of Peggy.
Peggy...What happened to your snowman?
 This ugly little monster came out of Skippy's chest! It tried
to pull me inside and eat me! But this man with a big sword came over and saved me! Peggy's Mother just.stares at her. She shakes her head.

Billy falls backward, with Mogwai holding onto him. They tumble into the swimming pool. The deep end.
Billy separates himself from the creature. He swims to the side of the pool and gets out. He runs and picks up his sword. He looks at the scratches on his chest. They bleed. But he'll live.

Billy and Tracy start to climb up the ladder. But the two other creatures come out of Tracy'.s bedroom window. They see Billy and Tracy below. They climb oft after them, down the ladder. Billy and Tracy are trapped. Sandwiched between the creatures. Billy looks to his sword on the ground. So far away.
Hey, C'mon...
I got a headache.
So when are you gonna make me Deputy?
When you grow up.
Why don't you fire Brent. He's nothin' but a drunk. I'could do a lot better. They arrive at the outskirts of town. Frank notices some- thing up ahead. He can see the shadows of the creatures. Crawling on houses. Running across the front lawns. Frank motions for Gary to slow down.

Billy drives, as fast as possible through the heavy snow. He's headed out of town. Tracy sits beside him. She looks out the window..
The rows of once peaceful, cheerful homes are now the scenes of frenzied horror. People run out into the night, screaming for help, only to be dragged to the ground by creatures. Ravaged bodies lie in the snow. Frozen. An ambulance is overturned on the roadside. Phone lines are town down. The creatures have made their way across town. They now attack the last few houseson the block.

The headlights shine on Frank's overturned police car. Gary is inside. Still alive. He screams for help.
I'll get him out. Billy quickly opens the police car door. He jumps out.
He closes the door. Tracy is safe inside. Billy walks to the.sheriff's car. He stays in the safety of the headlight's beam. Billy stops a few feet from the sheriff's car. The passenger side is crushed. The driver's side is barely damaged, save for a dented, jammed door. Gary pounds against-the door. He wants out. Billy grabs the car handle. He pulls hard. The door pops open. He pulls Gary out. Gary gets to his feet. He's okay. Billy looks inside the car. Billy closes the door.
What.about my brother? Can we get him out?
He's dead. Tears fill Gary's eyes. Billy leads Gary to the car.
C'mon. Just stay in the light. They're afraid of the light. Gary walks. He looks scared. Helpless. They get to the police car. Billy opens the door.
Tracy. She smiles. Glad to see him alive. They kiss. Gary puts his arm around her.. Billy hops into the driver's seat. He rests the sword beside him.--He--starts the car and continues to drive., Gary gives Tracy another kiss. He needs her comfort. Billy just stares ahead, at the snowy road.
Everything here looks calm. Untouched. Safe. The police car pulls into the driveway.
Billy turns to Gary and Tracy.
We're just outside of town... Doesn't look like the creature's got here yet.  Let's go inside and warm up. They exit the police car.
comes to the door. He sees the worn, hollow faces of Gary and Tracy. He sees the bruised and bloodied Billy.
What the hell happened to you? Billy looks at Dorry.
Billy finishes telling the full story to everyone.
.and they originate from this marketplace in Hong Kong. Dorrystands and shakes his head.
Hard to believe. Like Satan's come to walk the earth.
 You see...they''re drawn to water. Now, if my hunch is correct... They'll be leaving town, and heading for the water tower-which means they'll have to pass by here tonight.  We have to get help. These things have to be kept under control. If they get to the water tower .they could spread all over the St ate... maybe the Country. They're like inhuman divining rods.
Why didn't you think of that before, Peltzer?
I did. But nobody would listen.
Maybe if you weren't such a nut people would believe you.
Nowt boys...arguing won't get us anywhere. Gary still glares at Billy.
This is your fau t, Peltzer.
That's not true.
My brother's dead because of you.
That isn't..
The people in town. They're dead because of you.
You did it. You killed all those people.. You're. a murderer, Peltzer. Billy lunges at Gary. They fall to the ground. Fighting. Dorry and Tracy break it up.
If we want to stay . alive... We have to stick together. Billy turns away. Cooling off. Gary is comforted by Tracy. But she keeps her eye on Billy. Dorry looks at everyone.
We should get in touch with the authorities.
Yeah, and then I'd like to try and get in touch with my Dad. If we can...
Gary's cigarette lighter illuminates the room. Everyone stays quiet. They listen. THE GIGGLING of several creatures echoes from outside.
They're here. A frightened Gary holds Tracy.
Now what do we do? The giggling gets louder. Closer. Billy turns to Dorry.
Do you have a place without win dows?... .A place where we could be safe? Dorry pauses to think.
The storage room The sound of breaking glass is heard.
 We have to hurry. Dorry leads everyone.out of the.room...
We'll stay ere until daybreak. Gary sits with Tracy on an old sofa. Dorry sits beside them in anold rocking chair. Billy pulls up an old wooden'chair.
Mischevious little devils, aren't they? No one disagrees. Tracy suddenly notices something. She cries out.

I've only been this scared two other times in my life. Once was when I got drafted. The other, was when I was six years old.  It.was Christmas Eve. My sisters and I were decorating the tree with our Mother. We were singing caroles...happy ...excited... waiting for Dad to get home from work.  A few hours passed, and we started to worry. Dad wasn't home yet. My Mother called the office. They said he left.
He was going to surprise us.
Well...I think you should all try and get some sleep.  I'll watch the door. Everyone agrees. Billy moves his chair in front of the door. .Dorry relaxes.inhis rocking chair. Gary stretches out on the sofa, expecting Tracy to cuddle with him. Instead,"she walks:over to Billy.
Billy... He looks at her. She gives him a comforting smile.
I just wanted to say thanks... I mean...If it wasn't for you, I don't know what any of us would have done. Billy smiles.
is it okay if I sleep here? On the floor beside you?...I'd feel a lot safer. Billy nods. Tracy moves a carpet next to Billy's chair. She lies on the carpet. She closes her eyes. Gary watches from the sofa. Jealous.
sleeping in his chair. His hand still holds the sword on his lap. The others are asleep. Billy's hand quivers. The sword drops to the floor. He wakes. Startled. He quickly grabs the sword. Everyone else wakes from the sound.
 Everything's okay...I just dropped my sword. Gary rubs his eyes.
What time is it?

Billy stands. He pushes the wood cabinet from the door The door is covered with scratches. Billy slowly opens it.
the four people through the house. Into the kitchen, the bedrooms, the hallways. Every room has been destroyed by the creatures.
Dorry is shocked to see his store in this state. Billy walks to the front door. He tries to open it. It's jammed. He pulls hard. Finally., it opens.
A blanket of snow. covers everything. It snowed hard last night.. Three feet's worth.
Try. the phone. .see if we can get help... Dorry walks back inside. Gary flips on a transistor radio that has been sitting on the shelf.
All major highways and roads are closed. Driving is close to
impossible. It looks like we're gonna be snowbound for the Holidays. Dorry returns.
Phone's. dead.
Damn.
We're trapped.
I think we should get out. Now.
How? The nearest town is fifteen miles away.
I'll walk.
In this? You won't get far.
It's worth'a try.
And-what happens when it gets dark? ...And you're on the road. Alone. Gary says nothing.
No. We have to stick together and fight these things. At least until we can get help... Tracy folds her arms.
I'm cold. Gary puts his arm around her. She'd rather have Billy's.
There's a McDonald's about a block away.
Okay. We 11 get something to eat. , Them we go 1 to wJork.
The creatures have been here. The dead body of an old man is slumped across a table. A half eaten Big Mac is still in his hand. In a booth, sits a dead family: Mother, Father, boy and girl. Their food still sits-in front of them. Untouched. A dead cashier girl lies on the counter.
Not bad, Peltzer. I-didn't know you could cook.
Could there be other people in town? Alive?
It's.possible. But it's more important to get at the creatures. We've got the advantage now. It's daylight.
You know where they are, Peltzer?
No...But they're all gathered in one place. And the sun rose before they could make it to the water tower. So they must be holed up between here and there.
The old church?
 Too many windows. Too much light. it's got to be someplace dark. Totally dark.
How about somebody's garage?... Or tool shed?...
No. There's too many of them.. They'd need a huge area...
Ridge's movie house. Everyone pauses to think.
It's a big place. No windows.
Always dark. Pitch black. Billy nods to himself. That's the place.
You used to work here, right?
You're coming in with me., You can show me around.
What are you going to do if they're inside?
Blow up the theater. Everyone seems puzzled. Billy turns to Gary.
This place has some kind of boiler room...with a furnace... right?
 I'll use the gas lines as a bomb. The fire will destroy the creatures. Dorry looks at Billy.
I want to come in with you.You'11 need the extra hand.
Well I'm not staying out here alone. It's getting dark. Billy nods. -They'll all go in together.
Okay...just remember;.We've got to stick together. And keep close to the flashlight. They're scared of the light. Everyone nods. Gary turns on the flashlight. Tracy takes Billy's hand. Gary is jealous. They enter the theater.
The popcorn machine is empty. The soda machine has been emptied and turned on its side. Billy walks to the theater entrance door. He looks into the small window.
They're inside the theater. The others peer into the window.
 How do we get to the boiler room?
Damn. There's too many of those things. They'll- see us.
I have an 'idea'.- They look .t her .
Billy, Tracy, Dorry and Gary enter. Tracy walks to the projector.. She finds the forward switch. She flips it. The projector purrs. The lamp goes on. The reels turn.

They move carefully. Slowly. Silently. They make it to the Exit. They Crawl out. safe.- The creatures still watchthe movie.
Billy takes off his coat and shirt. He removes his T-shirt. He looks at Gary.
Give me your T-shirt. Gary reluctantly takes. off his T-shirt. Billy ties the two shirts together. He winds them into a cord. He finds a connection in the gas line. He begins to pound against it with the handle of his sword. The. sounds of metal ring out.
We have to get out. Fast. Gary points to a rear exit.
That leads outside.
burst into the room. Gary panics. He pulls out a gun and starts shooting.
Not your gun. There's too many. Use the light. Gary stops shooting and fumbles for his flashlight. A creature leaps atDorry, pinning the old man to the ground. Other creatures attack Dorry. Biting. Scratching. Tearing. Billy picks up his sword and begins to knock the creatures off Dorry. Creatures come at Tracy. She picks up a section of thick lead pipe and bats off the oncoming Mogwai. Gary finally turns on the flashlight beam. It keeps some of the Mogwai at bay. Fire creeps up the T-shirt, getting closer to the gas line. Billy gets all-the creatures off Dorry. More creatures come through the door. Gary gets scared. He drops the flashlight and runs for the rear exit.
 Get back here! We need you! .Gary runs out, leaving the others alone. Billy and Tracy continue to fight the creatures.
Let's go. Billy picks up Dorry's body. Tracy protects him by batting away any oncoming creatures. They hurry out of the boiler room.
Billy.carries Dorry's body. He and Tracy run to the exit.
Camera moves through the flames. Some creatures scream, burning to death. Others try to avoid the flames. Camera moves to the ceiling.
You bastard. You ran out on us. Left us alone. To die. Billy drops his sword and jumps Gary. They fall to the ground. Fighting. Punching.
Gary! ...No!... Billy dodges the blad. Gary moves closer to Billy. The sword is inches away from Billy's chest. Gary swings. Billy steps back. The tip of the sword scratches across his chest. Tracy cries out. Gary lunges at him again. Billy is scratched across the s tomach-. Billy is backed against,a building wall. Gary pulls back his sword, ready to spear Billy..

 Hear that? He's calling his friends for help. They're following us. As long as he's alive and screaming... they'll come after him.
We can't kill him. He's our bait. We'll be able to lead them away from the water tower. (points to the back seat) Just keep an eye on the thing... make s re it doe n' hurt us. Tracy keeps the swo d on the cre ture. Billy guns the engine and screeches off. He looks to the rearview mirror.
