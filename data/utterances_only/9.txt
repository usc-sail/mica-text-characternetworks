Experiment 208, day 20...
Useless.
Please.   Give it a chance.
One more.      That's all. We turns to leave. We hear the clicking of boots as the soldiers accompany him out.
 My last possible solution....  It must work...
Perfect.
 You see, it evolves.
CHILLINGLY) Yes. Perfect.
 Alert. We are in a state of emergency...
...the Machines have become uncontrollable... they are shooting at will... ALERT: stay in your homes.
 My invention... my beauty... beauty was taken...
Reports are coming in... they've breached the Northern walls of the city...
An announcement from our Chancellor!
 Comrades, I have lost control. The Machine is now our enemy. We need to join forces to fight against it.
his voice a mere whisper NOW) Five so far....I can't get them right...
 Gas masks are being distributed... ALERT: beware....
...deadly gas....
a feeble whisper) My last one... this one, finally, must work... it must....
..he is on the tabletop in the RUINS OF A SMALL ROOM.
 Friend... I am a friend.
The details... how exciting.  Carved wood... steel bolts... molded copper...
You can't speak.
Yes, yes...
...come with me.
Here!
 No! Stop!
QUIETLY) Some things in this world are better left where they lie.
But if you know where to look, these ruins are full of riches.
 ...almost there...
 GO!
Alone? Was he all right? hen is he coming back?
can't think of the right WORD) hing! It took him.
 There's a path ahead--
 Follow me.
I led us here...
...to sanctuary. And here we waited for the war to end.
The only thing that remains now is the Beast.
So we stay hidden and we wait for it, too, to sleep.
The source.... The source...
looking around at the map, bits and pieces, etc.) All his work... trying to make sense of everything.
Is he out there? Is he still alive?
Why do you listen to 1?
 Come with me. I can't do it alone.
5(c nt it, DEFY 1) I can't.
You're going to need a map.
There.
2 will be so impressed!
SSEMBLY LINE
 Why would it bring him here?
 I shouldn't have waited...
I think I know why.
he Machine points the talisman towards 2 and it OPENS up to a sparking green glow. 2 struggles in the Machine's claw but the strange green energy SHOOTS directly into 2's mouth and eyes, painfully  his soul.
My poor old friend...
What WAS that? What is it doing?
They've been here? The whole time?
 They're cataloguing.
We need you--we awakened something--
-Dutch-angle shots of the Dictator, and we hear his SPEECH--
...yes, we have entered a new future, the age of the intelligent machine. This remarkable invention can adapt and evolve, creating new machines, machines of  PEACE---
--that will usher in a new era of PROSPERITY--
--and brotherhood for our nation!
Wait! 6... he always draws that. used to keep the drawings... with his notes....
 I saved everything.
You awakened what?
1 You fools! I warned you!
He warned you.
Now you've put us all in unimaginable peril. And, may I ask, did you manage to save 2? Of course not! By following this witless folly, you've endangered everything we work for! 152                                                      152 Why was 2 sent out to begin with? 153                                                      153  I sent him to scout. 153.5                                                    153.5
 I won't allow you to endanger us further.  Subjugate them.
1  Take their belongings! grabs 6's drawing and lifts 5 from his crossbow and shakes him up. 9 tries to stop him.
ou're nothing but a coward!
 How dare you challenge me! I, who kept everyone safe all these years. Ever since you got here everything has been unraveling. You're a curse. A fool guided by pointless queries.
The sky... the sky is breaking....
ometimes fear is the appropriate response.
flees. 8 charges the Beast but it SCYTHES its wing towards him and knocks 8 across the floor. 8 slides across the floor to 1, who stands next to 6's picture of the Cat Beast.
he Beast flinches just as it FIRES its harpoon tail at them. Blinded by the glare, it MISSES and almost hits 8.
 My spear!
9 (to 1; holding out his STAFF) Grab on!
 The propeller! Start the propeller!
You fool! We can still save ourselves!
You wanted us to forget you, too?
 Why did you leave us?
EMPTY_LINE
 I just couldn't. It's... (contrite, trying to explain herself to her FRIEND) It's not in my nature.
What is it? What can it be?
Sometimes one must be sacrificed for the good of many.
The answer to all our questions is here, in some way. I can feel it. We must follow this path...
 No....
 We have to go--all of us.   We have to rescue them--
Take charge.
More creatures!      We have to ACT! NOW!
What did I tell you?      Light it! Now!
he group turns and watches the factory as it burns to the ground. 311                                                       311  It's done.
I've been a bitter old pill, haven't I?
I lost sight... of many things.
What's past is past.
e now runs his hand over his head, which we now see has a funny looking pony-tail like protuberance.   9 hesitates, then can't help CHUCKLING. 1 sees him, then starts to LAUGH as well.
30                                                         330 No!

o!   Get across!
No!   No!   No!
Come on, we can't stay here!
t hangs on with two of its mechanical legs, one on each side in the broken bridge. Inexorably, it begins working its way back up...
339                                                           339 efforts prying off the Fabrication Machine) Pry it loose!

 He has to go --
No!
You heard him: "Come for us." They're still inside--
 "The first room...."
 The source... the First Room...
 It had such promise... my first creation...
 ...but it was taken... and bent to such evil...
...so little hope remains... that is why I create you...
 I am unable to reverse the transfer process... my life force diminishes with each one of you... it is all right... you will thrive...
...so little hope remains... that is why I create you...
tenderly, to 9 directly) ... it's up to you now... (with his last breath of ENERGY) ...you...you are all the pieces of my soul...
The Scientist! The one who made the machine. He gave us life too.
We're all that remains.
No!    Don't destroy it!
It powers down right after it takes a soul!   Just for a few seconds.
No!    What are you doing?   Stop!
Sometimes one must be sacrificed for the good of many.
