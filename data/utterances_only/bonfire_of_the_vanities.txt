You are not taking the dog for a walk. You are taking 'Marshall' for a walk. Marshall has a name. He is one of our family. And, anyway, it's raining. SHERMAN I know that. The DOG GROWLS and snaps at Sherman.
So does Marshall. I don't think he wants to go. Do you, Marshall?                     * SHERMAN Judy... JUDY Alright.   Alright. Sherman gets the leash fastened.

Yes, of course. Come on, Marshall.
POLLARD Hello, Sherman.
Good evening, Pollard. POLLARD You know it's raining, don't you? SHERMAN Yes. As a matter of fact, I did notice. POLLARD Ah, Sherman. A true friend to man's best friend. SHERMAN Pollard, you old phrase-maker.
I beg your pardon.
I mean, is that the best you can do? Is that as witty as we get?
POLLARD I don't know what you're talking about. And furthermore, if you plan on being wet when you return, I suggest you take the service elevator.
Maria!    Hello. It's me.
Who? SHERMAN Oh.    Sorry.    May I speak to Maria?
Who is this? SHERMAN Maria? Brief pause, then... WOMAN Sherman? Sherman is about to say "yes" when he catches himself. CUT TO:
Sherman, is that you?
Jesus!
Well, we're back!
Well, you were right. I got soaking wet and Marshall didn't do anything.
Sherman, if you want to talk to somebody named Maria, why do you call me instead? Sherman pokes his head into the room.
If I what?   Whatever do you mean? JUDY Please don't lie. It makes your                       * forehead crinkle.                                     * SHERMAN About what? Wait a minute.

Who? 
Judy, I was out walking the dog. I was not on the telephone.
Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.                             * SHERMAN I'm not   lying. I took Marshal for a walk,   and I come back in here and wham   -- I mean I hardly know what to   say. You're asking me to prove a   negative proposition.
'Negative proposition'?! Oh, God, Sherman. Listen to the way I sound. Listen to the stress. Can                       * you hear it? I don't want to be                        * this person. I don't.

Campbell! CAMPBELL She's crying on the lifecycle. PETER On the lifecycle again. You see? Like all those other women she spends so much time with. So drawn, so pale. You could see lamplight through their bones...
She won't kiss me because I'm all wet.

GENE But what the hell is this crazy Giscard deal going to cost us, Sherman? SHERMAN I need six hundred million to buy up the bonds... GENE  Jesus. You want us to sit on six hundred million dollars worth of French government bonds?!
I'm confident on this, Gene.   It's a real sleeping beauty. A THROTTLED ROAR comes out of the SPEAKER. RAWLIE Where are you, Gene?
Tottenham Park. At a cricket match. Somebody's just hit the hell out of the ball. The ball's kind of dead, though. RAWLIE Who's playing?
Don't get technical on me, Rawlie. Bunch of nice young men in white flannel pants.

SHERMAN Be careful.   There's... But before he can say it, a loud, dead sound -- THOK! Sherman looks back...
I wonder if we should report this to the police.
The police?
I mean we were almost robbed and I think maybe it's possible you... we hit one of them. There was this kind of... There was this sound. Did you hear it? Like we hit one of them. MARIA Did you see him get hit? SHERMAN No.
Neither did I. So if the question ever comes up, all that happened was, two boys blocked the road and tried to rob us and we got away. That's all we know. They go into... climbing the stairs.
But if we called the police now... MARIA Yes, let's call them and invite them over here to our little love nest. They would love to get their hands on us. The police and the press and all the rest of the 'mediarites.' SHERMAN Meteorites?
I'd just feel better if... Maria drops everything and turns on him... MARIA You don't have to feel better, Sherman. I was the one who was driving. And I'm saying I didn't hit anybody, and I'm not reporting anything to the police! And if you are a gentleman, you will support me in that decision. Silence. They are both out of breath. They look at each other. Then Maria starts to unbutton her blouse.
 We were in the jungle... we were attacked... we fought our way out. SHERMAN It's true.   We could have been killed. MARIA We fought.   I feel like an animal.
You drove the hell out of that car.
The hard part was getting into the seat, getting over that gear shift.
It was instinct. MARIA That tire...
He was big... wasn't he?
You were bigger, Sherman.    You were great...
We were both great. MARIA This could be the best sex we've had in a long time. SHERMAN I don't know.    I still think... MARIA Don't think, Sherman.    Don't think. Just fuck.

Which means, loosely translated, that you have no evidence. KRAMER Your Honor, the District Attorney, Mr. Weiss... JUDGE WHITE                           * I know who the district attorney is. I know Mr. Weiss. And the only reason Mr. Weiss is interested in the case is because Mr. Williams over there is a white man who lives in a nice big house in Riverdale. KRAMER I don't follow, sir... JUDGE WHITE                           * Because this is an election year. Because ninety-nine percent of the people you shovel through here are black and the other ninety-nine percent don't even speak English. But they do vote. 
So you go tell your boss, the district attorney, Captain Ahab Weiss that I know he's out there looking for the great white defendent... but Mr. Williams over there is not it.

So why are you coming to us? You got a victim who's unconscious, you got no witness, no driver -- you got what we call here a piece of shit. Ain't that right, Mr. Kramer? Martin and Goldberg look at each other.

 Oh, yes, Sherman, do explain it.
Yes. Your mother and I really want to hear this, Sherman. SHERMAN A bond is a way of lending   people money.  Let's say you want   to build a road or a hospital   and you need a lot of money. Well,    you issue a bond... CAMPBELL Do you build roads?
No, I don't actually build them... MR. McCOY I think you're in over your head. More laughter.
Here. Let me try. Darling, Daddy doesn't build roads or hospitals or anything, really. Daddy just handles the bonds for the people who raise the money. CAMPBELL That's what he said. Bonds.
Yes. See, just imagine that a bond is a slice of cake. Now you didn't bake that cake, but every time you hand somebody a slice of that cake, a little bit comes off, little crumbs fall off. And you're allowed to keep those crumbs. 
 And many a man has sold his soul for those little crumbs.
 Yes. And that's what Daddy does. He passes somebody else's cake around and picks up the crumbs. But you have to imagine a lot of crumbs. And a great golden cake. And a lot of golden crumbs. And you have to imagine Daddy running around picking up every little golden crumb he can get his hands on. That's what Daddy does. SHERMAN Well, you can call them crumbs if you want to... JUDY That's the best I can do.   Excuse me.
MR. McCOY Of course, in my day, there was some integrity to it...
Yes.   Well... MR. McCOY Now it's not about anything, is it? Except the money. SHERMAN I don't make the rules.
All the more reason not to play the game.
We're having a little... It's nothing serious. Really.
Of course, up to this point in our story, I was blissfully ignorant. I had no idea of the storm that was gathering. Never even heard of Sherman McCoy. Hadn't the faintest notion that soon his name would be inexorably tied to mine. That his fate would be inextricably bound to my own destiny.
PETER I had my own problems. And I simply had no idea that Sherman McCoy was the solution I was looking for. 105    ANGLE - CAROLINE HEFTSHANK AND FILIPPO CHIRAZZI             105    *

You'll read all about it in the newspapers. Come on. Let's do R.E., R.P. and R.B. and see what we get.
Henry Lamb?   Who's that?
He was a student of yours at Ruppert High. In your English class. RIFKIN He was?   What's he done?
He was seriously injured. I'm a journalist. I write for a newspaper. RIFKIN Oh.   I don't remember him.
What I would like to find out is what kind of student he was. RIFKIN Well, if I don't remember him, I guess he was okay. PETER Would you say he was a 'good' student? RIFKIN 'Good' doesn't really apply to Ruppert High. They're either cooperative or life-threatening. There's no in-between.
His mother says he was considering going to college.
Well, she means City College. They have an open admissions policy. So, if you live in the city and you graduate from high school and you're still breathing, they have to take you. 
Fallow.
I got sixty-five students in every class...
Do you have any of his written work? RIFKIN Oh, Jesus, there hasn't been any written work at Ruppert High since... oh, fifteen years. Maybe twenty. PETER Well, there must be some record of how he measures up to the others... RIFKIN No. See, you're thinking about grades and honor students and high achievers. We don't make those kinds of comparisons. We're just trying to keep them off the street. At Ruppert High, an honor student is somebody who comes to class and doesn't piss on the teacher.
 Well, by that standard, is Henry Lamb an honors student?
Well, he never pissed on me. So by that standard, yes. I guess he must be.

Okay.   No problem. I'm all done. He packs up and leaves.
Christ.   That was close. SHERMAN What's going on?
Nothing. Caroline pays $351 for this place. It's rent controlled. I sublet it for eleven hundred a month. But it's not legal. They would love to get Caroline out of here. But they have to prove she doesn't live here. SHERMAN You don't think it's weird this fellow showed up today. After that unconscionable piece in the paper. MARIA Oh, Sherman. You are    completely paranoidical. Look, I    have to leave for the airport   in twenty minutes. So we don't    have much time. SHERMAN You don't think they could possibly trace the car to me?
Right. There is the other boy, however. Suppose he came forward.
If he was gonna materialize, he would have done it by now. And the reason he hasn't, is because he's a criminal. Would you get my blue jacket out of that closet? Sherman gets the jacket.

My wife. Sometimes. And the people at the garage.
Parking garage. SHERMAN Yes. MARTIN You leave the car with the keys and they park it.
Well... yes. MARTIN Could we go there and take a look at it?
The car? MARTIN Yes. SHERMAN Now? MARTIN Soon as we leave here. We could take a look. There's things that's consistent with an incident like this. We don't find those things, we move on down the list. And we're out of your hair.
So you want to take a look at the car then.
I see.
We don't have a description of a driver. So we gotta look for the car. And that means bothering a lot of innocent people. We're sorry about the inconvenience. But it's a routine sort of thing. SHERMAN I understand. But if it is a routine, well, I should, I guess I ought to... well, follow the routine that's appropriate to me, to someone with a car in this situation. You see?

The routine. MARTIN We just want to look at the car. SHERMAN That's what I mean. You see?
No. GOLDBERG Excuse me, Mr. McCoy. But is there something you want to tell us? 
Because, if there is, now is the time to tell us. Before things get complicated.
No. I just think... I think that, just to be sure, certain, safe... I think... GOLDBERG Let me put it this way, if you want to cooperate, that's great. If you have reasons for not cooperating, then I should tell you that you don't have to say anything. That's your right. If you want, you can say nothing at all. You also have the right to an attorney. I mean, for that matter, if you lacked the 'funds' for an attorney, the state would provide you with one -- free of charge.   If that's what you wanted.
Well, look. I guess what I should do is, I should... I should talk this over with an attorney. EVENING is moving fast as he talks with Martin and Goldberg.
... But mainly, it's the look on his face. Ain't that the truth, Marty?
Yeah. All of sudden, the bitch starts coming out of him.

... So I walk up to him and I say, hello, I'm from Legal Aid, I'm your lawyer. And he says, 'Fuck you, mother. I don't want no nigger lawyer. I want a Jew.' KRAMER Nice guy. HAYDEN This is his third drug arrest. He wants a deal.
And he'll say he was there, at the scene? HAYDEN He'll say whatever you want him to say. 179   CLOSE ON ROLAND                                              179 CUT TO:
I'm telling you, they got nothing on you, Mr. McCoy.  Get me Andruitti over in the Bronx. Tell him it's urgent about this Henry Lamb shit.
But suppose the other fellow comes                       * forward. I swear there was another one. He was big...                               *
I believe you. It was a set-up. They were going to take you off. Sounds to me like he's got good reasons not to come forward. You just sit tight. That's what you do.
It means I want to take the initiative. I want to go to the police with Maria -- Mrs. Ruskin -- and just tell them exactly what happened. I mean, I don't know about the law, but I feel morally certain that we did what was right -- in the situation we were in. And I don't see... KILLIAN Ayyyy! You Wall Street honchos are real gamblers. Ayyy! Whaddaya whaddaya! They would devour you. They would eat you up. SHERMAN But why? KILLIAN Forget it's already a political football. Forget the T.V. and Reverend Bacon and Weiss has an election coming up. Forget that and remember that when you work in the D.A.'s office and every day you prosecute people with names like Tiffany Latour and Sancho Rodriguez and Chong Wong and Shabazz Kazan Tamali, you are dying to get your hands on a nice white couple like you and Mrs. Ruskin. Biscuit city, ehhh! You open your mouth and they will arrest you. And they will make a big show out of arresting you. And it will be very unpleasant.
That is guaranteed. Believe me, you do not want to be arrested in the South Bronx.  Yeah. Oh. Put him on. Yeah? I'll hold.  I need to talk to your friend, Mrs. Ruskin, too. SHERMAN I understand you went to Yale.
Yeah.     You, too. Huh? SHERMAN What did you think of it? KILLIAN It was okay. As law schools go. They give you the scholarly view. You know. It's terrific for anything you want to do -- as long as it doesn't involve real people.  Hey, Andruitti, you guinea, how are you? Yeah. Well, I'm sitting here with Sherman McCoy. Yeah. That's right. Well, I don't know if he needs a lawyer. What do you think? (winks at Sherman and smiles) Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  So what does that mean? Okay. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He puts down the phone and looks at Sherman.
We got a problem. SHERMAN What?     What is it?
They're going to arrest you.                             *
Tell him to wait. We'll be right down.
Judy comes into the room. SHERMAN  I know it was six hundred million, Rawlie. Just stop saying it. I'll straighten it out with Gene first thing in the morning. Well, not first thing. I have a previous appointment. JUDY  Sherman. Please. What is the matter with you? You're not even dressed and the car is already here.
What?  What car?  No, Rawlie, I can't change it.
Leon and Inez Bavardage. They are taking us to the opera. Eight o'clock. Tonight. And the car is here. SHERMAN Rawlie, I'll call you later. Just stay calm.  But why do we need a car? They only live six blocks from here.
We could walk.
I can't walk down the street in this dress. A small wind would turn me into a kite.
Then let's take a taxi. JUDY Why are we having this conversation?
Because a car is going to take us six blocks and wait there for five and a half hours and then drive us another six blocks home and it is going to cost us three hundred and forty-six dollars?! We are hemorrhaging money, Judy. It is pouring out of us with every beat of our heart. Isn't that worth talking about?!? Judy sits down and thinks. JUDY You're right. It might be cheaper in the long run to hire a permanent chauffeur. SHERMAN Judy, please...
We'll talk about it later.
We have to talk now. JUDY We can't hire a chauffeur in the next fifteen minutes. SHERMAN We haven't talked about anything for the last three weeks.
Well there's no reason to start now. 
Sherman, this is a very important evening. It will determine whether or not I will be chairman of the museum benefit this year. I cannot be upset now. We can talk about it later. SHERMAN I'm going to be arrested in the morning. JUDY Really, Sherman, you'd do anything to ruin this for me. Wouldn't you? Now please. Get dressed.

Uh... Judy... JUDY Sherman! Have you met Bobby Shalfet, from the opera? And Nunnally Voyd -- oh, and Arthur Ruskin and his wife Maria.
Well, hi. BOBBY And what do you do, Mr. McCoy?
Bonds. BOBBY Bonds. SHERMAN Bonds. BOBBY Well, the only bonds I know about are bail bonds. The group laughs and turns away from Sherman. BOBBY I was arrested last year in Montreal for pissing on a tree... As Judy tries to rejoin the group...
Sherman, couldn't you try just once, to be a little bit interesting.
I want you to meet Aubrey Buffing.
Who?
The poet. He's on the short list for the Nobel Prize. He has AIDS. You'll love him.
And even when repentence is offered, he refuses. He refuses to deny his life. The food, the drink, the flesh -- fatal as they may be -- he cannot resist them... Aubrey continues talking as he passes...
Sherman! We have to stop meeting like this. Do you know Boris, the ballet dancer?
Uh, no.
Boris, je te presente Monsieur McCoy. Sherman, voila Boris Karlevskov. He's defective.
You mean he defected.                                    * MARIA I mean he doesn't speak any English. SHERMAN Are you sure? MARIA Yes. Watch. Boris, darling, would you like me to eat your ass?
Encore du champagne, s'il vous plait. MARIA You see?   It went right over his head.
Maria, I need to talk to you. Something very... unexpected is happening.
Of course, darling, but keep smiling. My husband is watching me. Look at him. He's so pleased with himself. He's just closed a new deal. A charter business. He's going to take Arabs to Mecca on airplanes.
He'll make a fortune.
I don't think it will be too bad. My lawyer -- if you can call him that -- has received assurances that it will all be handled in an orderly fashion. MARIA He called me a whore today. Right in front of the servants. I mean, really. How does he expect me to run the house if he humiliates me in front of the help?
Yes.   Well.   You have a point. MARIA I'm sorry, Sherman.    What are we talking about? SHERMAN The other guy has come forward. He says I was driving the car. I'm going to be arrested tomorrow morning. I need to know from you ... I mean, what do you want me to say? MARIA Oh, Sherman, what...?!
Maria, darling, I need your advice about something. My designer has gone bonkers about jabots and chintz.  
Sherman, have you met Aubrey Buffing? He has AIDS.
Uh... AUBREY (shakes Sherman's hand again) Like so many of us now, with death and retribution waiting for us. Yet we go on whirling about each other... Sherman is looking past Aubrey.     He sees... 202    HIS POV - MARIA                                              202 goes to Arthur, whispers something in his ear. They leave quickly.

'Morning, Mr. McCoy.
Be careful of your clothes. My kid got all this Styrofoam shit back there. They stick to your clothes.
How do you feel? SHERMAN Top notch. Look. You said this was just a formality. KILLIAN No problem.   They promised me. SHERMAN I told Maria. I saw her last night. In case we need her. KILLIAN That explains it. She left the country this morning. You know some Italian painter named Filippo Sharutti, something like that? SHERMAN I don't know.    Why?
I think your girl friend found a new boyfriend.
But...
It's not going to be so bad. This is routine. I talked to Andruitti again last night. He promised me. We'll be in and out of there. No problem. Nobody is ever going to know it happened. MARTIN We got to cuff him.
What for?
A line of men near a little metal door and a crowd of 50 people standing in the rain. Very still. Jed Kramer                 * is there, too.
Excuse me, Mister McCoy? KILLIAN Don't talk.   What's going on here?!
You don't know me but I'm... But Peter is buried in the onslaught before he can say another word.
Jesus Christ! Get out and get that door open or we'll never get him out of the fucking car. MARTIN Bullshit reigns. Put the cuffs on him. Martin goes. Killian climbs over Sherman.      Goldberg puts cuffs on Sherman.
I'm going to jail. Aren't I?
Let me get out first. Now listen. You don't say anything. Don't cover your face. Don't hang your head. You don't even know they're there. Okay? SHERMAN I'm going to jail. help Sherman out of the car and all hell breaks loose.
Sherman!   Hey, shitface.    Over here! Goldberg, Martin and Killian try to push through the mob.
Hey, Sherman, how you going to plead? Peter Fallow falls to the ground.     Sherman and Goldberg step on him as they push ahead.
You ever been arrested before? Who's the brunette? What were you doing in the Bronx? Why didn't you stop, Sherman? Sherman! This way! This way! How's your wife taking this, Sherman? A microphone is shoved into Sherman's face. 
 Don't make any statements! Don't talk to anybody, especially in the pens!  I'll be upstairs when they bring you up for arraignment... KRAMER You may have a long wait, Mr. Killian. If I have anything to say about it. KILLIAN Yeah?   Fuck you, too, Kramer. 219   ANGLE - PETER FALLOW                                            219 pulls himself up off the ground.

C)   Sherman removes his belt.    His pants drop to his hips.
Whoa.   Whoa. Give me your coat. Okay.   Try it again.
GOLDBERG What the fuck? Wait a minute. Come here. Bend over. Sherman looks terrified. GOLDBERG I ain't going to touch you. Just bend over at the waist and back through the gate. Real slow. Sherman bends over at a ninety-degree angle and, holding up his trousers, shuffles backwards through the gate. GOLDBERG Slow. Slow. Slow. A little farther, little farther. Little farther. Little farther... As Sherman's head goes through the gate, the ALARM SOUNDS. Goldberg jumps up and down and claps his hands with delight.
Hey, Martin.   Come here.   Look at this.
GOLDBERG Okay, Sherman. Do that again. Real slow.
It's his head! Swear to Christ. It's his head. Open your mouth.

You're what? 
For my life. For everything. I am truly sorry.

Your Honor...
No bail! No bail! Lock him up! Bang it shut!
We do not believe it will serve the interests of justice to allow this defendant to go free on a token bail...
Your Honor, Mr. Kramer knows very well...
Given the emotions of the community... 
I have a petition from the community with an appeal to the District Attorney that justice be done. And Mr. Weiss himself has instructed me to request bail in the amount of $250,000. Cash. SPECTATORS (cheering and applauding) Yeah! Yeah! Tell him! Tell him! Tell him! JUDGE WHITE                              * If your office has information bearing upon the bail status of this case, I instruct you to make a formal application. Until then, I am releasing Mr. McCoy under a bond in the amount of $10,000. Now get this side show out of my court.

But to the cause of the people as well.

Your Honor...
No bail!   Put him in jail!
It was too much for me. All of it. Sherman McCoy had been swept away from me. Before I could even speak to him. And as the day progressed, I began to appreciate the power, the magnitude of the force that had been unleashed by my little story.
It's over! He's coming out!   Let's go! Let's go!
Jackels. Dogs. Yapping at the heels of their prey. And I was one of them. Well, let them have it. Enough is enough. I was finished. I summoned what little dignity I had left and decided to go home...
Excuse me, do you know where I can find a taxi?
Sherman McCoy. PETER Yes. I know.     I know that.   What are you...? SHERMAN I need a taxi.
You need to get out of here.
The other way! Other way! He's coming out the back! Move! Move! Move!
This way.   Come on.
Are you alright? SHERMAN Oh, fine.   Yes, thanks. PETER Look, I owe you an apology... SHERMAN No, you were very helpful. PETER You don't know who I am. SHERMAN That's alright. Thanks.     I should go. PETER Go where?

Take it easy.
I'm alright.
Yeah. SHERMAN I can't think.

They call me by my first name. Like they know me. Like they own me. Newspapers, lawyers, police, people I don't even know. How did I get to be so important? PETER You're not important. You're just dinner. You know what I mean? And a week from now, a month -- nobody is even going to remember what they ate.
I should have called the police right away, when it happened. But I couldn't you see? It wasn't really my decision.
How do you mean?
I mean, I wasn't driving the car. PETER What?! 
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Yes. But they always come back to the shit. Don't they? WOMAN And I always thought of you as such a dull person. MAN WITH PONYTAIL Sherman, has anybody talked to you about television?

What am I saying? Of course it's a bad time. But I just wanted to see if I can be of any help.
You know I haven't been in this apartment since the McCleods had it. That was before the Kittridges. I hope I'm not being out of place. SHERMAN Not at all... uh... SALLY Sally.
Anyway, thank you. SALLY No, really, anything I can do. With the apartment, is what I mean.
The apartment? SALLY I find people often need to be as liquid as they can in these situations and I know I can get you seven-and-a-half right at this moment. Fabled aristocratic tycoon -- it's the celebrity appeal. Maybe eight. If we act quickly this kind of opportunity doesn't come along every day. You have to ride the wave. SHERMAN Excuse me.   I have to... uh... Excuse me.

Sorry to interrupt your dinner.
Not at all.   The more the merrier. POLLARD I've been in touch with the co-op board, well, most of them, and we want you to know you have our support.
You know, at first I wanted to die. Standing there in court, people calling my name... POLLARD Yes.   Of course. Hard to believe. SHERMAN And then I thought, I have a gun. Twelve gauge. Double barrel... FOLLOW them INTO...
Here it is. POLLARD Sherman, we've known each other a long time. We went to Buckley together. My father knew your father. I speak as a friend. But also as president of the board. Is that a gun? SHERMAN I wonder if I can get both barrels into my mouth. That's what I was thinking. And how do you pull the trigger. I read somewhere about a man who took off his shoe and pulled the trigger with his toe.
Yes. This can't be a comfortable situation for you. 
Well...
This is my home... POLLARD I understand that... SHERMAN This is the only safe place I have. People are threatening my life. I have to protect myself. He loads the gun and fills his pockets with shells. POLLARD There are people demonstrating in front of our building. Black people with basketballs! You're putting everyone at risk. It's not your fault. But that doesn't alter the facts. FOLLOW Sherman and Pollard OUT of the study TO...
Alter the facts?! The facts are that I have no place else to go! And you want me to move out?! Is that what you're saying, Pollard. You want me to move out of my home?! The guests begin to listen to this exchange.
You are a shareholder in a cooperative. Look, we're not asking you to do anything of a permanent nature... 
And you can start by moving out of this apartment right now. Out! Now!
I came here in good faith.
Oh, Pollard, you were a ridiculous fat blowhard at Buckley and you're a ridiculous fat blowhard now. Everyone watches as Sherman holds Pollard at gunpoint and steers him out of the room. POLLARD I will have to enforce the provision concerning unacceptable situations. SHERMAN Another word out of you, Pollard, and there's going to be an unacceptable situation right up                          * your ass! Now march!                                     * The guests applaud.    Sherman turns to face them.
And that goes for the rest of you, too. Out. All of you.
Out! Stinking lot of anorexic parasites. Get out of my house! 
Out of my house, out of my life!

That same evening, just a few blocks away, I was being praised and congratulated. It should have been a very triumphant yours truly at Leicester's. But it wasn't.
... my little encounter with Sherman McCoy was spoiling everything. The truth has a way of doing that. 
He looks like a real killer, this                      * McCoy fellow. Doesn't he?                              *
You can see it in the photographs. You can see it in his chin.
Arrogant son a bitch, isn't he? I hope they throw the book at him.
Daddy.    Dinner. MOORE Yes, darling. Shall we have Peter here come along with us?
Lovely. Gerald and Evelyn lead Peter toward the back dining room.
I want to give this story our full attention, Peter. It makes us look better and better, the more we do for this Lamb family. Poor little Lambs, poor little fuzzy-wuzzy wogs. Caroline Heftshank intercepts them.     She is very drunk.
Excuse me, Peter. There's a phone call for you upstairs in the office.
Where's the phone? 
You don't deserve this, Peter. But I'm going to tell you something.                         * She reaches under her skirt and pulls off her panties. She drops them on the floor.
Listen, Caroline. I'm sort of with some people tonight. CAROLINE Relax, darling. Do you remember my pretty little Italian friend? The painter.
Yes. Yes, I do. Franco or Federico... CAROLINE Filippo.   The little shit. Caroline climbs up on the desk, lifts her skirt and sits down on the Xerox machine.
Caroline, you're absolutely soused.
Well, Filippo has run off with a little slut you should know about.                     *
PETER Caroline, isn't that dangerous? Or at least unsanitary? CAROLINE Shut up, Peter. You're not listening. Her name is Maria Ruskin.  
You're joking. CAROLINE I never joke.    She was in the car. PETER But how do you know all this?
The apartment was bugged. They had a wire in the intercom. They were trying to prove that I wasn't living there. Which I wasn't. Now I've lost the apartment and the boyfriend.
You don't know where they are? CAROLINE No. But I'm trusting you to find them. And when you do. Give them this. Tell them this is the little lady who turned them in. She takes one of the Xerox copies and hands it to Peter. Peter leaves. Caroline looks at the Xerox copy. CAROLINE Maybe I should advertise... 251   OMITTED                                                         251
Monsieur Ruskin is already here. 253   ANGLE - ARTHUR RUSKIN                                           253
Yes. We've never met but I'm a good friend of... your wife.
 My wife! My wife! I'm glad she's not here. Otherwise I couldn't have a drink.  Give me a Couvoisier V.S.O.P. No. Put it in a sidecar. PETER Yes.   Uh... where is Maria, by the way?
Italy. Every time I turn around, she's in Italy. I'm not supposed to drink. But I love a sidecar. It was Willi Nordhoff introduced me to them. So. You're on the City Light? PETER Uh, yes. And we're doing a little profile piece. We're calling it the 'New Tycoons.' And, naturally, we thought of you.
Good. Good. I like that. New tycoons. So what do you want to know? PETER Oh, there's no hurry. So Maria is in Italy. Where abouts?
She's in Lake Como someplace.
Well, there are some great hotels in Lake Como. Is she at the Excelsior?
I'd like to talk to her, too. If I could. If I could get in                        * touch with her...                                    * 
... But the best is just a few weeks ago, one of these jackass pilots, he lands long and the plane goes off the runway. I was there. I was on the plane. We're going into Mecca, see. And the plane is full of Arabs and all these animals -- sheep, goats, chickens. They won't travel without their animals. We had to put plastic in the cabins. You know, they urinate, they defecate... PETER Yes. ARTHUR Anyway, the plane goes off the runway and we hit the sand with a hell of a jolt and the right wing tip digs into the sand and the plane skids around in a circle! 360 degrees before we stop! We're scared shitless. Panic. And we look into the cabin and there's everybody calm, quiet, they're picking up their luggage and their animals and they're looking out the window at the little fire that started on the wing and they're waiting for the doors to open like nothing happened. And then it dawns on me. They think this is normal! He starts to laugh as he talks.
They think this is the way you stop an airplane.  
Excuse me.   Hello? Excuse me. Waiter!!! The Maitre d' approaches the table. PETER Mr. Ruskin seems to have suffered some kind of -- well, I don't know. MAITRE D'  Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
I think you'd better call someone.
 Freddy? Attention, s'il vous plait!
For your own protection and mine and my restaurant, we leave Monsieur Ruskin in the hands of God and we go back to our escargots. PETER Well, somebody has to do something. Peter tries to perform the Heimlich maneuver on Ruskin. MAITRE D' We have called the police. An ambulance is coming. There is nothing more we can do. Would you like some coffee or dessert?
 Gee, buddy. I think he's dead. Peter lets go of Ruskin.    Ruskin slides to the floor -- dead. MAITRE D' Eh, voila. PETER Jesus.
 L'addition, s'il vous plait.
What?
The bill, monsieur. Thank you. And we do not accept credit cards.
Mrs. Ruskin? MARIA Yes?
My name is Peter Fallow. I just wanted to offer my sympathy. MARIA  How very kind. Did you know Arthur? PETER Ah, well, yes. I was actually quite close to him when he died. MARIA I've reprobated myself over and over again for being away...
You shouldn't.
Well, thank you for the kind words. I must go now.
Yes. Just one other thing. I understand you're a friend of Sherman McCoy.
I'm sorry...? 
Sherman would never tell you that.
I was hoping you might tell me exactly what happened that night.
Look, Mr.... Mr.... PETER Fallow. MARIA ... Peckerhead. I am here for my husband's funeral. Understand? Now go away. Disappear. Disintegrate. She gets into the car.     Fallow watches the car pull away. He smiles. 259    OMITTED                                                        259 259A   EXT. HOSPITAL - NEWSSTAND - DAY                              259A
What kind of muckracking yellow journalist are you!? You print a story like this without so much as a by-your-leave to me or to Reverend Bacon here! Who the hell do you think you are.
So what?! So what?!   So what?! This is our case.
Right here. You see? It's the hospital that's the guilty party. PETER The hospital?! What are you talking about? FOX A young man comes in here with a cerebral concussion and they treat him for a broken wrist. That is our case! That is the lawsuit that we are going to bring against this hospital. That is what we have been working toward all this time. And you are confusing the issue! Do you understand me?!
Alright, alright. But Christ, Albert, this is a great story. This is my exclusive. And it's also the truth! BACON It's a little late for you to start telling the truth, isn't it, Pete? PETER I can't just drop this now.   I can't just let it go.
That's right. You're our boy, Peter. You take care of us and we'll take care of you. I promise you, that's going to be a very profitable relationship for all of us. Suddenly, Annie starts to weep.
Annie, I know that nothing can heal the wound that you have suffered. But ten million dollars in damages will certainly make your grief more comfortable. ANNIE Well, yes, I could use a few things, Reverend, thank you. I been worried about my clothes for instance. I feel that the presentation of my person should be carefully designed. As a model to black mothers everywhere, I think I should have the right wardrobe. So if you could have Mr. Fox's limousine pick me up in the morning, I could do some shopping.
Why certainly. ANNIE I'll need some furniture, too. And a new refrigerator. And although I should probably continue to live in that shithole of an apartment at least until after the lawsuit is settled, I would like to start looking now for a co-op in Manhattan -- for me and my son -- something with a view of the river and preferably in a neighborhood that is at least upwardly mobile. Pause as they all look at her.
How could I turn my back on the plight of this grief stricken woman? How could I turn my back on a 'profitable relationship'? I was touched to the depths of what was left of my soul... and my bank account. 260A   OMITTED                                                      260A thru                                                                thru 262A                                                                262A * 262B   INT.

That's us! That's me! That's Maria! How did you get this? 
 I suppose we could still go to the police. We could get a very talented lawyer...
 And put our heads right into the horse's mouth? I'm the one who was driving the car. Don't you think I'm the one who should make the decision? And I say, no. No, Sherman. Trust me. Killian switches off the machine. SHERMAN You mean the apartment was wired                           * -- bugged -- all that time?                                * KILLIAN Yeah.

KILLIAN No. It's an illegal      tape. Totally illegal. The guy who      did this could go to jail for     this. Now if this were your tape,     it would be legal. But it's not.
What do you mean, 'my tape'?
Well, if you were wired and you recorded your own conversation that would be okay. But there is no way that this tape can be used as evidence in a court of law.
Then what good is it?
An idea about what?
An idea about what to wear when you go to this funeral. SHERMAN What funeral? 263    OMITTED                                                          263
Sherman!   Whatever are you doing here? SHERMAN I'm sorry, Maria. I have to talk to you.
I see. Well, here we are, Sherman. The couple that all New York is talking about. And we're not even a couple anymore.
Oh, Sherman. Would I do that to you? Sherman, Sherman, Sherman. She embraces him, her hands moving toward the hidden recorder. Sherman takes both her hands and pulls them to his chest. MARIA What are we going to do with you?
You have to help me, Maria. MARIA But how can I help you? SHERMAN Well, I know this may sound like a strange request, but you could start by telling the police what really happened.
Oh, Sherman, you are the sweetest thing. But I'm not sure anybody knows what really happened. Not anymore. And if anybody does know, it certainly isn't me. SHERMAN But you were driving the car that night. MARIA Was I? I don't remember. Isn't it funny how a little thing like that can slip your mind?  God, there's something about funerals that is so stimulating. My panties have been wet all morning.

Nothing. MARIA Then why are you all hunched over? Her hands slide down his back.
Maria, we have to talk. MARIA Sherman, what's this on your back?
My what? 
You don't have a belt buckle in the back. There's some sort of subterfuge afoot here. Isn't there? SHERMAN Don't be silly.
You are secreting something on your body! SHERMAN Maria...
I want to see what it is. She rips open his shirt.
Maria, are you crazy! MARIA And a wire!    A wire! She pulls the wire. Sherman yelps in pain. As he spins around, Maria grabs the tapedeck and pulls it off his back. More pain. SHERMAN Eeeooowww!!!
