Her ponytail swept the floor.
You boys need to get your facts straight... she fucking lunged me.
You couldn't even remember who she was five minutes ago.
 I wouldn't mind if he did it discreetly, but he lunged her from about three feet.
 You can come along if you want.
 Yeah, I feel like it now, don't I... fucking hell...
 Get that, it's probably your viagra delivery.
Fuck off.
 Trevor.
Alright mate.
So come on, why are you back... really?
Because of the, erm, because of the party...
There's been hundreds of parties mate, what's so special about this one?
I dunno, I just wanted to see Shifty didn't I.
I was trying to bell you geezer, your phones off.
Yeah I know, mate?
Trevor, what do you want?
Mate, you haven't... you haven't paid me for last week yet?
Do me a favour, I've probably put your fucking kids through college, do you know what I mean?
Mate, keep your voice down.
Meet me at the top of the road by the telephone box.
Mate you're a fucking diamond.
For some reason... I dunno why... he still thinks of you as his best mate.
Why don't you try acting like one.
Trevor...
Yes mate...
Don't ever fucking come to my house again.
Yeah, no worries, I'm sorry, man.

Loves a wrong'un.
What happened to her face?
Apparently... Glen... I think... injected her with some fucking cocktail... I dunno... smack, I think... he passed out first... she passed out... but apparently she was lying up against a radiator... the fucking thing came on full whack. She was so out of it, she didn't even know it was on....

Do you understand me?
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
Yeah, yeah, it's cool, I'm sorry, man, I didn't know I had it on loud, I would have turned it down, I'm sorry.
Call me if you need any more weed.
 You don't miss a fucking trick.
You know it.
That was all a bit fucking surreal.
What d'you mean?
I can't believe you just sold crack to Miss Marple and struck a deal with Blazing Squad.
How old is she?
About 70.
She's been doing drugs longer than we've been alive.
Yeah, d'you reckon.
When did you start knocking out?
Knocking out what?
 Crack.
I dunno, about...three, three and a half years ago.
Why when d'you stop knocking out pills.
When do you think?
Do you get involved?
No.
Have you?
Fuck that.

Only if I get a fucking discount.
 I have to charge you wholesale, you know. I got family in Pakistan, they need ticket for plane travel, man.
Jasmine...
Where's the credit card?
What for?
I want to book a hire car.
We don't need one.
How are we gonna get about with two kids.
We'll get taxis.
It'll be cheaper to get a hire car.
Jasmine, we're not getting a hire car.
Don't ruin this for me, Trevor.
What do you mean?
Don't ruin this holiday for me.
Are you still there?
Yeah.
Where are you?
Where do you think. I'm on site.
It doesn't sound like it...

Babe, I've gotta go, Bob's calling me... we'll talk about it later... I'll call you...
Did you tell Rachel?

About me.
No, I didn't.
I thought it'd be a surprise.
Mate, it's gonna be fine.
Who else is gonna be there?
I dunno, lot of her new mates, I don't know many of them.
So what's the plan, are you gonna go and see your mum and dad first?
No.
You should go man, see what they've got to say?
I thought you worked in recruitment.
What?
When do you become a fucking family liaison?
What are you talking about you nutter, I was just saying?
I'll be stuck in some fucking warehouse... looking after twenty Bengalis... knocking out dodgy Fruit of the Looms.... I know exactly who they want me to meet, man.
It might not be, mate, it might be some sweet little earner... in the city somewhere, do you know what I mean.
I've got a sweet little earner.
Yeah, but you won't be sweating bullets everytime the door bell goes.
You're not knocking out weed anymore, man.... This aint college... you're in deep bruv... that shit'll put you down for life.
Only if you get caught, mate.

Yeah, yeah. D'you remember I told you he had that job at the pinnacles, the, erm, storage warehouse.
Yeah, go on.
Anyway, Craig tells me every Friday, on the fucking dot, a delivery gets made, all this top fucking electrical gear...
Cheers mate... yeah every Friday [lights his fag] they make this fucking drop off, but because the lorry can't reverse into the courtyard, something to do with the angle of the gates or something, I dunno mate, you'll have to ask Craig, they fucking, cos they can't get in, they leave all these crates sitting on the fucking road...
What... are you on your way there now?
What... no, no, no, I drummed the place ten minutes ago blood. This fucking... forklift went inside yeah, with this first load, so I, fucking, I nipped in, started whacking in the gear, only turns out they've got another forklift...
Hold up, hold up...Why are you running?
Cunt caught me right in the middle a loading up.
Are you sure you don't want anything, I'll do you a proper deal, sort you right out?
Follow me.

Mate, I'm telling you, this is no way to live.
I'm serious, mate, you need to get away from this shit, come and live with me for a bit.

Fuck you, Shifty. Fuck you, man.
Why, why, cos I'm speaking the truth. Talking about the past, talking about Serena. Oh no you can't talk about that, you mustn't talk about Serena.
Let's fucking talk about it. Let's talk about how you left two weeks after she died without saying goodbye to me, everyone fucking asking me what's going on, every one saying shit about you, bad mouthing you, let me tell you about the fights I had sticking up for you, the broken nose I got when some meathead slagged you off, let's fucking talk about that, mate.

You promised me you'd stopped, You swore on your baby daughter's life that you were clean, Trevor. You swore on our nine-month old baby daughter's life that you wouldn't touch that... that shit anymore.
No, don't you cry, don't you dare fucking cry, because to me that's even more repulsive. I want you to be a man for Christ's sake. I want you to be a fucking man about this, Trevor, for once in your life take control of the FUCKING situation.

Yeah, cool, I'll probably just grab my stuff from yours then.
As if I'm not gonna come with you nutter.
Fucking hell, man. I thought you were gonna leave me cold.
I thought you were used to it.
There's only so much one man can take.
Now you start throwing punches.
Loretta, is Glen there?
Shifty.
Alright mate.

I need to talk to you about something.
Can we do it inside.
 Mate, I'll only be a minute.
Alright mate.
Alright.
You alright Loretta.

What's going on, what are you fucking doing here?
Something happened today... something, I dunno, something serious... so I phoned Magnus... talked to him about it... told him what happened...
What Losing all his gear?
Who told you that?
Magnus did.
And what did he say?
That you've lost all his gear... all of his money.
Yeah well he went mental, saying some other shit about me cutting it up, mixing the coke, he was saying all sorts of... bullshit...
Why would he be saying that... who's been talking to him?
Dunno mate, you're guess is as good as mine.
Perhaps you should phone him up now, here, in front of me, tell him it's all bollocks.
You can tell him yourself.
Go on mate, call him up, tell him that I don't cut up the coke.
I don't know what the fuck you do Shifty?
I know that you bowl around this town like it's your fucking manor... with your smooth fucking Paki chat... giving it the large..
What are you talking about you prick?
Mugging off Magnus, saying that he's getting weak, losing all his gear...
What the FUCK are you going about.
And then you come to my house and you threaten me...
...Shooting off your fucking mouth, telling me what you're gonna do to Magnus... telling me how you're gonna take him down...
You've been chopping up the fucking gear all along. Selling half of it to the fucking Turks, cutting out Magnus.
Who told you that?
Fuck you.
Fuck you, you cunt. You're just jealous cos you didn't think of it first. You're not that fucking smart.
I didn't think of it, cos I'm not that fucking stupid.
Mate, can we go?
Don't worry about it, I'm fucking leaving.
It's about time you both fucked off.
Fuck off Glen.
After what happened.
No wonder you left mate.

Running off didn't help.
