Mummy!
Mummy!
Mummy!
It's Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .
Somebody's got to help us!
Sit!
"He wanted her to give him some money."
Put your hand up! I will not have girls talking out of turn in my class!
Good morning, gels.
Miss Waller . . . class . . . this is Juliet Hulme. Juliet is joining us from St. Margaret's, and prior to that she spent some time at Queenswood in the Hawkes Bay.
I am actually from England, Miss Stewart.
Of course . . . Juliet's father is Dr. Hulme, the Rector of the University.
Juliet's travelled all over the world, and I'm sure she'll be very eager to share her impressions of exotic lands across the seas with the gels of 3A. I'll leave you to it, Miss Waller. Juliet.
You can sit over here, Juliet.
We use French names in this class. You can choose your own.
Now, irregular verbs in the present subjunctive. . . "qu'il vienne". . .
Excuse me, Miss Waller . . . you've made a mistake.
"Je doutais qu'il vienne" is in fact the spoken subjunctive.
It is customary to stand when addressing a teacher . . . "Antoinette."
You should have written "vint."
Oh! I must have copied it incorrectly from my notes.
You don't have to apologise, Miss Waller. I found it frightfully difficult myself . . . until I got the hang of it.
Thank you, Juliet. Open your text-book to page 17.
Right, I thought we'd do some life drawing today. Pair off into twos and decide who wants to model and who wants to draw.
Oh, Juliet. . . you haven't got a partner.
That s all right, Mrs. Collins. I'm sure I can manage without one.
Pauline . . . are you with anybody?
Good! You can come here and pair up with Juliet.
You might want to change the colour- make it a bit darker . . . that's very nice, Joan.
Good heavens, Juliet! What on earth is this???
St. George and the Dragon.
Where's Pauline?
Oh, I haven't gotten around to drawing her yet. I was going to pop her on a rock, but I seem to have run out room.
Sorry! I don't know if you've noticed, Mrs. Collin but I've actually drawn St. George in the likeness of world's greatest tenor-Mario Lanza!
Yes, I know it's very clever, Juliet, but when I set you a topic, I expect you to follow it. Now put that down and start again!
I think your drawing's fantastic!
Oh! . . . Mackerel. We'll have them for lunch tomorrow.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
playfully shoves his hand away.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
Excuse me . . . would you mind if I put my long-playing record on?
You're partial to a nice bit of mackerel, aren't you, STEVE?
Well . . . actually, I'm not much of a fish man, Mr. Rieper.
glances at his album.
You have been splashing out!
Oh! . . . I've got my board money . . .
starts fishing in his pockets.
Hello!
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
Got an A, Mum!
glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
Don't worry about it now. We'll sort it out after dinner. You go put your record on.
Doris Day!
I think she's very talented!
Ya gotta be quick in this house, mate!
Hey! Isn't it that Irish singer . . . Murray O' Lanza?
He's Italian, Dad! The world's greatest tenor!
Stop it! You're spoiling it! Go away!
Can I have another look?
That's so impressive!
I've got scars . . . they're on my lungs.
I was in bed for months during the war, ravaged by respiratory illness.
Mummy and Daddy sent me to the Bahamas to recuperate. I didn't see them for five years-but we're together now and Mummy's promised they'll never leave me again.
standing over her, looking very concerned.
I spent ages in hospital, too . . . with my leg. I had to have all these operations.
Osteomyelitus turns your bones to chalk. It took them two years to drain all the muck out.
Cheer up! All the best people have bad chests and bone diseases! It's all frightfully romantic!
Hi, Paul!
0www!
The evil Prince Runnymeade is escaping! Get him, Paul!
The blighter's gone to ground!
God! Jonty! Jonty-stop it! Go away! We're not playing anymore . . . go on, bugger off!
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
It doesn't matter.
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
Mother!
Jonty broke Paul's record!
We must buy her another one!
No, thank you.
Which one shall we play?
Daddy can study while we're playing records!
Paul? Oh, God! Paul . . . are you all right?
I think I'm dying . . .
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
Paul!!!
Urrrgh! You've been eating onions.
You toad!

& JULIET "Her face is a dream, like an angel I saw . . .
& JULIET "But all that my darling can scream . . ."
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
But, we're all going to Heaven!
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
It's an absolute Paradise of music, art and enjoyment.
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
Saint Mario!
To be known as He!
He . . .
Him.
Him . . .
This.
This . . .
That.
That . . .
It.
Absolutely not! Orson Welles! The most hideous man alive!
We give praise to . . . the saints!
Hope it's all right. It's from Whitcomb and Tombs . . .
I decided that my New Year's resolution is to be more lenient with others.
Pikelets! Yum!
Aren't you going out?
Not till two-thirty . . .
This is a private function! Go away!
retreats, hurt and confused. HONORA brings in a plate of scones.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
Come on through.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
Look who I've found!
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
Hello, Juliet.
Hello, Mrs. Rieper . . . it's so nice to meet you.
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
They sound like a queer mob!
Dad!
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
She has deep discussions with unhappy couples and persuades them to have another go at it. In two years, she's only had four divorces. She should really be working for the U.N.!
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
What's that?
I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
and HERBERT exchange a glance.
Eat up, Yvonne.
It's my middle name.
smiles at Juliet.
Yvonne tells us you're good at making models.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
He's the manager!
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
This is the dining room . . .
Do excuse us.
Breakfast is between seven and nine . . . the bedroom's small, but it's very clean and comfortable.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
chuckles. Pauline and Juliet look at each with knowing smiles.
We have decided how sad it is for other people that they cannot appreciate our genius . . .
. . . but we hope the book will help them to do so a little, though no one could fully appreciate us.
Charles clutches his wounded shoulder as he gallops into the courtyard.
Deborah awaits his return in their private boudoir at the very top of the tower.
He smells her scent from 50 paces and urges his steed onward!
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
God, yes!
I bet she gets up the duff on their first night together!
Something you wouldn't understand.
You're eight and a half and incredibly stupid!
Mummy . . . Pauline and I have decided the Charles and Deborah are going to have a baby. An heir to the throne of Borovnia.
We're calling him Diello.
Paul thought it up.
Are you going abroad, Daddy?
You're not going, are you, Mummy?
But I should go, too!
But- Hilda suddenly stands.
Julie! Julie!
Look, Paul!
What?
It's so beautiful!
What???
Come with me.
Today Juliet and I discovered the key to the Fourth World. We have had it in our possession for about six months, but we only realised it on the day of the Death of Christ. We saw a gateway through the clouds. Everything was full of peace and bliss. We then realised we had the key . . .
We have an extra part of our brain which can appreciate the Fourth World. Only about 10 people have it. On two days every year we may use the key and look into that beautiful world which we have been lucky enough to be allowed to know of . . .
. . . on this Day of Finding the Key to the Way through the Clouds.
Push! . . . Breathe! . . . It's coming! . . . Oh, God!
It's a boy! Deborah . . . we've got a son and heir!
I shall call him Diello.
You're such an incredible woman.
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
. . . the Empress Deborah has the difficulty fending off her husband, who tries his way with her morning, noon and night . . .
NS  Thank you, Juliet!
. . . However, the Queen's biggest problem is her renegade child, Diello. He has proven to be an uncontrollable little brighter, who slaughters his nannies whenever the fancy takes him . . .
NS That's enough, Juliet!
NS I suppose this is your idea of a joke?
No, Mrs. STEVE ns.
NS I suppose you think it's witty and clever to mock the Royal Family . . . to poke fun a the Empire, with this . . . rubbish!
It's not rubbish!
NS Sit down, Pauline!
I really don't understand why you are upset, Mrs. STEVE n. I merely wrote an essay on the Royal Family as requested.
It doesn't say it has to be the Windsors!
NS  Sit down!
NS  A girl like you should be setting an example! To your seat!
NS Stop it, Juliet!
Mrs. Hulme told me they had found out today that Juliet has tuberculosis on one lung. Poor Julietta. I nearly fainted when I heard. I had a terrible job not to cry.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
Come on, sit up.
I'm not hungry.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
Juliet won't be allowed visitors for at least a couple of months.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?
You used to love making things with Dad, Yvonne.
This evening I had a brainwave: that Juliet and I should write to each other as Charles and Deborah.
I wrote a six-page letter as Charles and a two-page letter as Paul.
She has entered into the spirit of the thing greatly!
My dear Charles, I miss you and adore you in equal amounts and long for the day we will be reunited, but as I languish here, in this house of disease and decrepitude, my mind turns-with increasing frequency- to the problem of our son . . .
Although only 10, Diello has thus far killed 57 people and shows no desire to stop . . . it worries me, Charles.
My dearest darling Deborah. Affairs of state continue to occupy my time.
I have to report that the lower classes are terrifically dull.
Only yesterday I was compelled to execute several peasants just to alleviate the boredom . . .
. . . Diello insisted on coming along . . . in fact, he made such a fuss that I had to let him yield the ax himself. Heads did roll! Not just the prisoners, but the royal guard, my valet and several unfortunate copped it as well . . .
Oh, Charles . . . I am despair enough to put Diello in the hands of the Cardinal, in hope that a good dose of religion will set the young chap on the right path.
Yvonne!
I'm so happy to see you!
hurries over.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
Thank you so much!
That's coming along well!
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
I love the colour!
It's for you.
Goodness me! What a lot of letters. Are your parents enjoying their trip? Oh . . . there's a couple of unopened ones, dear.
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
gives her a sympathetic look.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
looks startled at the outburst.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
We've got a tram to catch, Yvonne.
Yes, but there's nothing between them. Deborah would never go for a commoner. Nicholas has got his eye on Gina, an amazingly beautiful gypsy.
Juliet made it!
Oh, yes! It's all worked out!
You'll never guess what's happened!!
What??
John has fallen in love with me!
That idiot boarder?
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
Is that why you haven't replied to my last letter?
No, silly. I'm just teasing. He's only a stupid boy!
Whaddya want?
Shut the door.
You should have worn your slippers.
Just for a minute.
To think that so much could happen in so little time, caused by so few. A terrible tragedy has occurred . . .
"Now, gels . . . it isn't ooo, it's eee," and she goes . . . "eeeeee" as if someone is jabbing a pin into her! Silly old trout!
And then in history, we've got this senile old bat, who goes . . .  God! It's no wonder I don't excel in history!
0f course, my darling Nicholas.
I like Nicholas much better!
What are you doing?
Bloody hell!
Go to the house.
You have broken my heart, Yvonne.
turns and leaves the room. Pauline stares at the ceiling.
I lay there mesmerised. It was just too frightful to believe . . .
When I got up I found Father had told Mother . . .
shakes his head, sullenly.
stands in the doorway.
John's no longer staying here.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
sighs.
Can I go now?
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
You think you're such a clever little madam! You had your father in tears last night!
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
Well, I guess I take after you then!
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
steps back.
You're going to be late.
I am terribly cut up. I miss Nicholas terrifically. Mother thinks I will have nothing more to do with him, but little she knows . . .
Nicholas was pleased that I was so early.
We sat around and talked for an hour and then went to bed. I declined the invitation at first, but he became very masterful and I had no option. I discovered that I had not lost my virginity on Thursday night. However, there is no doubt whatsoever that I have now . . .
Charles!
Deborah!
Diello!
Deborah!
I've got to go home.
There are living among two dutiful daughters.
Of a man who possesses two beautiful daughters,
You cannot know nor yet try to guess,/The sweet soothingness of their caress,
The outstanding genius of this pair is understood by few,/They are so rare. . .
Mummy!
Compared with these two, every man is a fool,/The world is most honoured that they should deign to rule,/And I worship the power of these lovely two,/ With that adoring love known to so few . . .
'Tis indeed a miracle, one must feel, That two such heavenly creatures are real,
Hatred burning bright in the brown eyes with enemies for fuel,
Icy scorn glitters in the gray eyes, contemptuous and cruel, Why are men such fools they will not realise,
The wisdom that is hidden behind those strange eyes.
And these wonderful people are you and I.
is standing, holding the door open, looking rather surprised at the unexpected visitor.
Yes, of course.
is pouring a drink.
Sure I can't tempt you to a nice sherry, Dr. Hulme?
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
frowns at Henry.
I'm not sure what you mean, Dr. Hulme.
What's she done???
Answer Dr. Bennett, Yvonne.
Yvonne!
leaves the room.
No.
She nags me.
No.
They're silly.
No!
looks up from her chair.
bustles in, and Dr. Bennett closes the door. Pauline sits down, folds her arms and stares blankly at a COUPLE OF SICK PATIENTS.
looks horrified.
But she's always been such a normal, happy child.
But what about the vomiting? She's lost a lot of weight . . .
Oh . . .
Mother woke me this morning and started lecturing me before I was properly awake, which I thought was somewhat unfair. She has brought up the worst possible threat now. She said that if my health did not prove I could never see the Hulmes again. The thought is too dreadful. Life would be unbearable without Deborah . . .
l wish I could die. This is not an idle or temporary impulse. I have decided over the last two or three weeks that it would be the best thing that could happen together, and the thought of death is not fearsome.
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
Is it hurting, dear?
Your leg . . . have you got pain?
My New Year's resolution is a far more selfish one than last year, so there is more probability of my keeping it. It is to make my motto: "Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you may be dead."
walks in, waving a letter.
This arrived today, Yvonne . . .
My name is Gina!
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
What does old Stew want?
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
Who cares!
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
I'm educating myself!
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
is very angry.
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
storms out of the room and slams the door.
I think I'm going crazy.
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
Let's go overseas . . .
You mean travel by ourselves?
Where shall we go? Not the Bahamas; it's bloody awful!
Of course! It's so obvious!
I know . . . I'll lean back and put my hair on my shoulders-then I'll look just like Veronica Lake!
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
Just a couple more . . .
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
I rose at 5:30 this morning and did housework before 8 o'clock, including taking Wendy her breakfast in bed. I feel very pleased with myself on the whole and also the future.
We are so brilliantly clever.
Direct hit! Gave his trousers a good soaking! Everyone will think he's peed himself!
Bloody Bill's sniffing around Mummy something chronic.
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
That was what we were led to believe . . .
I was looking forward to the ambulance arriving . . .
But it wasn't like that at all!
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
Poor Father . . .
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
Just washing my hair now, Laurie. Won't be a moment.
is walking past with an armful of washing.
Is she still in there?
Pauline . . . Come on, you've had enough time.
Yes, yes, yes!
You open up this door right now!
I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
Open this door!
Mother gave me a fearful along the usual strain.
I rang Deborah immediately as I had to tell someone sympathetic how I loathed Mother.
The balloon has gone up!
Don't try and fob me off! It's going to cost you a hundred pounds, or I'm blabbing to Daddy!
I don't care what you do! Pauline and I are going to Hollywood. They're desperately keen to sign us up. We're going to be film stars!
It's all arranged . . . we don't need your bloody hundred pounds anyway, so stick it up your bottom!
Deborah told me the stupendous news! I'm going out to Ilam as we have much to talk over.
Hello?
Deborah was still in bed when I arrived.
Dr. Hulme asked us to come into the lounge to have a talk with him.
The shock is too great to have penetrated my mind. It is so incredible. Poor Father. Dr. Hulme was absolutely kind and understanding . . .
He said we must tell him everything about our going to America. He was both hope-giving and depressing. We talked for a long time and Deborah and I were near tears by the time it was over.
What is to be the future now? We may all be going to Italy and dozens of other places, or not all. We none of us know where we are and a good deal depends on chance.
Dr. Hulme is the noblest and most wonderful person I have ever known of.
One thing Deborah and I are sticking to: through everything, we sink or swim together.
But Daddy, you can't just leave me with Mother!
Is Gina coming, too?
I'm not going to England without Gina!
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
You have to let me go!
stands and walks toward the door.
We'll talk about this when you've calmed down.
pauses at the door. Pauline is slowly rocking on the bed, staring at the wall.
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
Love, you can still write to each other.
softly touches Pauline's cheek. Pauline winces, averting her face.
Anger against Mother boiled up inside me as it is she who is one of the main obstacle in my path. Suddenly a means of ridding myself of this obstacle occurred to me. If she were to die . . .
Everything's going to be okay, Gina. Mr. Perry's promised to give me 50 pounds for my horse . . .
That's a hundred and twenty! It's another 30 pounds and we've got the fare!
It's no bloody good . . . I went to the passport office today. They won't give me one till I'm 20.
But that's not true! I've got one.
I need my sodding parents' consent.
Don't cry, Gina . . . We're not going to be separated. They can't make us . . . they can't!
Yvonne.
Please don't be like this, love.
I did not tell Deborah of my plans for removing Mother. I have made no decision yet as the last fate I wish to meet is one in a borstal. I am trying to think of some way.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
What now?
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
are sitting with Hilda in the lounge.
and HONORA exchange a glance.
shakes her head.
Yvonne hasn't spoken to me for nearly two weeks.
She's cut us out of her life . . . it's been causing her mother and I a lot of worry.
Is that a good idea?
looks at HONORA . . . tears are running down her cheeks. He stands and ushers Hilda toward the door.
Why don't I telephone you tonight, Mrs. Hulme?
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
breaks down into heavy sobs.
We realised why Deborah and I have such extraordinary telepathy and why people treat us and look at us the way they do. It is because we are MAD. We are both stark raving MAD!
Dr. Hulme is MAD, as MAD as a March hare!
It was the first time I had ever seen It. Deborah had always told me how hideous he was!
It is appalling. He is dreadful. I have never in my life seen anything in the same category of hideousness . . . but I adore him!
We talked for some time about It, getting ourselves more and more excited.
We enacted how each saint would make love in bed.
We spent a hectic night going through the saints. It was wonderful! Heavenly! Beautiful! And ours! We felt satisfied indeed. We have now learned the peace of the thing called Bliss, the joy of the thing called Sin.
I'm coming with you.
Yes . . .
I know what to do about mother.
We don't want to go to too much trouble . . . some sort of accident.
People die every day.
Our main idea for the day was to moider mother.
This notion is not a new one but this time it is a definite plan which we intend to carry out. We have worked it out carefully and are both thrilled by the idea. Naturally we feel a trifle nervous, but the pleasure of anticipation is great.
Only the best people fight against all obstacles . . .
. . . in pursuit of happiness.
We both spent last night having a simply wonderful time in every possible way.
sitting in the front of the car. They are driving home.
I was picked up at 2:00 P.M. I have been very sweet and good. I have worked out a little more of our plan. Peculiarly enough I have no qualms of conscience.
I rose late and helped Mother vigorously this morning. Deborah rang and we decided to use a rock in a stocking rather than a sandbag. We discussed the moider fully. I feel very keyed up as though I were planning a surprise party. Mother has fallen in with everything beautifully and the happy event is to take place tomorrow afternoon. So next time I write in this diary Mother will be dead. How odd-yet how pleasing.
Mummy!
Mummy!
I am writing a little of this up on the morning before the death. I felt very excited and the night-before-Christmas-ish last night. I am about to rise.
Mummy!
I will . . . I'm so looking forward to it!
Bye, Daddy . . . see you tonight.
Whoa . . . there s enough there to feed an army!
Hello!
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
Fruit.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
picks up the satchel. Pauline and Juliet tense up . . . as HONORA puts the satchel on a chair.
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
All right, then.
