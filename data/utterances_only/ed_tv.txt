You quit! You gave up!
 You quit!!
Qutters! ... Quitters!
And that would be it. I don't think you need any narration at all. Just end it right there.
 What do you think?
It's horrible, it's depressing, I love it. What else?
I want to re-pitch that pregnancy idea. Find six women early in their pregnancies and follow them all right through to the births.
 Yeah, when all that stuff comes out.
I have an idea.
This is something I've been thinking about for a long time. We're "Real TV" right? I mean that's the name of the station.
So let's go real. We find someone. Just a regular person, someone. And we put their life on television - live... all day long.
Calm down.
What do you mean, like PBS did in the seventies? What was that family?
The Louds.
Yeah.
No. We go way beyond that. We don't film it and edit it and put it on later. We go on the air live every morning and the show goes off each night, when our subject goes to bed. In between, we're on live all day, every day - the same person, -- for  let's say a month.
That's not a show that's a surveillance camera.
You can't do that.
The hell we can't. Look, the beauty of being a cable channel is we can take chances. I've thought about this and I'm telling you, I think this can make a noise. A loud one. There are twelve thousand channels. You've got to do something that says "Look at me!" Hell, people look at fish tanks all day. This is people!  Someone's real life -- an TV, all day long - live... And, you know what? I'm doing it.
In that case, we love it.
I want to congratulate Kevin and Tracy on their engagement. I knew you guys were meant for each other from the moment Tracy told us she was pregnant.
You asshole!
 What? What did I say?
My mother's going to see this!
What?
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
You said that.
We're falling behind.
You know who we are?
Tell me.
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Your brother's here.
What's up?
Where were you?
 I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
 Oooh!
I'm telling you, it's closing in on me. All of a sudden it's like a thing, it's a whole thing.
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
You know, those are for everybody.
Oh!  Show them that thing you can do.  This is great. I just found out she can do this, her brother told me.  Come on.
 I don't -
Come on...
Whoa!! Oh!
Is that unbelievable?
And that concludes today's show.  This is where you go around and collect the money.
Hi.
You guys know my roommate, Rita.
What's going on over there?
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
 Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
You know, that would be like a great thing.
What?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
What are you drunk?
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
What is?!
Show business.
You're in show business?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
 I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
Thumbsucker!
I'm making a tape.
We're excited.
So Ray met the family.
Yeah...
I hear the dog really liked him.
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
You shouldn't drink.
Jesus!
 And, you know, every guy I ever broke up with, the minute it was over, I could tell you what went wrong, how it went wrong, why it had to go wrong... but when I'm in it... lost. I'm like a love coroner. Bring me the corpse, I'11 tell you what killed it. But how to prevent it? Lost.
Ray's on.
 Hi. I'm Ray Pekurney. I'm from Paramus, New Jersey...
All my friends tell me "Ray, you've got too much personality for one guy." It's like at a party -- I'm at the center of the attention. Everybody loves me.
Ha, ha, ha. I'll kick your ass. No really, let me show you my girlfriend. She's really cute.
She's strong, 'cause she's a Fedex girl. She lifts those packages. But she's not dikey at all, she's really pretty.
Hello I'm Ed.
What smells?
What is that smell? Oop, I think it's this idea. One person on TV all day long?  Are you nuts?
Seriously, get your resumes in order. When my brother Ray - whose personality you were just dazzled by -- told me he was going to try out for this -- I said, "why in the world would anyone want to be on TV all day long, no privacy, everybody knowing your business, exposing every single detail of your life I mean... why would anyone want to do that? But then I thought of a reason...  Why the hell not?
Oh for -- Put those -- Oh God...
 We'11 take care of it.
 Here. This time throw it out, don't eat it.
Lou, can I talk to you a second?
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
I batted!
You batted or you bunted?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Well, then I'm quitting.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
 Who's in it?
Ed, telephone.
 Yeah... Are you serious? ... Come on, no kidding, who is this? ... Holy shit!
I had one year of college. And then one year of junior college.
What did you study?
Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
Well, there's Ray, my brother. He's... ambitious. Like a few years ago, he started this mobile dog-grooming business. But, like, out of his Camry. He had this bathtub in his trunk -  he's throwing the dogs in there, they're fighting and splashing, then he'd slam the trunk down, let 'em run around inside screaming getting all wet... then he'd use the car exhaust to dry'em.  Ah, Ray... he just can't get a break.
My sister -- Marcia, I mean she can't get a break. About seven years ago she falls in love with this Vietnamese guy who wants to marry her so he can stay in the country. So they get married, they have a kid, he gets his citizenship, immediately divorces my sister and marries this Vietnamese woman who, he was probably already married to all along. She can pick 'em.  She's got a nice little boy, though. My nephew, Andy.
My Mom's okay. Kinda. I knew a guy who hated his mother - Stuey Shwam. He hated his mother so much, he had his belly button removed.
No, I've never been married.
Oh, my father -what an asshole. When I was twelve, my mother needed a hysterectomy -- my father ran off with her nurse! And that's the last I heard of him.
Al, my stepfather he's opinionated. And you have to listen because he's like in a wheelchair.
I like my job -- I mean I'm doing all right. I'm not sure how long I want to stay there, you know... I mean, I'm thirty-one... I'm not sure I want to be a video store clerk when I'm forty... Of course, I didn't expect to be doing it 'til I was thirty-one, either. But... you know I'm... keeping my options open. Anything comes along, I'm ready to pounce. 
A dream? Of course I have a dream I just don't know what the hell it is. 
He's who we want to go with.
 This guy.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
Look it's not like we're burning up the airwaves now. We're running neck-and-neck with The Gardening Channel. If people just tune in to this twice a day for five minutes, we're a hit. Plus we can sell advertising every second, running at the bottom of the screen... and the beauty is this guy doesn't even have to be good. I mean if he's good, great. But if he winds up making an ass of himself, better.
How is that better?
Come on. People cannot turn away from an accident. You drive by, you say "Ooh, I hope there's not a head lying in the road" but you look ! See, nobody in America wants to be nobody. This guy wants to be famous. So, basically, the deal is he agrees to drive down the highway a hundred miles an hour blindfolded and we get to see if his head winds up rolling down the highway. Fun for the whole family. So let's do it.
 Good luck.
 Hey...
 Oh!
I got your message. Way to go!
Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
So when do you start?
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
What?
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
 Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
You would do this? You would actually --
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Why do you do that?
What?
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
 All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
I'm doing all right.
Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
Screw off.
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
I don't know.
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.
Oh. I -- I heard Ray yelling. 1 didn't mean to --
 Give me a chance. I'm begging you. I need a break. Look, I'11 cover your ass. I'11 ride shotgun. Just bring those cameras over to me and I'11 make something happen for both of us. I swear. Come on, Eddie
All right.
Yeah?!
Yeah.
 Is this guy a brother?!
What happens when you go to the bathroom? Do they go in with you?
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
What if--you're vomiting?
 What if I'm vomiting?
Do they show it?
I guess -- I don't -- it's all in the contract. There's this million-page contract --
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
 What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
 They're gonna mock our foibles.
Our what?
Our foibles, our foibles!
We don't have foibles.
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
Eddie, please don't let them mock our foibles.
 Stop saying foibles!
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
That's the point -- this could change things.
How?
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
 What does that have to do with... ?
If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
I borrow against that now, at the bank. Buy the business. And Ed becomes a silent partner. Now here's the beauty part. While we're on TV I plug the shit out of the business. Free advertising.
How about sex?
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
No! Do they show you having sex?
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
At what point?
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
Are you sure about this?
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
Why do it?
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Cream rinse?
 Dynamite.
So?
So maybe this is my dynamite.
Dynamite is dangerous.
Ed, can I see you a second.
 Excuse me.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
 Cool.
I want you to take this.
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
 Um, yeah -- thanks.
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
No, uh...
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
 Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
I do.
Oh.
Tomorrow morning, the cable channel known as Real TV, begins broadcasting one of the most heavily promoted concepts in the history of cable television. In an experiment that they say will last at least a month. They're going to follow -- live - every waking minute of a thirty-one year old video store clerk from Paramus New Jersey. The Real TV press release on this promises that none of it will be scripted, none of it will be edited and in my opinion, none of it will be interesting. we're all just supposed to sit in front of our TV's and watch this guy... live. 
 What would be the interest here? What would... get people to tune in?
Betas me.
I don't know. I might check it out.
Well, Len's here to check out sports. Len, would you watch this video clerk?
I'd sooner watch soccer.
Speaking of disasters, at the Meadowlands tonight...
Here we go. Ten-nine-eight-seven-
two... one.
 Well, we're off to a great start.
Oh, great.
Excuse me.
NOTE: Silent advertising runs along the bottom of the screen.
 Start clearing a place for your Emmy.
 Same people like to put the milk in first and then the cereal. I like to put in the milk first - I mean the cereal first and then the milk. Yeah, that's it. Now, watch this.
 So far...
Somebody shoot me.
Get him out of the house! I want him moving!
 Hey, I want him dead, but what can I do.
What... You want me to swim?
Oh God...
Oh, out? You want me to go out.
 Best pizza in New Jersey.
Hey, Lou.
 Welcome to work, Ed.
 Oh, Jesus, I'm dying.
Carlos, give him some air, give him some room. Use a longer lens. We'11 mostly go with the stationary cameras in here. Less intrusive. (to the crew in the truck, sarcastically) Have any of you thought about your next career?
Why are we watching this?
 No reason. just... I just want to see what happens.
Nothing's gonna happen. He's just... working.
Oh, come on, they wouldn't put it on if nothing was gonna happen.
I think he's cute.
Some guys work from the big toe down to the little toe. Not me. I save the big one for last. That's the one I really enjoy. It's thick, it's big, it's a challenge. Did you ever see old people's nails? (makes a disgusted noise)
This is not working.  Come to me!
 No, I haven't seen the spot ratings... 
 I think that's a number from which we can hopefully, uh... build...
I disagree... No, I am not ready to pull the plug... Yes, Mr. Scharlach, I know they shoot horses...  Look, it's been one day. Can I have a week with this and then have you fly up my nose?! 
The winner... Dashing Danny.
Next round's on me.
 Polish acrobat.
 Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
Go with the desperate brother.
Whoa, God bless Ray. First time I'm off-camera in two days. This is hard, you know? I'm, like, exhausted.
 He did that at my parents' house.
 Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
He is so wound up. He bought all new clothes for this.
Whew! 1 am kicking hairy ass!
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
 No. What happened?
 That's our sister.  She's got a new boyfriend.
Who?
He's living with her!
 Ray, maybe this isn't ...
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
Marcia's living with a singer?
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
He sang to her and they fell in love?
 No! Some drunk hit him over the head with his snifter -- you know, that thing they keep on the piano for tips -- and Marcia yanked a big hunk of glass out of his head. (cracks up, pounds the table)
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
Ray --
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Oh, Jesus.
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
What's the dif --
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
 She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
"Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Great.
 While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five.
You do though, you look great.
Right.
No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, "Boy Shari looks beautiful." I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.
Did you see that?
What?
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
You're nuts.
Okay, I'm nuts.
Give me the remote.
Just a few more minutes. Read your book.
What do you like about it? I don't understand.
I don't know -- it just it's I don't know. Just let me watch.
... my "Polish acrobat" remark was ill-considered. Although, I meant no harm, I should have recognized that such (trouble with the next word) stigmatizing remarks bring pain and anguish to...
I can't read my own writing. It's like Chinese --  It's not like Chinese! Chinese is, I'm sure, a beautiful language and they write ... beautifully. It's not Chinese.
Jesus, I'm sweating like a Mexican fruit-picker.  Oh, Christ!
 Can I have some room please?!
 Gi hu roo.
Let's change topics for a moment. Does anybody have a viewpoint on something going on now called "Ed TV".
Ray, don't throw the shrimp, you're gonna choke again.
Choke to death, you boring bastard.
The audience likes you when you're moving.
Yes. Try not to stay in one place too long. Get outside as much as you can.
Also, we have some notions. Have you thought about becoming a Big Brother?
Or coaching a Little League team?
How about a date?
Are you asking me?
No, I mean...
It's just, the ratings are still soft.
 Are you going to cancel me?
Let's not worry about that vet.
You're testing well.
There's another problem.
It's ... Ray.
What about Ray?
Well, the walrus impression - delightful as it was -- is just not wowing the audience. This is some audience research.
What does this mean?
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
He's just ... trying a little too hard --
Ed, the audience can smell the desperation coming through the screen.
Could you... see him a little less often?
How much less?
Never would be plenty.
I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him.
He'11 be fine.
What the --?!
I'm on TV! I'm on TV!
Ed! Your show stinks!
 This is Ray's apartment. Ray's got a big-screen TV and the Knicks are playing in L.A. tonight, so sometimes I come over after I work late and we watch the game here. He makes funny comments. He's really a good guy. He just...
Who is it?
It's me, Ed.
Hi.
You watching the ballgame?
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Yeah...
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
 Hi, Shari.
Who's Shari?
Who's --
Oh shit...
 Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
 We'd better go...
 No, honey, it's not what it looks like--
Oh God ... Ed!
That was Shari. She saw the whole thing on TV--
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
 It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
 Ray, I finished the Snapple.
Fine!
Is there more?
In the cabinet, but it's warm. There's ice in the tray. I  Talk to her.
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
Yes! Go!
Why me?
You brought the cameras here!
You brought the girl!
Please!
If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too.
That's good. She'11 -- you know control herself. Look. If I go over there, she's just gonna slam the door on me. Just go over and beg her to talk to me, that's all. Please. You owe me for this!
 Um... Shari knew you were coming over because she saw ...
Right, yeah --
 She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
I ... gave her a drink. I thought it ... but she's not much of a drinker, so it's made her a little... belligerent.
What do you want?!
 Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
Don't lose them, Carlos. This is gold. Stay out of their way, but get everything.
I'm gonna go to bed.  You okay?
Good night.
 Hi, Mom. 
Shari, Ray feels --
 Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
Ha!
Okay ...
 I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
Oh... how come?
Well, for one thing, he's a bad lay.
Oh my God.
 I mean bad.
Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
Look... whether you get back together or not, you're too terrific a person to... lower yourself like this.
I mean, I told Ray -- a couple of times -- that I thought you were one of the best and ... smartest and... most attractive women I've ever seen so...
Kiss him! Kiss him!
Really?
Yeah.
I'm nuts, hah?! I knew it! I said!
Oh, Jesus!
I found the Snapple.
Yes! Yes! I win! Scharlach, you schmuck! I am the golden goddess of television!
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
It's... okay
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Well, when you put it that way.
Leave. Go.
Can't we just --
Go!
 All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
I'm locked out.
Stay calm. Shoot the door. We're running sound. And we've got a camera in the street.
What are we doing?
I've got to tell you something. I have had a big thing for you for months.
Really?
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Really?
Oh God, this is so weird.
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
I'd better go.
Once more?
 Look. It's me.
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
Anything good?
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
 Yeah. Ma...
Eddie? ...
Yeah?
Are the TV people with you?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Send him away.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No.
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
No. It's a mess.
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
 This is my mother.
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
Hey, he cheated on her.
He made a mistake.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
No! And that girl has a name.
What do you love her or something?
 Come on...
 Look at your face. I had a car that color.
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
How's Marcia? She all right?
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
 Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
 Mm.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
 Oh my God!
I mean, that worked out.
Oh my God!!
 I think we're through here.
 I will. I'11 tell them.  That was Scharlach. All of you, scrub your asses. He's coming over to kiss them.
 Um, I'd like to get a new phone number, please... Because I'm getting calls from every nut case in America... Right, unlisted... Sure. 
Aren't you excited? He said he loved you on television!
He didn't say it. His stepfather said it.
 Well, the stepfather's cute... Seriously, how do you feel about Ed?
I think he's great. He just makes me feel... oh, I'm really gonna get hurt, this time - Hello ...
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
This is real, Bananahead!
So?
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
Hi.
... Ray?
Yeah.
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
I know.
Look, we gotta talk.
Save it.
Hey, you're that French guy on TV.
French guy?
Monsieur Bad-a-lay.
Let me just do what I came here to do.
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
 Cassie...
Go ahead.
This is really hard.
You promised me.
 I went out with Ray a few years ago for... a couple of months. And we... were intimate. And. he's really not as bad as that girl said he was.
I mean, I've definitely had worse.
That's enough.
 Good-bye, brother!
Ray, come an--
 So you're Ed.
Ed... we love you!
We're not going to be able to come over there for anymore midnight meetings. People are starting to watch your building. The interest level in you is soaring.
Soaring is good, right? I mean, that means you're not gonna cancel me, right?
 Man, he wants that balloon payment.
Huh?
Ed, why didn't you go over to see Shari today? That's what all our viewers were hoping you'd do.
Isn't she great? I mean, maybe just to me, but... I don't know, she's just --
 She's great, she's great. Why didn't you go see her?
I wanted to! I was dying to! But...
Is it Ray?  The audience hates Ray. Females, 18 to 35 --
No, I don't need to hear that. Cynthia?
Yes, Ed.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
Good idea.  Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
How you doing, Ed?
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
 Uh-huh?
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
Can I tell you something? I think you are fantastic. I think you have taken an idea and turned it into something explosive.
Yeah?
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
Sure.
A woman wants to be pursued.
This is so exciting! A real celebrity delivering my figs.
 Sign here, please.
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
By the X.
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
 Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
 By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
What are you doing?
I missed you.
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
Yeah, well...
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
The what?
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
Oh yeah.
It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?
 Look, I know this is weird. But... I don't want to wait. I really think we might have something together. Don't you?
Come on. Be my zamboni date.
Yeah?!
They tore her dress! ...
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
 Yeah?!
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Stand back -- I'm about to do my Happy Dance.
Well, welve had pet rocks, hula hoops, Davy Crockett, Beatle wigs, and leisure suits. But America's latest craze is a guy named Ed. Here with that story is entertainment reporter, Rick Douglas.
Pat, four weeks ago, no one in America had even heard of Ed Pekurny. Today, this thirty-one year-old video store clerk has become something of a national obsession. The words viewers use to describe him are "charming," "natural," and "appealing." And ratings indicate that "Ed TV" is being watched by more people, each day, than any show in the history of cable television.
This idea just came to me. I told my staff -- if people just tune in twice a day for five minutes we're a hit. Sometimes you gotta go with your gut feeling.
Sure it came to you! Because I brought it to you!  You want a gut feeling?! How about a groin feeling?! 
Ed TV has become so popular that when Ed goes to sleep Real TV is running highlights of Ed's day all night. Some viewers have become obsessed with Ed. They wake up when Ed wakes up, they go to sleep when Ed goes to sleep, and in between they try to watch as much of him as possible.
 Yeah, I watch it... More than I'd like to admit sometimes.
 Never... no...
Honestly? ... I try not to go to the bathroom until Ed goes to the bathroom so I won't miss anything.
I just kind of leave it an, you know, so it's... there.
I don't like Shari. She's ... needy.
I like her. She's sweet.
She just rubs me the wrong way.
I'm so glad they got rid of Ray. He was creepy.
To me, this Shari is like nothing.
She's not even hot. I mean Ed's a celebrity. If that was me, I'd be dating the goods.
There's something wrong with her. She's definitely not hot.
Not hot. Not.
What's wrong with her! Everytime you look at this chick, it's like she badly needs a Tampax. Ed, you can do better.
I'11 have...  Get this --  I'11 have the "Ed."
I'm stunned.
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
No problema.  You want a picture?
Moe.
Take this around the corner to Frame World, they'll give you a discount.
 Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
 That's lucky.
Saturday, I think we should
 Compliments of Motorola. Hello... Marcia??  My sister. -- What? ... What, right now? ... I'm eating, I'm on a date! ... Well, where's your boyfriend -- what's his name? Cliff .... Then, call a cab...  All right. Look, just don't start any trouble okay. Just sit there quietly 'til I get there... you're welcome.
This used to be a regular thing. And the worst part, is while she'd be waiting for me to come down to some bar and get her, she'd start up with some guy and say "Wait 'til my brother gets here, he'11 kick your ass." So then I walk in and there's some rhinoceros in a windbreaker who tries to shove me into a shot glass. And Marcia's drunk and screaming "Kick his ass, Ed. Kick his ass."  I think this is it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You're the guy on TV.
What was the tip-off? The enormous camera?
Watch this.
See, like you.
Yeah. Keep up the good work.
Oh great.
Ed.
What are you doing?
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
What's going on? Why did you want me to come down here?
Cliff is here. He's performing. I wanted you to see him.
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do with this. You swore to me. "Don't come near me. Don't bring this into my life..."
For God sakes, you said two words about some lousy pizza joint, the guy's a millionaire now. This could be my whole future we're talking about.  Hi, I'm Ed's sister.
 I've heard so much about you.
 I wish my stepfather was here.
Why?
He could give me some oxygen.
Oh boy! Here we go!
 Euuw...
Um...
What?
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
 I know, I ...
 Shari, I really like you...
 I really like you too...
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
... yeah, then, but...
So...?
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
That girl's an idiot.
What?... Why?
 I can't take it anymore...
 I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
Shari...
Everybody hates me!
No. Who?
Look at this.
Page three of the Post.
 Ohh...
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
Twenty-nine.
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
There's a list.
Really? 
Ed?
Wow...
I'm out here an hour a night and I feel like a dork. You're on every minute! Doesn't it just drive you nuts?
 Yeah.
All this fame and the money you're making. Is this going to change you, do you think?
God, I hope so.
You've got a ham in there and Dave's book and --
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
 Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
What?
No more calls, we have a winner.
Hi.
Hi.
It's all right.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Thanks... That's ...
You must be John.
I'm trying to remember.
 Well, I don't want to bother you, I'm just -- I was here auditioning for a skit. You know, one of those things where Dave goes around town with models and whatever...
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
V11 bet he goes out with her. It's like those actors -- as soon as they get famous -- Pfft - there goes the wife.
He'll never cheat on Shari!
You think she really likes him?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
You know what would be great?
What?
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.
What?
This is from a girl named Tawny... this goes in the nude picture pile. Thank you, Tawny.
Let's see.
Well. This is creative. This goes in the psychopath pile.
Oh, I hope that's not this guy. (indicates psycho letter)
Hello.
Hi.
You don't recognize me.
No. Am I supposed to?
It's me, Hank -- your father.
 Did you do this? Did you find him and get him to--
No way... Oh, this just keeps getting better.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
 Sign this one to Nancy. She's the nurse who handles my urine.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
Yes! ... practically
What do you mean practically? Did he really run away or did you throw him out like he says.
I need to replace the coil.
 He ran away after I threw him out.  How much is a new coil?
A hundred and fifty bucks.
So he was telling the truth you threw him out.
Should I go ahead?
Yes.
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Both.
Holy sh--
This one to Dr. Bamajian. Maybe he won't make me wait an hour.
He had girlfriends!
He says --
I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Who?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Yeah, so... ?
They celebrated the common person.
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
She could've been a nurse.
Could've been a nurse?
She had white shoes.
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
What's the difference?
The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
He was no good. Do you remember how he used to scream at me? You used to cover your ears with dinner rolls.
Also, no job was ever good enough for him. "Small potatoes, small potatoes." Al, you remember --
Wait a minute. I thought you didn't know Al, 'til after Dad left.
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al. (shakes Al by the shoulder) This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
Jeanette, you're hurting me.
 I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you...
 If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives -- (pointedly to his mother) or when I thought you came into our lives --
And what did he come back now for?
Who?
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
 What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
 Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?
No.
Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.
But he was your father.
 Hi... it's me, Ed. It's been two days, I want to see you... No, I won't let them follow me, I'11 sneak out... No it's not allowed, but I'm going for it... I'm on my way.
Hi.
They're not here.
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
So?
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's go.
Where?
Somewhere.
Do you want to go to a motel?
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
 Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
Okay.
Come on...
I need to talk.
Are you all right?
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
 Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
...yeah?
Good morning. Welcome to another day of Ed TV. Last night, while most of us were asleep ... this happened.
Yes!!
Get them away from me.
It's not their fault.
No. It's your fault.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
No... Could you?
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
The what?
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
What?
You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
Everybody's someone.
Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous.
Shari! Nice nipples.
And so are you.
I don't want to be famous for getting caught with my shirt off. If I'm going to be famous --
 This is going right up your ass.
Come on.
Look... maybe we just better put us on hold until this is over.
Come on! Loosen up.  See -- this is why seventy-one per cent of the people don't like you.
It was a joke! A... vicious, thoughtless stupid joke.
 And that, for you kids out there, is how you screw up a relationship.
 I'm gonna watch anything but me.
Coming in two weeks to the Lifestyle Channel -- Joma. His Dad's a cop, his brother's a bouncer in a topless bar, his sister is a black-belt social worker -- and Joma's living with two gals.
Hey, Ed! I'm coming to get you, man! I'm gonna eat you right up! (makes gobbling-up noises)
How did you get into my apartment?!
What is she holding?
 A pair of Ed's underwear.
Oh my God!
No -- keep it.
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
See -- that's television! This other thing, this Jama, that has "stink" written all over it.
The break-up with Shari was very big. Big ratings.
Only, Cynthia, seriously. Tell Ed not to sneak out anymore.
Cynthia ...
It's in violation of his contract and if we wanted to be hard-nosed about it, he could forfeit all pay, including money he's already received.
 I will see that he's properly threatened.
Now what? What's on the young man's agenda? We don't want to see him sitting around like a lovesick puppy.
Young males do not want to see Ed get back with Shari.
 Enough with her. That sailed.
Could Ed live with two girls?
You know who the audience is requesting a lot? That girl, Jill, that Ed met at the Letterman show. She really scored.
Cynthia...
 Oh. Ed.
Hi. Is Shari here?
No.
What is she, at work?
She left.
Well, when will she be back?
She won't.
What are you talking about?
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
She wouldn't tell me.
Remember when you were interviewing me? 
Yeah.
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
Great line.
What if Shari's the dream?
Ed, do you want my advice?
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
Leave her be.
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth.
Throw me a high one, Uncle Eddie.
Okay.
Oh!!
We have to stop meeting like this.
Hm?
Oh, hi.
Sorry.
 Did you arrange this?
 Whose dog is that?
 That's your dog.
Way to go, Ed!
You want to?
Um... It's kind of ...
Are you busy tomorrow night?
No.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
 Sure.
Oh man...
Hey, man. This is Haitian Love Juice.  You give her this, she be yours.
 Jesus!
 Good luck!
What's he doing?
He's buying wine!
 I'm starting to feel a little pressure.
Oh.
Can I help with anything?
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
What is? Oh, dinner!
Mm.
Good?
Mm.
Ed -- Ed -- Ed -- Ed...
 Someone say the word, how far can we go here?
Stay with them ... don't leave yet... not yet ...
 Ohhh...
Ed?
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Yeah. Why?
 So I guess you were all watching Ed last night.
This got the highest rating of the year, since the Super Bowl. I guess that makes sense. After all, Ed is now the Buffalo Bills of sex.
What?!
Take him off the air.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
 Good luck.
Look at this!
She did not!  You know what she did?
She went out to California and got one of those scandal agents. One of those agents who handle, like... Gennifer Flowers and... Kato Kaelin and Joey Buttafuco. That's what she --
Hey Ed! ... She was a little too much for you, huh? Must run in the family.
 Oh -- like this guy's ever been with a woman.  How about I kick your ass 'til the crack goes the other way?  All of a sudden, I'm like fair game for everyone. I'm like --
Oh my -- He wrote a book?! Ray wrote a book?! He never read a book!
Who is it?
It's Ed.
Ed! Come in -
How've you been?
They don't get cable here, so 1 can't watch you.
Sit down.
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
I was in jail.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
No. Two times.
What...
Check forging.
Oh, man! So...
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
 All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
Ed... I'm sorry.
 Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
What...
The pirate ship.
-- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
Do you still have it?
No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.
Let's hear from our guest panelist. You've expressed some interesting thoughts on this, subject. What do you see as the meaning, if there is any, of Ed TV, John.
I feel that Ed is the apotheosis of a prevailing American syndrome. It used to be that someone became famous because they were special. Now people are considered special just for being famous. Fame, itself, is now a moral good in this country. It's its own virtue.
I was Ed's Little League coach. He had no coordination. The big game, he struck cut with the bases loaded. Then he cried like a woman. It was sickening.
I was his third grade teacher. I said "Take him for tests. There's something wrong with him." They didn't listen.
He used to steal things from my store. At least I think it was him. Yeah, it was probably him.
Hey, look, I just fell off a table!
 Okay, is that funny?
 How was that? Was that funny?!
Of more concern than the sag in Ed's ratings is what viewers are feeling about him now. The positives are down and the negatives are up. There's a feeling that Ed isn't cool anymore. We're starting to see a big L.F.
Hm?
L.F.  Loser Factor.
That's deadly.
Not necessarily. I mean instead of running from the L.F., run with it. Create more moments like the table thing. We can package a video "Ed's Goofiest Moments." Let him be America's Goofball.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
Tad and Barry -- as we met them, originally -- are watching TV. They're really enjoying it -- laughing, pounding the table.
I don't know, I still love this guy.
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
You know it.
Ignore him.
I can't! It's like a mudslide. (screams out the window) Put on a shirt!
 I support the fact that your exercising but, for the love of God, put on a shirt.
 Shut the curtains.
No! Let him shut the curtains.
This Joma is so phoney! I mean, those things aren't really happening. I think they have writers making that stuff up for him. Hey, couldn't we do that? Hire some writers and have them write up some crazy situations I could get into?
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
 Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
 Ed --
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Ed --
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.
Look, you put anybody on TV sixteen hours a day, at some point they're going to wind up rolling off a table on to a cat. I mean with no privacy, there's no... dignity.
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
When? Today?
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Right, right...
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
 Right.
So he killed himself.
 Oh.
Hello.
Eddie...
Mom?
I'm at the hospital.
What's the matter?!
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Oh God. What hospital?
St. Joseph's.
I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
I told you! I told you he was gonna die!
Hi. I'm looking for my mother. Her name is --
Mr. Pekurny.
Yes?
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Thank you. Can I see her?
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Mm...  Oh, man...
EMPTY_LINE
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
Really? They were..
 According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
I ... don't know. I ...
Eddie. Thank God you're here.
How's your mother?
 Al!
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Al!!
Where is she? Is she all right?
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
Who?
Al!
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
 Good twist!
You thought it was me?
Yes!
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Went --
Dr. Geller, Dr. Stack wants to see you.
 Excuse me.
 Could I get your autograph for my niece?
 Um... yeah...
Al! How did you --
The Burkharts drove me. Are you all right?
 I'm fine. I ...
Good. I gotta pee.
 What happened?
It was horrible. He called me up.
Who?
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
So you had sex with him?
What?
The doctor said you were having sex.
 To you? In front of him?  With the...
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Oh my god! On TV!
Why? How...
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
But Al is your husband now!
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
"Lovely Rita, the Meter Maid...
 Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
 Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Women who remarry but have sex with their first husbands. on today's Oprah.
Ed's family is the tip of the iceberg. You watch the daytime tabloid shows it's the same thing. I'm telling you, America is fast becoming a trailer park.
Let's not overstate the case. There are millions of hard- working, sensible, moral, educated people in this country. Not every family is like Ed's.
So let's recap. The mother's too good at it, both brothers stink at it. (there's a drawing of a figure falling of a table) The stepfather can't do it at all and the father did it but it killed him. (there's a drawing of a tombstone) How did this family ever reproduce in the first place?
 You're not going to talk to me? You're not even gonna say hello?
I have nothing to say to you.
How are you doing? Is Cliff here?
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
Me?!
That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
 That's not funny!!
I'11 take it.
 Sweetheart, I'm gonna go ahead and sign all the papers.
Right.
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
I'm moving out.
What?!
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
 Oh, Al ... This is just...
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
I want to tell you something... I love you. You're my father.
I love you, too.
I'11 build a pirate ship with you.
Hi, Ma.
 Ed! How did you know I was here?
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
 Ma...
I'm a tramp (pulls on the sleeve of the man next to her) Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
 I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
I'11 take her. You humiliated our mother on national television. You've single- handedly destroyed this family.
I -- Oh, but that book you wrote was a real love-letter. That... toilet paper with covers.
That book sucked. I want my money back.
Oh great. Where's Moe?
Come on, Ma.
 Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
You know what your problem is?
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
Me?! That's you!
I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.
Right. Like you say you love Shari, but, you wouldn't mind noodling that model.
Moe!
The truth hurts.
Yeah? So does a kick in the nuts.
For once in your life, be honest with yourself. I know you, Ed. I know you look at me and Marcia and Mom and you think you're different. You're like "How did I end up in this family?" You're not different. you're worse. Because you have no guts. You drift around, you don't commit, you make fun of me -- okay. Just don't kid yourself.  Let's go.
You're both good boys.
Three more months?
Absolutely! Ed TV is more popular than ever. Congratulations.
Only, Ed, we want you, in the next few weeks to spend a lot more time with your family.
You do?
Definitely. Cynthia, explain it to him.
I'11 do it.  People want to see what happens to them now. Do your mother and step-father get back together? How does your sister handle being alone? Your feud with your brother.
In fact, we have a new concept. Since your family signed releases, we can follow them on camera even when you're not with them. We can cut around from family member to family member. Whoever's the most exciting at that moment.
And, of course, it's another big bonus payment for you.
A couple of years ago my Uncle Roy got bit on the ass by a dog.
So he gave me his tickets to the U.S. Open -- the tennis matches.
So me and Ray, we tell our friends "Watch when Andre Agassi is gonna serve for the first time. When he's bouncing the ball and it's real quiet, we'11 yell "Whoop". And you'11 all hear us."
I see. 
You know what that is? It's sad. I mean it was just so we could be heard. So we could stand out from the crowd for a second. So we did it. But we had nothing to say. Just "Whoop". That's it. And the stupid part  I mean the really stupid part is we thought it like... elevated us above the crowd. Where the fact is it made us stupider than the crowd.
I see.
Stop saying "I see." You don't see. Cynthia, I owe you an apology.
I don't think so.
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
 Ray, you were right. It's like in school. I was always saying "the room was too hot, the teacher didn't like me" -- but it was me! Everything that's wrong with my life I did. Okay? So now this is it. My family has problems. Which are our fault. And TV is not the place to solve them. So I quit. I'm taking what very little dignity I've got left and I quit. Can someone validate my parking?
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
No, I mean you can't quit.
I can't?
 Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
All right. Let them decide.
I'd like you all to do me a favor. Turn me off. Just grab the remote and change the channel. I mean, basically, all you're watching now is a guy deteriorate. The only thing missing is the smell. You're better than that Turn me off. Thank you.
Ratings are up across the board. Look at this!  Men 18 to 35, women 18 to 35 ...
This contract you signed? ... It's a masterpiece. Don't go to war with these guys. You fart in the wrong direction they can take everything you own and leave you naked by the side of the road. You ever going to get back with that Jill? Ooh -- she was nice. Shari, I didn't like that much ("imitates" a gabby girl) "yet-tet-tet-tet-tet-tet-tet."
Shut up.
1 bailed. I bailed on you.
Kinda'.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
What did you do to your hair?
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
It's nice.
I think this could be great. What if Ed and Shari decide to get married? A wedding? The cute, little half-Asian nephew in a tuxedo, carrying the ring on one of those big fluffy pillows - we'11 kill. A sixty share.
Um... Mr. Scharlach, um -- you're not watching TV?
No, Mildred, we're working.
Um... Ed -- and Shari are --
Engaged?
No. Here. They're in the building. They're on their way up.
Hi, kids. Busy?
I just came up to pass out these Ed TV hats.
A guy made these up for me. He spelled Ed with two D's. Okay, listen. The real reason I came up here -- and then I'11 get out of your way -- is I've been thinking about what you said. About let's start having more fun with this show, you know? Let's give it a big kick in the ass.
Well, we were thinking --
 Shut up.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
 What do we have to do?
My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV.
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV. (to the Honchos, excitedly) Hah?
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
Legal?! How can this be legal? It's defamation! It's slander! It's...
Not, technically. He is not showing a reckless disregard for the truth.
You're fired!
 Uh-huh... uh-huh... Really?! She was how old?
 He pays a prostitute to do what to him? I don't even want that on my shoes.
Stop laughing or you're fired.
Then she gets up.
Where are you going?
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
Okay. We have a winner. Now please don't feel badly if yours wasn't selected. In our eyes, you're all winners.
And each contestant gets one of these. (holds up a tee-shirt with writing on it) An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
Andy's available for executions. And the winner is ...
Hey, the winner is from right here in New York city. Carl Bowers a former orderly at the Martin Center -- a clinic that specializes in, what they call, male enhancement procedures.
 How many of you know what a penile implant is? As it was explained to me, what happens is--
And the man of the hour -- the executive with the winning secret the man who, thanks to the miracle of space-age science and a pump he keeps in his pocket, can now --
And that concludes Real TV's coverage of Ed TV. Stay tuned for new programming information.
A spokesperson for Real TV announced that Ed received a check covering his four months on the air, his balloon payment and an additional bonus to show the Network's appreciation for all his -- quote -- hard work and loyalty -- unquote. When asked --
In five years no one will even remember this person.
Five years! Six months. He's the "macarena." He's --
Marcia Pekurny, the woman known to most Americans as "Ed's sister" was married here today to Carlos Coto, who some of you may remember as the primary camera operator on "Ed TV" --
The current rage of "Reality Television" got a real dose of reality today. Lifestyle Televisions Joma was shot this evening, outside his apartment. Because Joma was on television twenty-four hours a day, Lifestyle's cameras were there to record the shooting.
Ohhhh!!! ... my ass! He shot me in the ass!
Now I'm famous.
I know him. I gave him an autograph.
