...did he have the flu...?
It can be documented that he displayed the...
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
There was a group of Girlscouts here from Indiana last month.  One of them expressed an interest in a Frederick Remington bust.  The president took her into the oval Office, for a period...
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
 Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Who's got the story? 
Don't you want to know if it's true?
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a story, and, it breaks they're gonna have to run with it -- How long've we got til it breaks?

It won't hold.
All I need is the one day.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
Trade Re1ations.
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
There is no B-2 Bomber,
That's what I'm telling you.  The two things:  the two things:  Rare strain of flu, No Cause to Be Alarmed.  And the B-2 Bomber...  Clear me a space.  Get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, Wash Post, N.Y. TIMES,

What do you think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean money ...
How much...?
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There is no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, Why?"  "In the Crisis."
What crisis?
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane right now to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the Boeing people.
 Do it...
 And you?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.

Dartmouth
Then show a little spunk.  There Is no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
It won't hold.
One day, Two days?  Course it's gonna hhhh....
ON BREAN AND AMES LOOKING ON. THE CLEANING PEOPLE NOTICE THEY ARE BEING WATCHED AND DISPERSE.
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to distract them for two weeks til the election.
What would do that...?
 What in the world would do that?
I'm working on it.

I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
What's it gonna cost? (HE SHRUGS AND STARTS TO ROLL OVER TO GO TO SLEEP.)
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
Who would find out?
...the... 
The American "people"?
Yes
Who's gonna tell'em.
...but...
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of Legos.
 ...you want us to go to War...
...that's the general idea.
Why?
Why not, what've they ever done for us...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber...
...they sound what?
Shifty.  Who knows anything about em...
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be quick, it's gotta be dramatic, you got to have an enemy.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Who?
Well, I'm working on it....
Albania...
Yes.
Why?
What do you know about them?
...nothing...
Precisely.
What did Albania ever do to us?
What did they ever do for us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
 ...you want us to go to War with Albania.
Here's what you got to do:  Get your Press Office, Right now.  To deny;  There is no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A.

DOWN AT THE DESERTED POOL AREA.  ONE NANNY TYPE, WITH A YOUNG KID IN WATERWINGS, FROLICKING IN THE WATER, AND BREAN, AND AMES, WHO ARE SITTING IN POOL CHAIRS.  BREAN RISES, AND WALKS TO GREET MOSS, LEAVING AMES IN THE B.G. TALKING ON A CELL PHONE.
ON MOSS AND BREAN, AS MOSS APPROACHES A BIT TENTATIVELY.
Do I know you?
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
And is it true?
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?
And you're here why...?
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
Party's gonna need more than a couple bucks now.
Back where I come from they call this Romeo in Joliet. (HE SHAKES HIS HEAD, REACHES ONTO A SMALL TABLE BEHIND HIM, AND PICKS UP A BOOK.) I, I, and y'know, I like the guy... he signed his book to me....
"For Progress to occur, it is necessary for Two Generations to Agree...."
Oh, jeez, this guy is fucked.
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO Shreds.
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want me to ...
 Allegations that the president had sexual... Ah... here is the deputy ... assistant under secretary...
I don't ... they're gonna tear this guy to shreds...
 ...the illness of the President, which we are assured, is not serious.  I repeat, it is not serious, the doctors suspect it's a stomach flu, but have advised him not to fly.  He will remain, on the ground, in China for, they estimate, one or two days, I stress that, during this time he will, of...

 Yes...?
 Mr. Levy...
 Yes
Would you comment on the rumors... on the rumors that the President's trip, that the President's delay... is due to the situation in Albania?
ON THE TELEVISION WE SEE SKLANSKY, AND SEE THAT HE IS THE CHAP IN THE BATHROBE WHOM BREAN GAVE THE ENVELOPE TO.
There, uh, I'm not aware of the situation to which you refer.
Sir:  the heads of the Albanian Desks at C.I.A., and at the National Security agency have been recalled on Special Alert, and there are rumors that the B-2 Bomber...
Mr. Sklansky, Mr. Sklansky, I am I am unaware of any, um, "situation..."  The B-2 Bomber?  The B-2 Bomber...?  There is no B-2 Bomber.  Mrs. Rose...
Mr. Levy, early this morning Major General William Scott flew to Seattle.  Is his trip connected with the B-2 Bomber?
Uh...Mrs. Rose, there, to the best of my knowledge, there is no...
Mr. Levy:  is the situation in Albania in any way connected with recent Muslim Fundamentalist, anti- American...
How close are you to this thing?
 What do you want the kid to say?
Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'
 Have the kid say I know we're all concerned for the President.  There will he an update on his condition at 5:45.
 ...no information whatever on Fundamentalist...  I.  I just want to say I know we're all conceroed for the President, there will be an update on his condition at five forty-five...

I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
I'm gonna tell you why...
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does that mean?
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...

Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
...uh ... No, that's...
We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking wars.  Y'know why.  Cause it's show business. That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, One Shot of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here.
AT THE POOL DESK. THE ATTENDANTS AND THE GUESTS ARE WATCHING THE TELEVISION. ON WHICH WE SEE COMIONTATOR TALKING ABOUT A MAP OF ALBANIA.
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and Posture.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
Why Albania?
Why not?
Pat? Pat?
...throw this shit out.  Gemme a pot of coffee and a packet of Camels.
But at some point they gotta know.
Who?
The... (HE GESTURES OUT OF HIS WINDOW, MEANING, "THE PUBLIC")
"They Got To Know?"  Stan...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk Driver.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The truth, I was in the building when they shot that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
Is that true?
How the fuck do we know.  You take my point?
 ...going to War...
It's not "war."  It is a Pageant.  It's a Pageant... Like the Oscars... why we came to you...
I never won an Oscar.
N'it's a crying shame.  But you staged the Oscars...
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
 You know, you're a writer, that's your script.  You're a director...  But if you're the producer ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the credit...  Some plaque on the wall...
And if you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
Hell, I'd just do it for the hell of having done it, for a story to tell...
Well, no, well, you couldn't tell any...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm kidding...  "It's a pageant"
...that's what it is.
 "The Country Is At War." 
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  Why Albania?
Because.
They got to have something that we want.
I'm sure they do.
What do we have that they want?
"Freedom."
Why would they want that?
They're Oppressed.
No, no, no.  Fuck Freedom.  No.  Fuck Freedom. They.... They Want... They Want To Destroy the Godless Satan of the United ... They want to destroy our Way of Life.  Okay, okay, okay, could we ... okay:  the President is in China.  He is dealing with a Dispatch of the B-2 Bomber to Albania.  Why? (HE SHRUGS, HOLDS UP HIS HANDS, TO SAY, "YOU TELL ME...")
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The Bomb, aaaand... No, No wait a second, no, no, wait a second, No.  The Bomb's not... it's not there -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a suitcase Bomb.  Ooookay.  It's a suitcase bomb, and it's .... in Canada!  Eh?  Albanian Terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada, in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA.
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's cost effective.  This is....
 It's producing.
No, this is great.
I could tell you stories:  Cecil B. Demille:  Alright? The Greatest Show on Earth:  He needs an elephant,
I have the White House on the Line.
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
 Ames here.  Yessir... 
Okay.  Okay.  The Suitcase Bomb...
...good title for a movie....
..."Terrorism," and an attempt to infiltrate...
...the Suitcase Bomb.  ACT ONE Albania denies it. President comes on the air, "Be Calm."  Okay, now: Good.  Now, Alright.  Act TWO...  I need the following here.  Right now:  Johnnie Green, Liz Butsky, and get me the Fad King.
Isn't Johnny Green in the... 
No, he's back in Nashville.
...who is this guy...?
 Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
We don't need an Act Two.
 And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
...it's a Teaser!
It's a teaser, absolutely right,
 The thinking is, as of this moment, Terrorism...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...
 Hello, King.  How the heck are you...?  Get out...  Get out... Well, man, you fall in love like a Hillbilly... (HE COVERS THE PHONE, EXPLAINING TO THOSE NEAR HIM) Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  Get your fat redneck ass out here, willya...
 ...but the President wonders about the Possible Albanian Backlash...
 You can't have a war without an enemy.
 No, King, I need you here yesterday...  How long do I need him for?
 Well, you could have one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're done in 10 days...
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
W...what?
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
"Back End" ... count on it.
 Lots n lotsa cash.  Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket 
 ...where is the Back End coming from?
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The Hostages...?
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring... (BREAN GIVES HIM A LOOK TO SAY, "OH, GROW UP") It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
In the yellow ribbon.
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from that...
 The Ribbon Manufacturers.
 King, King, I got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger back-end than Hattie McDaniel. Now:
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
 Here's what we want to do:  The Park Police, the Border Patrol, and the US Marshall's Service.  The D.E. the A.T.F, all of em, Stand by for instant mobilization, 'long the Canadian Border.  And tell 'em there's nothing to be alarmed about.
 ...went into a Convenience store...
THE GROUP, MOSS, BREAN AND THREE MORE, WATCHING THE TV
...asked if they had any girlscout cookies.  Five cops jumped on me, took me off in chains...
Ricky Jay, Ladies and Gentleman, Ricky, I guess we'd have to say that you're the most famous manipulator of small oblects in the World.
No, I'd have to say, that'd be the President.
 ...taking refuge behind the fact of distance, taking refuge behind the mention of Albania, of his stomach flu, taking refuge, with the election those scant days away, behind everything except avowal of his guilt. Mr. President, if you have any shame, I ask you, the public asks you, the electorate asks you to return, to face these terrible charges, to...
...from Airforce One.  In China.  The President of the United States.
My fellow Americans.  I apologize for the need for secrecy.  I assure you that had it not been necessary to ensure the safety of our men and women in the Combat Arms.  The Republic of Albania, long a staging ground for terrorists around the World, is in the procesa of mounting ... actions directed against the people of the United States.  In consultation with my advisors, I have elected to take the following precautionary measures:
It's a, it's a...  It can't be a ribbon...
Why can't it be a ribbon?
It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...
Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, Terror comes...
Keep Talking....

Uh...uh... Mounties.  The Mounties Guard The Border. uh... those Mountie Hats.

Does it have to be Albania?  Because, lookit:  I can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, I think, if it's Italy...Look at the tie-in here:  The Boot, "Givvem the Boot,"... If we were to go Wide with a shoe as the fad.  A "Shoe-fad"...  Here's what it offers us...
We're locked into Albania.
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
 The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
That a state of war has existed, between the United States, and...
Good morning, My name's Stanley Moss, I'll be your director this morning, what I'd like you to do, Miss, what is your name...
Trudy Larouche.
..."Trudy," is, to start at that wall...  and, on my signal, "action" to run toward me, screaming ...they taking care of you...?  Good.  You wanna cuppa tea?  Okay.  Can we just try one, just for the...
I understand this is going to be National?  Is that the case?  Because my agent didn't get a chance to...
Well, it's a little bit of a...
...we're going for a direct buy-out.
...you have your agent check with the...
No, I know it's going to be fine.  I'm so excited, and I'm looking forward to putting it on my resume.  When you called last...
Eh, Trudy, could I talk to you for a moment...?  You know, this project is a... "Funny" kind of...
 A schnauzer.  What appears to be a...
Lhasa Apso.
 Lhasa Apso, and a...
What you have here is a cross-breed, between a dog which was substantially a...
 Abso... absolutely, sir... Absolutely.  He wants a kitten. 
 Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
 I need a little bit of help...?
Miss, we are going to ask you to sign this little sheet of paper...
Well, my agent would be ril ril miffed with me, if I signed anything, uh, to...
This does not have to do with your Deal.  This is for your Security Clearance. 
 ...fix it in the mix.
We're going to do it digitally...
...can we shoot one?
Alright, now we're gonna...
...run with this...
...these'r potato chips...
Just, uh, just hold the bag when you run.
 We need it for the Arm Position, on the screen it'll be a kitten.
Someone's bringing in a kitten...?
No, no, no.... we'll punch in a kitten.  Um... Later.
...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
Yes. 
Why...?
Okay, settle, people.  Settle... we're gonna try one...
It gives us a wider option.
A wider option of what?
 ...of kittens...
...but, you know, all kidding aside.  When this goes National.... I get to put it on my resume.
 Actually, no.
Because, like, what is it, a Guild thing?  I mean, what, what, what could they do to me...
...someone would come to your house and kill you.  Hello... we're about to start shooting...
 Hey, hey, hey, she's ... will you?  She's just been raped by Terrorists, jump out, will you...
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...
Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
...gimme some flames...
...some sound of Screaming...?  ...whoo-aahh sirens?  Anne Frank?...
ON AMES AND BREAN, IN THE CONTROL ROOM.
...can we see the Kitten...?
 Hello... Yes.  We'll be back...?
We'll be back tonight.
 Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Waal, that's where you want em...
...I just hope...
 Do it again, love, will you...?  We'll tell you before we're going to shoot...
...could she be running across a bridge?  She's running across a Burning Bridge.
 ....beautiful.
 Of course, we're gonna need some water, uh...
Is it a stream, or is it a...
No, I think..
a "pond," or
No, I think it's ... can we see the calico kitten...?
 A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
 ...can we have a white one...?
 Can we have a white one, please...
 You know, if we're gonna run with the kitten, maybe it turns out, the Kitten has a Name, and...
We ready out there...?
 ...one moment...
 ...a state of War.  That a State of War...
 ...exists...
...between the United States and Republic of Albania,
BUSINESS PEOPLE QUEUING UP, AT THE TV, BEYOND THEM, THE DEPARTURE GATE, SHOWING A SIGN, AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT _____ TO WASHINGTON D.C. IN THE FOREGROUND, BREAN, ON A CELLPHONE, PAYS NO ATTENTION TO THE SCREEN, AS HE STANDS IN LINE.
 Go with a two-tone hat, I don't care, you work it out. You, well, I'm sure you've had similar problems in the past.  Good.  Good.  Keep me ppp... Fine, I'll call you from the plane.
Hell of a thing.  Hell of a thing.
Innit?
Albanian Terrorists on the Canadian Border.
 ...makes you think.
Ed, what do you think?
Bob, my mind wasn't one hundred percent made up,  but now  it is:  I say:  don't go changing Horses in Midstream...
FROM THE JETWAY THE DOOR ABOUT TO CLOSE, BREAN IN THE B.G. WATCHING THE INFOMERCIAL.  THE TICKET TAKER CALLS TO HIM, "...SIR...?"  BREAN TURNS AND RUSHES TO THE CLOSING DOOR.  ON THE TV, IN THE BG, WE SEE THE LOGO:  "RE-ELECT THE PRESIDENT.  THIS MESSAGE PAID FOR BY..." ET CETERA.
 It's workmanlike, what can I tell you.... no, it ain't going to help, but it won't hurt, cool down, see you in Nashville.
The issue of War, is, finally, an issue of Moral Fibre, Moral Fibre.  In my Platoon, in World War Two
 You have the number in D.C.?  Good.  What time tonight... What...? 
...wanted to go with Roman Numerals... but there isn't a Roman Numeral for Zero, so, you can't really do THREE OH THREE, in Roman...
 Why is this putz on the air...
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
...and I wanted to ask you if you thought it made sense that the uniforms of the Freedom fighters were starched.  I know that, traditionally, (SHE FLIPS A CARD AND WE SEE THE STARCHED UNIFORMED FREEDOM FIGHTER DRAWN BY HER) ...they're torn, and so forth:  days-in-the-mountains, so on, but I thought...
 Why am I seeing this guy on the News...?  What am I missing...?  What are we forgetting?
Well, at least we're not seeing the Girlscouts...
THE BUTTON READS, "FUCK ALBANIA"
AMES AND BREAN.
 ...is that "us"...?
Especially in a time of war.  Now: We said that Moral fibre, not guns, not supplies, not strategy, Moral...
 ...Senator...?
And this man, our President, in what I hope will be his last days in that office, has proved himself empty and devoid of...
TIGHT ON BREAN AND AMES, AND A FELLOW PASSENGER, AS ALL SCAN THEIR NEWSPAPERS. THE PASSENGER IS WAITING IN LINE TO USE A PAY PHONE.
 Can't find anything in here about the President and that girlscout.
...what are you talking about...  What does that mean now, are you nuts...?
 Hello, Honey.... NO.  I'm safe.  In about an hour. Have you got Grandma and the kids in...?  Well, where am I talking to you?  Well, who has the Shotgun?  Go Down in the Basement.  Well, get the long cord, and... isn't there a jack down there...  Well, move, the canned goods, and...
 ...hell of a price for the country to pay.
...take a long view.
...what's the Long View?
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
Yes.  That's true.  But...
 Wilfred.  We've got work to do...
BREAN, AND ANOTHER PASSENGER.
...what the hell's this all about, d'you think?
...small price to pay, pal...
...scared.  Sure we're scared.  But th'fella said the trick is not minding that it hurts.  N'Ill tell you one thing:  They might get into the U.S.A., but they'll have to get in over Mrs. Kelly's son... 
...dead and fifteen wounded in these first hours of the War.  They are not, they are not The Enemy, they are people, like You and Me, a different kind of Victim of Albanian Aggression, but Victims Nonetheless...
BREAN, GIVEN THE TOUR BY AMES.
Telexes to the major...
Missions into Albanian Airspace.  Missions to Kill or Die.  American Men, and, yes, and women, in the prime of their lives, but never closer to death, while...
 The sound of Freedom?  Yes, Perhaps the sound of Death... but....
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  No mention of the Girlscout. None.
Eight Days To Go 
I live for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
Big Bird touches down when?
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Anything at the Airport?
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
 I think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
 Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
 An Albanian, a young Albanian Girl.
No rain.
 A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...
And carrying.  The National Flower of Albania, something..... Now Is it some Festival?  Some Harvest Festival, something...
 Get on this, right now...
...got to be something.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
...this's good...
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
 Yes:  she is saying this in Albanian, but she's doing it not to be uh...  But because, she explains, that is the only way it can be understood by her Aged and Sainted Mother, who is standing there with her, dressed in her Traditional...
 C'n I get something to eat...?  Now the Old Broad starts to speak:  you are bringing peace.  Not only to This Land...
Our adopted land...
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
...uh huh...
Now, the Old Lady starts to Weep, Big Bird shrugs off his secret Service, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
 Find out is there any chance we can get some rain tomorrow, will you...?
 So forth...
How is Big Bird holding up, by the way?
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.
Knock on wood.
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
I dunno.... Ambassador to Togo, somethin', I dunno... he...
Maybe he's just a patriot.
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
How long you been up, you need a nap.
 Due in Nashville.
Nashville...?
We're gonna do the Team Song.
You're tired, Ronnie.
Y'wanna follow the Cattle Drive?  Sleep in the Winter. What does Moss want...?  Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family.  Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.  Now, Look:  I got the file, from the L.A. contingent, I got the day-by-day, of how...
 ...denial from the Albanian Government continues, but this tape, just in...
...just having heard her family shot.  For the crime of non-cooperation with Albanian Authorities.  Apparently, they had a family connection in Canada, along the US border and refused to exploit it to aid the Terrorists to infiltrate this country.  They paid with their lives.
...this is magnificent.
...Stanley Moss...
8 days and we bring it back home....
ON BREAN AND AMES SITTING AROUND. AMES LOOKS AT HIM INQUISITIVELY.
None of these are ours.  None of em are ours....  ....that's real politik, Buddy.
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
And if you think about it:  if you think about it, what Is war...?  What is war?  I mean, aside from the killing, and, all... that isn't so pleasant, ... you in the Service...? 
 ...and I'll tell you another thing.  President said to me:  When this thing... "happened."  "It looks like the Building's falling.  But, these are the times..." and I wish what he said, we could have used it on TV, and, as a matter of fact, we can, if we... (HE LOOKS AROUND, SEES BREAN STANDING BY THE DOOR.) Look here, here's an idea... Here's an idea...  Turn it on it's head.  If we're ahead in the polls, well, hell, this is the time to capitalize on it.  What do you think?  Get ahead of them, use the percentage points to push forward some of the long-term goals: housing, health-care ref...
Who might be the Boss Hog in this operation? 
Feel free to talk to me.
Cheezit-the-Cops.
 Ohmigod...
...awaiting the arrival of The President back on American Soil.  To still the fears, to answer the questions of this troubled land.  Here, along a border once considered more Imaginary than real, I'm Mike Stears, at latitude 45, along the Canadian Border.
BREAN LOOKS DOWN AT HIS WATCH.
...I just missed my plane.
You missed your plane?  My life is over.  My life is over.  What have you done to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
Well, keep your wits about you, and let's see if we can't...
...fourteen years...
...brazen-it-through...
Brazen it through?  Brazen it through?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the laundry --- do you know what we've ddd...
Do you know what we've done, for Godsake?  Do you know what you've....
No talking, please.
With seven days to go before the election, the Fortunes of President...
 ...took you long enough.
Found'em as quick as we could, sir.
When I'm done with'em, we want to dump'em in the District, or stick'em out in the country, have the F.B.I. trip over'em?
Legal department says You Pick Em.  Depends on how big of a splash you want to make, how long you want them to Go Away for.
 Oh, MiGod.
Guess who I am.
I'd like to mention a few names, who...
 I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose employ...
Quite touching.
And I take this opportunity to suggest that, equally, I admit to nothing, and that I would like my lawyer present.
Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there are no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania has no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.
 Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
N'who might you be, when all's said and done?
My name is Ronald Brean.
Who're you working for?
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
What are you interested in? 
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
 Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
And I think that the Security of the Country would be best-served by its citizens obeying its laws.  Gemme a Federal Judge, gemme search-warrants, all premises controlled by our friends, and bench-warrants for the two of...
 Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
I'm doing my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What is it you thought you were doing?
And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription medication, the side-effects of which...
I'm doing my job, Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.
 Thank you.
What's on your mind?
I have a question for you.
Ask it.
Why do people go to war?
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.
Why do they go to War?
To preserve their Way of Life.
Would you go to War to do that? 
I have.
Well, I have, too.  Would you do it again...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess so.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and Togo? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has passed.  It's passed.  It's over.  The War of the Future is Nuclear Terrorism.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own governments, have blah blah blah. And to go to that war, you've got to be prepared.  You have to be alert, and the public has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the future, and if you're not gearing up, to fight that war, eventually the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, this  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there ain't no war but ours. 
 It's just for eight more days.....
 One more thing, what is that river she's running across?
What?
...the young girl in the video, the Albanian Girl....
...she's running, it's some sacred... some ancestral land, cloven by the Brook named.... give it to Moss,
No, we're on top of it.
Thank you.
No, thank you...
 I should be in Nashville, tell him I'm coming in.
 (GESTURING TO THE YALIE, AND BODYGUARDS.) Nice enogh people... they just hadn't thought it through...
 No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... how long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to hand it to you.  They sure let us out of there easy....
 ...they just hadn't thought it through...
 Midst repeated denial from the Albanian Government. While, at the White House, a sense of Stillness pervades, awaiting the return of...
THE JEEP, AS BREAN SETTLES HIMSELF IN HE TURNS TO LOOK AT THE CHAOS IN THE PARKING LOT.
It ain't hoarding.  It's stockpiling.
Uh huh.
Only common sense.
 We got the guy, we got the guy, we got the Guy!
The Canada Thing was a shuck.  A shuck -- wasted a day. What can you do with Canada?  Bears, mapleleafs, "sugar -on-Snow."  Lays there on the plate like a lox.
AMES ON THE PHONE IN THE JEEP.
Yes... Hello...?  What...?  What...?  We're breaking up, I'll call you from the studio.
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, get this typed, get somebody to send it to the White House...
What is it?
President's speech.
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
No, no, no, no, no after the airport.
 Oh, shit...
...gotten word that the situation in Albania is resolved.  That it is resolved.  My military sources confirm that our troops, along the Canadian Border, And overseas are standing down, and I must take this opportunity to call upon our President to stand and face the charges, the heinous charges brought against him.  You know, folks, there is nothing in life as precious as the Innocence of a Child.  Nothing.  Now, I do not say these charges are true, I do not see how they could be.  Accusations of, of sexual misconduct in anyone, must be investigated.  In the case of a Sitting President, of one whose term, and I do not hesitate to mention it, ends, in, effectively, in a matter of days... I call upon the President...
What does he mean The Situation has Been Resolved?
He just got Hip to us.  He just ended the War.
What are we gonna do about it...?
We guard the Northern Borders. We live the Northern Liiiiifffe... We come to restore Order... For our Children and our Wiiiiiiiffee...
 Tell'em to knock it off.
What are we going to do?
 The War is Over.
What?
The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.
Oh, God...
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
...and the C.I.A. Confirms the cessation of Hostilities, with...
The C.I.A.
Oh, Lord....
...those limp-dick ... turncoat... I thought they let us out of there too easy.....
 War's over, Pal. 
 Gloria -- sell the House.  
The War ain't over. 
I saw it on TV.
The war ain't over til I say it's over.  This is my picture.  You think you're in a spot?  You think this is a tight spot?  Try making the Hunchback of Notre Dame when your three lead actors die, two weeks from the end of Principal Photography.  This is... this is... this is just...  Act One:  THE WAR. Act Two ... the... uh...
It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over.
You got a guy, doesn't believe the War is... NO NO NO. An American Serviceman... A brave American Serviceman, is Left Behind ... (HE LOOKS AT THE FAD KING, WHO IS MASSAGING HIS FOOT, HAVING TAKEN OFF HIS SHOE) He is Left Behind.  He is discarded like an Old Shoe...  Gemme the Pentagon.  List of people in all Military Special Programs.... Left behind.  Like the Old Shoe... Johnny: "Good Old Shoe"... 
Hello...?
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
...what do you got?
 Military Special Programs... Programs... No, I am not Shouting at you, I'm... I'm sorry.  Anyone named Shoe Schumann?  Schuster... uh
I got it!
"I guard the Northern Borders..." Okay, y'want to roll on another one...?
Naaa.  Fuck that.  Fuck that...

It's too clean.
Hold it a minute, Benny, willya?
It's too clean.
Let's take the bridge from nine, and the intro from one, and...
It's got to sound like an acetate recording, 1930.
Hold it a minute, Benny, we're going to tweak it a bit.  This may take a while.
 This is fantastic.
Y'like it?  Wait'll you get to the bridge...
This's Fantastic...
 Don't go with the bridge from nine, go with the bridge from eight.
Why eight?
Just try it.
A new take on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...

Hello?

He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care how many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with Gold.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for two hours... coming home with Gold.
 Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin Hats?  Here's my idea....
 I'll hold.

What'd ya think?
I think it's fine?
It's not too clean...
No, it's...  I'll, yes, I'm holding, but...  No, it's ...
Have identified the bridge, and the river from that tape.  It is a bridge over the river __________, ... what is it, Mayra, a "rhyme...?"
Actually, Bess, it's an ode, an ancient Albanian ode, praising the river, this particular river, the ________, as a source of peace.  It is ironic that....
 Hello --
 Look: I'm bringing in a tape, I need it copied AT ONCE onto an old acetate, and stuck in the Library of Congress.  Gotta Happen Today.
In the Folk Music Section.
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Ironic Bess, that while Peace is At Hand, the spectre of disgrace, unrest haunts the President, who, scant days from the Election...
...this the Guy.
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
Where is he now?
 Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
...we get our hands on him?
They got him standing by.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Who said, "I care not who writes a country's laws, so long as I can write its songs..."?  Stanley Moss, folks...
Hey, hey, I'm just the Producer, I'm just the Stationmaster, Johnny Green wrote that song, and...
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
No, I'm telling you, this guy, this guy is aces, this guy is the Kitty's Sleepwear, this guy, they should of given him every Oscar.  Every Oscar.  This is the...
 Well, this is genius.  Who did this?
My prop guy, had a guy out here.
 Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
Tonight, you remember some song, from your folksong days, something about a Good Old Shoe...
...tonight...
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
What if he's busy tonight?
Lure him. 
What are you saying...
Well, darlin' I ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  Now:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...

We wouldn't have him say the flippin' thing it wasn't corny.  Put... listen, it's not a question, we're locked in to this speech.  NO We're, Are You Listening?  LOCKED IN.  We're, we're playing way past it, we're past it -- it's the set-up for...he has got to say the speech.  Tell Ames to meet me at the West Gate in... (HE CHECKS HIS WATCH AND HANGS UP THE PHONE)
AT THE TV, MOSS IS WATCHING THE TELEVISION WHICH IS SHOWING THE "CHANGE HORSES CAMPAIGN."  WE SEE TWO KIDS WITH SOAPBOX RACERS.
 ...change it, but I said to my dad, "You Don't Change Horses in the Mid..."
 Can you believe this shit?
Yes.  Thank God, I say.  Thank God for the B-2 Bomber. Thank God for it, for it is not an engine of War, but an engine of Deterrence, as we've seen, and were it not for that deterrence, who is to say, but that American blood, would, even now...
 I was in the Vietnam Conflict, and I want to tell you that a man who could do what the President did -- I respect him.  But, on this issue....
AT THE DRIVETHROUGH PORTICO, AMES WAITING, WE SEE THE VAN, ON WHICH SOMEONE HAS SPRAYPAINTED "FUCK ALBANIA."
 Gemme all your secretaries, puttem in an office now, Would  you?  Would you do that?  Gimme thirty secretaries...

He thinks it's too...
First of all, we're locked in to it, secondly:

We've just received this photograph, of Schumann in captivity.  Held by a dissident, a renegade group of Albanian Terrorists.  I'm going to call your attention to something...I don't know how many of you know Morse Code...
BREAN, AND AMES, IN THE CORRIDOR.  PACING.  PAUSE.
You need this Schumann fellow?
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"...

"The Speech Won't Work..."

ON THE TELEVISION, THE PRESIDENT, IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the President of the United States.
Thank you, would you be seated, please.  Ladies and Gentlemen... I thank.  A merciful God.  And I am sure each and every one of us will thank that Supreme Power, whatever we conceive that power to be -- that peace is at hand.
CAIN LOOKS UP, AND WE SEE ON A VIDEOMONITOR, WHICH SHOWS A REARVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT, THE SAME TELEPROMPTER IMAGE HE SEES, WHICH READS: ...That peace is at hand... 
THE PRESIDENT, CONTINUIN TO SPEAK.
The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in contaot with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government credits his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and has not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making 
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
ON CAIN, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.
CAIN, AS SHE SMILES TO HERSELF.
ON THE PRESIDENT.  AS HE CONTINUES.
But that group has been, in the main, subdued.  Now: How did we come by this information?  And.  Who subdued that group? 
CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
It falls to me to reveal to you a secret.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and women, trained and pledged their strength, their skills, and, if called upon, their lives, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...
...anybcdy know Latin.
 ...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, Enemy Lines. 
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
And I can only say, to those family members, of group 303, which members are, I know, as I speak, gathering to comfort you, the parents of the missing man, I can only say,
I need a Latin Motto, anybody know n'y Latin...?
....and the Albanian Government joins with me, that no, I repeat, No effort will be apared, to find...
 ...this brave man and to bring him home.
Trump that, Senator Nole, you Howdy Doody vontz.
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
 Here's a photograph.  It is a photograph of a man. His name is William Schumann.  He is a Master Sergeant in the United States Army.  A member of the Squad 303....dropped behind Albanian Lines.  We've just received this photograph, of Schumann in Captivity. Held by a dissident group of Albanian Terrorists...Now, I don't know how many of you are familiar with the Morse Code...but...could you bring the camera closer in here, please...?
You will see his sweater is worn...it has been unraveled in places, and those places form dashes and dots.
THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in the Morse Code. And that message is, "Courage, Mom..." (PAUSE.  PRESIDENT PAUSES, AS IF ALL CHOKED UP) And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."  Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens I say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform you, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not treat him like an Old Shoe, we...
Trump that, Senator Nole, you Howdy-Doody-looking Vontz.
YOUNG PERSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT.
 ...we will not be swayed, will, will not be swayed from Every effort to find our Old Shoe, our...
 Hey...?
ON THE YOUNG MAN, AS HE TURNS.  WE SEE, BEHIND HIM, AN UNMADE BED, AND A YOUNG WOMAN, THE AIDE FROM THE SHOESTORE H.Q., WRAPPED IN A SHEET.
...wasn't there a folksong called "Old Shoe?"  Wasn't there an old, uh ..."folksong"...
It's all, you know ... thinking ahead.  Thinking Ahead.  That's what producing is.  It's like being a piumber.
Mmm...
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
Mmm.
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Yes, but I, well, you know...
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
...that's right.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Well, yes, but the guy did bring Peace.
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
All the greater accomplishment.
"Volo," meaning, "I will."  As the President bends all his will, to find, and to restore to his country, to his family, and to what are his mounting legion of friends, William Schumann, the Commando Ranger of detacment 3.0.3. -- Sgt. William Schumann...the Old Shoe.
 Hell of a thing... (HE LOOKS OUT OF WINDOW.  TO THE DRIVER) Stop there..
Ya got to hand it to the Fad King.
No, he's my Hero.
...these Shoes are ratty...
Yeah, well, that's why we're flinging them away...
RICH NEIGHBORHOOD.  SUBURBS NIGHT. WEALTHY LOOKING WHITE GUY OUT WAKING HIS DOG.  LIMO COMES UP BEHIND HIM. BREAN GETS OUT OF HIS CAR AND TAKES A CARDBOARD BOX OUT, AFTER HIM.  HE RUMMAGES THROUGH THE BOX.  FINDS A PAIR OF RATTY "SPERRY TOPSIDER," AND FLINGS THEM UP INTO THE TREE.

...was just discovered.  A l93O's recording, part of the folksong collection of the Library of Congress, and a fitting...
...and there's just one thing I'd like to say, and I am speaking to those in Albania who have the man in custody, and from the bottom of my heart:
ONE WORKER, WITH A T-SHIRT READING, "COURAGE, MOM," AND A PHOTO OF SCHUMANN, CHECKS HER WATCH, AND SWITCHES THE CHANNEL TO A NEWSCAST.
...the City Council, Denying the charges of...and this just in...the search for William Schumann continues. NATO, US, and Albanian Forces continue to scour the countryside, as...
ANOTHER SMALL GROUP OF WORKERS, SEVERAL WEARING, "FUCK ALBANIA" T-5HIRTS.  ONE

What about it?
For Schumann.
Well, well, well, well, wait a minute, we got 86 percent.  We bring'em back tomorrow, the charts go up, they don't go down...
I don't wanna tell them their business, but why not wait to give it to him after the election.  When he's gonna need some help....
King...
All part of the Service we Render.
 He ain't seen nothin' yet.
When do you bring'em back?  Schumann.
 Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
Where is he?
Out in Oklahoma.
Going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat.
See y'at the Finish Line.
Tell'em to fly the Inaugural Speech past me.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
I've come to feel It's my thing.  You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's just a job.  And then...
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
...isn't it?  Hey, what-the-hey ... it's all part of the bittersweet...
BREAN, MOSS, AND AMES, IN A SKYHOX, WATCHING THE SPECTACLE. BREAN SHAKES HIS HEAD IN SATISFACTION.
No business like it.
MOSS AND BREAN LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW.
 Rode the fifteen miles from the Bottomland, n'I was a- gonna switch him for a fresher one to do the Ropin'...
 Waal, but, you know, my Paw always said, Ya Don't Switch Horses...
Don't switch Horses.  Vote.  And vote for the man who brought peace to...
Fucking amateurs.  Pity of it is, two more days, we bring it all back home...
...knock wood...
And who's gonna know?  Who's gonna know what we did.  Who's gonna know...?
 Pride of a job-well-done...
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's more than that.
 ...mmm?
It's the gratitude of your party, and of your President...
Izzat the thing...
Indeed it is.
 Dean City, Oklahoma...  Army Special Programs -- tell'em to bring Schumann to the plane, n we'll bring him back, stash him the Hospital...Call the plane....tell me where to pick'm up.
I'll bet you're good at Chess.
I would be, I could remember how all the pieces move...
 ...aspect of the inaugural which.... No.  No, the thinking is, to Wait on the Congressional... hello?  We getting some.... hello?  Some interference...?
Little rough weather.
 To wait on the Congressional Medal for Schumann.  Moss and Brean think, and I agree, why spend it til you need it.  No.  Go ahead and pre... go ahead and prepare it. Sure.  Well, you... hello?  You can find the info on him in the Army Special... Hello?  The Army Special Programs.
We're seeing some difficult weather out of Oklahoma -- but the captain thinks that we'll be fine.
 Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties.  His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...
...we'll gettim in their cars.
 Yeah, we'll gettem in their cars.  I'm slowing down...  No, no.  Look, lookit:  I think it's a mistake, well, I'll tell you why:  you got'em by the balls, Squeeze.  Because Schumann's the Shark.  He's ...Jaws.  You have to tease'em... You don't puttem in the first reel of the movie...  Bring'em back slow, the President...  No, no, put him on.  Put him on.  President wants to reveal Scbumann before the election.
Big mistake.
 Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
 Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he might, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em vote for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying home, he's here, he's there... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you watch, ten bucks an hour.  If you help ... if you help, a hundred bucks an hour.
Hey, lcokit:  any business...
Ain't that the truth. 
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
What am I gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
 Well, I'll be damned if I know ... you know... doing this thing ...  You know what the worst word is, in the English Language?  It's retirement."  What the hell was I thinking of?  Hell, I used to...
"What have you got at the end of the day?  How do you keep those fears at bay?  What do you say, when there's nothin' to say?  Courage, Mom..." 
MOSS AND BREAN.
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and Lindy...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there is an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, as importantly:  Thank you for voting... 
 Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
Might, if I was asked... 
But, you know, this is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  This is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
ON BREAN, WHO IS DOODLING.
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
Of what?
The Albanian Campaign.
 ...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...
...The Albanian Campaign...
...like the sound of it, eh...
We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often now.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."
Wilfred, that's not bad.
That's not bad at all.
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
Napoleon said, fellow won't sell you his life, but he will trade it to you for a little piece of ribbon.
...the Albanian Campaign.  And we won't even be a footnote...
We were the Albanian campaign, John -- We Were There.
Gentlemen, little problematical weather.
Well, c'n we get him back home?
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
Well, they're protecting him well enough.
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  Isn't he...
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a Kingdom was lost...
You've got something, there...
 Napoleon said -- A man will not sell you his life...
MOSS AND BREAN.
...a masterpiece...
 ...givem what they want...But...
Weather's worsening, sir...might be advisable, wait it out, on the ground, till..
 We're due at Andrews. 
Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...

Let's fly, if it'll fly... People waiting for us...
 ...child at the airport...  breaks through the ranks, runs to "old shoe" -- should we have flower or a bear...?
Uh...Didn't we do this?
Never quit a winner.
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the Wheat. Variations include, the kid is a boy, the kid is twins, it's a little dog ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
 Uh...
 What's this...?
 Key to the manacles...
RUNNING AFTER HIM.
Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait...  What did he...what...what's the trouble?
No trouble at all.
What did he do...?
INT, THE PLANE, BREAN, LOOKING AT SCHUMANN.  HOLD.  MOSS ENTERS THE PLANE.
ON MOSS, AS HE MOVES TO HIS BRIEFCASE, AND EXTRACTS THE TELEPHONE-LIKE BOOK, HE TURNS TO THE FRONT PAGE, AND WE SEE THE TITLE IS "MILITARY SPECIAL PRISONS."
MOSS AND BREAN.  MOSS HANDS BREAN THE BOOK.  BREAN LOOKS.  TURNS TO MOSS.  AND THEN TO SCHUMANN.
...how ya doing?
Fine.
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."
Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
 He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
...twelve years.
Much more...uh, he have much more time to "serve?"
AMES  What'd he do?
He raped a nun. 
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...

And?  NO.  I don't wanna know.  What do you mean "and..."?
 Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.

He's not fine.
Yeah, Captain, uh, yeah, Captain, uh, y'better get us back to Washington.

THE VIAL OF PILLS, LABELLED, "MILITARY SPECIAL PRISONS," SCHUMANN, WILLIAM. A.  TWO PILLS EVERY FOUR HOURS.  SHOULD THE PATIENT BECOME VIOLENT THE DOSAGE CAN BE INCREASED TO... THE PILLS SPILL OUT OF THE FRAME.
THE PLANE, IN A VIOLENT RAINSTORM, BUCKING WILDLY.  AMES, ON HIS KNEES, GATHERING UP THE PILLS, REPLACES THEM IN THE VIAL, SHAKES OUT TWO, AND GIVES THEM TO SCHUMANN.  WHO TAKES THEM.  MOSS THEN STRAPS HIMSELF BACK IN AND BREAN CONTINUES TALKING ON THE TELEPHONE.

Oh Lord.  What have you done to me?  What have you done to me...?
Wilfred.
...what have you done to me...
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
...what are we going to do...?
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.
Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot more of this....
Well, get on the phone, and get it...
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the backstory -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of course he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of Course he's gonna "need a little help"... (GESTURES PUTTING A HYPODERMIC IN HIS ARM)
 Oh, Lord....

No, no, he didn't mean anything at all...

No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at all...
 Hello?   No, operator...
What the fuck did you mean, "What kind of stuff?"?

We're just, actually, we're friends of... can we get another pill into him...
Where are you taking me...?
 Hello...?
 Oh, Heck.
A BEATEN-UP BREAN STRUGGLES FROM THE PLANE, FINISHING A BOTTLE OF SCOTCH, HE FLINGS IT FROM HIM, REACHES IN HIS BACK POCKET, OPENS ANOTHER, AND, AS HE DOES SO, HE SINGS DRUNKENLY.
"Hush little baby, don't say a Word...Pappa's gonna buy you a Mockingbird, if that Mocking bird don't sing, Poppa's gonna buy you a diamond ring..."
...kid complains, kid cries, gets more junk, junk don't work, kid cries, gets more junk.  End of the song, house full of worthless junk, the kid's still crying. Story of America... (HE SITS ON THE GROUND AND OPENS THE NEW BOTTLE OF SCOTCH.) ...Z'at ever bother you...? (HE REACHES BACK INTO THE PLANE, AND BRINGS OUT A SMALL TELEVISION SET)
...what happened...?
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
How's our friend?
..."Courage.  Mom"...

What the hell do we care?
Eh?  I'm like the Rest of America.  I don't care -- I'm just addicted to it...
 N'just when everything was going so well...
THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS.  THE STILL BAND.  A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH.
How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"
Wake up.
Is he dead?
Is he dead?  Is he dead?  ARE YOU DEAD?  WAKE UP.  You stupid, nun- raping sonofoabitch.... wake up...  WAKE UP.  Do you want to spend the rest of your life in JAIL?  WAKE UP! Do You Know Who I AM???  I'm talking to you...

 This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when called upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.
BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.
...long overdue, its absence unexplained.
...this...regrettable absence... this ...tardy absence of the flight.  Must give us pause.  And, in that pause we should take time to examine ourselves, our plans, and our future.  There has been an ...interregnum -- if you will, of reason, while we've watched unfold this drama..... on the world scale...
 ...I hate this cocksucker...
And, now, end how it will, this drama is done...
The drama is done, and we must pause to consider.  And we must consider this man.  This man...who, you will remember, was discovered, scant days ago, in a situation which must debar him from Public Office... (HE HOLDS UP A SHOT OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE GIRLSCOUTS) And I say, when we take time to reflect, there're going to be a lot of apartments for rent in Washington, Election Day.  Two days from now, Folks...Don't forget to vote.
No, I didn't think so.
 Leav't alone.  Wha'd television ever do to you?  Ate your life, ruin'd your Culture, but...
IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.
Come on.
...where?
Come on.
Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY?  You follow me...?
Get on your feet, boy.
Uh huh...why?
We're going home.  We're going home together...
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you going...?
Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...
Just want to take a nap.
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, fatigued.  Let's get him to some help...

That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the ghettos...  Come on, Pal...
I'm tired.
Finish Strong!  Are you nuts? (HE STARTS SHEPHERDING THE TWO ACROSS THE VAST WHEATFIELD) Are you nuts?  This's Pennies from Heaven... on his triumphal return home, Old Shoe, his Plane Forced Down...AND YET...
He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
We'll deal with that when we come to it.  This is producing.  This is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles...
...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
Shot down, Forced down... (HE GESTURES, MEANING, THIS IS A MINOR POINT) You guys are missing it... You're missing the opportunity
Isn't it time for my Pill...?
This is producing.  This is, this is, this is the Beauty Part.  You've got your fortune right here, and you were ready to throw it away.  Because he's got a Problem?  F'it was easy, anyone would do it.  Otto Preminger.  Had to film a scene, in EXODUS.  The proclamation of the State of Israel.  Needed twenty thousand extras, n'Jerusalem Park.  Not enough money to pay'em.  What did he do?  What did he do?  Printed up signs:  Be in a movie, fifteen skekels.  He Charged'em -- had to turn'em away.  That's producing.  That's producing... n'you know, someday, people're gonna tell this story...
You can't tell this story.
Why not?
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
Ha ha.  No, no, not now, not now, of course, But Someday... when they tell this story...
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  You knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...

 Show some compassion.
... and he spent the last twelve years in a Milit&ry Prison... 
How do we explain that?
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
Fuck the world.  Try a ten A.M. pitch meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the material.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a pitch.  You see? His records say he was in prison ... as they must, as all the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the secrecy required of....
