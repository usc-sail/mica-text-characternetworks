Sandra.
My name is Sandra.
Shut the fuck up.
 Putcher dick away...
Get some.
 Eat shit please.
Can't say I didn't try...
Shit! Shit!
Suckage.
... what the...!
 My name's Tillman.
Counting down five... four... three... two...
We're cunt hair close -
All respect, Bob, nobody cares about dead Orientals... they care about Ken Castle -
Burger chili fry?
First... there was society...
The ultimate SIM environment - where players don't control virtual animated characters - but actual, living, breathing human beings.
 They walked them, they talked them. They juiced them...
They rocked them.
We all remember the slogan.
The creation of reclusive genius Ken Castle, society took the world by storm, becoming the number one guilty pleasure of billions, either playing or watching... and generating one of the world's largest private fortunes, surpassing Steve Jobs and Bill Gates practically overnight.
I ain't complainin'!
Nine months ago, Castle unveiled a new simulation - one that would take gaming to new heights of thrilling excess... and controversy - SLAYERS.
If society let us live thru others... SLAYERS would let us die thru others.
Slayers gives the gamer full control of a flesh and blood human being in full scale, kill-or-be- killed combat. And when we say flesh and blood, we mean flesh -
... and blood.
 Slayers.
Gina, when was the last time you saw someone volunteer to be murdered? I'm sure you know that every last one of our Slayers is a bona fide death row inmate -  ...each one offered a chance to participate as an alternative to their sentence. Stay alive for thirty sessions and get set free... that's not a bad God damned deal.
I'd remind your audience that Slayers was put together with the full cooperation and approval of the United States federal government... that the revenue it produces is responsible for funding our entire prison system - keeping the bad guys behind bars... and that the prop was voted for by a cock solid 68% of the American public.
 What'd he say?
There's a lot of men and women in prison that could never cut it as slayers... shouldn't they have the same opportunity to roll the dice for a ticket out? Besides - they only need to survive one session.
TO:
Simple.
It begins with a single nano-cell planted in the motor cortex of the brain -- this cell can replicate, replacing the cells `round it with perfect copies...
... these copied cells contain remote access functionality. Therefore, nano plus cortex equals the nanex.
 Did I? You know I seem to recall that - let's just see...
You like her? Her name is Gina. She's a good little bitch.
This motherfucker is off the charts.
 Why would he? 
That's fuckin scary.
Similar, yep. But control is strictly localized to the parameters of our gaming environments.
You take Society for instance: once a cast member leaves the workplace they are completely free from the control and monitoring of their player.
 To some, maybe... to some... don't you suspect a good many folks wouldn't mind an itty bit of control?
Someone else making all the decisions for you... no responsibilities, no tough choices... think about it.
Good little talk.
What the hell is that?
Ken Castle wants you to believe that you are living in a safer, better world. He's a liar. Mind control is slavery. We will all be his dog if we allow this evolution to continue.
Mr. Castle, we have no idea...
Shush!
That's a God damn hoot.
 Bypass orbital, reroute from the backup servers, NOW, for Christ sake, you dirty apes...  Sorry, Mr. Castle, we can't hard- line a live broadcast. It's impossible to stop every virus that sneaks in.
Uh huh. You might wanna oughta let my boys take a look at your firewall.
 What about your firewall, sugar - wonder if I might breach it one of these sunny days.
He's good.
Wanna blow off a little steam?
 Kable. Kable.
My name is Tillman, freak.
Tillmans, yeah, Tillmans, I knew that, they said you name's was Tillmans... just sittin, always sittin, always lookin, just lookin... like me, I keep my holes down... you got to, man... a dude inevitably start to break up, start to crack and break up everyday, never know you gonna die today or live another two, three. You never do know. All these niggaz gonna snap, snap, snap, one by one, every last one, all of em. Yeah but not you. Twenty seven battles and three to go... no one ever got that close before, no one even done ten games without gettin they brains shot... but Kable, Kable, Kable, he just sittin, lookin, like he got a plan, he already somewhere else, he on a mission, nothin' get in his way, never break, never snap, never say shit, just take care of his business, niggaz get spooked by that shit. You spooky.
Spooky.
Why they put you in here, Tillmans?
I killed my best friend.
Master! Master! Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings - Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams...
You want to get back to them.
It's all you think about. It's the only thing that keeps you alive.
Who's talking?
Sign it.
What?
Sign it... please, Tillman. My son David is your biggest fan. He prays for you.
Need to prove it's authentic. Makes it worth more.
Why would anyone want my name?
You don't even know what's going on out there, do you?  Damn...
Gotta go.
Wait. (he holds the wrinkled photo to the window) How did you get this picture?            Have you seen them?
Damn, I gonna have to eat you now, son.
Oh shit... oh shit...
Wul hello thar...
Wait for it...
 Turn me around God damn it...
What'd he say?
My boy gotta take a piss or something?
D'oh.
Who are they... who the fuck are they... who's playing us?
Gay... gay... gay... super gay... hm.
Swarmers. The latest innovation from Browning, this self detonating cartridge offers the widest and deadliest spray available from a full tracking, cornering ordnance.
Daddy like...
Simon!
Fan-girl, stop hacking. If I want you unmuted I'll unmute you.
You suck, Simon - you're going to get my boyfriend killed before he can get out of jail and fill me up with his hot seed.
Uh huh.
Shut up bitch.
What is that?  Aaaa.
Woah.
What's up, loser?
Hey sissy.
Mom says - let me see, go to college, move the fuck out, and... oh yeah, you're a sick retard, you're pathetic, and you smell like Jeffrey Dahmer.
Wanna make out?
You wish. I can't wait til they cut you off, Simian.
Simon?
Maybe.
 Oh my god, it's really you!!!
Nice.
 Do you wanna see our tits, Simon?
 Uh, sure.
Mmmmm, now that we have your attention, here's another offer you can't refuse.
Here we go.
Fifty million euros for control of Kable, instant transfer to the account of your choice.
Question: do I look like I need the money? We've discussed this before - Kable is not for sale.
 Baby... make it a hundred.
It's been real.
D'oh.
What the fuh...?
SIMON Um.
Hey.
Hi.
Hi.
So what's your damage?
You know, just hanging out.  Looking to meet people.
Lucky you...
You met me.
 You met me.
I'm Nika.
I'm Dale.  I like your fur.
Do you want to go somewhere?
We are somewhere.
Thanks for vagina.
Don't cry for Castle, he can cover that with the change under his couch cushions...
Oh - I literally pissed myself.
Serious, these humanz cocksuckers are getting out of control, and someone should do something.
GET IT OUT OF ME...!
What the hell happened to this one?
Look like he escaped.
Back to your Jazzercise, girls...
Freak.
Tillmans.
Who the hell is that?
New dude, new dude... that's Hackman. They say he killed a whole mess of people, all kind of people... one day he just walk up and turn himself in, like he wanna be inside or some shit... never gonna run out of slayers long as they got that kind of motherfucka run around kill a mess of people...
Hey Kable.
Let's go. Upgrades.
Who aims?
 What?
Who aims... the slayer? Or the player?
Not much to aiming... it's just hand/eye coordination. I'm the hand... someone, somewhere else is the eye.
That's tripped.
Sometimes... they take over - you know, completely. They move you. Like a robot.  But it doesn't work so good... that part's just for show. You can't really fight that way.
Why?
There's a delay...
Yeah, the ping... they talk about that. The time it takes the slayer to respond to the command... it's like, five millisecond ping, eight millisecond ping...
Whatever you call it. A slice of a second is the difference between living and dying out there. When the trigger pulls -
It's just me.
Hey. Kable.
Not interested.
No. Wait. Look.
I just deleted someone.
This is the blood. Look.
He's back here. Want to see?
Your head ain't on straight.
I'm going to delete you too. On Sunday.
Yeah, probably.
That's why they put me here.
I've got no strings... So I have fun... I'm not tied up to anyone... They've got strings But you can see There are no strings on me...
You got two whores, Kable...
- the fuck did you say?
On the outside... oh, I'm sorry - I meant your pretty girls... You want to get back to them but I'm going to visit them first...
He's so perfect.
He's scary.
Yeah...
 The new face of Slayers. Pure crystallized horror, two stories tall and covered in bloody red...  He's so what they want.
 But they love Kable.
He's right.
 They do now. But when my boy kills their hero right there in front of their eyeballs, so vivid it's like you can reach out and feel the wet flesh - Trust me, they'll change their point of view.
How can you be sure?
It's human nature. They'll be seduced by the power, the violence... the dominance...
 Guess we never figured on Kable blowing up as big as he did.
Bigger than the game? No. Then again, who ever would've imagined a player could last over a dozen sessions with the same I-con...
Tillman is a perfect soldier, a tactical killing computer - you dropped him in with common murderers. What did you expect?
 His instincts give him an edge.
And in the hands of a talented player...
Of course we can never let him out. Not after what we did to him.
Tell me again why we don't just get rid of the problem... (makes a throat slashing motion) You know, off camera?
YOU - lack a flair for marketing. The people would never accept that. They need to SEE their gladiators brought down.
One thing I know is what makes people tick.
Kable, dude. It's me.
Who?
Simon.  I'm playing you, dummy.
How come I can hear you?
It's a mod.
Gamers can't talk to cons.
I know.
It's cool, yeah?
No. Pay attention to the game.
That was sick.
Wait a minute... are you twelve?
I'm nineteen.
Bullshit. This is unbelievable. How am I not dead yet?
Cause I'm a badass motherfucker.
 Gotta keep my holes down... keep `em down. Freek's gonna make it, gonna cut, gonna scatter... gonna burn this joint...
Gibs.
What?
Like, giblets. Kibbles and bits. Chunks. Pieces.
 These are real humans, fucker.
Death row psychos, so what?          They had it coming.
Guess that goes for me too.
Yeah, but you're different.
Different how?
Dude, I don't know. Cause you're MY psycho.
Damn, new area.
That way.
Think about it, Kable: all the shit we've been through together. What an epic run.  It's going to suck to see it end.
Are you kidding me?
Well, yeah - I get that for you it's different.
We should go that way.
There's nothing there.
Kid, trust me - I was going house to house in Tehran while you were still sucking mommy's nipple.
 Uh, yeah dude, thanks for the visual, but it's a restricted area. It's beyond the borders of the game. I couldn't put you there if I tried.
... shit shit shit!
 Bye Kable.
What happened?
 Kid's gonna get me killed.
 Hey.
Listen to me. I don't know who's behind it, or why, but I was supposed to die today. They're gunning for us. I can beat them, but not with you controlling me.
What the hell...?
Turn me loose, kid.        You want to win, turn me loose.
But-
Find a way.
And then: ORDER NOW!
 So... Miss Roth.
Why are we here today... says you'd like to apply for custody of your child-
Delia.   Her name is Delia.
Spouse incarcerated, life without possibility of parole. You use your maiden name.
My husband - he... it's not entirely true, regarding his sentence. In fact, he's due to be released soon...
Your husband was charged and convicted of first degree murder, Miss Roth. I can hardly consider his release, if it was to occur, to be a positive.
 You're... an actor?
Not sure if I've seen you in anything.
I work in society.
Acting, is that what they call it?
It's a job.
Miss Roth. Your child has been... exceedingly well placed. The new family is very wealthy. She'll never want for anything.  I understand you love your little girl, but... do you really think she'd be better off with people like you?
Yes, I do.     I'm her mother.
We will give your application all the consideration that it merits.
You like the software?
 Software...
The walkie talkie, playa.
No shit... you're the guy from TV. The HUMANZ.
That's right, baby. You think about what the brotha said?
To what, um, brotha do you refer... brotha?
Kable wants the freedom to ass- kick. Do shit his way. You gonna give it to him?
You were listening.
We see and hear everything that goes on inside the so-called game.
Alright, then.  Kable said we got lucky - that they were gunning for us - what was that all about?
Kable got a past... he knows things. Things he don't even know he know.
Huh?   What things?
Things Castle's afraid of. As long as your boy stay on the inside Castle know he can keep him quiet - but if ever got out...  Uh uh. Castle will never let that happen.
One battle left, I think I can handle my bidness.
You're not hearing me - this is not something you can control. They gonna kill his ass, Simon. In the eyes of the world. And then what? You just another poor little rich honky. No Kable, no pussy, no shit.
This is, come on... too heavy... I don't know what the hell you're talking about... I just play games, man. Games.
Mm hm. That's right, it's a game.  You want to win it, don't you?
Yeah, dude, I intend to.
Then you need to cutcho strings, puppet-massa.
Imagine a slayer that don't got to wait to be told what to do. No ping, you dig? A trained killing machine... operating in real time, on pure instinct.
That... would be cheating.
A mod, that's all. Like that guidance system you hacked on three weeks ago lets you track motherfuckers around corners and shit.
 Uhhh...
The game got to mutate, after all. It got to evolve, you feel me?
I do. I do feel you.
Then let's rock, baby.
 Tillman.
You.
We know you talked to him... your Player.
You're not a guard... who are you?
A friend.
I don't have any.
Listen to me: Simon's going to give you what you want. What you asked him for.
How do you know that?
I know something else: whether or not he's controlling you, you will never reach the save point. Castle won't allow it.
We'll see.
No. Listen to me, Tillman - the game is unwinnable - they will not let you live. If you're want to get out and see the people in the picture you'll have to find another way.
I need you to get me something.
What, Kable... what can I get you?
Drunk.
What's he got there?
Kable, what the hell is that?!
Fuck-face - remove the `molotov' from your pants and discard into the recycle bin, now!
PUT IT DOWN!
 I can see turning you loose was a great idea.
 What happened.
YOU happened, jackass. You wanted control, you got it.
No shit...
Yeah, that's right. So please don't fuck up...
What's the matter with you Kable? Kill something!
This is unbelievable.
 Fuck it.
 Kable. Listen: it's the last game. You're going to be dead and I'm going to look like a total asshole if you don't pull your balls together!
Blow me.
Dammit!
Kable. Dude. What are you doing?
What the hell?
GO, GO, GO!
Yeah? Anything else ya fuckin cheerleader?
Fuuuuck!!!!
Kable, PLEASE... get back in the game! YOU'RE SCREWING MY ASS, KABLE!!!
Um.
 Ughh, that was the one.
Shit, shit, SHIT!
I'm dead.
Please stand by... Please stand by... Please stand by...
What just happened?
 That's bullshit.
She's not home.
But Castle's personal security will be, soon enough - trust me, you don't want to meet them.  You know, it's pretty obvious that you'd come here first.
Who are you?
You asked me that once before.
Your voice...
You should really come with me...
... like, NOW.
Hang on.
You a fool.
Stop playing that freaky shit off the rail.
It's a game of deception.
Whatever, that's cuz you got no power...
 Huh? What?
Bullshit.
You guys suck.
 Kable. Holy shit.
His name's Tillman.
Whatever.  You made it. You're really here.
You're the ones who broke me out?
We only freed your mind.
Your ass followed.
Hey, Kable...
You're... great.
 You got questions.
A few.
She took my blood. Why?
The nanex modifies the actual cell structure of your brain...  
Alright.    Why me?
Because Castle's scared of you.
It ain't just a game, you know, Tillman. Everyday there's more people steppin forward, wanna be a part of Castle's world. Throwing away everything it means to be human.
Right now it's the desperate ones... convicts, addicts... the sick, the poor... the ones that fell through the cracks... they have no choice.
But this is only the beginning.
Think about it: the federal prison system is growing out of control, set to bankrupt the whole damn USA... Castle rides in on a white horse, says he got a plan to bail us out and everyone just fall in line.
So what's next? The health care system is collapsing - Castle comes to the rescue again...
This time he's pushin total control of genetic disease... birth defects a thing of the past... all we gotta do is exchange our cells for the ones he wanna give us.
The promise of a longer life and a fatter wallet - you think people will refuse?
Hell no.
They'll be standing in line to hand their babies over to him. Next thing you know, we all slaves.
We can't let that happen.
Gotta bring the man down.
You can help us, Tillman.  You have to help us.
I can't help you.
Tillman.
We know where she is.
Guess you remember that day.
You'd just gotten Kable through his tenth consecutive session alive... no one ever thought an I-con could last that long.
Pretty hot shit, aren't you? King Player.
Good times.
Sure. On the outside.        Now look at these.
This is what it's like on the inside.  Wonder how long you'd last on the other side of the screen.
Simon, you're being held today suspected of aiding in the escape of a convicted murderer from a maximum security penitentiary. The charge is... beyond serious. Your hard drives have been seized - forensics is decrypting the contents as we speak. Your internet activity over the last ten years is being scrutinized and catalogued in minute, vivid detail...
In addition, your father's bank accounts have been frozen pending further investigation - naturally, seeing it was his money that essentially funded Mr. Tillman's escape.  I'm going to need you to tell me everything that happened leading up to yesterday afternoon. Everyone you talked to, everything you heard, everything you did. I need you to do that... right now.
Yeah, um... I need something too.
 Do you now? And what might that be?
Could you dudes do a sandwich like: peanut butter, almond butter, walnut butter... pecan butter, pistachio butter... pretty much any kind of, you know, nut butter. And Welch's grape.
Pistachio. They make that?
It's awesome.
The usual?
Hi Nika.
Oh. Hi. Rick Rape, right?
I thought you weren't allowed to come here anymore.
That was just last month. I was a bad boy.
Are you still a bad boy?
Urkk.
Please don't kill me.
I'll do anything.
Don't say that.
Stop.
This isn't you.
 God damn it... YOU - in there... controlling her... let her talk, motherfucker.
I can't.
She has to say what I tell her.
 You can hear me, baby. I know you can.
I love you... love you...
I love you too.
 SHUT UP!!!
Say anything else and I'll find you... I'll rip you TO FUCKING PIECES, do you understand me?
 I'm getting you out of here.
 I'm going to take you someplace where they can turn it off... the program...
 Hi, Kable.
 Anybody in there?
Come on... do it...
YOU!   WHERE THE HELL DO WE GO?
 You. Run.
 If not...
You're dead.
Now what?
 The crack works - you're the proof... we put the DNA in the soup, light it up, extract it - then feed my girl's sequence into the code and we're good to go.
Basically. We can't quarantine the foreign cells per se but we can disable their ability to transmit and receive.
That would be like cutting out part of your brain.  
How long will she sleep?
We're going to have to keep her sedated until we can kill the link... otherwise she's broadcasting everything she sees or hears.
Thirty minutes... you give us a robot, we give you back a super hot human.
Tillman.
We need to talk, my man.
So talk.
Come on.
Ken Castle made his first billion designing virtual reality simulators for the US military. Six years ago he brought them something new - a breakthrough so profound, he said, that history would be divided up between everything before and everything that came after.
They tested it on soldiers... the first volunteer was Corporal Travis Scotch - a friend of yours, I believe.
Yeah. He was.
The second was you.
The idea was to replace your brain, bit by bit, cell by cell, gradual... the new tissue would never break down, never deteriorate.  A new era in human longevity is what they told us. We were doing the world a favor.
 Nine weeks later Scotch was dead and you were serving life in maximum. Castle's project was shut down... but the shit wasn't a total loss: the same technology resurfaced within a year... in a game. Castle called it society.
Thank you for the history lesson.
Dig me, Tillman. Whatever happened in that project is something Castle wanna be buried. We need that shit, baby: what you saw, what you know.
I don't know what to tell you.
You ain't gotta tell me shit, Tillman.  I want you to show me.
Alright. We're ready to rock.
Let's transmit in three... two... one...
Hooz there?
 What are you doing here? Who are you?
Tech support.
His memories... translated as raw audiovisual data.
Current exponential rate of growth, I can't imagine a piece of tech that will take that long to come around.
They'll have better shit than this in Best Buy within 18 months.
Tillman. Never thought I'd be so glad to see your ugly grille.
Scotch.
 Scotch.  I'll tell you what man: this place sucks.
 They got me hooked up to computers five hours a day... nurses feeding me vitamins, giving me shots, wiping my butt - male nurses, I might add...
What about you? You're dressed like a semi-human being... they let you out already?
I'm not getting out.
 OK.  Tillman... dude. Are you good?
I'm fine.
Uh huh. You don't look good.
I'm sorry.
 Well, it's not like you ever looked that good...
 Tillman, what did they do to you?
 Tillman...
I can't stop it... can't...
Who are you?
I'm sorry...
Not the best commercial for K-soft technology.
 He made him do it.       Castle made him do it.
A test.
It's you.
I missed you... so much...
 Delia.
Baby... what did they do?                                   *
I couldn't stop them.                                       *
Nobody could.                                                *
Your daughter was taken into foster care by the state two years ago.
The foster parent paid good money to remain anonymous... to make sure the girl would be untraceable. But there's always a data trail, if you know where to look.  We do.
Where is she?
I'm sorry, Tillman. Guess he needed an insurance policy.  She's with Castle.
That's all the story you're going to get.
Alright, Silverton. Get up and get out.
Cool.
 Yeah, ain't it? Looks like someone up the chain decided you're no longer a threat.
No link... no link.
Delia...
DELIA!
Not bad for video, eh?
The latest and greatest... defy you to tell it from real life. You imagine porn on this thing?
 You're awesome.
Castle.
Kable.
... you just want your little sugar pie, I know. So don't do anything stupido. My house, my rules.
Come on, I want to show you something.
I've got to thank you for leading me to them, by the by - the human- zuzz that is...
Of course, soon enough they'd be whistling my tune like everybody else... but meantime it was that little cracker program they dreamed up that got my attention...  
I replaced 98% of my own noodle with nano-tissue years ago...
But mine's different.  Built to send - to transmit . Whereas every other K-soft cell out there - including the ones in...  your head, Kable - is designed to receive. I think it, you do it.
We're talking every Slayer, everyone in Society City... I believe your better half would fall under that category... provided they're within range of my transmitters...
 Very nice, Castle. So you've got an army of psychotics and deviants to dance around for you.
You're thinking small, Kable. But not as small as me.
See, nano cells are real small, a thousand times smaller than even these dust particulates...  Inhale it and they go to work: replicating, spreading... like a virus, multiplying in exponentials... six months time I could have 100 million people converted - ditch diggers, porn stars, presidents - and not one would be the wiser.
A hundred million folks that will buy what I want them to buy, vote how I want them to vote, do pretty much damn well anything I figure they ought to do.
For instance.
You should've let him fight for himself, Castle - he might've had a shot.
 I think you're missing the point, my man.
No, I get it - you're pulling the strings on all of this... (starts to move toward CASTLE with BAD INTENT) ... which makes my next move pretty easy to figure.
Neglected to mention: my smart boys reversed that hack those fellas worked for you - easy breezy, once we had access to their drives...
You're mine, boy.
 Come on, lets boogie woogie rock and roll.
Ummm.
Biggest, baddest Slayer in the game... don't seem like much, does he?
Oww!
Lucky shot.  OK, not really.
I need an audience, boys.
That's right, you crawl on your belly like a toad... (he looks to the GEEK SQUAD, sheepish) Is this bad? I'm really bad.
That's sweet.
Alright boys, you ready? A true test.
 No.
Just like last time. Remember?
You're stronger now... a little more fight in you... but I think the end result will be about the same...                                                       *
Shh.
 What the hell was that?
There are 2 networks accessing the same IP address.
Someone on the outside is sending him commands...
 JAM THE SIGNAL YOU GOD DAMN RETARDS!
 Working on it...
 I think it.
You... fucking... do it...
Look at this knife... imagine me sticking it into your gut... think about it... make it real.
 Oops.
 YES!!!
Damn it, kid...
... is the fuckin pose really necessary?
Sorry.
Are you my Daddy Tillman?
Wait.
Shut it off.
Pardon?
The nanex.     Set us free.
It's nothing to you. A mouse- click.
True dat.
Well played, Kable.
Mommy. Why did Daddy Tillman hurt Daddy Ken?
This is for you, you dumb bitch.           I hope you do the right thing with it.
You good, sweetheart?
