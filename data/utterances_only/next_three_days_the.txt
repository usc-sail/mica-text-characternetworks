You know what? If you were smart you would stop talking right now.
Sue me. I just know that women should never work for women.
How can you say that??
They're always threatened. Especially if you're beautiful and they're not.
Erit, you are so full of shit.
So, your boss isn't threatened by you?
Because she's a bitch! --  --Not because she's a woman.
And you would describe her as "attractive"?
That has nothing to do with it!
And there is my answer.
Either of you like another drink?
Women should work under men, men under women. That's it.
 But men under men?
That's fine, too.  They're used to it! Why are you laughing?
 I don't know, bro, but I think I'd rather work under you than her.
 Oh please, I'd rather work under him, too.
You'd rather "work under" John?
You have a problem with that, too?
No, why would I have a problem with your little sexual innuendo?
What is up your ass tonight??
So, I shouldn't take offense that you're coming on to my husband right in front of me.
 Lara, if I wanted your husband I would have him.
How? You couldn't possibly show him more of your tits.
-- You know what your problem is?!
That was a great meal!           Okay--okay!
She is completely full of shit.
DON'T try and agree with me now.
You know what? I don't even believe she is in the dental profession.
Shut up.
I bet she can't even spell anesthesiologist. Woman's a complete fraud.
We went to her office party, idiot.
I think she hit on me that night, too.
You are completely delusional. She wasn't even hitting on you in there; I just don't like her.
I understand. People who look like that should not be allowed anywhere near oral surgery.
You are such an asshole.
You're in the chair trying to stay calm; how are you supposed to do that with those things hanging over your--
Someone's going to --
Hello!
Did he cry?
Only when I dropped him down the stairs.
Thanks.   See you next weekend.
Okay, your turn.
Very good, very good...
No, no, no; you feed me.  Your son is hopeless.
Squeeze in tight.
You can't do this every morning.   It is way too corny.
Smile.   It's just until he's eighteen.
Present.
 Sweetie, you have to stop believing everything you read in a catalogue.
You hate brushing your teeth; this one brushes them in thirty seconds.
 I love brushing my teeth.  The lies your mother tells.
 When's your last class?
Three, and I have papers to grade. Can you pick up Luke?
After yesterday I probably don't have a job anyway. Do you think it was wrong to call her a useless cow?
Bosses admire that kind of frank exchange.
 Did you call your father?
When?
 "When?" Yesterday, for his birthday!
I sent him flowers and a handmade card.
You're completely impossible.
Did you notice what I got for my birthday this year? A grunt.
Mom said Happy Birthday and my father went . Made me tear up.
Ever think that someone has to be the bigger person here?
 Remember this for the custody hearing: how Mommy is always scolding Daddy.
How are you going to feel if Luke grows up and doesn't call you?
Now she's driving a wedge between us.
I give up.
And now she is abandoning you.
Police.   Mr. Brennan?
My name is Detective Quinn. This is a search warrant for these premises.
 Stay where you are.
Get your --
Touch me again and you'll be arrested.
Lara Brennan?
WHAT?!
Lara Brennan, you are under arrest for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas.
She's dead??     Elizabeth is dead??
 She didn't do anything!
I will only --
 She didn't do anything!
Put him in cuffs.
Daddy!...    DADDY!!
It's okay.     Just a bad dream.
You okay?
Okay, you can sleep here as long as you stay on this side of the bed.
You're such a snake, I don't know why I keep falling for the same trick.
But Sam's your friend, right?
Not at lunch.
Does he take your food?
No.
Did he say something mean?  About Mommy?
Yeah.
Did you hit him?
Yeah.
Good.    Where did you hit him?
Near the swings.
Wow.    I bet that hurt.
Yeah.
It's a toy!
Don't worry.     We'll get it back.
Hi honey. Can Mommy get a kiss?  Come on, give Mommy a kiss.
Rat-Bag.   Give Mommy a kiss.
Is Daddy reading you my letters?
Every night at bedtime.
What are you building?    A fort?
Was he scared going to school?
I walked him to class, gave him a kiss; he didn't even look back to wave.
What did you make him for lunch?
Turkey sandwich, just butter and bread, no "vegetables" on it. He swore he ate his apple.
Look at his friends.   And his desk. This is his teacher?
Miss Phillips.
You may have to move to another school district.
Already spoke to a realtor.
 How was your first day?
Excellent. Over half my class stayed awake. Talked to your mom.
When is she coming?
She's having a lot of trouble with her business.
It's only been a couple of years, I'm sure she'll get around to it.  Have you heard anything?
About the appeal? Yes, and I'm just not telling you. What did Meyer say?
--Don't--
-- It can take months for the court to rule.
I saw that woman. She was there. She couldn't have just disappeared.
Meyer's looking for a new investigator.
Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a button pop - they must have been blind not to find it.
He'll go through all the evidence again.
Great, because I haven't quite bankrupted us yet.
We're doing fine.
 You just lie and lie.  But you are very handsome.  Can you do me a favor?
I don't know, I'm a little busy.
I need you to run for governor.
-- Oh, that I can do.
You can change this rule about no conjugal visits, because I don't think I can last another twenty years.
I'm okay.   I'm okay.
I know. But it's going to be fine. I promise.
You think he'll ever want to kiss me again?
Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.
Good?
How's Lara?
She's doing okay.
Tell her we're pulling for her.
I will.
They won't recycle these unless you take off the cap.  This is trash. This is recyclable.
Ok.   Thanks.
Luke!   Let's go, Toad.   Come on.
Time to go, Carrie!
John, I said my office at four o'clock. I can't leave, I'm in --
 I figured you had to eat.
Do you have the ruling in Brennan?
But what if we find the woman who was leaving the parking lot?
The PCRA was rejected. No new evidence can be submitted. Not anymore.
It was a robbery!   Someone stole her purse!
And if they'd used her credit cards we would have had something to argue. I'm sorry; this really...sucks.
So, that's it. Now we just have the Supreme Court.
John, in the last thirty years, the Supreme Court hasn't heard one murder case. No decent lawyer would even file the pleadings.
So, I need to find an indecent one?
No, I'm going to file it. But I need you to do something for me.
Anything.
I need you to look at the evidence and just forget Lara is your wife.
 I've seen the evidence, Meyer.
I'm not saying judge her innocent or guilty, I'm just saying look at it. He co-worker sees her leaving the scene, she has the victim's blood on her clothes, her fingerprints on the murder weapon--
 We went out for dinner! How do you do that after you kill somebody? She would have to be a psychopath!
-- And the fight in the office.
Everyone fights with their boss!
But this one ended up dead.
So, you never believed she was innocent?
How can you say that?
So, what are you saying, Meyer?!
That it no longer matters what we believe; Lara's not getting out. And you have no idea how much I hate saying that.
 I'll find someone to file the pleadings.
John! Come on! For Christ's sake. JOHN!!
I know you won't want to hear this...
-- Erit, go put somebody to sleep.
Thanks.
Had to be done.  I am really going to pay for that.
Lara Brennan; my wife. She was sent up here. Brennan. B-R-
 She can't have visitors.
That's ridiculous; I have to see her.
I'm sorry.
You can't go down there!
You can't be in here!!
Lara!
Lara!
What's going on?!
My wife attempted suicide.
She's not allowed visitors.
I have to see her!
Why isn't she in the ER?
Please.   Two minutes.
Two minutes.
I'm sorry. He just keeps pretending he's asleep.
 Don't worry about it.
It's okay.
I insist.    I kept you out on a school night.
I'm not in school anymore.
And give a big hug to Pengui, Little Pengui, Big Turtley, Little Turtley, Kiki and Opossumy. Lots and lots of love, Mommy.  You gonna give them hugs from her?  Should we write her back?
...When is she coming home?
Soon honey.    Soon.
 Can I have a quarter?
Can you have a quarter?
Ohhh. Sure, but you can't spend those. They come from the cottage where Mommy and I used to take you when you were a baby.
Then can I have them all?
...Sure.
So, what is it about?   Julie?
That belief in someone's virtue is more important than virtue itself?
No. I mean, yes, that's in there. But what is it about?
It is about how rational thought destroys the soul. It is about the triumph of irrationality, and the power that is in it.
It's a course that investigates what drives men to be free, no matter the cost.
Somebody else had dibs on Papillon?
You escaped from jail seven times.
No smoking!!
Yeah, who would want to cut short your precious life?
Mind if I tape you?
Go for it, it can't be used as evidence. What do you want to know?
How you escaped when no one else could.
Balls and a little luck.  No prison in the world is airtight. Each one has a key. You have to find it.
How do you do that?
A lot of looking. Especially at things that break the daily routine. Guards get comfortable doing the same thing every day. Something happens where they have to think, adapt. 
That's when they will make mistakes. But when you see it you have to be ready. You have to have the entire plan already in place before you even know how you are going to get out of the jail. Escaping is easy; the hardest part is staying free.
You have to know where you are going to go and how you are going to get there. You have to know how they plan to catch you, where, and when.
How the hell do you know that?
You pay off someone who knows. And a lot depends on if the prison is in the country or the city.
The city.
Where are you from?
...Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh is tough; so many bridges and tunnels they can block off.
From the time they make the call, the police can have the center of the city sealed tight in fifteen minutes.
How can they be so exact?
After 9-11 Homeland Security made every city have a lock-down plan -- downtown Pittsburgh, Philly, Boston, Minneapolis -- fifteen minutes. They can do DC in under ten.
Within thirty-five minutes they will have cops at every tollbooth on the interstate --
And be running rolling stops on the secondary roads. They won't have your photograph yet, but they will have your description.
What if you can't make it out?
Thirty-five minutes isn't a lot of time.
Then surrender. 
Because they will shoot you on sight, along with anyone you are with.
Stay far away from the train and bus stations.
Forget the local airports.   Leave from another state.
Second: identity. It's easy to find fake papers, harder to find ones that will get you through an airport.
You'll need a passport, driver's license and a social security number.
If you have to rent a car, find a place that will take a cash deposit. They'll still run a credit check, so use a real person's name on the ID.  Third: destination.
You want somewhere that doesn't attract American tourists and doesn't get American newspapers. Think Yemen and you get the idea.
Then money.
You need a truck load of it. Everything's expensive: hotels, travel, information.
How much?
Enough to last at least five-six years. Run out of money and you run out of friends.
But before you do anything, you have to ask yourself if you can do it. Can you forget about ever seeing your parents again. Can you kill a guard, leave your kid at a gas station, push a nice old lady to the ground because she is between you and the door? Because to do this thing, that's who you have to become. And if you can't, don't start, because you'll just get someone killed.
How did you get caught?
I gave myself up. I couldn't take wondering when someone was going to come through the bedroom door.  Got what you need?
Yeah.
What do you have in your pocket?
It was already tied.
You untied it again!
Mr. Brennan?
We met briefly. Byrdie Lifson.
Oh, sorry.    Hello, Doctor.
 I'll bring them back myself.
We check your wife's blood regularly. She's been refusing her insulin. I don't want to sound dramatic, but it's just another form of suicide.
I'll talk to her.
If she doesn't --
I'll talk to her.  Let's go, Squirrel.
Hey. Are you alright?
I'm fine.    I'm fine.
Hi, sweet potato. How are you doing?
The doctor told me about the insulin.
 Yeah, I forgot. It's no big deal.
You forgot?    For how many days?
I forgot, okay? I have things on my mind.
--And so much to do.
Oh, that's nice.
Why are you doing this?
Can I please just watch him play? Tell me about kindergarten.
No.   I need you to --
Fine, I won't forget again, okay? (trying to fight away these thoughts:) I am just never going to walk him to school or wash his clothes or make him dinner...and I don't know how I can live knowing that. Okay?
Lara. Look at me. Something will happen. I promise.
 What? What is going to happen? There are no more appeals, there are no more anything. Exactly what miracle are we hoping for, John?
I need you to do something for me.
Sure.
Stop bringing him.
Come on...
He hates coming here.   Look at him.
Lara....
Please. It's not his fault. It's too hard to watch him forget me.
You want to hear something funny?
Yes.    Anything.
My mother tried to send me anti-aging cream.
You're sure that you don't want a lawn sign?
I'm very sure. Thanks.
On the left, Allegheny County Jail. Built in 1995, it is now the largest jail in the world. There have been three escape attempts. No one's made it out alive. On your right...
On the first landing, which was as small as the necessary turn of the stairs allowed, there was a niche in the column, about a yard wide, and in this niche the prince felt convinced that a man stood concealed. He thought he could distinguish a figure standing there.
Thanks.
Adderall?
Ten apiece, five for forty.
I need some passports.
Piss off.
You have to pay up front.
I can do that.
You know the Uptown on 5th Ave?
No.
Ask for Harv.
What's your name?
Just say Mouss.
Mouss said to come see you.
He did, did he? What do you want?
Three passports, a driver's license, and real social security number.
How do you know Mouss?
He babysits my kid.
 Okay.
You have the photos on you?
Yes.   How much?
Fifteen hundred.
I ever see you again, you lose an eye.
You did remember I was showing the house?
Give me two minutes.
It really is a great neighborhood.
Oh, my lord!     What happened?
It was stupid, I fell off the bike.
The bike that's been in our garage for two years? Put your head back.
Some guy made a crack about Lara.
So, that's what you do now: punch everyone who thinks she's guilty?
What's that supposed to mean?
It means it's important what YOU believe, not --
Really?   So, what do you believe, Mom?
Why are you trying to start a fight?
 Come on, buddy!  Where is his bag?
Why are you doing this?!
No reason. I just stupidly thought people who loved her would actually believe she's innocent. My mistake.
Stop this!
 Give Grandma a kiss.
Does your face hurt?
A little.
Did you hit him back?
No.
That's okay.
What?
I was at the bar.    I know what you are looking for.
I'm deaf, you idiot. I read lips.
You really want to talk out here?
What do you need?
Three passports, a driver's license and social security number that can take a credit check.
Thirty seven hundred.
That's too much.
It is if you never get them. I need photos and a thousand in advance.
I'll bring them Wednesday.
Not here.   Don't come here again.
Parking lot of Don's. Eckert Street. Under the bridge; two o'clock. If I'm not there on time, leave.
Show me how to load it.
No video game.
Dad!
I'll play checkers with you after dinner.
You'll just lose again.
 John? It's Eugenie. You're not going to believe it; the people I brought over? They made an offer! I'll bring it in the morning.
 Not tonight. Tonight, I utterly destroy you.
Mr. Brennan?
And just put your thumb there.
Thanks, that's all I need.
I'll just be a moment.
 Your poor face. How could you do that to yourself?
I am useless without you.    I can't even ride a bike.
I think it's very sexy.
I'm sorry we had to do this.
You have nothing to apologize for. But you should have told me before this.
I know.
I don't want you not telling me things.
From now on I will.
 I won't know where to picture you.  I close my eyes and I see Luke in his bedroom, you on the sofa by the Window. I won't know where to picture you anymore.
John?
Hi.
I was wondering if I could ask you to water my plants next week; I'm going in for an operation.
I hope it's nothing serious.
My idiot doctor misdiagnosed me. He's blaming the lab; the lab's blaming him. But I'll be fine. Thanks.
English Department, this is Catherine.
Hi. It's John. Luke isn't feeling well, I'm going to take him home. I need Carl to cover my 2:30 class.
I will let him know.
Are you ever going to answer your goddamn phone?
You were supposed to leave.
I need them.
You notice that guy was a cop?
Which guy?
The one with the red light in his back window.
Just give me the money.
You want this too much. You're going to fuck it up.
How are you doing today?
Don't touch that.
Sorry.
So, you are where in here?
...In the middle there.
In the middle. Can you point to yourself?
 It's hard to tell.   I think that's me there. Why?
So that's not you there.   By the elevator?
 ....No.  I was over here. You want to tell me what's going on?
You want me to tell you?
Yes.
You know what a bump key is?
Sorry.
If this was you, you might want to think about what's going to happen to your kids if both of their parents are in prison.
-- The worst date you've ever been on? This was worse. And this guy? He really thinks he is doing great. Then he's driving me home and I know he's going to try and kiss me, so I pretend to fall asleep. I mean, I'm actually snoring, right in his car. Does that stop him?
...What?
Did I tell you not to date cops?
Let me in, asshole!!
Open up!  Your car is in the garage, I know you're in there!
What's your problem? He's not home!
Not home?   So you're saying I'm blind?
No, I'm saying you're an idiot.
You know what? You're right.    I am an idiot.
...Dad?
Can I have my cookies?
You hungry?    You want your sandwich?
No.
Carrie!  I'm sorry. She just already has it all figured out.  Nicole.
I remember.
 Really?
 I remember your daughter.
She's hard to forget.  Oh, this is for you. Luke was supposed to bring it home.
He has his father's memory.
It's for Carrie's birthday party. Please come; I'd love to meet your wife.
I'm afraid she can't be there. ...It's complicated.
I understand. With me, too. Carrie, come on, time for lunch.  We're going to the cafe on the corner, would you like to join us?
Oh, we're pretty...you know....
Busy?
Come on, we owe you for the cookies.
That's true.     And I made those cookies.
And learned how to pre-package them.
Which requires a considerable amount of machinery. Come on, Luke.
Do you trade off time with Luke?
No. Luke and I are together full time.
Wow. I guess that's why I see you so much.
She'd like nothing better than to be here. With him. Lara. She really misses...all this.
I guess it's all about priorities, isn't it?
No.  She's not like that.   She'd...  She's in prison.
Oh.
I don't tell most people.
I understand.
She's innocent. She didn't kill the woman.
...Good.   I mean, I'm sure she didn't.
We should really be getting home.
 Oh, okay.
 Thanks for the invitation.    We'll try and make it.
That would be great.
You want to read a letter from Mom?
Dearest Luke Who I Love, But Not As Much As Chocolate...
She didn't write that.
My mistake. Dearest Luke, who I love so, so much. I wish I could have walked you home today, it was so beautiful out.
But what's wrong with her?
She's not feeling well.
Why didn't she just stay home?
Because sometimes people get so sick you have to go to the hospital to get fixed.
How do you know when you're that sick?
The doctors do tests.
Come on.
You okay?
Luke!   Time for bed.
...What's wrong?
What is it?
No....NO! They can't move you. Not without notice! Monday isn't notice!
I was only here through the appeal. We knew I'd be moved to a prison.
Muncy is the other side of the state.
I don't have two weeks!     I need it tomorrow!
The title hasn't been cleared -- there is no way that --
How much can they give me?!
Nothing!
What are you doing?!   You almost killed us!
Are you --?
Are you out of your mind?!   You don't look?!
I am so sorry --
Get away!     Get away from us!
I'm sorry.
No, it was a long shot.       Thanks.
 How's Lara?
She's okay.     Thanks, Meyer.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Is it Luke?
No. He's fine. I had Meyer see what he could do about not getting you moved. 
I told him traveling that distance would be a hardship on us, that Luke was already having trouble at school. Which is true. I haven't been spending enough time with him.
You haven't? YOU haven't? God, John, you are too much. Luke is having a 'hard time' because mommy is in jail for murder, not because daddy doesn't spend enough time with him! Your father was right, you don't live in the same world we do.
 That's nice, that the two of you talk. What world do I live in, Lara?
I don't know, but it's not the real one. I am in here for the rest of my life! And you want me to believe in some fantasy that -- !
We good here?
Yes.   Sorry.
Now you come here all long-faced, like you've let me down. What do you want me to do, make you feel better?
Got it.   I'm sorry.
And now you're apologizing.   You really are a gem.
What do you want from me?
Nothing. You're too perfect already. You know you never even asked me if I did it. If I killed her.
 Because I knew you didn't.
Then you'd be wrong.
I grabbed the fire extinguisher. I hit her in the face. I heard her neck snap. You know why I did it? Because she pissed me off. I threw her purse in the river. We paid for dinner with the cash from her wallet.
I'm sorry.   I'm actually very sorry.
Sir, you cannot stand there.  SIR, you need to exit the building NOW.
Shut up. I don't care what you say or how you say it. I don't believe you did it and I never will. I know who you are.
Thank you.
You think?
 Girls love them.
Hi Mom.
What are you doing here?
I've got class.
Five o'clock at night?
Yes.  Bye.
 Back up! Get back!
-- Shoot them both!
-- I'll shoot the dog!
-- Shoot the dog!
-- You shoot the dog, I'll kill you!
-- You want the police here, asshole?!
-- Good idea!
 -- Put the gun down!
-- Call the dog off!!   Put it away!
-- Release!
-- Put it away!!  PUT IT AWAY!!
In!   Get in!
 You, too!
I'm not getting in there!
Get in!
-- Give me that chair!
Move!
You're dead.
I didn't do anything!!
You brought him!
I didn't bring him!
Shut up!
On your knees! Hands behind your head!
I can't kneel!
On the floor!
Where's the rest?
That's twelve hundred dollars!  Here, take it.
 Where do you keep your money?!
Yeah, I'm going to give you my money.
I'll shoot you!
You won't even shoot a dog.
Tell me!
Shoot the floor again, impress me.
I'm going to kill you both.
No, I'm going to kill you both.
Give him your money!
 Keep your dead bitch mouth shut.
Stop it!!
 See? You aren't going to kill me. That was the worst you can do. So, now you've done it. Go home. I'll come find you and kill you.
You're wasting some good shit.
Yeah, good shit; high alcohol content.
What's going on?! Let me out!
You going to burn me out?
Yeah.    That's what I'm going to do.
Oh Jesus.    Oh Jesus.
Your money.
 This is a meth lab, you idiot!
No.    It was.
 My kid is upstairs!!
-- What??
MY KID!!
Let me go!!
Get up there!!
The house is going to explode!
Is anyone up here?!
Don't leave me. I don't want to burn. Don't let me burn.
I don't want to die.   I don't want to die.
 Get out of my way.
What do we have?
A miracle. Meth lab in the basement, the house still standing. Should be just a crater.
 Do we know him?
Alex Gaidar, history of violence and drug trafficking.
He have a kid?
Neighbor said wife left with him last year. Big surprise there.
They type all this blood yet?
No, but someone left through the back door bleeding. Zone Three found a gunshot victim dead on a transit bench.
Hi.    What are you doing up?
I've come to get Luke.
John?    Are you alright?
I'm fine.
Hey.   Hey, buddy.
What do you say?
Thank you.
Give Grandma a big kiss.
I'm too tired to kiss.
Luke...
I'll get lots of kisses next weekend.  We want to take him to the Harvest Festival in Kutztown, where they have the Clydesdales.
Thank you, Grandma.
Bye Mom.
Goodbye.
 Let's go.
Neighbors saw a guy and a dog chase a black car down the alley, so that's probably his. We'll have the taillight debris at the lab by the time it opens.
Before.
 Can I carry it?
No.    Just what fits in your bag.
....What about my pockets?
Or your pockets.
Daddy will just be a minute.
Taillight matches any 2004-2009 Prius.
 What kind of a criminal drives a Prius?
A socially responsible one? (avoids Nabulsi's searing look by reading the report) Over a thousand of them registered in the city, seven thousand in the state.
How many registered to felons?
Six in the state. Four of them to embezzlers or white collar criminals, one to a rapist, one to a murderer.
Guess we start with the murderer.
She's in prison for life.      The rapist is out.
Find him.
Hello?
...Hi.
Thanks.   Good to see you.
 It's a pony.
Those aren't easy to wrap.  You know the party is at eleven, right?
What time is it?  Nine. Oh, I'm so sorry, I should have looked more carefully.
It's no problem.  Why don't you go give this to Carrie?
Well, I guess you can help.
Oh. Actually, I can't stay.   I have to run some errands.
 We'll see you later then.
Thanks so much.  If....
He...He has my parents' phone number in his pocket. In case I'm late.
No problem.
 Rapist is in a wheelchair.   Not sure if that was karma or --
The murderer. Where is she incarcerated?
 County; right here in town.
 She have a husband or kid old enough to drive?
What?
 Lara Brennan's bloodwork.
 Get the lab.
You pissed off somebody, that's for sure.
Still busy.    I'll try again.
 No. Get an ambulance, take her to University. I'll meet them there.
 Husband. School teacher.
 You got a home address?
No car in the garage. You want to get a warrant?
Yeah.
Get the warrant.
She's being transferred to University Hospital.
Right now?
Right now.
...Have them call the escort vehicle. Tell them we'll meet them at the hospital in less than ten.
Put her in 7725 and start an IV.
 Can you please page Dr. Becsey?
Put the phone down.
Oh please, no.
John??
Remove your holsters, put them on the floor and get on your knees.
 What are you doing here?
DO IT!!
DO IT NOW!!
Lieutenant, the prisoner is secure; jail personnel are 10-27, Code 4. A squad car will meet you at the entrance.
She just said --
Run the light.
Tape their hands and feet.  Do it!!
You have to stop this.
Tape their mouths!
No.   Stop.
Put it on.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!
Because we have no other choice!! Put it on!  Turn around.
Lara, put the clothes on!
No.
NOW!!
No!
Okay. Tell your son you aren't coming.
...Where is he?
Waiting for you. Tell him you aren't coming.
How can you do this to me?
Push send. Tell him I'm not coming back either.
John --
Does it look like I'm going home?! Tell him he is alone now and his mother and father aren't coming back!
You son of a bitch.
What are you doing?
Get out!    Get out!
Where's Luke?! Is he safe?   Where is he?!
He's safe!
What's wrong?
Back away!
Don't be stupid. Drop the weapon.
Get back!
We have units at every exit.     You'll be shot trying to leave.
 Hit the button.
Hit it!
Don't do this.
Where are the stairs?!
 Oh please oh please oh please...
It'll be okay.  Look at me! Do what I say; it'll be okay; I promise.
Lara?
Take the coat off.
Stay here!
Watch that door!
 Who's in the lobby?!
 Get units to Grant Street!
Put your hair down.
They're on the platform! Block stations in either direction! Call the Port Authority. Stop all trains!
 Ring the city. Train and bus stations. Get their descriptions to the State Police.  How old is their kid?
Six.
Let's find out where he is.
Why didn't you tell me?
You would've stopped me.
There's a case in there. Brush, moisturizer, makeup. Everything you had was old. I hope I got it right.
You want to take a guess who just escaped from jail?
Hello.
Hi.   I'm here for my son.
Oh, they aren't back yet.
Back from where?
The zoo.
...The zoo?
It's a zoo party.  They ate first. 
They should be back in about an hour. Would you like to wait?
No.    Thank you.
What's wrong?
Where's Luke?
He's at the party.
What party?     You said the party was here.
I was wrong.     She took them to the zoo.
 She?
Estimated drive time: seventeen minutes.
Carrie's mom. Nicole.
Canvas the neighbors. We're looking for the boy and anything they've noticed in the last few days.
Time to destination: eleven minutes.
You took the wrong turn!    It's back there.
The zoo is back there. You're going the wrong way!  It's back there!  WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!
She'll call my parents.
What??
They'll take care of him, I will figure out how to get him to us.
Are you out of your mind!
I tried!! There's no more time!! Any second now there's going to be a roadblock ahead! It might be there now!! If we don't get out now we don't get out!!
I promise. I promise I will find a way to get Luke to us. I will find some way.
No, it really is fine. I can't thank you enough for taking care of him.
It is our pleasure.    Wasn't it, Carrie?
Hi.
Hi.
Did you have a nice time at the party?
Yeah.
What was your favorite thing?
Ice cream cake.
They had ice cream cake here?
At Carrie's house.
Oh.   What flavor?
Lots of flavors.
My favorite.
I'm going to sit back here, okay?
Sure.
I think we're going to the cottage.
Really?
I have money.
Good.   Then I'll stick close to you.
Okay.
-- Traffic down to two lanes at the tollbooths. And downtown is worse. Stay away from the train station if you are trying to get anywhere. Not sure what is happening but a KPGH caller says trains aren't moving and commuters are getting irate. 
John?  What are we going to do?
 We're going to the train station.
 Hi.
 Hi.
 You're not going to nod off, are you?
Stay in the car.
I understand....I understand. I didn't tell them to stop EVERY vehicle. Just the ones with a couple and a young child.
Are you sure twenty dollars is enough? Ticket to Buffalo costs three times that.
 This thing is very good on gas.
Every one in the state.
Go wider. Send their photos to every train, bus station and airport in a three hundred mile radius.
 So, Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Michigan, Kentucky and Indiana?
You know what direction they are going, smart ass?
Captain, a lot of these places barely have fax machines.
Then start dialing.  Prioritize. Closest airports first.
You want to see it?
Only if it will tell me where they are.
Not so lucky.
How far is it to the Canadian border?
Four, five hours?
 Collero!!
Excuse me?   You call this coffee?
I'm calling from the Pittsburgh Police Department. We have a fugitive warrant for Lara and John Brennan, they are most likely traveling with their six year-old son, and we have reason to believe they might be flying out of your airport.
How many airports in Ontario and Quebec?
Should I stop calling and count?
Yes, we are sending you photographs. We would appreciate it if you could disseminate them....How many terminals?
 I got his parents!
 You know how many times you've lost our bags?
So, you just decided to go for a drive, for the entire day?
George wanted to see the leaves.
So you have absolutely no idea where they are going?
I told you.    We never spoke.
I'll do this.
Hello.
Thank you.
Too bad you didn't find more of it.
Yeah. And wish I could figure out where this is.
I checked websites for every tourist destination I could --
That's the presidential palace.  It was all over CNN. When they deposed...what's-his-name.
We know where they're going!
They're on it. Do you have the photographs?
....No.   Thank you.
It's starting to rain.
I'll call the FBI.
You ask yourself why we found this bag and not the others?
This guy was a teacher?
At a community college.
Was it raining when we searched the crime scene?
Three years ago?? What are we doing here?
Act like a cop. Grab the other side.
You're out of your mind.
You really thought you were going to find it?
Good luck.
