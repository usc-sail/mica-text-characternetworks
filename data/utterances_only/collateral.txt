Stuart Beattie
You okay?    Sorry...
 Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, mate.   Enjoy                      * LA...
...it's always you. Why is everything always directed at you...?
...everything is not "always about me." He was being sarcastic and you goddamn well know it...
...I'm sorry, I didn't hear it that way...
...oh, bullshit! How about the dig about the makeover...?
...what do you want me to do, punch the guy out? I work with him. And you're perfectly capable of taking care of your own......
 ...well, last I checked, you were sleeping with me, so unless you wanna start fucking him, I suggest...
Hey, leave-up on him, man...
Say what? What you lookin' at, bitch? 
* How'd you get the chop suey all over                     * the cab?                                                 *
* I didn't. The cab got in a fight with                    * a gang of Chinese Cholos.                                *
* There's been sprouts by the passenger                    * door.                                                    *
EMPTY_LINE
I need it transcribed...                                *
Off the line sheets.                                    *
'Cause I think it's him on there. In                    * the gold Lexus on the cell. If it is,                   * he's enhanceable, 'cause of priors in                   * the late '80's...                                       *
...no, the transcriptions need to be                    * done by seven a.m.. Period. Okay?                       *
How ya' doin'?   Where to?
Downtown. 312 North Spring Street. Take Sepulveda to Slauson to La Brea. La Brea north to 6th into downtown.
 So you'll be up late. I'm pulling an                    * all-nighter, too. Save the tears.
I'll take 105 east and up the 110. It's faster.
 What?
 105 to the 110 is faster.
110 turns into a parking lot around USC.
This late, the 110 is moving, but La                      * Brea north of the Santa Monica is                         * jammed.                                                   *
110 north of the 10 you get people                        * going to Pasadena and they drive slow.                    *
That's why I jump off at Grand.                           *  But, hey, surface streets is cool. That's what you want, that's what we do...                                                     *
Are we taking bets?   What if you're wrong?
Your ride is free.
You got yourself a deal.
Go ahead, say it.    Go ahead.
...lucky with the lights.
You weren't "lucky with the lights." What you were was right. I was                           * wrong...  ...Max.
You mind turning this up?
You like Bach?
 I used to play this piece in high school.
Let me guess.    Woodwinds?
 Viola. I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were unloading into that cell phone.
 Different instrument...  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be all bogged down in traffic right now, and you would have made an extra five bucks.
Yeah? Keep it. Buy yourself something. Go wild.
 A gentleman. I thought chivalry was a necessary casualty of gender politics...
Not a big thing, you know...?
How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
There were two of us. I killed the other guy. I don't like competition...
You take pride in...being the best at                   * what you do...?
This?  This is temporary. You know. Pays the bills. I fill in with this. I WILL be the best at what I do, but                      * that's something else.
What else?
I'm setting up something...                             *
Like tell me...?
...limo company I'm putting together. Island Limousines. An island on wheels. So I'm part-timing until I get delivery, Benzes off leases, work up my client lists, staff up, all                       * that...
You like being a lawyer?
You psychic?
I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught your phone call. And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe.                     * Elegant, not too hip, which rules out                   * advertising, plus a top drawer briefcase, that you live out of, purse                  * looks like a Bodega...
 Bottega.
...Bottega. Guy gets in my cab with a machete? I figure he's a sushi chef. You? Clarence Darrow.
Not quite. He worked defense.     I'm a prosecutor...
Big case?
Yeah.
You got us here fast...
You never answered my question.   You like what you do?
 Yeah.
But not right now...?
 No, I do...like I can't wait. ...I                     * love standing up in that courtroom.                    *  At the same time...I always get this clenched-up thing the night before the                 * first day...
Clenched-up how...?                                    *
 I think I'm gonna lose. I think I                      * suck. I think my case sucks. I                         * haven't prepared enough. My exhibits                   * aren't in order. People are gonna                      * figure out that I don't know what I'm                  * doin'. And I've had this charade                       * going for years. I represent the                       * Department of Justice of the United                    * States government and my opening                       * statement is gonna fall flat at the                    * really important point and the jury's                  * gonna laugh at me.                                     *  Then I cry... I don't throw-up. A                      * lot of people throw-up. I have a                       * strong stomach.                                        * * Then I get it together. And rewrite                    * my opening statement. Work the                         * exhibits. For the rest of the night.                   * That's my routine.  In the morning, it starts. I'm fine.                   *
You need a vacation.                                   *
 I just had...a vacation.   On the Harbor Freeway.
No. Not in a cab. You need your head straight, gotta get your unified self up, get harmonic...you know...
When was the last time you took a break?
I take little ones all the time.
How often?
Dozen times a day.
Maldives Islands. It gets heavy, I take five. Go there.
No, I couldn't take that...I couldn't.
Yes, you could. You need it more than I do.  It helps. I promise.
Wow.   Thanks for everything, Max...
Sure thing.
In case you ever...I don't know...wanna start an investigation of a Fortune 500 company or argue cab routes or something...
ASSISTANT UNITED STATES ATTORNEY CRIMINAL DIVISION CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
Hello?
 Uh, yeah...
Let's go to... (Max isn't paying attention) You free? Or...                                            *
Yeah, yeah, sorry...
Where to?
452 South Union Street.
 How long you think this'll take?
Fourteen minutes.
Fourteen?    Not fifteen?   Not thirteen?
Two minutes to get onto the 101. Transition to the 110 to the 10 and exit on Normandie is four minutes. North on Normandie is five minutes. Two minutes to South Union 'cause there's roadwork. Thirteen plus one for "shit happens."
Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?     A free ride?
An apology.
...I already offered up the free ride                     * today.                                                    *
To who?                                                   *
...some girl.                                             *
Did you ask her out?
First time in LA?
No. To tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave. Too sprawled-out. Disconnected. You know...? But that's me.  You like it here?
It's home.
17 million people. This was a country, it would be the fifth biggest economy in the world. But nobody knows each other. Too impersonal.                      * But that's just me...you know...                       *  I read about this guy. Gets on the                     * MTA, here, and dies. Six hours he's riding the subway before anybody notices. This corpse doing laps around LA, people on and off, sitting next to him, nobody notices.
I see your point.   Yeah...
Cleanest cab I've ever been in.   Your regular ride?
Yeah.   I share it with the dayshift guy.
Prefer nights?
People are more relaxed, you know? Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
You get benefits?
Like sick leave?                                          *
Retirement? Health and welfare?                           *
It's not that kind of job.
Start a union.
Me, specifically?
Why not?
Last thing I need is a reason to keep driving a cab. It's temporary. I'm fillin' in, you know, while this other thing I'm putting together is shaping up...
How long you been driving?
Twelve years.
Really? What else are you putting together?
I don't talk about it.     No offense, but...
 None taken. Talkers and doers.      Like you, I like doers.
Fourteen minutes.    Man, you're good...
Lucky with the lights.
Yeah, sure. You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen...I'm in town on a real estate deal. A closing. One night. I got five stops to make, collect signatures. See some friends. Then I got a six a.m. out of LAX. Why don't you hang with me for the night...?
I'm not a hire car.    It's against regs...
Regulations? These guys don't pay you sick leave.  How much you pull down a shift?
Two-fifty, four hundred.                                 *
I'll make it six hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you get me to LAX and I don't have to run for the plane.
...take a chance.
Man, I don't know.
Yes, you do.
 Yeah. Okay.
Cool. We got a deal. Here's three hundred down. What's your name?
Max.
Max?     I'm Vincent.
I can't double park here...
I'll meet you in the alley behind the building.
Definitely not from around here.
He - He fell on my cab...! 
 You always stutter?
Well, yeah. Yeah. Guy fell on my motherfucking cab from up there...!
I think he's dead.
...taken two .45s and did a high dive onto his head. It's a good guess.
You - you killed him?
No. I - I shot him.     The bullets and the fall killed him.
Red-light-green-light? Light's red.
You can run, but you'll die tired.
Put down your hands.  Are you cool? Say "I am cool."                            *
You are cool.
No.  You say you are cool.
I am...I'm cool.
Okay.   Help me out here.                                 *
With what?
El Gordo decided to get some air and not take the stairs. So we go to plan B. Pop the trunk.                                         *
My trunk?
I can't                          * leave him here. So unless you want him riding up front with you...and given the hygiene...  ...and his sphincters let go...
Gonna roll him off the hood.                              * * Always lift with your legs...                             *
I don't think I can do this.
He's only a dead guy.    On three.    Uno.                 * Dos. Three.
Got it?
Yeah.
What?
His hand moved!    His goddamn hand twitched!
It's a spasm! Jesus, don't be such a girl...
* Never heard of a treadmill?                                *
Six liters of blood in the average Angeleno, he's gotta dump all his...on your cab.  Okay, that's good enough.
Uh, look...why don't you, like, take the cab...
"Take the cab..."
Yeah. I - I'll chill. You know. And...they don't check. You know? They don't. They don't know who's driving these things. You, me...
And you promise you will never tell anybody? Right? ...get in the fucking car.
Can we leave the scene of the crime,                      * now, please?
I'm trying...
Max.
It's not me!
The engine is already on. Put the little pointer on the letter "D." "D" stands for Drive.
You're making me nervous.
I'm making you nervous?   I'm the one on a schedule...
Ramone?  Estas fiestando con una chica?
Fuck.
Try deep breathing.
What?
Adrenaline's wearing off. You get shaky after. Some people slip into shock. It's not uncommon. Deep breathing helps.
Is that better?
I think so.
What are you doing?
It's a mess.
So?
Lady Macbeth. Leave the seats. The light's green. We're sitting here.
Asshole!
You no longer have the cleanest cab in La-La Land. You gotta live with that.                     * Focus on the job. Drive.
 7565 Fountain. You know it?
West Hollywood.
 How long, you figure?
Seventeen minutes.     Why?
Oh.   Oh, no. You're kidding.     We...
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
You said you were visiting friends!
They're somebody's friends... * You drive a cab. I make my rounds. We both do our jobs, you might make it through the night and come out seven hundred bucks ahead.
I...I'm not trying to piss you off, see? Okay? But I can't drive you around so you can murder people... Man, that's not my job...
Tonight it is.
You don't get it. I mean it.     Really. I'm not up for this...
You are stressed. I understand that.                     * Keep breathing. Stay calm.
Are you breathing?
Yes.
Good. What else calms you down? Candy? Cigarettes? Breathe.
Music.
Play music.
Chopin prelude. Stodgy.  Here's the deal. 
You were gonna drive me around and never be the wiser. But because of El Gordo's high dive, we're into Plan B. Still breathing?  Now. We have to make the best of it. Improvise. Adapt to the environment. Darwin. "Shit happens." The I                            * Ching...whatever. Roll with it...
I Ching?   You threw a man out a window!
I didn't throw him, he fell.
What'd he do to you?
Nothing.   I only met him one time.
Then how can you kill him like that?
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet and you get bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Who, who was he?
What do you care?    Ever hear of Rwanda?
Rwanda.    Yeah.                                         *
Tens of thousands killed before sundown. Nobody's killed people that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Did you bat an eye, Max? Did you join Amnesty International, Oxfam or something? No.  
I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
I don't know Rwandans.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel any better, he was a criminal involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Oh, that makes it okay, then. 'Cause                     * all you're doing is taking out the                       * garbage...
Something like that...  What you need to remember is that nobody gets out of this alive. Even if we quit smoking. Cut out red meat. Everybody dies...
Please pull the vehicle over to the curb.
 Get rid of 'em.
How?
You're a cabby. Talk yourself out of a ticket.
Please.   Don't do anything.
Then don't let me get cornered.     You don't have the trunk space.
I can't believe this...
Believe it.
Don't. I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them...!
 Probably married.
Maybe that one's got kids.     Probably                 * his wife's pregnant...
I'll deal with it!
License and registration.
Pulled you over 'cause your                              * windshield's smashed.                                    * * All of this current?                                     *
Yes, officer.
Wha'd you, have a food fight in here?
Is that blood?                                           *
Yeah. See...  I hit a deer.
A deer...
Over by Slauson.
A "South Central" deer?
Goddamn deer jumped out in front of me. You believe that?
 Why you still carrying a passenger?
I was headed back to my depot, see, you know? And his drop's on the way.
Yeah, but your cab's not safe to drive. And we're going to impound it. We need to do a vehicle inventory while we wait for the tow truck. Pop the trunk and step out of the vehicle. (swings flashlight beam to Vincent) 
I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to phone for another cab.
Is that necessary, Officer?   I'm just a half mile from here.
I'm afraid it is.   Please exit the vehicle.  You, too.
You open that trunk, they go inside.
Hey, man, it's been a long day. You know? It's so slow, I pay this guy to ride so I don't get lonely...  My first fare. How about a break? I'm heading to the barn, anyway...
Get out of the car.   And open the trunk...
Officer needs help. We got a man with a gun. Shots fired at 83rd and Hoover...
Let's go.
 Get that cab back to your garage...
Breathe.
 I thought Californians exercised...?
 What are you lookin' at?
Hands on the wheel. Ten and two. Like they taught you in driver's ed.
Why?
Because I say so.                                       *
Cab's a disgrace. No wonder the cops                    * pulled you over.
Max? Max? You out there, you son of a bitch?
Who...is that?
Lenny, my dispatcher.
I know you're out there!    Answer the goddamn call!
What happens if you don't?
He'll keep calling.
Max?   Answer! Vincent reaches across Max, pulls the mike off the dash, holds it up to Max's mouth.
Don't blow it.
Uh, yeah?    Lenny?   It's me.
I got off the phone with the cops.   A desk sergeant called to check you brought the cab in...
Yeah?   So?
So? So, aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the goddamn cab?
It got crashed!    I didn't...
Do I care what, where or why?    You're                  * payin'!
It was an accident. You're not liable.                                       *
It was an accident.    I'm not liable.
Bullshit! I'm making you liable!                         * It's comin' outta your goddamn pocket...
Tell him to stick the cab up his fat ass.
I can't do that.     He's the Man.
So what?
I need the job.
No you don't.
You still there? I'm talking to you! Max? Max?
He's not paying you a damn thing!                       *
Who the hell are you?
Richard Riccardo, Assistant U.S.                         * Attorney. A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
 Let's not get excited.
Not excited? How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you try to extort a working man? You know                           * goddamn well your collision policy and                   * general liability umbrella would cover the damages. What are you trying to pull, you sarcastic prick?
I'm just tryin' to...to...
Tell it to him.  Tell him he's an asshole.
 You're an asshole.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna stick this yellow cab up his fat ass.
Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna stick this yellow cab up your fat ass.
 Don't wait up, hon.   I gotta work late.
HEY!   HEY! OVER HERE!    I'M IN THE CAB!   HEY! HELP!
HELP! GODDAMN IT! THERE'S A MAN WITH A GUN! HE'S GONNA KILL PEOPLE!
Oh, fuck me.
GODDAMN IT, I'M FLASHING LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE OVER HERE.
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.                                  *
Oh. Oh, thank God! Hey, hey, man, help me out here!
 I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel, here, by this guy, who's taped me in the car, 'cause he's up in the building somewhere...
...yeah, he's coming back. Hurry. Get me loose so I can call the cops...
Are you kidding me?
 My hands are taped to the damn steering wheel!
...don't shoot me, don't shoot me...
Yo' homie...
 That my briefcase...?
 Where's the button?    Under the dash?
 Yeah.
You mind turning it off?
Another collateral.
What's that?
Collateral damage. People in the wrong place at the wrong time.  And you? You attract attention? You are gonna get people killed who didn't need to be. Understand?
I'm low on gas...
Pull in there.
Vincent?
Yes, Max?
Am I collateral?
I haven't decided.
But, hey!    New news. We are ahead of schedule.
Huh...?                                                   *
We got time to kill.  You like jazz?
I'm...what? Sorry?
Jazz.
Not that much.
Guy told me about a place off Crenshaw. Leimert Park. All the West Coast greats played there. Dexter Gordon, Thelonious Monk, Chet Baker. Like that...  Buy you a drink. Expand your                             * horizons...
...this informant of yours, what's his name, Ramone?
Ramone Gallardo. Supposed to take him for a drink. I come here, find this.
You been working him?                                    *
Four months...a low-level player, he's                   * been feeding me stuff on Felix.
Reyes-Torrena? Forget Felix. Feds                       * are all over that. They don't want us anywhere near it.
Since when is the LAPD working for the                  * Feeb?                                                   *  Besides, Ramone flew out a window. My                   * C.I. flew out a window, he's got Felix's handprints on his ass. Yes? That makes it ours.
 Where's the homicide, Ray? Where's a                    * body? All we got is glass...
And blood...                                            *
Huh?                                                    *
...small splatter patterns here...all                   * over there...                                           *
Ramone flew out the window. Went                        * splat. Here's the glass.                                *  Then some tires rolled over it.                         *
How's that spell homicide?   Maybe he jumped.
Sure. He's depressed. So he jumps four stories out a window onto his head.  
"Wow, that feels better!" Picks himself up. "Now, I think I'll go on with the rest of my day..."
 Ray! Catch!
* So, who's got what? Any witnesses? We been knocking on doors?
Old guy across the street, lives above the deli? Says he saw a cab parked here earlier tonight. There were two guys working under the hood.
Description. What did he see?
"Kinda" saw...guy's got glasses like coke bottles.
Did he "see" it or did his seeing eye dog see it?
Late-model four-door Ford.   Yellow or                  * orange.                                                 *  Maybe it was a taxi cab.
Four thousand taxis in LA County.  What else...?
Remember fall, 2001? That Bay Area                     * deal? Oakland. Cabbie drove around                     * all night. Killed three people...
Then he flipped out, put the gun to his head. So what?                                     *
So the Oakland PD detective,                           * whatshisname, never bought it.
Why?
The Cabbie had no criminal record. No history of mental illness. Pops three people, then himself? And the victims weren't random. Two were involved in some pharmaceuticals scam...  Anyway, the detective always thought there was somebody else in that cab.
...a little '60's, early Miles thing                   * happening...                                           *
I never learned to listen to jazz.
You don't learn to listen...anymore                    * than you learn to breathe. Open your                   * ears.                                                  *
I get a beat.   I don't really hear a                  * melody...                                              *
...he's off the melody, behind the                     * notes. Outside what's expected.                        * Improvising off impulse. Kind of like                  * tonight.                                               *
Like tonight?                                          *
Sure.                                                  * * This is nothing, if not "What's next?                  * Right now. In the moment."                             * * There's people...ten years from now?                   * Same job, same place, same shit.                       * Everything the same; keepin' it safe.                  * Over and over and over and over...                     * * "Ten years from now?" Man, you don't                   * know where you'll be...ten minutes                     * from now...tonight.                                    * * That's what he's saying. Open your                     * ears. You'll hear it...in his                          * "dialoguing" with the trumpet...                       *
'Nother Vodka tonic, hon?
And one for my friend.  Who's on the tenor sax?                                    *
That's Daniel, baby, he's the owner.
He is terrific. Would you be so kind                       * as to invite him over after his set?                       * I gotta buy him a drink.                                   *
Sure thing, darlin'...
...I was a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables. Right here. Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point. Being around the music, that was the thing. And I was. Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in. Mr. Louis Armstrong.
You're kidding me.
Right through those doors.     The man himself.
Jesus...
He was in town playing two gigs a night at the Coconut Grove in the Ambassador Hotel... After his last set, he decides to come on down to South Central to hang with his people. That's how he was, you see. Never forgot who we was. Money and fame an' all that? Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn. 
So before you know it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
Was it great? Better than great, it had to be...
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence. Louis was playing. God was smiling.
You heard Armstrong play live. I've never been this jealous. You get to talk to him?
Did better'n that.
No.
Oh, my, yes.
C'mon...
Fella owned this place back then, cat                      * named Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis                      * that I played. So Pops, he just waves me right up. My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?
How'd you do?
How do you think? You ain't shit when you playing next to Louis Armstrong. But, Dippermouth, he was kind. He could see me trying. He carried my ass as best he could.
Remember what you played?
Most vividly.  "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
Whipped dog?                                              *
Whipped dog on a wet night.                               *
Crowd dig it?                                             *
 The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but that was the moment of my conception. Right here in the used-to-be crowded room.                           *
Crowds not here now?
Oh, jazz ain't the draw it used to be.
But the place looks great.
Only 'cause I got the wherewithal to                      * finance keepin' it up on my own.                          *
What a great story. I'll tell the                         * folks in Culiacan and Bogota that story.
You know the people in Culiacan and Bogota?
 'Fraid so.
And here I thought you were such a cool guy.
I am a cool guy. With a job I was hired to do. You know how it is.
Let him go, Vincent.
I'm working here.
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow. You like the man, you like the way he plays. How about a little jazz, huh?
Improvisation? That's funny from you.                    * (thinks about it, looks to Daniel) Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this? I'll ask a question?
What question?
Jazz question. You get it right, we roll. You disappear. Tonight. You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
I never lie. Ask Max.     Max, have I lied?
No.   No.   He hasn't lied...                            *
Means you're a man who lives on                          * reputation.  I will take your word. And I will give you mine. If I walk out of here tonight, I'd go so far away, it'd be just like I was dead.
And one more thing. Those guys and                       * their man, here, what's his name,                        * Felix?                                                   *
Yeah.                                                    *
Tell them, if by some chance I get                       * this wrong...you tell them I had to.                     * They laid a grant of immunity on me.                     * So it was flip and play ball or go                       * back inside. I ain't goin' back                          * inside.
Sure.                                                    *
Lay it on.
It's simple. What was Louis' first musical instrument?
I know all there is to know about Louis.
Then let's have it.
 It was a trumpet!   Wasn't it?   Wasn't it a trumpet?
Coronet. Bought it from a New Orleans pawnshop when he was a kid. 
Cost him five dollars. Got a two-                          * dollar advance on his salary from a fine Jewish family he worked for, saved up the rest.
Tin horn. Cost him a dime. Rode the junk                   * wagon and played for the neighborhood. People sold them stuff. Rags. Bottles. Whatever.
Let's go.
No.
What you mean, no?
I'm done.    Find another cab.
Max?
Leave me alone.  I'm collateral anyway, so do it and                      * stop making me a part of this!                           * * I don't wanna know you!
 I'm not playing.
You played him, man.                                     *  He got the answer right, would you                       * have let him go?
Max?   Maaax. Pick up, you dipshit.
What is it with this guy?
Maaaaaax!
You hassling my man again?
Who are you?
Same fare you talked to last time.
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?                       *
Nothing! Aside from every night Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow! May he come on the line, please.
Hang on.  Carefully...
Yeah?
Your mother's calling every ten minutes. Why didn't he show? Are you                      * all right? Where are you?
 Show for what?
 Tell her I can't make it tonight, okay?
What am I, related to you?     You tell her yourself!
Show up for what?
She's in the hospital.
You visit every night?
Yeah.   What difference does it make?
Cause if you don't show it breaks a routine.
So?
So people start looking for you, this cab. That is not good.                                  *
No. I can't take you to see my mother...
Since when was any of this negotiable?
Stay three paces in front of me and one to my left...
Flowers?
Waste of money.   Won't mean a thing to her.
 She carried you in her womb for nine months.
Hold, please...
Five.    Thanks.
Having a good night?
Mezzo-mezzo. You?
Hi, Ma.
I've been calling and calling.
I got caught up at work.
Why couldn't you call me on the telephone? I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened to you...
* I brought you flowers.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
You're gonna cheer up.
How? By worrying...                                    * * ...that you spend money on                             * things...that all they're gonna do is                  * wilt and die?
 See? * I didn't buy 'em. He did.                              *
Who? Come in. What I got is not                        * contagious.                                            * * Why didn't you tell me we had company?                 *  And what's your name? Sorry. My son is rude.
No harm done, madam.
You paid for my flowers? They're beautiful. Max, will you introduce us?
Mom, Vincent.   Vincent, my mother, Ida.
I'm really happy to meet you, Mrs.                       * Rilke.
Oh, call me Ida.    To what do we owe this pleasure?
Well, I was with Max when he got the call.
And you came all the way here to see me?
It's nothing.
Tell my son. You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to do anything.
Tell me about it.
You must be an important client of Max's.
Client? I like to think of myself as his friend. A mentor.                                    *
Max never had many friends. Always talking to himself in the mirror... It's unhealthy.
Hey, mom. How many times do I have to ask you not to do that?
Do what?
Talk about me like...I'm...not...in the room, here.
 What's he sayin'?
Ida, he says he's standing right here.                   * In the room. Here.                                       *
 Yesss, you are, honey.  He's sensitive.
I know.    But I'm sure you're proud of                  * him.
 Of course I'm proud. You know, he started with nothing. Look at him today. Here. Vegas. Reno...
Mom, Vincent's not interested.  Let's go.
No.   I am interested. IDA What's your name, again?                                 *
Vincent...
I came to see you. I saw you.     You look fine. Let's go.
Limousine companies.
Yeah?                                                     *
He drives famous people around, you                       * know?                                                     *
Limousine companies?    What an achievement...
Visit again?                                              *
I'm only in town tonight.                                 *
When you come back?                                       *
Sure.   I promise.                                        *
Well, nice to meet you, Vincent.                          *
Stop or I'll go back and kill her.
You'd do her a favor.
I'll tell her the truth!
Don't!
Red-light-green-light, Max.
Bullshit.
 What the fuck was that?
Jazz.
You are screwing...with my work! My                       * prep was in there. I'm coming up on number four. The night is no longer young. Are we getting adversarial?                        *
Didn't know you could do that...  Let's see what else you can do.
 We've had three come in tonight. Two John Does. Maybe one's your guy.
No.   Not Ramone.
Try that one.
No.   Next...
That's what's funny. These three came in within half an hour of each other. And the kid and that last guy (number 4)...they were done by the same shooter.
Why do you say that?
Same wound pattern. Two in the sternum. One in the head. Add this cat's shooting tight groups.  Double taps are a couple millimeters apart.
...yeah, I'm still at MLK. The John Doe doesn't pan out. Not Ramone. But you'll never guess who else is in the meat locker.
Elvis Presley?
Sylvester Clarke. Criminal-lawyer turned lawyer-criminal?
"Sly" to his clients...
...including my high-diving informant, Ramone, who he represented, who's still missing. Both of whom were in the exotic-substances business...
Ramone and "Sly" Clarke in one night?
In one night. Something bad is going down. And I don't think the Feeb know about it...
Limos, huh?
Don't start.
Hey, I'm not the one lying to my mother.
She hears what she wants to hear.    I don't disillusion her.
Yeah, right. Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Whatever   I tell her's never good                       * enough.    It's always been that way... My three   older brothers...their wives made 'em   move outta town.
You're goin' to a place called El Rodeo. It's on Whittier Boulevard in Anaheim.
Where on Whittier?
Look it up.
What's at El Rodeo?
Just drive.  They project onto you their flaws, what they don't like about themselves, their lives, whatever. And then they rank on you, instead...
How do you know?
I had a father like that.
Mothers are worse.
Mine died when I was one.                                *
What happened?
He hated whatever I did.    Got drunk. Beat me up all the time.
Then what?
 I killed him. I was 12. 
He was the first.  I'm kidding. He died of liver cancer.
I'm sorry.
No you're not.  So driving this cab "temporarily" is                    * all bullshit...?
It's not bullshit.
Twelve years is not temporary.
You gotta get cash together. Insurance, bond, maintenance, tires. Staff-up. Client lists. It's not get the car, put asses on seats.
Why not?
'Cause Island Limos will be more than a ride...like a club experience, a cool groove you don't want to end. Like that. So it's gotta be perfect.                    * Perfect.
Uh-huh.
Plus I got bills. She's been dying of the disease since I was in high school...
Here's good.
Gimme your wallet.
Why?
I'll hold it for you in case they search you.
In case who searches?
The people inside. Go in and ask for Felix. He's expecting you.
Felix?   Okay.    What's he look like?
Dunno.   Never met him.
Who is he?
He's from who hired me.
I don't get it.
You destroyed my work-ups. And number four is due. Whatta you think, night's over? Called on account of rain?  Go be me. In there. Score the                            * backups. He'll have 'em on a flash drive or CD...
 Why don't you go?                   * Why me? I can't. VINCENT They don't know what I look like. And                    * I don't meet people. Like in risk                        * management. Protect anonymity. And you're not going to screw that up.
How'm I gonna be you?
Max, who's SoCal Cab Company?    Ralph SoCal?
No.
Ever met the owner?                                      *
No.
Well, I don't work for them. I work for their bosses. They don't get to meet me, either.
If...if I don't pull it off...?
They're gonna kill you.                                  *  You got ten minutes. 10:01? I drive the cab to the hospital and execute your mother on my way out of town...and don't pretend indifference.
I can't do this.
You threw my PC onto the freeway. You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
If I pull it off, it's gonna get other people killed...
Out of options, Max. Take comfort in                     * knowing you never had a choice.
Uh, how long you been doin' this?                        *
Why?
In case he asks.
Private sector? Six years.
You get benefits?
No. Nor paid sick leave. Quit stalling. Get out of the cab.
Who is this?
Not Julio Iglesias...
Mark the time.
Yeah.
Uh, hi...
Que pasa?    Wha's up, homes?
I'm here to see Felix.      He has something for me.
 Don't know no Felix.
Uh. Say...say it's Vincent.          I'm Vincent.
Lt. Richard Weidner.      LAPD.   Major Narcotics Division.
Detective Ray Fanning.      LAPD.    Major Nar...
 Yeah, hi, okay. Agent Frank Pedrosa.
Thanks for seeing us...
Yeah. You're welcome. How can I help? What's up? Why do you wanna know about our case?
Has there been any unusual activity tonight?
As in...
As in a murder or maybe a murder spree in Wilshire Central.
All quiet on the western front. Various people are asleep. Various people are not. They come and go in cars, pickups and taxis. Other than that, we're watching air move.  ...your interest in our case?
Hood's all beat to shit.
On what?!                                                 *
On that.                                                  *
What's the license number?
I thought you'd be taller.
Anyway I look at this, I see only one thing. I see one thing with you. Here. Tonight. I see trouble.
So.   Vincent. Explain...
Don't know no Felix.
I'm Vincent...
Did he say "Vincent?"
* Vincent don't meet people. The jefes                     * in Culiacan, Bogota, maybe. But he                       * won't talk to you. But, now you are                      * here. Okay. Why?
I lost my stuff.
"Stuff"?   Your "stuff"?
Yeah.
I want you to listen to me real well.  Special teams put together that list                     * of..."dedos."                                            *
Dedos?
Fingers. Informants.                                     * * Signal intercepts, voice-recognizing                     * software, surveillance...very                            * expensive counterintel produced that                     * list.                                                    *  An important list, wouldn't you say? And you "lost" it?
I'm sorry.
Sorry? Sorry does not put back together again Humpty Dumpty...
Do you believe in Humpty Dumpty?
No.
Do you believe in Santa Claus?
No.
Neither do I.  But my children do. They are still small. But do you know who they like even better than Santa Claus? His helper, Pedro Negro. Black Peter. There's an old Mexican tale that tells of how Santa Claus got so very busy looking out for the good children that he had to hire some help to look out for the bad children. So he hired Pedro. And Santa Claus gave him a list with all the names of all the bad children, and Pedro would come every night to check them out. And the people, the little kids that were misbehaving, that were not saying                        * their prayers, Pedro would leave a little wooden donkey on their windows. And he would come back and if the children were still misbehaving, he would take them away and nobody would ever see them again. Now, if I am Santa Claus and you are Pedro, how do you think jolly old Santa Claus would feel if one day Pedro came into his office and said, 'I lost the list.'? How FUCKING FURIOUS do you think Santa Claus would get?!
So tell me, Vincent. Tell me what you think.
I think...
What?
I think...  ...I think you should tell the man behind me to put that gun away.
What did you say?
 I said. Tell him to put the gun away. Before I take it and beat his bitch                       * ass to death with it.
I picked up a tail.
Federal?
You tell me. How do I know? So I tossed the list and work-ups to protect...in part...  ...your Hermes, Facconable sorry ass.
You think I like comin' here? Like I got stupid all of an instant? Shit happens. You gotta roll with it. Darwin. I Ching...
Has, uh...
The fat man. The penthouse guy.      The jazz man. It leaves two.
 Can you finish?
In six years, have I ever not?
...are you telling me Ramone Gallardo and Sylvester Clarke were murdered tonight? Both killed...?
...Sylvester for sure, Ramone...
 We got another D.O.A. One "Daniel Baker" in South Central...
That's three? He killed three in one night?
Three what?
Three witnesses.  For a secret grand jury, secret my ass...
So who's left? Before you lose them, too...
The last two...
Do not fail.
I never do.
And as a token of appreciation...I want to offer you a discount. Yeah. All my services, here, tonight... Twenty-five percent off.
Twenty-five?
Hell, make it fifty.
Very generous.
 By the way. Daniel said he was sorry.
 Go to Fever. He's met me. If it begins to go wrong, close his eyes. He cannot fall into their hands...
...yeah, uh-huh...African-American, medium build, dark hair...are you sure?
* LA101 to chase units... I want a three-car revolving tail on that cab.                  * LA102 is on him, now, at El Rodeo. We                  * will do a take-down of the cab with Vincent in it before he gets where                     * he's going. * Locate our witness, Peter Yip...wife,                  * girlfriends, mommy, daddy, whatever.                   * Get him evacuated. Get him safe.                       * * On the cab, the assault team, when                     * they are in place, will do the take-                   * down. Do NOT spook him before. I want Air Support up and to maintain at 1,500 feet.
 E-mail me his license. Okay?   I'll wait...  Anybody else in that cab?
Vegas odds would have compelled a "don't pass" bet on you walking out of there...
...I'm very impressed.
Washington Boulevard. After-hours dance club near Crenshaw called "Fever." Know it?
Twelve minutes.
You'll be late. Jump on the freeway                       * and get me to the 105 west.                               *
Why?
Do it.
...according to the cab company's dispatcher, this cabbie's been driving that cab for twelve years...
So what?
...so, you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and, shazaam, changes into a meat-eater, super- assassin? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
No. Cabdriver Max is floating down a storm drain. He is stuffed in the trunk of a cab. He is being devoured by flesh-eating stretococcus...
The guy, who walked out, looks like this guy...!
'Cause he picked a cabdriver who looks like him...
What's Vincent look like?
Who knows. He's a ghost...   Vincent's not even his name.
I don't know...
We do. 
We see private-sector security working for cartel groups in Colombia, Russia, Mexico...hiring ex-Special Forces types, ex-KGB all the time...
Guys with trigger time, skill                           * sets...real tradecraft...                               *  ...like, look like a "cabdriver."
What are you gonna do?
Take down his ass.   Save our witness.
What if they're wrong?
The guy identified himself as "Vincent" and just met with the bad people!
Bullshit.    There is something else going on.
It's not our game!
 Let's go.
Air 4 to LA103. I lost him. You're in controlled air space. I gotta stay out until I get clearance from LAX tower...
 ...you lost him?  He can head anywhere out of LAX. North or south on the 405, east on the 105, the 110...
They locate Peter Yip?
 On with the wife. She thinks he's at Fever. They called. Can't get through.
 Washington and Crenshaw. Move!  LA101 to LA103, LA104, LA105. Fever. After-hours club on 2407 Washington, near Crenshaw. Pico Union. Hit it!
 LA105 to LA101. Copy that.
Would you have called her?
Who?
Your lady friend. The one who gave you her business card.  Or was she just being polite?
I don't know.
Why hold back? Why not act off your impulse? Pick up the phone?
All I owe a fare is a ride, Vincent.
It's not what you owe me. Time is fleeting. Life is short. Time is luck. One day it's gone...  You make it out of this alive, you should call her. That's what I think...anyway...
There...!
We get Yip out. You take Vincent.                           * Clean shots! Watch your backgrounds.
Booth towards the back. That's where he hangs. Fat Korean guy. Terminal acne as a youth. You go first. 
Fifteen feet in front and three to my left. Wander, and innocent bystanders get the first rounds. Clear?
* There's Yip! Get him out of here!                       *
VINCENT!!!
 Middle of the dance floor!    There he is!
FBI! FREEZE, VINCENT! DON'T MOVE!                         * FREEZE! HANDS IN THE AIR!
Don't shoot! I'm not Vincent!
 FREEZE! HANDS IN THE AIR! ON YOUR KNEES! NOW! NOW!
 You're... 
I'm Max!   I'm a goddamn cab driver!
I know.    I know!
I'm Detective Fanning, LAPD!   I'm                       * getting you out of here.
Oh, man, am I happy to see you!     I don't believe it!
Yeah. I know. Relax.     Breathe. You're okay.
I can't believe it.   I can't believe it...!
 GET IN!
DRIVE!
What a clusterfuck. Only thing didn't show up was the Polish cavalry.
You don't wanna talk, tell me to fuck off...
 ...fuck off.
...blood, bodily fluid and death get to you? Try deep breathing. Or remember, we all die anyway...
You had to kill Fanning?!
 Who's Fanning?                                          *
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that? You couldn't wound him? The guy had a family, maybe parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was a good guy, and he believed me...
I shoulda saved him 'cause he believed you...?
No, not just that.
Yeah, that...
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
It's what I do for a living...
Some living.
Head downtown...
What's downtown?
How are you at math? I was hired for five hits. I did four.
 One more.
There you go...!
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
'Cause you're good.  We're in this together. You know...fates intertwined. Cosmic coincidence. All that crap...
You're full of shit.
I'm full of shit?  You're a monument of it. You even                         * bullshitted yourself, all I am is taking out the garbage. Bad guys killing bad guys...
'Cause that's what you said...
And you believe me...?
What'd they do?
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witness for                       * the prosecution" look to me. It's probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted... I dunno.
That's the reason?
That's the "why." There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason. To live or to die.
Then what are you?
 ...indifferent.
Get with it. Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us. Lost in space. The universe don't care (about you).  The cop, you, me? Who notices?
What's with you...?                                      *
As in...?
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said: "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person across the street, there, what they think, who they are, how they feel, or I will kill you"...they'd have to kill you...wouldn't they...?  'Cause you don't have a clue...about...anyone.                                   *  ...I don't think you, you have a clue,                   * period. Did anyone "do" for you in your life...? Ever? When you draw breath in the morning? Open your eyes in the a.m.? You anticipate...anything? Want anything? Expect anything? I don't think so...  'Cause you are low, my brother, way low... and some standard parts that are supposed to be there?...with you, aren't. So what happened to you, man? What happened to you?
...all the cabbies in LA, I get Max, Sigmund Freud meets Dr. Ruth...
Answer the question.
Look in the mirror.  
...with your paper towels...a bottle                    * of 409...a limo company someday. How much you got saved?
None of your business.
Your business "plan?" Someday? "Someday my dream'll come..."?  And one night you'll wake up and discover it all flipped on you. Suddenly you're old. And it didn't happen. And it never will. 'Cause you were never going to do it, anyway. The dream on the horizon became yesterday and got lost. Then you'll bullshit yourself, it could never have been, anyway. And you'll recede it into memory...and zone out in a Barcalounger with daytime TV on for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about killing.                         * You're do-in' yourself. In this yellow-and-orange prison. Bit by bit. Every day.
All it ever took was a down payment on a Lincoln Town Car. What the hell are you still doing in a cab?
'Cause I never straightened-up and looked at it, you know...?
Slow down.
 ...myself, I should have. My brothers did...  Tried to gamble my way out from under. Another born-to-lose deal! Then, "it's gotta be perfect to go!" You know? Risk all torqued-down.
But you know what? It doesn't matter. What's it matter, anyway? 'Cause we are...insignificant out here in this                         * big-ass nowhere. Twilight Zone shit.                         * Says the badass sociopath in my backseat. So that's one thing I got to thank you for, bro... Until now, I never saw it that way...
That was a red light!
...not until now. So what's it all matter? It don't. Fuck it. Fix it. Nothing to lose. Right?
Slow the hell down!
Why? What are you gonna do? Pull the trigger? Kill us? Go ahead, man! Shoot...my ass.
Slow down!
Vincent?
Go fuck yourself.
Well.   That was brilliant.
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
 12A75 requesting an RA unit at Grand and 9th for a TC with injuries...
Are you alright? What happened?
 You've been in an accident. An ambulance is on the way to help you. Do you understand what I am saying to you? Sit down on the curb. Okay?  Anybody else in there?
Don't worry about the cab. They'll get you a new one. You okay?                            *
 I'm...fine. Fine. Just dizzy and                        * shit.                                                   *
Sit there and breathe deep, sir.                        * You'll be okay.                                         *
Put your hands where I can see 'em! Get on your knees! Slowly!
Huh?
Sure. Arrest me. Take me in.    Police station. LA County's good.
Get your hand off your gun!
Look, someone's gonna get killed if I                    * don't, it's...                                           *
* PUT YOUR GUN DOWN!
NO!   I gotta go, see, you don't...                      *
* PUT THE GUN DOWN!
HEY, HEY! When did this become a negotiation?
Cuff yourself to the goddamn door.
You're in a world of shit...
Good! Do us a favor. Call the police! I'm going to 6th and Fig.                          * * I got no time to explain...                                *
Hey, asshole!
Fuck off!
 C'mon, go through, go through...
Annie Farrell.
 Annie...it's Max.
 Max...
Max, the cab driver!
 Max?  ...kind of a strange time to be calling...
Listen! Listen, okay? There's a man. His name's Vincent. He's come to kill you!
He's...what? Where are you...?                         *
 Kill you! He is coming to kill you!
 Is this a joke?   'Cause it is not funny.
A guy, Felix, hired him! Or people Felix works for. He's already killed witnesses, now he's coming after you! He was scoping out your building when I dropped you off. I don't know what happened, but he got into my cab.
Did you say Felix? As in Reyes- Torrena? How do you know about my case? I don't understand...
It doesn't matter! Get out of the goddamn building...
...okay, okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
No, no, wait...! 93    OMIT                                                            93
...he's two floors below you.
In my office?!
Where are you, what floor?
Sixteen, law library and files.                            *
He doesn't know you're up there!    Stay right where you are! Call 911!
Max, are you sure?
Call the goddamn police!   Don't move from that spot...
 Hang up. Hang up! Annie, get out! He knows where you are!
Hello?   Max? What did you say?
Shit!
...call will be answered in the order received. If this is not an emergency...
911.   How can I help you...?
There's a man in the building!     He's trying to kill me. I'm...
...hello?
Max?
Let her go.
What are you gonna do, shoot m--
Max...?
Jesus, Max. You shot my ear off.                           *
Okay, MAX!
CALL THE POLICE!
Where's the next station?
YOU CAN'T WIN, MAX!   I DO THIS FOR A LIVING!
We're almost at the next station.
Guy. Gets on a subway. Dies.  Think anybody'll notice?
