 Your last taste of Sicily.
NO!
 We are not beggars.
 NEW YORK! You can see the lights from the deck!
Come on. Come on.
Sit in the back.
 There is some mistake.
 Back. You know "back"?
Front. Back.
Sit in the back.
Nero.
Rosso!
 A lucky boy. You're playing again?
 Only when there's another fool with a dollar to bet against.
 The Teacher hit me first!
 You have a smart teacher.
 He's only a baby!
 Mama, I'm not a baby!
 Don't talk back to your mother.
 Take him. I can do nothing.
 Where were you before?
Scuola Trenta-Quarto.
 School Thirty-Four? Hey, me too.  I live on Thirteenth Street.
 Hey, me too.
 I'm Frankie Costello.
Salvatore Luciano.
 Sal-va-tore. Back home that's a beautiful name. But here Sallie's a girl's name. Some these bums might get the wrong idea. Capice?
 I want an American name.
Charlie.
Cha-lee?
Char-lie.
Char-lie.
Fuck you, Charlie.
Fucka you, Frankie!
Son of a bitch!
Somma bitch!
Suck my dick, motherfucker.
Muddafucka somma bitch. Sucka my fucka you.
Hey, fellas. Ya know them Micks over there don't like no Heebs.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Yeah. Well we don't sell protection ta assholes anyhow.
Kick him in the balls!
Frankie. Didn't I tell ya about makin' nice ta the customers?
You fellas got names?
 Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
They call me Bugsy 'cause I'm fuckin' crazy, man.
No shit.
Tell ya what. In consideration of this little misunderstanding, we're gonna give you fellas protection for free.
Keep your fuckin' Dago protection.
 Prosciutto... from Lercara Friddi.
Stayin' for dinner, Paisan?
 No! Prosciutto must hang to dry before you eat it. He may come on Sunday.
 Dinner will be ready when the dinner is ready.
Careful, Pop. Frankie might get his throat wet.
 I work from seven until seven. Every day. But on Sunday I can only afford one bottle of wine. How can my son, who does not work at all, afford a new suit?
 I know of the things you do.
 When you wanted money to buy a bed, you were under my feet.
 Saturday I will pay double.
 So I should ask Don Maranzano?
No. No. No. Don Maranzano? No.
Please, no... An-to-nio.
ROSALIE. NO!
 And you must still pay double!
Who's Mr. Tutti-Frutti?
That's Don Maranzano. He drops one a them fuckin' gloves at your feet, you're dead.
Ya comin' in?
Moliari knows ya got a beef. We gotta figure somethin'.
Look where ya goin', Turdbrain!
I go where I want.
Bringin' me dinner, Jew Boy?
So, give it to me.
I THOUGHT I TOLD YA TA KEEP YOUR FUCKIN' DAGO PROTECTION!
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
Long as Charlie says.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
You ain't even a man yet.
That ain't what your mama said.
You slimy fuckin' kike!
Until I met her, I thought Catholics didn't eat meat on Friday.
 ENOUGH!
Just like the fuckin' slammer. Lock guys up in a room together an' everybody goes fruity.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
When we get outta here, I'm gonna steal somethin' nice for your mom.
Why wait? Ain't ya still got it hard for that Moliari fella?
Sure. But John Law's got it hard for us.
There's a lotta other folks they ain't looking for.
What the hell you talkin' about?
Guess I owe ya one, Charlie.
Would somebody here please speak fuckin' English?
Why I gotta be hooked up with the only stupid Jew in New York.
Fourth floor.
Let's get to work.
He lends money. Gotta be a bank.
Let's get outta here.
This is a Jew job. Remember?
 Alfredo. It's Don Maranzano.
 Please. I must use the toilet.
 Can I help you, sir?
 Where is Mr. Moliari?
 Moliari? Up the stairs.
Excuse me. I am sorry.
 Dirty thieving Jews!
Four-twenty-eight.
What's that divided four ways?
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
Think about it. Who runs things? The punks who go ta jail? Fuck no. It's the guys with the dough.
And dough is gonna put us into business with John Law.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Shane was a friend of yours?
He was around...
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
But if ya can't catch the guys...
Inactive. Dead cases, so to speak.
Might I?
What caused you to mistake me for a twenty-five cent prostitute?
Was it you cut Shane? Or are you just the bagman.
I need a perpetrator. Who? WHO??
Barone. It was Barone.
Knew it all the time.
Missed ya, Mama.
Salvatore!
 The police came looking for you.
 That's all straight now.
 I found this under your bed. It was stolen from the jewelry store on 12th Street last week.
 Snoopin' ain't nice, Pop.
 Is it so important to have a gold buckle and no honor?
 I wanted it, so I took it.
 You are not my son! You are only a thief and you cannot live in my house any longer!
 So long, Mama.
 No. NO! You cannot put my Sallie out on the street!
You ain't always gonna be poor.
What would it take to get a couple fingers of Scotch?
A miracle. We have nothing.
I finally get the dough for good booze, and them frustrated old broads in the WTCU put the country on the wagon.
I hear they're gettin' twenty a bottle for fuckin' moonshine.
So what's the good news.
Th kid in the Building Inspector's office couldn't wait ta roll over. Tell me the warehouse you wanna knock in, and ya got the blueprints.
And the 15th Precinct?
Captain Murray won't go under one- fifty for the lottery.
It's not enough we pay his rent, we gotta buy him a house too?
Fuck 'em.
Sure. Bring your friend over.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
From your mouth ta God's ear.
He's got a line on the good stuff.
A friend of Nucky Johnson has a boxcar of bottled-in-bond Scotch whisky sittin' on a spur in Philly. Wants 35 G's. I got ten.
Nucky's a straight shooter. We ain't gonna get fucked.
Who's Nucky's friend?
Arnold Rothstein.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
How ya figure?
It figures.
Fuckin' right it figures.
Twenty-five's pretty much our stake. Anybody got a problem?
What's the deadline?
Monday. Cash. In Philly.
Wednesday.
I don't think they wanna wait.
Wednesday. Or not at all.
We could lose the deal!
If we have to.
Let me see what I can do.
Get them bums outta here!
When did Capone get back in town?
So Chicago's been good to ya.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
And a lot more. Can we talk?
Sure. What's with the brick wall?
Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
Around the block.  Ya gotta get way from New York, Charlie. Maranzano. Masseria. Them old Dons are never gonna give ya any daylight. Colosimo was the same way. Couldn't see the future if it bit him in the ass. But in Chicago you can get away with axin' the Capo. Here, you're stuck with 'em.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
But ya got a Boss.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
You're a big target, Al. Finish your cigar.
That's three.
Four!
Five! Six!
Nobody kills a guy who owes me money.
Come on in. I'll let Mr. Rothstein know you're here.
I'm glad you came down. I prefer to do business face to face.
When my money moves, I go with it.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
Revisions? He didn't say nothin'!
There's been another offer at forty thousand.
We have a deal.
You asked for an extension.
And when you gave it too me, I knew you were hurtin'.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
Ya wanna queer the deal? Be my guest. But show some goddamn respect! This ain't some Guinea pimp you're talkin' to here! This is Arnold Rothstein! THE MAN WHO FIXED THE FUCKIN' WORLD SERIES!!!
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
Could we step outside?
I got my partner in there!
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
That's a suit for a man grubbing for money, not one who has it.
I have exclusive deals with four distillers in Scotland, and ships under contract to bring ten thousand cases a month onto the Jersey coast. I need distribution, but I won't do business with Maranzano or Masseria. All their talk of honor only indicates their misplaced interest in power rather than money.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
Don't worry. I got friends to take care of that.
Produce. Produce is a livelihood. In thirty years it's never disappointed me. Good times and bad, people gotta eat.
Produce sent my Anna to private school.
Mahogany. Produce.
Enough produce.
There's always room for a new man.
Rothstein put me on to this place.
Jesus. How's a guy supposed ta fuck in a joint like this?
Meyer just finished the books.
A million bucks. In the last six months.
Guess I just wasn't born to it.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
Charlie Luciano.
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
The goddamned bastards.
Tell me about it.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
Poor, yeah.
But not you.
Am I such bad luck?
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
I must know more of you, my son.
Not a lot ta know.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
Don, I'd be honored.
Who was that?
My fuckin' meat packin' plant.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Shuddup.
Wanna know what I think?
Spare us.
I think these rich shits -- no offense Bobby -- are so dead below the waist that they gotta ride around all day swingin' at each other ta get their broads hot.
You got a point there, Bugsy.
Hey. Whatever the hell works.
You come to parties to be alone?
Why are Americans always so desperate to have a good time?
Inside, they were talking of you.
I can just imagine.
No. They envy you.
For being a bootlegger?
For being a man.
 Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
The name's Charlie.
Words of praise are meant only for the great, and you, my son, will do great things.
My bambino, please.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
And how many soldiers do you have?
I've got friends.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
He's an animal!
 He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
You are of the Sicilian blood. You waste your time with these Jews!
Thanks for lunch.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
What about the share.
You get fifteen percent.
I got partners.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
And the Jews?
 Share with them as you wish. Do business with them on your own. But no filthy Jew will ever be a brother to me.
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
Hey. Calm down. They're crazy. We're not. Let's use that. Okay?
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
So what is the problem?
The minute we sell out to Maranzano, that bastard is gonna have you knocked off.
He's afraid of you, 'cause you're a Sicilian. And maybe, someday, you're gonna want to be the Boss of Bosses. If he iced you now, there'd be a stink. But if you work for him, nobody's got a beef.
The deal's too good, Frankie
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
That I got a smart Jew partner.
I'm gonna thank the Don for the invite, then we're gettin' the hell out of here!
Paisan! Merry Christmas!
Good ta see ya. How's the Mrs.?
Like always, Bugs. Pregnant!
So ya told Maranzano ta fuck off.
I sent him a case of Scotoch.
Sure. A polite "fuck you".
Where's Masseria?
In the corner. He's been askin' after ya.
WHERE'S MY FUCKIN' WINE! Spend five grand for a party an' can't get a fuckin' glass of wine.
Ya already look drunk ta me, Don.
But not drunk enough!
Buona fuckin' sera.
Maranzano's tryin' ta kill me.
He's nottin' but a fuckin' cunt. He's got no balls so he schemes and lies like an old woman.
He wants you on ice, 'cause that way he thinks he can beat me! Fuck that! Come with me and we'll knock the crap out of him together!
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
I like that.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
Ya piss like a man.
Hey, Meyer. This the chickie that got your number?
Anna, I want you to meet an associate of mine. Frank Costello.
You're an importer also?
Well...
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
That's it.
Where's the stiff?
Come on. Be polite.
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Jesus.
Hell. It's been four days!
Come join the Polar Bear Club.
Charlie, Gay Orlova.
We already met.
My Aunt Dill is in from Kansas City. Maybe I'd better check on her.
You here with Bobby?
No. I'm here with you.
It's been a while. I didn't figure to see you again. In fact, I wasn't sure I ever saw you at all.
It's so cold out here.
There are warmer places.
Are you frightened?
Why should I be?
You're so soft for a hard man.
I had everything. Once.
So what happened?
Life knocked me back.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
And now you have everything.
No. Not everything.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
I guess I am. Just a little.
What do you mean?
Scared.
What's the matter?
I must be going.
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
I'm already late.
For what?
Answer your phone.
Don't go.  Hello.
 We got problems, Charlie.
I don't even know where you live!  Meyer, do I have to remind you what day it is?
 Three of our trucks were hijacked last night. We got New Year's comin' and no inventory.
Get hold of Frank and Bugsy. We gotta go to Atlantic City. Now.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
I turned him down flat.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
Masseria's been after me too.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
We were overdue to get hit.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
We can operate around these guys.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
Okay. I'm listening.
A hundred years ago Austria was run by a prince named Metternich. Austria was weak, and it's neighbors were strong. But they were ruled by passionate men, while Metternich was ruthless and brilliant. If one country got too strong, he rallied an alliance against it. He would lead all of Europe to the brink of war, then bring the enemies together and forge the peace.
He barely had an Army, but he had Europe by the balls.
Makes sense, Charlie. We gotta be making the moves from now on.
This is your territory, Nucky. How'd you like ta make a lotta dough for doin' nothin'?
Spill it.
Rothstein gets an exclusive to land booze on the Jersey shore. We get protection for our trucks up to the Camden ferry. You get ten percent from each end.
 There's a shipment landin' at Cape May today. Might solve your problem with New Year's.
Who's is it?
Don Maranzano's.
 It was only an accident!
 Tell them to throw their guns out!
 It's impossible. Do as they say!
 Throw out your guns and coats!
No!
Forget it.
Fuck 'em.
SHIT!
We'll figure out something.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
LEAVE IT ALONE!
The food's already cold. We gotta wait for the rats to come out?
When the old man calms down give him this.
Tell Ma I'm sorry. I didn't have time to get it wrapped.
I got a booger hangin' out my nose, paisan? Cause if I don't, I suggest you step over to the fuckin' mirror and take a look.
Come off it, Bugs.
 Come off it, Bugs.
Ben-jamin.
Is it blood ya want?
Tell me when ya got enough.
There's nothin' in this world crazier than a crazy fuckin' Jew.
Wrap it.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
You wouldn't live out the week.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
They don't give a shit about us!
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
Which is why he doesn't need us.
All they care about is killing the nephew of some guy who screwed their grandmother fifty years ago!
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
I thought we just wanted to be left alone to run our business.
It's past that. We take over the whole show, or we're all dead.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Well, shit. Why the fuck ya didn't come right out and say so!
Luciano.
 I was calling yesterday.
Something came up.
 I needed to see you again.
Same here.
 You're sure?
Yeah.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
It's a mask.
You got something to hide?
It's too late.
Have you thought about this?
Why? You're the innocent one.
Guess I'm too confused to think.
Don't worry, Charlie. I've never hurt a man.
Hope ya come hungry.
Excuse me bein' rude. Lookin' at food always makes me hungry.
I'm glad ya come.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
It's only us and Sonny. Hey, Sonny. Come on out.
You boys carryin' pieces?
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
See if these two are my friends.
So eat.
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
Never threaten me, Boss.
But yeah, I'll join up.
Under the right conditions.
I'm number two. Above everybody but you, including Catania here.
We get a fair piece of all the action, and everything from me and my associates goes into the pot.
Everything, that is, except not one fuckin' drop of whiskey. That stays with me and my friends.
YOU FUCKIN' WEASEL! YOU STUPID SHIT EATIN' WEASEL!!
You skinny son of a bitch! You're the only paisan in this whole fuckin' town ain't afraid a Joe the Boss!
I guess we got a deal.
I'll be spending most of my time helpin' the Boss with the day to day. Frank Costello will be in charge of all the gambling, and my good friend Sonny Catania will oversee burglary and the other strong-arm operations.
We will maintain a special relationship with Tommy Reina and his boys in the Bronx. Treat them as your brothers.
We will maintain a respectful relationship with the Profaci family in Staten Island and with Maranzano's outfit in Brooklyn. They don't fuck with us, we don't fuck with them.
What about Lansky and Siegel?
I got a liquor business with them, and they've also got the toughest enforcement operation in town, so I expect you will treat them very respectfully.
Charlie, Vito has an idea for a job. I wanna hear what you think.
I know this girl works for Seventh Avenue Fashions as a bookkeeper.
And you're pokin' this sister so sweet, she's gonna help you nab the payroll?
They got some old man who picks up at the bank every Friday.
I looked at the job last year. That geezer ain't workin' alone.
I figured we could hit 'em on Thirty- First Street.
Traffic's crazy at that hour. How you gonna get out of there?
This business is about taking risks.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
If there's a war, we're not gonna win it our troops in the slammer.
That's right. You bastards won't do me no good in jail.
Come on, what's the problem?
Meyer.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
No. We ain't even...
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
I been thinkin'...
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
Like a party for all our friends.
Italians, Jews, Irish. One big party. Course, some guys don't get along.
Like Don Maranzano.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
I'll handle the Boss.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
How soon can we pull this off?
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
Might as well put the time to use.
Who is Meyer to have such friends?
Look at his hands. A common butcher, fat from too much meat.
Mama. Meyer's a man of liberal sensibilities.
You could have stopped him.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
So you all make the same mistakes?
Gives us something in common.
I wish I could disagree.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
He's trying to make it.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
What the fuck does that mean?
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
You're so big, you don't even have to come to the meet. You have your number two run it for you.
And that shitloader Maranzano don't even get a fuckin' invite.
Don't I make the Boss look good?
Mr. and Mrs. Michael Land. We're in the Presidential Suite.
Of course, Mr. Land. If you could sign in please. And you, sir?
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Luther.
 You wouldn't be related to the Bryn Mawr Luthers, now would you?
I suppose not. They're quite fair.
I ain't stayin' in a hotel with no fuckin' kike!
Wassa matter? Some Ziegfeld shiksa you're bangin' convert ya?
Didn't Nucky tell you about the deal with the hotel?
Yeah. Yeah. Got me a new name, and I wore my funeral suit so they'll think I'm a fuckin' Senator.
Had it custom made.
So comforting to know there's only one.
Mista Albert Caper.
Excuse me, Mr. Caper.
There seems to be some confusion about your registration. I believe I can find you a place at the Ambassador. Many persons of the Jewish faith find it quite...
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
And I ain't no nigger either!
Sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.
I call 'em niggers and kikes, but I let 'em into my fuckin' hotel.
You own a hotel, sir?
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
A fine establishment, Mr. Caper.
And the name ain't Caper.
Look, buddy. What's the big idea?
Mister Capone! Excuse me.
We get together, we can tell those greedy Scotsmen what we're gonna pay for their whiskey.
Makes sense. But who's the Boss?
There ain't no Boss.
But I don't understand. Is this a Sicilian operation? A Calabrian operation? A Jew operation?
It's an American operation. Everybody gets a vote.
But who's the Boss?
There ain't no Boss.
Come on, Frankie. You can tell me. Who's the Boss?
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
Boo-Boo.
Not another word.
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
You've got the public upset, Al.
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
What are ya tellin' me, Charlie?
We're asking you to go to prison.
But I've never served a day.
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
Awwh, Charlie.
Minimum security. You'll have everything but broads.
Al, you owe me one.
Shit!
Civilian gets blown away, cops come to me for answers.
There's rules. And number one is no contract jobs in my territory.
Basement.
Boss wants you right away.
Where we headed?
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
Boss, I got all the time you need.
I know about you.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
Didn't know you felt that way.
Don't you smart talk me!
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
You gotta plan these things.
And I got it all planned.
Go ahead, Charlie. We can always fight this out in Hell.
You're wasting my time, Charlie.
You'll never be the Boss. You're too in love with livin'.
The motor's runnin'.
Bastard didn't even show.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
I'll do fine.
Maranzano wants you dead.
Yeah. But he needs me alive.
If it's a blessing you need I'd suggest the ablutions of the Holy Mother Church.
Who first? And when?
TACTICS! Always tactics!
Strategy.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
The Big Picture.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
So change it.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
And what do you want out of this?
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
It's been too long, my bambino.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
I found that out.
We learn from life.
That's why I'm here.
Coming with me will be a delicate matter. We will work it out. But Charlie...
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
I'll take care of the Boss.
Not Masseria. The Jews.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
I don't fuck my partners.
No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
Enough!
One word, and all this will end.
No.
Always the wrong word, Charlie.
They will still die, even if you die first. And all for nothing.
Why must you hurt me like this?
NO! Let him live to see what the Jews have cost him.
Pull yourself toward me.
I booked passage to London.
London?
My friends have a country house we can use for a while.
What the hell is wrong with you!
If I look weak now, it's over.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
You're lookin' better already.
Where's the morphine!
You're getting' 10 cc's
I told you twenty!
Relax, Charlie.
You bastards, I said twenty!
It'll just be a few minutes.
I NEED THE TWENTY!
Fuck you all.
Not you!
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
 Guess I'm just lucky.
That's just what they're calling ya pal. Lucky Luciano.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
You got men on Profaci's place?
We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Who?
Tommy Reina.
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Don't touch Tommy until Masseria goes after Profaci.
JESUS CHRIST WILL YA LISTEN TO ME!
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
I'm startin' ta think Profaci's losin' it. Been here three weeks and he ain't given us a look.
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
 How's Bugsy doin'?
Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.
Bye, Frank.
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.
 You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
I meant just what I said.
You're not the only one who has to be hard for the world.
That's why I understand you.
Would it be painful for you?
It always is.
Drop the package!
Frankie? Is that you? What the hell's goin' on?
Deliveryman had the wrong address.
Yeah... ya sure Profaci's okay?... Tommy's havin' dinner with his Aunt in Brooklyn like he does every Monday.
Yeah. I got time.
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
Just wanted ta say hello.
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
That a Jew compliment?
Best we got.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Guess so. Ya got a minute? I got somethin' for ya.
Take any one ya like.
Kinda early for Christmas, Bugs.
A Jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
Ya got a eye for a tool.
Blow a fella's brains clean out.
You're fuckin' crazy.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
This is nice. I mean it.
From here, Paisan.
See ya around.
Oh, Tommy.
It's a bad world.
Ain't nuttin' looks worse than a stiff laid up in the street.
Sonny, you better hope you Boss needs you more than he wants me dead.
 NO! Get away you dirty bastard!
 Giovanni! It's Masseria!
Ya can do business with a guy a long time and still have no idea what gets his dick hard. Then, somethin' happens, and he shows himself like one of Minsky's broads. Then ya know that fella.
The worms'll be feastin' on that fat gut of yours before Charlie Luciano shows his ass.
That's just my problem.
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
So tell me when I ain't done it.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
 Tell me, Charlie. Please.
Why should I go against you, Boss? Nobody can handle this business like you. Maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. He's got no business bein' Boss. The idea makes me wanna puke. You're the Boss, an it's gonna stay that way.
So today, maybe I don't kill you Mr. Lucky Luciano.
Ain't had a decent meal in weeks. This fuckin' war's gonna have me skin and bones like you boys.
These fools would have me dead. Anything, Charlie. Tell me what you want.
Trust me.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
They do what I tell 'em.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
The terms will be mine.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
You disrespect our tradition.
Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
Charlie!
I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
I will not interfere with you.
I am sorry for what I had to do.
Forget it. That's past.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
Our enemies have infiltrated our family. Do you think it was an accident you almost died? We have to take action. Now.
What are ya thinkin'?
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
You can't fuck with them. They're heads of families!
They're friends of our enemy.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Not if they all die at once.
I call a meet. Everybody in town but you and Maranzano. A peace conference to find an end to the war. They know me. They trust me.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
But that's an hour's drive.
Lobster Fra Diavolo. Spaghetti with red clam sauce. Antipasto. And pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Cassius?
Yeah. Mean and hungry lookin'.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
The kid just called me stupid.
Not stupid. Fat.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
Okay I leave you alone?. I want to take a walk on the beach.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
So, smarty-pants, ya can't even beat an ignorant old man.
An ignorant, old, fat man. But I'll get ya next hand, after I take a leak.
Enough cards.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
Let's go.
Hurry up, Charlie. You're missin' the show.
Operator. I need the police.
Mr. Luciano saw nothing. He was in the men's room at the time of the shooting, washing his hands.
That's a lie!
You fellas want the true facts?
I wasn't washin' my hands. I was takin' a piss!
Honorable men. I welcome you today as your Supreme Ruler. The Boss of All Bosses. Capo di Tutti Capi!
In order to give you my complete and objective leadership, I have turned over all my personal business interests to the other members of my family.
In return for my sacrifice, I will receive a fair and proportionate share of the proceeds of all the families across the country.
Each of you will be part of one of the five families, and the Capo for each family will report personally to me.
Please pay your respects to our noble leaders. Mr. Thomas Gagliano. Mr. Joseph Bonnano. Mr. Joseph Profaci. Mr. Vincent Mangano.
And Mr. Salvatore Luciano, who will supervise the entire operation under my direction.
I ask you now to come forward, to show our unalterable unity as brothers, dedicated only to the highest of human values.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Who hired the bastard?
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
I am your Papa now.
I ain't sure there is a way ta get at Maranzano. Masseria tried for six months and never got a shot.
There's a way. We just ain't thinkin' hard enough.
Charlie?
 I'm doin' business here!
But there's...
Here. That hold a while?
I'm gettin' more like my old man every year.
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
Your friends in London still have that house in the country?
If you wanted to get married, maybe we could honeymoon there.
Is it okay if I go back to work?
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
What's your problem?
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again.
Whatever the department can do, Frank. Let me know.
Just let the press boys think Charlie's ridin' the hearse.
 Park Terrace Hotel.
Herman Coll, please.
 I'm sorry, but we have no Mr. Coll registered, sir.
 Pennsylvania Hotel.
Herman Coll, please.
 I don't find a Mr. Coll in our registry, are you sure...
 Post Hotel.
Herman Coll, please.
 One moment please... That number is busy. Would you care to hold?
 Yes?
 Luciano is dead?
What about a .45?
Just goes ta show, Mad Dog. Don't believe everything ya read in the newspapers.
Even scum like you ain't supposed ta hit a guy at home. Where the people he cares about find refuge from this fucked up world. But then you always said the rules didn't apply ta Mad Dog Coll.
MY GOOD SIR! WHAT DO YOU THINK...
What is it, Grace?
 There are some men here from the Internal Revenue. They say they need to speak to you personally.
I'll be out.
You government people are never satisfied to do something once.
Take him inside.
We don't want to disturb your neighbors.
Kill them! Kill them!
Anything!
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
No way, Charlie.
Up here, Boss.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
Whatever you say, Boss.
No, Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another.
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
Who'll make the rules?
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
I propose we make Charlie Luciano head of our National Commission for the next year. All in favor?
You wanna be Boss, Joe?
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
You scare me, Charlie.
Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
