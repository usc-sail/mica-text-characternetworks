The living room has been prepared for the funeral service, with several rows of chairs laid out.
Would you like to see... Aaron nods his head "yes", as BRIAN begins to open the coffin. Aaron crosses to the coffin. There's a dramatic moment as Aaron moves to the coffin and braces himself for what he's about to see. The coffin opens and Aaron stares long and hard at the body.
Brian... who is that?
Excuse me?
Who is this man I'm looking at? 'Cause it's not my father.
Are you sure?
Are you asking me if I'm sure I know what my father looks like?
People make mistakes in times of grief.
Man, look at the damn body! Brian peers into the coffin. We see it's an ASIAN MAN.
Oh shit! The other undertakers look embarrassed.
Come on, Brian. You know what my father looks like. He used to take you to little league.
I'm sorry, man. I got a little nervous. This almost never happens.
It's happened before?! You mean this is a normal thing?... This isn't Burger King. You can't just mess up my order.
I think I know where he is.
You think?
I better .,see my dad in this coffin in an hour, or you're going to take his place. The undertakers pick up the coffin and shuffle out awkwardly.
Don't worry. I'll get him, man.
You do that.
They brought the wrong body. Can you believe that?
(muffled because of
The wrong body?! Do they know where he is?
They think so. They're getting him now. The thermometer beeps and Michelle removes it from her mouth..
I told you not to use Marshals. But no, you wanted to keep it in the neighborhood. I know Swartz costs a little more, but at least they know where the bodies are. Michelle writes something down on a piece of paper as Aaron crosses the room and sits on the bed.
You were right. Please don't rub it in, not today. I've got so much to worry about. Michelle gets up and heads to the bathroom as Aaron takes out some index cards and looks them over.
Dad insisted on having the funeral here, Mom's crying all the time, Ryan didn't help with anything, not like he ever does! Plus my eulogy sucks. I can't wait until this day is over.
Oh come on, honey. I'm sure it's not that bad.
If it is, at least Dad's too dead to hear it. Michelle exits the bathroom.
Honey, it's going to be fine.
It doesn't matter what I write. All anybody's going to be thinking is "why isn't Ryan doing the eulogy? Even I'm going to be thinking it. She holds him close.
Baby, you're the oldest. You have to do the eulogy. Besides, I think you're just as good a writer as your brother. You just need to let someone read your book. Aaronlooks away.
Soon. It's not ready to be read yet.
I'm sure it's fine. Once the funeral's over, and everything dies
Aaron gives her a look.
Sorry. Look, once this is all over, you know your mom's thinking about selling the house, so you know we've got to get out.of here. Aaron looks a little uncomfortable and heads to the bathroom.
You called them, right? Silence from Aaron in the next room.
Aaron?... You put the down payment on the condo, right?
I said I'd take care of it and I'll take care of it. Michelle looks frustrated and crosses into the bathroom.
You better, because I can't live with your mother anymore. I've done my time, now it's time for your brother to take over. From now on, it's only Christmas and birthdays for us. Once we move, we can concentrate on your writing and our baby. Michelle gets down on her knees and starts unzipping Aaron's pants. Aaron pulls back.
Hey, hey, hey. Are you serious? We have to do this today? Michelle is still on the ground.
Yes. Today's the last day of this cycle.
Can I at least find the body first?
I hate funerals. It's all death, death, death.
I don't think funerals are designed for anybody to really like.
I don't want a regular funeral. When I die, I want people to celebrate my life.
Not me. I want it to be the saddest day ever. I want the stock market to stop. Schools to close. And no garbage pick-up. Derek starts to light a cigarette.
You still smoke?
You used to smoke.
I used to piss my pants too, but I stopped. The only thing I want black is my skin. At least open the window. Derek opens the window very slightly.
I've got enough problems of my own to deal with.
I told you... About the rash...
Got to use condoms.
.on my hand...
Still got to use condoms.
Look at it. Norman pulls up his sleeve and makes Derek look at his wrist, but he doesn't take a great deal of interest.
That's not a rash.
What is it?
I don't know, but it doesn't look right.
Oh, damn. Norman continues to drive. Derek continues to smoke.
If you hate funerals so much why are you coming?
You know why.
Come on, man, leave Elaine alone.
I can't. She's the one.
So you're going to win her back over a dead body?
If I have to.
Are you okay?
Yeah, just a little nervous...
About seeing my dad?
I just don't think I've ever been so openly hated by anyone before.
He doesn't hate you. He just loved Derek.
Great. That makes me feel much better.
At least you know it's not you, so try not to get so nervous when he's around.
I can't help it. He puts me on edge. I feel like I owe him money.
He's going to be more.concerned that his brother-in-law just died. He won't be focused on you. Anyway, when I tell him we're getting married, he'll have to accept you. Elaine takes his hand. As they exchange a loving look, Oscar takes his eyes off the road for just a brief moment. Suddenly there's a BUMP!!! And we see a bicyclist flying over Oscar's car. Oscar screeches to a halt. They jump out of the car.
Oh my God. Are you okay? The guy gets up. He's fine.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Are you sure? Is anything broken? I'm so sorry.
It was my fault. I ran a light. Oscar starts hyperventilating.
I could have killed you. What if you had cracked your head open? I'd have blood on my hands! Elaine shakes him.
Oscar, calm down!
You heard the man, he ran a light. Come on, let's get out of here before he wants to sue. She grabs him and pulls him into the car.
What's taking you so long?
I just started.
You want this baby as much me. Come on.
I'm trying.
If I didn't want you to come, you would have done it five minutes ago.
Do I have to do this today? The door opens and a HOUSEKEEPER sticks her head in.
Who's picking up Uncle Russell?-- Aaron and Elaine quickly pull apart. As the Housekeeper steps back out into the hall.
Oh shit, Uncle Russell. Aaron fixes his pants as he exits the room.
Hello?... How are you?... Okay..
I need you to pick up Uncle Russell.
Uncle Russell?! Damn! He's always in a bad mood.
It's not a mood if he's always in it. It's his personality. Can you do it?
Alright... 'Alright. I'll do it. See you soon. Bye. Norman hangs up irritated.
Come on, man. You know that's my father.
Just trying to be professional. What up, Michelle?
He closes the lid and all four undertakers quietly head off. Aaron looks up and sees his mother, Cynthia, has entered the room. Cynthia is clearly drained and tired. She stares at the coffin.
Mom, how are you feeling?
There were so many things we wanted to do... We were going to go to China.
China? You don't even like Chinese food.
That's not the point. I haven't been feeling good. Who knows how long I'm going to live without him. It happens all the time. One spouse goes and then the next. I mean, it might be different if I had a grandchild to take my mind off of everything.
Cynthia, I-- They all cross to the coffin.
 Come on, Mom. You're healthy. You'll be fine. You've got your friends and family... Cynthia, Aaron and Michelle stand around the coffin.
Where is Ryan? Have you heard from him?
He'll be here soon.
Just seeing that boy's face makes me feel better. I've missed him so much. My baby.
She looks down at the coffin. Aaron turns away frustrated. Michelle gently touches the coffin.
Do you need anything, Cynthia?
Yeah, you can get your hand off my husband's coffin. You're leaving smudge marks. Michelle tries to wipe it off with her sleeve.
Yeah, I found them. The ones in the Valium bottle?... Yeah... I'll get them to you this evening... Can't do this afternoon... It's your fault you left them here... I've got a funeral... My uncle died... Yeah, tragic... No, I haven't taken any. I saw what they did to you... What are they anyway?... The doorbell rings.
I've gotta go, my sister's here... I'll take them with me and stop by after the funeral... Bye. The doorbell rings again.
Hang on! Jeff stands up and we see that he's only half dressed for the funeral. He doesn't have any pants on.
He puts the bottle on the counter then crosses to the door and lets Elaine and Oscar inside.
Hey, what's up?
Do you always open the door half naked? Come on, Jeff. We're going to be late.
I've just got to put my pants on and I'm ready. Oscar is still a little shaky.
Oscar's freaked out. A guy on a bike ran into the car.
It came out of nowhere. I didn't see him. I'm sorry.
It's okay, baby.  Go put your damn pants on.
I'm going. I'm going. Jeff heads off to the bathroom and closes the door. Elaine spots the bottle of Valium on the table and picks it up.
Here. Take this..: It'll calm you down.
What is it?
It's just Valium.  I used to take them all the time... It'll make you feel better, promise.
Are you sure? I mean, I've got to drive.
It'll be okay. I'll drive, honey. Come on, open wide. She pops the pill in his mouth and hands him some water. Oscar swallows. Jeff returns wearing pants.
Ready. Let's do it. Oscar and Elaine leave, Jeff surreptitiously picks up the Valium bottle, puts it in his pocket, then follows them out.
Hello! Mom!
Ryan! Cynthia runs over to Ryan and flings her arms around him. Aaron looks a bit lost in the background with Michelle but they walk over.
I know this is hard, Mom. But you're going to be okay.
You always know exactly what to say, Ryan. I'm so glad you're here.
I'm always here for you, Mom.
I guess if people died every week, we'd see you all the time. Ryan turns to Aaron and Michelle.
Aaron, how are you?
I'm alright.
How was the flight?
Okay. I had to buy the seat next to me because I don't trust the airlines with my bags. And there was a lot of turbulence... I guess that's the thing about flying first class. It doesn't matter how much you pay if the plane crashes, you still end up dead-- uh... Ryan realizes what he's said and stops speaking abruptly. It's too much for Cynthia who rushes upstairs.
"End up dead"?
Oh damn.
I'll make sure she's okay. Michelle heads off upstairs.
There he is.
You didn't tell me the guy was in a wheelchair. UNCLE RUSSELL, an elderly man in a wheelchair, sits in his chair. Norman drives forward and stops alongside the old man. He rolls down his window and speaks very slowly with a huge smile on his face.
Where the fuck have you been, you fat bastard? You're late. If you took any longer I'd be dead, too. The fake smile falls off Norman's face.
It's hard to see Dad like this. But he's in a better place now.
When does dead beat sick?
I guess you're right. This is why I try not to get close to people. There's too much emotion involved.
Well that explains why you never call.
What do you want me to say? Some families talk to each other all the time, some just see each other at funerals. That's us.
I guess it is.
Ryan takes a seat in one of the chairs flanking the coffin. Aaron sits as well.
By the way, I'm going to need that money.
What money?
The money for all this... the funeral. You're supposed to pay half.
What about the insurance?
That's Mom's money.
What about the pension?
That's Mom's money.
Oh.
So we're spliting the cost.
Are we?
Yes. We are.
Oh, okay.
So?
I don't have it right now.
What do you mean, you don't have it? You just bought a first class seat for your bag.
And that's why I don't have any cash.
So, poor old Uncle Eddie...
Yeah. But he was sick for so long. He's much better off now.
Dead? Since when does dead beat sick?
Shut up, Jeff. Jeff turns his attention to Oscar.
I love when you come to family functions, Oscar. Because then Dad focuses all his hate on you. There's no response from Oscar. He looks distantly out the window. The pills are starting to kick in.
Oscar?
Was there a dog in here just now? Elaine looks at Oscar very-strangely.
What? He sniffs.
Dalmatian? No, Schnauzer... A beat.
What the hell are you talking about? Oscar falls silent and just goes back to looking out the window.
There's nowhere to park. Then the small flower delivery van pulls out. Derek points out the newly empty space.
That truck is pulling out. Park there.
Alright. Just as he's about to drive in, another car takes it.
What the hell?
Elaine, I was going to park there.
Are you family, Norman?
Well, no, but I'm like family.
No such thing. Derek leans out the window.
Hi, Elaine.
What are you doing here?
Your father invited me.
Oh please. She grabs Oscar and heads to the house followed by Jeff.
What's happening?
Did you see that?... She totally blew me off. The flower delivery van has been waiting to move forward. It's driver beeps the horn.
I said what's happening? Are we there?. Norman turns around and looks at Uncle Russell.
Aw, damn. I have Uncle Russell. How could I forget about Uncle Russell? Derek has other concerns and the van beeps again.
 Yeah, alright!!
What the hell is going on? Uncle Russell pokes Norman with his cane.
Ow.
.barely even looked.
Norman, now highly irritated, is forced to drive backwards.
It's very green here, isn't it?... Green... Very green... Very... green. Elaine takes Oscar to the side.
Oscar, are you alright?
What do you mean?
All this talking about phantom dogs and things being green... What's going on?
What are you talking about? I' fine . Never been greener. Oscar wanders off, leaving Elaine with Jeff.
Elaine, what's wrong with Oscar?
I don't know. Something's not right... ANGLE ON: Oscar as he wanders around the yard.
I think it's the Valium.
Valium?!
I gave him a Valium at your place. I think he's just not used to it.
Oh, right.
Jeff's face reveals his realization of what's happened. He walks off, leaving Elaine watching Oscar.
You're going the wrong way!
Ow! That hurts.
Stop the car, Norman.
What?
Stop the car. I have to speak with her. I have to speak with Elaine. Norman reluctantly stops the car. Derek gets out.
What about Uncle Russell? I need help with Uncle Russell! It's too late. Derek is gone. The van in front of Norman honks the horn.
What's going on here? Where are we?! We're going to be late! Russell hits him on the arm with his cane.
Ow! Can you please stop doing that?! The van keeps beeping. Norman backs up.
Who are all these people? I don't even recognize half of them.
It's your family. You don't recognize them from the last funeral? Ryan looks around the room.
So what side of the family is he on?
Who?
The guy in the leather jacket. Ryan looks around the room and sees a FOUR FOOT SIX MAN approaching the coffin.
I have no idea. Maybe a friend of Dad's from work or something. Aaron turns to Ryan.
So, you're telling me I'm going to have to pay for the whole funeral?
No I'm telling you you'll have the money in a few months when I get my advance.
I'm not a God damn credit agency! REVEREND DAVIS, a very calm, serene woman, suddenly appears.
Aaron, how are you?
Yes, um... We're just waiting for everyone to arrive, then we can get going. I know you're in a hurry.
Yes, I have two more funerals and a Christening. I don't know what it is about the Spring, but they're either coming in or going out. She laughs, but Aaron and Ryan just look at her. Reverend Davis stands there waiting to be introduced to Ryan.
Have you met my brother, Ryan?
Ah, the writer, of course. I must admit I squeezed this job in because I wanted to meet you. I'm reading "Mama's Secret" right now. Don't tell anybody, I'm not supposed to be reading that kind of stuff.
I'm sure the Lord will forgive you. Aaron is irritated.
No, no, I'm doing the eulogy.
Oh. I thought...
Aaron is the oldest. The reverend tries her best not to look disappointed.
Great... Well, I'll just make sure have everything I need.
She looks at the coffin and then at the Bible in her hands.
We've got a body and a Bible. Well, I'm all set. She walks off.
Look, I think you should do the eulogy. Everyone's expecting you to do it.
No, they're not. You're the oldest. You should do it.
Look most of the people are here for Dad, but let's not kid ourselves. A lot of them are here to hear your eulogy.
So imagine how surprised they'll be when they hear yours. Ryan walks away.
How's my little sister?
I'm trying to hold it together, Duncan. He was a really good husband. My friends always told me about the crap their husbands put them through. I never had to deal with any of that. Remember when Uncle Matt got that nanny pregnant?
That was horrible.
They don't make 'em like my Edward anymore. A good husband and a great father to two healthy, strong boys. Michelle cringes in the background.
Coffee can do many things Michelle, but it can't bring back the dead. Beat.
Tea?
Honey, we still need to finish that thing. Remember today is the last day.
Can we talk about this when there's a little less death in the air?
No. No we can't.
Honey, I'm just not in the mood...
I don't have any panties on.
What? You don't have any panties on? It's my father's funeral.
I'm just trying to help you out. I'll put them back on before the service starts. Now come on. They turn. Aaron looks around the corner into the living room and sees the four foot six man standing by a table. Aaron stops Michelle.
Babe, don't make it obvious, but that guy in the leather jacket standing by the wall. Don't look. Don't look. Don't look. Michelle catches a glimpse of the guy.
Do you recognize him?
Isn't that the guy from the Home Depot?
No, I don't think so. Don't look. Don't look.
Did he put in the cable?
No, no, that's not it. He keeps looking at me. Don't look. Don't look.
He's probably just a friend of your father's. I'll meet you in the garage. We have a few minutes before Uncle Russell gets here. Michelle walks off. Aaron peeks around the corner again and makes eye contact with the four foot six inch man, who seems to be staring straight at him. Aaron averts his eyes and heads off.
What are you doing?! Be careful with that. Uncle Russell bangs his cane on the floor impatiently.
Hurry up, we're late. Norman slams the trunk closed.
Ryan stops Aaron.
Oh, Ryan can you keep an eye out--
God damn, that Martina has grown up. ANGLE ON: MARTINA, nineteen and attractive.
Are you talking about Little Martina?
She was like a teenager when I left, and now she's... you know. She's like damn. Aaron looks distastefully at his brother.
Can you keep an eye out for Uncle Russell?
I think I should go see how she's been.
Yeah, why don't you do that? See if she wants a juice box.
Ryan heads off towards Martina. Aaron continues across the room.
Hi there. Aaron turns and finds himself cornered by Frank.
Hello.
I was really sorry to hear about your dad. He talked about you a lot. I saw your wedding pictures. Your wife's dress was very beautiful. Aaron is a little uncomfortable.
Uh... thanks.
Did he ever mention me?... Frank? Frank steps forward and holds out his hand. Aaron shakes it.
Frank?... I don't think so, no... Were you a friend of his?
Something like that, yeah. Michelle sticks her head out of the kitchen.
Honey. Can I see you for a moment?
Well, nice to meet you. Thanks for coming. Aaron walks away, leaving Frank alone.
Come on, put your back into it. You're supposed to be a young man. Don't you have any strength?
I think we should get started. really have to leave at three.
Sure. Can we just wait five minutes for my Uncle Russell? We can't start without him.
.Of course.
It's so nice to see you.
I'm so sorry to hear about your uncle. But he's in a better place now. I hear Ryan is doing the eulogy. Oscar, carrying a leaf, interrupts the conversation.
Look... Isn't it beautiful? He wanders off again. Elaine doesn't know what the hell is going on.
Elaine, can I speak to you for a minute?
 I'll see you inside. Jeff takes Elaine's arm with some urgency and moves off to the side.
What? What is it?!
I have to tell you something and, I'm warning you in advance, you're not going to like it. Elaine looks at Jeff concerned.
Aaron. How are we doing on time?
As soon as Uncle Russell gets here we'll be ready to start.
So what's this I hear about Ryan not doing the eulogy?
I was just telling him how much I'm looking forward to hearing your eulogy.
That's a shame. I mean, I'm sure you'll be good, Aaron. It's just with Ryan being the writer of the family...
Yeah.
There are people here that don't even know your father. They just came to hear Ryan.
Would you excuse me? Aaron walks away.
Are you alright?
Every single person wants Ryan to do the eulogy. He was my father, too. I'm supposed to do the damn eulogy! I'm the oldest. Where was Ryan when I was taking care of Dad?
Calm down. Calm down. Forget about everyone. You're going to do the eulogy and it's going to be the best eulogy anyone's every heard. Now could you please do me a favor and get me pregnant?
Come on, do I have to do this today?
Yes. What do you want? You want me to talk dirty? I'm gonna suck it. I'm gonna to suck it. Before Michelle can continue her PG rated dirty talk, there is a knock on the door.
Is there more soda in here?
Yes! Come in! Michelle is frustrated.
What do you mean it's not Valium?
I mean what you thought was Valium, wasn't actually Valium. It's a hallucinogenic. Like, acid, mescaline... Special K... Oscar moves in the background behind Elaine and Jeff. Elaine looks at him. He's making strange contorted expressions with his face and pointing at the sky. Other people are starting to notice him and think he's slightly odd.
This isn't funny, Jeff.
I'm not being funny. Look at him, he's high as a kite! Oscar sticks his head into a huge bush.
What the hell are you doing leaving that stuff around your house?!
A friend left it. And who the hell just goes into someone's house and takes pills?
I thought they were Valium!  What am I supposed to do? Should I tell him?
No, don't do that. It'll just freak him out... We'll just keep a close eye on him, and make sure he doesn't get out of control... And don't let him spend too long talking to one person... or bush. Oscar wanders into the front door. Elaine quickly follows him. Jeff reluctantly follows Elaine. Derek arrives in time to see this and follows as well.
Hi, Dad. How are you? She gives him a kiss.
Not bad considering we're at a funeral. Jeff steps forward.
Hi, Dad. He shakes his hand.
How's Pepperdine treating you? Is Professor Clarke still giving you a hard time?
No, no. It's all worked out. Don't worry.
I'm not worried about you. Duncan looks pointedly at Elaine, irritating her. Duncan looks at Oscar who is in the background.
So I see you brought your friend.
He's my boyfriend. And you know his name. Derek approaches.
Doctor, how nice to see you again.
Derek. How are you doing at the hospital?
Great. Great. We should have lunch soon. I'd love to hear what you think about the new pediatric wing at Cedar's.
Definitely. Maybe Elaine would like to join us for lunch? They both look expectantly at Elaine who looks away disgusted. Cynthia comes up to them and kisses Elaine and Jeff hello. Oscar stares at her.
Elaine... Jeff... good to see you.
I'm so sorry, Auntie. We're going to miss Uncle Edward so much.
Yeah. He was a great guy.
Thank you.
Oscar, this is my Aunt-- Oscar grabs Cynthia in a tight hug.
I'm so sorry about... the death... He sings "Amazing Grace" softly as Duncan, Derek, Jeff and Elaine look on.
Amazing Grace / How sweet the sound / That saved a wretch like me... Cynthia untangles herself from Oscar. She heads back outside. Duncan gives Elaine a look, then heads off after Cynthia.
What are you going to do?
I don't know. I can't leave. Aunt Cynthia would never speak to me again. Jeff notices that Oscar has left. He rushes outside. Elaine follows. Derek follows suit.
You look nice, Elaine.
I'm dressed for a funeral.
Yeah, but you make death look sexy. She looks at him.
So, I heard about the engagement.
Hey, hey. I don't really have time to deal with whatever happened between you and me. But I have not told my dad yet, so I would appreciate it if you would keep your mouth shut.
Sure. Anything for you. Derek looks over and notices Oscar looking bewildered.
So that's him? That's the man you're going to spend the rest of your life with? Elaine looks over at the drugged up Oscar. Oscar leans over like he's on a nod. Jeff leans down with him, watching. Right before Oscar falls over, he comes up really fast.- Then he starts walking.
Yep, that's him. Oscar who has been walking in circles with a look of awe on his face, changes direction and flies by Elaine and Derek back into the house with Jeff in tow.
Elaine., I- Elaine follows the guys, leaving Derek behind.
My father was an exceptional man... My father was-- Frank again approaches Aaron.
Actually, there's something I'd like to talk to you about... when you have a minute. Aaron hears Uncle Russell in the background.
Yeah, that's great. Do you mind if we do it later though? My uncle just got here.
Sure. Aaron heads off.
Thank you, Derek, you're a life saver. Hope it wasn't too much trouble.
No problem at all. Aaron wheels Uncle Russell inside.
How are you doing, Uncle Russell?
Terrible. Derek follows, leaving Norman standing there out of breath.
Can I get a little help?
Ladies and gentlemen, could you all kindly take your seats? We're about to begin the service. Ryan helps Martina to her seat. Jeff keeps an eye on Oscar. Elaine grabs Oscar and drags him to a seat. Aaron wheels Uncle Russell to his place.
Move! Move! He pokes people with his cane. Aaron then takes his seat with Michelle. Oscar is not looking so good. Ryan finally ends the conversation with Martina and heads to his seat. Reverend Davis is about to start, but waits as Norman, sweating, pushes through the crowd to his seat. The reverend waits for the disturbance to end, so Norman attracts the attention of everyone. Norman takes his seat next to Derek. Derek leans away.
Family and friends, we're gathered here today to mourn the passing of Edward Barnes.
Yeah, well, you left me to push Uncle Russell up that damn hill all by myself. Then took all the credit.
Elaine, turns around.
Norman, shut up. Elaine turns back around. Norman is irritated by this.
I'd like to start with a favorite passage of Edwards from First Samuel chapter 18, verses 1-4 in the King James Bible.
'Cause you're not.
 Stole your parking space?!. My father's dead! Act right. Reverend Davis looks at them then continues her speech.
."Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul..." As she speaks, Norman looks at his wrist, worried. The woman sitting next to him smacks his wrist down. ANGLE ON: Elaine looks at Jeff who watches Oscar. Oscar is fidgeting and looking worried. ANGLE ON: Aaron and Michelle. Aaron looks worried.
."And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword and to his bow, and to his girdle." ANGLE ON: Oscar is laughing. Elaine tries to control him.
And now we'll have a few words from Edward's son, Aaron. Ryan's older brother. ANGLE ON: Aaron as he gathers himself. Michelle gives Aaron a supportive squeeze of the arm. Aaron looks over and sees Frank staring at him. ANGLE ON: Uncle Russell.
Why isn't Ryan doing the eulogy? This is bullshit.
Aaron arrives at the front and looks out across the expectant crowd. He's extremely nervous.
Good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you for coming... I never realized Dad was so popular. It looks like he's got more friends now that he's dead. Blank faces stare back at Aaron. Cynthia looks pained. Everyone is silent except for Oscar who laughs loudly. Elaine silences him with a look. Aaron composes himself and pulls his notes out.
My father was an exceptional man... He was born in 1938. He grew up in Alabama on a farm. He loved to take long walks in the woods with his close friend, Bobby. He told me how they spent their summer days riding their bikes through the fields and swimming in the lake. As Aaron speaks, Reverend Davis looks concerned because the eulogy is so bad. She looks to Ryan who looks like "what can I do?" Jeff looks more concerned with Oscar, whose face is contorted with pain. He looks like he's going to burst. ANGLE ON: Aaron.
Dad's first job was working after school as an assistant to an electrician named Mr. Thompson. Back then, Blacks weren't allowed to wear rubber gloves. So my father got shocked a lot. Because of that, he had no feeling in his fingertips. I asked my Dad what his first boss was like... The drugs have gotten the best of Oscar. He suddenly grabs Elaine's arm. Aaron keeps talking.
Did you just see that?
See what?
The coffin just moved.
What?
I'm telling you I saw it move. Aaron becomes vaguely aware of the disturbance, but battles on with his eulogy.
.He said he was a nice man, and surprisingly well dressed. When Dad was eighteen, he left home after an argument with his father. He never told me what that argument was about, but I do know that after leaving South Carolina, sadly he and Bob lost touch and never saw each other again. Dad went to college where he studied accounting, a decision which lead to a career in corporate finance... But his real passion was for the arts, with a particular fondness for theatre, dance and musicals. He was a charter member of the Negro Ensemble Company and contributed regularly to the Alvin Ailey School of Dance. Oscar's protests are getting louder. Duncan looks back at the disruption with a disapproving glare. Elaine looks at Jeff who watches, concerned.
There, look. It happened again.
Oscar, please- People start looking at Oscar, who's becoming increasingly vocal, and looking increasingly like someone on acid.
That coffin's moving!
There's someone alive in there!
Oscar, please sit down. Oscar ignores her and walks purposefully towards the coffin. People watch him in astonishment, including Jeff.
What the hell is wrong with you people?! Oscar approaches the coffin as Aaron steps off the dais. Elaine tries to hold Oscar back, but she can't.
What are you doing?
There's someone moving in there. Can't you see? Oscar tries to open the coffin. Aaron and Elaine try to restrain him, but can't. A tussle begins. Ryan jumps in to help.
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Ryan, no!
Elaine attempts to grab Ryan. Duncan stands up and tries to help.
Get away from there!
No, I have to show you! He's alive! He's alive! The scene descends into absolute chaos with people pushing and struggling. Finally, the coffin falls off the platform and tips over. The dead body of Edward rolls out onto the floor at the feet of Cynthia. Cynthia screams. Aaron freezes in shock. Michelle takes Cynthia through the kitchen. The living room is left in chaos.
It's alright, Cynthia. It's alright. She sits in a chair crying uncontrollably. Aaron is so angry, he just marches out.
Please let me extend my apologies to you all. I understand the incident you just witnessed was quite shocking, but everything will be... returned... to it's proper place. Please enjoy the refreshments, and we'll call you when we're ready to continue.
It wouldn't have happened if Ryan had done the eulogy. Aaron exits through the garden door.
Elaine, what the hell was that?!
I'm so sorry, Aaron.
Oh, okay. My dead father's sprawled out on the living room floor, but it's okay, you're sorry.
But the coffin was moving.
Please, Aaron. Go back inside. I'll explain later. An annoyed and confused Aaron turns and walks back to the house. He's almost to the door when Michelle arrives.
No, I haven't made the call about the down payment yet.
I wasn't going to say that.
No I'm not going to have sex with you.
I wasn't going to say that.
What were you going to say?
I'll kill him! Elaine tries to keep Duncan away from Oscar, who is stressed enough and looks terrified.
Dad, leave it alone!
Leave it alone?! He just knocked my brother-in-law out of his coffin.
It wasn't his fault.
Yes it was. My sister is in tears. I can't believe you brought this idiot! I don't ever want to see him again, do you understand me?
I can't do that.
Why not?
Because we're... moving in together. Duncan looks over at Oscar, who looks like he's just seen a ghost. He's struggling to stand up straight, with Jeff who's doing his best to look after him.
Are you crazy?
Dad, this isn't actually what he's like. He took some drugs and--
Drugs?! Is he on the pipe?
Jeff looks over, his eyes pleading with Elaine not to tell on him.
No he's not on the pipe. He took some Valium and had a.bad reaction. Jeff looks grateful.
Valium?! That's not a Valium high. Your mother was on Valium for forty years. She never knocked over a coffin.
Dad, please.
I just want to point out that you won't see Derek knocking over a coffin.
Not right now, Dad.
Fine. I've got to check on Cynthia, but this isn't over. Duncan walks back to the house. Elaine walks over to Oscar who is hugging a tree.
Oscar.
Elaine.
Come and sit down.
Are you alright?... That was insane. He just fell out the coffin like a dead fish. I guess its not much of a metaphor when you're talking about a dead human, but--
Aaron looks at Norman.
Norman, please.
Oh yeah... Sorry. It's just that you never know when it's your time. Like, I have this weird thing on my wrist. I've had it for a few weeks now. I don't know what it is--
Why don't you show it to my Uncle Duncan? He's a doctor.
He is? Great. Thanks. Norman walks off toward the kitchen. He passes Uncle Russell and Ryan talking to Martina.
I read your last book, "Black Hurt."
Good, good. Thanks a lot.
I'm not giving you a compliment you arrogant bastard. What a load of bullshit. I wouldn't wipe my ass with it. Ryan leads Martina away from Uncle Russell.
I swear it was moving. I must be losing my mind...  Why are my hands so big?!
Oscar, listen to me. I need to tell you something... Elaine sits him down on the bench.
What is it?
Now... You remember I gave you some Valium earlier?
Yes.
Well it turns out that it wasn't actually Valium. Oscar just looks at Elaine. Jeff slinks off into the background.
Can you hear me?
Hello, Doctor, I know this is a bad time, but I've got this thing on my hand. I've had it for weeks now... Duncan is looking at Norman incredulously.
What do you think it is? Cynthia stands up.
Duncan, I'm going back now. She exits. Reluctantly, Duncan answers Norman.
You should probably go see a dermatologist. He turns to follow his sister out, but Norman pulls him back.
Really? Why? What do you think it is?
I don't know. It looks like some kind of pigment mutation. Duncan walks further out of the room.
Pigment mutation?! Duncan turns again.
You're probably just allergic to something. Maybe from shellfish, nuts... Duncan heads further out of the room, but Norman won't give up.
Nuts? What kind of nuts? Duncan turns around again.
I don't know. Pecans? Peanuts?... Excuse me. Duncan finally exits, leaving Norman looking shocked and terrified.
Do you understand? Hallucinogenic. Oscar recoils. He turns to Jeff.
Yeah, now, the best thing to do is relax and just go with the flow. Try and enjoy it.
Oscar stands up, panicked and grabs Jeff by the lapels. We see the bottle of "Valium" falls out of his pocket.
You!
Oscar! She tries to pull him off Jeff.
How long does it last?
I don't know... eight hours?
Eight hours?! Of this?!!
Oscar let go. She pulls him off Jeff. ANGLE ON: Derek watching from the window.
I'm going to be sick. ANGLE ON: Derek smoothing his hair seeing his opportunity. ANGLE ON: Oscar runs inside. Elaine follows with Jeff in tow.
Oscar! Come back. They head into the house.
Oh, hi, Elaine. You following me? She just runs right past, then Jeff rushes past following Elaine. Oscar pushes through people.
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.
Elaine grabs Oscar and leads him to the stairs.
Excuse me. He's going to be sick. They head up the stairs with Jeff following.
Oscar. Oscar grabs the hair-dryer and wields it like a gun.
Stand back!
Oscar, put down the dryer.
Get back or I'll blow your head off. Oscar backs Elaine out of the bathroom.
Oscar, please-- Oscar shuts the door and locks it.
Oscar, are you okay? She tries to open the door, but it's locked. Jeff walks up checking his pockets.
Oscar, let me in.
Jeff realizes he lost the pill bottle.
Oscar. Oscar?
Uh... Elaine... I can't find the pill bottle? But Elaine is too busy to hear.
Oscar! Open the door. Jeff looks at the floor as he leaves.
Okay. Breathe.
Snap out of it! You can handle this. You can do this. He runs the tap and splashes some water on his face.
Alright. You're okay. Stay calm... Stay calm... Oscar is still staring at himself in the mirror.
That's it, Oscar, keep it together. K.I.T. Keep it together. K.I.T. Keep it together. Everything's going to be fine. Nothing moved. Dead people don't move. They're stiff. They don't move, do they?
(he screams at himself in the
Easy now. Easy now. We can do this. A few hours. That's nothing. No sweat. I mean you've already been in here for... He looks at his watch.
Where's my watch?! He sees it's on the other wrist.
Oh! He checks the time.
It's already been...
Open the door. Oscar.
Five minutes. Suddenly the pressure of. the situation overtakes him.
God damn! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!
It's alright. Aaron turns around not knowing what to do.
Grief does strange things to people. Aaron looks at him a little freaked out by his sudden appearance.
I guess so.
If you remember, I have something to talk to you about.
Oh yeah.
Is there somewhere private we could go?
Sure. They walk away. The screaming continues as Jeff, frantically, but slowly comes down the stairs re-tracing his steps and searching around for his lost bottle of pills.
Are you writing a novel?
Uh... yeah. Aaron takes the manuscript and moves it away.
Like your big brother.
Actually I'm the oldest. I was writing before.he was. I've had a few pieces published in the New Yorker. But now I'm mainly teaching.
Oh. Well, you must be very proud of your brother then. Getting all his novels published. Aaron decides to move the conversation on.
So anyway. What did you want to talk about? He motions for Frank to take a seat and sits across from him.
Your father and I were very... close.
Yeah. Okay. That's good.
And we spent a lot of time together.
Yeah, well Dad was a fun guy. Frank takes an envelope out of his inside jacket pocket and takes some photos from the envelope.
Um... I've got some photos I want to show you.
Sure. Frank passes the first photo.
That's me and your Dad in Central Park in New York. Aaron looks at the photo curiously.
That's us on Santa Monica Boulevard on Halloween... Aaron takes the next one, becoming more suspicious.
So, where did you and my dad meet?
Just around.
Oscar. Are you alright?
Ahhh. He smacks his lips together and then opens his mouth and waits for the next drop.
That's one of me and your father going to the premiere of "Dreamgirls". I was dressed as Deena and your father had to be Effie. Aaron looks at the photo of them dressed in drag.
So... I mean you have all these pictures, but he never said anything about you. This is the first I'm
Frank gives Aaron a knowing look.
How did you know my father? Aaron looks around the room. There is a copy of "People Magazine" sexiest men issue on the table. He sees figurines of male ballet dancers. It's getting clearer. He sees three Robert Mapplethorpe photos on the wall. There's a signed Kathy Griffin 8x10. Frank looks around waiting for him to get it. Aaron looks at a framed movie poster for Australia with Hugh Jackman. Aaron looks back at the picture. He gets it.
Oh God... Aaron jumps up and closes the study door.
Are you really that shocked? Frank gestures around the room.
I had no idea.
I'm sorry. I'm sure he would have eventually told you, but I guess he wasn't sure how you'd react. Aaron shakes in disgust.
Uugg. Like this. Aaron gathers his senses. He has a thought and turns to Frank.
Does my mother know?
No. And there's no reason why she should... Just as long as I get what's owed to me.
A long pause. Aaron looks over at Frank.
"What's owed to you"?
Well, obviously I should get something... I mean, your dad and I were lovers, and he left me absolutely nothing in his will. How do you think that makes me feel? Aaron fails to respond, because he's in too much shock.
I'll tell you how it makes me feel cheap. Like some cheap piece of ass... I mean, I'm entitled to something.
What do you want?
What I want is a lot, but I'm not asking you for what I want. I deserve thirty thousand dollars.
Thirty thousand dollars?! I can't just give you thirty thousand dollars. My wife and I are trying to have kids--
Your father told me you were having trouble...
You think you can come in here, slander my father's name and show me a few photos of you and my dad dressed up going to see "Dreamgirls"? I saw "Dreamgirls" twice. I'm not gay. That's not proof of anything... "Steppin' to the bad side / Gonna take a mean ride."
Aaron grabs Frank and pushes him against the wall.
I'm not giving you anything but a-- Frank pulls out another photo and holds it up to Aaron's face. Aaron,releases Frank and snatches the picture.
Now I don't want to, but I will show these photos to your mother... Do you really want me to do that today?
Wait here. He exits the study.
Oscar. Open the door. Derek arrives behind her and leans in close.
Anything I can do to help?
Not really, thanks. Derek moves over to face her and leans his arm on the door very coolly.
I guess you've got it under control. Elaine ignores him and continues banging on the door.
Oscar? Anguished noises emanate from the bathroom.
Oscar! Open the door.
So what are you doing after the funeral? I've got Maxwell tickets.
Look... I'm busy. I don't have time for your shit. Now get the hell away from me! Derek looks hurt and storms off.
Oscar!
.so you've never been to New York?
I've been with my parents once.
Oh, that's not really seeing New York. You have to come visit me. When's your birthday?
I turn eighteen next month.
Great. All star weekend is in New York this year.
I know. I know. Aaron approaches.
Ryan, I need to talk to you.
Not now, Aaron.
It's important.
Give me five minutes. Aaron pulls him away.
What are you doing? What is it? Aaron lowers his voice.
That guy that was here before, that we didn't recognize...
The guy in the leather jacket?
Yeah.
What about him? Aaron lowers his voice further.
Well, I was just with him in the study, and... and he showed me some pictures...
So? He showed you some picture? What's wrong with that? I'm busy...
Pictures of him and Dad together at the premiere of "Dreamgirls". Ryan's face is blank. It's not registering.
Look, is this going anywhere, Aaron?
Ryan, he was Dad's lover!
What? No, no, no.
The guy in the leather jacket just showed me pictures of him and Dad together.
No, no, no. I don't believe that. My father is not gay. I've known him my whole life. And he's the most non-gay man I've ever met. Matter fact, he's so straight he makes me seem gay. And I know I'm not gay-- Aaron pulls out the picture.
Uugg.
Uugg. I know.
Uugg/Uugg. Aaron nods.
How can she be more interested in that idiot than me? Women. They don't know what they want! Norman's still examining his arm.
It sounds serious, doesn't it?
What?
A pigment mutation. Derek gives Norman a disparaging look. Norman picks up some cake and takes a bite.
Ooh, will you try this cake? I think it might have nuts in it.
So?
 So?... Aaron's uncle says I might be allergic to nuts...
Then don't eat nuts. Put the cake down.
I can't not eat the cake. That's what I do when I'm stressed. I eat cake.
I bet you won't eat it when your arm falls off. Norman sniffs the cake.
Will you just try it and tell me if there's nuts in it?
No.
Come on.
I don't want to.
Just do me a favor-- Norman is pushing the cake towards Derek's mouth.
Get away from me. Derek gets up and walks off, leaving Norman spitting out the cake. From under the table, Jeff pops up.
You haven't seen a pill bottle around, have you? A Valium pill bottle?
No. But can you try this-- Jeff smiles nervously and goes back to his search on the floor. Jeff slides across the floor past Uncle Russell sitting at the other end of the table. An OLDER LADY turns to Russell.
Edward and I watched the Tony Awards every year. We would get all dressed up and sip cocktails. I'm going to miss him so much.
Don't worry. The way you look, you won't be far behind. The mourner looks shocked. Jeff continues his search along the floor.
I'm sure we'll start soon. He looks toward the house and sees Norman exit. Duncan wants to avoid him.
In a moment. Duncan gets up and heads toward the house. He passes Norman.
Doctor, I just have a-- Duncan doesn't stop, leaving Norman holding his wrist. Norman looks over and sees Cynthia. He sits next to her.
I'm sorry... you know... about... you know...
Thank you. I'll be alright. I know he's watching over me.
You think so?' I mean, there are a lot of fine ones up in heaven. Anna Nicole Smith's dead too, you know. might be watching over her. Norman sits next to Cynthia.
Death is a terrible thing... Did you check to make sure he.was wearing shoes? I hear they steal the shoes. And I hope you took off his ring, 'cause if it's worth anything, someone is going to take that, too. Cynthia stares at Norman.
Before he died, did he have a rash? She gets up and exits. Norman notices Jeff's pill bottle on the ground. He picks it up and puts it in his pocket.
You don't understand. If we don't give him the money, he's going to show Mom the picture.
Okay. Let me think, let me think. Ryan is trying to come up with a solution.
I think you should pay him the money.
What do you mean, you think I should pay him the money? Where the hell is all your money?
I'm in debt up to my ass. I'm broke, man!
So after paying for the funeral, the clothes, the catering... Now I'm supposed to shell out thirty thousand dollars? He's your father, too.
You're the oldest. Besides, you've been living off Mom and Dad long enough. You must have some money saved. You haven't paid rent in two years.
I have not been living off of them... I've been living with them.
No I haven't paid rent, but Dad hasn't worked in five years. Who do you think has been paying all the bills?
Well if you've got money problems and I've got money problems, what can we do? Fuck him! Aaron shows Ryan the photo again.
You've got to pay him.
Yes, yes. Keep coming. Join the others. Join the others.
Oscar?
Oscar?
Oscar? She tries the door. It's still locked.
Oscar?
Oscar?
Oscar.
Oscar.
Os...
.car.
Are you alright?
No, my nephew is dead and these bastards ate all the potato salad. Nearby mourners look appalled. The reverend looks over and sees Aaron and Ryan coming down the kitchen corridor. She approaches them.
Ah! I think we're just about ready to start the service, so-
Would you mind giving us five minutes?
Thanks. Aaron walks off followed by Ryan. He passes Michelle, who's sitting on the couch. She stands up.
Is everything okay?
No. I'm really sorry, honey, but buying a condo is going to have to be put on hold, just for now.
What are you talking about? Why?
Babe, you know I wouldn't do this unless I had a good reason.
What's the reason?
I haven't got time right now, please. I'll explain later.
Aaron walks off to join Ryan, who's at the door of the study.
Hey, hey, hey! Aaron rushes over and takes the manuscript away from Frank.
What are you doing with my manuscript?! It's not ready. He puts it in the desk.
Well, you left it on a coffee table.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, when you put things on coffee tables, it's assumed it's for everybody.
It kind of is...
Can we get to the point here?
Fine by me. Aaron is now extremely irritated. He exchanges a look with Ryan confirming that there's no other way out.
Deal. Aaron sits down at the desk and reluctantly takes out his check book. He starts writing.
What?
The novel... it's a first draft?
Yeah. So?
No, nothing. Aaron continues to write the check.
I tried writing once... Didn't work for me, either. I think it's just a gift. You either have it or you don't... It must be hard for you though, especially since your younger brother is such a great writer.
Your father and I read "Black Hurt" together. Truly amazing. We loved it. He was so proud of you.
Thanks... I guess... Aaron rips the check into little pieces.
That's it. I can't do it.
Aaron, what are you doing?
There's no way in the world I'm giving him my hard earned money.
Don't be stupid. Not today. I'll pay you back as soon as my money comes in.
He comes in today! Of all days, he picks the day of my father's funeral! Who the hell is he?
He has the pictures!
So what. Who cares what he's got. Let him show the world. Put it on facebook. I don't care.
Let's just get it over with. There's a long pause as everyone seems to be deciding what to do. Finally, Frank stands up.
Fine. This is on your head. Frank heads towards the door.
What? No, wait.
Ryan rushes to stand in front of the door, blocking Frank's
Get out of my way.
Let's just discuss this a minute.
There's nothing to discuss. Frank grabs the door and tries to open it.
Get out of my way. He tries to push past, but Ryan covers his mouth, muffling his cries.
Ryan, what are you doing?
Get off me! Ryan is trying to muffle Frank's screams.
Aaron, help me! Ryan is holding Frank down and trying to keep him quiet.
Ah!!
Aaron, you got any rope or duct tape?
What?! I'm not a serial killer. I don't keep rope and duct tape in my pocket.
Well just grab something!  There, from the curtains. Aaron grabs the cord that's tied around the curtains. He holds it over the wrestling duo, but Ryan's hands are occupied with Frank.
Tie his legs. Aaron grabs his legs and in doing so falls on top of Frank as well. As he wraps the curtain cord around Frank's legs...
This is a really bad idea.
Men.
Tell me about it... How's Aaron?
How would I know? He's been avoiding me all day. We're trying to get pregnant. But I can't really do that by myself, can I? I feel like I'm making him eat brussel sprouts every time we do it. Elaine looks at her.
The guy's father just died. Don't you think this is a bad day for sex?
Don't you think I know that?
I'm sorry. At least your husband didn't ruin the funeral.
It's a funeral, it's already ruined. When you start off with a dead guest of honor, how much worse can it get?
Get that tie. Aaron grabs the necktie from off the desk.
What am I supposed to do with the tie?
Whatever you do with a tie.
I don't know what to--
Just stuff it in his mouth! Damn, I have to do everything?
Apparently everything but write a damn check.
Suddenly the door opens and Norman enters.
Aaron, do you know what was in this cake, I- ANGLE ON: Frank who looks at Norman bug eyed hoping he'll help.
Shut the goddamn door! Shocked, Norman does as he's told. It takes Norman a moment to register that Aaron and Ryan are sitting on top of Frank. Frank continues screaming through the cloth.
What is going on? Who is that guy? Ryan thinks quickly.
He's having a seizure.
I just found some Valium outside. Would that help?
Yeah. Great. Give him some. Frank shakes his head "no." Norman gets on his knees with the guys and opens the bottle.
It's okay. This should help. calm you down. Frank tries to protest, but can't. Ryan holds Frank's mouth open as Aaron holds his nose closed. Norman pours a few pills into Frank's mouth, then Ryan holds Frank's mouth shut. Suddenly the door opens again and Jeff walks in.
Have you seen a little brown pill bottle lying around-- They all turn to Jeff. Frank looks at him, hoping this time he'll get saved.
Norman! I told you to lock the damn door.
You said "shut the damn door." Jeff locks the door and looks shocked.
What's going on?
He's having a seizure.
Why is he all tied up? No one knows what to say.
He's blackmailing you? Over what?
If I could tell everybody, it wouldn't be blackmail.
Look, just trust us. He's the bad guy. We'll explain later.
What are you going to do with him? Everyonerealizes they have no answer to this question.
Yeah, Ryan, what are we going to do with him? Ryan doesn't have any answers.
I don't know.
You don't know?! Come on, you're the big writer. You're the one who came up with "Black Hurt." Dream up something where we all live happily ever after. We can't keep him tied up forever. How long do you think those Valium are going to last?
Valium?
Yeah, I found that bottle of Valium. We gave him a few to calm him down. Norman hands him the bottle.
Ah shit! Jeff stands up and heads over to the door.
What?
What is it?
The thing is... those pills aren't really Valium. It's acid and... acid.
What?!
Oscar took one by mistake. That's why he's acting crazy.
Jeff, what the hell are you doing with this stuff?
A friend left them at my place.
What friend, Amy Winehouse?
Wait, you're telling us that Elaine's boyfriend, who knocked over our father's coffin, had just one of these things...
Five.
Five?!  Poor bastard.
I thought they were Valium. They all turn and look at Frank who is looking back at them, increasingly concerned by whatever conversation they are having, and the pitying expressions on their faces.
Maybe we should call an ambulance.
You can't do that. I'll go to jail.
He's right. If anyone finds out this guy's been force fed acid, we could all be arrested.
So what then? What's going to happen? Is he going to die?!
No... I don't think so... I doubt it.. Probably not...
The moment is broken by someone trying the door, followed by a knock.
Ryan?
Aaron?
Are you in there? They look at each other in panic.
Damn.
 Be out in a minute, Mom. Ryan looks at Norman and Jeff.
 Okay. We have to go out there. You two stay in here and watch him. Ryan closes the curtains.
Watch him?! What do you mean, "watch him"?
Just make sure he doesn't escape. Lock the door behind us. We'll deal with him after the funeral. Aaron and Ryan open the study door leaving Norman and Jeff to take care of Frank.
How's it going, Mom?
Reverend Davis wants to talk with you.
Lookie here, brother. I've been patient. We all know it's a virtue, but I'm about done with patience. Now if we don't resume service soon, we're going to need to have a little conversation about my compensation.
Sure. So sorry. Um... can you just give us another five minutes? The reverend doesn't look too pleased.
Five minutes.
Is everything okay, boys? Ryan and Aaron kiss their mother and walk off.
Why didn't you just pay him the money?!
Why did you tie him up?!
Do you want Mom to find out?!
What is wrong with you? They start to argue.
What's your problem?!
Women are my problem.
No such thing as having a woman without a problem. If they didn't have problems, do you think they'd let us touch 'em? Let me tell you something about women. Smarter than you think they are. But not as smart as they think they are.
She acts like she doesn't care that I exist. I mean how can she not feel what I feel?
Really?
Listen here, boy. This is what you do: you walk up to her, slap her--
Slap her? You want me to hit her?
Has not hitting her worked? Look, then you grab her and kiss her. The harder the better.
Are you sure, 'cause that--
Oh, man, I gotta shit. Where's the can? He rolls away quickly.
I can't believe you gave him five. Even if they were Valium, that's too many. I wouldn't give a guy five cough drops. Suddenly they hear the doorknob rattle. Norman and Jeff both look terrified.
Hello?! Neither Norman nor Jeff want to speak. They argue in gestures. Finally Jeff relents.
Hello?
I need the toilet. Jeff and Norman both look panicked. Norman goes to the door.
Can't you use the one upstairs?
I'm in a wheelchair, you idiot! How am I supposed to get up the stairs?!
Open the damn door! Uncle Russell starts banging on the door with his cane.
What are we going to do? They look at Frank who's starting to look high as a kite.
We'll stick him behind the couch.
What the hell is wrong with you people? I'm about to take a dump in my pants!
What do you want, Derek?
I just want to talk.
Please don't make me go through this again.
The only reason you don't want to go out with me is because your dad likes me.
No. The reason I don't want to go out with you is because it was a mistake. I was drunk off my ass. You could have been a donkey.
Thanks.
That wasn't a compliment. I'm saying I couldn't remember it.
Well I remember every minute of it.
A minute, huh? That's why I don't remember.
What is it about this guy? What has he got that I haven't got?
Okay, well for one thing, he's responsible. He's caring. He's considerate. He's thoughtful. He's stable. He's--
I'm not the one who tied him up.
Well somebody had to look out for Mom.
You just can't get over it, can you? You're burning with jealousy because I left and did what you always wanted to do.
I couldn't leave because I had responsibilities.
Don't put it off on responsibilities. You spent three years on a novel and you won't even let anyone see it! What are you going to do? Wait until you're dead? You think you're going to be the Tupac of books?
At least I'm not some hack writing crap. Mr. "Mama's Secret", Mr. "Black Hurt."
Mr. "Out of Ink", Mr. "Blank Page." At least my crap gets published. Michelle enters.
Aaron, what is going on?
Michelle, please, not now.
Why are you acting like this? Fine. We don't have to have sex today, but the condo? Don't you want to get out of here?
Just tell her, Aaron.
Tell me what? Aaron closes the garage door.
Listen... Do you remember the guy in the leather jacket?
Yeah.
Well, I don't know how to say this, but... it looks like he and my father were having sex.
What? No. Not your father. With him?
Yes.
No. Your father was the straightest guy I know.
That's what I thought.
Are you sure?
And now he wants thirty thousand dollars or he's going to show everyone photos of them doing... stuff...
Stuff like what? Aaron and Ryan share a look. Aaron shows Michelle the picture. She reacts.
Hurry up! Norman is struggling to hold Uncle Russell up.
Have you got me?
Yes, I've got you.
Come on, quick, quick, quick.
Alright, I'm trying to see where the toilet is. He maneuvers Uncle Russell to the toilet.
Pants down. Pants down.
No you do it.
How can I do it? I'm handicapped. Norman reluctantly helps Uncle Russell pull his pants down.
Alright. Alright.
Drawers. Drawers. Take down my drawers.
Who calls them "drawers"? Norman pulls them down.
It's all down.
Am I there? Am I there? Norman looks and sees Uncle Russell is right over the toilet.
Yes, yes. Just sit down. Uncle Russell sits down on the toilet trapping Norman's hand underneath and lets loose.
Ooh, that's better. Norman pulls his hand out and looks at it in shock. ANGLE ON: Norman's hand has shit on the fingers. He starts freaking out and screaming.
Ahh!!! Jeff goes into the bathroom to see what's going on.
Ahh!!!
Ugh! Norman, panicking, rushes to the sink, turns on the faucet full blast and sticks his hand under the water. This causes a great splashing.
Norman? Norman? Norman still has his face down.
Please, please. Just come off.
Norman! Norman turns and we see he has shit splattered on his face.
What? Jeff points to his face.
You missed some. Norman turns slowly and looks in the mirror. He freaks out.
Oh, I think I've got some of it in my mouth! Norman desperately rushes to wash it off.
Pull yourself together. Would you rather get caught or have shit in your mouth?! Uncle Russell has fallen asleep on the toilet.
Oh, no. Check him. Check him.
Hey, man, you alright? No response.
Check him again. Check him.
Man. Hey. Hey!
Wake him up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
What's his name?
I don't know. Try Larry. Jeff looks at Norman, but he doesn't have a better idea.
Larry?
Shake him. Jeff bends down and shakes him.
Larry, wake up. It's time to get up. From the bathroom, Uncle Russell starts to stir. Norman quickly closes the door.
Maybe it's not Larry. Try something else. Pinch him. Jeff pinches Frank. Still no response.
He must be breathing. He has to be breathing. Please God let him be breathing.
Jeff looks concerned. He checks for a pulse. He looks up at Norman with an expression that tells us all we need to know.
He's dead.
So that's it? We're just giving him all the money we've saved?
Well, it's not that simple.
Why not?
Aaron refused to pay.
How come you couldn't pay, Ryan?
That's not the point. Besides, the only reason Aaron tore up the check is because the guy started talking bad about his novel.
Your novel? Michelle looks confused.
You let him read your novel? You wouldn't let me read your novel. Are you screwing him, too? 'Cause Lord knows you're not screwing me.
ANGLE ON: Norman as he pastes a maniacal grin on his face and crosses into the living room. As he moves through the throng of mourners, they are all unnerved by him.
Hi. Excuse me. Hi. Pardon me. Hi. The hugesmile never leaves his face. ANGLE ON: Ryan, Aaron and Michelle watching Norman, concerned. Norman approaches and stands on the other side of the coffin.
Norman, why are you grinning like that?
 Can you come to the study for a second? Aaron can see from Norman's face, and the sweat on his forehead, that something serious has happened. Then he sees Cynthia sitting in the corner.
Sure. They exit. Michelle crosses to Cynthia.
Hey, are you doing okay? It's going to be alright.
If you've never given life, child, how can you understand death?
It's Aaron. Jeff opens the door. Norman, Ryan and Aaron enter. Norman locks the door behind them. Aaron rushes over to the body.
Oh shit! Call an ambulance.
There's no point.
What do you mean "there's no point"?!
Look at him! He's dead!
Dead, dead?
Is there a "kind of" dead, Aaron?
What the hell did you do to him?
We didn't do anything!
Well he was alive when I left.
He hit his head on the table.
Oh no. This is really bad. This is really, really bad.
What are we going to do?
Twenty-five to life. Norman looks at his watch.
You know what, I really have to be
Norman makes his way to the door.
You're not going anywhere.
Look, I'm not the prison type. They'll kill me. Oh my God, I'm going to die. I'm going to die in prison. Oh my God, do you know how fast a rash spreads in prison? Aaron smacks Norman.
Pull yourself together! Norman calms down.
Thanks, man. After a beat, Ryan speaks.
Look, no one here knows who this guy is. Nobody knows his name. They probably didn't even notice him.
Didn't notice him? He's four fucking feet tall.
Look, all we have to do is get rid of the body. It'll be like he came and left.
Get rid of the body?! It took me two months to get rid of a couch.
Did any of you happen to notice the size of Uncle Edward's coffin? Everyone looks at Jeff.
Why not?... I mean it's not like he's going to know.
That's not the point.
You have to admit, it makes sense, Aaron. The coffin's there, the hole in the ground's there... He'll be gone, finished, end of story... Unless you have a better suggestion. Aaron desperately tries to think of an alternative.
It's funny. No matter what you say, I'm convinced we'll be together.
Yeah, well, we all make mistakes... I used to be convinced I was going to marry Prince. What happened there?
You still could.
You're an idiot.
I'm serious. You only live once. You might as well do whatever it is that makes you happy.
Yes, but maybe I don't think of life anymore as all about me, me, me. Maybe I've discovered there's something outside of myself that I care about. And maybe you should, too. Derek looks hurt.
That's kind of cold. I care about you.
No, Derek, you care about you. You only care about me in relation to how I affect you. There's a difference.
That's not true, Elaine.
Derek, get over yourself.
Hey! He slaps her on the butt. Elaine whirls around. Derek grabs her on the arms.
I'm the man for you, and you're coming home with me. He kisses her.
What is that?! Elaine turns around.
Oscar!
Oscar! What are you doing? Get back here and put your clothes on right now!
I saw you kissing him.
I wasn't kissing him. I swear. Please, baby, put your clothes on. We're at a funeral! Derek sticks his head out the window behind Elaine.
You cheater! You cheater! You're committing adultery!!!
Calm down.
I'm going to jump right now.
Remember you've got drugs in you. This isn't really happening. Oscar, look at me. She turns to Derek.
I'm going to jump. I'm jumping. You're a cheater!
People gather. around and look up. We only see Oscar from the waist up. ANGLE ON: Oscar.
I'm going to jump. She's cheating on me!
Oscar, please. Come back here.
There's just no way we can do it. It's impossible. Suddenly there's a knock on the door. Everyone freezes.
Norman, it's Derek. Let me in. Everyone freezes.
Oh shit. Put him in the bathroom. Aaron and Jeff drag Frank to the bathroom door.
Are you in there? Aaron opens the door and we see Uncle Russell still on the toilet. He looks up.
What's that? Aaron slams the door. We can hear Russell's muffled shouting coming from behind the bathroom door.
Norman!! Why is Uncle Russell on the toilet?
I forgot!
How could you forget?! What the hell is wrong with you?! Another loud bang on the door.
Aaron, open the door. Norman opens the door as Aaron runs over to keep Derek from entering.
What is it?
Aaron, where's Norman?
 I'm here.
It's Oscar, he went crazy. He's-- Derek realizes that something weird's going on.
What's going on?
Nothing. Derek puts aside his curiosity for the time being.
Look, Oscar's on the roof stark naked. He saw me kissing Elaine and now he's threatening to jump!
I've got to go. Jeff rushes to the door.
Where are you going?
I have to go out there. If he jumps, my sister is going to kill me. Jeff rushes out.
 Wait here. Aaron follows Jeff, but he does not run. He walks out.
Get back here. Be careful!
I believe I can fly! I believe I can touch the sky! ANGLE ON: Aaron who steps out and sees everybody watching Oscar.
Oscar, come inside. We'll have some coffee.
Oscar! She climbs out the window.
Aaron notices that everybody is captivated by the drama.
Elaine, what are you doing?! Elaine sees Oscar climbing further up the roof.
Elaine! Elaine follows Oscar. Aaron realizes this is his chance. He heads back inside. Michelle catches him at the door.
What are you doing?
I think I can get rid of this guy, but I need you to stay out here and try to stop anyone from coming in.
Okay. I'll do what I can. She heads back to the crowd on the lawn. As Aaron goes through the doorway of the kitchen, Derek passes him on the way out to the lawn to see what's happening.
Elaine!
Who is it?
It's Aaron! Norman opens the door.
Everyone's out in the garden... We've gotta move the body now.
Let's go! Ryan and Aaron grab Frank. As Norman runs out.
Quick. Quick! Aaron and Ryan carry Frank out as Norman looks around.
Make sure no one comes in. As they disappear around the corner,, Norman closes the study door. He turns just in time to find Reverend Davis approaching. He intercepts.
 Hi! The reverend looks around, not knowing why Norman is being so especially friendly to her.
So, what made you decide to get your God on?
Look, I'm sorry, I really need to use
I'd like to make a confession.
I'm not a priest.
That's okay, 'cause I'm not Catholic.
Aaron, we have to do this. Aaron looks up at Ryan and nods his assent. Ryan and Aaron lift up Frank and try their best to put him in the coffin.
What do you think God's favorite color is?
I'll bet it's blue. The sky's blue. The seas are blue. And the winds blew, too.
We can't leave it like that.
Ryan looks down and laughs.
In a strange way, this might have been what he wanted.
Be serious for a second. They begin lifting him again.
Why do you say I don't take anything seriously? You complain about me all the time, but if I didn't play the bad boy, you couldn't play the martyr.
Look, I must get to a phone. There's a man on the roof who's going to jump.
I'm addicted to strip clubs. The shoes, the poles, the smell. I just like to take my money and throw it in the air. I like to make it rain.
Oscar... Please don't do this... love you.
Then why were you with him?
I wasn't with him.
Yes, you were! I saw you!
I'll never be good enough. Not for your dad, and not for you.
Oscar, please just come inside.
No. You go inside.
Come with me.
Why?
Because you're going to be a father. Oscar looks at her, shocked.
What?
I'm pregnant. We're going to have a child... ANGLE ON: Oscar and Elaine.
You're pregnant? Oscar is overcome with emotion. Elaine holds out her hand.
I won't be able to do it without you. Very slowly, a naked Oscar, walks toward her and they embrace. The crowd applauds. ANGLE ON: Michelle.
What about me?! I want a baby. Would somebody get me pregnant?! Everybody looks at Michelle. She smiles weakly.
Bye, Dad. Ryan takes a long look as he closes the coffin.
Great. Duncan heads toward the kitchen door. He passes a shocked looking Derek. Michelle follows and speaks loudly as Duncan is about to enter the kitchen.
Aaron?! Oscar's off the roof!
I'm going to kill him. Jeff follows Duncan in, looks at the coffin, then looks at Aaron and Ryan questioning them with his eyes. They return the look with silent assurance that the job is done. Michelle comes in.
Yeah.
Thank God. Everybody breathes a sigh of relief.
Thank you.
Elaine! Elaine opens the bathroom door and Duncan enters. Elaine helps Oscar get dressed.
Look, Dad--
Elaine, stay out of this.
No, I'm not staying out of this. Remember how I told you we were moving in together? Well, I lied. We're getting married. Duncan is shocked.
You're what?!
We're getting married.
Elaine, you don't have to marry him just because you're pregnant.
I'm not marrying him because I'm pregnant. I'm marrying him because I love him.
How can you love him? He's an idiot.
Dad, this is my life. If you don't like it, too bad. But if you want to keep me and my child in your life, you'd better change your attitude, especially about my husband.
Elaine exits, taking Oscar with her.
Bye, Dad. They exit.
Baby, I really think we should start again now. Have you seen Uncle Russell? Aaron remembers where he is and looks at Ryan. They rush off to the study, passing Jeff. Jeff checks his pockets and realizes the pills are gone again. He goes off to find them.
What the hell is going on in this place?
I'm so sorry, Uncle Russell. There was someone on the roof--
Never mind that. What about that dead body you dragged in here? Aaron and Ryan feign ignorance.
What dead body?
Don't mess with me. I know a dead body when I see one. I live in a retirement home.
Derek walks over and joins Norman.
Did you hear that? She's having a kid! Derek looks at Norman who's looking sort of distant.
How's your skin thing?
Oh that... It's probably nothing. I'm more worried about Hepatitis C after having Uncle Russell's shit in my mouth. I think I'm feeling yellow. Norman touches his skin as he walks away, leaving Derek confused. ANGLE ON: Jeff frantically looking for the pill bottle. He gives up and sits in a chair. ANGLE ON: Ryan is wheeling Uncle Russell into the room as Aaron moves to his seat.
I'm telling you I saw the guy. He was dead!
I know you did, Russell. We all did.
No! In the bathroom. Ryan offers a look to the other mourners indicating that Uncle Russell's a bit mad and shouldn't be listened to. ANGLE ON: Michelle comes over to Aaron.
I can't believe what a nightmare today has been.
I don't know. It's been sort of exciting. Aaron looks at her.
For a funeral, I mean...
Listen, about the condo and the baby,
We'll work it out. Let's just get this day over with. Then we can worry about the rest of our lives. Aaron hugs Michelle.
I can't believe I still have to do this eulogy... with everything I've just found out. A beat.
It doesn't change anything, does it?
Not a thing. Reverend Davis approaches Aaron, looking at her watch and appearing flustered.
We're going to have to fly through this now. I already missed a funeral and two Christenings.
Sure. Let's go.
Do you want an open casket?
No! The reverend looks shocked at the reaction, but ignores it. She stands up at the front and speaks quickly.
Alright! Everybody in their seats now!  Hey, you, sit down. People settle into their seats. Ryan manages to squeeze in next to Martina. He smiles at her, flirtatiously. Cynthia throws Ryan a look, and he gets up and goes to sit with her.
 I'd like to apologize on behalf of the family for all of the distractions. I hope that everyone is settled and ready to continue with the service. Aaron, the oldest son, would like to say a few words about his father. Michelle gives Aaron an encouraging look as he makes his way to the front. Aaron clears his throat and prepares to begin. The room is absolutely silent. He takes a deep breath. ANGLE ON: The reverend nodding for Aaron to hurry up. ANGLE ON: Aaron.
My father... was an exceptional--
My father was an exceptional man.
Not only did he live for his family, but he was always there for others--
What the hell is going on?
There's someone in there!
I knew it! I knew it! Suddenly the coffin lid flips off and everyone stares in wonder as Frank sits up, looking like a crazy person, and babbling incoherently. Several people scream. Frank opens the other end of the coffin and looks at his dead lover.
 What the hell are you doing in my Dad's coffin? Frank starts grabbing at Edward's body screaming.
Edward! Edward! Edward! Ryan, Norman and Jeff try to pull Frank out of the coffin, but he's holding onto the corpse.
No! No! Finally they get Frank out and carry him from the room. As he passes Cynthia, the photos fall out of his pocket at her feet. As Duncan closes the coffin again, Cynthia bends down and picks up one of the photographs and stares at it. Her face turns to horror as she makes out the image. The noise in the room is broken by Cynthia's furious cry. She drops the photos and runs at Frank.
You bastard! Cynthia tackles Frank and starts beating him.
 He was with you! Duncan picks up the photos. He shows them to Uncle Russell.
I always thought he had a little sugar in his tank. Everything has descended into total chaos until Aaron finally shouts across the room.
He had his... shortcomings, but he took care of his family. He loved his family. He loved this house. He worked hard. All I wanted today was to show him how much we all loved and admired him. To give him the respect that he deserved... Is that really so much to ask? We all get so distracted by the... little things in life. We forget about the important things. Like the fact that we lost a great man. The mourners look up at Aaron with undivided attention.
So maybe he loved "Dreamgirls" more than most men. We don't know why a man makes the choices he makes. But I do know that my father made the best choices he could make. Life is complicated. We're just thrown here together in a world filled with chaos and confusion... and we do our best. And Dad did his best... Aaron looks over at the coffin. As.he speaks, we see shots of Cynthia, Frank, Jeff, Norman, Duncan as they are moved by Aaron's words.
He taught us to go for what we wanted in life, because you never know how long you're going to be here... And whether you succeed... or you fail... the important thing is that you tried.
A beat. Michelle looks up at her husband with pride. We see the various other mourners looking at Aaron and listening.
So when you all leave here today, I want you to remember Dad for who he really was... A decent, loving man who never condemned anyone for how they lived. Who never cast disparaging remarks or held prejudices against race, gender... height. If only we could all be as giving, as generous, as understanding as my father... Even dead, my father has more character than everyone in this room. If I am half the man my father was, my child will be incredibly blessed. Aaron turns and walks out of the room. Everyone watches him go. Michelle follows him out of the room.
How's Mom?
She's resting. A beat.
I've asked Mom to come live with me for awhile. It'll give you and Michelle a chance to breathe a bit, you know. Move and everything. Aaron looks at Ryan, surprised.
