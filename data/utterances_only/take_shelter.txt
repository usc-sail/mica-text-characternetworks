 No, no, no...Don't feed the dog darlin'. Hannah immediately picks the piece of toast back up and feeds it to the dog. Samantha brings the pan over and spoons eggs out on everyone's plates.
Thanks babe.
You slept late.
Yeah. I need to go. What you got going today?
I've got to finish up some curtains for Saturday, and Nat and Cam are coming over.
Yeah. Cammie said she just needed to get out of the house. Samantha takes her seat at the table.
Tell Nat to take it easy on her. Curtis gets up and goes to Hannah.
Cam can hold her own. We need to send in the deposit for the beach condo. He kneels beside his daughter's chair and waits for her to make eye contact. She looks over at him. He speaks using sign language. Three broad, slow gestures.
Just write the check, babe. Okay.
Okay. Bye. Samantha sips her coffee as Hannah feeds more toast to the dog.
 No more food. You, eat.
Yeah, let's keep going with that bit! It'll go another 10 feet! He yells to DEWART, a big guy sitting at the controls of a diesel powered WELL-DRILLING RIG. The truck has a long rusted bed with metal scaffolding raised HIGH on its back.
We won't get the gravel pack down today!
Why not?!
Those clouds! We're gonna have to call it! Curtis looks back to a potential STORM. Gray clouds forming across the horizon.
Happy hour starts at five Dewart!
Oh, yeah.
They were just drinkin' and laughin' and oh, my god...it was like I was bein' in a museum and I saw the progress from apes to men. I saw it. I saw the future. Dewart, that was him...that was going to be him in 20 years.
Oh my god. Cammie laughs.
Let me tell you, you laugh. You laugh. But this little one in your arms is gonna be shufflin' in a bar just like `em. Yep...
You guys okay?
Yeah. Samantha takes a wide line around Hannah, who continues banging the two-by-four into the ground. As soon as the child sees her mother, she stops. Samantha crouches in front of Hannah, gently taking the board away from her. Samantha signs with her hand and speaks at the same time.
No. Don't touch. Hannah tilts her head, looking off to the side. Samantha touches her chin bringing her eyes back around.
 You understand? Hannah nods once, "yes".
Oksy. Come here. Samantha stands and takes the board to a trash pile in the back corner of the yard. A STORM SHELTER is buried in the ground just behind the pile. It's a grass covered mound with two rusted metal doors angled toward the sky. She throws the board onto the heap and wipes her hands on her pants. Staring at the pile, she lets out an irritated sigh. Thunder rumbles low in the distance. She looks up at the approaching clouds and calls to the children as she walks back inside.
Hey, DJ. Bring the girls inside.
The drill bit spins as rain pelts the ground turning the dark soil into black mud.
Looking at the horizon, he sees no sign of the storm letting up. He looks to Dewart, who smiles at him from behind the controls of the rig.
What? It's not my fault! I told you!
Yeah. All right...All right! I'm callin' it! Shut it down! Dewart gladly eases back on the lever at his knee.
Bye guys. Thanks for coming over.
I'll call next week about the Lions Club supper.
Okay. Love you.
Bye Sam.
Bye Cam. Running for her car holding a jacket covered car seat. Samantha closes the door and listens to her quiet house. The rain outside is the only noise. She heads to the kitchen.
Can you sign s-t-o-r-m?
Storm. Hannah looks back out the window. They watch the storm together.
I gotta get home.
Nat and me been lookin' into a threesome. We've been chattin' with a girl online from Canton. Yeah. Big `ol girl.
What's big?
She's about two fifty, two seventy five. She can't be no taller than 5 foot. Dewart starts laughing, which makes Curtis laugh.
Shit man. The laughing subsides.
I don't see me and Sam gettin' into somethin' like that.
No. I don't guess you would. Dewart is staring at Curtis.
You got a good life Curtis.
I'm serious. I think that's the best compliment you can give a man, take a look at his life and say, that's good. That guy's doin' somethin' right.
Well. It ain't always so easy.
Hell I know that. Dewart sees something out his window.
Ah shit. I gotta go...Manana.
Good night. Nat, in a house robe and slippers, weaves her way through the maze of junk on their front lawn. Dewart passes her without saying a word. Curtis watches as she follows him inside the house, still talking. He shifts into drive and pulls away.
She do all right today?
She was fine. She's still not playin' with the others, though. She can't connect. Honey, you gotta clean up that trash pile in the back. She fished out a board that had nails on it.
I'll get to it this weekend. It's quiet for a moment.
I still take off my boots so I won't wake her up. She smiles up at her husband.
I still whisper. He pulls her tight. They stand together in the doorway. The house is silent.
Curtis flinches at the loud boom. He looks to the sky and sees dark clouds twisting overhead. Hannah plays, unaffected by the noise. To get a better view, Curtis moves from beneath a tree in the corner of the yard and surveys the large swath of farmland that runs up to his property. Chain-link fencing partitions the yard from a deep concrete culvert that leads out to the open field. A giant STORM CELL gathers force on the horizon there. Red barks incessantly. He winces and strains against the rope tied to his collar. Curtis flinches again as A BOLT OF LIGHTNING streaks to the ground in the distance. Sparks shoot into the air leaving a circle of scorched crops. Another CRACK of thunder.
Curtis?
What?
Did you hear me? You got to be home, showered, ready to walk out the door by six tonight. Curtis stands up and goes over to Hannah. He grabs her off the floor and she begins to protest with kicks and crying.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I just want her to eat her breakfast and stop playin' with the damn dog.
She's fine down there. She had toast already. Curtis, against flailing, manages to get Hannah in her chair. Curtis backs off, frustrated. Hannah climbs down from her chair and goes back to the floor and the dog.
Hannah. Come here. Hannah.
Curtis?
What? He stops and checks his watch.
I'm late.
You didn't eat anything? Heading out.
It's okay. Curtis is gone. Samantha looks at Hannah on the floor with the dog.
I didn't say you had control over the weather Russell, what I did say was that the top shelf has to be cleared by the 15th. That's non- negotiable. Dewart eats from a bag of Sunflower seeds. Curtis stares down at his forearm. He rubs the skin there. Jim runs a finger down his clipboard.
Umm, Curtis. Where we at on that east 82nd site? Curtis snaps his head up, takes a second.
Yesterday slowed us down. We couldn't get the second pilot hole drilled. Jim drops his head and the clipboard falls to his side. A melodramatic move.
It rained for two hours yesterday. Two hours and our entire schedule went in the toilet. We lose the permit if you're not out of there by end of day.
Yes sir.
End of day Curtis. Curtis nods.
All right. Valerie tells me that the father son pancake cook off...
Hey, I gotta make a stop before we head out there.
Think we got time?
Yeah. There's time.
Curtis stands over the hole being drilled. The turning metal pole suddenly seizes up and stops. Smoke begins to seep up from the hole.
Sonofabitch. Dewart jumps down from the control panel to take a look.
We stripped that bit.
Yeah. Well, bring it up. We gotta re-set it. Dewart walks back to his controls. Curtis heads to the cab of the drilling rig and checks his watch.
Shit. Something catches his eye in the distance. Clearing past the rig, he walks out into the adjacent field. He removes his goggles, eyes fixed on the acres of farmland that stretch for miles in front of him. In the sky overhead,
Curtis watches, mesmerized. Dewart strains a wrench against a bolt as the drill screeches in reverse.
Curtis! Curtis acknowledges Dewart but can't take his eyes off the pattern of birds. They shrink and stretch from thick clumps to long cylindrical tubes. A choreography. Curtis reluctantly heads back to the rig, which is shrieking with the SOUND of metal on metal.
You ever see birds fly like that?!
(holding his hand to his
What?! Curtis looks back, giving the birds a final review.
Curtis climbs out and walks to the driveway.
Come on we gotta go.
Ah, Jesus. I could really use a shower.
So if you continue with the basic vocabulary, this will allow you to communicate with your children better. Curtis sits, filthy, at a school desk he doesn't quite fit into. A TEACHER speaks to a ROOM FULL of PARENTS.
Between the ages of four and seven the focus is more on the sign and then later we'll begin adding the alphabet as more of a support syster. Now in ASL... Curtis looks over at Samantha, who is sitting in the desk next to him. She won't look at him. He cranes his neck around to see toward the back of the room. An ASSISTANT TEACHER sits on a large, colorful rug with a GROUP of CHILDREN, all different ages, playing games that teach hand signs. Hannah actively participates in the group.
...the male sign is signed at the forehead area. For example, father is signed up here like this...Father, very good. Curtis turns back in his chair and makes the sign for "dad" along with the other parents.
You're not sorry.
I am sorry. She looks to Hannah and signs, "swim".
Well, you stink. You smell really bad. He smiles.
I think I smell good. She smiles, begrudgingly, and then signs to Hannah, "Dad" and "stink". Curtis turns to some ladies behind him.
Do I smell good? Samantha laughs and tries to cover his mouth with her hand.
See. Maybe I should marry her instead. They continue to laugh.
Stop.
 You okay? She nods. He cranks the truck and turns on the wipers. The liquid on the windshield streaks into long smudges. Curtis leans forward to get a better view of the street. He checks his blind spot and pulls away.
Curtis stomps on the brakes and turns the wheel. The truck hydroplanes. CRASH! Curtis' head busts against the steering column. The front windshield cracks as the truck jerks to a stop. The HISS of a broken radiator. Curtis winces from the blow to his head. Hannah is crying. He reaches over to her.
Are you okay? Hannah physically looks all right, but she continues crying. Curtis reaches out and places a hand on her head. He's dazed, mumbling.
You're okay. The truck is angled up slightly like the front end has inched up a pole. A cut on his forehead has begun to bleed. He sees movement. A PERSON passes by the hazy side window. A SHAPE moves past the driver's window. The truck shifts as weight is added to the bed. The SOUND of SOMEONE pulling things from the back of the truck. A moment. WHACK! Curtis flinches as a 2X4 pounds the windshield. The truck jostles from the weight of someone jumping on the hood. Bump. Bump. The roof caves in with two FOOTSTEPS. Curtis looks around frantically. He reaches over to Hannah and begins to unstrap her from the car seat.
A HAND yanks Curtis by his collar. He's pulled against the door. A pasty forearm wraps around his neck, choking him. He strains against the arm. Sucks air. Needing to breath. The Woman at the passenger door grabs for Hannah. Curtis kicks at her. A MAN's boot KICKS OUT the back window. The Man in the bed of the truck reaches for Curtis' face. He flails and kicks, unable to break free from the forearm at his door. The Woman gets hold of Hannah. The child is yanked from Curtis' arms. He screams.
Hannah! Hannah! Hands claw at Curtis' face. Scratching. Blood streaks. The Woman has disappeared into the storm with Hannah. Curtis screams. Fingers swoop into his open mouth, grabbing hold of his cheek. They pull the cheek back. TEARING. He yells in pain.
Here honey. Put on your shoes
Good, you're up. Curtis doesn't turn to greet her. He just stirs a spoon in the black coffee. Samantha walks up to him and puts a hand on his back. She notices that his shirt is soaked with sweat.
Honey, you're soaked. He turns, taking a sip from the mug. She feels his forehead.
Are you sick?
I've felt better.
I guess we could stay home if we need to.
Where you goin'?
It's Saturday, I was going to take Hannah to my booth.
Oh. Yeah. Curtis walks to the table and takes a seat.
You look really sick honey.
I'm all right. It's just a cold or somethin'.
Let me get you some Advil. She heads for the hallway.
No. Don't worry about it. Ya'll just go. I'll be fine.
You sure?
Yeah.  Better already. Samantha walks to her purse on the counter and roots through to find a set of keys.
Okay. I got my phone if you need anything. Don't forget Sunday lunch is here tomorrow. This reminder makes Curtis rub his face with a grunt.
If you're sick, we should cancel.
I'll be all right.
Okay, we'll talk later. She heads for the door with Hannah.
Come on. Let's go.
Honey, please.
Okay. Samantha scoops up her bag and takes Hannah by the hand. They leave the room. Curtis notices the dog, Red, sitting on his haunches looking at him. Curtis stares back, sipping his coffee.
-The prefab DOGHOUSE is set down in the back corner. Curtis stands in front of his newly created dog pen. It's waist high and about 7' X 10', tucked in the back left corner of the yard so that half of the pen is made up by the existing fencing.
You can tell by the look of her that she's a flea market pro, a BARGAIN HUNTER.
How much you asking for this pillow?
This pillow's fifteen dollars.
That's more than I want to spend.
This is all hand stitched. It takes a really long time. That's why I charge that.
I'll give you seven for it. Samantha looks at the woman, who is almost daring her.
I can't go that low.
Well that's my offer. The woman sets down the pillow and begins looking over other items on the table. Samantha bites the inside of her cheek. She doesn't like to haggle.
How about 10? The woman doesn't look up.
I'll give you eight, but it's in change. Samantha forces a smile and motions to Hannah.
That's fine. The woman smiles and removes a Ziplock bag of assorted coins from her purse. Hannah takes the bag.
Lucky for you she likes to count change. Hannah opens the bag and begins to turn it over.
Red! Come on.
Get in. Red walks into the pen.
Good boy. Curtis closes the gate, kneels and places his hands on the fence. Red approaches so that his nose is touching Curtis' fingers. Curtis scratches him.
I'm sorry about this buddy. We just gotta work it like this for awhile okay? Curtis stands, wiping his hands off on his jeans. He sees the Storm Shelter poking up from behind the trash pile. He looks down at Red. Curtis walks to the Shelter. Clearing past the trash pile, the shelter appears, the mound fully visible. Curtis stops at the angled doors. He studies them. A rusted padlock is snapped shut across the handles. He reaches out and lifts up the padlock. He yanks on it, then lets it fall.
But that's what I don't understand. If he didn't do anything why did you put him out back? Samantha counts out the money earned at the flea market. She sets a portion aside and closes the tackle box. Curtis says something, but it's inaudible.
What? She opens the tin and removes an envelope with the word "BEACH" written on it in black sharpie. Samantha adds the money to the envelope and puts up the jar. She opens the fridge and takes out the milk.
You hear me? I said if he didn't do anything why did you have to put him outside? Curtis' attention is on the TV. Samantha sits on the couch.
I just wanted him to be outside for awhile.
He's your dog. He's always been an inside dog.
He's my dog, and that's why he's outside. Right now with Hannah and everything I just think it'd be better.
Hannah loves Red.
Hold on. Curtis stares at the television program. Samantha's eyes narrow. Frustrated, she flips open her magazine.
...the gas cloud spread across their six acre property.
The only way off their land was across the train tracks which were blocked by wreckage.
 I tried using some wet rags and towels to breathe through but that just seemed to make it worse.
While rescue workers made several attempts to reach the family, Walter Jacobs' wife and brother-in- law died in the home. Jacobs survived despite enduring eleven hours of exposure to the gas cloud before finally being flown out by helicopter.
You hearin' this? Her nose still in the magazine.
It's awful.
Eleven hours. No way out. Samantha shakes her head. Curtis watches the footage of Walter Jacobs. He watches his red rimmed eyes. The deep lines in his face.
Hannah. Hannah doesn't move. She continues staring out the window. The SOUND of the storm outside intensifies. Windows begin to rattle in their frames. Curtis walks over and reaches for Hannah but is startled by the sight of a MAN'S FACE just outside the window. Hannah and the Man have been staring at one another. The Man, hollow eyed and pale, moves out of the window and out of sight.
Hey! Thunder CRACKS overhead. Curtis scoops Hannah into his arms and heads out of the room. BANG. The front door rattles. Curtis stops and turns back. BANG. BANG. The SOUND of someone kicking at the front door. The storm outside has grown to a deafening pitch. The power goes out. The entire house vibrates, like a freight train running across the roof. The BANGING at the front door continues, frame giving way, as the STORM reaches its apex. Curtis, holding Hannah, kneels and braces himself in the entryway to the den. He covers the back of Hannah's head with his hands and squeezes her tight into his shoulder. Then Silence. A stillness. The rain stops. No more banging at the front door. The SUN moves brightly though the front windows.
The furniture in the den lifts off the ground. A couch, Lazyboy, coffee table and lamp. It all hangs in the air, floating for a moment. Quietly. Curtis watches, eyes wide. A rumbling. Grows. The SUNLIGHT vanishes. SMASH! The sound of the storm is sucked back into the room as the furniture crashes to the floor, breaking apart on impact.
Babe?
Yeah?
You got the number for Dr. Shannan? She turns.
You're still not feeling good?
Yeah, but you got the number?
Uh, yeah baby but he'll be closed today. She approaches the bed and he holds his hand out.
Right. Yeah. I'll call tomorrow.
Honey if you're not feeling good we take you in somewhere. She walks closer to the bed.
No. Stop! She's taken aback.
Okay. Do you want me to cancel lunch today...
Shit...
What is that?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just I got a sore throat. I'm sorry I'm taking it out on you.
I was gonna leave Hannah with you so I could go to church, but I'm not going to with you like this.
It's fine. I'll be fine.
No. She needs breakfast.
I'm sorry that you feel bad but you need to drop the attitude.
Come on. Just go.
What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just go.
Hannah's in the den. We have cereal for her. Samantha stomps out of the room. Curtis sighs. He halfway lifts the sheet then lets it fall again.
We're going out. Confused, she slices her finger down an open palm.
 We're going out. Okay? It's okay.
You stay put okay? Hannah begins looking through the book. Curtis stands, he sees a set of computers under a sign reading, "CATALOGUE".
Let's just start.
Let's all join hands for the blessing. The SOUND of the front door opening. Samantha gets up and leaves the room.
Where the hell have you been?
I know. I'm sorry. I had to run an errand.
You're really late.
I know.
You didn't even bring your cell phone. Samantha heads back to the dining room. Curtis sucks his teeth.
Missed you at church this mornin' Curtis.
Dad.
He knows what to do if he wants me to stop askin'. Curtis looks at him.
Was it a good service?
It was. It was good work. Curtis nods. The family in front of him eats the meal.
I'm thinking about cleaning up that storm shelter out back. They look at him.
Curtis? Curtis stands and follows the nurse out of the room.
Curtis, how you doin' bud?
Hey Doc.
How's my girl?
She's good.
That's good to hear. Tilt your head back for me. The Doctor shines the otoscope into his nostrils.
I don't have a cold. The Doctor pauses and turns to check a chart on the table.
Oh. Did she get that down wrong?
No, I just told her that.
Oh. So what's the problem?
I've been havin'...I've been having some trouble sleepin'. I was hopin' you could give me somethin' for it. Doctor Shannan takes a seat on a rolling stool and processes the request.
How long's this been goin' on?
`Bout four nights now.
You're not sleepin' at all?
Well some, but real restless.
Well, I think four nights is a little too soon to tell. My advice would be to not eat or drink anything after 8 o'clock at night. Cut back on any alcoholic drinks, tobacco, caffeine...get some daily exercise.
Well, I think... Curtis isn't sure how much he wants to say.
I think I may need to try some medication.
Why do you say that?
You urinated in your bed?
Yeah. Couple days before that I had a dream that my dog attacked me and it took all day for the pain in my arm to go away. Doctor Shannan leans his back against the table and thinks about this.
You been to see your mother lately? He swivels the stool around and writes on a prescription pad.
It's been about a month. He tears two sheets off and holds the first out to Curtis.
Okay. This is a prescription for a pretty mild sedative. It's non- habit forming, but I'm only giving you enough for a few days anyway. Take it and see if it helps. In the meantime,  This is the number of a good friend of mine in Columbus. He's a psychiatrist. It's a drive, but he's the best I know.
Okay.
I'll give him a call and let him know you'll be down to see him.
All right.
Hey Dewart!
Not much. Curtis kneels at the ground beside the rig. Sifts dirt through his fingers.
They want us to get a pilot hole drilled by lunch. I figure worse comes to worse we can eat on the rig.
Yeah, we'll get it done. Weekend all right?
Yeah. Same old shit.
No. I need the name of the specialist whose diagnosis you'll accept.
 No. Look it. I've told you this twice. Please. Just get me the name and or the approval code.
 All right. And the phone. Well great. Thank you very much. The Agent hangs up the phone and rips a piece of paper from the pad in front of her. She hands it to Samantha.
This is the name and number of the specialist who the insurance company approves of. Just call and make an appointment. Now if this doctor signs off , you should have the implant procedure fully covered. I'm sorry it took so long. Samantha looks at the paper, impressed.
Can I give you a hug?
It's fine. It's fine. You know your husband's company actually has very good insurance when it kicks in. Not a lot of jobs offer policies half as good. You're very lucky.
The Pharmacist returns with a stapled white bag. Curtis holds out the insurance card.
That's okay. We have your insurance on file. That'll be
What's the co-pay?
That is your co-pay. Curtis studies the small paper sack and removes three, 20 dollar bills from his wallet.
Hey. She squeezes him. Then kisses him.
I love you.
I love you too.
I have good news.
Green? How `bout a red? She pretends to use the crayon as lipstick.
It was like talking to a sane person for once. She made one phone call. That's it. I've been trying that 800 number for weeks.
It's great. It's great.
You excited? Huh? We're gonna get you some help. Curtis touches his finger to her chest then stops. He can't think of the sign. He turns to Samantha.
How do you say...sign excited?
Like this. Samantha shows him the sign. Curtis mimics.
Excited. Yeah? Hannah nods. He kisses her on the forehead. He picks up a crayon and holds it up to her lips like lipstick.
Now I got to do you.
Oh, honey. Look at this one. It's a 2-1 and it sits directly on the beach. Wouldn't that be great? We wouldn't have to worry about Hannah crossing traffic. Curtis walks over and leans in to see the page. They are rental photos of beach condos.
What's the rent?
Eight ninety nine a week.
That sounds real nice. Samantha keeps flipping through the magazine as Curtis heads to the bathroom.
You sleep well?
Yeah. I did.
You look like you're feeling better. Curtis nods and eats his breakfast.
You want me to come there and do it for you? Jesus. Curtis steadies the large metal piece as Dewart ratchets it down.
Hey, how much food do you think you'd need to live on for a week?
What do you mean?
I mean to stay alive. What do you think you'd need?
Not a lot.
You think?
I don't know. You hear about people livin' for days all the time offa bark and melted snow.
I've never heard of that.
Shit I don't know. You asked the question.
It's on there. It's on. Come on.
Dammit.
What? Curtis turns around and checks the sky. It's clear blue. Not a cloud in sight.
It sounds like thunder.
What sounds like thunder?
Where you goin'? Curtis. Where you goin'?
Curtis looks out his passenger window. His truck has stopped in front of a Tractor Trailer Depot. A rusted shipping container with giant white letters painted on it reads, "CONTAINERS FOR SALE". Curtis stares at this. He climbs out of the truck.
Curtis.
Hey Mom. Her eyes light up and she wraps her arms around Curtis.
Come in.
Sure. She leads him inside.
I'm going to get some water. He fills his glass at the sink. Takes a sip.
You want some?
No.
Isn't she lovely. Curtis drops his head. He looks uncomfortable.
Mom?
Yes.
I need to ask you somethin'. She looks at him. Totally open.
Do you remember what year we brought you up here? To the first place. She has to think about it.
It was `86.
Yes. Because Kyle was going to be a senior.
I was 10.
Yes. Curtis nods.
Can you remember what happened before you got diagnosed?
What do you mean?
I mean...I just want to know how it all started. Before you had to leave. Sarah settles in her chair, understanding the question.
Oh, I don't know. I remember it was a real stressful time. Your father was gone a lot, and I couldn't handle things on my own.
Did you ever have any dreams? Like bad dreams.
No. Nothing like that. There was always...
 There was always a panic that took hold of me. I thought people were watching me or listening to me.
Sarah is remembering. Her face draws tight, frustrated.
It's all right. It's all right. It's fine. Sarah looks up and smiles. Her focus shifts back to her son.
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. Sarah looks back down to Hannah's photo.
 May I have the number for Doctor George Shannan?
 Hi, is Doctor Shannan there? May I speak with him? This is Curtis LaForche.
Hey.
Oh, hey. Sorry I woke you up.
It's okay. Where you been?
I went to see mom. Samantha sits up in the bed.
Is she okay?
Mmm hmm. I just wanted to check up on her.
You shoulda told me we would have gone with you.
That's okay. Samantha lays back down, tucking herself under the covers.
Come to bed.
I will in a bit. Curtis finishes emptying his pockets.
-Plumbing and waste, $1,650 -Bobcat, $1,750 -Jackhammer with pneumatics, $800 -Sealant, $150 -Dirt, -$250 At the bottom of the list, Curtis writes the figure, "$7,500" and circles it. He studies the number, then begins drawing a rectangular diagram below it.
Well you've kept up with the payments on the house.
We've been good about that. Myers nods, but he carries a look of concern. He confides.
I gotta tell you Curtis, banks aren't loaning money the way they used to. We've got you a loan today, but the interest rates are variable and we have to tie it to your house.
That's fine. Myers sits back, drawing the pen to his lips and tapping it.
Curtis, I've known you a long time. We financed your house for you, two vehicles. I'm telling you this is a risky loan you're taking.
I need the money John. Myers nods, then leans forward and clicks the pen.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry I left you yesterday.
Jim came by. I covered for you.
Thanks.
I need your help with the depth charts.
Sure.
Fuckin' Nat put me in charge of frying oysters for that Lions Club supper.
You need another burner?
Yeah, if you still got yours I could use it.
You think you could help me with somethin'?
Whatta you need?
I'm gonna build out the tornado shelter in my backyard. I could use some help.
The hell you wanna do that for?
Just needs to be done. Dewart eyes him, unsure.
What do you need?
I figure I'll do it on Saturday, borrow some equipment from work.
You sure about that?
I just need a backhoe, a hauler. I'll rent the rest. Dewart stares off into the distance. He notices Curtis looking at him, waiting for an answer.
Yeah. Whatever. I'll help.
Thanks.
You all right man?
What do you mean?
I just don't wanna see you fuck up.
I'm not.
Come in.
Hi.
Hello. She half stands and offers a hand.
Have a seat. I'm Kendra.
Curtis. Curtis shakes and they sit. Kendra opens a manila folder.
I'm gonna start by askin' you some questions.
Okay. I already answered all the questions on the forms.
Yeah, I know. I looked at `em, but I need to get a profile started on you.
Right. Well... Curtis slides the yellow legal pad out of the book he brought. It's the library book on Mental Illness.
Out of the five possible symptoms needed to be diagnosed with
 delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, and the negative symptoms, I've had two. Delusions and hallucinations. But they say it has to continue for six months to be diagnosed schizophrenia and mine hasn't been goin' on anywhere near that long. So, I took this quiz in the back of the book and I scored a five out of a possible twenty. Schizophrenia starts at twelve. So, they say it might be a...  brief psychotic disorder. Whatever it is, I need to know what to do or what to get on to get this thing under control. Kendra stares at him.
Look. I'm a counselor. Certified, but I'm not a psychiatrist. I can't prescribe anything to you. I can talk to you, I can recommend where to send you, but that's it. Curtis begins to gather his things.
Now that said, if you want to talk, I'll listen. For a lot of people that's a good start. Curtis hesitates.
Now you said here that your mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in her thirties. And you're at 35. You wanna talk about that? Curtis settles in his seat. Sets his book on the floor.
Yeah, I don't know my mother's symptoms. I was just 10. My brother was 17. And, uh...I don't know. She just left me in the car in the parking lot at the grocery store one day. And she didn't come back. And then they found her a week later eatin' trash out of a dumpster in northern Kentucky.
My dad had to put her in the state hospital in Columbus. And she's been in assisted living ever since. Yep. My dad raised me. He died last April. Kendra nods, a pleasant look on her face.
So tell me `bout these dreams. Curtis studies her face, bites at the inside of his cheek.
I don't know what our schedule will be, but...
That's all right. But I really do think you should continue with the sign language. And any additional therapies that kids need for the cochlear implant.
Absolutely.
Okay. Good night.
Good night. As Samantha talks to the Teacher, Curtis looks over flashcards with Hannah. He signs "SUNSHINE", a circle in the sky with the hand then coming down, fingers spread.
Curtis sees the traffic continuing to pass by at full speed.
-Curtis, work goggles on, stands in a head deep hole holding a pneumatic jack hammer up to the exposed exterior wall of the storm shelter. He begins hammering.
Hey. It's all right. Calm down. Samantha takes Hannah into the house without saying a word.
Samantha.
Are you out of your mind? She continues into the house. Curtis turns, frustrated. Dewart takes this in, then goes back to his nails.
Not a word. You didn't say one word about this to me. Don't you think you owe me that? Don't you think that you might respect me enough to at least consider what I had to say?
I didn't want you worryin' about it.
Well I'm worried Curtis. How are you paying for all that?
I got a home improvement loan from the bank. Samantha is stunned. She stands and gets in his face.
How could you do that without talking to me? You know the expenses we have comin' up. You want to waste money on a stupid tornado shelter?
I'm doin' it...I'm doin' it for us. I know you don't understand.
You're right. I don't understand. I don't understand half the stuff you've been doin' lately. I don't understand you puttin' Red out back. I don't understand you stayin' up all night in that stupid tornado shelter. You don't come to bed half the time. You leave and don't tell me where you're goin'. Explain that to me. Please. Tell me something that helps me understand why you're bein' like this.
There's nothin' to explain. Samantha stares at his face, searching for an answer. She's on the verge of tears.
I'm gonna go put Hannah to bed. Curtis walks out of the room. Samantha can't hold back, tears run down her face.
Curtis! She touches his arms. A small amount of BLOOD begins to trickle from both sides of his mouth.
Baby. Oh, my God. Baby...Oh, my God. Baby. Samantha jumps off the bed and grabs a cordless phone on the dresser. She dials, watching her husband continue to shake.
I need an ambulance! My husband's having a seizure. 41800 Tindale Road. Hurry up. He's bleeding! Samantha goes over to him. Holding her hands out, cautious to touch him.
 Okay. Okay. Samantha puts the phone receiver down on the nightstand. The Operator's VOICE still coming through. She touches his arm. Suddenly, the seizures stop. Curtis' body is still. Samantha freezes. His eyes open and he thrashes up in bed. Samantha jumps, tripping and stumbling backward. Curtis sucks short breaths into his lungs. His head darts back and forth, eyes wild. He sees Samantha staring up at him from the floor. He begins to calm down. Curtis touches his mouth. Sees the blood there.
Honey? Samantha stands up and goes over to him. She sits on the edge of the bed and touches his arm. She's scared.
Honey? Are you okay? Curtis slowly nods.
You were having a seizure. I called an ambulance. Curtis sees the phone on the nightstand and grabs it.
 No. It's fine. It's fine. Don't send an ambulance. It's fine. Curtis clicks off the phone.
What are you doing? Curtis wraps his arms around her. He holds her tight. The SOUND of ambulance sirens approach from the distance. Samantha speaks, her voice trembling.
Baby what's goin' on?
I'm sorry you fellows had to come all the way out.
It's what we do. Now we can still take you in if you want a doctor to look at those cuts in your mouth.
Yeah. That's all right.. I'll see somebody on Monday.
All right.
Thanks. Curtis shakes their hands. He turns to walk back in the house and notices NEIGHBORS watching from their porches.
I haven't been honest with you. I'm sorry.
What's goin' on?
I've been havin' these dreams. I guess they're more like nightmares. It's why I've been actin' like this. Samantha listens with a furrowed brow.
They always start with a kind of storm. Like a real powerful storm.
And there's always this dark, thick rain. Like fresh motor oil. And then the things, people, it just makes `em crazy. They attack me. Sometimes they go after Hannah. First one I had Red nearly chewed through my arm.
That's why you put him out back?
Yeah.
What was the dream? Tonight.
It was Dewart. We were at the job site. The storm started and somethin' happened. His face. His eyes were different. He came after me with a pick ax. And we fought. And he ran it through my leg. Curtis zones out for a moment. Samantha says nothing.
It's hard to explain, because it's not just a dream. It's a feeling. I'm afraid something might be comin'. Something that's...not right. I can not describe it. I just need you to believe me. Samantha's eyes are red. Her nose. She nods slightly and dabs the tissue at the corner of her eye.
I've been to a counselor. I've seen her a few times. This makes Samantha look up.
You know what I come from. And I promised myself...I promised myself I would never leave. And I am doin' everything that I can to make that true. The room is quiet. Samantha watches her husband.
Since the doctor's approved her for surgery, We just need to get her scheduled. The next possible opening is...  The 21st of next month. That's six weeks.
Six weeks?
Is that okay?
It's wonderful.
...this point just to the west. I don't think we'll have any problem. We should be able to get twenty, maybe thirty in this next week. But we're looking to see how that's gonna shape up, so... Dewart smiles and makes broad gestures with his arms. He's telling a story to Dave, who laughs hard.
Curtis? His attention snaps back.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Yeah. That sounds good. We'll get it done. Russell rolls up the charts. They walk toward the work site, toward Dewart.
Come in. Curtis walks inside. He stands in front of the desk.
What you need Curtis?
I need a favor Jim.
What's that?
Can you take Dewart off my crew? Just reassign him someplace else. Jim sets his pen down and leans back.
What's the trouble? He not pullin' his weight?
No, nothin' like that. He's a good worker. He's a good man. He's my friend. I think it'd be easier not being in charge of someone I'm so close to. Jim nods.
You know, I understand. This is part of what it means to manage people Curtis. You're gonna have to learn that.
Yes sir. I appreciate that but... well it would just be very helpful in this case.
Okay. Well, I can put him with Russell. Anybody else you prefer?
No. Whoever you think's right.
Okay.
Thank you. Curtis turns to leave the office.
You been missin' a lotta work Curtis.
I know. My daughter's had a lot of doctor's visits. I haven't let anything get behind.
No. But don't. Okay.
Yessir. Curtis shows himself out.
I know they just usually do oysters and fries but what if we did something healthier on the side?
What like slaw? Nat gets up to refill her drink. She looks out the back door and surveys the construction zone. A FORKLIFT lowers the Shipping Container into the giant hole in the backyard. Nat shakes her head.
I don't know. Maybe a vegetable or salad.
Dewart's been tellin' me how strange Curtis has been actin' lately. I am so sorry. Nat brings her drink back to the table and sits. Samantha doesn't look up from her pad.
It's not like you don't have enough on your plate with Hannah. Nat puts her hand on Samantha's. Samantha moves it.
Things are fine. We're fine. Nat smiles sympathetically.
Can I help you?
Yeah. Can I look at one of these gas masks?
Sure. Which one you want to look at?
The newest one. The OWNER of the store removes a mask and hands it to him. Curtis fiddles with the mask.
How much?
One seventy eight. Curtis frowns at the price.
Anything cheaper?
No. That's the cheapest one I got in the store. They go all the way up to two ninety. I don't know what you want to spend but a gas mask ain't something you want to go cheap on.
You got any kids sizes?
No. Kids can't wear those. They got a have a special thing, its like a hood. I don't fool with those. Curtis nods. The perusing Shopper listens in.
Yeah. Ring me up a couple of `em.
What the hell are you doin'? Curtis smiles to himself. He turns to find KYLE standing at the edge of the hole. His hands are tucked into the back of his jeans and he's sizing up the work. Curtis steps off the roof of the shipping container onto ground level. He holds out a hand and Kyle shakes it, never taking his eyes off the unfinished shelter.
What you got goin' on here?
Just addin' on to the storm shelter.
Why?
Just `cause. Kyle notices the PVC piping running in the trenches.
You runnin' water to it?
Oh, yeah. From our well. Runnin' sewer out to the city line.
How much you spendin' on this thing?
It's not bad.
Doesn't look it. Curtis shrugs. Kyle sees his reluctance.
You take your eye off the ball one minute in this economy and you're screwed. You got the cash for this?
Yeah.
Don't put nothin' on credit cards. That shit'll eat you up.
I'm not. Kyle is staring him down. Curtis just looks at the shelter. There's a long silence shared between them.
Samantha called me.
I figured. Curtis climbs back onto the shipping container and continues installing the roof vent.
Called you to come tell me to quit?
She called `cause she's worried. Says you've been stressed out. Curtis doesn't answer.
So?
So what?
You stressed out?
No. No more than anybody else.
Work all right?
Uh, huh...Hey, look. You wanna come by and have dinner sometime, Kyle. That's fine. We'll have a beer and talk about the old days, but you got somethin' to say just say it.
You can stop that shit right now. I'll come over there and remind you what it feels like to get your ass whipped. Curtis keeps his head down, scolded. Kyle relents.
I'm just coming here to check on you.
Well I appreciate it Kyle.
You been to see Mom?
Yeah. A few days ago.
She all right.
You should see her. Take your girls.
Yeah. I'll get around to it. There's an awkward moment as Curtis works with his back to Kyle.
You need a hand? Curtis turns and looks up at him. Shakes his head.
No. I've got it. Kyle nods.
Okay. Call me if you need me okay?
I will. Kyle looks at him for a moment. He turns and walks toward the driveway.
Hey Kyle? Kyle turns back. Curtis climbs onto the yard and walks over to him.
Actually you could do me a favor.
What's that?
You still looking for a dog?
Sure. Kyle looks at him.
They got a good spot for you, okay bud. Kyle stands at the passenger door to the truck.
You sure?
Yeah.
I know it'll make my girls happy. All right. Kyle walks around the truck to the driver's side.
Hey Kyle?
Yeah? Kyle stops. Curtis walks up and hugs him. Kyle slaps him on the back.
Take care of yourself.
All right. All right. I will little brother. You take care of your family. Handle your business. Okay? Curtis nods. Kyle smiles, shaking his head.
All right. Kyle climbs into the truck and cranks it. Curtis steps back as he pulls away. Red looks back from the bed of the truck.
All right. Bedtime. Hannah looks up at him. Curtis signs his hand like a pillow then touches his watch. They move out of the bathroom.
You okay? She touches his hand. Curtis FLINCHES. Their eyes meet. He wants to take it back, and she can see that. It begins to sink in for her. Hannah vocalizes something behind them. Samantha looks at her husband, shakes her head in disbelief. Hannah makes another sound, pounds on the back door. Samantha turns and sees a MAN standing in their backyard. She flinches.
Who's that? Curtis stands to see out the back door.
Ah shit.
Hey Jim.
Curtis. Dewart told me you took equipment from work for a project at your house. Said that's why you wanted him off your crew. I came out here to see it myself.
Yeah. It was just a hauler and a backhoe. It was Saturday. I had `em back in less than 8 hours.
You know that doesn't matter. I can't even tell you how many rules you broke.
What if you had an accident? Huh? What if you ran somebody over on your way out here? Lawsuit like that could bankrupt me.
Well, I'm sorry Jim. I hadn't thought of that. Thank God nothin' like that happened. You know? I'll do whatever I can to make it right.
You can pick up your last check on Friday. You've got two weeks benefits. Curtis nods. Accepts it.
Did you fire Dewart?
He's on two weeks leave unpaid... I'm sorry Curtis. You did this to yourself. Jim turns and walks out of the backyard.
I've been fired. Samantha continues clearing the dishes to the sink. She doesn't look up.
What about the health insurance?
We get two more weeks. Samantha slams the plates into the sink. They break. She holds her head back and stares at the ceiling. She walks over to Curtis...
I'm sorry... ...and SLAPS him across the face. Hannah begins to cry.
Oh, `scuse me. Andy rises from his chair.
Are you Curtis?
Yeah.
Come in. Kendra transferred out. I'll be meeting with you today. Curtis looks at the man. He's kind of mincing.
Please, sit down. Curtis takes a seat.
What happened to Kendra?
She got into a program at OSU so she'll be transferring near there. I've split her case load with another counselor. It's been kind of crazy around here lately.
Huh.
So I've looked over your file. It says your mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in her early thirties. Let's start there.
I'm so sorry. I completely forgot.
That's okay. Don't worry about it.
Here. I hope you like them. Samantha hands over the plastic bag.
Thanks. I brought cash.
That's terrific. It's fine.
Call me if they don't work and I'm sorry again.
Oh, it's okay. Thank you. Samantha closes the door.
The shipping container has been covered over with dirt. Two rotating vents spin at either end of the brown mound. Curtis sits on the freshly packed dirt signing with Hannah. He signs something that makes her laugh. Hannah smacks a muddy clump between her hands. Curtis touches her nose, leaving a dirt smudge. Hannah laughs. She touches his face, smudging it.
What's that?
That's the alternator from the truck.
I was just trying to figure out a way to charge enough batteries to run lights down there. Ah, what the hell? Maybe I'll hook it up to your old exercycle. Samantha almost smiles. Curtis keeps his eyes on the parts.
You gonna leave me? Samantha looks at his hands. They hang by his sides.
You flinched when I touched your hand this morning.
I'm sorry.
I was in one of your dreams? Curtis nods.
Yeah.
Can you deal with that? He holds open his hand to her. She takes it.
Yeah.
Okay. Then I made a decision. We cancel the beach trip. We have enough to cover bills for the next two months with your last check. I'm going to get a job. You're gonna find another job. I'm going to call to see if we can move Hannah's surgery up. We'll need to see what it costs to extend your policy to the end of the year. I want you to see a psychiatrist. Not a counselor from the free clinic. Someone good.
Doctor Shannan gave me the number of somebody. But, uh, I just don't think we can afford it.
We'll find the money. Also, the Lions Club supper's this weekend. I want you to come with me.
I don't want to see any of those people.
I want you to go. I need to do something normal.
All right. Curtis nods. Samantha let's go of his hand and walks back to the house. Curtis goes back to studying the auto parts.
How many pieces does Hannah get?
Just one. Curtis uses tongs to grab pieces of fried oyster. Looking up, he can see back through the kitchen to an open door outside. Dewart stands there over a butane fired frying pot. He wears an apron and stares at Curtis. Curtis moves down the line.
What're you doin' here?
Not here man. Dewart taps him on the shoulder again.
I said what are you doin' here. Curtis stands and Dewart takes a step back. The general noise of the place starts to quiet down as people take notice. A few stand.
Curtis.
I told people what you been doin'.
I know.
You cut me loose. Everything we been through.
I know. I'm sorry. Dewart shoves him in the chest.
You ain't fucking sorry. You sorry you wouldn't cut me loose. We fuckin' friends! This how you treat friends? Curtis places a hand on Dewart's chest.
Come on. Dewart punches Curtis in the face. It stings.
God dammit.
You think I'm crazy?! Huh! Is that what he told you! Curtis TURNS OVER A TABLE. He points to the gawking crowd.
Well, listen up! There is a storm comin' like nothing you have ever seen. And not a one of you is prepared for it.
Sleep well in your beds. Cause if this thing comes true, there ain't gonna be any more. Curtis looks down at Dewart. He turns to see Hannah. She's tucked under her Mother's leg crying. This hits him hard. He stops. Looking at Samantha, his eyes fill with tears.
Hannah? He pulls his head out from the hood and sees Hannah standing on the curb. She looks down the street. He runs down his driveway, wiping his hands on a rag and watching the horizon.
Hannah! A FLOCK OF BIRDS, flying in intricate geometric patterns, swarm above the house at the end of the street. They twist and bend into speckled black shapes. Hannah, watching, walks into the street. Curtis catches her by the hand. He turns away from the birds to see a STORM CELL building on the opposite horizon. He scoops Hannah into his arms, stepping back from it. The SOUND of the birds grows louder. Curtis pivots to find the mass of birds barreling down the street toward him. He turns away as the wall of birds crash past him. The force so powerful it knocks him backward. He covers Hannah's head, dodging the onslaught of wind and wings. The Flock passes. Curtis stands, his face cut and scraped. Hannah cries, clinging to his chest.
The windshield of a car parked next to him SHATTERS. Curtis looks at the broken glass. A dead bird, it's neck broken, rests crumpled on the hood.
Curtis! Wake up! Wake up! TORNADO SIRENS continue to scream throughout the neighborhood. Curtis looks to the window. Rain and hail are battering the house. He jumps to his feet and grabs Samantha by the arm. They rush out of the room.
Come on. It's okay. Curtis leads them through the entry to the larger section of the shelter. Samantha takes Hannah and sits with her on one of the cots. She's signing to her, trying to calm her down.
It's okay. All right. Come on. Sit down. Curtis goes to a trunk in the corner and begins rooting through it. He removes two gas masks and an oxygen mask connected to a small tank. He goes over and kneels in front of Hannah. He tries slipping the oxygen mask over her face. Samantha grabs his wrist.
No. Don't do that.
It's okay. It's oxygen. Here. Put this on. Curtis hands Samantha a gas mask.
Are you kidding?
Please just do it. Okay? He looks to Hannah and places an oxygen mask over her face..
There we go. All right. Keep it out of your eyes. Okay? He signs to her.
Hey. I love you. It's okay. Curtis eases on the knob at the top of the tank. He climbs onto the cot and puts his arm around them. He slips on his gas mask. Samantha is hesitant. She looks at her husband in the mask and leans back against the side of the container. Hannah looks up at her. She touches her mother's mask. Samantha slips on the gas mask.
Wake up babe. Curtis' head moves. He sees that Samantha and Hannah have removed their masks.
Where's your mask?
We took them off. It's fine. Take it off.
No. Curtis hesitates.
We're fine. Take it off. Curtis slips the mask off his face. Worried, he takes a breath.
You need to open the door now.
What?
What if it's not over?
It's over. Get the keys. Open the door. Curtis slowly gets to his feet. He sees the dark entryway to the original section of the shelter. Taking the lantern, he walks to it. Samantha and Hannah follow. Curtis stops just inside. He holds the lantern up, illuminating the padlocked metal doors. He looks back at his family, then climbs the steps. He places his hand on the door. He flinches.
It's still storming.
No. It's not.
I can hear it. Samantha stares at him. The room is silent.
I don't hear anything.
Put your hand on the door. You can feel it. He takes Samantha's wrist and guides her to the doors. He watches her face as she places a hand against the metal. She looks at him, her eyes getting red, and shakes her head "no". Curtis kneels in front of Hannah and mimics the signs from earlier.
 Thunder? Do you feel it?
 You feel it? You feel it? Hannah walks to her mother. Samantha holds onto her. Curtis steps back from them. They watch him, their backs to the doors. He flinches and covers his mouth.
I'm sorry.
Baby, there's no storm outside.
I'm sorry. Samantha walks over to him.
Curtis. I wouldn't lie to you. We love you very much. Please open the door. Curtis is on the verge of tears. He slowly reaches into his jeans pocket. He removes the keys. He holds them out to Samantha.
I'm sorry. I can't. Samantha looks at the keys, then at Curtis. Tears shake from his trembling face.
I love you, but if I open the door, then nothin's gonna change. You'll see that everything's fine, but nothing will change. Please. This is what it means to stay with us. This is something you have to do. He looks at Hannah, then Samantha. Curtis steadies himself, trying to control his flinching. He wipes his face with the back of his hands and takes a deep breath. Curtis walks toward the doors. On the steps, he reaches up to the padlock. The keys shake in his fingers. He turns to Samantha.
Could you move Hannah back?
It's blinding. Curtis holds his hand up to cover his eyes. He stares up at a crystal blue sky. Samantha watches as Curtis steps out of the shelter.
Samantha steps out of the shelter holding Hannah. She surveys the damage.
It's fine. She walks over to Curtis and hugs him. He kisses Samantha on the head. Curtis looks up at the sky.
Do you have any vacation time that you could use?
I don't have a job right now.
Well, I know that times are hard, but I think it's really important for you to separate yourself from that storm shelter.
I think you need to break away from it for awhile. We can start you on some medication that I think will help, but that action alone would mean a lot.
We usually go on a trip to Myrtle Beach every summer. We were gonns go this month.
I think that would be okay if we start the medication now. It would give you all some time to prepare as a family, but I want to be clear, when Curtis gets back he'll need to take more time than that.
What does that mean?
I mean that he'll need hands on therapy at a real facility. Curtis looks up for the first time.
You mean I have to leave my family.
I think you need to seriously commit to some treatment. Curtis processes this. Samantha takes his hand.
 Hey. Good, huh? Hannah sits on her knees in front of Curtis sprinkling dry sand over castle shaped mounds already formed.
Good. We put a top on it. Curtis smooths out the sand in the castle shaped bucket and turns it over to top off their sand mound. He hands the bucket over for Hannah to refill. The SOUND of the waves behind them has STOPPED. They don't notice. Curtis takes two fingers and digs a small trench around the sand castle.
What is it honey? Curtis misses it. He shakes his head, "no", and Hannah signs again, slowly: "S-T-O-R-M".
What? Curtis turns to the shoreline, getting to his feet. He looks down at Hannah, who watches, mesmerized. Scared, she looks to her father. He grabs her under the arms and rests her on his hip. She buries her head into his chest.
Sam. Samantha looks down at her palm. She rubs the thick, viscous rain in her fingers. She looks back up at the storm. On Samantha's face,
Okay.
