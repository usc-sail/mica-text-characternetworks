 Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.
 Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
Right... Think it over.
 If you don't all calm down I'm gonna drive this thing over a cliff.
 Ah... youth.
Okay, Timmy... hold that smile... and watch the birdie.
There.
These should be in the mail to you by next Friday.
 Next.
 Whoa. Look at those babies.
 How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Mrs.?
I'm separated.
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
 If I were you, I'd breast feed until I was 17 or 18. (gets behind camera; sizing up the shot) Tell ya what...
Why don't you lean into the picture with your child?
 A-huh. A little more... good!
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
 Of course.
Now lean in a little more... more... more...
 Hold that pose.
Where'd she go?
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
Okay... be right with ya.
Pictures a family will cherish forever.
Hey, Chulo, where are you, man?
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
 Roberto, you finished fixing that lighter yet?
 I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Yeah. What is it?
I've decided not to run for President.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Manuel, be sure and finish up the electrical system on that Chevy.
 Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting. (hangs up and sees the guys standing there) Hi, guys.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Screw you...
 Hello, Concert tickets... What? Pat Benitar has a yeast infection? She's cancelling? Screw her. You know what this is gonna cost me?...  Okay. Let's go.
 Screw you... That's crap... Suck my...  Oh, Mom, I didn't know it was you... eggs and milk... Okay, I won't forget.
Let's go.
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Yeah, he's really got his thing together.
Oh, eat me!
Waiter.
We'd like to order now.
How you guys doin'... Could you believe how overcast it was this morning? Bad day for sailin', waves are too rough and...
 You can skip the small craft warnings. We're in a hurry.
No prob, bud... Here's today's dealie...
We got... uh, veal... ah... veal...  What's this word?
Parmisan.
Yeah right. I always want to say Paramisian when I see that. We looked at them under the jigamabob in biology once. Little squirmy, creepy things that live in your intestine and...
Please... We have an appointment in a half hour...
Wow, sounds stressful. What do you guys do for a living?
We're lawyers.
Whoa... You got to go to school for that or what?
 Look, forget the specials. We'll take three hamburgers.
Okay, great... Any of you guys got a pencil by any chance?
 All right, a Bic... How 'bout a piece of paper?
Ryko. Come on!
Be right there.  Nice rappin' with you guys. Unfortunately I'm outta here. Someone else will have to help you.  Skip!
Like um... What's the deal, you guys gonna order?
Hi pals.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Man, you're losing your audience.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
What?
You're kidding.
I don't believe it.
Fuck me!
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
Hey, man, congratulations!
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
You sure? This means no more partying.
No more raping and pillaging, either. You'll have to carry on without me.
Next Saturday... That's just two more weeks to live.
Hold it... As long as you're gonna go through with this, the least we can do is make sure you go out in style.
 Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Let's have a toast.
To Rick.
To us.
To girls with big pairs.
I'd like to pay for these.
Huh... What... Oh sure, wait till this song is over.
Excuse me, where can I try on these pants?
Right over here.
 Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
What's happening?
Debbie's marrying Rick.
...Really?
Yes, it's true.
Ohmygod.
 Would you get out of here.
Does Cole know about this?
Really -- you went with him for two years.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
 I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
Oh, that's really sweet. I'd love that.
We'll invite all the girls.
I don't believe it... Mrs. Rick Stahl.
 God, you're a slob.
But a fabulous cook.
What are we having?
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
 I think your dinner's burning.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
 Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event. (he brings all the food to the table) Well, what do you think?
It looks awful.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
Deb, you is my woman now. I is yo man. No painted lady ever gonna come between us.
I need you to promise.
Okay, you got it. I got a way we can seal the deal -- what'd you say?
 Cole?... Cole!
Cole?
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Hi, Deb. Just got back from the mountains. (as he cuts in with a surgeon's skill) Isn't this a beauty?... It's gonna look great in the den.
Cole, we've got to talk.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
No, Cole, I...
 It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
 You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
 I'm going now, Cole.
I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
Okay, Rick, hold out your arm.
You wouldn't hurt your own brother, would you? (looking at the needle cautiously) I changed my mind. I don't need a blood test. The marriage is off. I --
 You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
 You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
 That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
 Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
 Don't say anything to my wife about it.
Hi, Tina.
 Rick...  Mr. Goldsmith, this is my brother-in- law. He's getting married.
 Congratulations.
Nurse, will you take over?
 I'm so happy for you.
Oops!
 All right, who serves?
You do, Daddy.
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
Can't I just maim it a little?
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
No. Let's at least finish the set.
One of these days I'm gonna burn Thomerson's court to the ground.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
I'd love that.
 Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Feel free.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
Great, Mom.
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Ilene, Rick promised...
Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
 Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
Well, sir, that's quite a list. But you're absolutely right. And if I work hard at it, I think I can be a totally changed person by the time we finish lunch...
I hate those people... I really do.
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Good to see you, Mrs. Thomerson. Hello, Debbie.
 And...
Bond... James Bond.
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Sure have...
Why is Cole here?
You know your father enjoys his company.
Much the way Hitler enjoyed hanging out with Mussolini.
Nice shot.
Thank you, sir.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Yes, sir, I am.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
I've tried to change her mind.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
But how can I do that?
If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
 Thanks for the advise, sir.
Keep me informed.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
You can tell a man by his friends.
They're not such a bad bunch.
No?  That's his best man peeing on a tree.
If everyone would take their positions...
 Oh, dear. Well, let's begin. And...
Flower Girls... Now Rick... (he gestures for him to start down the aisle) Good... Debbie and Mr. Thomerson.
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
I want Debbie.
Cole...
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Five thousand dollars.
No.
Seventy-five hundred.
Not interested.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I'm marrying Debbie.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
 What is this person's story here?
The way I see it, the big lug is in love and he's got a lot of major appliances lying around.
Cole, what are you doing here?
He's just trying to save you from making a mistake.  A big mistake.
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
 Rick, me and you aren't through yet.
 Ladies and gentlemen, Cole Whittier. Let's hear it for him -- a funny, funny guy. We love ya, babe.
 You think the gods are telling me something?
 Huh? Wha...
I can't sleep.
Oh... I got something for that.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
What's the matter?
I don't know... I just feel scared.
 About what?
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
C'mere.
That feels so great.
Good...
Um... that's very relaxing.
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
 Close your eyes... that's it... There's nothing to worry about... I love you... I'm a great guy...  In two days you're gonna be Mrs. Great Guy.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
Don't worry, Chulo, the party's not gonna start without you. We got plenty of time.
I can't wait to see old Larry... It's been five years.
At least.
Where the hell is he?
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
There he is... Hey, Larry!
 Guys... guys... guys...
'Ludes... 'ludes... 'ludes.
God, I love you guys.
 This makes me so happy.
So, Larry, how have you been?
Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
So how's your wife?
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
 You want to share it?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Right.
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
 What do you mean, it changes?
 Larry, how are you?
Hi, Debbie, congratulations. Hey, do you know where there's a pharmacy around here so I can get a prescription filled?
Come on, get him on the bus.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
You better not have too much joy.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
 Gonna get married...
Going to the chapel and we're gonna get married.
Gee, I really love you...
And we're gonna get ma-a-a-ried.
 Going to the chapel of love.
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah.
Going to the chapel of love.
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
You're really pissing me off.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Your mother's not dead.
Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
I love you.
 What's the matter?
 Nothing... Let's get crazy!
All right!
When do the girls get to the party?
Don't worry, Gary's taking care of that now.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Let's see your bread.
 Okay, I got just what you're looking for.  Margot... Darlene...
They'll do just fine. Hiya, girls. Look, after the orgy, maybe we could have coffee.
Shorty, where's the party?
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
Hi. I must have just missed my friend. He hired you for a bachelor party.
At the Park View Hotel, Room 1002. What about it.
Yeah. Right. (takes out piece of paper) This is the new address. We changed our minds and decided to send the girls over to his house instead.
 And here's a fifty... I want this to be a surprise, so you never saw me, okay?
 No problem.
 Now she'll see what kind of jackoff he is.
Be careful with it. It's a rental.
 We who are about to go ape shit salute you.
All right, I'm stoked!
Just where do you guys think you are?
The Library of Congress?
Detroit?
Beyond the sun?
Are any of those right?
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
It's on the tenth floor.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
Do you have any more of this dip, Mrs. Thomerson? It's really excellent.
You just ate Purina Cat Chow.
Gross me out...
 What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
What do you mean?
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
You're kidding.
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
1004, 1003...  Aha! 1002.
 And now...
 ...to our honored guest Rick, and his life-long friends, I say...  ...gentlemen, start your boners.
Bitchin' place.
I did the balloons myself.
 Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
What's first?
A bit of a warm-up.
 We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Olivier's in that, right?
Then it's on to the real thing.
 All right!
They're Danish, I know it. I'm crazy for Danes.
 Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
 And I thought we wouldn't have any meaningful conversation.
 All right, yeah, yeah, yeah...
 Awwww...
Yes, go, go, yes, go...
 Awwwwww...
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
This isn't right.
Please, yes, do it, yes, yes, oh yes...
Where are the dirty parts? I'm a doctor. I can see these things.
What a waste of two women.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
 Women!
Yes?
 Yeah, hi. Look, is this...
838 North Franek Avenue?
Yes.
We're here.
How nice.
I'm Tina Stahl.
Of course. Stan's wife... Everyone come in.
Tina!
 You know everyone here, don't you?
Yes.
One of these, huh?
Looks that way.
Buck's a buck.
It's so heavy.
 Is there an empty outlet in here?
If I was Ricky Ricardo I would beat the shit out of that chick.
 Wow! The colors are sooo beautiful.
 Isn't there any beer that's not imported? All this stuff's from St. Louis.
 Bartender, round of brains for my friend here.
How's it going, guys?
Where's the girls? Where's the girls?
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
What's going on?
Nothing. We got no women.
Screw you.
It's true.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
 Guy paints a beautiful picture.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Screw that.
So, what do you guys think of the party so far?
 Well, I think you've done a damn fine job.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
I don't want any trouble.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
 Ooh, be still, my heart.
 See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
Very nice...
 Isn't that a great car, Chulo?
Yeah... real nice. Ah, excuse me. I'll be right back.
Great car.
The best.
I love that car.
I'm very happy for you two.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
 The car for Debbie?
 I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
 What a decision here.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
So does Debbie.
I got the car only two months ago -- it's got --
 Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Maybe it had something to do.
Shit!
Odd. He's only been gone a few seconds and I already miss him.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Screw you!
 That's it, prick lips.
What are you...
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Why?
Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
 Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
 Give him the works.
That's more like it.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
 Yeah.
 I don't know about this.
C'mon, Mother, it'll be fun.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
Check out the other guy's buns.
Let's sit over here.
C'mon, Mom.
 Yes... is there a Rick Stahl registered there?
Hookers beat you up?
Yes.
I didn't know you were into that.
How could you be so stupid. I'm gonna kill you.
Go ahead, but if you want women, we need more money.
This just isn't righteous.
 Screw you... Do me a favor, join this decade, will ya, pal!
 Help this person help others get laid. Give till it hurts. He needs you.
And there's our first pledge coming in --
 Hello. End Horniness Telethon. Yeah. Michael... how you doing?
I'm working... Right. At Chippendale's. Guess what. Debbie and her friends just walked in.
 Really? That's very interesting.  I'll tell you what... stay there and we'll be right down. I want to check this out.
I'll be back with women.
I might as well have left my genitals at home, the good they're doing me here.
 Hurry back.
 While we're waiting for Gar, why don't we all go for a little fresh air.
Where we going?
Out.
 Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
I just want to be alone.
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
 220-1892. Right.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
A real turd.
 Well... hope she'll be very happy.
So will your friend Nick do it?
He'll do anything for money.
I love his attitude.  They still out there?
Breathing heavy at ringside.
 So, they want action, eh? Are you with me, me hardies?
Guys, this is Chippendale's star attraction, Nicholas Carter... better known as Nick the Dick.
Nick the what?
 The Dick.
Let's get this thing going. Tray, please.
 Looks good. Can I have the bun, Michael?
 And now, Nick... or is it Mr. Dick?
Nick.
Nick, if you would be so kind...
Nick, the rest is all yours.
 Gentlemen.
If you ladies would like to serve yourselves...
Is this the foot long?
And then some.
She looks up just in time to see the guys close the kitchen door.
Ladies... come here.
Talk to the pimp.
Let's talk.
 What can I be doing for you?
You're a pimp?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I want women.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
I'll take some.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Milt?
This being Milt.
 Girls back in 45 minutes or Milt cuts your balls off. Fair enough? Shake!
 I just bet my balls and shook on it.
 Larry! Yo, Larry.
 What are you doing?
I'm killing myself.
Larry... you've got to lighten up. You and the wife can work it out.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
You okay?
Yeah, I guess so.
Really?
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
 He ain't all right.
Hello?
Mr. Thomerson.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Yes I did.
Fine. How's everything going?
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
 Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Hey, man, your car's looking good.
 Where is it?
Out front.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
 Rick... Rick... Goddamn it.
Gee. I think that's for me.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
 Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
 You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
 Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
 Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
I'm not really hungry.
C'mon. I insist.
...couple more on rye. Lots of fries... and a burger and diet soda.
Let's sit down.
What the hell is that?
My gift to you.
Under the table!
The best table in the house.
...I think we can skip the wine list. Oh, gee...
Boys, good evening to you.
Father Falwell, good evening.
Father... Oh, yes... yes... yesssss... Oh, yesssssss!
So, Rick, soon you will be a married man. How does it feel?
Innnnnn-credible!
Well, nice seeing you both.
Ooooooooh, Jesus, Oh God, God, God, God, Oh Jesus, Jeeeesussss...
 I was just saying grace.
How nice.
You done?
Not yet.
Father, would you like to take our table?
Yes. Thank you.
I think you'll enjoy this table.
So long, Father.
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
Where the hell is everybody?
Surprise! (gesturing to the girls) The team bus just pulled in.
Hookers. It's a party!
All right!
Who's first, guys?
Oh, me... me... me!
Wait. The guest of honor should be first.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
A moving plea. Okay, Doc, you lead off. I'll screw clean up.
How thoughtful. A drug smorgasbord.
I have returned!
 You! Mine!
 Chulo's got such a nice, light touch with women.
Terrific. You made it... You can set up over there...
 Great bathing suit.
 I think I screwed that one once.
I had his weiner right in my hands.
I told you. Men are pigs... I saw them standing there.
What a gross thing to do... gawd!
I bet right now Rick and his pals...  ...are knee deep in whores.
A strange wang right in my palm.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
That's what we're going to find out...
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Good. That's just what we're doing.
I'll kill Stan if I find out he's been screwing around.
Brett, are you with us?
 Yeah, sure... I was eye to eye with an unfamiliar pud.
Hey, Gary, spot me.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
Hi.
Hello.
You guys better get going. It's getting late.
Oh, right.
Is there a party going on in there or something?
Yeah. It's great. Go on in.
My God. Fresh meat. Let's hurry back.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
 Ha, ha, ha.
No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
 This time it's real. She's wonderful.
The name's Tim. I'm always available.
By the way... I also do engine work on BMW's. 'Bye.
All right.
Rick, I'm concerned.
About what?
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
 Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Oooooo.
 Right in there, pal.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
That's the old Rick!
Hellooo!
 Eat my chair!
Take me... please.
You promised me, Rick. You promised you wouldn't make love to anyone else.
I can't do it.
You nuts? Look at me, I'm beautiful!
Do it! Come on! Put her away! Go for it!
 Don't Rick.
I can't do it. I love Debbie.
How'd it go?
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
I'm proud of you, lad.
 Am looking for this dunghead who took my women... He is being liar to me. 45 minutes way over.
 Holy Dung is this thing! I sic Milt on you. He get back bitches. Me? I haul ass.
Who was that?
I don't know.
 What's this?
Got me.
 How 'bout this?
Still drawing a blank.
He look familiar?
Very.
C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
Stay away from me.
I'm not gonna hassle you... Don't worry. You look beautiful.
 Think so? I borrowed it from one of the girls. I don't look too fat?
You're an angel... A madonna.
You're on.
All right, here is your question, Miss... Er...
Rivas.
Miss Rivas... Yes... How would you solve our country's present economic problems?
Who, me?
Yes.
That's a good question. From the way I understand it, according to supply side economics, when supply exceeds demand, recession is the result. That's why I think we should control the credit markets and increase the prime rate. That way, the consumer price index will stabilize and we will have economic recovery.
How'd you know all that stuff? You're a real brain.
Nah, I used to fuck a librarian.
Wow!
I don't believe we're doing this.
Can I help you, ladies?
Yes, we're looking for the Stahl party.
Room 1002.
 Those guys are asking for it.
You're making a big mistake.
Shut up. You still got another job to do here.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
Quiet, Mother.
Get in there.
Nice looking quim, huh, Bob?
Yeah, you know me, Ray, I've always been a sucker for redheads.
Hubba-hubba.
Let's get out of here, girls.
Guys, take it easy. Guys.
This is it. (he positions Tracey outside the door) Go get 'im.
Where the hell is he?
Yeah?
Make love to me... please.
T minus... 3... 2... 1. We have ignition.
Hey!
All set here.
You guys are never going to get away with this.
We're just going to keep you in a safe place until after the party.
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Take care.
 Don't you wish you were a guy so you could have fun like this?
Why don't you get comfortable?
 There's a wonderful moon out tonight.
 Hey, Bob, this beats the shit out of sushi, doesn't it?
Babe, I didn't know anything about that.
All right, can we have our five finalists, please.
Good luck, Laverne.
Thank you, Mr. Thomerson. Well, the judges have made their decision, and this year's Miss Moosehead Beer is...
Laverne Rivas.
 I can't believe it. This is the happiest day of my life, and I owe it all to him.
I know I've had that girl.
 And I know that guy from somewhere, too.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
I don't know.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
 I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Hey, you guys...
Who's your friend?
 Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
 Say no more.
I don't know which one of you did this, but you're not going anywhere till you clean up this disgusting mess.
 Anybody got a paper towel or a shovel or something?
I'll have the boy take your bags up.
 Excuse me. I seem to have a hand full of potty.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
Any time, Al.
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
 The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
1002.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Yes, sir.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
It's Bullwinkle.
Gentlemen... Ladies... For your viewing pleasure, meet Mike the Magical Sexual Mule.
 How about this, a Trojan donkey.
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
Swell. She's gonna pin her tail on the donkey.
C'mon, Mike... Come to Mama.
 Hey, you guys, I'm getting married.  We're gonna make lots of kids.
What the hell happened?
Drug overdose.
You mean it's...
Afraid so. I did everything I could.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
C'mon, we gotta get this thing out of here.
 Yes... I see... Of course we don't allow that sort of thing here, ma'am. No... Well, I'm sorry the noise woke you. I'll take care of it right away.
I've had enough of this.
 That's it. I'm calling the cops.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Rick!
 Oh, no!
Christ... it's Mr. Laughs.
This is it. You're through. When Debbie hears about this she'll never see you again. Now I'm calling the cops to break up this sex orgy... And toss your ass in jail!
What are you going to do about it?
 What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
I'll stop him... You stall him.
Mr. Thomerson!
 Please, no. Don't ruin my life. Please!
 It's not me. I was brought up on the wrong side of the tracks. A victim of my environment...
Is that all the coke in the place?
That's it.
Good.
My poor old mammy had to take in laundry. My pappy had to work 20 hours a day at the Pez Factory.
The end.
No sob story is going to change my mind.
The phone's all yours.
I never liked you. I've never liked any of your friends. I've hated you from the first time I saw you. And now you are out of my life. You are out of my life!
Reach out and snort someone.
I'm saved. Let's party!
Let's give them what they want.
What?
Let's go. Everyone inside.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
 Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Let's go.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Ilene, are you crazy?
I know what I'm doing... Go!
Gentlemen, the gods have answered your prayers... Bonzai!
I hope Ilene's all right.
I hope those guys are all right.
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
Who?
Debbie.
My Debbie?
What's with her costume?
 I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
You got it.
 Hi, baby. You're new here. I don't think the groom's had you yet, has he?
No, not yet. Where is he?
I can't see anything.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
Why don't you get undressed.
 It's a lovely day in the neighborhood. It's a lovely day, it's a beauty, would you be mine, could you be mine. (he's now stripped down to his underwear) ...Please won't you be my neighbor.  Hi... Hi there... Today we're going to learn about anatomy...
 Debbie... you're a hooker! I can't believe it!
I can't trust you!
C'mon, I knew it was you.
 Rick, you're lying!
 Let go of me!
 Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
I am committed. I love you.
I don't believe you.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
 People! Can I have your attention... people!
 I want to ask you all a question. Have I had sex with anybody in this room tonight?
 Are you sure?
 Thank you.
 See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
 Yes...
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
 Let's get naked.
You're on.
 Daddy?
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
You're all under arrest. Open up!
 Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
 I'm glad no one is panicking.
 Break it in, boys!
Ed! What are you doing here?
 Ed... you're kinky!
The phone made me do it!
 You've been having strange sex...!
No, Brett, I...
It's all right...  So have I.
I've seen another man's diddly.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
She's mine!
He's kidnapped her! Everyone into the bus!
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
Fan out and look for them.
Aw, I've seen this one already.
 Gee, what a realistic effect.
Yeah, like you're in the movie with them.
 Best 3D I've ever seen.
 Are you okay?
Yeah.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
 You're so romantic...
Absolutely amazing.
I've seen better.
 Hey, man, don't forget my bachelor party's next Friday night.
I'll get the hookers.
No way.
 We'll have morons for grandkids.  But... at least we'll have grandkids.
Sue!
Hi, honey.
How'd you get here?
Rick called me.
Why don't we go someplace and talk.
Now, before I pronounce you man and wife, the groom wishes to recite his vow to Debbie. Richard.
They fear the worst.
Oh, God Almighty.
Cheese. I love you more than cheese. And I love cheese a lot.
They hide their faces in their hands. Off in the distance a storm is coming in fast over the ocean. The wind begins to pick up. Undaunted, Rick continues his soliloquy.
In fact, more than dairy products in general. I love dairy. My love is cream. Pour me on the cereal of your life...
Rick. Rick. Hey...
I think this song pretty much sums up the way I feel at this moment.
 I now pronounce you man and wife. Goodbye.
