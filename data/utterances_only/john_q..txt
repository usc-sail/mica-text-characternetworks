Honey, what is it?
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Aw, come on. That's my car.
What's going on?
Sorry.
I talked to the bank. They promised they'd work with me.
Okay.
I did.
John, that was two months ago.
We've got enough money for next month's rent. That's it. It was either the car or the house, so I thought...
You thought.
What did you want me to do? Have us put out on the street? I'm down to twenty hours a week a the plant. They shipped off half the damn jobs down to Mexico.
My car is gone, John.
You know I'm out there trying to find a second job.
What do you want me to say? That it's fine? Alright, it's fine.
The car's still ours, Denise. We own it. All we have to do is wait two weeks until my check comes in.
Yah! Ronnie Coleman, Mr. Olympics two years running. Yah!
Sit down, honey. Eat some breakfast.
 I am eating.
A donut isn't breakfast.
Yeah it is. It's a continental breakfast.
Yeah, well, you're not a continent right now.
Uh, Dad, what do you call North America?
Enough about that. You're not going to school without breakfast. Now eat. Both of you.
I can't believe those jerks took our car, can you, Mom?
No, I can't.
What are we going to do? You're not going to do something, right, Dad? You know what I'd do? I'd get so big and mad, I'd just go crazy and kick someone's butt.
Watch your language.
I would. I swear. When I grow up I'll be so strong no one will ever take nothing from us.
You've been watching too much of that W.W. wrestling.
Not wrestling, Dad. Body building. There's a big difference.
Alright, alright. Get your books. You're going to be late.
Give me a ride to work?
Sure.
Baby, things will get better. I promise. I've just got to get a few paychecks ahead, that's all.
Rdshxshn.
Reddish Stick?
No. Rdshxshn.
Radishes?
Rdshxshn.
I swear to God, I'm hearing reddish stick.
It's a radio station.
Oh, brother. You got me.
Ydugskew.
Yogurt and Stew?
Well, I don't know. Do it again.
Ydugskew.
I give up.
You're going to school.
Dad!
Okay. One more.
Iplglgnstheflgvthntdstscvmrcndthrpblcfw chtstndsnntnndrgdndvsblewithlbrtyndjstc rll.
Pledge of allegiance.
Wow. That's a good one. How about you, Mom?
I don't want to play. You guys always make fun of me.
Come on, Mom. It's fun.
Yeah, Mom.
Okay.
Dashboard.
What? No good? Okay. Okay. Hold on.
Antenna.
See. That's why I don't play.
Hey, Dad? I've got forty-six dollars I saved from my allowance. You can have it if you want.
Yeah?
We're a family. We've got to stick together, right?
Right. But you earned that money. You keep it.
Okay. See you later!
Goodbye.
No, Dad. See you later. I hate goodbye.
Okay, okay. See you later.
Flex Wheeler, 275 pounds. Two percent body fat. Yah!
What's the deal with the jacket? Who died?
I've got a job interview at the machinery plant over in Otisville.
What job? There are no jobs.
I saw it in the paper.
Forget it.
I've got to go. Denise is going to kill me if I don't find something. They repo'd her car this morning.
Oh, boy. You want me to go with you?
This is a waste of time. Four hundred people for one job. Give me a break.
I'm telling you, somebody's son, cousin, uncle has already got this job sewn up.
Jimmy, why do they put it in the paper if they're not hiring?
They've got to put it in the paper to make it look good. State law or something.
Give it a rest, will you?
I'm just saying, it's the run around. Mark my words. It's either, 'We'll keep your application on file.' That's the kiss of death. Or they tell you that you're overqualified. Either way, you're screwed.
John Archibald?
I've been working heavy machinery for fifteen years. I really want this job. Whatever you need, I can do.
I see.
Hey, I could start today.
Your resume is very impressive. You've certainly got the experience. Frankly, you might be overqualified.
The game starts in fifteen minutes. We're gonna be late.
I know.
Dad!
Sorry, Reverend. No time for saving souls today. Big game.
Have you been saying your prayers like we talked about?
Does praying for a job count?
Work on him, will you, Denise?
He's hopeless.
No one's hopeless. Good luck!
Let's go, Orioles!
Pitcher's got a rubber arm!
Ball four!
Way to go, Tommy. Good eye. Walk's as good as a hit.
Yeah, Mike! Drive him home, baby! You can do it!
Hey, pitcher! Hey, pitcher!
That's okay, Mikey. Put the bat on the ball.
Strike two!
Hey, ump, you're blind! I hate this pitcher. How old is he, anyway?
He's supposed to be twelve.
Twelve, my ass. Look at him. His beard just grew an inch between pitches!
Don't let him rattle you, Mikey. Wait for your pitch.
No way! He was out!
Second base!
Mike! Jesus God.
Mike?! Mikey, can you hear me?
Somebody call an ambulance.
I'm not waiting for an ambulance.
Help! My son can't breathe! I need help here! Can somebody please...
What happened?
I don't know. He had a baseball game. All of a sudden he...
I need a doctor right away. Room 6.
Pulse is 150. B.P. 68 over 34. Collapsed playing baseball.
He was running. Next thing we know he keels over.
Anything like this ever happen before?
Never. No, ma'am. Never.
Pulse is seventy-eight percent.
Let's get him on some oxygen.
He's going to be alright, isn't he?
The lungs are wet and his liver feels enlarged. Five mil I.V. Digoxin, stat.
What's the matter with him?
Mr. and Mrs. Archibald, would you come with me?
What?
He's in good hands. Please, there's a few procedures we need to go over.
What kind of procedures?
We're going to be admitting your son, sir. You'll need to fill out the proper forms.
For godsakes, can't the forms wait?
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. It's possible your son may need a transfusion. We'll need to test you both for blood types.
First name, Mr. Archibald?
John.
Middle initial?
Q. Quincy.
And the name of your insurance company?
John!
Where is he, is he okay?
I don't know. They're running tests. We're waiting to find out.
What can we do?
Your card, Mr. Archibald?
Huh?
Your insurance card. I'll need to make a copy for our files.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hey, slugger, how are you doing?
I can't...talk.
Relax, buddy. Get some rest.
I love you, kid.
What's all this?
This is so we can monitor Mike's vitals. Respiratory rate. Pulse oximetry. Heart rate. And this one is blood pressure. Diastolic and systolic.
We'd like this top number to stay above ninety, but between eighty-five and ninety is acceptable for now. Anything less than eighty is dangerous. If his blood pressure drops, we're going to have to do something. We can't have him going below seventy again.
What would that mean?
Seventy and below, he's in heart failure.
The father works part-time. Mother's a cashier in a supermarket.
how's the family's insurance?
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. Rebecca Payne, hospital director. This is Doctor Turner, head of our cardiology department.
How's our boy doing?
Please sit down.
This X-ray is that of a normal, nine year old heart. This one is your son's.
There are septal defects here, here, and here, which have induced a myopathy resulting pulmonary edema, and malignant ventricular ectopy. As you can see, Mike's heart is approximately three times normal size.
I'm sorry. I don't understand. Could you pout that in layman's terms?
Of course. Basically, there's not enough blood being pumped by the heart, so it backs up in the lungs. Sort of like a sponge getting wet. Mike's heart is trying, but I'm afraid it's working too hard.
So what's he need? An operation?
I'm afraid we're considerably beyond the point of corrective surgery, Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. Your son's heart is useless. He is going to need a transplant.
He's nine.
Wait a second. There are other options.
What options?
To do nothing. Medicate him. Keep him as comfortable as possible. You need to start thinking about quality of life now.
I don't understand. We were just with him. He seemed fine.
He's going to seem fine. But as his heart gets worse, he will become increasingly fatigued, need more and more sleep, until one day, he'll go to sleep and he won't wake up.
I know it's difficult, but you must face the fact that your son may not have much time left. You might want to make it a happy time. Say goodbye.
Oh my God.
And transplantation is a high risk operation. You could lose your son on the table. You may not want to take that chance.
What do you think, Dr. Turner?
This isn't my decision.
I know that. I'm asking for your opinion. Without surgery, how long does he have?
Not long. Months. Weeks. Days.
What would you do if it was your son?
Mr. Archibald...
Not you. Him.
I'd do the transplant. Absolutely.
Okay. Let's do it.
The first step is to get Mike's name on an organ recipient list. Once he does, his chances are very good. Your son's an extremely rare type so there's less demand. With B-positive blood, Mike could go to the top of the list right away.
It's not that simple. There are other considerations before a prospective recipient is placed on the donor list, Mr. Archibald. The cost of transplant surgery is expensive. In most cases, prohibitively so.
I've got major medical. Don't worry, I'm covered.
Actually, we've already checked with your carrier. There's no provision in your policy for a procedure of this magnitude.
There must be some kind of mistake. My son is covered. I've got full medical. He's covered.
What about you, Mrs. Archibald? Do you have coverage?
No. I've only been working at the market a short time. You need to be there two years before you get benefits.
I see that you don't own your own home. No investments, stocks, bonds. And you have a little over one thousand in savings.
Did you hear what I said? I'm telling you, I'm insured.
That may very well be, but you'll have to check with your carrier on that. In the meantime, I'm afraid we're going to have to treat you as a cash account.
How much does a transplant cost?
Transplant surgery, doctor fees, post operative treatment and immunosuppressant drugs, you're looking at two-hundred and fifty-thousand dollars minimum.
What are you saying? If I don't come up with a quarter million dollars you're not going to treat my son?
We have treated him. We continue to treat him. Now I understand how upset you are, sir. But with other options available, we are not obligated to cover a procedure this costly. If you opt for replacement surgery, that's your choice. But the hospital maintains a very strict policy with respect to cash patients. We require a down payment before the patient's name can be placed on the receiver list.
What kind of down payment?
Thirty percent. Seventy-five thousand.
Our son is upstairs dying and all you can talk about is money?
Yes, it takes money to provide health service. It's expensive for you and for us. My job is to keep this program alive. For everyone. Now, I'm sorry, but we need you to guarantee payment before we can place your son's name on the list.
Mr. and Mrs. Archibald?
You don't want to treat my kid? Fine. I'll take him over to County Memorial.
Trust me. You don't want to do that.
I don't, huh? Watch me. It's a county hospital. They have to treat him.
No they don't. Transplantation is always considered an elective procedure. This hospital's politics are particularly infuriating, but you're in the right place. Believe me. You want Dr. Turner. His bedside manner is terrible, but he's one of the foremost surgeons in the country.
What do you want us to do? You heard Payne. We're a cash account.
I know it's outrageous, but don't give up. Talk to your insurance company. Check with our Human Resources Department for medical assistance, State Children's Services, Medicaid. Just don't take no for an answer.
You coverage has changed, Mr. Archibald.
Changed?
We've recently switched carriers from a PPO to an HMO. It's a less expensive policy, but unfortunately it has some restrictions.
What kind of restrictions?
This is how it works. Non-management, part-time employees such as yourself only qualify for second tier catastrophic coverage.
But I'm not part-time. I'm a full-time employee. It's just slow right now.
Sure. But your coverage is based on house worked. Like I said, you only qualify for second tier, and that has a maximum payout limit of twenty-thousand dollars.
Wait a minute. I've been paying for my coverage for years. You take it out of my paycheck every week.
And that's why we're going to cover you for the full twenty.
Let me get this straight. You drop me from full-time to part-time, switch carriers, and now you're telling me I'm not fully covered even though I have a policy that says I am.
Doesn't seem right, does it?
No, sir. It doesn't. My son is very sick. If I'm not covered, I've got a serious problem.
I understand that, but there's nothing I can do. You might want to try State Services. Either that, or you can file an appeal.
Yeah?
Here are the forms. It'll take about seven working days.
Says here you already have medical insurance.
Not enough.
What little we have is already used up.
I understand that. But then you don't qualify. We only give assistance to patients without coverage. Are you on Welfare?
No.
You should be on Welfare.
Welfare? We both have jobs.
Oh, that's too bad. Sorry, I can't help you. Try MA.
It says here your son's condition is congenital.
Yeah?
Not congenitive.
So what? What's the difference?
Big difference. It means it's a pre existing condition, one your son was born with. A birth defect. Obviously, it pre-dates your coverage. Otherwise we could help.
That's impossible. He's had clean check ups every year.
I don't know what to tell you. It's right here in the report. Have you tried Medicaid?
No.
No, what?
You don't qualify.
Don't qualify? I've got a kid who's dying and I'm broke. If I don't qualify, who does?
Lower your voice, sir.
I mean, what do you guys do, anyway? Why does this service even exist?
I'm sorry.
I don't need you to be sorry. I need some help.
No, no, no. You filed an appeal? An appeal is for an already existing claim. What you needed to file was a grievance. You'll have to resubmit. But that could take up to thirty days.
I don't have thirty days.
I know that.
And, frankly, I'm tired of getting the runaround. I need my son's name on that list.
Mr. Archibald, your hospital bill is in excess of thirty thousand dollars. So far, we haven't received any kind of payment. We have bent over backward to help you.
Oh, is that right?
Yes, sir, that is right. But there is a limit to this hospital's generosity. Once and for all, you are not covered by insurance. We will need to guarantee payment.
You want money? Alright, I'll get you your money.
You know what you should do? You should try that newsguy that does all those special investigative reports. You know the one. The guy with the hair.
Yeah, yeah.
The trouble shooter. Channel eight. What's his name?
Lampley. Tuck Lampley.
Tuck Lampley. Hope you don't mind if I eat while we talk. I'm up to here today, you know? Go, go, go.
No, that's fine. Thanks for seeing us.
So, what can I do you for?
My son, Mike, went into heart failure playing in his little league game. I have full insurance through my work, but now they're saying they don't have to pay.
Why not?
Lots of reasons. He don't even understand half of them.
What about the hospital?
Hope Memorial Hospital.
Yeah, Hope Memorial. Don't they have to cover it?
Right, right? That's what I thought.
No. The hospital says I have to pay cash. Otherwise the only thing I can do is bring Mike home and watch him die.
Jesus.
Yeah.
Bureaucracy of the medical establishment, American family caught in the middle.
Right. Big guy versus little guy. We were thinking you could do one of them special interest pieces, you know? Send donations, write your congressman. That kind of thing.
Anything would help.
What they've done to your son is outrageous, and I want to help. But I've got to run it by my producers. I've got bosses, just like anyone else. So, leave me your phone number, and I'll get back to you.
Hey, sweetheart. How's Mike?
They're releasing him.
What?
Dr. Turner just left. They're sending Mike home in the morning.
What are you talking about? They can't just send him home. I gave them money yesterday.
It doesn't matter. They're releasing him.
But I spoke to the hospital. I took care of...
Yeah, you always take care of it. But it's never enough, is it? You need to do something, John. Do you hear me? Do something.
What's going on? Are we going to get seen or what?
The doctor will be with you shortly, sir.
You're doing great, Carroll. You've already gained back five pounds. I think you're the only patient I have who actually eats the food here.
Thanks for everything, doctor.
Hello, John. This is Mr. Archibald. His son's a patient of mine.
Well, you're certainly in good hands.
Denise said you're letting Mike go home.
Mr. Archibald, I'm a physician. I don't make policy decisions. That's handled by the board of trustees.
You're head of Cardiac Surgery, Doctor. You're telling me a person in your position makes a recommendation, no one's going to listen?
I make recommendations all the time. The final decision rests with the board. Not me.
You and your staff did over three hundred operations last year. It's right here on page 4 of the hospital brochure. Nice color pictures, happy faces. Three hundred plus surgeries at a quarter million a pop. That's seventy five million dollars your department took in. Couldn't you do just one on good faith?
Please take your hands off me.
I'm not asking for charity, Doc. I'll pay. I don't know how, but I swear to God, if it takes me the rest of my life, I will. You have my word as a man.
I'm sorry. I tried to help. But it's out of my hands.
I'm not asking anymore, Doctor. I'm telling. Now I want a new heart for my kid. You understand?
Don't even think about it.
Hey, what are you doing?
Hands over your head. Do it.
Give me your gun.
I, uh, don't have a gun.
Okay. Then sit down. And stay down.
Mr. Archibald, I understand how upset you are, but this is not the right way to handle it.
I tried your way, Doc. It didn't work. Now we're going to try it my way.
Mr. Archibald. What are you doing?
I took your advice, Doctor. I'm not taking no for an answer.
What's going on here?
They want me to sign.
Mr. Archibald, these people have nothing to do with this. You have got to let them go. They need treatment.
This is a hospital, isn't it? You're a doctor. Treat them.
Start with him.
What's the matter, Doc? You want to see his insurance card first?
This hospital is under new management, ladies and gentlemen. From now on, free care for everyone.
Far out.
You. Come with me.
Kill the power.
I don't have a key for that.
You've got the keys to the city. Now do it.
Everybody does exactly what I say and nobody gets hurt.
...more hurt.
This just came in over the police radio. Someone is holding Hope Memorial hostage.
Hope Memorial Hospital? Isn't that...?
Is it a good enough story for you now, George?
Do you think it's that guy with the kid, boss?
What do you think?
 We were here before that guy.
You'll get your turn. Nobody's going anywhere for a while.
I'm going to have to ask you to join the others, Miss.
What's the problem?
Yo no se que pasa. El llora por toda la noche.
Yo pienso que tiene dolor en su oreja.
Si? En su oido?
Porque lo toca. Mira.
This kid's got an ear infection. You.
I can't.
Why not?
I don't know anything. It's my first.
I got it. Give him this.
Unbelievable. This place is a joke. Good think I'm not cut. I'd bleed to death in this joint. Am I right, my man?
Excuse me? Hey, brother?
My girlfriend's in a lot of pain here. How much longer before she sees a doctor?
That's cool. You and me ain't got no problems. You know what I'm saying? But do me a favor, huh? Baby's pretty banged up, and we've been waiting for hours.
That's what we've been doing.
When is the baby due?
Any minute.
What's that?
Open up. Got a gunshot victim here. Lost a lot of blood.
Take him to another hospital.
He won't make it. Come on. We're losing him. Open the door.
 You recognize these guys?
Yeah, they're here all the time.
That one's a cop.
I was here when you brought in your son. Remember me? I shot straight with you then. I'm shooting straight with you now. I'm telling you, these guys are cool.
You, open your coat.
What?
You heard me. Take the coat off. Cop.
Alright, then. Leave the stretcher. Go. Beat it.
We need to prep this man for immediate surgery. He's in boo-koo trouble. Doctor?
No, no. This is out of my department. I'm a heart surgeon. I'm not an emergency room physician.
You are now.
Come on, Doctor. It's like riding a bike. Pretend you're getting paid.
Do it.
Seventy-five milligrams Demerol IV Lidocaine, local. Two percent.
When I get out of here, I'm suing this hospital and your security company.
What makes you so sure you're getting out of here at all?
Here we go.
What are you doing here, Lampley? Shouldn't you be out exposing tragic miscarriages or justice or something?
Yeah, well, screw you, too.
There's a rumor floating around, Frank. Some guy's holding the hospital hostage. Needs an operation for his kid. Any truth to it?
You know more than I do.
You're full of shit.
Hey, then we're even. I never believe a word you guys say either.
This is big, isn't it, Frank? I can feel it. Come on, what do you got?
Zip. Nothing. Read my lips. I just got here. But I promise, as soon as I know anything, you'll be the last to know.
Hey, Grimes. You're a real horse's ass. You know that?
Yeah, well...
This guy's in for the long haul, Lieutenant. He locked down the ER, barricaded himself inside, killed the power on the elevators. We could bust down the door, but the sonofabitch might start killing everybody.
Any other way in?
I'm working on it.
How many hostages?
Security guard here said there could be anywhere from ten to twenty.
Any security cameras?
Pinpoint cameras? I don't understand.
They're hidden in the walls throughout the hospital. There's two inside the ER area.
Can we get them?
We're setting up a video tap right now. Should be up and running in a few minutes.
Are you in charge of security?
Not anymore it ain't. Get him down here.  I need to make contact with this guy. Can you get me a secure line?
Alright, but put a clamp on all phone lines to the Emergency Room. If he picks up the phone, I want him talking to me.
Got it.
And keep the media on a need to know basis. Until I say so, the press doesn't need to know nothing. Now who's in charge of this hospital?
Jesus Christ. Does anyone work at this hospital?
So what? People get sick on Saturday, don't they?
How old is he? Cuantos anos?
Ocho meses. Eight month.
Eight months. Great age.
I'll need to do an internal examination on this woman.
Go.
Why'd you come to an ER? Why not go right to Maternity?
Miriam went into labor early. Her water broke, we called our doctor, got the service.
Excuse me, but I think my fiancee broke her arm. Could somebody take a look at her, please?
She's fine, ain't she? All that and twenty-two years old. Little slice of heaven. Must be doing something right, am I right?
 What's your story?
Car accident. What does it look like?
I was talking to her.
A drunk ran a red light and slammed into us. It was an accident.
Hello? Hello? Anyone there?
Yeah.
This is Lieutenant Frank Grimes of the Chicago Police Department. Are you the man in charge?
That's right.
Who am I speaking to?
Come on, my friend. We're going to be doing a lot of talking today. You don't have to give me your real name, but I've got to call you something.
Call me John Q.
Alright, John Q. Again, my name is Lieutenant Grimes. But I want you to call me Frank. Can you do that?
Sure, Frank.
I'm the hostage negotiator. I've been a cop for thirty-five years and this is all I do. I don't play games. And I don't fool around. So if I say something, you can take it to the bank. Now, let's get down to it. Is anybody hurt?
It's an Emergency Room, Frank. Everybody's hurt.
They're fine.
Good. As long as it stays that way, we can keep talking.
Murphy's Law, John. You picked the hottest day of the year. It's a hundred degrees out here. And I'm allergic to the heat. So let's wrap this up as quickly as possible. Now, what exactly is it you want?
Find Rebecca Payne, Hope Memorial's Administrative Supervisor. Tell her I want my kid's name on the donor list.
Kid? Boy or girl?
Boy.
How old? You know, I've got two boys. Two girls and two boys.
Don't handle me, Frank. I don't want to be handled. It insults my intelligence. If I don't get what I want, you're going to have a lot of dead bodies on your hands. You only need to remember two things. My kid and the donor list. You got that?
Take it easy, John. The idea's not to get too excited.
Mike's name goes on that list or there's going to be a blood bath in here.
Alright. I hear you loud and clear. Rebecca Payne, right? I'm writing it down. Lot of cops out here, John. Are you sure you want to go through with this?
I'm sure.
Alright. Sit tight. You're in a tough spot, John. A lot of trouble. But if you work with me, if you're reasonable, we'll figure a way out of this. We have to have a little faith in one another.
Why?
Why? Because that's what faith's all about. Believing when you don't want to believe. Besides, what else are you going to do?
Just tell Payne. Donor list. She'll understand. EXT. HOPE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - COMMAND POST - DAY
Alright, what the hell is a donor list?
Mr. Q? Would you really do it?
What?
What you said about the bloodbath? Would you really shoot us?
I'll do what I have to do to help my kid.
Aw, bullshit. He can't shoot us all. There's only eight bullets in that weapon.
First one's got your name on it, Mitch.
First child?
Yes, sir. You know how it is, kind of nervous.
What are you hoping for? Boy or girl?
Miriam wants a baby girl. Doesn't matter to me, as long as the baby's healthy.
I'm sorry. I didn't meant --
Who was driving?  The car.
I was. What's that got to do with it?
How come she got all banged up and you didn't?
What do you call this?
Somebody get this man a band-aid.
Shut up, smart ass. It hurts.
His airbag went off. Mine didn't.
What kind of car do you drive there, hot shot?
Mercedes 500.
A Benz, huh?
Sixteen valve. One point six liter. It does about a hundred and eighty in reverse.
Wow. Pretty snazzy. What year?
1986. It's a classic.
Yeah, well, I've got news for you, Mitch. Mercedes didn't install passenger airbags until 1988.
I was drunk. Alright?
Well, well, well. My man, Mitch. Mister girlfriend beater. What do you got to say now, bitch?
How's Stawitzky?
He's going to make it.
How's it feel, Doc? Saving a life? Feels pretty good, doesn't it?
What's that?
Lasix. It's a diuretic to help get rid of some of the fluid build-up. But it's potassium sparing, so he needs this one to supplement.
And those?
Dopamine. For his blood pressure. Dig for his heart. Primacor.
Gosh, it seems like so much.
Yeah, it's a lot. This is antibiotic.
What for?
It's prophylactic. Just in case. These two, I don't really know what they're for. Pain, maybe.
Pain?
I don't know, Mrs. Archibald. I just do what they tell me.
I don't feel good.
This is going to make you feel yucky for a few minutes, buddy. But I'm going to get you some of those crunchy ice chips to chew on. How does that sound?
Mom? Is Dad coming?
Yeah. He's coming.
Where is he?
I don't know, sweetheart. I don't know.
What are you up to?
Never mind me. You're worthless. You know that? Some security guard. You should have zapped the bastard.
With what? Besides, I'm not putting my neck on the line. Not for eight-fifty an hour.
What the hell are you doing?
Looking out for number one.
You want to stay alive? Sit tight and wait for the cavalry to get here.
Wake up, fat boy. The cops are coming in shooting. They don't give a shit about his kid. And as soon as he realizes that, we're history.
Yeah? He finds out you got a scalpel, you're the one that's history, asshole.
Really? He doesn't look so bad to me.
Listen.
No, listen to me, you stupid rent-a-cop. I'm not a slob. I've got a life, and it means something to me. I'm not dying in this shithole.
The thing I don't understand is why no one caught it before. Mike had check ups every year since the day he was born. Why didn't his doctors pick it up?
Was he ever diagnosed with a murmur?
Yeah, he was. About a week after he was born. But his doctor said that was normal. That it happens all the time.
He might not have been tested thoroughly enough.
Why not?
You got an HMO, right? There's your answer. HMO's pay their doctors not to test. Their way of keeping costs down. Let's say Mike needed additional testing, insurance says they won't cover them. The doctor keeps his mouth shut and no one's the wiser. Little Mike falls through the cracks, and come Christmas, the HMO sends the doc a big, fat bonus check. J.Q. looks at Turner.
Is that true?
Possible. Not likely, but possible.
Then Mike's doctors could have known about his condition all along? And he could have been treated years ago?
Who knows?
Nothing personal, Doc, but you all are a bunch of damn crooks.
You see,here's the problem. Over here, you've got your insurance companies who basically want you healthy or dead. That's how they make money. And over here, you've got your medical establishment, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, who don't want you healthy or dead. They want you sick. That's the way they make money.
It's all about getting paid, man.
And the individual is caught in the middle of this gigantic tug-of-war. It's a game. And the end result is, people don't get the treatment they deserve.
Because then no one gets paid.
But what about that thing you guys take? That promise? What do they call it?
The Hippocratic oath.
More like the hipp-crit-cial Oath to me. How's that go, Doc? "I solemnly swear to take care of all sick folk, except those without major medical?"
I'm telling you, it's not that far from the truth. The shit happens all the time. Paramedics bring in some accident victim gasping for his last breath. Big boys in accounting find out they can't pay, they send them packing.
Hospitals can't turn people away.
Yeah. I thought there were laws about that.
There are laws. But there are also ways around the laws. All we have to do is stabilize them. After that, we're off the hook.
That's not how it works.
That's exactly how it works. Maybe not up there on the fifth floor, but down here, if you ain't got no money, you get a band-aid, a foot in the ass, and you're out the door.
Is that how you paid for that Armani suit, Doc?
Shut up. Enough already. I've heard all the bitching and moaning I can stand. Sure, the system sucks. There's red tape and there's worse. There's tough luck. And if you're looking for kindness and compassion, they're in short supply these days. But some of us got into medicine to do something about it. I break my ass every day trying to make a difference, trying to plug the dam. I'm in it up to my elbows. I've seen people live who shouldn't, and the other way around. And when I say I do my best, I mean it. So don't tell me about doctors, because they're the last stop between you and six feet under. And if you all want to regard me as some blood sucking vampire, fine. I'm the bad guy. But who's holding the fucking gun?
Wow.
What's his problem?
I've got to be honest, if my kid was dying and I couldn't get help, I don't know what I'd do.
Me, neither.
But I'd do something.
Sir!
This is Frank Grimes.
But...
The line is clipped, John. You pick up the phone, you get me.  Can I help you with something?
Where are we at with that list?
I'm working on it, John. But I need some time.
Time I don't have, Lieutenant.
I want to talk about the hostages.
What about them?
What's going on in there? How are they?
Same as they were before, Frank. We're all just kind of waiting on you.
I want you to let some of them go.
What for?
I do for you. You do for me. Show some good faith. We've got a lot of nervous people out here, John. Make everybody breathe a lot easier if we saw some happy faces.
Good faith only takes you so far. You see, I believe in the merit system. And so far, you haven't earned any points.
That's him. His name is John Archibald. His son's on the fifth floor, Pediatric ICU.
Excuse me.
I need to talk to you. Now.
 Can you hold on a minute, Frank?
This woman's six centimeters dilated and the baby is breech. I can't do anything for her here. She needs to be moved to Maternity immediately.
Put people on the door. Nobody talks to the wife but me.
Good to see you, Gus. How are you?
Hot. What's going on?
You're looking at it.
Are you there, Frank?
Yeah, I'm here.
I changed my mind. I am going to let some of the hostages go.
Great, John. That's the right thing.
But when I do, the clock starts. You have one hour to get back to me with some good news.
Isn't it a little early for you to be here, Gus? Who called in the heavy artillery?
I mean it, Frank. If my boy's not on the list in an hour, I promise you someone's going to die.
This is bad, Frank. Lot of people watching this one. Big embarrassment if it doesn't go away real quiet like.
Well, give me some time. I'm working on it.
Frank?
I got it, John. I'm hearing you. One hour.
There's no time on this one, Frank. This one's just got to go away.
You and you. Come with me. Maguire, give me a hand.
Mr. Archibald. Please let my husband go with me.
Honey, for godsakes, just do as the man says. Get out of here.
I'm not leaving you here alone.
Shit, I'll go.
Shut your face. What kind of man are you?
Screw you, Tyrone.
Julie, baby, get the gun.
Shoot him, honey. Shoot him.
You stupid bitch!
That's for beating the shit out of me.
That's for being an asshole.
And that's for calling me a bitch.
Damn.
Everybody's a tough guy.
Where are those hostages, John?
Let's go. Both of you.
What's she saying?
She said she'll pray for his boy.
Everything's going to be okay. The baby is going to be just fine.
Get out of here. Go.
Vasta. Vasta. Let's go.
The gunman has just freed several hostages who will immediately be debriefed by members of the crisis team. Will the man known as John Q. get a heart for his little boy? Time will tell. Where this leads next is anyone's guess. Live from Hope Memorial Hospital, this is Tuck Lampley.
Is it true an ambulance dropped off a gunshot victim after the gunman took over the ER?
Yes. He unlocked the door and let him in.
If he didn't, the man would have died.
John Q. very good man.
The gunman?
Si. Good man, el senor.
They've got a camera in there. I don't believe it. They're watching a video feed.
How do you know?
Well, they're looking at something, Freddy. And I need to know what it is. Can you steal it?
No problem, boss. If they got it, I can get it.
You mean all of this could have been avoided if you had just put the kid's name on a list?
Don't you dare try to blame this on me. You think Mr. Archibald is the only one with a sick child? Try the HIV ward. There's a whole floor full of them. People get sick. They die. That's the way it goes. I'm faced with tough decisions every day.
The fact is there's a man threatening to kill innocent people because you refused treatment for his son.
The fact is there are fifty million people in this country without medical insurance, sir. And there's one of me in every hospital. That's not my fault. It's just the way the country's set up. You want to change it? Write your congressman.
Excuse me, but why don't we just tell him his son's on the list? Doesn't that make sense? I mean, how's he going to know.
That's not a bad idea.
You want me to put his name on the list, fine, but it's a mistake. You give in to this man, there's going to be guns in every hospital in America.
I don't personally care if you put the kid on it or not. That's your conscience. But give us a hand, will you honey? Work with us. Tell him his kid's going to be alright. Do you think you can do that?
Sir? Sir, take a look at this.
What is it?
It's a phone.
So?
It's that phone.
So, what now? What's the plan?
Mitch...
No. I want to know. Every day you read about this kind of shit. And now we're in the middle of it. How is it going to end, John? This country, man. I swear to God. You can't go anywhere anymore without getting robbed, mugged, or murdered. Kids killing classmates, drive bys... I won't even go into a post office anymore.
Shut up, Mitch.
He's right. You know how easy it was to get this gun? One gun show. Five minutes.
That's right. You're just a punk with a gun. I understand your kid is sick, but what makes him better than me? I've got a life, too.
Yeah, but you've got insurance.
So, what, you're going to shoot me? Because that's what you're telling the cops. If poor little Mikey doesn't get the very first heart available, all of us die.
No, I don't want to cheat anyone. I just want my kid to have a fair shot.
So what's the plan, Stan? I mean, exactly? How long are you going to hold us hostage? Until your son gets a new heart?
I don't know.
Think, Einstein. Use your head. Correct me if I'm wrong, Doctor, but hearts don't come just like that. It takes months, years sometimes.
I know.
Then what's your move?
I'm not letting my kid die! I'm out of options, alright?! I have no more ideas. This is it. The end of the road. I'm looking for an act of God. I'm looking for a miracle.
No matter how many times I see it, this is the part I always hate.
Do you have any children, Miss Payne?
No. No I don't.
Mrs. Archibald?
Could we have a word with you?
This is my fault. When the hospital told me they were releasing Mikey, I was furious. I yelled at John to do something, anything. I never thought...
I understand. Is he a violent man, Mrs. Archibald.
No. Heavens, no. He's gentle. He's sweet. He wouldn't hurt a fly.
That's not what he's saying. He's talking about killing people. Has he spent any time in the military?
Hey, what is this? I get what's going on here. You want me to tell you something you can use to hurt my husband.
He's in a lot of trouble, Ma'am. We're going to need you to talk to him.
Let's get something straight, Mister. You can't use me to make a case against John. I support my husband. Whatever he does. I'm on his side. Not yours.
Mrs. Archibald...
You, don't talk to me. I'd tell you what I think of you but I'm a Christian woman. Now you people leave me alone. I have a sick child to look after.
I've decided to put Mike's name on the organ recipient list, Mrs. Archibald. The hospital will pay for everything.
Really.
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
You're good.
Excuse me?
With the Archibald woman back there. Quite a performance. The sincere look, the comforting embrace. For a minute, I almost believed you cared.
What's going on? Where is everybody?
We're sending in one of ours through the ventilation ducts.
If we can get the target to that phone, it's a clear shot.
Is that right?
Yes, Lieutenant. That is right.
On who's orders?
Gus...
Not one word. I don't want to hear one goddamn word out of you, Frank.
I'm not going to say anything. I'm just going to go get you your red nose.
What did you say to me? Are you calling me a clown?
I swear to God, I'll kill you.
You going to do this behind my back, you sonofabitch?
Check the time, Frank. Look at your watch, Frank. The guy said at a quarter after he was going to start killing everybody, and we don't have any reason not to believe him.
So goddamn stupid.
Yeah? What's your great idea?
There are no great ideas!
Right! Exactly. But right now I've got a shot at this guy. I don't even know what we're talking about. You know the score. You always take the clear shot.
The wife has agreed to speak to him. Let her talk him down.
That's exactly what we're going to do.
What? You use the man's wife to set him up?
Whatever works. Let me paint a picture for you. And I hope it's clear. What we've got is a lose/lose. If this guy starts whacking out the hostages, it's bad, right? But if we give in to this asshole, it's also bad.
Bad for who?
It's an election year. Do you want me to spell it out for you? A, B, C. However it goes down, this guy's not going to make it.
So, you kill him? That's a P.R. bonanza.
There's not going to be a slaughter in there. Not on my watch. You're out, Frank.
Out?
Out. No hard feelings. But you're officially relieved of duty. I'll handle it from here.
You?
It's not my first trip around the dance floor, you know.
Yeah.
Hey, I don't like it any better than you do, but I'm under a lot of pressure here. Everyone is wetting their pants on this one. Believe me, my ass is swinging in the breeze.
What about the hostages?
They better keep their heads down.
Where the hell are these guys?
Julie...
Leave me alone.
I'm sorry. I'm a lousy drunk, okay? I get out of control. I don't mean to, but I do and I lose my mind. But that doesn't mean I don't love you. And I'll change. I swear to God, I will. It's you and me, baby. All the girls in the club, they don't mean shit to me. It's only you. I'll get down on my knees if you want me to. Look, I'm on my knees in front of everyone. I'll even forget you kicked me in the nuts. Come on.
No, Mitch. This is always how it goes. You treat me like shit, then come crawling back to me like Prince Charming. Not this time. It's over.
Aw, come on. Don't do that. That ring cost me twenty grand.
Poor little rich boy. Used to getting everything he wants. Buying his way in and out of everything.
Do you mind? Stay away from the ring, please.
Hey, she don't want it.
yeah. Finders keepers, man.
Hey, what's so funny? Does everybody think this is a joke? You all should be thinking about your own lives, hoping that phone rings with some good news. Because in about five minutes, the road is going to get a lot narrower.
But he's not a wacko, Gus. Married with a family, no history of mental illness. No radical political views. He doesn't fit the profile.
Don't matter. You know as well as I do that anybody can fit the profile at any time.
He's got a gun and he's got hostages. That's a profile.
How long have we been doing this? You've got to trust me on this one. Gus, I like the guy.
Well I don't. I don't like nut jobs who point guns at innocent people. It pisses me off.
He's not a nut job.
Maybe you're right. Maybe he's bluffing. Maybe he's just a nice guy with a problem. Maybe he's misunderstood and needs to blow off a little steam. Hey, it's possible. But I can't depend on that, Frank. This asshole has raised the stakes real high. And I need to match it, just in case he's not bluffing. Now, we've got five minutes before he starts throwing bodies out the door. I've got a chance to end this right now and I'm taking it.
I'm telling you, you're making a mistake.
Yeah, well. We try harder.
I want to be on the record. Monroe hands Grimes a set of headphones.
You can be on whatever you want. Now I got you a chair. Put these on and have a seat.
Gus...
Will you stop already? Jesus, Frank. You're so emotional.
 This is Moody. Let's go.
Some first day, huh?
A little more stressful than I thought it would be.
What was that?
Air conditioning unit just shut off.
Yeah? Why?
The power automatically shuts down when the thermostat hits a certain temperature.
Where's my picture?
Coming. We just need to unscramble the police encryptment. We're almost there.
Well, hurry up. I've got a contact in cardiology. The cops are setting up a phone call with this guy and his wife. This is going to be unbelievable.
 Are you with a wife? Good. Let's patch it through.
Where's the phone? Which phone is it?
Come on, goddammit. They're putting the call through.
Oh, yeah. We got sound.
Good. Good. But where's the video? Come on. I need picture.
This better be good, Frank.
John?
Denise?
Hi, baby. We're on the list!
What?
Payne was just here. Mike's name is on the list. You did it.
Okay. Great. We're on the list. Wow. How's Mikey doing?
Not so good, baby. He looks like he's going away.
They've done everything they can but he keeps getting worse and worse. Oh my God, our poor baby.
Two zero to base camp. I'm in position one.
Go.
You know, sometimes I think he's an angel. A real angel, sent down to keep us company for a while.
It's going to be alright, sweetheart.
Are you praying for him? Are you praying for our boy?
Yeah, baby. I'm praying.
Oh my God, what are we going to do?
I don't know.
Maybe we should let him go. Maybe it's meant to be and we should accept it.
No. Don't say it.
I don't know what else to think. The priest keeps coming. He wants to give him last rites.
Denise, don't you lose faith now. Not you. You can't give up. Mikey's going to make it. I swear on my life, he's going to make it. You've got to believe.
Okay, baby. I'll believe.
Is he awake? Can I talk to him? INT. NEWS VAN - LATE AFTERNOON
Dad?
Are we good? Beautiful baby. You're a genius.
This is Tuck Lampley at Hope Memorial Hospital, where we are bringing you exclusive live coverage of a phone call between the father and the son he is fighting so desperately to save.
Mike? How you doing, buddy? You hanging in there?
Uh-huh. How are you?
Me? I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
How come you're not here, Dad? Where are you?
Oh, I'm kind of tied up right now. I can't get away.
Mom says I need a new heart.
That's right, champ.
What's wrong with my heart?
Not a thing, buddy. Not a thing. We just have to put a new one in so you can be stronger, okay?
Okay.
Hey, Dad?
Yeah, Mike.
Am I going to die?
No, Mikey, you're not going to die.
How do you know?
Hey, what good would the world be without you? Without you, there is no world.
Oh my God. This is the greatest thing I've ever seen. This is my white Bronco.
Hey, Mike.
Yeah, Dad?
On your call.
You know how much I love you, don't you? How proud I am of you?
Yeah.
 Take the shot.
Yeah, well, I wanted to tell you that. Just in case I forgot.
Give me a Chris Cormeir, will you? Yah!
Oh, yeah. Chris Cormeir. He's great.
What the hell. Oh, shit...
Get some rest, buddy. Okay?
Okay. I love you, Dad.
Yeah. I love you, too.
Hey, John. You're on the TV, you know that?
He's down. We got him. He's down.
Your kids are lucky, Gus. Their father's coming home tonight.
All we know at this point is that an attempt has been made on the gunman's life. Repeat. John Q. has been shot.
He's not down.
This is very bad, Gus.
Not now.
It's the Mayor, sir. And you better kill that video feed. The media's pirated the signal and the whole thing just went out live over national TV.
It's over. Mikey's not going to make it.
But the list.
What list? They're shooting at me. They're not going to help my kid. It's time to change plans.
What about an El-vad?
No.
What's an El-vad?
A left Ventricular Assist Device. It's basically a pump inserted into the chest cavity, wired to the heart to keep it stimulated.
All this time there's been a way to save his life and you never said anything?
It's not a solution. It's only a band aid. Mike's immune system may be too weak.
Will it give him time?
Not long. It's only a temporary measure.
You're going to bust me? Get real. You just shot an innocent man on primetime TV.
Grimes. Grimes!
Alright.
Alright, what?
Let's go out there. See what he wants.
But I thought you said I was out.
I stepped in shit, Frank. Is that what you want to hear, goddammit? Now quit breaking my stones. I need you to save my ass on this one.
Hold your fire.
Look what I found.
John.
Who are these guys? Who the hell are you? Oh, I know who you are, the guys who tried to take me out.
Almost.
This is Sergeant Moody and Police Chief Monroe.
What are we doing, John?
You were going to call me back. I gave you your hostages and you were supposed to call me back. But no, you want me dead.
I don't want you dead.
No, you want to kill me. You want to kill me so bad you can taste it.
Nobody wants to kill you.
Nobody wants to kill me?  Who is this?
That wasn't my call. I --
I, I, I bullshit! You tried to kill me. You tried to kill me while I was talking to my boy!
John, listen to me. Lieutenant Grimes had nothing to do with that. It was my call.
Don't lie to me. I don't need to be bullshitted by some lying flunky cops.
What are we, friends all of a sudden? All of a sudden, we owe you something? You pulled the gun. You're the one that took the hospital. What did you think would happen? You want truth Here's some truth. This is going to end up bad for you. There's only two ways out of here. Jail or dead.
Look around you. Look at all of it. It's crazy. You don't want to do this.
I just want my life back.
I understand. It's hard to be a man these days. Hard to know what the right thing is. Put the gun down, John. It's all over. You got everything you asked for. Mike is on the list. Status one.
I don't believe you.
I give you my word.
Forgive me for being skeptical, Frank, but your word is shit!
Hey, what are you doing? Stay with me, John. You think these people give a shit about you? They don't. You're just the cause of the moment. Believe me, in a couple of days, they'll be outraged about something else. Nobody cares, John. That's the real truth. Nobody cares. Only you. It's only you and me out here, and all these guns pointed at you. So, what do you want to do? It's your call.
I want my son.
What?
Bring me my son. I want my son inside with me.
Can't do it.
There's an operation that could save his life. I'm going to need some equipment but I've got two surgeons inside that are ready to go.
You listen to me, you sonofabitch. You give this up right now, turn yourself in. And your son will have any and every means of assistance. If not, if you keep this up, this is going to be very bad for you.
Are you threatening me, Chief? Take your best shot. Oh, I forgot, you already did. No, we'll do this my way. You give me my boy, they do the surgery and then I give up. Nobody gets hurt and everyone goes home.
What do you think, Frank?
I say give it to him. He's not going to hurt his boy.
Sir, the object is to get hostages out, not to let more in.
The boy is not a hostage. He's the man's son. Do it.
Mom, where are we going?
To see your father.
Coming through. Let's go. Move it back, folks.
Let me through. I'm his mother.
Dad, where have you been?
Just waiting for you, buddy.
How are you feeling, slugger?
I'm okay. Tired.
Out.
What?
I need some time to examine Mike and I don't need you getting in the way. It's crowded enough in here.
I'll stay in the corner.
I'm serious, John. Let me do my job.
Bless me, father. For I have sinned. It's been a long time, so forgive me if I'm a little rusty. I know you do things your own way. But I'm finding it hard to understand why you would want Mike to be so sick.
Are you God?
 Yeah, kid. Yeah, I am.
Where you been?
I keep waiting for you to step in and help him. But you never do. And I don't understand. I don't understand and I don't forgive. So, help me, Father. Because I'm trying. I'm really trying.
John?
Mike's blood pressure has dropped into the mid-forties. His atrial blood pressure should be in the low teens. It's thirty-five. If I put that LVAD into him, his heart will never be able to handle the extra strain.
But...
Not buts, John. Without a new heart, he's not going to make it.
Take mine.
What?
You heard me. Take my heart and put it in Mike.
John, buddy, you're talking a little nutsy cukoo, here.
You can't be serious.
You think I'm just going to stand here and watch my son die? You bet I'm serious. Dead serious.
Wow.
Oh my God.
But that means you'll die, man.
And my sone will live.
John, you can't do this.
It's the only way.
No, you don't understand. You physically can't do it.
Why not? I kill myself. You cut me open and take my heart. It's perfect.
The boy crazy.
Nutsy cuckoo, I'm telling you.
We just can't remove your heart and put it into Mike's body.
There's too many unknowns. Matching a donor and receiver is extremely complicated. There's several critical tests that have to be taken.
Like what?
Cross matches for blood type, chest cavity measurements. If both blood tissues aren't compatible, there's a very high likelihood of rejection.
Come on, Doc. I know all about compatibility. We've been tested up the wazoo. Mike and I are both B-Positive. Our tissues are a match. And his heart is three times normal size which means mine will fit. You know damn well we're compatible.
No, we don't. You're an adult. Mike is strong, but the amount of blood your heart pumps may be too much for Mike.
I'll take that chance. It's better than letting him die.
Out of the question. Too risky.
I'm telling you, he'll make it.
Can't do it, John.
You're telling me that if I'm laying dead on the floor, you wouldn't take my heart and put it in my kid to save his life? You'd let two people die instead of one because of a technicality?
I think what John's trying to do is right.
Me, too. I think it's very brave.
Yeah, it's all very noble and brave. But what do you think Mike would want? Or your wife?
Mike is too young to know what's good for him. I'm his father. It's my job to protect him, and Denise would do the same thing if she was in my place.
Are you saying Mike's life is more important than yours?
Or that it's okay that Mike grows up without a father?
You can have more children, John.
What happened to Mike is bad, man. It's the worst. It ain't fair, but you can't kill yourself. Sometimes you've just got to let go and let God take care of it. You've got to accept it.
Accept what?
That Mike's going to die.
No. I don't accept it. I reject it out of hand.
I know you only think of Mike as a patient, but he's a great kid. Really. He's like magic, you know? He loves bodybuilding. You believe that? And he's funny. You'd like him, Doc. You'd really like him, if you knew him.
I do like him.
Please. You've got to help him. I'm begging you. If you ever do anything outside the rules, do this. Take a chance, please.
I'd like to. I really would. But what you're asking crosses the line. It's completely unethical.
I've crossed the line? No, you've crossed the line. The whole system has crossed the line.
I don't think you understand. I'm not letting him die. Haven't you figured that out by now? I don't care what I have to do.
So, what, you're going to kill me if I don't operate.
No. I'm going to kill myself.
And we'll just see what happens.
Aw, man, this is messed up.
We all know how this works, people. In order for Mike to live, someone has to die. I'm the father. It might as well be me.
Alright.
Alright, what?
I'll do it. If that's what you want.
Wait a minute. Are you serious?
Once he's dead. Why not?
You're the finest surgeon I've ever known. You can't just throw your entire career for this man.
Yeah, you're not God. It's not up to you to decide who lives and dies.
Aw, come on, Mitch. We're all going to die.
Not for nothing, Doctor. But if you do this, you're finished.
So, what are they going to do? Sue me? Disbar me? Evict me from the country club?
Raymond, you're under a lot of stress. You're not yourself.
Yeah, well, what is myself? Because right now, I really don't know. Let's see --
I run six miles a day, drive around in my little black Porsche and date girls thirty years younger than me. Is the picture clear now? I like twelve hundred dollar shoes and I've always got a great tan. And here's the best part. Everybody kisses my ass and acts as if that's the way doctors are supposed to be, that's the reward. Reward for what? What I am is a plumber. I connect valves to tubes and tubes to valves. That's what I do. But back in that room with your son, I got a very short glimpse of my soul. And let me tell you, it's been long lost.
But...
This is still a hospital. There's a sick kid in there and I'm his doctor. And if there's a heart available, I'll be damned if I'm going to let it go to waste.
She's here?
Lungs?
Heart?
Type?
Come on. Blood type?
Come on, guys. Let's hurry it up. They could bust in here any minute.
This was your plan all along, wasn't it?
Last resort. You think I wanted it to turn out like this?
This is my will. I'm leaving my heart to my son.
I need two witnesses. Don't everybody jump at once.
I ain't signing your death warrant. No way.
Come on, people. The sooner we get this done, the sooner we all go home.
I'll sign.
Me, too.
You know something, man? You're alright.
Sure am. Only one thing can stop me now.
What's that.
Mitch here being B-positive.
No, sir. Type-O. Swear to God.
Hey, you.
Yeah.
Do yourself a favor. Start doing the right thing, huh? Life's too short. You had a good woman there. You're too smart to be so dumb.
Alright, people. See you in the funny papers.
Oh, my sweet Jesus.
Can I have a word with him?
Hi, Dad. You find me a heart?
Yeah, kid. We got you one. Look like you've got a guardian angel.
Try to stay awake for a minute, will you? I just need to tell you a few things. I want you always to listen to your mother. Because she's your best friend and family is important.
And girls? You're too young for them now, but when the time comes, treat them like princesses because that's what they are. And if you say you'll do something, do it, because your world should be your bond. And if you have a chance to make money, go for it, even if it means selling out once in a while. Don't be a knucklehead like your father. Everything's so much easier with money.
Don't smoke. And try to be kind. But if someone chooses you, be a man and stand up for yourself. And don't get caught up in the bad things, there's too many great things out there.
Mike?
Yeah, Dad?
See you later, buddy.
Let's do it.
Wait a minute. This gun was empty the whole time?
Aw, I'm all talk. I would never hurt any of you. Only person I ever considered killing was me.
Miss Payne! You're not going to believe this! We've got a match.
Are you sure?
B-positive. Michael William Archibald. The only status one in the whole country. The heart is ours.
Well, I'll be damned.
You really put the kid on the list?
I may be a lot of things, Lieutenant, but I am not a liar.
John. Stop. I changed my mind. I won't do this.
You're a good man, Doc. I know you'll do the right thing.
Mrs. Archibald? I have some very, very good news.
Sorry. Safety's on.
Is this for real?
You bet. The Lear Jet just landed at O'Hare. The helicopter will be here in fifteen minutes.
You want to do the honors?
 John? It's me, baby. Are you there?
John, honey? Pick up.
John? John? Oh, no.
John! It's a miracle! They found a heart! It's a miracle!!!
The heart is here. Repeat. The heart for little Mike Archibald has arrived. What an unbelievable ending to this incredible, tumultuous day.
Oh my goodness, here we go. The first of the hostages are being released. Yes, they're coming out. There's one, two. They appear to be unharmed. But certainly exhausted from what must've been an excruciating ordeal.
More, now. And there he is. John Q. is coming out.
The suspect's hands are up. He appears to be surrendering.
And they've got him. The police have subdued him. The handcuffs are on, and it's over. It's all over.
If pictures speak a thousand words, well, I'd say these images speak volumes. And now as the bloody stand off comes to an end, we remind you that Channel 8 was here first and has brought you live, moment-to-moment, all-day coverage of "Crisis at Hope Memorial.'
It's time, John.
Can you give me a second, Frank? I just need to see this thing through.
Sure. Put these on for me, will you?
Blood pressure seventy over thirty-two.
Acute respiratory distress.
He's fibrillating.
I don't have a pulse.
He's going.
No! Come on, goddammit! I'm not losing this boy!
Has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
The defendant will please rise.
The jury foreman will now read the verdict.
As to count one, Assault with a deadly weapon, we find the defendant, John Quincy Archibald, not guilty.
On count two, Armed Criminal Action. Not guilty.
On the final count, False Imprisonment, we find the defendant, guilty. The crowd erupts in protest. The media rush out to file their stories.
No!
Quiet! Sentencing will be one week from today.
He's going to do some time. But there's not a judge in the country that will give him more than a year. And with time served, John will be home very soon.
You alright?
It's okay, slugger. I'll be home soon. If you need anything, ask your mother. And Jimmy and Gina will be around.
Don't worry. If anybody messes with us, I'll take care of it.
A year, huh? I could have lost you forever. I guess I can live with that.
Time to go, John.
John? I'm proud of you.
Give 'em hell, Johnny. Don't worry about nothing.
Bye, Dad.
Not goodbye. Remember? See you later.
John Q.? Do you feel like your country has let you down?
 No. It's a wonderful country.
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you. Could you repeat that?
He said, "America is the greatest goddamn country in the world." Now excuse us, I have to take this man to jail.
John Q.! John Q.!
Look at all this. You're a celebrity, John.
Yeah? Check with me in a couple of days.
This is ridiculous. I don't even know these people.
What can I tell you? You're their hero.
I'm not hero, Frank. I'm just a regular guy.
Yeah, right.
