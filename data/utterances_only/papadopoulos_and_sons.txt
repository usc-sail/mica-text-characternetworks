Orphaned when he was just a boy, Harry Papadopoulos came to this country with nothing.
Harry was a grafter, entering the restaurant trade as a young man. That's a euphemism for 'Greek waiter' isn't it?
Only joking Harry. He then started the now famous Papadopoulos & Sons - doing all things Greek. From taramasalata to olive oil and frozen mousakas - which, I must admit, my wife and I are partial to occasionally. Not one to settle, Harry's made the move into commercial property where he's about to embark on one of the most audacious developments yet - Papadopoulos Plaza. A two million square foot redevelopment in the heart of our great city. (Applause from the audience) Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you European Entrepreneur of the Year. Harry Papadopoulos.
That's lovely. (Referring to the vase) Now just hold it up a bit for me. Yeah, that's nice. Bunch up a bit.
Just look at the camera.
A little bit more. Perfect. Now touch the vase for me, if you don't mind.
Touch it? What a perv.
Katie. You're the p... p... perv.
And you're the f.. f.. freak.
Shush.
Come on guys. Big smiles. Big smiles for me.
Did you really work in a restaurant Daddy?
A long time ago. Touch it.
Guys. This is supposed to be a celebration. What's the Greek word? Is it Opa? Opa?
Touch the vase.
Cheese!!! CUT TO:
Congratulations from the Prime Minister. Sir Derek Otterly was there today Mrs Parrington.
I don't know him.
Sir Derek? You must remember him. He's been to the house.
They all blur.
That's because they're all so dull.
Weird. Gold doing well. Tech stocks down.
Nice one Mrs P.
Oh, thanks Dave. Would you like to stay for some supper?
Oh no. Best not. Got some dinner at home. That's a nice vase, isn't it?
European Entrepreneur of the Year.
That's impressive.
Dave. Did you g.. g.. get my cuttings?
I did mate. It's in the greenhouse. I got you a Caryopteris and a Philadelphus. JAMES Cheers man. Thank you.
See you later.
See you tomorrow.
Daddy? What did Papadopoulos & Sons borrow for the property development?
About three hundred million.
Never mind the trials and tribulations of the stock market. Finish your supper young man.
Nanny P!
Eat up or there'll be no pudding. I've made you a nice sponge.
Two, Four, Eight, 16...
Alright.
Thirty two, sixty four, 128..
That's enough.
Something is happening with interbank lending Daddy!
Alright. We'll talk about it tomorrow.
It's going to be a long summer.
Taking them to a business awards ceremony is hardly a family day out. My suggestion was a cottage in Lyme Regis.
Dave? I need to talk to you about James. It's... Look, you really should be doing that at the back. 
Yeah. Sorry.
Look. Its. He needs to complete his degree. And this gardening, the horticulture, the plants.
Yeah, yeah.
It's a huge distraction.
I was just helping him out during the holidays.
Well, I need him to complete his studies and you're diverting his attention. And frankly, it's not what I pay you for.
Please don't be so churlish. You know, if you were worked for my company you'd probably be fired.
Yeah. Is there anything else?
No. That's it. DAVE Goodnight Mr. Papadopoulos.
James.
W...
Relax.
Wa... wa...
Calm down.
Wa.. wa..
You need to learn how to... You really need to learn how to express yourself more calmly.
Wanker.  Wanker.
James? Can I come in?
It is not the strongest to survive, nor the most intelligent but those adaptable to change. Fascinating. Charles Darwin. (Latching onto a random plant) Ah. Look at that. And that's...
Did you know, that the average garden contains over three and a half million species?
No, I didn't.
Dad. I'm not going back to...
But it's only a year and then you've got a law degree.
I've no intention of running P.. P.. Papadopoulos & Sons. I can't even pronounce it.
Look. Finish your studies. The plants. It's a hobby. Sure. Give yourself options. You may change your mind about the business. You know, there are a lot of creative roles now in business.
Like what?
Like marketing. Alright. Defer the final year. Take a year out, why not? Fine. But don't quit. Your mother would have said the same.
Would she?
Well, your mother would probably have said do what you feel was right but I'd argue she was wrong. And then we'd argue. Probably. And she'd win. That was your mother. At least consider deferring. JAMES thinks about it.
Okay. I'll consider deferring.
Yeah? Great. Great. So, there you are, it's not a definitely not?
What's this one called?
It's an ivy.
Mrs P! Mrs P! Look, I'd better.
Hey. Well done. For. You know.
Closed?
Yes please.
Evening boss. Sorry to disturb. I work for a homeless charity.
Sorry. No thanks.
New dish cloths? HARRY I know how you people operate.
I got a badge.
No mention of a charity.
Come on boss. Give us a break. I'm trying to earn a living here. Look. Got tea towels, surface cleaners, scrubbers, brushes, window sprays, shammies - for drying the car. Cars.
Daddy. You need to see the news! 
Hello there mini boss.
Who's that man?
He's a... he's a... he. He works for a charity.
Is it a cake sale?
Cakes? Did you say cakes? Did he say cakes? How do you know? That's what I want to do. Open up a cake shop.
Cakes? Really.
Cup cakes, individually decorated gingerbread men, bite-sized apple strudels, gooey fudge balls, mini- muffins as well as your traditional fare. Got a business plan and everything. It'll be egalitarian but feel exclusive - sort of my mission statement really. The Progressive People's Cake Shop. With... progressive pricing.
That's very good. I know a thing or two about the food business as well. DOOR KNOCKER Really? I'm looking for investors.
Retail's not for me, I'm afraid. Staff. Nightmare. They'll nick your cakes, upset your customers, then do you for wrongful dismissal.
Oh. Thanks for the encouragement.
Let's buy something. The news Daddy!
Well, how much for...
It's a shammy.
Whatever. How much?
The shammy. It's a shammy.
I'm not going to say that word.
Why not?
Because it's a silly word and I don't know what it's for and I don't know if you're genuine. And I'll probably never use it.
Oh. A shammy.
Come look Daddy.
Turn it up. THEO points the remote and turns up the volume.
Panic confusion and chaos. They said it couldn't happen again but today it just did sending shock waves through the world's markets.
What's going on?
Another bank collapse.
Nicholas. I'm watching now. It's insane. I don't know. Why don't you call them? Alright. I'll see you first thing tomorrow. Bye.
Will this have repercussions on your loan?
That's a very good word Theo. Isn't it? Daddy? Repercussions.  It's a good word.
Oh yes. Sorry. Yes. It's a very good word.
They've revalued the property. They're calling in the guarantees. You need to find thirty mil now. Six months to find the rest.
And if we don't? What happens?
They'll put you and everything you own into administration. Harry. You took out crazy loans. Our business is making feta cheese for God's sake.
Nick. 
You gambled it on a shopping mall.
I could do without these comments right now.
I'm the finance director of this company Harry. You never listened. Never. It always had to be bigger, better. Like these offices. We didn't need these offices. Do you know how much we paid for that 'work of art ' up there? Do you? Two hundred grand. For a fish.
What do you want me to do Nick?
Our business was profitable Harry. I was going to retire in two years. I'd like to bring that forward.
You're resigning? Now? The accountants coming in.
Sorry Harry. En boro. En boro.
HARRY Nicholas!
That's enough. That's enough.
Nicholas. Can you believe that?
Shit, fan and hitting? Hey! Fat Laki! You know why they call this guy Fat Laki?
Wow. Congratulations.
I stopped eating bread. It's sad though. I loved bread. But. What can you do?
This is Sophie. Just relocated from our New York office.
Hello. Really pleased to meet you. Can I just say, I'm a huge fan of Greek food. Especially the cakes. I love Baklava.
Great. The ship's going down and we've got baklava.
I take it the banks are pulling the rug? What are the bastards proposing?
They've demanded the 300 million we borrowed. Thirty by close of play.
Sweet mother of God. They are sons of bitches.
They've taken a new position on the value of the property development. It's triggered the guarantees. SOPHIE Can you sell it?
It's not even a building site yet.
So, its bankruptcy.
Put something offshore, I said. He wanted to pay his taxes.
Maybe I should have been more Greek about it.
Hey. It's bankruptcy baby. Not disaster.
Accountants. When it's good, they get paid. When it's bad, they get paid. I want my son to be a lawyer for the same reason. He doesn't get it. So what are the options?
Well, the obvious is to buy back your own business.
Trick is finding the investors to back you.
And the banks will sell back to me because?
Because nobody makes pink slop like you do Harry.
The banks just want a quick sale. They have no interest in running your business.
Let's jump on it.
I'll talk to private equity firms, VCs, angels. The usual suspects. We'll find someone. SOPHIE What doesn't break you, makes you.
Ah. Therapy. Don't charge me for that, will you? Rob? Don't let her charge me for that.
They're going through my things. It's disgusting.
Are they darling. It's temporary. You'll get it all back.
Morning.
Oh. Hi.
Problem.
This is the... kitchen.
Fabulous finishes.
So how long's this going to take?
Most of the day, I should think.
And what are we allowed to keep?
Ah, well. According to the asset sheet... let's see. Not very much.
Little rats, with their little claws.
That is quite unnecessary Katie.
We may as well do this now. That's a nice computer. Oh, don't worry we're not going to, you know, take it... now. Anything interesting?
Stocks. Everyone's selling. I'm buying. Two, Four, Eight, 16, 32..
Double your numbers quietly Theo and apologise or I'll confiscate that wretched computer for a week.
Sorry.
There's no easy way of doing this. NIGEL You have impeccable taste, by the way.
It's not mine.
We operate very strict guidelines.
We have your range of Greek dips at home. Don't we Rupert?
As I was saying, we operate very strict guidelines.
So. What is legally ours?
Well, the bank will let you keep 25,000 in cash. And you're each allowed 1,000 in personal items.
My Westwood Gold Label cost more than that.
It's such a beautiful dress. I couldn't resist looking.
I love it too.
I'll sort something out for you.
Thank you!
Nigel.
You seem like such a lovely family. We hate doing this.
Nigel.
Right, so 25k cash. And 1000 in personal items. What else? RUPERT Ah. Well. One thing that came up in the meeting with HQ this morning. The fish and chip shop. The Three Brothers?
What fish and chip shop?
That went years ago.
Well, the bank is unable to seize it as an asset because of its co- ownership with a... Spiros Papadopoulos?
Right.
Yes, that's his brother. But they haven't spoken in years.
It was so strange. Oh, James - more lemon son.
Oh. This is so good Mrs P. In all the years, I never stopped thinking about you or your food.
Still so charming.
So, I'm sitting there watching the telly and suddenly I see Papadopoulos & Sons. On the TV.
Daddy over leveraged himself. SPIROS Look at this little Englezo. Hey! I'm your Uncle Spiros re. I'm your uncle, re manga! I'm going to eat him he's so cute.
Please don't eat me.
Re gugluthi. He's just like his mother. A little Englishman.
That's because my Mummy was English.
Ah! I know re! I know. Ah. So! I'm watching the news and I'm thinking, what's my baby brother gone and done now? And just at that moment.  
She's still a little spoilt.
Nanny P!
And dumpy.
Not so dumpy.
Ah, James. Sweet baby James. When you were three. How old was he? Three or four? We used to play fight. Remember? You loved to fight. Why, you broke my nose. Yeah! Fuck that hurt!
Spiros.
Oh. Sorry.  Duck! I said duck. . THEO I know what you said.
Don't tell your father. Harry. Thank you for phoning me. No, seriously. I'm so grateful. There's, you know... I know there's so much that we need to sort out, you and I.
Well.
But we should be celebrating. Yeah? I don't drink anymore. Just so you know. But you don't have to be drunk to dance. That's what I say now. You don't have to be drunk to dance!
Fantastic. So. Look. We're losing the house and well everything. It's only temporary. I'm in negotiations with a top corporate finance team to buy it back. But in the meantime, I need to free up some capital.
I'll give you whatever I've got but you know, I don't have much money.
I don't want your money Spiro. I want to sell the Three Brothers. We'll split it 50/50. I get enough money pay the rent, pay a few bills off and it's great for you because you get some cash to do whatever it is you want to do.
You can't sell the Three Brothers.
I knew it! I knew you'd be difficult. I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. You haven't changed.
No, it doesn't feel right.
You're loving this.
No Harry. I want to help.
Can't you see we're in the shit?
Gentlemen, please. May I suggest we sleep on this? Before it gets out of hand.
Yeah. This is good advice Mrs P.
Harry? Harry?
Okay. Whatever.
I couldn't sleep last night. Not a wink. Over and over, in my mind, I was trying to imagine selling the shop. Something here was saying, no, no. I want to help you. All of you. So I prayed for guidance. I asked the Universe. Please help me. Please help me help these people. And I must've fallen asleep not long after. A crazy sleep. And then this dream. Banayia mou. There was this, this music. The most incredible music. And you and me Harry. Running the shop. I woke with tears in my eyes and I knew.
Sorry. What are you going on about?
We are going to reopen the Three Brothers.
Brilliant! KATIE Is he talking about us?
Yeah, I think he is.
There's nothing there.
Exactly. It's empty. Useless. We'd get nothing for it. But if we made the Three Brothers great again. Hey! That is our destiny! Okay. It needs work. Sure. But destiny need work.
You're still crazy.
We have. You. You have a better chance of getting through this if we increase the value of the shop.
I'm not opening a fish and chip shop, I'm Papadopoulos & Sons, I'm on supermarket shelves.
God. What would I tell my friends?
Don't know, maybe the truth?
I don't know, maybe the truth.
God. Fuck off.
F.. f.. fuck you.
Enough!
People! Hear me out. If we get it up and running again, we can sell it as a going concern instead of an empty shop. This deal you're working on could take ages. In the meantime, you're getting cash in and you're saving money because it's got two bedrooms. Eh? The Three Brothers is a goldmine. Used to be. Can be again.
When did you become so practical?
I'll get it fixed. I'm a handyman now.
I thought you were a waiter Spiros.
Around too much booze Mrs P. I went travelling. Belgium, America, Brooklyn. I ended up managing a block of apartments in LA. I do painting, decorating, plumbing, electrics, everything.
A man who can fix things.
I've got a van.
Oh. It's alright everyone. Don't panic. He's got a van.
Let's go look at the shop. Let me go and start working on it now.
You're out of your mind. I know what you're up to. You want to make some money for yourself. That's fine. It's okay. It's okay. At least you're thinking smart these days. But don't involve us in all this.
I want to help.
Given the current situation, I think it's worth consideration.
What? I'm not opening a fish and chip shop. I'm not. I'm not! I'm not! I'm not! Not! Not! What?
May I have a private word? Now.
You're behaving like a child.
Mrs Parrington, with all due respect...
You are the father of this family.
I'd rather boil my own head than go back to a chip shop.
What a terrible thing to say. Really. 
He's unreliable Mrs P. He's irresponsible, he's a talker. He sings. He dances. He plays the bongo drums. He's a waiter. He'll drive us all mad and leave us broke.
He seems reformed to me. He doesn't drink anymore. I think he wants to help.
Moving back to a chip shop will destroy my children's confidence.
Seeing you behave like a spoilt brat will do that perfectly well.
We're going to smell of fish and chips.
The children need a home. I don't give a fig for your bourgeois snobbery. Look at you. Everything has to be a drama with you Greeks. Show some gumption man.
So many memories.
Are we really going to live in that?
Oh.
I'm trying to find something good.
And?
No. Nothing.
Nonsense. You'll love it! We're going to have a crazy time. We're going to fix this place up. I'm going to teach you how to do some Greek dancing, some singing. We'll fry some good fish. We'll laugh. Good times.
I don't believe it.
What? HASSAN The Greeks are back.
What Greeks?
Those Greeks. Hello my old friends. Mehmet. Find out what they're up to.
See. It looks much worse from the outside.
It's actually a fish and chip shop.
Of course it is you spanner.
Daddy. Really?
What's this?
This is Mr Charles. Our lucky fish. He helped us make the busiest chip shop in London.
I can smell the past. Your father and I. Young. The women. Young. Making good money.
Wasting it. Gambling it. Losing it.
Happy days. KATIE It's a crack den!
Don't worry. Let me show you the rest. We'll make it homely. Furniture, beds, TV. Come on. Let me show you. So... here is the prep room...
Mortimer Rolf and Jones? 
Hello. Could I speak to Rob.
He's not at his desk. Can I take a message?
It's Harry Papadopoulos.
Oh hi. It's Sophie. We met at your office, the other day.
Oh hi. Any news?
We're lining up interest.
Right. Well, I just need to know... I need to know if this is going to work.
Rest assured. We'll be driving the herd to Abilene.
Sorry.
It's an old American, Mid-West expression.  Are you okay Mr. Papadopoulos? HARRY Yep, all good. Just keep me informed please.
Of course.
Harry Papadopoulos called. You should call him back.
Let's go out, yeah. Let's celebrate. Let's find... I don't know... Let's find a... salsa club or something.
Sorry?
Daddy just put another pig in da bag. Owch! A new instruction. Wallinghams. Big UK retail chain. Established. Leave it... Leave it to Wallinghams... Comfortably, elegantly, reliably. Wallinghams. Croydon, Greenwich, Enfield, Wimbledon and... Ding! Going into administration. Coming to little old moi for services rendered. Thank you. Oh thank you very much. God I love an economic downturn. Joking aside though. Five thousand laid off. Sad. Very, very sad. But dear sweet mother of God it was a shit business.
Happy days.
Oh yeah. Hallelujah! (He goes to exit) Six?
Two, four, eight, sixteen... Two, four, eight...
Daddy, come at look at this giant mushroom I've found.
Coming.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey. Remember up here? We used to bring out the tables and chairs with the other Greeks.  
Did my Daddy dance?
Yeah. I taught him. And your mother.
My Mummy?
Hey. Manga. This is the place where your Mummy and Daddy met.
What? Up here?
Yeah. They talked all night. They danced. Yeah, there was a lot of dancing here. Hey. You want me to show you? How about it?
Spiros please. It's not a holiday. Just show everyone around.
What?  I'll show you later. You alright?
Yeah. No, I like the view. I might put some plants up here.
Hello.
Hi.
Do you have a light? 
You came all this way for a light?
I'm from the kebab shop across the road.
Nice.
My Dad wants me to spy on you. I don't think he like Greeks. You want to go out sometime?
Yeah, alright.
I'm Mehmet.
It's Katie.  It's shit here, isn't it?
Yeah. Pretty much. Yeah. Catch you later.
Yeah. Bye. MEHMET walks back to his shop. KATIE smiles. Music - Athina, Athina by The Trio Attico . HARRY steps outside the shop. He looks at KATIE who is still smoking. He stands there for a moment looking a little lost. He gets into SPIROS' van and drives away.
Mortimer, Rolf and Jones. Oh hi Dad. Yeah, I got them. They're beautiful. Thank you. Alright. Put her on.
He's here.
Right. Just a second. Hi mom. Thanks for the flowers, they're lovely. There was nothing wrong with New York. Yes, you can stay friends with Matt. And Bill and Susan. Mom, look, I've got a meeting. I don't know. Some meeting. Yeah, I promise, I will. I love you. Okay, bye. Bye.
Parents. Is Matt your...
Ex.
Right. A bit of a tosser, yeah?
I wouldn't say tosser exactly. We just wanted different things.
Yada, yada, yada. Yeah, I hear ya. It's like me and my ex. She was keen and everything but I don't know, her forward thinking sort of killed the romance. Yeah. It's good to have these little chats. Shouldn't always be about work. Society is so work obsessed. Tragic. Right. Back to work.
Some big names.
Pap & Sons is still a cash cow. 
What's the potential deal structure?
That's the pisser.
You'd still be key to running the business, but...
But?
Money isn't cheap Harry. These guys will want at least 95% of the company.
Leaving me with nothing. I'd do the same thing. I'd be CEO of Papadopoulos & Sons. Get a salary. Get my house back. My children's future.
It beats fish and chips.
You'd be working for someone else.
I'd be working for someone else. By the way, I'm not actually running a fish and chip shop. Just helping my brother relaunch. ROB Sure. Listen, there maybe another way. Came up in conversation with the Norske Velconan Bank. It'd be along the lines of a straight loan to buy back the business.
Why would they lend me the money?
Well. Let's ask them. Want me to look into it?
Sure, no choice.
Okay. Cool. Got to go. Got an emergency with - get this - a high tech portable toilet company - that has literally gone down the tubes.  An internet ready, wireless, crapper with a waterproof keyboard and screen. For the love of God. Because taking a dump needed an overhaul. Still, somebody's got to bury them. Inomine patre, Spiritu, Sanctu... etc, etc.
Got to love a downturn.
Laters.
I think what you're currently doing with your brother sounds liberating.
I'm liberating myself of my last 25 grand on a disused chip shop.
But its like a startup. Isn't that the most exciting phase of any venture? Taking a bit of a risk. Developing your products and your services. Learning about your market. Look, some of the largest companies on the planet never make a profit. Like a real profit. It's all accounting tricks and leveraged debt. What I'm trying to say is, does it matter if the business is a small one? As long as it makes a profit and the people who work there are happy?
What are you doing working in a place like this?
This is only temporary. I got divorced recently. Came to London for a fresh start. I'm actually looking into setting up my own business.
Well, I'm sorry about that. About the divorce, I mean. Not...
I've been meaning to ask. Can I come and visit your shop sometime?
There isn't one.
When it's up and running.
It's a chip shop. It's hot. On your feet all hours. Verbal abuse from customers on a Friday night.
I wasn't applying for a job Harry. Just wanted to stop by.
It's late. What are you doing little man?
Trading. I watch trends. Making trades based on patterns. I don't even look at the fundamentals. SPIROS The fundamentals?
You know, capital employed, gearing ratios etc. Not even turnover or profit. It's short term, but I can spot a trend. I know what's going to happen.
So, you can see the future? And?
Same as the past. The pursuit of order from chaos. I'm done for today.
Ah! Theo, Theo, Theo. Guglouthi mou. Kali Nichta. Onira ylica. Sweet dreams.
Uncle Spiros? You knew my Mummy.
Yes. She was... She was beautiful. And she was very kind to me.
I wish I had my Mummy sometimes.
It's very hard for you.
I'd have made her laugh, Uncle Spiro.
You make me laugh.
I've come out with some classics. Real gems. Wasted on this family.
Ha! You are something else.
We can hear everything..
Don't fall for him Spiros. He's a little tinker.
Say the magic release poem!
No.
Actually, say it the magic release poem.
No...
Theo Papadopoulos is a hippopotamus, who's always making such a fuss from his top to bottomus!!!
Ah, your kids are something else.
Don't worry. I'm not too religious. I'm a lapsed Buddhist. I do everything a good Buddhist does except abstinence.
Ear plugs.
Oi re. This is a fantastic thing. Did you ever imagine, 30 years ago? Back here? HARRY No.
Remember how excited we felt when we got this place? It feels like that again. Hey. My gut says... push Alaskan Pollock. Over Cod! What do you think?
I should never have taken out that loan.
Ah. We'll talk fish after we fix this place.  We'll talk fish after we fix this place. Katie's got some good thoughts. Says we should keep the old look. And she had some beautiful ideas about the uniforms. 
But then, you know. The potential yield of the Plaza. Papadopoulos Plaza. Fully developed with a thousand year lease. I would have kept the freehold. I'm telling you Spiro. It was good. I'd have been worth a fortune. Worth, I don't know. One billion five. One billion six. One billion six. Big numbers Spiro. Big, big numbers.
We were children when we came to the UK with nothing. We start again. Fat Laki. The weight you lost is an inspiration. Phil The Till. You've helped many Greeks with your tax friendly till machines. Eh, only two things are certain in life - death and taxes. Unless you're Greek. Then it's only death! . Nikos, Kyriaco, Androniki, Loula, Uncle Panikos, Aphrodite, Maria and of course, Father Jimmy. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Didn't Father Jimmy get done for selling illegal copies of Rambo?
He's got three liquor stores in Palmers Green.
He always hated me.
People. Hello. Sorry. Hi. I just want you to know this is a temporary situation for the family. I'm currently in negotiations with a top corporate finance team about re- acquiring the assets of Papadopoulos & Sons. That's it.
What did he say?
Tragic.
James, music.
Thank you. I officially announce the renovation of the Three Brothers.
You're supposed to do that after you launch something.
To hell with convention. SPIROS smashes the bottle on the floor and rallies the assembled party who cheer 'bravo' and clap.
Hade re Laki. Tell us.
Entaxi. Don't rush me. Its been a long time since I had meat like this.
What's he doing?
He's assessing the competition.
E belame mas (He's driving us crazy).
There's a reason Hassan's still in business. Texture, very good. Way above average. Meat content. High. Mechanically recovered cheap rubbish? You wish. This is a quality donner, nicely cooked with all the right combination of herbs. It's beautiful.
It doesn't mean we can't take them on.
No. I'm not saying we can't.
Yes?
Sorry. I... I...
What do you want?
That's a lot of Greeks.
What? We're going out.
Not too late.
Well, she is 18.
We'll make a better product at a cheaper price with larger portions. We'll lose money on the kebabs in the short term, put Turks out of business within a year, make our margins on the fish and when the rest of this crummy street has packed up we'll raise our prices and cut our portion sizes.
The entrepreneur has spoken.
Hey, it's temporary, but as long as we're here we'll do some business.
You know, when he was a little boy, he'd come home from school and sit there - just like that.
Who was the third b.. brother?
Michael. He died in the fire. With our parents, your grandparents, in Cyprus. In the war between the Greeks and Turks.
How did you both escape?
Spiros climbed down and Michael who was... six?
Yeah.
Dropped me down. I was just a baby.
I caught him. But Michael... He. I told Mihalis to jump. But he... he ran right back into the house. We'll never know why. One night and everything changes.
He probably wanted to save his Mum and Dad.
You know what? I never thought about that. You could be right. Yeah. You are a wise boy James. Your soul is old. Tell me. This has always been a big question for me. For many years. Do you think... do you think... I could've done something else? For Michael?
No. You were holding a baby.
Yeah.
And how old were you?
I was nine.
Well, you were only a boy. Like Theo.
H? Hello? What's wrong with him? Hey. Don't worry. It's temporary!
Excuse me.
Did I say something wrong?
He was only nine. I never thought about how young he was.
I got you this. Tea.
James. Come here. Sit down. I've let you and your brother and your sister down.
Dad.
I made a promise to your mother that I'd take care of you.
And you're doing that.
This is humiliating for you.
Dad, we'll get through this. Like... I don't know. Like King Lear.
I don't know the story.
Well, King Lear loses everything. Absolutely everything and he finds himself in the middle of this storm with nothing and all his kids h.. h.. hate him. They think he's a prick.
What happens to him?
Well. He dies.
Oh.
But it has to end like that because its a tragedy.
I'm sorry about your plants.
I can grow new ones.
Why didn't you bring more with you?
I didn't want to get in the way.
You're such a sweet boy. You get that from your mother. Your stammer is getting better. You know what? I'm going to go and get your plants. Now. From the house.
What? Right now?
I'm going to get your plants. Like King Lear. Yes?
Er. Yeah. Sort of.
Daddy!
Hello. What's going on?
We're making b.. batter.
Uncle Spiros' special mix.
That's all I could find.
Thank you.
It's very late.
I said they could help.
It is the holidays.
It doesn't sound very good.
Hey. You can stay up. It's the holidays. Tomorrow, we'll look through the newspapers and pick out some stocks. How does that grab you?
Natural resources is a good buy.
Hey, wait. Show us your frying skills.
I was telling them how you were born with a timer in your head. How you fried to perfection every time.
Not tonight.
Come on Dad, show us how to fillet a fish.
Go on Daddy.
Yes H. Come on. Show us. Show us. Show us! Show us!
You should really be thinking about bed, all of you. Good night.
Bed?
Alright, that's it. Where we going?
City. Get a loan. Get the business back, get the house back. Does this suit look alright?
Yeah. It's a suit. 
It doesn't. I don't know. It doesn't fit.
I don't believe it. They're kissing.
Ah. Kids. Come on.
In the street?
They're smoking. They're hanging out.
Are they? Are they?
What?
Are they screwing?
No. They're just kissing.
I've got to get out of this place.
Come on. He's a sweet guy. HARRY Out! The family is in the gutter.
You're overreacting Harry.
The thought of her pregnant. In a kebab shop.
Harry. Don't worry about Katie. She can look after herself.
What are you doing?
I've got something to say.
About Katie? Is she pregnant?
No.
Oh God. Have you've got cancer?
No.
Just bear with me. So. Here goes. After years of abuse on my behalf and unacceptable behavior, I reached a moment of clarity - actually this was two years ago.  I'd like to apologise for the hurt I've caused.
What now?
There were aspects of my behaviour which were unacceptable. This includes, and is not limited to.
Why now?
I've been carrying this. Well, if you don't want to hear we can do it later.
No. Now is fine. Now is good.
Just. (Reading note paper and turning over pages) Oxi. Oxi. Skip that.  I have abused your generosity.
I agree with that statement.
When we were children and got to London I looked after you. Got you ready for school. Made you do your homework. I taught you to cook, ride a bike, speak Greek. Dance.  Why don't you speak Greek re?
You were reading your list.
I fought with Stephen Klein, when he accused you of stealing his orthopedic shoe. Remember that?
Yeah.
Did you take it?
No.
You can tell me now. HARRY I didn't steal the shoe. Are you going to read all of that?
I don't have to.
Why did it go wrong with us Spiro? We may as well get to it. Why did you turn against me after I left the shop?
I never turned against you.
That's what it felt like.
I was jealous of you.
You were my brother.
Brothers get jealous.
You were more than a brother.
You were my life and then you left. Gone.
I set up the business. I wasn't going to stay in the shop. You could've come with me.
Harry, you were so fast. You were like a plane, like a supersonic jet.
But I gave you everything you wanted. Did I ever once turn you down? In all the years after I left the business. Did I? And after it went bust? But it was never enough. Every week something new. Writing a cheque to... I don't know. You had some weird friends. Who was that bloke with the pin head? Kept turning up at the house.
None of my friends anymore.
And then drunk at Elizabeth's funeral? And your big 'tell it as it is' speech.
I heard about it.
That was it for me. For us.
You were right to cut me off.
She never had a bad word for you Elizabeth. Always forgave you. And she made me forgive you. Every time.
She did. I always had a way back when she was with us. Elizabeth was so good to me. She was our world. She was our world.
I'm sorry, I can't.
It's okay H.
I've got to get to this meeting. It's an important meeting.
It's okay to miss her.
Oh man.  Just give me a minute.
With the help of Lars and the Norske Velconan Bank, we aim to buy Pap and Sons back from the receivers.
Also, I have to say Harry that I believe there is an intuitive bond between the Greek and the Nordic peoples, yah? And so, maybe the very first vikings were descended from Ancient Greeks, somewhere in the deep mists of time. And so it's so... so Wagnerian, yah? 
We should point out the new approach.
To buy Papadopoulos & Sons but divest the food manufacturing side of the business.
Divest the food manufacturing? What else is there?
Sell off the food but keep the property.
Papadopoulos Plaza. It's going to be worth a fortune.
That's not what I had in mind.
It's an asset breakup.
Tusk. Tusk, yah? Makes us sound like barbarians.
With the new loan, you'd buy back your old assets and then sell off the brands in the Pap & Sons stable.
Yah. And you know how to squeeze the value Harry.
That's a break up.
Please. I know what it is.
The pitta bread, the cakes get sold to a bakery.
The halloumi and feta to a dairy company.
I love your halloumi! Grilled. It's... 
The sell off value of these brands will exceed the new loan.
So my bank will get its money back faster than you can say 'knife'.
And what do you get?
Lars wants 50% of the Plaza development. Which is what will remain after the debts have been settled.
So you get 50% of the development for free.
Sure, yeah. But you get 50% of the same development yah, also for free.
What do you want Harry?
I want my food business back.
Guy,   guys, guys. Reality check. Harry. It's   not going to happen. Okay? The best   you can hope for is to work with Lars   here and save something. HARRY I can't say no.
Okay. So. Yah. I need to take this to the board. Take two, three months. But pish, yah?
It seems criminal to buy the business back only to break it up.
Can I just point out that you are skating. Figuratively speaking. On thin fucking ice.
I'll do whatever the bank wants. 
Okay! Harry, we are going to take this to the hoop, yah? Three points! Yah? Three points!
Taking out a loan to pay off a loan? So you can remortgage a property? It's got nothing to do with business. It's got nothing to do with making stuff.
I get my life back.
No. You get a loan for some land.
My children get their lives back.
I'm sorry. This isn't very professional.
Do you give all your clients a hard time Sophie?
No. Just the interesting ones. HARRY You got five minutes?
Yeah. Of course.
Just want to talk about the shop and make sure my brother's got the right plan before I go.
Okay. Let's grab a coffee.
So it's 30% on materials. The fish, the potatoes, the packaging etc. Would you include energy? Light, heat?
Yeah. But not rent because we already own the building.
Okay. And 30% on labour?
Yeah.
So it's 30/30/30. Classic restaurant model.
That's right.
What are your weaknesses?
The price of fish can vary. Dramatically.
Can you vary the menu?
You don't want to complicate it.
It doesn't have to be complicated Harry.  What are your fears?
My fears? Oh. Just that it just won't work out. That fish and chips has maybe had its day.
No. Hang on a second. Fish and chips is a British classic. It's much more than just a quick meaningless experience. It's something to be savoured. Just think of the soft, white, cod flakes, gently falling away as your fork pierces the hard, crunchy shell of the golden batter. The rich smells of a fryer's delight. The tangy smack of salt and vinegar on your lips. Hell yeah. I'd pay for that.  
Yes. We should
What?
This time last year I was in Malibu.
We'll go tonight.
It's not a nightclub. It's America.
Oh. Look. The shop's where I'm from but it's not where I'm going to end up.
My Dad must've said that to my Mum once. Maybe even on this bridge.
See. Look where he ended up?
So, what's your plan?
Property. Got an eye for it.
I'll probably be a pop star one day.
Cool.
Yo, yo, yo! It's time to die... Yo, yo, blue bottle fly...  
That is well sick!
Yeah. I wrote something for you too. It's a poem. It's called, 'Sometimes I want for nothing else'. Just you and me. In an ever expanding Universe. Sharing a cup of tea. Sometimes, I want for nothing else.
Fuck. You're amazing.
Lovely. Come and try. Fresh fish. Lovely hot chips. Come and try. Little boy. Battered inside. Special chip for you? And one for you. Fish and chips, come and try. We batter our own fish.
Sir, have a chip. Have a fish. No. None for you. Try, come and try.
It's not just fish and chips.
There's room for all of us.
What do you want Hassan?
Remember when we were children? When we were friends. We weren't Greeks, Turks. Respectfully, I would like you to take your kebabs off the menu. This is a fish and chip shop.
What do we get?
I won't do fish.
You don't do fish Hassan. HASSAN You are going to put us on the street.
It's business.
It's not about business. Perhaps you would not be like this if we were Greeks.
I'll tell you what. We'll take kebabs off the menu, if you ask your son to stay away from my daughter.
More tea?
No. Thank you. This is very difficult.
Come on. It's easy.
My son is his own man.
Right. There's no deal.
Is this because he's Turkish? Because he's a Muslim?
Oh no. I don't have a problem with that.
Harry's not like that.
Because he works in a kebab shop? Is that it?
Yeah. Harry's more like that.
I would ask you - both of you - to respect a man's aspiration for his daughter. HASSAN I have similar aspirations for my son. Spiro, perhaps you should remind your brother where he is now. Tell him to look around. Perhaps he still sees a big mansion with gardens and servants. Well, I don't. But more importantly, neither does my son.
This is only. We'll be gone in a couple of months.
I hope so. It's going to be a very long couple of months.
For both of us.
Say cheese!
So, here we are.
Here we are. MRS PARRINGTON I'm sure it will be good news.
If it's good news Spiro, I want you to have the shop. All of it.
Will we get to visit Uncle Spiros again?
Yes, of course we will.
Who's going to help me to run the store? I'm going to need you little man.
I expect Uncle Spiros will always find you a holiday job here. 
Hello. Lars. Yeah. I'm just...
What is it?
Did you get the loan?
Bad news I'm afraid.
Really?
Yeah. We're going home! We got it! We're going home.
Congratulations.
What's wrong? We're leaving, we're out of here. We got the loan. We should be celebrating.
He's right. It's a good day. You, you made it. You're a survivor. Sorry.
What is it with you Spiro? Why can't you be happy for me? Whenever I have any kind success you always have to stamp on it.  Where are you going?
I am happy for you. I am.
What is it? What's wrong?
There is this...
He looks dead to me.
No, he's not dead. He's sleeping. He's still sleeping.
Like sleeping beauty?
Yes. That's a good way of looking at it.
Sorry. I hope I'm not.
No, no. Come in. (Indicating to James to get a chair) James, James. And take the erm... (Refering to cake) SOPHIE Yeah, I heard the news and I really wanted to bake something so I made a Greek Easter cake. Don't ask.
No. That's really... lovely. Thank you very much. We'll, we'll have some of that. He's in a mild coma apparently and we have to talk to him and play music and... James, put the... turn the music on. (To SPIROS) Hey, wake up. The accountant's here. You've got to wake up.
James! 
Jesus Christ!
Katie!
Sorry. It won't turn off.
You're such a spanner!
Fuck off slag.
Katie! James!
Let me do it!
Wait! I can felt something. Katie. Get the doctor.
I don't want to ask.
Oh for fuck's sake, I'll go shall I?
Doctor. I felt something just now. A gripping movement. DOCTOR Anything else?
No, just a slight squeeze, is that a sign?
It could be a decorticate response. It's difficult to tell.
Right. How long's he going to be like this?
He's suffered a heart attack. It's hard to predict. You should all take a break. I'm sorry about him.
Yeah. Okay. We'll leave you to it. Come on. We'll just say goodbye to Uncle Spiros.
Would you mind staying around?
Of course.
So, he saved me twice. Once in the fire, and once after the banks. I was always embarrassed by him, you know. By his thing that he does. You know, his... 'thing'. But the thing that he does. It's a good thing really. These last few months. This year actually. This whole year. God. What a year. What a year. And yet. I've never felt so alive. I've never felt so engaged. Why is that? I mean why? I mean, I'm frying chips.
I love him. I've always loved him. And I love my children. I love... I love my life. I love it. Why is that? Why do I love it now? What was wrong with it before?
It's okay. It's okay.
It's a crazy, crazy, world. It's up, it's down. You fight. You win.  
No, no, no, no. Spiro.
I'll get someone.
Spiro mou. Spiro mou.
Ella bethi mou. Ella tho. You have to let me go. It's good. Michael's with us. Michael. O Mihalis. He was always there. Always with us. Always. Three brothers.
When I was a little boy. You cooked for me. Every time I came home. They were good times Spiro. Efharisto.
Itan Kali zoi. A good life. Now you understand. Levendis mou.
Did you do this?
It was for you. And Uncle Spiros. And Mum.
Thank you James.
This is the Ivy you saved, that night.
We meet again.
Did you know about this?
They can all go back to the house if you want. The plants. They're quite easy to move. But they're also very happy to grow here as well. If we choose to stay.
It's whatever you want to do Daddy. We're all really proud of you. The family embrace.
Theo mou. Good day at school?
Very good day. Impressed the teacher with his ability to solve quadratic equations.
That is fantastic.
Your friends are outside.
As you won't come to me, I thought I'd come to you.
I'm not changing my mind Rob.
I just want to talk.
Tell me this is a joke.
I don't want to do the deal. ROB Harry, you have seriously lost the plot on this one.
It just doesn't feel right.
We worked hard on this.
If he doesn't want to do the deal, he doesn't want to do it.
Shut up.
Hey. No need for that.
I don't understand. 
I've got everything I want.   And I've got no debt. And that feels   good. When I lock up my shop at night,   it feels good. I've got no debts, no   loans. I own it 100 per cent.
Come on. A percentage of something that could be worth millions. You'd walk away from that? For a chip shop?
Yeah. Right now? Yes. I would. And I'm with my children. And that's. You can't put a price on that Rob. And I'm having fun. We're having fun. Come back to the shop and let me cook you something to eat. Go on. We're doing great business. I'm actually thinking of expanding.
That's... That's... That's good Harry. That's, that's very good. I'm happy for you. If this is success.
What is success Rob? What is it? We've both had it. What is it? Is it the share price? Is it the profit earnings ratio? Is it a beautiful car.
You tell me Harry. You've had it all.
Yeah, I have. And I can tell you. Success is... the joy you feel. That's it. That's all it is. Success is the joy you feel!
Come on. Lets go.
I don't think so.
Okay. I'm sorry I shouted at you.
I don't care about that. I just don't want to work for you anymore.
Good luck people!
Best fish and chips in London!
Call me when you want to go public!
I just quit my job.
Yep. I think you did.
I'm just trying to work out what I'm feeling
And?
Bag of chips?
Ladies and gentlemen, meet our new bookkeeper.
Hello.
You may have to take a few shifts behind the counter.
Well. Got to learn the business from the inside.
Get the girl a Three Brothers coat.
Yes boss.
We are going to build a great business, from today.
I'm so excited.
Good times, eh?
I think so.
Katie. Tell Hassan to meet me outside. Laki, bring that kebab.
Hassn. Thank you for coming. Laki?
Kebab's are off the menu.
You're a good man. Thank you. We see KATIE and Mehmet hold hands.
We must celebrate. The Greek way. Yes? Come on.
No.
Someone get some plates. Get everyone.
No, I can't. I actually can't. I... I really don't know... I actually don't know how.
Hade re. Just make it up.
Come on Harry. I want to learn to. Teach us all how to dance.
Dad. What are you doing?
I think I'm going to dance. And then I'll teach you all.
Go on Daddy!
It's been such a long time since I did this. Amazing how it all comes back to you. Oh... This is!
Quick. Theo. Come and see your father. He's making the most delightful fool of himself.
