She coughs and nudges Ted to wake him up then pretend sleeps.
Good morning. Annie pretends to wake up.
Wow, you look beautiful.
Last night was fun.
Yeah, I had the best time. I have't had that much fun on a first date in years, ever... She brushes the hair off his forehead as if he were her long time lover.
So listen Annie, I like you. So, I want to be up front with you. I'm not really looking for a relationship right now. Annie's eyes grow large. She uncomfortably smiles at him, nodding.
Oooooo. Oops. I mean, yeah. What?
I just want to be honest right off the bat.
Yeah, yeah. Ok. Yeah. Yeah. I love that. Annie struggles to maintain her composure.
I'm just so busy and I don't have time for another person...I...
Yeah, me too, I'm soo busy--
And summer's coming--
Yeah, summer, exactly. It's a crazy season. So you just wanna give me a call in the fall or--?
Yeah, I'm not gonna be in town much even in the fall--
You shouldn't be! Yeah, Halloween--
I'm gonna be travelling a lot for work.
Me too, I'm just- so many business trips to places that are just far awaycause I'm doing really well at work.
And honestly,  I don't even know how I feel about the whole monogamy thing, is one person really enough for anyone? I mean, I like to be with a lot of different people.
It is sooo refreshing to hear you say that, because isn't that what everyone thinks but is afraid to say? I mean, i's science. I'm-I don't want a relationship either. Let's just say that. And I wouldn't even care whatever you do or I do, I just wanna have tons of fun, like no strings attached at all. I'm just different from other girls.
Yeah. Well anyway, I really should get going. I was gonna get a haircut today.
Yeah, they say that every couple months it's good to trim the ends, you know, get all the dead stuff. So, cool. Cool. 've cut hair before. He waits, but Annie doesn't budge.
Well, like I said I got stuff to do. Annie notices a picture of a sailboat above the bed.
Yeah, me too. Gonna try to get some sailing in before the weather gets crazy...
Cool, well I don't wanna be Get up the jib.. late. Ted gets up. Awkward moment leading into...
Oh, and thanks for the lemon bars.
Oh, no problem. Made from scratch.
Sometimes it sticks!
No, I love it! The gate starts to open. Annie exits.
Byyyyee!
Oh, shit. The brakes squeak as she very slowly drives away.
It's summer?! What the hell does that mean? He can't date anyone in the summer?
I guess? I don't know. I feel so stupid now.
No he's stupid Ann, not you.
I think I might be a little bit stupid.
Ew. Did you have sex with him?
No! But I gave him a blow job.
What?!
Well, he kept putting it in my face. Lillian's boyfriend DOUGIE enters the bedroom eating a Luna Bar in his sweats. He's stretching and flexing his muscles trying to make her laugh.
Well, at least he was honest with you so you don't waste your time with him.
Baby, look how hard I worked out. Look at all this sweat.
Can you see that I'm on the phone? I'm talking to Annie.
Hey Annie.
Are you eating my Luna Bar? Those are for women you know?
Shit. Really?!
It's not gonna do anything to you.
Oh my God. My breasts are getting bigger. He tries to rub up against Lillian.
Ew, go take a shower. Dougie leaves.
I'm gonna play with my new boobs in there.
I swear I cannot handle him right now. He has been driving me crazy. Sometimes it feels like I'm kissing my brother. I don't know what do. Annie pulls into an alleyway behind HARRINGTO'S JEWELRY STORE and starts changing into her work uniform in the car. A white blouse and navy skirt.
At least you have someone. God, wha's wrong with me?
There's nothing wrong with you. But I think maybe, and don't get mad at me, I've said this to you before, you need to stop trying so hard.
I still don't think I do that.
OK, so you had a first date last night. Did you bring him a present? Annie is silent.
Ann, what did I tell you?
I brought him lemon-bars because I was making them anyway, as a friend. Yo're right, that's weird.
Shit!
What?!
I just chipped a nail!
Ok, I don't know if it's because I'm tired or what, but I wanna kill him.
Ok, just take a deep breath, look in the mirror and remember when I was getting my braces off and farted at the orthodontist. Lillian laughs.
Oh my God. We need to hang out. 'm coming to Milwaukee this weekend.
Are you serious?
We'll go to Joni's and pig out and I'll bring some shitty magazines, and I'm gonna spend the night.
God, I haven't seen you in months!
I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. They hang up. Dougie is in the doorway wearing her nightie stretched over his body.
Baby, I'm going through some changes...
You're an idiot. We see she gets a kick out of him.
Hi. Sorry, sorry! I'm here. I'm here.
Annie! Thank God. OK people! Gather around me please, in a tight semicircle. Annie and six other employees gather around DONNA.
Something terrible has happened. Donald will not be coming in to work today. He stepped on a wasp and there is some uncomfortable swelling. Employees mumble.
Annie? Where's your tie? Everyone looks at Annie. She holds it up and starts to put it on.
Now, I have an eye doctor's appointment that I can't change or they'll will charge me. So someone will have to cover for Donald in engagement rings. Now I-- Annie and SANDY, a male co-worker, shoot their hands the air eagerly.
Sandy? Today's your day.
Ooh, my horoscope said I would be presented with an opportunity at work today. That is eerie. That is eerie.
Annie, that means you'll be alone in keepsakes. You think you can handle it?
Yeah, look out. There might be a bum- rush for letter openers... The employees snicker.
Sometimes there is, so....there have been. At times, there has been.
Alright everybody, let's get to work! Saneel?!...OPEN SESAME! SANEEL, the security guard, rolls his eyes and unlocks the doors. Everyone goes to work. Donna gathers her things and starts walking towards the exit with Annie tailing behind her.
Donna, can I talk to you for a second? I feel like if you gave me a shot at engagement rings sometime, I could really-
Annie, what is the calibration of a 2 carat diamond in a standard English setting?
Five?
I just made all of that up. None of that was real. I just put words together. You're not ready for the big leagues. Understand?
It's so hard to make commission over there.
Sweetheart...did I ever tell you the story of the little paralyzed Chinese girl who wanted to be dancer?
Many times.
She was paralyzed Annie, had no feeling in her legs, and then one day after years of believing in herself, she stood up out of that chair and tap-danced for the king. On his birthday! My point is, Sandy makes a real effort around here. He connects with the customer. And when he wants to make a sale, he goes for it.
Okay.  I do want it.
Good. Showing up on time is a wonderful place to start. Donna talks to herself and gathers her things.
Uhh! A wasp! Who walks around even their own backyard without at least a thin sandal. It's reckless! Donna exits. A customer passes Anni's section.
Hello, can I interest you in a sterling silver money clip that will create memories for you and your family? No? We cut to a HOME IMPROVEMENT SHOW on T.V.
When Dave and Rhonda bought this house, it was a medical clinic. I've never seen so many cupboards!
Noooo. That's, that's sooo smart. Annie enters the apartment, tired. She throws her keys down and sifts through her mail. Steve presses mute.
There you are, you stayer-out-all- nighter. Did you make out? Sleep over? As Annie heads for her bedroom, he walks towards her room.
Don't go in the bathroom. Are you going to bed?
Yes. I'm beat.
Your ex-boyfriend got more mail, I did what you said and just threw it away.
Thanks. Goodnight Steve! She shuts the door behind her.
That credit lady called! She wants to talk to you, Annie! She's gonna find you. Steve sits back on the couch, un-mutes the T.V..
This is where they bagged the animals that didn't make it through the testing. We turned it into a cozy Moroccan reading room.
Gross/Amazing.
You're right. God, she's getting really skinny.
Ann.
What?
Your boyfriend just walked in. REVEAL: An orange-skinned BODY BUILDER with HUGE arms and legs in a tiny muscle tank and shorts.
Oh my God! Look, he showed up with your mom. It's a short grey-haired OUTDOORSEY WOMAN in hiking boots. They laugh to themselves. Annie keeps reading.
Cool! They're making a WKRP movie.
Here Annie, let me turn the page for you.
What? Lillian splays her hand over the magazine showing off a sparkling DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.
I just want to help you turn the page of your magazine for you...
Lillian! What is that?!
I'm engaged.
What?!!
He proposed at dinner last night. I wanted to tell you in person and show you this rock!
It's beautiful. Lillian. Oh my God, this is...this is crazy!
I know Dougie and I have been fighting a lot, but I've been so stressed out with
That's not I mean. I mean, I remember when we met him at Lake Mills. You lost your virginity to him right in front of me on the dock, remember?
Oh you want to get into who's done what down at the lake?
No, I don't. It's just making me realize how long we've known each other.
Well then, who better to be my Maid of Honor?
Oh my God! I don't know what to say!
Annie, you're my best friend. Honestly I didn't even have to think about it.
Uh, wow. Yes! Of course! Yes! My God. I've never been in a wedding.
It's no big deal, and I don't want to make it one. It's not gonna be a big crazy thing. I wanna keep it simple. What dessert are you gonna get?
I know what you're doing. Don't downplay this. I'm happy for you. And someday when hell freezes over and I get married, you can be my Maid of Honor. But for right now, this is about you. OK? This is you're day, and it is a big deal.
Ok, but I still don't want this to be a huge production. I just want to have all my friends meet each other, have fun, dance, drink, whatever.
Then that's what it'll be. Did you guys set a date?
Oh God, not yet. I don't want a super long engagement, but there's a lot to do.
Well you are very fortunate because you happen have the best maid of honor in the whole wide world, and-- Lillian's cell phone rings, she looks at it and smiles.
Can you hold that thought. I's my fiancee calling. Lillian gets up laughing. Annie laughs along with her.
Ooo, haha... Annie continues laughing alone. She looks around the room as her smile disappears. She remembers...
Annie and Lillian at 7 years old standing outside eating popsicles, smiling.
Lillian Marie Donovan. Do you take your husband, forever, to be your husband? Lillian stands by a poster of Eric Estrada in his C.H.I.P.s uniform that is taped to a tree.
I do. Do you Annie Lucille Walker, take your husband, forever? Reveal Annie standing next to a poster of John Baker from Chips.
I do.
And now we will leave on our honeymoon to...
The girls rip the posters off of the trees. An old station wagon sits in the dirt driveway. They get in the back seat, look straight ahead and just sit there.
thought.
The madness has begun. Dougie's parents are having an engagement party for us next Friday.
Awesome!...
Ooh, what's this... She finds the article. Hurry, before he gets away! Top five ways to reel him in.
Excuse me. A HOT ATHLETIC GUY with his golden retriever is reaching for a magazine. She can't thing of what to say. She remembers the magazine! It reads #1. A simple, flirty
working! Her cell phone rings, she tries to ignore it, but it keeps ringing...
Hello?
Annie!?
Yes? It's HELEN  Lillian's bridesmaid and friend from the tennis Club. She's a tall leggy blond, all smiles. East coast pretty with a lot of cream cashmere turtleneck sweaters in her closet. She is sitting in a cream colored living room on a huge cream couch with lots of candles glowing.
Hi.
Hi.
Hiiii! This is Helen. I'm one of Lillian's bridesmaids.
Of course, Helen. Hi!
Congratulations on being selected.
Oh, thank you. Annie, reads #2. Expose your best asset. ASAP She panics, starts to elongate her right leg, points her toe, flexes her leg, flips her hair. He seems confused but politely smiles and goes back to his magazine.
Annie?
Sorry, yes. Hi!
Maid of Honor!!
Yeah. It is quite an honor.
It's the number one spot. So how many times have you been in the B.P?
I'm sorry, the what?
Bridal Party?
I've never even been in a wedding before.
What!? I've never even heard of that.
Um, well, it should be fun. Annie sees that the hot guy is leaving to pay for his magazine! She reads#5. Make a funny observational joke that pertains to HIM. (ya know, LIKE SEINFELD!!] Men LOVE
and the golden retriever meet eyes.
Um Helen, can you hold on for a second?
Annie covers the phone and approaches the hot guy.
Hey, you're dog's really cute.
Oh thanks.
It's kinda funny right? That when girls are ugly, they're called dogs, but dogs are cute. Annie laughs. He half smiles but does not respond.
Well, some dogs are ugly. Some girls are ugly. I know a lot of ugly girls. But I'm not friends with them. I've seen a lot of ugly dogs too. But some people I know who are considered dogs, you know, they have a good personality, and are better looking to people cuz of that. And people who are not nice...that's ugly to me. And female dogs are called bitches, that's weird. I'm just kidding. It's a joke. I have better ones. The guy leaves. She hears a voice coming from her phone.
Hello?!
Helen! Sorry. Yeah um, I'm really excited for all the wedding stuff and--
YAY! OK, I will get your e-mail from Lilly with all of the other girls' information, and when you respond to any wedding related e-mails from now on, just remember to hit REPLY ALL. Did you know there are six of us?
Yeah, Lillian told me last night. Awkward silence.
Well, can't wait to meet you and hear what your planning for the bachelorette. Any ideas?
Not yet. But they are coming, and I will fill you in--
Oop! There goes my other line. See you Friday! She realizes there might some research to do for this bridal party' thing. She instead grabs two wedding magazines.
Just these. Noticing a magazine by the register that reads (some bad
And this.

Oh my God.
He probably didn't see you, Mom.
Oh, he saw me alright. He was married to me for fourteen years, he knows what I look like. I'm sure it was because BARB was there. You know how jealous she gets.
Yeah, I'm sure that's it mom.
Am I on speaker phone?
Yeah.
I don't know how to talk this way.
Mom I'm running a little late so--
Oh, the engagement party. Lillia's getting married, I can't believe how time flies. You're day will come dear. Give Lillian a kiss for me please, and tell Laurie and Ed I just could't afford the plane ticket, but I will be at the shower.
I already told them, they understand.
BARB could afford to come. Did you know what kind of car she drives now? A 2007 P.T. Cruiser. She looks ridiculous parading all around Fort Myers in that thing.
Ok, Mom--
I don't know how she gets in and out of that little car with those big legs.
I should get going. I have long drive.
Oh and honey, I picked you up a couple of things when I was at the Steinmart with Janice so look for a package in the mail.
Mom I told you you don't have to send me--
Oh stop. I love doing it. Ok? I love you sweetie.
I love you too Mom. Bye. They hang up. Annie walks to the kitchen.
Ok, how do I look?
Ooooh. You tryin to hook up tonight? A lot of people do at these wedding things you know so you have a good chance.
Nevermind...
I like the black tights with the black shoes, it's very elongating.
Oh. Well, thank you.
But I think you need more dark up top to balance it out, do have any black beads?
(looking at herself] That's actually a good idea. She starts to leave but sees a guilty look and some frosting on Steve's face. She looks over at her saran- 's.
How many moonpies have you eaten? Tell me the truth.
Um......two.
Ok, now really tell me the truth. How many did you eat?
Four. Nine. They stare at each other.
Shit! She pulls over. OFFICER RHODES approaches, chewing gum.
Good afternoon ma'am, You in a hurry to get out of the city?
No. Was I speeding?
Is that even possible in this rig? He finds this funny, Annie does't.
You know funny thing about brake lights, you're supposed to have em.
Ooooh. Yeah. Mine are out.
Yeah, and you're headin' up Witches Curve. That's a risky move.
I'm sorry. I usually only drive in the city and they've never pulled me over. To tell you the truth, those lights have been out for like a year.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy hot-dogger. That is not something you wanna go broadcasting to a police officer. I might feel obligated to give you a yea's worth of tickets now.
What? No.. I-
You just admitted it.
Can you do that?
You admitted it.  Yeah, I can't do that though.
Look, I'm really sorry. I promise I will get the lights fixed tomorrow morning. I'm kind of in a hurry. I'm going to my best friend's engagement party, I'm the Maid of honor and so I really -
Oh, yeah. My little sister was just in a wedding. She lost some of her hair from the stress. Again, not funny.
Am I getting a ticket? He searches for words. She's cute and he wants to keep her there. He keeps smiling. Awkward silence.
Uh, yeah. That's what happens when you break the law. Um...license and registration.
Here. He writes a ticket.
Ooo, I like that air freshener. Did you get that at the gas station?
I don't remember.
Smells like Christmas.  Yeah, it smells like Christmas. He rips the ticket off.
Well, here you go. And just so you know it's a just a fix-it ticket. So if you get those lights repaired, you wo't have to pay anything.
Oh, Okay.
Whoa, are those moon-pies?
Oh yeah.
Oh, those are my favorite.
What?
Nothing.  Those are my favorite.
Do you want one?
No. It's too much trouble, they look all wrapped up. She doesn't get the hint. He really wants one.
Well, have fun at your party. Annie drives off. He watches.
Annie, sweetheart!
Hi Mrs. Donovan! They hug.
Oh! And you brought your famous moonpies! Laurie takes the tray.
Can you believe our Lillian?
I know, I'm so happy for her.
Well, clue me in. Is there anyone special in your life?
Nope.
That's my girl.  Sleep around. I'm serious. Travel the world and try all the cuisine you can. You know what I mean by that, right? MARY, Laurie's friend, approaches.
Laurie, where did you get that sweater? It is one-hundred percent out-of-sight!
Shhh, I got it at Glory Gay's.
Ooooh. I can't even walk in there. The blouses alone make my wallet open.
It's worth it, though huh? Mary, I want you to meet Lillian's Maid of Honor.
Oh, very special job.
This is Annie Walker. She lived next door to us in Milwaukee until the girls graduated from high school.
Hi.
Ann!
Lil! It was nice meeting you Mary. Annie leaves.
Her father ran off to Florida with a younger woman who was working at a Chrysler dealership.
Oh my.
Poor Judy, never quite got over it. She also ended up moving to Florida to take care of her parents.
Oh, that is tough. Well it's nice Annie and Lillian have stayed friends.
They're like sisters.
Hey!
Hey! What's up? Where's Dougie?
Smoking a cigar with my dad. Le's go get a drink. They weave towards the bar.
Annie!!!
Hold on Dougie, we're getting drinks! They get to the bar and grab glasses of wine.
This place is so fancy. Dougie's parents belong here?
Yeah. So does Dougie. This is the tennis club I've been playing at.
Oh. Wow. I guess it's not what I pictured. Lucky you.
Tennis courts are tennis courts if you ask me. But I have met a lot of really cool people here. I can't wait for you to meet the girls.
Oh! So where's this guy you were telling me about?
Oh shoot, Matt's not coming. I guess he got back together with his ex or something. Anyway, Dougie just told me. Sorry.
That's ok.
There she is! Dougie picks Annie up and swings her around.
Dougie, be careful. God, you reek! He puts her down.
Annie, make sure when my fiance gets cold feet you tell her what a great guy I am. He grabs Lillian and kisses her on the cheek.
Ugh. Wash your face. She gives in and kisses him. Then says to Annie..
Come on. Let's go say hi to the rest of the bridal party. They approach LESLIE, Lillian's cousin, late 30's, standing with her husband PAUL.
Leslie, hi! How are you guys?
Well, I just squeezed my third kid out last month and I feel like I'm walking around in a fat suit. She swigs beer out of a bottle.
I keep telling her she looks great. Oh, I'm sorry. Is this your boyfriend? A 30 YEAR OLD AVERAGE GUY with a neckbrace stands behind Annie. Paul goes to shake his hand. She stops him.
No, no.  No. Annie meets DANA who is with her husband Ernie.
Annie this is Dana, we met here in my tennis class. Dana, Annie.
Hi! Dana Shig. Its so nice to finally meet you Annie. I've heard so much about you. This is my husband Ernie. ERNIE has just put food in his mouth.
Don't you just love weddings? I mean, I just love like the feeling and...everyone comes together you know? And it's forever! It's a journey, and WE get to go on it too!
Wow, that's beautiful. I never thought of it that way.
This is all so amazing. I'm going to make a scrap book for Lillian. Dana takes her camera out then reaches out her hand.
Hi. I'm Dana and this is my husband Ernie. So...how did you two meet? She refers to a bald man who looks like a chemistry teacher, who is slowly walking by looking for someone.
No, I don't know him. He's not with me. He's just passing by. I'm not here with anyone. BECCA stands very close to her husband KEVIN, a good looking stockbroker type.
Lil! Is this Annie?! Annie and Lillian walk over.
Hi Annie! I'm Becca. I've heard so much about you. This is my husband Kevin.
Dougie's partner.
So, are you so excited?! All of this reminds me so much of my wedding.
Two months now! It was the best day of my life. I'm married now! It's like...I'm just better now! It might sound weird but... I feel legit. Just like, feminine. Look at my nails! Two beautifully french manicured hands with a HUGE 3 carat diamond ring.
Ooooops, where are my manners. Hi! I'm Becca Whitman. REVEAL a very smart looking, older African-American MAN standing next to Annie. He is wearing an ascot and smoking a pipe.
The name's Captain Arnold Dubois. MEGAN is Dougie's sister. An ODDBALL. She looks like she might be at the wrong party. She is single and lovin' it!
Annie! Hey! What's up?
Megan! How are you?
I just got pins in my leg! I fell off a cruise ship.
Oh shit!
Yeah. I was on a singles cruise. It was nighttime.
I was port-side, having a drink with a gentlemen and old Megan here decided to show off and I tried to climb into one of the lifeboats with my clogs on. I saw a dolphin.
Wow. Well, I'm glad you're OK.
Listen Annie. You're single right? You and I are gonna scam on guys this whole time. You and I are gonna party and get naked with guys. This whole time Annie, no bailing. Lillian re-appears, grabs Annie.
Ann, there you are!
Think about what I said Annie!
I'm saving you. Now I really want to introduce you to Helen. looking around) There she is. In slow motion, a tall and gorgeous HELEN turns to us. She wears a tight, cream-colored, floor-length evening gown. Annie straightens her plastic beads.
Helen, this is Annie.
Hiii.
Hi.
Hiii. This is my husband Perry.
Perry owns Atmospheria candles.
Oh, the Starbuck's of the candle world? Those are popping up on every corner. Which one do you own?
All of them. It's the family business, his father started it.
Oh, wow, that's pretty cule.
Yeah, yeah. Currently we dominate the U.S. home illumination sector as a whole and six out of seven homes in upscale neighborhoods have one of our products, including the club.
That is a lot.
Perry donated a few for tonight. The room is all aflame.
So how do you like our club?
Yeah, I was just telling Lillian i's very elegant.
So you live in Milwaukee?
Yeah in the nice part. I work at Harrington's Jeweler's. I love it.
I think I've heard of them.
It's pretty well-known in the jewelry world. It's got like the biggest market for all the jewelry they sell and 'm actually gonna be getting a promotion
You are?
Yeah, so I'm pretty excited about it. It's gonna be...pretty big. So, if you ever need a discount--
You're funny. Listen Annie,I know you said you've never been in a wedding before so I just want you to know that we all have, especially me, so if you need any help, don't hesitate to ask.
Thank you.
So cheers to you two, our last single friends finally crossing over into the world of marital bliss, welcome to the other side! Dana snaps a photo, crying. Helen approaches the podium.
Hello everyone. My name is Helen Harris the Third, an honored member of the bridal party. In honor of Lillian and Dougie, I'd like to take this opportunity to read a poem that I penned last summer while I was sitting on a swing at an exclusive resort in Santorini. Annie whispers to the person next to her.
Am I supposed to give a speech? As Helen reads, Annie looks around the room and sees everyone in awe. Dana starts to cry. She reads from a fancy sheet of stationary.
With every blink of an eye, every kiss of a lip, every stroke of a lovers hand, every...scent of a woman, every breath you take, every move you make. Love conquers all. Annie sees that Lillian is touched. Helen gets emotional.
They say when you choose a mate, yo're choosing a best friend. Dougie, yo're a lucky man. Lillian, I know you're going to make a wonderful wife, because you have been the best friend that I could ever ask for. Annie's face goes blank.
I have never had a friendship like this. I'm so happy you two are finally taking this big step together and I ca't wait for all of the adventures that await us. People are moved, sniffling. Including Lillian.
Now Dougly, sorry, inside joke. You better not keep my Lil on a leash. I still need my drunken nights at Rockin Sushi! TO DOUGIE AND LILLIAN!!! The crowd erupts with laughter and applause. People are crying, hugging, and standing.
Thank you. Thank you! Now wher's Annie? Annie? Stand up Annie. The room looks around. Annie slowly rises.
There she is. Annie is our Maid of Honor everyone. And I'm sure she'd like to take this time to say a few words. Annie? Annie stands up to the applause. The room falls silent as she walks to the podium.
Um, hello everybody. Hi everyone. 'm Annie. Wow, it really smells like vanilla in here.
It's the candles Annie.
Thanks Megan. Lillian this is gonna be awesome. Um, uh, God, oh, oh, oh, what's that saying?
Ayay, um, God, um, what is it? It's a good one, a good saying, it's Irish. It's like a-like a toast. Is it Irish? Something about a road...Oh God, 'm blanking. So I'll just say I'm so happy to be a part of this whole celebration and happiness. You two are so happy together and hope you have a happy lifetime of happiness and celebrating. And I love you and....Lillian, w've been best friends since we were like 5...'ve never been to Greece... 't know if she's done. Annie sees Helen has moved over to sit next to Lillian.
Did you ever know that you're my hero...You're everything I wish I could be.. C'mon you guys know the words. Some people reluctantly sing along.
I could fly higher then an eagle. For you are the wind beneath my wings. Flyyy, flyyyyy, so fly into the sky, so fly until we touch up high--
Oh my God, tell me I didn't sing.
No, you sang. They both laugh.
God, I don't know, I was just maybe a little out of my element, and after Helen's speech--
Ann, stop.
I'm so embarrassed. What did you think of your engagement party?
Besides the impromptu concert from Bette Midler, it was perfect. They laugh and hug.
I gotta go say bye to some people I do't know. Drive safe. Lillian goes back inside. Helen appears out of thin air.
Annie! Great job tonight..
I'm feeling slightly mortified.
No, nononono. Not at all. Everyone gets a little nervous and carried away during those kind of things. So listen, 've been brainstorming some theme ideas for Lillian's shower. I was thinking somewhere along the lines of Alice in Wonderland meets...are you ready? Hollywood. And for the bachelorette? Vegas.
Aren't I supposed to be planning some of these things?
Oh, well, I hadn't heard from you and--
She just got engaged two weeks ago.
Well, I figured since you don't have any experience that you might get overwhelmed by events of this caliber.
Helen, I'm pretty capable. I think I can handle it. A guest walks by and taps Helen.
Excuse me, you left your poem inside. You have beautiful cursive.
Thank you. The guest says nothing to Annie and walks away.
Annie, I didn't mean I didn't think you couldn't do it. I'm sure you are aware of all your duties. We'll see--we'll see you soon. Helen walks away. A OLD LADY passes by her.
You're very pretty.
Annie! Megan is running towards her with a piece of paper.
Annie wait! I wanna give you my numbers. A place just opened up near my house. From 4-7 every weekday, Karaoke, two dollar wings and all you can eat MAN sandwiches if you know what I mean. Annie is nervous, starts biting her nails.
Your nail too short for french manicure.
Oh well...
That's Ok. I fix for you. Make you sexy.
Oh, great!
And then they put a solution in my eyes to dilate them, which caused temporary blindness and with the loss of my sight, my hearing became bionic. Do you need some help dear? Annie struggles to open a bag of chips but her new ULTRA LONG, french-manicured nail-tips are making it very hard.
No, I got it.
Sorry... Well, it's official. Lillian set a date. October tenth. Why did I just get a stomach ache.
Don't be nervous. It's not all on your shoulders. Doesnt she have other bridesmaids?
Yeah and they've all done this before so I'm feeling a little pressure. I have to make this really nice for Lillian.
I wish I could help. Weddings are a lot different now then they were in my day. They look at Donna's wedding picture on her desk.
That dress is beautiful.
I still have it. I was hoping my daughter Elizabeth would wear it but when she and Alice had their ceremony they both wanted to wear suits.  Ok, we need two Shannisburg tennis bracelets. Annie struggles to write with her nails.
Oops. Hold on a sec, hard to write...
They're very long.
Hi. I need to make these shorter.
No, not sexy!
I know, it's... I can't work with them so long.
Okay. 7 dollar for file. No more sexy though.
Ok.
Short nail is ugly.
Alright.
Here it is!
Ooh, Occasionz. I'm impressed.
Everyone this is Occasionz, supposedly it's you know, one of the best bridal shops in town, so, that's cool. Oh and also, there's a restaurant inside, so um, I figured, we could maybe have lunch after. So, let's go! She goes to the door. It is locked. She sees a buzzer.
Oh, I didn't see that. She presses the buzzer.
Hi, we're hear to see some bridesmaids dresses.
Oh, Annie.
Oh, she must be talking about the restaurant. (back into the intercom) No, we're here to look at dresses.
You didn't make a reservation?
Um, no, I'm sorry, I didn't know I had to make a reservation for that. Sorry! Anyway, we're all out here now and--
Seven weeks?!
What?
You didn't make an appointment?
No, I can hear you. Would it be possible for you to make an exception for us because we drove all the way out here and I didn't know about the reservation/ appointment thing so...
Annie, we can go somewhere else.
No, no. I'll work it out. Don't worry.
This really is the best place though, that's the thing.
Listen, I know the--
(intercom] Hello, this is the manager?
Yes, hello!
We can fit you in seven weeks, that is all we have available. We only take parties that have a reservation and that have made an appointment over the phone. I'm going to ask you to not buzz in again. Thank you. Byyyyyyye. Helen approaches the intercom.
Whitney?
Yes? Who is this?
Whit, it's Helen.
Helen?! Hiiii!
Hiiii!
Hi!
Hi! Listen, I'm out here with a whole bunch of girls and we had a little miscommunication and our reservation- appointment wasn't made. Is there any way to fit us in?
Say no more. Buzzzzzzzz. The girls happily enter.
(sotto} Wow, thanks Helen.
Ann, don't worry about it. We got in. Annie sees racks of wedding dresses.
Hey, you want to sneak off and look at the wedding dresses?
Oh my God. Annie, I didn't tell you? Guess who Helen is friends with? Lady Lavonia Jean St. Petsois JuJu.
That famous wedding dress designer tha's in all those wedding magazines? As a favor to Helen she's going to design my dress for almost nothing. Normally they're like twenty grand. She's French.
Wow. That's amazing.
Surprise, surprise. It's my Mom. Mom? Can you hold on a second? She covers the phone and talks to the girls.
Start looking at dresses. I'll be right back. I think maybe you guys should decide anyway and pick out something you like since you're the ones wearing it. Cool?  Have fun! What's up Mom? Ugh! They're booked? Lillian leaves talking to her Mom.
Ok ladies, start your  engines! Shots of dresses being pulled off of the racks. Fighting for the same dress, shirts coming off, dresses zipped up the back and dresses not fitting, etc.
Hi I'm Annie. Can I get a martini? What you mean you need to see I.D.?
Well, with that dress on you look about... .eleven.
Thank you. Annie laughs. And turns away right into, a GORGEOUS male model in a tuxedo.
I'll get it for her.
Hi.
Hi. I'm Christian Bale. I'm just chopping some wood, I like to do that between movies.
Hello Christian. They hear the voices of the men from the party screaming for her.
Oh, Christian! I need a place to hide.
Quick, get inside my muscles. They embrace.
I love this sash. They look into each others' eyes, just about to kiss and--
Hi Annie!
Look at your cute little boobies. Ooh, is that the dress you like?
Yeah. I think it will look good on everybody, it has a sash--
A sash? Annie, this isn't the Sound of Music tryouts.
Huh?
I told you Becca I can't wear strapless!
Why not?! Annie and Helen come out to see all the bridesmaids arguing.
Because, I--
Why don't you two shut your traps? No one's going to be looking at us. Le's just get the one with the shawl, 'm always freezing at these things anyway.
I gotta say I'm still leaning towards the one that I found. It is a very ugly.
Absolutely not.
Well, what about this one? Everybody stops and looks at Annie.
I think it would be flattering on everyone and we could totally wear it again. The sash comes in different colors not just this one.
Everyone! We can't all have the dress that we want. I've been in a lot of weddings and when choosing a bridesmaid dress, you must ask yourself, If invited, would I wear this a dress to...The ACADEMY AWARDS!
Ooo, I never thought of it that way. All the girls agree.
With that in mind, I say we wear this one. Helen holds up a dress. The girls like it.
Or this one! People wear sashes to the Academy Awards all the time.
Only if they're nominated for the Sound of Music.
I think Lillian would like this one.
Well, I think Lillian would like THIS one. Lillian walks in.
Hey! I'm hearing lots of excitement in here. She touches Helen's dress.
Oooo, I like this one. What about you guys?
I love it. Right guys? The girls all agree. Except Annie.
Cool. Let's eat! Helen dumps the dress in Annie's arms and follows Lillian.
I think it might look best in cream.
Ooh, good idea. They exit.
Well, that was easy. The girls head back to change.
This dress is almost $500!
That's not too bad/that sounds about right.
No, that's what I'm saying. That's a great price.
This place is kind of amazing. I did't even know it existed.
The southwestern cobb is really good. I come here and eat sometimes.
Great, there's a fly that really likes me.
They only have salads.
So Annie, what's your deal? Are you dating anyone?
No, no. Not right now. I had a boyfriend for three years but we broke up like six months ago.
Oh, I hate to hear stuff like that! What happened?
It just didn't work out.
Is that the guy who stole a bunch of money from you and gave you an STD? Everyone freezes.
Lillian told me. Annie shoots Lillian a look.
I'm sorry, I was just talking about you cause I was worried about you and--
No it's fine. But he didn't steal the money, I loaned it to him. And HPV is really common right now. Everyone looks around.
Around fifty percent of sexually active men and women acquire HPV at some point in their lives and by age fifty, eighty percent of women will be infected with a genital HPV infection.
Really?
About 6.2 million new cases of HPV affect Americans each year.
Ew, it's on the butter you guys. The fly's on the butter.
Well, I don't have it.
Very few HPV infections show any signs or symptoms. Therefore a lot of infected people don't even know they have it, yet they transmit the virus to their sexual partner. Silent. Everyone is a little grossed out..
Anyway, it's fine, the past is the past. We weren't meant to be. My last pap-smear came back normal so that's cule. But you know, I'm dating, here and there...
Do you have anyone in mind to bring to the wedding?
Oh, I didn't even think about that.
Who needs a date? Just go stag and make out with someone there.
If you wanna meet a nice man, Annie, you should come to karaoke night at my church. We sing hymns to rock beats!
Wait. I have the perfect guy for you Annie. Mike Donahue. He went to school with Kevin.
Mike from the fourth of July last year? Ooh, I've seen him Ann. He's hot.
Really?
And Kevin said he just sold his company for an embarrassing amount of money. But he's totally down to earth. You guys have to meet. I'm texting Kevin right now.
I know Mike too. Megan is digging a dead fly out of the butter.
The fly just committed suicide. Death by butter.
Oh my gosh, if you guys got married you could live out here and see us all the time!
Yeah, and then pop out a couple kids, sit around and talk about nothing while your vagina flaps in the wind like a wet paper towel.
Oooh, I didn't know we were going to hear that word at lunch today.
I was set up with Ernie. As soon as I met him, I knew.
Yeah Annie, you never know.
Yes.
What?! Come on! She pulls over. Officer Rhodes approaches.
Well, look who it is.
Oh hi.
I see your still driving around with busted tail lights.
I'm sorry, money's been tight and...I forgot. You're not gonna give me another ticket for that are you?
Nah... The reason I pulled you over today, is that-- you were driving too slow. Backing up traffic.
I was?
Yep. You were going ten miles under the speed limit. That's a moving violation. It's...underdriving. It's in the books. But, I'm just going to give you a warning this time, but I do have to um...write some stuff down on a piece of paper. He begins to write. Beat.
Man I'm hungry. I'm doing the Master Cleanse. You ever heard of it?
Yeah.
Cayenne pepper water for three days now. It's supposed to clean you out, make you feel lighter. It's working. The only problem is I get so hungry. I just want a big slab of ribs. You ever crave that kind of stuff?
Don't talk about cravings right now. I am PMS'ing like crazy. It's taking everything in me not to stop and the store and get like three kit-kats and a bottle of wine. I'm so irritable right now. They stare at each other out of awkwardness.
Sorry.
No, it's OK, I've got three sisters. We had tampons in the pencil drawer. Sometimes my friends and I would say they were cigars and smoke'em.  Okay. I have finished writing down the things I need to write, on this paper. OH! He hands her a business card.
This is a buddy of mine. Owns a body shop in Milwaukee. Might be able to help you out for a good price with those taillights. I'll write my name on here so you can tell him who referred you.
Thanks.
That's my name right there. In case you forgot it from last time. It's Nathan Rhodes.
Thanks. Annie. I'll get those fixed. I get paid next week. Bye! She drives off. Rhodes wishes he had been more suave.
Trust me, I've been in the jewelry business for a long time. Nothing says I'm sorry for your loss' like a sterling silver money clip. An OLD WOMAN CUSTOMER looks at her stone-faced.
We also have yo-yos you can engrave. In memory of...um, what's your friend's name? The old woman walks away as Sandy approaches.
Paychecks. Here you go Annie. She and Sandy open their checks.
Oh my God, I scored this week. 'm gonna buy Sharita a new Panasonic telephone. It's cordless and has intercom. What about you Annie?
I'm gonna pay for a cream-colored gown that I'll never wear again.
Help me! I can't find anything to wear for my date with Mike tonight.
I don't know. Shoot, I can't talk now. I'm with Helen and we have a conference call with Lady Lavonia Jean St. Petsois JuJu about my dress. Ugh. I'm so sorry. She's calling! I gotta go. Have fun! Lillian hangs up. Steve walks in.
That credit lady called you again. I told her you were at the tailors.
Listen, I'm going on a date. This? (holds up a dress) or this?
I don't like those pants.
What's wrong with'em?
They give you four corners. Annie's not following.
It's when a girls butt looks like it has four corners. It's not a good thing.
Shit. These are my only clean pants.
Do you have a tube skirt?
Thanks Steve.
Wait. If you stand like you are right now facing that angle, it looks good. She looks in the mirror again, grabs her bag and leaves.
I'm not an expert in corporate real- estate but I've always been interested in it. So, yeah I totally agree. Mike smiles, he is cute!
I have to admit, I told Becca 'm not really keen on set-ups. I know i's early, but so far so good.
Me too.
And thanks again for coming from Milwaukee, I know it's quite a drive.
I can do that drive in my sleep these days.
Next time maybe I'll come to you. Annie smiles.
You have got great teeth.
Thank you. I brush'em every day. She flashes her teeth. The hostess comes up.
Your tables ready.
Finally! Mike guzzles down his cocktail as they read their menus.
Well, I don't know about you but since we're at a Thai restaurant, I'm gonna try the dog. Mike laughs at his own joke and continues drinking.
So, Becca tells me you play a lot of tennis.
I try to squeeze in a game now and then. We should play sometime.
Oh, yeah I haven't rea--
Here ya go. I'll be back to take your order in two secs. I'm swamped!
No problem.
Whoa, get a load of our waiter. 'm surprised he didn't put pink umbrellas in our drinks... Annie laughs, but is a little uncomfortable.
Or AIDS. Mike laughs. Annie is HORRIFIED. Mike swigs from his drink.
Seriously, AIDS is crazy. You do't have it do you?
No.
Neither do I... He raises his eyebrows up and down at her.
Annie hasn't touched her food. He's eating with his hands and drunk. Other patrons are beginning to stare.
Whoa-ho! Excyuuuuse me! I got that from Steve Martin. Still laughing, he pats his pockets.
Oh shit. I forgot my wallet.
Hey, it's me, I just had to tell you about my night. Oh my God. Call me.
Annie Walker. I thought I heard your car out there.
Very funny, Officer...Jones?
Jones? Oh boy. Guess somebody thought he was a little more memorable than he was.
No. Sorry. I'm a little out of it. I'm not drunk.
That's ok. Call me Rhodes. (notices her drink) Trying to get calm?
Yeah. Recovering from a date.
Oh.
Finish your cleanse?
Yeah, trying to wean myself back to the really bad foods I like eating.
Thanks for the drink.  So are you one of those cops that sits in that same spot everyday and sneaks up on people?
A lot of people get up to high speeds on this road. I tell people its better to pay for a ticket than have your family pay for a funeral.
That's a very good point.
Want a carrot?
Yes. I'm starving.
They are leaning on the back of his car eating carrots.
Ew! What is this? Annie pulls out a very dry, warped discolored carrot.
Oh, you got the ugly carrot.
The what?
There's one in every bag. You should eat it.
No. I think you should eat it. The're your carrots. He goes to eat it. She grabs it out of his hands.
No, no! Don't eat it! EW!!! She throws it on the ground.
Don't litter. He picks it up.
I don't think I've ever wanted to get of out a restaurant faster in my life.
Yeah, I don't go on blind dates. It seems unnatural.
I have no idea what am I going to tell my friends who set us up.
Just tell her the truth.
Yeah. You're probably right. Now Rhodes and Annie are driving in his police car.
It's an ok job. It's commission, so it's unpredictable. I don't know, I always wanted to finish my bachelor's but that's kind of financially impossible right now. Plus I'd feel like ninety around all those college students.
You know my dad used to say that life is like a hallway of doors. You can stand at the same door forever if you want. Or you can open a different door. And that one may not be the right door, but i'll open up a whole new hallway of doors. Anyway, it worked for me. I was kinda lost and I opened a door and the next thing I knew I was a cop. And I love my job.
Hmm. I think I get it?
Or you can always sell moon-pies by the side of the road.
Moonpies. What?
It's a joke. You had moon-pies in your car the first time I pulled you over.
Oh yeah.
When I get married I don't want the kind of wedding people have these days. I want it to be like a carnival. You know dunk tanks? People win prizes...
Yeah, and you can have elephants, trapeze artists and a big scale to guess the bride's weight.
Ok, first of all that's a circus wedding and I'm talking about a carnival wedding.
Sorry.  Yeah I'll have the number four, and can you make that Super Biggie?
They are sitting in the restaurant, mouths full of
And then she moved to Hawaii and now lives with a guy who sells shaved ice. And supposedly she has really long armpit hair now. That's pretty much the last girlfriend I had.
Well, lets just say my last boyfriend that I lived with broke up with me over the phone. Then come to find out, he had borrowed $30,000 in my name without telling me, putting me in horrible debt that I'm still paying off. Because I can't find him.
Wow. You win.
Oh my gosh. It's twelve thirty! I should probably...
Oh, before you go. There is something I want to give you. I was gonna wait but, I think you'll want this now. He jokingly gives her the ugly carrot.
For me?!
Well I know you've had a terrible night. He gives it to her. Her phone rings.
Sorry, one sec. Hello? Ted!? Hey! Oh my gosh! No,no. Can you hold on a sec? She waves at Rhodes and mouths...
I guess I'll see you around?
Yeah. Don't forget about those taillights. They're really starting to bug me.
K. Bye. So, you're in town?
Next time I won't call so late.
No, it was fine. Like I said, I mean I was just driving.
Awesome. It's cool that we can just hookup and whatever. No strings.
Me too. I love it. I feel good right now.
Cool. Bye.
Shit!! No! No! I left my fucking credit card at the restaurant! Shit! She picks up her phone and dials.
Hi, Donna, it's Annie. Um, sorry but I just ran out of gas and I'm gonna be a little bit late. Yes, I know, 'm really sorry. I will get there as soon as I can. I promise, I'm so sor---hello?
Annie, hi! I almost left, but they said that you were coming and that you were late. Helen is standing there looking gorgeous.
I had to come into Milwaukee for a charity luncheon right down the street and I thought I'd come in and say hi.
Hi!
And as the leader of the bridesmaids, I thought it'd be fun to pick up some little gifts for all the girls.
Leader of the bridesmaids? Um, wouldn't that technically be me? Honor?
Well, no, sweetie, you're the Maid of Honor, and we're all bridesmaids, and out of all of us, I'm the leader. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Um, I wanted to get something that we could wear to the rehearsal dinner or something. That would be fun. Where are the diamonds?
Oh, well, what about a nice pen..or a tortoise-shell handled sterling silver letter opener? No? Ok, let me get Sandy.
Oh! And Annie we really need to start planning the bachelorette.
Yes. Yes. I'm on it. Got some ideas. So I'll let you know.
Can't wait.
Wow, well I have never seen a transformation like this. This old tour bus is stunning.
Unbelievable.  You got another package from your mom.
Hey thanks for saving my butt today. Like I said I'll pay you back as soon as I can. She opens the package. And pulls out a red blazer.
No problem. But you should always put gas in when it gets to a quarter tank. Especially cause you have such a shitty car.
Thanks. Can I ask you a question? What do you think of Vegas?
Ooo. Let me turn this off. Vegas is a black hole but I must have it in my life. Does that make sense?
I'm just asking because some of the girls are talking about going for Lillia's bachelorette party and I've never been.
Oh no. Now I don't know about weddings. When you go on a bachelorette, does the bride pay?
No, everyone pays for themselves. And you pay for the bride.
Ok, I'm gonna say no. You cannot afford that. Vegas is not cheap. Airfare, hotels, food, cars, drinks, clubs, show tickets. Remember this morning? You cannot afford Vegas.
Well, I could save up for it.
No, you need to win a contest to go to Vegas/You had gum for lunch yesterday. Ooh, Night Moves. Can I have this? A lightbulb goes off in Annie's head. Steve holds the blazer out and reads the tag.
Told you I'd pay you back! Annie runs into her room. She sits down at the computer and begins typing feverishly. We see these words: Dear bridal party, great idea, bachelorette party, Florida, Sea World!, Free place to stay!. She presses send, and is very pleased. The phone immediately rings.
Hello?
Hi.
Hi.
Hiiiii.
Hi Helen. Helen is dressed in cream under a cream blanket. All around her is a ridiculous amount of white glowing candles. There are too many flames.
I just got your e-mail. Um...Sea World?
Well it's not just Sea World. It's a weekend in Florida. See, when Lillian and I were kids we went there and she loved it and has always talked about going back. Ask Dougie. I think it would really mean a lot to her. We could stay at my Dad's house, he won't even be there. Then we could go out at night and got to the beach and then Sea World on one of the days.
But a bachelorette at Sea World?
Like I said, Sea World would just be a part of it.
Well, I have been talking to the other girls, and I was thinking we should go to Las Vegas! Annie's other line rings.
Oh, can you hold on? That's my other line. She clicks over.
Hello?
Hi, Annie. It's Becca. Becca, in her shabby-chic home office paints a front porch sign that says The Whitman's
I was just looking at your e-mail, yo're so cute. Sea World. What about Turkey? That's where we went for for MY bachelorette.
Oh well, Turkey's really far away.
It's super old though! They have awesome restaurants. It's very exotic. Have you ever seen Aladdin? It totally looks like that.
Hang on... Annie clicks back over to Helen.
Helen, I'm sorry can I call you back?
When?
Just a few minutes. I'll call you back. Annie clicks over.
Becca?
Hi. You know, if you wanna go some place closer than Turkey. Helen JUST e-mailed me about going to Vegas.
Oh, I don't know. Everybody always goes to Vegas. It seems just cliche to me.
I never get sick of it. I love blackjack. I have a system. Annie's other line.
Oh, my other line's ringing. Can I call you back?
When?
Soon. Annie clicks over.
Hello?
Annie, it's Dana!
Of course it is.. Dana is on her porch swing drinking lemonade.
I love your idea about Sea World.
Really?
Yeah, but then Helen just called me and said we should go to Vegas.
But Vegas is so hot, don't you think? It's like, hot and dry. People get sick there all the time.
I haven't had that experience. My skin always clears up there.
Yeah, I just think it's probably not-- Hold on.  Hello?
Annie, it's Megan. Megan is at work, in front of a wall of computer and television screens. It is a technical haven, looks like
I can't talk right now, but I was thinking for the bachelorette, something more along the lines of a personal challenge weekend. Have you ever heard of the Nevada Project?
No. Leslie in her Sopranos style living room on a treadmill. Her kids run around.
I gotta be honest. I've been married for nine years, this may be the last bachelorette party of my career and I want the sweaty nuggets of a gay man pounding me in the face at some point during this trip. I'll pay whatever I have to pay.  Tyler stop it, put that back! Paul!
Vegas has these party busses that have flat screens in them and dance floors--
Or we could take hummer limos around everywhere.
That sounds really expensive.
Oh but it's gonna be so much fun! Besides money shouldn't be a problem if Lillian's our friend.
Oh no, no, I was just thinking about everyone else. That's all I'm saying.
What I'm saying is, they drop you off in the middle of the desert. You have to kill your own food and find your way back. Not everyone makes it. Seriously.
Seriously. I want balls in my face.
So I think Vegas is a good idea.
I agree with Helen. Vegas.
Oh, you know what else is in Nevada? Vegas!
Balls. Vegas.
Vegas it is.
Holy Shit Annie! We're goin' to Vegas!
 No can do, I need all my shifts. 'm trying to save up and take my lady to Maui.
Please, one day a week, just for a little while. I've already asked everybody else. I really need the money.
Sorry. My hands are tied. Sharita's got my dick in a chip-clip.
That's alright. I understand.
Mmm. Mm. These are the best peanut butter titties you ever made.
They're called peanut butter kisses.
That's not what they look like.
Here we are. The city of lust. Annie, do you know how many men are looking for trouble in this town right now? We are gonna nail it down. We should tell everybody we're twins cause guys looking up with twins!
Yeah, I've heard that. Ok everybody! You guys, hey we're here, we're in Vegas! Woo! Lillian walks up.
Annie, come here. Why didn't you tell me you weren't sitting with us?
Oh, it's no big deal. I didn't want to blow all my money on a first class ticket. I'm here though, right?!
I'm so excited!
Ok, you guys, gather around. Welcome to Lillian's bachelorette party! We should probably get a bunch of cabs and head to our beautiful hotel, The New Marquis Royal Suites... As Annie's talking, a limo pulls up behind her. The New Marquis Royal Suites.
Lillian, look what's happening.
Oh my God. You guys, is this for us?!
I got a limo from the hotel. We're in Vegas! Yaaaay!! They all pile into the limo, excitedly talking.
Ok, everyone just get in the car. Got a ride to the hotel. It's taken care of.
Sit by me, Annie!
This hotel is amazing! You guys!
Come on Lillian, you're staying with me in the master suite. It's all set.
Oh! Okay! Then party in room 812 in one hour!
Uh! Shoot! I left my sunglasses downstairs. Ugh! Where's my head?
Hi, I have a reservation for Walker. RICK, an East Indian man, stands behind the desk in front of a large portrait of himself, posed exactly as he is now, with the same outfit. He holds the pose, smiling.
Okay, two nights?
Yes. Rick waits for her to notice the painting, but she never does.
Do you want towels?
Yes.
Do you need sheets?
Yes.
No pillow though, ok? Annie just stares at him.
Oh my God.
Oh my gosh, I can't believe this.
He-llo Vegas!
Hello cat.
EMPTY_LINE
Oooh, Annie's here!
Wooooooh!
Isn't this amazing? Lillian runs over and hugs Annie, wearing a condom veil and drinking out of a penis straw.
Annie! I wanna see a drink in your hand in one minute! Lillian pulls Annie into the room. Helen is getting off of the phone.
Ok you guys, change of plans. The Velour Cobra had an opening at 9 so I got us a dinner reservation. Isn't that radical?
Woohooo/Ooooh/Alright!
Oh. Yeah. Cool. Alright Everyone raises their glasses. The night has begun.
Okay, mine was...great, got it. Becca scoots in next to her.
Annie, I didn't get a chance to ask you, how was your date with Mike? Give me all the details.
Oh, um, we had dinner.
Do you think you'll go out with him again? He told Kevin he thought you were really great and hot.
Hey wha's the damage down there?
Oh, I got it right here, I figured out what I owe so, should I just pass it around?
Why don't we just all split it? It's so much easier.
Yeah/Just split it/Who cares?
Yeah, it's probably just easier...just split it.
Here, let me see it. Ok.. .It's a hundred each plus tip.
I had soup and ice water.
Plus we're paying for Lillian...everyone just put $125.
No alcohol...or any real food.
It'll all even out by the end of the night.
How does it even out? How does that happen? Everyone, including Annie, puts in their money. Helen moves over to Annie.
Thank you everybody!!
Annie, don't tell Lillian, it's a surprise.
My friend Sean Michael works for a promotional company and they're having this big event tonight at Tara Rei's stepbrother's Club, Sacrifice.
Really?!
I think it should be our first stop. H's reserving seats for us in the VIP section. It's a $150 cover and there's a one bottle champagne minimum of $750 per table, he said people from the Real World go in there all the time.
I thought we were going to the Jungle Lounge after this.
We are. After that.
Oh...um...wow. Awesome. Here's the thing I was going to stop by the hotel, the Marquis Suites. I think I ate something weird on the plane probably, my stomac's not right.
Oh, well we're only gonna be there for an hour or so, you can just meet up with us after.
Okay. Perfect.
I'll just text you when we're getting ready to leave. I hope you feel better. Lillian comes up already a little tipsy.
Ok, Leslie spilled the beans. Le's get our asses over to Sacrifice. What are we waiting for? Wooooooo! Lillian looks at Helen's legs.
Whoa whoa. Helen, turn around. Are those those Ransom Jeans?
Don't tell Perry I bought them,I ordered them from New York. They're insanely expensive. But I gotta tell you guys the compliments I get on my ass make them worth every penny. She sticks her butt out. Lillian slaps it and all the girls laugh. She is the life of the party.
Oh my God, Annie our song! Wher's Annie?
What?!
Where's Annie?!
I don't know! Where's Annie!
What?!!
Where's Annie!
She's meeting us later!!!
Oh. She's meeting us there!
Why!?
I don't know! Why?
Annie HAS DIARRHEA!!
Is she okay?! Should I call her!?
She's fine! She's gonna meet us in an hour, it's all set! (to the other girls]
No, no, no wait. Wait.  Hey, will you roll for me? Can she roll for me?
Only if she's playing.
Me? What do I have to roll?
Anything but a seven or eleven, as many times as you can. What's your name?
Annie.
I'm Dave. This is Brian, Brian and Mark. Ok Annie, do your thing. Annie rolls a four. The guys all cheer.
Yeah! Four! Annie rolls again, another four. She laughs.
Yeah, four! Holy shit, two fours. One more time, third time's a charm! Annie rolls again. Another four. She ca't believe it!
Four! Ahhhhhhhhh!
Annie! Annie! Annie! Annie gets a text message.
Oh, hold on. You guys, my phone.
No cell phones at the tables m'am. Its a casino rule.
I'll go outside then.
No, you gotta play the game out. You have to finish your roll. She continues to roll all fours. The guys scream.
Ok, guys put me down, put me down. Whoa, that's my breast.
Sorry. She reads a text message from Helen. We're leaving Sacrifice. It's boring. Meet us at the Jungle Lounge
It was nice meeting you guys. I gotta go.
What do you mean? Where are you going?
I'm here with a bunch of friends and 'm supposed to meet them at this club.
We love clubs! We'll come with you.
Come on, we'll get your cab.
Oh, Ok. As the cab drives away, we hear:
Dude, we gotta get Brian some food asap. I've seen that look before.
You guys almost done?
Sorry we haven't eaten all day.
I have NEVER seen a drive-thru line like that dude.
It's because of the concert. They continue eating.
The cab is pulled over, all the guys are outside, peeing. Annie gets a text from Lillian. The Jungle Lounge is awesome! We need to dance. P.S. It's RAINING in here! WHERE ARE YOU? Xoxo Lil She texts back, On my way!
A huge fist fight is going on in the car, yelling etc.
Traffic has stopped.
How much further?
Do you think I know? How do you think I know?
Oh, shit. We can't go into this place. We got kicked out last night.
Hey, what'd I tell you guys?!!!
Whoa, it's ok, we're just goin next door!
Oh, Annie, here's your cut of the craps money. Eight hundred bones.
For me?
You won big for us tonight. Buy your friends a round of drinks and come next door after.
Yeah, bring your friends.
Bye guys.
The Roller!!!
Woohoo/Yeah/ The Roller!/Annie! They all high five. Annie turns to bouncer.
Hi. One please?
60 bucks.
Here ya go.
Annie!
Hello!?
Are you ok?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm here! Where are you?!
What do you mean here, where?
I'm at the Jungle Lounge, where are you guys? This place is huge!
You're where?
The club!
Listen I can't hear you! We had to leave the Jungle Lounge, Becca--
What?!
Meet us at the--
Hello?!!
Me Tarzan, you Jane. It's time for the dance spotlight. If it lands on you, you gotta shake it! The spotlight immediately lands on a soaking wet Annie. She dances very angrily. Jungle dancers dance very close to her and put vines around her neck.
Yeah, she's back/ the Roller!/ Yeah!
What happened to you?
I don't even know.
Roller, I can't stand seeing you like this. (to bartender] Get this fine lady a shot!
I'll have two lemon drops.
That's what I'm saying. Some people have everything and others have just little bits of things. It's not fair. I don't get it.....I mean I think I hate Helen.
I hate Helen.
That is the sexiest think anyon's ever said.
I hate Helen.
Hey.
Hi. Sorry I fell asleep while we were making out. I guess I was pretty tired.
Its ok. Sorry I gave you a hickey.
Oh shit. There's a knock at the door. Annie opens it to reveal NICOLE, , pretty and sweet.
Is Dave here?
Nicole!? Hey, Nic.
This is a surprise.
Dude, I'm sorry. She made us bring her here.
She said you have her fake I.D..
Yeah and I couldn't go anywhere last night. I tried calling you fifty fucking times. And YOU? You were what, hooking up with this fossil?!
First of all-
Shut the fuck up or I will kick your ass bitch.
Ok, that is not nice.
And what are you forty?
No, I'm in my low thirties...(under her breath) and you could never kick my ass.
What did you say?!
You heard me. Annie immediately gets punched in the face. Annie is shocked and swings back, hitting Nicole in the face. She's proud of herself. Nicole's two friends enter and jump on Annie. HUGE GIRL FIGHT.
Baker Community College bitch!
Annie!
Whoa. What are you, going to a rodeo?
That's hilarious.
Annie, you missed it. I scammed all night last night. I met this guy named Darwin. He works for Cingular. He had a friend.
What happened to your face?
Yeah, why are you wearing all that makeup?
It's covering up bruises, cuts and a hickey. I got into fight with a community college student and her friends because I spent the night with her boyfriend after spending the entire night trying to find you.
What?!
Forget it.
I was trying to find YOU. I tried to call you all night!
Well, I-(to Lil} Can I talk to you for a minute? Annie takes Lillian away.
What is going on? You told Helen you were sick.
I wasn't sick. Helen told you that because... I couldn't afford to go with you guys.
Why didn't you say something?--
Lillian, we're going to be late for our honey facials.
Helen, can you just give us a minute?
I'm just saying, we're gonna be late. I don't wanna be rude.
That's funny. You know what? As the Maid of honor, which is what I am and what you are not, I am asking you to just give us a minute.
Excuse me Annie.
No, excuse me!
Annie take it easy.
I need to take it easy?
Annie, if it makes you feel any better (getting emotional] I got slapped last night.
Here we go...
By this huge girl. She was a working in the bathroom. I just... I didn't cut in line. I didn't! She chased me!
Becca it's over.
Annie, she looked like Popeye.
She lives here! She lives in Vegas.
You're not going to run into her. Just shut-up about it.
Guys stop! Please! Annie, I'm so sorry about last night. I feel horrible. I want to hear everything that happened. Tonight, you're not leaving my side. We're hittin' the strip club all of us and we're going to put this shit behind us. Okay?! The girls agree. Dana rubs her arm.
Oh your arm does not still hurt.
What can I get you ladies?
First of all , we're gonna need some ones over here. Here's a hundred. Keep twenty for yourself.
Oooh, Ann! A siren goes off.
looking for someone. The room goes wild.
Leslie, your missing it.
Don't talk to me. Nobody talk to me. Leslie has her hands on the bare ass of a stripper who is dancing in her face. Stripper #2 appears.
Get her! Get her!!
Stripper #2 pulls Annie up to the stage, lays her on the ground and simulates sex with her. Standing above her, pulls his chaps off. We see that his balls are not all the way tucked into his g-string. The girls cringe. As he stands above her, in slow motion, we see a bead of sweat leave his balls and fly into Anni's open laughing mouth. She dry heaves. The stripper is oblivious, goes to another girl. Lillian and Annie roll around on the ground laughing.
I need some gum.
That was disgusting! I'm so glad I'm married.
It was awesome!
I got a picture of the balls. I got it!
. You lucky bitch.
Only you Annie. Hands down, best moment of the weekend. Annie finally feels a part of the group.
Oh look, there's your boyfriend.
Ew, he's like 65. Ok, look Lillian that's you.
Oh my God. You know who that actually looks like? Remember when we went to Miami and we had to rent towels--
Ew, at that beach, that weird beach!
And that lady came up to us wearing that mesh top!
She was crazy. Annie sinks. A flight attendant appears.
Excuse me. Hi.
Hi.
I'm sorry, you can't be up here. You have to go back to coach.
I was just stretching my legs.
That's not true. Annie stares at her. The flight attendant holds out her hand for Annie to grab.
Come on...it's ok, c'mon. C'mon.
Ok, that's going to be seventy -five dollars.
What?
Twenty-five dollars a day. Three days. Seventy -five dollars.
I thought it was seven.
Oh, hmm mm. That's for this lot, you parked in this lot. The lots are exactly the same, separated by a white line. Annie empties her wallet, her poker winnings are gone.
Oh, I know what's going on. You're jealous of that Helen girl.
Excuse me? No, I'm not.
If you say so.
I'm telling you I am not jealous of Helen, okay? She's tall and thin and rich and pretty. They both laugh.
Oh come on, you know you got it goin' on...
Oh yeah, I got it goin' on...
You're right, you don't.
Thanks a lot. They nudge each other. He accidentally nudges her off the car.
Sorry! Now Annie is back in her running car.
Have a good rest of your shift.
Actually, I'm heading home. Got my sister staying with me for a few days. Sh's been thinking of divorcing of her husband.
Oh. Sorry.
He had an affair and they've got kids so it's complicated.
Hmm. Sounds familiar.
My sister is a hell of a woman, you know? And her husband is- you know what I think cheating is? It's weak. It's a weak person that cheats. Something clicks with Annie, she sees him in a new light.
No, no. Um, I feel the same way. Um, anyway um, maybe I'll drive by you next week. I have to make this drive again...so... She tries to flirt a little, pulls her hair back. He sees her hickey!!!! She starts itching her arm, still flirting and laughing.
Ugh, great, I think I was allergic to the soap at the hotel. Ahhhhh.
Yeah. I should go..now. Don't forget to call my friend about those tail lights. They're really starting to bug me.
I promise. Ok, well, have a good weekend.
You too. He abruptly walks back to his car. She drives away confused.
Well, I've got good news for you. You're going to live. Hahahah. It's not an allergic reaction though.
Oh, that's good.
You've got body lice.
Oh.
Have you recently come in contact with or slept anywhere that you think you might
I know where I got it.
You're gonna have to wash every fabric in your apartment and I'll give you a topical cream that should knock it out pretty quick. I've got some samples.
I'm so sorry. I was at our travel agen's trying to figure out how to get my da's family out here, they all have to fly at different times, uggh. What's that on your arms? She sees some of Annie's lice medicine motion.
Huh? Oh...I did a face mask. I must have gotten some on me and didn't rinse it.
Oh shit, I'm sorry, I have to check one thing really quick. When is my hair consultation? Lillian frantically looks through her calender.
Listen, I want to talk to you about--
Oh no.
What's wrong?
I knew it. I'm going to have my period on my wedding day...and my honeymoon!
It's ok. I mean it's not like it's your first time doing it.
It's our wedding night though!
You can still have sex, just put a towel down in the bed.
I can't believe this. This sucks. Oh, Annie I wanted to ask you. Do you think for the cocktail party before the reception we should have a string trio or a horn trio?
Can you just realize what you just asked me right now?
What?
You just said a string trio or horn trio. I thought you didn't want anything fancy, you know, just keep it simple. Not a big deal.
I know but now that I'm planning everything it's just...I wanna do it right. It's once in a life time. It's my wedding. Lillian's phone rings.
Ugh! It's Dougie's Mom. She's mad at me because I won't let her invite everyone from her work. Oh! That reminds me. If you're not going to bring anybody, will you let me know? I gotta free up some spots. (into phone] Hello? Lillian walks away with the phone. Annie is speechless.
Helen.
Annie? Where are you? Inside a truck?
No, I'm doing laundry, what's up?
Annie, the shower needs to happen soon. We haven't heard from you and everyone is-
I know. I know. I'm trying to--
Annie can I dialog openly with you? I know you're having some financial trouble and I think it would be best if I did the shower. Now before you say anything, let me say that showers can be very expensive and I think what's important here is what's best for Lillian.
Wow.
You don't have to give me an answer now
You should have it. You should have it.
Great. Well, I'll definitely need some help.
Ok?
Could you bring the cookies? Annie hangs up, looks at her laundry piles. Pissed.
Excuse me!! A snotty thirteen year old, valley-type, rich girl stands at Annie's counter with an iced coffee chewing gum.
I'm looking for a birthday gift for my best friend.
Your best friend?
Yeah.
For now.
(sip] What do you mean?
Well, what's gonna happen when you get older? Did you ever think of that? What about when she makes new friends and they're more successful than you are? Girl stares annoyingly, chewing and sipping.
Huh? And they buy her facials and designer dresses for cheap and yo're stuck selling jewelry to teenagers wh's outfit cost more than your rent?
Ummm....you're weird.
You're stupid.
You have no chin.
You're gonna be a slut in high school.
You are an old, single loser who has no friends, works in a jewelry store, colors her own hair, and will never know the feeling of owning a luxury car.
(quietly] You. Little. Cunt. The girls eyes widen. The camera pans to show that the girl's dad and Donna have been there the whole time.
Bye.
You know, I knew a girl once. Karen Stippleton. She was really something. The life of the party, a concert pianist, she had naturally curly hair, and skin black as night. But one evening at a dinner party I walked in on her in the bathroom putting a vile of cocaine up her buttocks and last I heard, she was playing the saxophone outside of a drug store. And I'm gonna say something to you I should have told her. Don't waste your life. Find out what your gifts are and use them. Donna hugs Annie, then leaves her in the break room.
Ooh, another package from your mom?
Yep. It is a beautiful pink and white striped box with her name and address in calligraphy. When Annie opens the lid, Canon in D plays and a real butterfly flies out.
On one side of the box, there is a beautiful sculpture of Lillian and Dougie as Bride and Groom, a candle with Lillian's face printed on it and some chocolates. Annie takes the invitation out, opens it quickly.
Are you kidding me? The invitation reads:
Please join us for a Parisian Brunch at the home of Helen Harris III to celebrate the marriage of Lillian Donovan and Douglas Price. Let us shower Lillian with gifts and love. Date: Sunday the 20th. Time: 2:00 post meridian. Address and phone number below. Responde S'il Vous Plait. Yay! Annie picks up the phone, calls the R.S.V.P. number. Canon in D. plays. and a recorded message begins.
Hello. This is Helen. You have reached the Responde S'il Vous Plait line for Lillian's shower.
You have got to be kidding me.
Please listen to all of the following menu options before making your selection. If you would like to reply oui, press one. To reply no, press two. For where the bride and groom are registered, press three. If you require a vegetarian meal. Press 4. If you are vegan, press 5. A dairy free meal, press 6. Kosher meals will not be available. For the Lillian and Dougie story, narrated by me, please press 7. To hear a twenty-four hour wedding music mix, press 8, put your phone on speaker, light the Atmospheria candle you've just received and think about the eternal union that is marriage. I'm Helen Harris IV, and this is me saying au revoir! But before I do, here's a message from SUSAN SARANDON!
Hello, I'm Susan Sarandon, the movie star. I just wanted to say congratulations to Lillian and Dougie. Even though I don't believe in marriage, I do believe in the church of basebal. Just kidding. That's a line from my movie Bull Durham. I- Annie hangs up quickly.
Is there an animal over there?
No, it's a C.D. She rolls over and turns it off.
So, I'm flying straight to O'Hare the day of the shower cause I wanna get my hair done. Did you see that invitation? I didn't get the significance of the dead butterfly, but it looks like w're gonna have fun.
I'm not.
Oh, c'mon.
I already know what it's gonna be like. It's gonna be uncomfortable and weird...I don't wanna go.
Sweetie, listen to yourself. You ca't let her new friends get in the way of your being a part of one of the best days of Lil's life. NO way. You have a history with her that no one else has. So you walk into that party knowing that.
Oh my God. She turns into the gates of Whitewater Estates. There is, a life-size sculpture of a bride and groom. As she gets closer, she sees they are real life models. They smile at Annie, wink at her and wave her by. At the next stop sign, a butler appears with a tray.
Are you a guest of Helen Harris?
Yes.
The shower is one mile away. He hands her a pink lemonade.
I don't have a cup-holder. As she's driving, little pink things start to fly beside her car.
One flies in her car. They're Rose petals! Annie's shitty car drives down a road covered with Rose petals. At the driveway, she is greeted by a valet in a pink bow-tie and beret. As she reaches for her gift from the passenger seat, another valet opens that door and take it.
This will be placed in the gift room for you madame. He reaches for the cookies she made, and she stops him.
I'll take those.
Would you like an assisted ride to the main house?
Do I have to? An annoyed Annie arrives at the house on the horse with the man leading her on foot, holding the cookies. She dismounts. The front door is swung open by two attendants. As she enters the mansion, groups of girls pass by her...
This is the most amazing shower 've ever been to/Can you believe this?/What a lucky bride/What a good friend... Helen's house is ALL cream and white with gold. Couches are puffy, etc. Annie walks to the backyard. We hear French standards. Beautiful tables are set. Swans and bunnies milling about. Attendants ready to serve. In the middle of everything stands an eight foot tall round sign that says Lillian and Dougie in puffy pink cursive. A waiter offers Annie champagne. She takes it.
Do you believe this shit? Annie is still staring at the sign.
That's a big cookie huh.
Where? They point to the sign. Annie walks closer to see it is indeed a huge cookie.
See. Sugar cookie.
It's even better if you dip it in the chocolate. REVEAL a glorious four tiered chocolate fountain. Girls are around it dipping strawberries and pieces of the big cookie, laughing. Helen is there taking their praise. Annie is pissed and plops her tupperware of cookies on a nearby table.
Annieee!!! Lillian runs to her.
Can you believe this?
Lillian!
Coming Mom! I gotta go say hi to my aunts. She leaves and Helen appears out of nowhere again.
Hi Annie!
Beautiful party.
Oh, it's nothing....so...Just make yourself at home. Enjoy!
Thanks.  Asshole.
What did you say?
I said I love this shower, and i's amazing. I said all that. Annie leaves. Two hip hop dancers wearing pink berets approach Helen and jam out in her face.
OK, not me, NOT ME! The GUESTS. Hip hop dance with the GUESTS!
looking.
face super imposed over them. On the counter is a framed photo of Helen, soft lit, posed with her hand gently
face. She also sees a photo of Helen and Lillian from Vegas on the plane. Happy. As Annie leaves, she runs into her Mom, wh's new hairstyle is a bit overdone.
Mom. Hi! They hug.
Wow! You look great.
Thank you sweetheart.  I wish Barb could see me now.
Not today Mom.
You're right. Well I'm happy to see you! I'll see you out there. I need to wash the horse off my hands. Mom goes into the bathroom. Megan approaches.
Annie, did you see the party favors?
I'm sure they're perfect and amazing.
They're dogs!
What?
Yeah. And they're wrapped up like presents. They said we have to wait until we leave but I cant stop thinking about them. I gotta go tell Lillian.
attention by microphone.
Hello ladies. Bonjour. (french sentence)Yay! Welcome. I am your host Helen, a bridesmaid in Lillian's wedding. I want you all to have a wonderful time. Eat, drink, please have some cookie! She laughs and then becomes very serious.
Lillian. Today's your day. I'd like to make a beautiful toast, You are pretty, fun, sweet, look at all of your friends. Girlpower! Everyone enjoy your lunch, served along with the musical stylings of...The LILLIANETTE'S!!! A quartet, all in pink and white and harmonize. Lillian, Lillian, Lillian, Lillian! When Lillian was a little girl... Judy claps and enjoys the music. She leans over to Annie.
I don't know what's going on honey. The shower is a hit.
Everyone it's game time! Please take your piece of paper, put it on top of your head, and with your other hand try to draw what Lillian and Dougie's first baby is going to look like!!! Ready? GO! Everyone draws, giggles, looks at their stupid drawings, laughing. Annie cheats and draws it on her lap.
And the winner is...Annie? Dana holds up a perfectly realistic drawing of a baby.
Yeah, that's mine. Thank you.
Girls spin a blind-folded 86 year old ELLIE around 3 times, Then they swing her holding her hands and feet.
One... two...three! Annie looks confused. They throw Ellie onto a huge pile of pillows. This is a terrible game.
Find the veil! C'mon Ellie! Come on Look! You can do it! It's right there! Ellie feels around in the huge pile of pillows. She finds the veil, holds it up in victory and then falls down from dizziness.
YAAAAY! YOU DID IT! WoooHoo!
#9. What is Lillian's favorite ice cream flavor? Write it down...quickly.
 Ew. Kinda smells funny in here. Doesn't it? Smells bad. This house has a weird smell.
OK, last one. For the big prize. #10. What is the craziest place Lillian and Dougie....? Helen strongly hints with a weird smile instead of saying, ...had sex? Shower Girls Ooooh and Ahhhh.
Wow, looks like someone's a pervert. It's none of my business. She's gross.
I'm putting a blue bead on this advice necklace to represent the ocean. It may not always be smooth sailing but you can ride the waves together. Dana cries and takes a picture. Everyone applauds,
The ocean's are really polluted right now. Its not something to joke about.
Oh! My towels! Thank you Dana.
I just wanted to get you something you could use everyday and something pretty. Dana takes a picture, Lillian grabs another box, giddy.
Annie.  Oh, our mugs! Thank you Annie.
Well, you registered for 'em so thank yourself, you picked them out. I did't do anything...
This one's from me. Helen hands Lillian her gift. Lil opens it and holds up beautiful lingerie.
Oooo/Ahhhhh etc.
Ooh, brothel gear...
(sotto] It's disgusting. Here Mom's here.
Wait, what's this? Lillian pulls out an envelope.
Wow, cash. Kinda tacky. Lillian opens the envelope.
Oh my God. Helen. Lillian holds up the tickets.
Honey what are they?
Two first class tickets to Sea World. How did you--
Are you fucking kidding me?
Annie!
Annie! What is going on with you?
Nothing have fun at Sea World.
Why don't we go in the other room and--
Shut up you ridiculous person, you a sneaky little cream and white cashmere--.
Annie. Everyone I am so sorry, I really don't know what you mean.
I think you do. Horses? Sculptures? Posters? Look at this stupid house! This stupid marshmallow puffy furniture!  And look at that cookie! Would you please everyone! Speaking of that cookie. I never got a piece! Annie marches into the back yard.
(shouting, we see her through the large
Did you honestly think 30 women were gonna finish this?! You know what!? 'll help you out! She tries to take down the cookie and struggles with it. We watch her from the house. Fall over with the cookie, she runs over to the chocolate fountain and tries to tip it over, it's obviously too heavy. She tries to empty it with her hands onto the ground.
Mmmmm. Nothing says friendship like a thousand gallons of hot unsanitary chocolate! Hello swan, are you having fun? Did you enjoy the hip-hop dancers?
I actually thought I wanted to be like you...and you and YOU, to be a part of this world. That's not who I am. I make bad choices. I'm broke, I lost my stupid job, I'm thirty two years old and I still answer booty calls. I don't like Mike Donahue cause he  on our date. I have a single black hair that grows out of my chin and I can't wear white t-shirts cause something about my sweat turns the pits yellow! AND you know when we were in Vegas? When you were all staying at your luxury hotel? I was staying at Hotel RICK where got BODY LICE! So Helen, you can have the coveted Maid of Honor title. You can have it all wrapped up in a big pink obnoxious musical box! Because all its brought me is a big pain in my ass. Congratulations! Annie leaves and Lillian runs after her.
Annie stop! I don't know what's going on.
Well let me fill you in. Ever since you got engaged, my life has turned to shit.
I'm sorry the the happiest time in my life has brought you so much misery. Do you know how selfish that sounds?
I'm selfish? You're the one that's been so wrapped up in all this. Designer dressed, extravagant hotels, this shower, this is not you!
This is my wedding and you've made it all about you.
Well at least my friendship's not for sale. This hangs in the air. Annie storms off. Lillian storms back inside.
Do you think she still has body lice?
Anyone else?! Anyone else have something they wanna say to me?! Dana can't contain herself.
I got my chin done! Becca stands up.
Kevin smokes pot! Leslie stands up.
I'm pregnant! Megan stands up.
I took two dogs already. There in the back of my van!
Thank you! Her car won't start. Trying to keep it together, she grabs her running shoes from the back seat and storms down the highway, trying not to cry. A cop car pulls next to her. I's Rhodes.
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.
Yes. Taillights. I know!
You should've taken it to my friend-
I KNOW! Yes, you're friend! But I didn't ok?! I didn't get them fixed! I don't--
Whoa. Don't take it out on me. This is your fault.
HE hit ME!
You had no taillights! You did't get them fixed! You don't get to blame anyoe else. It's your fault. Annie starts to walk away.
Where you going?! Annie keeps walking.
Oh, you're going to walk fifteen miles?! Another WISE decision!
I know that you not taking responsibility is why we're standing out here! YOU did not make an effort to fix that problem. This hits Annie. Rhodes is physically worked up.
Why are you yelling at me?!
It's dangerous! You're putting your life, and others in danger!
I'm! Sorry! He calms down.
Look, all I know, is that you're kinda crazy. You're always stressed out or late, complaining about something, and now you're yelling at me! And for some reason, all I've ever wanted to do is ask you on a date.
Well save yourself the trouble, and don't.
Yeah, I'm not much of a hickey guy anyway. Annie remembers her hickey. He saw it?!
Well, I have said no anyway.
Well, then you have yourself a good night ma'am. Annie regrets that. He drives away leaving her there. She is alone.
Rhodes told me a while back you might be stopping in. I'm Bill Cozbi.
Oh, hi.
I was beginning to think we'd never see ya.
Yeah, I know. I'm irresponsible.
Nah, no one likes taking care of that stuff. But you are going to have to leave your car here for a week or so.
A week?
So you kind of had a bad time at the wedding shower?
Yes I did. Everything's just... She starts crying. Steve hands her a tissue from the middle console.
I'm sorry, I just--this has been a really shitty day.
Yeah. Ok, don't get mad at me, but it seems like you have a lot of those.
Yes I do! Right? Thank you.
Have you considered the idea that maybe, possibly, perhaps, it's you that makes them shitty? Annie stares at him.
I'm just saying, maybe it's your attitude.
This is not about attitude. It's just the facts! My life hasn't turned it out the way I expected. I don't have any of those things that gives a person points in the world.
I think that might be your problem. I think you read too many of those magazines. You don't need things to be someone. Tyra said that. Tyra Banks.
Lillian. She doesn't even know what to say, so she doesn't answer.
Is anyone sitting here?
No. The lady sits next to Annie and smiles at her.
Hey Annie.
Oh, hey Ted. You're in town.
Yeah, yeah. Listen I'm going out tonight but I should be home around 11, you wanna come over?
Really? Ok, sure. Ted smiles at her. Annie stops herself.
Wait no. No. No. I don't think I do. Because answering your booty calls and having you kick me out after a night of no-strings-attached sex doesn't feel good. NO girls feel good after that and if they say they do they're LYING. But it's not your fault. Its me. It's me. Have a great life. And you can keep the plant. Annie grabs her stuff and leaves.
names cut out and being placed at different tables. Her mom, Laurie, Helen, and two women argue about the seating chart. Lillian looks distraught.
Well, I can't think of anything else to tell you. Did you have any questions?
No, I think we've covered everything. I'm really excited and thank you. Annie gathers her things.
I'll see you next Monday. What time do I start?
Four a.m. Annie is a little surprised. Ti's smiling.
You'll get used to it. Annie smiles back.
I won't be late.
Oh and I wanna try one of those moonpies.
(smiling] Yeah. Ok.
Hi, I'm here to inquire about financial aid. Her cell phone rings.
Take these to the second window.
I'm sorry? Annie's trying to find her phone.
The second window.
Thanks. It's too late, she looks at her phone. It was Lillian. No message. She doesn't call her back.
Parts and labor, we're lookin' at eight hundred dollars. But with your discount...
Discount?
Yeah. Rhodes and I worked out a deal way back when, so, this one's on the house.
Are you serious?
Yep. I owe him big time. He runs background checks on all the guys my daughter dates. There's been a lot of 'em.
You're kidding! If you see him, would you thank him for me and tell him that I'm crazy and I'm sorry. He'll know what you mean.
pull her over. She drives by him again and swerves all over the road. He really wants to pull her over, but he doesn't. She goes back one more time, throws a bunch of trash and diet coke cans out of the window. He still ignores her. She gives up and goes home. 't get to this point until this morning. wanted to see if we're going in the right direction with annie uniting bridesmaids and saving the day.
Ok, you can take Women's Studies or Spanish...oooh The History of Wine. The phone rings.
Hello?
Annie. It's Megan, Becca Leslie, Dana and Helen.
Oh. Hi--
Lillian's missing!
What do you mean she's missing?
We were all supposed to get spray-tans today and she never showed up. No on's heard from her. She could be anywhere, doing anything! She could be ANYWHERE--
Jesus Christ, give me the God damn phone. Leslie grabs the phone from Megan.
Annie, it's Leslie. Look, I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. The weddin's the day after tomorrow, she's been really stressed, so she just probably freaked out and went somewhere. We just want to find her and probably talk her off a ledge. Any ideas?
Um, gosh I..I don't know. Um, I'll come to you guys. I'll be there in an hour and 45 minutes. I wanna help. Annie hangs up, grabs her keys. She stops, comes back and grabs a small paper bag, and runs out the door.
What about the Science of Jazz?
Maybe she's at the park.
The park? Don't be stupid Dana.
Jeez, take it easy.
Well, it's closed is all I'm just saying.
Maybe she flew somewhere. Everyone always hides in Mexico.
I don't think she'd leave the country. Maybe she went to the reservoir.
Why would she go to the reservoir? Its just a big tank of water.
Ernie and I sometimes go for our morning walk there. It's the next best thing to a lake.
Oh my God! I think I know where she is.
How much further?
We're almost there.
I'm think I'm getting carsick.
Is that supposed to be a dig on my driving?
Well you do speed up and slow down a lot.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't take a stunt driving course in Renegade missions.
Why do you always have to be so condescending?
Yeah, its getting really old.
I was being funny!
Well it came out a little mean Helen.
Dana who's side are you on? All the girls start yelling. Helen loses control of the car for a split second and drives off the road hitting something. BOOM! The girls scream!!! She pulls over. All the girls are wide eyed and speechless.
What was that?
Did we hit something!?
Was it a person?
Guys it's just a flat. I've gotten tons of them. Annie goes to get out of the car.
No!/ Annie don't get out!/ It's pitch dark out.
Everybody calm down. I'm calling 911.
You don't call 911 for a flat tire! A huge truck drives by moving their car a little bit. The girls SCREAM!
Guys! We're fine. Helen, put the hazards on. Helen puts them on.
I'm calling AAA.
I'm calling Kevin!
Helen, do you have a jack?
Probably?!
What if we get hit just sitting here? Or kidnapped or chased by an animal?
Dana calm down.
Shit! I don't have any service.
Me neither!
Oh my God! We're gonna die... Annie has had enough and gets out. The tire is definitely flat. She opens Hele's trunk, lifts the bottom (wherever the jack is in an Escalade] She goes up to the window.
Everyone's gotta get out, if you want me to fix this. They complain that its dangerous, i's cold, but they do. Annie puts the jack under car.
So, how can I help?
Hold the flashlight. Leslie and Megan watch as Annie pumps the jack. She really does know what she's doing! The car is raising.
Megan hand me the wrench. Megan hands it to her. Annie starts to unscrew the lug nuts handing them to Megan, with Leslie by her side. Dana and Becca stand with Helen.
That's pretty cool she knows how to do change a tire.
I know. I can't believe she's doing it. Dana and Becca move over to Annie. Helen waits alone.
Just don't scratch anything. The girls are all crouched down to watch Annie in awe.
So what are you doing now?
I'm removing the lug nuts so we can take the tire off.
How does that little thing lift the whole car?
It uses hydraulic power. It gives a human being the lifting capacity of 1.5 to three tons.
How do you know this stuff?
I like cars. There's a real artistry to them.
Are you guys working or talking? We do't have all night.
Annie is doing the best she can Helen. So why don't you just stand over there and be quiet and wait.
Excuse me?! Dana stands. She has had it with Helen.
I said, will you, for once, shut the fuck up!!!?? Dana approaches Helen. The other girls are standing now.
Lillian probably left because of you anyway.
What!?
You're so- bossy! You've been acting like you're in charge this whole time! Do't you realize how much pressure sh's under? You know, Lillian did not want to leave her reception in a unicorn-drawn carriage?! She said That's not me. And you ordered it anyway! You've been pushing her this whole time! Annie was right.
Yeah! Helen glares at Megan.
What are you talking about? The only reason you're even in this wedding is because you're the groom's sister. Weirdo.
I'd rather be the groom's sister than have cameltoe from my $600 pants. We see that Helen has cameltoe. Megan has surprised them.
Why is everyone attacking me? I wasn't the one who caused a huge scene at Lillian's bridal shower and made her cry.
I hate to interrupt this riveting discussion but a really creepy guy in a Trans Am just pulled over. The guy gets out of the car. He is thirty-ish, wears at- shirt with a cat on it and camouflage shorts.
Just changing the tire.
Nope I think we got it. But thank you. He doesn't leave, the girls worriedly look at each other.
Hey! Are those snowflake rims? The guy looks at Megan.
I bet you got a formula 4OO under there?
I'm in the Firebird club.
You ever make it up to the Trans Am Nationals in Dayton? Becca, Dana, Leslie and Helen are huddled together. They talk in a loud whisper.
What's happening? What's happening?
I can hear animals.
Be quiet! The guy is moving closer to Megan.
Remember Smokey and the Bandit?
Why don't you show me what's under the hood? Back at Helen's car. Leslie sneaks over to Annie.
How's it comin'?
Almost there. The guy has lifted up his hood and Mega's looking. He puts his hands on her ass.
Uh... He is really getting aggressive, pushing against her.
Hey take it easy!
Hey what about me? He turns around to be hit with a huge piece of wood by Helen. He falls.
Oh my God!! Annie is frantically releasing the jack.
OK, everybody in the car! Get in! Megan, Helen let's go! All the girls scramble in the car, Helen starts it. Annie is finishing.
Annie get in!
Back away! Or I will shove this Jack so far down your throat you will shit out...your fucking..face!
Get out!
The girls still driving. Megan's eating chips.
Megan I was freaked out when he leaned up against you. That was a pretty gutsy move.
Annie's the one who tried to make him eat a car jack.
Helen hit him over the head with a tree. They all continue talking, Helen and Annie smile.
There it is, turn left up here. Go down the little hill. Ok, that's the driveway. It's dark and very rustic. It's LILLIAN'S LAKE HOUSE FROM THE FLASHBACK. Where Lillian and Dougie met.
God I haven't been here in forever.
The house is right up here. They pull up to a small cottage and get out of the car.
Her car's not here.
Doesn't look like any lights are on.
She's not here. Annie is sitting on the front step, defeated.
I thought she'd be here. I really thought she'd be here. I'm sorry.
Annie, it's ok.
No, it's not. I don't know what happened. I messed everything up. Lillia's not even talking to me. I think I'm so afraid to see what's really happening. Lillian's moving on to this great life and I feel left behind. And know matter how hard I try, I don't fit in to her life now. Everyone is silent.
Annie, Lillian loves you. (beat] I know I haven't made things easy for you.. I don't have a life and I am bored. Perry is always away and I'm constantly alone and she's been there. And I've been a bridesmaid nine times and although I may have implied it, I....I've never been a Maid of Honor. I wanted to make everything special for Lillian because... I don't have a lot of friends. I wanted her to like me better and to impress her, and everyone else. And I'm just good at throwing parties. I always have been. In fact sometimes I think people only ask me to be in their wedding's because of that.
Lillian wouldn't do that. If she asked you to be in her wedding it's because you are her friend. Trust me. Dana is crying and takes a picture. The're both startled by the flash.
I'm sorry about the Sea World tickets.
I'm sorry that when I left the shower I told your neighbors you were shooting a porn.
Oh, I didn't know that you did that.
Oh, well, sorry.
I deserved it.
I must say you do put on some pretty spectacular events.
Well, I'm really rich. They smile.
It is getting pretty late.
What should we do about Lillian?
She'll come home when she's ready.
You okay?
Yeah. Didn't mean to make anyone worry.
It's okay. I really am sorry.
I'm sorry too. I didnt want things to turn out like this. I got so caught up in the frenzy of everything, wanting this one day to be perfect.
Well its easy to get caught up.
And it doesnt help that all my friends hate eachother.
I'm sorry. But it's all good now. We all talked and everythings cool.
Really?!
Yup, Helen and I are best friends now. We're going shopping for cream sweaters tomorrow.
She's really not so bad.
I know.
I just wish the wedding hadnt become about everything and everyone else but me and Dougie. And now, it's become this thing I never wanted. I did want simple. I wanted colored lanterns, twinkly lights and food everywhere. I wanted a DJ to play all those stupid wedding songs.
It's not too late to have those things.
I'm sorry I didn't know all the stuff you were going through too. Annie is clearly sad.
It's fine. I just feel really lost right
Lillian hugs her.
Nothing's going to change.
Oh God dont say that.
I mean between you and me.
You want to come in? Steve's home. This could be your last chance as a single woman.
Ooooo...
Leslie and Paul dancing with two boys trying to join in. They are all happy, he rubs her stomach. Perry and Helen are dancing. They look like they are talking and working things out. He hugs her and kisses her. Lillian and Dougie dance into frame. They are very close. Smiling and kissing. They've never looked happier. She smiles at someone. It's Annie. Annie is watching everyone from the side, smiling also. Steve approaches.
Thanks a lot for bringing me.
Thanks for coming with me. Megan appears on her other side.
Yeah, thanks for bringing him.
Annie is alone, watching everybody. We see the wedding as a whole. It's a beautiful event. Colored lanterns, twinkly lights, food everywhere. Simple, fun...very Lillian.
So when does school start?
A week. I'm scared. I'm gonna be the oldest one there.
So what? Now you can have an affair with your teacher and it won't be gross. They walk down the steps.
Thanks for everything today. Yo've been the best Maid of Honor ever.
Really?
MMM. No. That's not true at all. You were pretty terrible. Today you were good. Annie sees the hotel shuttle.
Oh, I want to catch this shuttle back to the hotel.
You're always gonna be my best friend. They hug goodbye. She runs down the stairs.
I will see YOU in a couple weeks Mrs. Price!
Wait! Wait! Stop! Great. Of course. The shuttle is gone, but there's something that was on the other side of it.
Need a ride ma'am? It's Rhodes, leaning against his car like Jake in sixteen candles. Annie is all smiles and walks up to him.
How did you know I was here?
It was really complicated. I remembered the name of this place, I called them up, told them I was a cop calling on official police business, doing a very big investigation and uh, made them tell me all the weddings they had planned for the next two months with a bride named Lillian. [ALT: I'm a cop] Annie smiles.
Wow. They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.
So, did you get the moonpies?
Yes I did.
Did you like' em?
Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them. They were completely covered in ants.
Ooo, I didn't think about that.
You probably should have put it in a plastic wrap or maybe a foil or something. Tupperware would've worked but then I'd have to get it back to you-I'm gonna kiss you right now so... He walks to her and takes her in his arms. They are about to kiss. Rhodes stops.
I didn't want to miss my chance again.
Annie is walking back to her hotel. A cop car pulls up next to her.
Need a ride ma'am? She turns to see Rhodes driving slowly next to her.
How did you know I was here?
I'm a cop. They're looking at each other, not knowing what to do.
So, did you get the moonpies?
Yes I did.
Did you like' em?
Yeah. No. I couldn't eat them. They were completely covered in ants.
Ooo, I didn't think about that.
The real reason I came here today is that I have something that belongs to you. He opens his hand to reveal the ugly carrot. She smiles. He stops the car and unlocks the passenger door. She gets in. They drive off into the sunset.
