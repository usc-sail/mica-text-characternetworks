Watch out!
How deep are we?
8200 feet. Used to be an old copper mine, Professor, sir.
Helmsley told me that the neutrino count doubled during the last sun eruptions.
Correct, sir. But that is not what worries me...
There was a new solar storm, so strong that the physical reaction got even more severe.
How can that be?
We don't know, Professor, sir.
The neutrinos suddenly act like... microwaves.
I still can't believe that Wilson chose him of all people to run the White House.
Shame he's such a pompous ass.
Somebody mention my name?
 Yes sir... No, sir.
Which one is it?
We were talking about what a great speech you gave tonight. Well done, sir.
It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember that.
 Professor West?
I've been trying to reach you!
Listen, Adrian. The situation is much worse than we thought...
Sir, the President needs to know this.
Helmsley, how long have you been on the job as science advisor?
Four months this week.
I would   say that's enough time to learn that we   have rules here. You'll just have to   wait until the quarterly science   briefing.
If this is about what I said last night, I am truly sorry, sir.
So you didn't like my speech?
Can you please have a look at this, sir? It's really important.
Who wrote this?
An Indian astrophysicist I graduated with from Harvard and Prof. West, the preeminent geologist in the US.
Who else knows about it?
No one, sir.
Let's keep it that way, Helmsley.
Good Morning...
EMPTY_LINE
I hereby present a motion to meet privately with my seven fellow Heads of State, kindly excluding the rest of the delegates.
Mr. Makarenko wishes to have his interpreters present.
Mr. President, judging from the conversations we've had in the past, I can assure you, your English is absolutely fine, for what I have to say.
Six months ago I was made aware of a situation so devastating, that at first, I refused to believe it.  However through the concerted efforts of the brightest scientists of several nations, we have now confirmed its validity.
The world as we know it, will soon come to an end.
 You will have new houses, electricity and running water...
... Some among you will even have the chance to work for the glorious People's Republic of China building the biggest dam project in the world...
I will send you money mother.
Who can read and write?
Who can weld?
Has his Highness had the opportunity to study the dossier?
You must understand I have a very big family. Mister...
Isaacs.
Mister Isaacs, one billion dollars is a lot of money.
I'm afraid the amount is in Euros, your Highness.
Laura, I'm putting a lot of trust in your people. 
There are too many crazy people who could hurt her, Manfred. The World Heritage Foundation has done this all over the world.
And she'll be safe now? Tucked away in the Swiss Alps?
Perfectly safe.
FADE UP
... The mass suicide was discovered by a BBC documentary crew in the ancient Mayan city of Tikal...
... the victims were said to have adhered to the Mayan-Quiche Calender which predicts the end of time to occur on the 21st of December this year, due to the sun's destructive forces...
... Strangely enough, scientific records do support the fact that we are heading for the biggest solar climax in recorded history...
Oh no. Not again.
Hello?... What do you mean? I'm not late. It's not even 10:30...
Damn it!  Kate, I'm on my way... For god's sake...
They're kids, Kate, going on vacation. It's not a doctor's appointment... it's supposed to be fun. You remember that, right? Fun?
... I know it's mosquito season at Yellowstone, Kate. I'll pick some up on the way.
Merrill, we should move back to Wisconsin.
... Those shake-proof coffee mugs are a genius idea, and they just show the true nature of us Californians.
We'll not bow to little inconveniences like these so called `mini-quakes'...
... If you have a funny `mini-quake' story you wanna share, call Lisa & Randy at 1-800...
Jackson, what is this?
Don't call me Jackson, Noah, I'm your father.
Noah! Look! Daddy's got Space-Busters in the car... and Space-Busters 2. Awesome!
So what, you're a chauffeur now? What happened to the temp work?
This is better hours for me. Means I can still write.
Of course.
 Simone, how many times have I told you, we don't do Lipo on Fridays. It's too messy.
Have fun guys. And watch out for those bears.  Nice car.
Noah needs to read twenty pages from his book each day...
... and Lilly has to put these on, before she goes to sleep.
Still?
Jackson, they've been really looking forward to this you know. Don't let them down.
So this time we'll hit the Japs.
So what?
Well Tony, electronics are cheap there and... you could visit your boy Will.
Afternoon ladies...
Are you even listening to me?
Yes unfortunately I am Harry.
I heard from Audrey you're a grandpa now.
Why don't you keep your nose out of my family. You're cramping my style.
He married a Japanese girl - how is that the end of the world? You should at least go see him.
Why? Do you see your boy?
Not as much as I'd like. DC is a long way. But at least we talk.
What about?
Life, how short it is...
What the hell was that?
Laura? They lied to us.
Manfred is that you?
I had my suspicions. I should have said something. They are following me.
Who is?
They may be listening to us too. Laura the Heritage Foundation is a sham. 
What?
The art you collected, it's not in the Alps.
Then where is it?
... After what is going on in La-La- land with all those surface cracks, I told myself: Get your stupid ass to Yellowstone. I don't want to miss all the great fun, when it finally blows...
What happened to the music?
Hang on, sweet pea, let daddy listen to this for a moment...
... There's been government people flying in and out all morning. And trust me, they did not look happy... 
... Folks, always remember, you heard it first from Charlie.
You have to see this.
It's alright Sally.
... Mr. Picard had been the director of the French National Museums for 24 years. As fate would have it his assassination took place in the same Paris tunnel where Princess Diana died in 1997.
I just talked to him, Dad. He told me the world Heritage Foundation is a sham. Is that true?
You knew too? You sleep with me and you didn't say anything?
I can't even look at you. Either of you!
Honey, calm down.
A man was killed! I want the truth Dad. Right now.
Daddy, where are we going?
To a very special place, Lil'bee. It's a lake. A place where mommy and daddy fell in love.  Remember the book I gave you?
I don't want to know where you and mom had sex. I'm not ready for that, Jackson.
I'm your dad, Noah.
Daddy!
This wasn't here before.
Don't you see the signs?
It's fine guys.
It's gone. The whole darn lake is gone. I swear you guys there was a lake here.
Jackson!
It's okay, Noh'.
I'll be with you in a second, Professor.
... And then you climbed over a posted fence? Just like that?
I told you.
Isn't this supposed to be a National Park? There shouldn't be fences. What are you guys doing around here anyway?
We're geologists...
I'll handle this officer. Thank you.
So, where did the lake go?
That's what we're trying to find out. We think this whole area has become potentially unstable. I would advise you to take your kids and leave, Mr...
... Curtis.
Are you by any chance the Jackson Curtis, the author of `Farewell Atlantis'?
 Yeah, that's me.
What a coincidence. I'm reading your book, as we speak... first third, around day 300, when the shuttle loses communication with earth and drifts off into space.
You're one of lucky 422 who bought it.
Actually I didn't buy it. My father gave it to me.
Oh, I see.
Officer, can you return them to the campgrounds, please.  Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Curtis.
He was very nice.
Yes he was, Lil'bee.
What did the government guys tell you?
They think it's not such a good idea to climb over their fences. They feel the area is unstable.
Unstable! Ha-ha! They say its unstable! That's funny...
There are mosquitos in here. Did anybody spray the tent?
We'll get some of that tomorrow. For tonight just put your head under the blankie.
Daddy you said you weren't gonna work on your book.
I'm not Honey, I promise. Are you wearing your pull-ups?
Did mommy buy you that?
No... Gordon gave it to me for my birthday.
Noah. Things like a cell phone have to be discussed in the family.
 What family?
Go to sleep guys.
... You have to immediately inform the President, Mr Anheuser. The readings look much worse than I expected. 
Plus Satnam's neutrino figures from India confirm...
... But you guys said...
We were wrong! By five or six months...
... This is Charlie Frost reporting live from Yellowstone National Park, soon to become the world's largest active volcano.
Hi. Mind if I join you?
I only got a few minutes.
I just heard part of your broadcast... Mind me asking a question? What exactly is it... that will start in Hollywood?
 Actually it's gonna be the whole west coast...
What are you talking about?
The apocalypse, the end of days. The Mayans knew it, the I Ching and the Bible, kind of...
I got to eat... Just check my blog. You can download it for free.
... However, we do take donations. 
In the year 2012 a cataclysmic event will unfold. Caused by an alignment of the planets in our solar system that only happens every 640,000 years... Just imagine the earth as an Orange...
... our sun will begin to emit such extreme amounts of radiation, that the core of the earth will melt - that's the inside part of the Orange, leaving the crust of our planet free to shift.
In 1958, Prof. Hapgood named it `Earth Crust Displacement'...
... and Albert Einstein endorsed it...
The forces of mother nature will be so devastating it will bring an end to this world on winter solstice 12-21-12.
Pretty neat, huh? It's a big hit on YouTube. I did the animation myself.  I know what you're thinking. But all the governments know about this.
If they all knew, don't you think somebody would tell us?
They can't. Just think about it. First the stockmarket would crash...
Then the economy... boom. The dollar... boom. And then the people in the streets...  Boom, boom! Pandemonium, revolution, war! They would never tell us. Beer?
Only if you're some Sheik, Bill Gates, or maybe one of those Russian billionaires do you stand a chance to buy a seat.
A seat?
 They're building spaceships, man.
Oh... I see.
No really... One of my listeners, a geography professor at UTSC, has even figured out where they're building them. He sent me a map.
Well... Charlie, I think I gotta go. My kids are sleeping.
Get them out of Yellowstone, man. It's gonna get ugly here.
Night, Charlie.
Sorry for the delay, folks. But even in times like these, a man has got to eat...
Why don't we make a baby?
Stop it! We're in public.
Honey, I created them. And now suddenly I can't touch them?
You always act strange after he shows up?
Just because I don't care for your arrogant humor doesn't mean I'm acting strange. He is the father of my kids.
Maybe biologically. Can I remind you what that guy did? First you gave up med school to have Noah... Then you practically raise him and Lilly by yourself while he sat glued to a laptop writing that junk.
Some of his stuff is actually... He's published Gordon.
 Yeah, published! You know your mother was right. You've always been drawn to guys with lofty dreams and empty pockets. But not this time right, sweetheart?
Did you see that?
See what?
You know Kate, we have to keep working at this... our relationship. Because I won't end up being just a re-run of you and Jackson.  I mean Honey, I feel like... something is pulling us apart?
Just stop scratching. You'll get them infected.
Something for Mosquito bites please?
Before or after?
What?
I'd get before and after.
 Look! Mrs. Birnbaum, my teacher is on TV!
That's our supermarket.
 Kids, we have to pack up and go find mommy.
Sir, you have to initiate the boarding process immediately.
Is this even possible? What's our information from China?
They estimate four of the ships will be ready for launch.
Only four?
If it's alright with you sir, I'll brief the panel about the new development.
I'd rather have Adrian do that. They trust him. I told him to be in on the meeting.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we all knew this day would come. But we never imagined it would come this soon.
I would like to pass this over to my science advisor, Adrian Helmsley.
I'll make this brief...
... According to our latest data from Yellowstone, the temperature of the subterranean crust of the earth, the cement that holds our landmass in place, is increasing at a rapid rate, much faster than anticipated...
... This causes extreme polar instability. The magnetic fields have decreased by more than 80% over the last 48 hours.
How much time do we have, Mr. Helmsley?
Two, maybe three days if we're lucky.
Apologies Prime minster. He's still new to the job.
Nevertheless, Mr. Antonioni, we have to make an immediate decision.
Introducing the 320 pound muscle machine from the Ukraine...
... and tonight's challenger for the heavy weight world championship of the world. Here he is... Mister Zultan Balashin!
Zultan!
 Ah, finally, Yuri. I thought I would not see you.
He needs to concentrate now, Mister Karpov.
You shut up... when I talk to my boy, understand?
Yes, Mr. Karpov.
Good... That is good. (in Russian to the BOXER) Zultan my friend. Do not forget. We are fighters. We never go down. We always stay on our feet...
... No matter who is hitting us. No matter how hard.
Now, go kill the bastard. 
Yuri bear... where are you going?
Lilly, we're home sweetie.  Wake up big man.
Oh honey, I'm so glad you're back... And you too, darling.
We tried calling but -
I'm hungry Mummy.
At least it looks like the Mosquitos ate well.
Wanna come in?
Where are you Curtis?
Back in Westwood, Mister Karpov.
Good. That is good. I'm sending the Gulfstream to pick up Alec and Oleg.
 Tell him to bring Caesar's raincoat, it's in the Range Rover.
Curtis, make sure you get my boys as fast you can.
Curtis, you are late.
Careful with our stuff. Don't get it dirty.
... There will be famines, pestilences and earthquakes, sayeth the Lord.
Curtis, can't you go faster?
Are you guys blind? I can't run people over.
Why not? They're idiots anyway.
Hey Jackson. Took you a while...
Ouch! Be more careful!
Now you're laughing, Curtis. But we are going on a big ship.  We will live... and you will die.
Where can I rent a plane?
 ... just this morning my people at Caltech told me that in the last 36 hours we had basically zero earthquake activity in Southern California, which is very rare... 
... Kate, we have to get out of LA! I've rented a plane for us. Get the kids ready! I'll be there in five.
The kids have plans today...
Are you kidding me!
No I'm not! Noah has music at 2 and Lil' has Karate.
Not that we'd expect him to remember.
 California is going down! Pack up the kids!
You're crazy! The Governor just said we're fine now.
The Governor's a meathead, how would he know anything? Kate listen! You gotta trust me over some politician. Come on.
Mommy, why are you so angry with Daddy?
Because your daddy is a lunatic, darling.
... it looks to me, like the worst is over.
We have to leave! Noah, let's go!
I think we're safer here!
Noah, now! Kate please...
I think he's right.
Get in the car!
Holy shit!
Damn it! Where's the pilot?
Gordon, you know how to fly.
I... had a couple lessons...
Did you cover taking off?
Yeah.
That's good enough for me.
Jackson, what are you doing?
I'm coming.
Come on, come on...
 But I'm supposed to check all these first...
Guys, behind us!
Gordon! Damn it! Lift off!
I can't get it up!
 That was amazing, Gordon!
Are you okay?
 I'm fine. How did you know this was gonna happen?
I didn't.  Do we have enough fuel to make it to Yellowstone?
You got fans Tony...
There's a call for you Harry. Want me to take a message?
 I'll be right there.
 Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Let's hear it for the one and only Tony Delgado... And I'm Harry Helmsley and we'll be back after a short pit stop.
Dad... what I have to tell you is very serious...
You remember when I told you about the dam in China? Well, it's happening much sooner than we anticipated.
The President has ordered us to clear out the White House.
Hah... About time someone cleaned up that mess.
Where are you, dad? What exactly is the course of the `Freedom' right now?...
It's all good, Adrian. Don't worry about your old man. You have more important things to do now.
You know, your mom and I, we had a hell of a great life... and a hell of a great kid too.  And the `Freedom' is a pretty big ship you know... Don't write your old man off, just yet.
... Besides, I could never leave Tony alone. You know how he can't keep decent time by himself.
I love you, dad.
Love you too, son.
Hey Herb. Get me a double Jack on the rocks.
After twenty-five years on the wagon?
Why not? Who cares how long we do certain things? How long we drink booze, how long we talk to people... Or how long we don't talk to people.
Woah!... Harry, what's the matter with you? Let's go. We're back on.
Call your kid, you stubborn old ass.  I'm not going back on that stage unless you promise to call him.
 Tony, the ladies are waiting for you.
Promise me, Tony... please.
Yeah, maybe I should call him...
... There is little we know at this point, but the earthquake registered at 10.1 on the Richter scale. The whole of the Western seaboard was hit...
 Have you seen this? 
We have satellite images. Here's the sequence we've got so far.
Any news from Yellowstone?
Anytime now.
Guys, there's fuel! Fill her up and I'll look for Charlie.
You're sure about this?
Kate, everything this guy said so far has happened. I'll be right back.
Daddy wait! I wanna come with you!
Lilly! Come back!
It's fine! I'll take her.
... I am standing here at the highest point on what is the rim of this super volcano...
He's got to be close by, Lil'bee...
Let's go back, Daddy.
Listen to me. We have to find Charlie. He's got a secret map, you know, like Jack Sparrow in `Pirates'.
Lil', we have to work as a team now, okay? You have to help me.
... The last time this baby blew, was 640,000 years ago...
Dial Mommy's number, sweetheart.
Hi mommy...
Where are you, honey!?
Tell her we'll be back in ten minutes.
 We're looking for a secret map, mommy.
Let me speak to your daddy, darling.
Daddy can't talk right now, he's driving really fast...
Ouch!
LILLY!
... I tell you guys, any minute now... any minute the fireworks will start...
Who's in the car with you? Who's that man screaming?
He's not in the car. He's on a mountain waiting for fireworks. 
 There he is! Up there!
You're the best, darling. Give Daddy the phone...  Kate I am sorry, I can't talk...
Bring back my child, Jackson! NOW!
You wait here for me! You watch the ship while Captain Curtis talks to the pirate. Okay?
 Okay...
 ... I wish you guys at home could see this on TV...
How did you make it up here? Thought you were toast.
The spaceships Charlie, where are they?
You can't make it there.
We have a plane. We can get you out of here too. Let's go Charlie!
You'll never make it out in time. Just stay and enjoy the big bang. That your kid?
Where is that god damn map!
Easy, easy. Watch the mic... I don't know. Somewhere in my camper.
Wow! Look at that!...  Fly birdies fly! This marks the last day of the United States of America folks and by tomorrow...
... the last of mankind. Soon they'll see us from a million miles away, out there in the milky way...
... The ash cloud will travel everywhere.  
First the lights will go out in Vegas, then Dallas, St. Louis and then Washington DC...
We're on our way.
Jackson, things are really looking bad here!
... it's beautiful, kids! Just beautiful!
 It's following us!
Just don't look back, Lil'bee!
Majestic!... Oh yeah!
Oh baby! It's coming!
`This is the end, my friend'...
... Folks, always remember, you heard it first from Charlie.
LILLY! DOWN!
Stay down there, Lil'! We're almost there! Just keep looking at daddy.
Mommy!
Stay down darling.
You guys go! I'll be right there!
Give me your hand, Lil'.
We have to take off!
No!
Where's daddy?!
Kate, I'm sorry but if we wait we'll all die!
Gordon! Wait!
JACKSON! NO!
It's daddy!
Jackson! Here!
Faster Dad. You can make it!
Kate, grab him for god sake. We're almost out of runway.
Thanks for waiting guys.
So, now that you got your map, where are we going?
We're gonna need a bigger plane.
Just a few minutes ago Yellowstone erupted, sir. The ash cloud will reach Washington in roughly 7 hours. Maybe 6. We have strong easterly winds...
And the crustal displacement?
No one knows, sir.
Let's get the government airborne and... I mean now.
Where is the President, Sally?
He said he wanted to spend a few minutes alone. I think he's over at the chapel.
The whole North American continent is about to perish, and Wilson decides to go to church!
He's praying sir. Which considering the circumstances is not a bad idea.
Maybe. But right now I need the leader of the free world off his knees and on Air Force One. Wheels up 1900 hours. Can I leave that with you Helmsley?
I really don't like that man.
Mr. President? We need to get you out of Washington immediately. 
Now matter how idealistic you are taking office. You lose your innocence behind that desk.  Laura was right. People have died because of the decisions I made.
That's not your fault sir.
You sound like Anheuser.
Laura's never looked at me like that before. Only once... When I told her, her mother had died. You knew the first lady?
A little.
You know what she said to me that night we brought her to the hospital?  `Tommy... I think you should do a lottery. Every one should have a chance to go'. That's what Dorothy said to me. That's what we should have done.
There would have been chaos, sir.
You know what I believe, Adrian. I believe nature should choose for itself, from itself.
Don't let her go. You'll regret it if you do. Prove to Laura what kind of a man you are. And I'll do the same... You go now. And watch your back for Anheuser. 
But sir?
Go. That's an order Helmsley.
Would you tell my daughter... there's nothing on earth that I cherish more than her.
I told you we should have gone to my parents' in the Rockies.
Gordon's right. Look at this mess.
You don't understand, it's our only chance.
This isn't one of your crazy stories now. How the hell are we gonna make it to China?
Gordon, without Jackson, we'd never have made it out of California.
Careful with the landing gear!  Tamara, get the boys out of the way!
 Attention! The US National Guard has informed us, that an extremely hazardous ash cloud is headed towards the city of Las Vegas.
We strongly advise every one to move indoors immediately...
Let's move people! Inside the terminal!
Where's Anheuser?
In the command center, sir.
The President is not coming. I couldn't convince him to.
So, the captain doesn't want to leave his sinking ship?  Well, Mr. Helmsley, we just learned that the Vice President's chopper crashed 80 miles north of Atlanta.
What about the Speaker of the House?
In this chaos... I have no idea!
But she's Commander In Chief now. Sir, I just think -
I don't care what you think, Helmsley.
Your ass only made it into the White House, because your old man knew the First Lady... and because of all that affirmative action bullshit.
There was a white kid, much more qualified than you. Just so you know.
Where is my father?
He wanted to stay with his people.
We have to go back!
Let me get out. Mr. Anheuser - tell the Captain.
There is a protocol for just this situation Ms. Wilson and I'm afraid we'll have to follow it to the letter.
Tell the Captain, to take off immediately.
People, stay away from the windows!
We can't get stuck here.
Dr. Silberman? What are you doing here?
 She's a patient, honey.
 Nice work.
You bastard. You knew it all along!  You and those spoiled rotten sons of yours...
I found us a plane, an Antonov. They were just about to take off, but the tower didn't let them.
Can you still fly that thing?
Sure... But I need a copilot.
Gordon is a pilot.
Let's go!
Hey! Stop! You can't go out there! Come back!
Wow, that is a big plane.
 It's Russian.
Guys, follow me!
 You'll find folding seats on each side of the cargo hold...
... Sit down and buckle up!
Wow! Look at those!
We had VIP tickets for that.
You check the main bus for the hydraulics. I'll balance the tanks.
Uh... What?
Work the radio and keep an eye on the fuel, okay?
Move back, people... down on the floor!
We have to get going! 
 We're going, we're going.
We're not gonna make it!
Shut up! We will!
GOVNO! . Help me pull!
Was that the Eiffel Tower?
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on our way to China.
But Lin is my brother. He is working inside the big tunnels, where the ships are made.
What is in your wisdom for us to do, great Lama... if Lin is right, if our world is indeed coming to an end?
It's full, great Lama. It can hold no more!
 Bata! Neng is coming!
Mother, I got a message from Lin. He wants us to meet him in Cho Ming, at the west gate. He says he can get us on one of the ships he is working on.
I thought Lin is working on the dam?
The dam is a ship, Mother. The government lied to us. There will be a big flood.
Not here in the mountains... Let's eat first.
No mother! We must pack up right away.
We took a trip with the Laem Song ferry once. Your father was throwing up the whole way.
Neng, I did not know you were coming for dinner.
Look, the new Bentley.
Our dad had one on order. We were supposed to get it next year.
But then he cancelled it again, because of the ships.
If I was rich, I'd get one of those.
We have one. How many cars does your family have?
My Mom's boyfriend has a Porsche, a Carrera 4.
Our parents are divorced too.
Nothing we can do about that.
Wow... look at this.
Be careful, Noh'!
How did you meet Dr. Silberman? He's great, isn't he?
I think for the same reasons you did. You know, after breast feeding two kids...
Did your husband ask you to get your's done?
We are not married. And we probably never will... But he paid for them.
I bet he did.
What did the man pay for mommy?
Nothing, Lil'bee.
What's your situation?
Way too complicated...
They seem to like each other.
I guess... So tell me Mr. Karpov - how much did you pay?
One billion euro, per seat.
That's disgusting.
You know Curtis, I wasn't always businessman. I am a boxer. Was my only playing when I was a boy, back in Murmansk. My coach...  ... his name also Yuri... He always said: `Someone wants to beat you... he has to kill you first'.
What would you have done, if you rich like me? Just look at your gorgeous kids. And call me Yuri...
Hi guys. The plan is to refuel in Hawaii. So, buckle up... Gordon and I will do the rest.
Let's get this straight, Sasha. I'm not a pilot. I'm a plastic surgeon. I just took some lessons to overcome my fear of flying.
Why did you give up?
It didn't work.
What about the wheels we lost at take- off?
There's 14 on each side. Some of them must still be there.
Still nothing from the tower?
Guys, you really oughta take a look at this.
What is that?
The State of Hawaii!
Not good. That is not good.
How much fuel do we have?
Not enough. We'll have to make a water landing somewhere in the South China Sea.
At least we won't need our landing gear.
What about it?
We lost it all... in Vegas.
Can I come in?
I've got nothing to say to you.
But I do...
Your Dad and I... we were trying to protect you.
 I'm a big girl Adrian. I don't need protection. You used me. You guys had me gallivanting around the world, as part of your little cover-up.
But you were doing a good job.
Sure, if your name's Da Vinci or Picasso. But if you're some young talent in Podunk, Texas, sorry you're not famous enough. People like you and Anheuser and my father - you think you can play God.
You know what your father believed. That nature will choose itself from itself.
That's bullshit and you know it. It's the fittest, the richest and the strongest that survive.
That's not true.
What would you say were the chances of a first time, middle-aged writer, who barely sold 500 copies of his novel making it on board this plane?
Zero. What's your point?
It's called `Farewell Atlantis' and it's a fantastic read. It's part of our legacy now.
Mr. Helmsley, Prof. West requests your presence immediately.
What if I tried to sort some of this mess out? I need to know you can forgive me...
I need to know that too, Adrian.
One more thing. Your father told me you were the most precious thing to him in the whole world... You are to me too.
She can't find her mother.
Why don't you two girls make yourself comfy on that big couch? I'll see what I can do.
Sally, can you take care of them. I'll go check with the Red Cross...
No wonder the First Lady fell for him. I knew Miss Dorothy Jones long before the President, when she was still singing jazz down in Atlanta with Harry Helmsley.
I know, she was amazing.
Who can help me with missing persons?
Don't worry about it. You're doing a great job son...
The capitol was hit by a 9.4.
We lost communication with the White House, sir.
President Makarenko for you sir. He's just entered Chinese air space.
That's affirmative, Mr. President. Until communication is restored, I am in command.
... It seems all other Heads of State are en route, however there are unconfirmed reports that the Italian Prime Minister has also decided to stay behind and trust in prayer rather than action...
 Hold on back there!
Couldn't sleep huh? Me neither.
Anything?
Nothing, just static. Not even an emergency signal.
I can't think about what's going on down there.
I wanted to thank you. For coming back for us.
I couldn't have left you...
Do you think people change?
By `people' are we talking about me?
Do you think you've changed since we separated?
Well I certainly eat a lot more cereal now...
You know, you always had tunnel vision. You could always just block things out and write. You blocked all of us out Jackson.
Do you love him? Gordon...
I love him enough.
... Cho Ming reports the first tremors, however none higher than 5.0.
By what degree? 
Any clue what to expect next, Professor?
Once the movement of our land masses comes to a halt, we expect the formation of tidal waves, sir... proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding quakes.
Do we have any news from the Japanese seaboard?
... Tokyo seems to have taken the severity of the hit... Unconfirmed reports indicate that the entire island of Japan is below water...
I called... But I never got through.
I'm so sorry.
Tony!!
I'm coming home Dorothy...
At least some good news.
Would our science advisor care to give us his assessment?
We expect enormous tsunamis to reach landfall in every continent. The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately six hours.
... and it looks like the crust has shifted by nearly 23 degrees in a south- westerly direction. Here's the computer simulation.
Our data also shows, that our earth's poles have reversed their magnetic fields...  ... These are their new positions.
So Helmsley, what you're telling us here is that... the north pole is now somewhere in Wisconsin?
It's the south pole, sir.
What's that?
Engine failure. GOVNO! Two of six are down. We must get ready.
Let's go wake up the kids.
Why do you hate Gordon?
What are you talking about? I don't hate Gordon.
But you don't like him either.
I don't know him that well.
But I know him. He's really nice. You should talk to him more often. You guys would get along really well.
I'll give it a try, Noah. I promise.
Is it time?
Wake up Lil'bee. We're getting ready to land.
What's wrong?
Sasha told us, it could get a little bumpy... and wet.
Your daddy has to tell you something.
I know that with my writing and work I didn't have a lot of time for you both...
I wasn't there for you, the way I should have been.
... And I am so very sorry for that.
Jackson, Yuri... I think you guys should come back up here.
Don't ask me how that happened.
There's no more ocean, and it looks like we're pretty close to where we wanted to go.
It's as if the whole earth shifted by 1500 miles...
No shit.  It's called 'Earth Crust Displacement' Gordon... Prof. Hapgood, 1958.
Way to go Charlie!
We lost our last two engines.
I'll shoot for that glacier. Drain the brake fluids. It's going to get rocky... There, the blue levers!
Listen up guys! This may sound a little crazy, but here's what you got to do...
 Get up! Follow me!
Yuri bear, what are we doing?
We're taking the Bentley!
CHTO ZA... Gordon! We're still too fast!
Now! Open it!
SHUT UP EVERY ONE!
Engine... start...
Voice control... Sold me on it.
Your turn Gordon! Go! Make sure that they make it out of here before I touch down!
What about you?!
I'll be fine! I have to land this thing!
What are you waiting for! 
Push it Curtis!
We're waiting for Sasha and Gordon.
Tamara! Open the door!
Where's Sasha?
He said he'll be fine and we should get out of here before he touches down.
Daaadddy!
Everybody okay back there?
We're all fine.
Welcome to the People's Republic of China.
Thank you...  Say thank you, kids.
What color are your passes?
What color are your boarding passes?
I have green card.
For my boys and me.
It's a joke... a mistake...  Right Yuri?
 You disgust me. You pig.
You think I did not know about you and Sasha? May god rest that poor bastard's soul.
I am sorry guys. Good luck. And Jackson remember, if someone wants to beat you... he has to kill you first. Come boys!
What!... Did that just happen!?
EMPTY_LINE
 Mr. Anheuser - you're in Chopper 1. Dr. Wilson the same.
I'm Captain Richard Michaels. I'm the skipper of the American boat sir. After you!
My sincerest condolences Dr. Wilson, for your father...
Your party is the last to arrive.
I've been told of damages?
We haven't completed the assessment but it looks like we lost Number 4 when the crust shifted.
There it is!
What do mean we can't board Number 4? I want to speak to your supervisor.
I am the supervisor! Now get in line with all the others while we make arrangements.
I want your name!
 Can you read? Now get the hell back with the other green cards, or I'll have you detained.
Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart. You're doing great.
I should have listened to you, Dr. Silberman. I actually liked the way I looked before that monster talked me into it.
Did you know he asked for a discount... and he paid in installments?
Cheap bastard.
You're better off without him. What he said about you and Sasha, is it true?
Now that he's gone I think he was worth a hundred times a man like Yuri.
You guys hear that?
 Hey! Help! Wait for us!
Shit! Shit!
Captain Michaels? What happens to all those people?
Dr. Wilson, there's a protocol for all that. You just stick to your art. We'll handle the rest.
Captain? Where is the Bridge?
Dr. Wilson? Your cabin is this way.
Satnam?  Where are you?
On the Nampan Plateau...
What?!
There's a tidal wave coming from the East! It's huge!
Satnam, what happened?
We never got picked up, Adrian, the airlift never came!
I have to go!
Do we have the latest satellite images of Napam, India?
One moment, sir.
Helmsley, what's going on here?
Looks like our model was wrong.
Satnam was talking about a wave from the East.
Jesus!
What does this mean?
The flooding will happen earlier. Bobby, can you plug in the new data please?
Satnam didn't get picked up.
Ready sir.
This one is at least 1500    meters high!
Talk to me Helmsley. What does this mean for us?
Bobby, plug in the new data and adjust the count down?
Get me the other Heads of State.
 Who are they?
We found them by the side of the road, my brother.
You must send them back.
I am a follower of the great Lama Yak La. You know I cannot do that.
Come with daddy.
At least take our children with you. Please.
Why should I do that?
For the same reason you sent for your parents.
I have no clue if you understand what I'm saying, but I ask you as a mother, please take my kids with you!
 We are all children of this earth.
My plan will not work for so many, mother. 
We will take them all. Bata?
Thank you ma'am. Thank you so much.
They're leaving without us!
What did I tell you!
 Look! Idiot! They are leaving you behind too!
 We have to hurry!  They launch! We run out of time!
Countdown to departure. Launch in 17 minutes - 42 seconds.
Where can I find Adrian Helmsley?
He's in the Technical Command Centre. Follow me.
 Faster, Neng! Help father! Mother, give me your hand.
Move Lil'bee!
 Oh my god, that's Yuri!
Caesar!
Let that stupid dog go!
 Okay. Now!
Tamara! Come on! Get in!
 Down there! Oleg, you go first!
Daddy look, Tamara!
Caesar darling!
Tamara! Get in!
Come to mommy!
I need your help.
What in god's name is happening Adrian?
Anheuser convinced them all to launch.
Anheuser! We have to stop this madness.
Bobby, make sure the other bridges can hear this.
What do you think you're doing?
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Turn it on!
This is Adrian Helmsley, science advisor to President Wilson...
Can you please turn up the volume, Mr. Hoffmann?
I know we've all been involved in making difficult decisions... to save our human civilization...
... But to be human means to care for each other, and civilization means to work together to create a better life. If that's true there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what we're doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we really stand by and let all those people out there die?
A civilization that allows that, does not deserve to survive.  Or at least I don't want to be part of it.
We'll miss you Helmsley but somehow we'll get by. Officer switch that off.
That's an order soldier.
Don't do it!
We have to open our gates and let these people in. All of them.
Have you lost your mind? Look at the countdown. We have less than five minutes left... And none of our ships have the resources to feed those people. If you save them today we all starve tomorrow.
Do you wanna be responsible for the extinction of the human race? Can you handle that, Adrian?!
There is a young astrophysicist from India who is the reason we are all here, trying to give mankind a second chance. He's the one who discovered it all, the one who connected the dots. We all owe him our lives.
I just learned that he was killed with his family by a tsunami in eastern India. You know why?
He died because we forgot to pick him up.  I beg you... whatever our future holds don't let us start it with an act of cruelty. What will you tell your children... and their children?
If my father were here, he would open the gates.
The people of Russia along with...
... China and Japan agree to open the gates.
The United Kingdom, Spain, France and Germany, and I believe I can also speak for the Italian Prime Minister...
... We vote to open the gates.
Captain Michaels, you heard them.
Phew... It stinks in here.
Sssh...Caesar.
They're opening the gate! It will crush us!
Noah! Watch out!
No!
Something happened, mom.
We have to stop it!
You did it, man. You did it.
What's wrong with the gate?
I don't know. Maybe there's something jamming it, sir.
Sir, we have a breach in the zoological bay.
Can you zoom in?
I know those kids. Remember the book I told you about? Their father wrote it.
We're loaded. We can close the gates sir.
Do it!
 Pull yourself up!
To the lower decks people!
Oleg! Catch your brother!
Boys, you gotta move.
We wait for our father! He's still down there!
There's no one down there.  Come on boys, come...
Why is the stern gate not closing?
Something's wrong with the hydraulics, sir.
Captain, over here.
I think we found the problem.
How did they get in there?
They must have come through the hydraulic chamber. There...
That guy is injured. Something must have gone wrong.
You're damn right something went wrong! Congratulations Helmsley, you may have just killed us all but as long as your conscience is clean...
Let's get an emergency crew there right now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic Chamber.
You think you're the main man now, just because your fucking the President's daughter?
What are you all waiting for?
If we can't close the stern gate, then the engines won't start.
There's no way to override it?
No sir, it has to be done manually.
 Almost there, Lin...
Water has penetrated the stern!
What now?
The rear of the ship will start sealing itself up one compartment at a time.
Then how will we get to the hydraulic chamber?
If we don't hurry, we won't be able to.
Tamara! Take Lilly and Noah.
I was so worried about you.
Mummy!
Lilly run!
Lilly! Take him.
Is there any way to talk to them?
We have to move him higher.  Over there!
Moving at 34 knots, sir.
What is our position?
Darjeeling valley, heading south east, sir.
You must be kidding!
We need something to stop the bleeding or he'll die.
Mum, will this do?
 Mr. Curtis... I'm Adrian Helmsley. We met once before. Your daughter is with me.
Lilly!
I'm alright Mom!
We can't get to you. Whatever you did, jammed the hydraulics. If you can't get it out... None of us will make it.
You're our only hope.
I'll go back. I'll try my best.
I'll go with you.
You stay with Mommy.
I'll be right back...
Captain, what's happening?
What's happening?...  We're heading straight for the north face of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser.
Noah!
Mom, we did it!
We got it free. Can you hear me? We did it!
Captain Michaels - close the gate!
That's affirmative. Close the gate!
Ay, ay, Sir.
Engage starboard stabilizers!
One is engaged... two is engaged... number three is out, sir!
Noah! Where is he?
He was just behind me...
If you would ever consider to give me another chance... I promise, I'll always be there when you need me.
Whatever you do... I will never let you go again.
... Day 988. No one is waiting for anything to happen...
...   and all we can hear is the sound of our   own breathing that reminds us we are   still sharing our memories, hopes and   ideas.
... And funny, just today we found out that the entire crew of the Atlantis, somehow or another, has relatives in Wisconsin.  The end.
How many copies did you say that sold?
Less than 500.  It's what you might call a cult classic.
It seems we have very different tastes Mr. Helmsley?
 Well that's healthy Dr. Wilson. Something we could maybe explore... unless you have other pressing engagements.
Actually my diary's pretty open.
 Mr. Helmsley to the bridge please.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Michaels speaking. In a few minutes, I will be giving the orders to unseal the decks.
Please be careful when you step out and of course... enjoy the fresh air.
Daddy? When can we go back home?
There's nothing we can go back to Lil'bee. Whatever's out there, that's our home now. Don't be scared.
I'm not Daddy. No more pull-ups.
 That's my big girl.
Can we pet him?
Of course you can. He's your doggie.
You called for me, sir?
Prof. West has something to show you, Mr. Helmsley.
Looks like your scientific projections are way off again.
The water is receding much faster than we projected, Adrian...
What's that?
It's hard to believe, but the Himalayas are no longer the roof of the world. It's now the Drakensberg mountains of Kwa-Zulu Natal. The whole African continent has risen several thousand feet and most likely, never even flooded.
Our European colleagues have already set course for it.
Here, somebody wants to talk to you.
This is Helmsley.
No, this is Helmsley.
Dad!... Is that you?
We should have a visual of the `Freedom of the Seas' shortly.
Dad. We're coming to pick you guys up. How's Tony?
He's fine, son. We're all fine. 
See you guys soon. Bye dad.
Put that woman down Helmsley.
Young guys like you with your idealistic dreams, you think you can change the world...
I just pray to God, that you keep on making the right calls... in this new world of ours.
Mr. Helmsley, one more thing.
There was no one.
Pardon me?
There was no white kid better than you. I'm terribly sorry I said that.
This is your Captain speaking. Standby to open Deck 1.
Standing by Sir. 
 I wonder will the clouds look the same and the stars?
Do not fear. Some things will never change.
I thought you might want this.
Do you think I'll still get a signal ... Dad?
I finally finished your book Jackson.
Really? You may well be the first person who ever got to the end.
Excuse me, I believe he's addressing the author. Well, what did you think?
I'd say... those astronauts of yours would be shitting themselves, if they knew all their relatives are now stuck in the South Pole.
