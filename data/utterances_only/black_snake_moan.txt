Still need a lift?
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
Gonna have a smoke.
Shit...
Baby...
You sick?
This ain't gonna work.
Rae...
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
 Rae don't do this now...
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Rae!
 Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
You gonna miss your bus.
This watch here is gonna beep at midnight. Every night. That's when it comes up on you the hardest, right?
And wherever I'm at, my watch'll beep, too. We'll be thinkin' bout each other at the same time. Wherever we are.
I gotta believe we can do this or I ain't gonna make it, Rae.
Okay... Okay.
I love you.
Shit.
Goddammit, Ronnie... (shouting in frustration) GODDAMMIT!
 Mm-mm  Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
MM-MM! MM-MM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
We're done, right?
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
I didn't start this, R.L.
You wanna pray with me 'fore you go in? Laz? (R.L. touches Laz's arm and bows his head) Heavenly Father...
We do not question your divine plan for us, Oh God. But in these times, when our spirit lies in shadow. When we are lost.
We ask that you give us strength. Give us strength that surpasses all understanding. In your name we pray. Amen.
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
Can I start you both off with some coffee 'fore I take your order?
We won't be stayin' long. Coffee'll be fine.
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
 If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
And you gonna live it with him?
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
I keep the heat on.
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
Kept us warm for twelve years.
I deserve better than this.
Better'n me?
Better than what you give.
Rose... please...
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
 I don't love ya no more.
I'm sorry you hurtin'. But, like I say, this the only life I got. (waits for him to respond) I said my piece.
God forgive you, for how you done me...
Let go...
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
Let go of my arm...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
LAZ, I said let...!
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
 Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
 Yeah, go'on! Look! See if I give a shit about any of you people!
You got any money?
Thought you had a man for that.
 I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'.
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
 Alright. How much you need, ho?
The hell you call me?
Eh, if the bootie fits...
You gonna get rough? Is that what you doin'?
 I swear, I seen some buck-wild bitches in my time, but you the illest I ever seen.
Just got a cough.
It's already noon, Rae. You think that skirt should still be on?
 If it weren't you could kiss my rebel cootch, ya faggot.
Cough drops or condoms?
 Didn't know you was workin' here now?
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
 You let me know if I can be of any assistance.
You won't at the square this mornin'.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Yes'sir.
Keep the change on that.
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
Alright, Lincoln. You come on by, I'll load you up.
You gonna put some Luther Vandross in here? Shit, he black ain't he?
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
They're from New York. My niece gets 'em on the computer.
They got blue snakes up north?
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Don't gotta tell me. Me and my girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them hard fingertips he got pickin' that guitar.
Got'em pickin' peas, not strings.
They still hard?
Mayella. It ain't happened yet. Ain't happenin' tonight.
 I know you hurtin', Laz. I got ears, you know. But you should know more'n me... ain't no better cure for them blues than some good pussy.
Whole lotta woman, right there.
She can still spread it around.
Laz. We friends and all but... promise me you'll keep yo cool in my joint.
I'm gonna finish my beer.
Mind if I sit?  Rose said... it didn't go too well this afternoon. See, that's not how we wanted this to go down. I told her, I said, Rose, we ain't leavin' till we make peace with Laz. And that's God's truth. I laid it down.
You laid it down.
I did.
Funny. Layin' it down... for my wife.
We're not gonna get through this clean. But it don't need to get dirty. All this... it just come together unexpected. You think I want to hurt you? I... I'd take a bullet for you, Laz.
You wanna give that a try?  Bo. You still got that .22 behind the tap? My little brother say he'd take a bullet for me.  You come here to ease your heart. Well, I ain't gonna give it to you. You took her into your bed, now you gotta lie in it.
I'll always love you, Laz. Till the end of my...
LAZ!
Cain slew Able. Slew him out of envy. And God put his mark on Cain for his sin. You want that mark, Deke? Give you that peace you come here for? I'll give it to you, just say that shit again. Say you love me. Go'on! Say YOU LOVE ME, NIGGA!
I'm through wit'cha both.
What'chu gonna do? Nothin'. YOU AIN'T GONNA DO NOTHIN'!
 Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
He'd be good for that. Shit, Ronnie knows cars.
He get stubborn. Starts talkin' 'bout obligation and duty and all that... Shit. I just want him to come home... I swear, if somethin' happens to him...
He fixed up that Buick for my uncle Dale. He say it purrs like a kitten every morning.
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
 I begged him not to go. And he did.
 PUNT YOU FUCKERS!
These baby chicks just can't hold their Jello shots. I'm tellin' ya.
Tennessee Vols gotta practice indoors just so those Florida State sons-a- bitches don't spy on their plays with satellites and shit.
Satellites... You mean in space?
Uh-huh.
Good thing you can block, Conner, cuz you're dumb as a sack of shit.
You wanna go home?
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
 Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
One more. Fuck the chaser.
Better?
Yeah.
Hey, Jess.
Boys.
You robotrippin' tonight?
I'm just gonna smoke.
 Got eight packs of DXM. Oxycontin. Got a shit load of Coricidin if you want to get out-a-body, n'all.
You just trying to get me outta my clothes.
Be right back.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
You go to hell.
 How many to fuck me up?
What's so funny?
 Oh... I'm just on a water bed... And it's just... so... Goddamn... funny!
Hi.
Hey.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
No, ma'am.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Can I put it in your mouth?
Okay.
Seem like you and me... we drove her away. That's what we did. Now we...  Drinkin' muddy water... a'sleep in a hollow log...
You gonna do this?
 Just like a bird without a feather, you know I'm lost without your love. Just like a bird without a feather, you know I'm lost without your love. You know I need your love just like the angels need heaven above.
 Well I sure did shot my baby, but I did it because she did me wrong. Well I sure did shot my baby, but I did it because she did me wrong. You know the judge called it murder now the penitentiary is my home.
 I loved that woman, she said she didn't love no one but me. I loved that woman, she said she didn't love no one but me.
 Yeah but I caught my baby cheating.
 Now my home ain't where it used to be.
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
Stop what?
 The ground is... turnin' upside down. I'm gonna...  I'm gonna fall off...
Oh. That feels so much better.
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
I got others.
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
 I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
The fuck you laughin' at?
 You don't got half what Tehronne got.
 Get up! I ain't playin'! OPEN YOUR GODDAMN EYES!
Oh, Jesus...
Hey.
Huh?
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Don't know if God wanna see me.
He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
Mmmmmmmmmm... Mm!
Sweet... Jesus...
Little lady? Miss? You need to open your eyes for me. Could ya do that?
There we go. There we go. Just like you doin'. Go'on.
 Teh... Tehronne?
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
 You've reached the Fisherville Police Department. Your call will be answered in the order it was received. If this is an emergency, please, hang up and dial 9-1-...
 I'm'a go into town. Get you some medicine to fix you up. You just rest, okay, gal? You just sleep. Get that chill out'cha.
God... damn...
How's the squash this year?
It's good, Mister Melvin. I'll bring ya some.
Lazarus?
 Oh! Gave me a start.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
You hurt it?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
 Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
Well. It's good to see you.
Angela?
Yes?
I need to uh...
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
You take her to a doctor?
 No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
You wait right here.
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
NOOOOO!
Is your niece older than 12?
Oh, she older than that.
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
This gonna get you in trouble?
Not if no one finds out.
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
 Don't make it less true.
Hey, Lazarus. We closed up on Sunday.
Need a word with Tehronne.
 Yo, T! Laz wanna holla at cha.
Come on back, Cuz.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
Word wit'cha. In private.
You need some weed?
Been years since I fooled with that. (tries to find the words) You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
 That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
Huh?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
This Rae... you get with her?
Shit. Who hasn't?
Why you say that?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Now, hold up.
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
What'chu sayin'?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
What'chu sayin'?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Gal? Miss Rae? Rae, you hear me?
Hold on, now. Hold on!
Now, I ain't gonna hurt'cha. Calm down, Miss.  Listen... Listen... LISTEN NOW, GAL! (Rae settles in his grip) I ain't gonna hurt ya, hear? Gotta get you well. Now, look me... HEY! Look me in the eye.
Open your eyes. Go'on, now. You need to see, ain't no harm here. Ain't no harm.  My name is Lazarus Woods. And I ain't gonna let you die.
...you don't... touch me... s'no... NO! Mm-mm... Mm-MMMMMMMMMMMMM! N- N'you FUCK!
Mm-mm... mm-mm... Ma-muh... Ma-MUH!  See... S... See if'I GIVE... GIVE'A... SHIT...
 'BOUT ANY OF YOU PEOPLE!
I know, child, I know. Gotta break that fever now.  Don't mean to hurt'chu. But I ain't lettin' you die.  I AIN'T LETTIN' YOU DIE!
Put fear of the Devil in me, gal. Got me spooked like I's a kid, I tell you. (flips through the pages) But the good Lord, He showed me what to do. He come knockin' like my man R.L. say... listen here...  This here Matthew. He talkin' on how Jesus was healin' the sick. And a man come up to the disciples and he say...  Have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic, and sore vexed...  He got the devil in his mind and sores on his skin.  And he brought the boy to the disciples, but they could NOT cure him.
 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation... how long shall I suffer you? Bring the boy hither to me. And Jesus rebuked the devil.  You hear that?  Then the disciples say... Why could not we cast the devil out? And Jesus said unto them...
Listen now... This what he sayin' to us. He say...  If ye have faith... if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto a mountain, remove hence... and it... shall... move. And nothin'... nothin' shall be impossible to you.  You hear that? You just need a bit of faith. You just gotta believe you gonna get well, like I do.
That's better. You coolin' down. Okay. You rest. Okay. You rest.
 Ronnie...
Ronnie... RONNIE!
Gal? Gal?
 Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
You travelin' right now, gal. You asleep and you don't even know it.  Now... come on inside with me.
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Come on, gal...
NO! NOOO! NOOOOOOOOOO!
 Is'okay... Is'okay...
 Goin' over that hill. Goin' over that hill. Well, I ain't gonna stop until I reach my God's top. I'm goin' over the hill. Well I went to the valley, I didn't go to stay. Soul got happy, I stayed all day. I'm goin' over that hill.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
What'chu sayin'?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
Uh-huh.
He tapped that.
Naw!
Go ask him.
She been bumpin' around all her life, hookin' up with whoever keep her fed and fucked.
I seen her give it up on park benches, back of trucks, hoopty hoods, you name it.
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
Nuh-uh.
Meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat.  She into football, you know. You got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap. I ain't playin'.
How a girl get like that?
Like I told you.
Girl got a sickness.
What'chu gonna do? Huh? Nothin'. YOU AIN'T GONNA DO NOTHIN'! NOTHIN'!
 Tell me who's that writin'? John the Revelator. Wrote the book of the seven seals.
Hey.
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
 How long... how long I been out?
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
 Two days?
After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
Found you on the side of the road. Someone took to beatin' on you pretty bad. You know who done that to you?
Where's Ronnie?
Well I don't...
 Wait. He left.
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Don't need none.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Let me say somethin' first...
Why you got me chained?
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
The fuck you been doin' to me?
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
 Get this Goddamn thing off me!
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
Gal, you ain't right yet.
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
How you let men treat ya like they do?
What?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
 Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
 The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
 I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
What do you want?
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
You some kind'a pervert?
No ma'am.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
In my house, you watch that lip...
 Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
 HELP!
SOMEBODY!
SOMEBODY HELP ME!
 Ain't gonna be moved.
GAL! I ain't gonna be moved on this!
LET ME GO!
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
Or what?
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
Whose doin' is that?
Okay... OKAY! I'M COMIN' IN! NOW QUIT IT!
Say we talk. Just take a seat on the sofa. I'll get us somethin' cool to drink.
You may not remember. But you spent a whole half day in my tub, tryin' to cool down. Melted four ice trays.
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
Think I'm gonna let you do me like that...
 Okay, now... I ain't gonna hit'cha. (the burning is starting) Just lost my cool there. (he throws the belt away) Now take that look out'cha eye.
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
 Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I said... STOP!
 I CAN'T!
Hmmmmmm... Stop-it!... STOP-IT!
You hungry?
I put some back ache into growin' them greens. You should slow down and see how they taste.
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
 If I break one you gonna shoot me?
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Uh-uh.
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
Itches.
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
Uh-uh.
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story... (quelling his frustration) Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
 My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you! (grips her by the legs) I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
Let go of me...
GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
GET OFF ME!
 Didn't mean to go off on a tear like I did. I just got to thinkin' about things...
Why is it you old men gotta talk so much? Like little boys, gotta talk yourself into fuckin' me. (his knuckles touch her skin) We can take our time. I'm grown. I get it.  You wanna give me 'nother bath?
 Goddammit.
There goes our fortune. We been doin' good for ourselves since you been away.
Y'all know when Ella Mae's open up?
You needin' to buy some pantyhose?
Just some dresses.
Hello? Hey!
I don't believe this shit.
Enough to choke a Goddamn horse.
I'm needin' some women's clothes. A few dresses. Maybe some shoes. But they gotta be nice. They gotta be proper. Clothes a woman would want, where she could feel and look like a woman without... you know, lookin' like a tramp or a hussy or somethin'.
And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
 That young lady's size, right'cher.
Well, that makes it easier.
Well... I hope these will work for your niece. She can always come back in and swap sizes.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
For your hands?
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
 I'll take a jar of that, too.
Lookin' for Miss Angela.
She in the back.
Wait right there.
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
 You didn't have to do this.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
Look here. I got somethin' special for you.
This here is a whipped... body cream. And it's got a smell to it. Tell me what you think.
They call this Ginger Souffle. Best if it... if it go on your skin just after you been in a hot tub... or shower.
This was very sweet of you.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
Oooooo.
Hush up.
You gonna be on the square later on?
Got all my honey-do's done with. I'm headin' home.
Stay cool. It's a hot one.
Hey, Red. Was that Laz just left?
Yes'sir, Rev'rend.
 You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are gray. You'll never know dear how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away. A voice from outside spins her around. The guitar barks as Rae slams it down on the table.
Mister Lazarus?
Mister Laz... I come for the butter beans.
Ain't seen you on the square. Mister Laz, can you hear me?
 Mister Lazarus?
Mister Laz, I'm comin' inside...
SHIT BOY! WHAT THE HELL YOU...!
CAN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR ONE...
Lincoln, come on back.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Why's his britches round his knees?
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
You get a call from Rose?
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
Goin' dove huntin'?
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
 Ain't gonna be moved?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
 Or what?
I told you to TURN BACK!
YOU GO'ON AND SHOOT ME, KILLA!
Ought'a stomp yo ass pointing this at me.  Always gotta bring up the preachin'. Like you just a sheep in my flock and all I'm good for is poundin' on a pulpit.  Dammit, Laz... we may not be blood. But we sucked off the same old nurse since the day we was slapped on the ass. And you gonna point a gun at me?
If you in some trouble, than WE gonna figure somethin' out. You and me.  Wipe your face!
Now... this got anything to do with Rose?  Then what?
 I didn't want to.
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
What's that chain around her for?
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
Go in and talk to her. Please.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
One thing at a time, Laz.
Watch y'self in there. That girl'll jump on ya junk like a grasshopper.
Did I hurt'chu?
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
Why she got a chain on her?
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
 Please don't tell my daddy.
My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
So...  That your first time?
Yes'sir.
You struck some gold, didn't ya?
Shit. My first time was with my second cousin behind my uncle's barn. She weighed two tons, if a pound. Could'a done a lot better for myself. You sho'nuf did.
Thank you.
 I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
 You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is... (R.L. yanks on the chain) You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
You a preacher?
That's right.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
You could put it that way.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
What's on your mind?
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
There's sin in my heart. There's evil in this world. But when I got no one... I talk to God. I ask for strength. I ask for forgiveness. Not for peace at the end of my days when there's no more life to live and no more good to do, but today. Right now.
What's your heaven? What gives you peace?
 Ronnie.
 This is Ronnie again. Don't know if you been gettin' my messages but... I'm down at the bus station and...  I just need you come get me. You get this message, I'm on the interstate headin' downtown toward the square.  Rae. I really need you to... come find me. Please.
We gonna eat with her?
That's what I was told.
She still gonna have that chain on?
Well... I'm working on that. (trying to change the subject) So... what's goin' on in your life, Lincoln?
I ain't no virgin no more?
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Uh-uh.
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
I don't fuckin' cook.
 Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
I can handle that.
 Well, get to it.
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
This all looks wonderful.
I skipped lunch.
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
 Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
 Ask the chef.
Cayenne pepper.
 Holy shit.
 Yeah.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
Sure.
 Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.
Hey, Herman.
They buy you that big chicken dinner?
What?
They got little names for everything in the corps when they trying to get rid of ya. Don't know what it's like in the guard. There's what you call a bad conduct discharge, a BCD... we all called it the big chicken dinner. It ain't the brig but it'll fuck ya for life if you wantin' to work for the government.
That's not what this is about.
They got another little name called ad-sep. That sound about right?
Ad-sep. Administrative separation.
 How do you get one of those?
Blowin' boys in the head, for one.
Whoa, son! I ain't sayin' shit about you. I'm just talkin'.
Well, you don't know what you're talking about so why don't you shut the fuck up?
Hey, it's alright, man. It's alright.  Herman. Come on. He just got back.
To get back ya had to've gone somewhere.
What happened?
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
I guess it could be worse. You could be comin' back in a body bag.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
She's around. Always is.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
You been home yet?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
You need a ride?
Rae?
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared...  ...and run.
Drink. Come on, drink some.
Her momma works down at the grocery, down on the square. Maybe she seen her.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
That's not right, really, cuz I...
 You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. Army'd pay for school. You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself.
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
Now wait...
 With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me. (Gill releases Ronnie and walks away) And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her. (Ronnie can't believe it) Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
 Don't you think it's funny how I know where everything in your house is?  I don't care if that hurts you or not. Truth is I don't know who you are anymore. So fuck it.
You gonna steal my truck?
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Not like that.
Then what?
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
I can't leave unless I get your word.
Laz. I got some news you need to hear. It's about Rose and your brother. (this is not easy for R.L.) She's pregnant. She gonna have a baby.  Her sister told my wife. You know how them sewing circles go. Just a matter of time till you got word. Thought that's why you been keepin' to yourself out here. (Laz conceals his pain) I don't know how much of this is to make her happy or to hurt you. But it is what it is.
I'm through with them both.
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
You drink whiskey?
You take it straight?
Sure.
 To my baby brother. Gonna be a daddy.
Well, that's good news. So you're gonna be someone's uncle.
Want another?
We drinkin' buddies now?
 To freedom.
Still makin' jokes?
 No joke.
Not my place to change your mind, or anybody else's. People gonna do how they please. You only get one life... should be lived the way you wanna live it.
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
I ain't in a hurry.
Could you do somethin' for me?
Anything.
 Ain't played 'fore nobody in years.
 Funny how a sound just speak to ya heart.
 Wanted me some kids. A whole mess of 'em. But Rose, my wife... chil'ren was for another time.  They's this one spring... I saw a change in her. Her breasts start swellin' up. Come a few mornings I hear her heavin' in the bathroom. I seen it with women before. I knew.
Come a day, Rose say she had to go visit her folks in Jackson. Didn't want me to come... so I stayed put.  When she come back...  They talk about a woman havin' that glow. Couldn't see it no more. She... took it away. Cut it out.
One night... While she sleepin'. Held a pillow in my hands. I could see myself killin' her. What evil in my heart make me wanna kill her, I don't know? It's that voice in me. Each time I think it's gone, he come howlin' back. Devil or no, I don't know. But I am a haunted man.
Calls me when I'm ailing. When I can't find my home, lost in the pines. I calls it the Black Snake Moan. (he closes his eyes and sings) Mm-mm... Got no momma now.Mm-mm... Got no momma now.It's over late last night, don't need no momma now.
Sing, Lazarus. (kneels next to him in fear) Please keep singin'.
 Mm-mm... Black snake crawlin' in my room.Mm-mm... Black snake crawlin' in my room.Some pretty momma better come and get this black snake soon.
 Black snake is evil, black snake is all I see.Black snake is evil, black snake is all I see.Woke up this mornin', black snake moved in on me.
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
I'm here with you.
I had love in my heart. And I gave it to one woman. And she gone now.  Where am I gonna put all this love?
You can give it to me.
You can't start this and not finish. Not with me.  Please...
Wait... I gotta stop... (Rae's kisses get more aggressive) Rae stop... (she can't hear, the burning has her) Dammit, Rae... GET OFF!
This ain't the way for me. I'm sorry.
Not gonna lie to you, Laz...  This one's a doozy. I don't think... I don't think I can stop this.
Tell me what to do.
 The... chain helps.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
 Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
You think God forgives people like that?  You think God forgives people like me?
Hold me. Oh God...
We'll just stay here. Wait till it passes.
Where you gonna be?
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
This town ain't goin' nowhere. You take the time you need.
Friend of mine.
I bet you have loyal customers.
 You liked what I brung ya?
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
That'd be nice.
I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
 That's nice, too.
Hey.
What happened to your face?
Got in a little accident.
 Yeah.
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
You need money again?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
I just wanted some make-up.
All that shit's on aisle 5.
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
The hell are you talkin' about?
Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.  I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
...tell me you don't know... goddamn LIAR!
SAY IT! JUST FUCKING SAY IT!
Rae! Rae! What are you doin'?
 GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME! GET... HIM...OFF!
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
At church?
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
 You gonna sing me somethin'?
When? Now? Oh. No.
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
 There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole.
 There is a balm in Gilead to save my sick, sick soul.  So. You think I should be in the choir?
What? What is it?
RAE? GAL? YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
I'll take you home now.
This your cousin?
Move, son. (Ronnie is unable to move) Goddammit, kid, get outta my way!
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
I tried.
You and me, we night owls. No use fightin' this shit.  Get up.
What is it?
Nothin'.
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
By myself?
You can handle it.
The hell is this shit?
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
Shit hole... Hey kiss my ass, Laz.
Nigga, you go'on kiss my ass. Ya both called everybody, didn't ya?
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
Heard about this morning.
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
You in for it, now. He gonna nail it to the wall tonight. I done pissed him off.
 I don't know, but I been around, tell me them women shake 'em on down.
 Yes, I'm goin' Georgia line. See if them women sweet like mine.
You wanna cut it up, baby?
 Well...
 Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
 I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.
Yeah, gal I been here before.
 I guess you have.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
Don't think that'd be wise.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Baby, where you goin'?
I'm gonna pee. I gotta take a break and go pee.
Now, this isn't fair. You said I could do it, too.
Eat shit and die, Arty. A girl can change her fuckin' mind.
Hey.
Hey.
You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
 I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
You feelin' sick?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Yeah, I know.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Yeah?
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
Are you wasted?
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
 Holy shit!
What?
Holy shit, Ronnie! (smacks him on the arm) You're a fuckin' rock star.
I'm a what?
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
Hey? You okay, Ronnie?
 I'm not like this. I'm not usually so... afraid.  I don't know what's... wrong...
Is'okay... Is'okay...
I feel better. Do you?
Yeah, I do.
 You... are my... sunshine.
Sorry.
Looks like you know a song.
Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
 How you feelin' today?
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
I know that.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
What I love.
Get a good picture in your mind.
Think on that. And sing wit me.  You are my sunshine. My only sunshine.
Good. I know another. It go like this.  Last night dear, as I lay sleeping. I dreamed I held you in my arms. When I awoke dear, I was mistaken. So I hung my head and I cried.  Close your eyes Rae... sing it.
 You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are gray.
 You'll never know dear, how much I love you. Please don't take your sunshine away.  RONNIE!
RONNIE STOP! RONNIE!
NO!
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
Ronnie. Please, baby...
 Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
Ronnie...
YOU SHUT UP!
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
 Or what? OR WHAT?
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You sayin' you'll do what?
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
 BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
Ain't that easy, is it? I been in some scraps, son, I know. First there's that loud crack. Always louder than you think. Like it just come-up- a-cloud and clapped a mess thunder right in ya hand. BAM!
White light. Smell of smoke. Taste of my blood and brains in your mouth, stingin' ya eyes.
Oh, baby... just let me...
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason. (watches Ronnie fight his attack) You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
Don't... don't say that to me...
 Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house... (looks at Rae and then back at Ronnie) ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Go'on. Do it.  DO IT!
Ronnie?
I can't stop... I can't stop... being scared. What am I gonna do...
I got you, baby... I got you...
 DAMMIT LAZ PUT THE PHONE DOWN?
Thought you knew me better, gal.  I need you at my house... right now.
 I imagine there's a lot of good between you two. But I want you to tell me what's bad. Go'on. And don't hold back.
I hate this town. You can't round the corner without bumping into someone who's got your number.  We did a lot of dreamin', me and Rae. Makin' plans to get out. I'd do my tour and... we'd move outta here. Go to Chattanooga. And I'd work for my uncle. (looks down, tears come to Ronnie) But... when Rae gets like she does. And she does the things that she always done. Makes me feel like she loves this place more'n me.
Go on, Ronnie.
All my life people called me shit like, sissy and... nervous and... I got few things in my life that make me feel like... like...
Like a man.
 Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
 Now, Rae, we're not here to fix you or judge you. Only you and the Almighty can do that. But I want you to tell me about these spells you get.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie. (the emotion really hits hard) Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
I think... I think we're fucked up. Both of us. I know I am. But... that don't mean what I feel ain't true. It don't mean I can't love. And I know, how I been is... is... REALLY BAD! So if you want to quit on me... I understand. But please... please... don't.
So. What'chu two gonna do about this?
Hey.
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
What do you need?
I need ya help again.
More cough syrup?
Can I come in?
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
I do. God's truth. I do.
Now what'chu need me to do? Cuz I'm gonna go do it.
Yo, this here Pinetop. I think he got what you lookin' for.
That'll do.
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
 Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?
What are you doing?
 Just wanted to see.
You know the rules. (vacant look from Ronnie) You do know the rules, don't you?
Yeah, I know.
Then start taking them seriously.
Yes, ma'am.
It's okay to breathe, honey.
Yes, ma'am.
You Ronnie?
Yeah.
I'm Lincoln. Guess I'm gonna be your best man.
 Okay.
You havin' trouble with that tie? Cuz I'm pretty good at it.
Gotta do it like this or I get all turned around.
She's ready for you.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
I want to. More'n anything. But I...
Now... let's stop that.  You and me... we can handle this. You hear me, gal? We gonna be just fine. Now live ya life. Pull your shit together and live your life.
Okay.
I don't want you to let go.
Maybe I won't.
When I was a child, I talked like a child. I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child.
When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.
Now we see but a poor reflection as in the mirror; then we shall see face to face. I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
I do.
You got her now?
Ronnie. Rae. I want you to look at each other and listen to me carefully. Do you understand?
I require and charge you both as you stand in the presence of God to remember that love and loyalty alone will avail as a foundation of a happy and enduring home.  Go on, hand it to him.
No human ties are more tender. No vows more sacred than those you now assume.
If these solemn vows be kept inviolate, the home which you are establishing will abide in peace and your life will be filled with joy.
I gotta pull over.
 FUCK!
 You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy, when times are gray.
 You'll never know dear, how much I love you. Please don't take, my sunshine away.
See. We're okay.
