A seven-speed Mix-o-Meter Food Processor! $21.69!
Sweatpants! Two pair! $6.69!
Three-pack of men's elastic waist mid-thigh boxer shorts! $2.69!
Four Toby Jug beer steins - $2.69!
Shop UniMart! Where United, you save! Larry Crowne leads the High Fives.
Too much mac & cheese for this little pickle bug!
They do love the comfort food. Don't you, Li'l Pickle Bug... Imagine any duty and see how Larry gets it done...
Call a cop, doof. I'm gone in sixty seconds.  You guys having a party?
Finally. Dotty G. and her forty-two- K a year are history. Who else would do us that favor?
Wish they'd all sail off like her. Save us some grief.
The "R" Bomb is going to do some collateral damage to this place. Hurley is shocked!
"R-Bomb"? Oh my god! Restructuring?
Separating the chaff from the wheat. Chaff is the bad stuff, right?
Before E.O.Q. Them's our orders. Hurley looks sick. She hates this.
What say we drop a brick in the pond to warn the herd?
How?
Firing someone.
Someone they'd never expect to be let go. To look fair. I like it.
Like a Team Leader.
Team Leader?
Suggestions on who it should be?
I say Crowne.
Larry Crowne? Strang rolls his eyes.
Who else? Avery won't retire. We fire him, it's a law suit. AVERY - Old. Black. Happy.
Alvarez is about to drop a kid. She'll go part time in a week. ALVAREZ - Heavy with child.
What Salary Tier is Crowne at?
Top of the pyramid with a C.O.L. bump at the first of the year.
Sweet. We'll need Actionable Cause, of course. They all agree: "Yeah. Sure. Of course..."
How's his review record?
He's a candidate for Employee of the Month. His 22nd time.
Okay. So. Sluggers, gimme a reason... Larry has organized a Limbo Contest.
We could use the Limited Horizons strategy.
You're that familiar with his record?
She was his squeeze for a few weeks, weren't you, Vick?
That was before the New Employee Covenants. That you even remember...
The memory haunts me.
Big brick in the pond, though.
Let's call it. Today, end of shift, UniMart bids Crowne adieu. LARRY is dancing up a storm.
LC Why still here?
Team Leaders zone departments before punching out. It's policy.
I mean here here. You just got paged to Meeting Room 2. The P.A. blares again. Now they can hear it -- sort of.
Probably to clean up after the party.
Isn't it Employee of the Month Day? Larry brightens. That is what it must be.
Speck-tack-alar. Flushed at the prospect, Larry gives Terrorist Fist Bumps.
Ah, who's counting? He flashes his fingers: twenty two!
Remember how we saw "The UniMart Way" video, Vick? You and me, alone in this room, and look at us now. Hurley has a frozen face. Larry looks at Andrews' smile.
Cubby. Make tracks. The Janitor literally drops everything and leaves
I think I know what this is about.
I don't think you do.
Crowne. At UniMart, we care. So we take care. Which makes moments like these tough for all of us.
Sounds like you're firing me. Larry is joking.
I take it back.
Corporate has mandated a restructuring in all UniMart stores. That's the word they use. I call it a pain in the touchas.
Yeah. A yiddish word.
Like the buttocks.
Touchas and buttocks. Synonymous.
Hurts to get kicked back there, no matter what language you speak. Larry now gets it.
UniMart is firing me...
Crowne-ie, you did a heck of a job.
Why me?
Who do you suggest? Alvarez? Avery? I don't think so.
Why not Strang? Strang snorts.
I've been here longer than you, Jack. I started 21 years ago as an Inventory Associate at the store on Euclid. Hurley takes over, as blank as a tax-form.
Seniority would preclude this reality, Larry, but UniMart's policy is to never limit your horizons. Larry Crowne has no idea what that means.
Becasue you never went to college you're forever retarded.
I won't make the Front Office?
Never.  S. M. U. Class of '86! Go 'Stangs! It's true.
I went in the Navy. Right outta high school. Five years, and by then...
Thank you for your service to our country, Larry. And, in total seriousness to UniMart too
I thought I was Employee of the Month.
In a way, you are. Larry can't believe this. Nor can he move.
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I'm going to lose my house...
The timing on this is always a bitch.
Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. We can fix this. Can't we fix this?
Sign here. Here. Here. Initial that. Sign here. One more. Done. Strang finds one last piece of party pizza.
12 jerks I'd fire before you. May walk away from UniMart myself.
Stick it out. You go to college?
Couple years. Then I blew out my
Thanks for seeing me off.
I need your apron, man.
Thanks.
Laurie Gammelgaard thank you for holding how may I help you? Larry has to shout over the SCOOTER SQUAD ruckus.
I was holding for Barry Raphael in Home and Real Estate?
Mr. Raphael is no longer with the bank. How can I help you?
Barry is gone? I need to talk to someone in Home and Real Estate.
 I wish! I'm Customer number 566 7878 2031 339 and I can be there in three minutes!
As long as you are here before six, okey dokey. ZZZZZMMMM, BLAARREE... The scooters are gone, but Larry is still yelling...
Three minutes!
Barry Raphael was harassing the younger tellers but we are not supposed to admit that.
I m hoping not to lose my house.
You're carrying what on the house?
Two Ninety-two K. That's trouble. Three years ago I'd have loaned you $700,000, but I think you read the papers.
But RiverBank does have a plan for you.
That's RiverBank's plan for me?
It is Friday, Mr. Crowne...
Larry's home a little late tonight. His wife, PATIENCE, is sitting at the table, pouring over catalogs..
Maybe he was out on a date.
We'd see that on the news. He is about to light up with a match...
Don't even think about lighting that up in my house.
Unfolds like a piece of high tech assault equipment. The iron breathes hot fumes... spray starch plumes like jet exhaust. Larry Crowne is ironing his nicest shirt and his best khakis to perfection. He is focused. Intense. And good at ironing...
He gets right back into his car.
How do I offer this up to Personnel?
There should be a box to put it in. Larry finds a box.
This?
No. There should be another box.
There isn't.
That's the one, then. Larry is alone again - ignored as he applies for this job.
Just following up with an in-person visit.
Mission accomplished.
You have a great location here.
Not with UniMart half a mile away.
I used to work for UniMart! I could spill you some 411.
What's that mean?
I know their trade secrets.
What secrets? Traffic boosters, loss leaders and bait and switch!
And I'm ready to learn new strategies. I'll stop by again so you can keep me in mind.
If you won't work Sundays, don't bother.
I'll work every day.
That's what I already do... Mr. Patterson goes back to work as Larry slinks away.
Oh, I remember you. Larry Crowne. I never forget anyone who quits on me.
As I recall, I gave my notice and worked all my shifts and that was 12 years ago.
As I recall, I had to hire and train a line cook to take your place. Walking out doesn't happen in a vacuum, you know.
You come in two weeks ago I would have kissed you on the mouth, but Carlos and Nick, they walked in. Best I can do? Put you at the top of the list. Raul goes back to work.
Dang the timing, Kimosabe. Wish I could help you but Raul runs the back.
Not sure I could work here anyway. The atmosphere is too pleasant and the clientle too A Number 1.
Breakfast on the house. Chorizo Scramble, right?
No charity today. I got things to do.
Like what?
Nothing. I was just saying that.
There's been a yard sale at 1402 Derby Court since Monica Lewinsky! That gives me a monopoly on the location! You go yard on me, Larry Crowne and I will destroy you. He is now standing on Larry's lawn. Larry looks at him. Got fired yesterday.
Bloody Friday. Security sees you off, by the time Monday comes around the fired man is the forgotten man. Diabolical.
They said it's because I didn't go to college.
Smoke screen. The Man just wanted you gone.  You liquidating assets to raise cash?
Buying out Denise's half of the house was the worst advice, ever.
I'll tell you straight up - I'm not lending you money.
Inside his garage? Clothes and books - racks and shelves.
Whole box of Cha-Cha records from the Fifties. You don't have any of these, I promise.
He can't afford 'em Lost his job
No! UniMart just lost my business forever!
I love you too.
Sorry, Lie-bare-eye-bee. Get a better job somewhere so you can crush them.
Hard to do.
He's going to get something better than a job.
Aren't there unemployed engineers and geophysicists?
Listen to my husband. Hasn't called a man boss in years. Paid off the house.
You won the Lottery.
Picked 8 little numbers when I kept saying he was a fool. A quarter million dollars later I've shut up.
Lost half to taxes.
I'll see if there's a class in here for PowerBall 250.
That's half a buck for the book.
They give these away free.
They do. I don't.
Larry wants to shoot himself in the head. Instead, he picks up the catalog of East City College....
Back to college, huh?
First time. I was in the Navy.
Galley Mate.
We teach a whole track in Hotel and Restaurant Food Preparation.
No. No, no. I need an all-new career and a place to go everyday.
Those two things are my specialty. HALLWAY -- walking towards Busik's cubicle.
First thing. Bravo for choosing East City College. Never too late for an education. Second, you need a jolt to the confidence machinery. He grabs a folder...
I am going to change your life. 
Is this Public Speaking?
It's training. Job interviews will be a breeze with the confidence you'll get from Speech Two One Seven.  And you'll spend three hours a week with the most attractive package in all of Academia. The Golden Girl of East City.
Please Enter your destination.
I'm here. Shut up. Turn off! Stepping from her sub-compact, she struggles into a pair of heels, as in this state she drives barefoot. If only her huge Thermo-cup held a hair of the dog she might not walk such a crooked mile from the parking lot to the campus. Larry -- in his car -- screeches around a corner. He is frantically looking for a place to park, but as this is the first day of term, the lot is jammed! He nearly hits Mercedes Tainot.
Jerk!
Sorry! Parking's impossible today!
New to the Student Body.
This is the Faculty Lot. We've earned degrees for these spaces. Students park on Mars.
I'm going to be late for my first day of school.
I bet it won't be the first time.
This is it?
My day has just been made and it's only 8:02 in the morning!
Please tell me this is Speech 217. Mercedes drops her bag on her desk. She is crushed and hates Larry Crowne. She takes up some chalk, turns to the board, then writes in large, shaky-yet-feminine script:
While earning a Masters in Shakespearean Political Discourse from Vassar, I learned to care. Caring is a prerequisite for this class I have to teach in this
Participate. Show up on time.  Care. And stay awake the 55 minutes three dawns a week I have to be here, or I will fail you and not care.  My name is Ms. Tainot. Not 'tie- knot'. Tay-no. You will each address the class on Wednesday. A procedure. How. To do. Something. Pinedo has panic in her eyes. Public speaking terr fies her. Dibiasi raises his hand.
Ms. Tie-knot? Ms. Tainot glares at Dibiasi. Glares and glares at him.
Uh, Tay-knot...Tai-bo...
Steve Dibiasi. Friends call me Nomad. Only two days before I gotta get up and give my address? You may be dreaming.
Why are you here, Steve?
Counsellor Busik said this class would change my life.
Busik. Of course... Dibiasi's cell phone rings.
I gotta take this... Mercedes Tainot may kill this kid.
Look at us, in two classes in a row.
Yes. Hi.
That Ms. Tainot is something else isn't she? I'm new to this coll ge life and, I confess, she sca es e This whole place scares me.
Yes.
I'm sorry. Larry Crowne, and I'm babbling.
I am Lala.
I order you to turn off all cell phones, smart phones, and any phone- like devices! The teacher comes in - DR. MATSUTANI.
You have entered The Knowledge Zone!! Econ Prime! One textbook!  Written by? Ed Matsutani, PhD. That's me! Read this book Follow into the Promised Land!
(he laughs mock
That usually scares people. Yet none of you have fled. A good economic indicator. Larry leans over to Lala.
I like this guy...
Yes...
Mercedes has already written up on the board in Happy Letters
But no one else is showing up.
A body builder on a SCOOTER -- a guy we will come to know as DELL GORDO -- pulls in to the opposite pump. He flips up the seat, pops the pump into his scooter tank, and in seconds, is done. That scooter only sips gasoline. Off Dell goes, while Larry's tank fills and fills and fills...
What's cookin' Joe College?
Money woes. Paying for gas, getting to school.
Come with me.
Passing through, woman... Lamarr goes through the patio doors to the back yard, a space filled with even more yard sale items.
Larry Crowne, been thinking about you. Sit down here... Larry watches Vanna White turn letters - he solves the puzzle.
"College Graduate."
That's going to be you someday. She's pulled up some LP's on eBay on the computer.
You have money in all those records. If you can part with them, they'd go for something on the eBay. I'll show you how... From the back patio, Lamarr comes in pushing a scooter in not too bad of shape, though its windscreen is faded.
This what you're talking about?
That's a hunk of junk.
This is classic.
It doesn't work.
It will for eight hundred dollars.
Seven hundred.
Two hundred.
Six fifty.
Two hundred.
Six thirty.
Gonna be a long night with you two.
Forget it.
Larry! The secret of any negotiation is for both of us to win Talk to me How much do you
Beautiful. I'll throw in a helmet.
All I need is the open road. Larry revs it, crashes into a hedge.
You break it, you bought it.
Talking about the hedge.
Images of an EROTIC SUPER-HEROINE -- busty and hot -- and others, are being studied, and saved one after another.
Well, hey! Who's home early! He keeps clicking away with the mouse until he's safe. Mercedes calls from the other room.
First day of term calls for a celebration!
You'd think so.
What's your burden this go round?
Tap Dancing. Ping Pong. Water Torture. And Speech at Sunrise
I built a Flamethrower of a posting for WarriorWeb which, if I do say, will feed nicely as an outline for
Y u don't believe me.
Why wouldn't I believe you?
I was composing, Mercy. That's what I do all day.
You were looking at porn. She takes a nice pull on that icy drink. Oh fine. Thought Police. I saw some erotica. I'm a man, I admit it.
Took you a while.
It's barely porn. I'm not hiding it.
Yes you are. She bangs her head.
Brain freeze.
Don't chug. Sip.
I have no secrets from you. I share the whole miserable slate.
You walked in the door pissed off because -- I'm sorry -- I've
It may look like I don't work hard around here, Mercy. But I do. I'm just a guy who's a guy being a guy when you're not around... She walks away.
And walking away is great for a relationship...
Rap-rap-rap on the glass door. It's Dean, making one last point.
How you doing...
Speck-tack-alar.
Work.
School. College. I'm a student. What do you do?
I'm a gynecologist.
Yeah? I'd say 'have a great day' but that would be stating the
You take care. As the Rider takes off, Larry tries to do the same, but he stalls the engine. Cars honk horns at him.
Where'd you get the Hot Wheels? Talia is shaking her hair free from her helmet. Larry fails to recognize her from Econ prime.
That machine's a classic.
You're in Matsutani's Econ with me.
I am?
That class is straining my coconut.
It's only been one day
Didn't know you scooted.
New to the sport.
 Give me your number. I'll introduce you to like-minded enthusiasts.
Larry Crowne. With an 'e'.
'Larry'? I don't think so. I used to be Kathleen but one day I looked in the mirror and saw a girl named Talia.  Putting you in as 'Lance'. Check your texts and we'll do us some scooting.
Not much fashion sense.
I know! Gotta change that... Larry sees Mercedes Tainot walking from the Faculty lot, and doesn't want to be late again.
Then get going!! Talia watches him go. Likes him thus far...
With the push-up added, the 4-count Burpie becomes the 6-count Burpie and works out the pecs and biceps. It's an all-in-one exercise perfect for Cheerleader conditioning. The
We now all know how to Burpie. Thank you.
Make me the bad guy.
You mean me?
Mr. Crowne. My bad. Larry goes to the podium - armed with a huge stack of 3x5's.
Go.
My presentation will be on the subject of a very particular procedure. "How to make French Toast", but I'll speak English... Larry has used up one card. Mercedes rolls her eyes and talks to herself in a MOVIE DEVICE way...
M classes were once filled with e rnest young men ready to learn all I had to teach them. Cute boys fresh out of High School who all had crushes on me from day one. Now look at my cadre. Dibiasi. Bound for jail. Mack. Treating college like another tour of combat. Crowne. If this was Hamlet, he'd be Osric in Act 5. The part that is always cut.
Busik, I am going to kill you. You can't suggest these saps take Shorthand or Oral Hygiene? Bring me in at this ungodly hour for 2 minutes on French toast? Busik looks at Mercedes, signals a 'not bad, eh?' about Larry. She is a stone face.
Most people think syrup comes out of a plastic bottle.
 Great. The history of the sugar maple tree now. Thank you Wikipedia. Larry still has a dozen cards to go.
That went fast...
Breakfast may never be ready. Larry gathers his cards. Busik gives him a 'bravo!'
Next. Pinedo tries to volunteer to go next...
I'll go. But you aren't going to like it.
Are you clairvoyant?
(holding a pack of Toaster
Simple. Direct. Informative.
Your mobile, please. Larry hands it over.
I will return it after class if I don't crush it first.
Some of the Scooter Gang have assembled as Larry and Talia walk up. DELL GORDO and STAN are talking about today's route.
Hey Monkey! Dell Gordo plants a kiss right on Talia's lips. She kisses him back. Larry sinks a little.
This is Lance Corona. Classmate and good guy, so far.
Dell Gordo. You want to ride with us?
Why not. There is a beat of a stare down between Dell Gordo and Larry, but then Dell starts to snap his fingers -- SNAP...SNAP...SNAP... -- the other join in until they are all snapping fingers like the Jets vs. Sharks. Talia too.
Snap along, Lance or you can't join the gang. Larry, clumsily, starts snapping too. After a few bars...
Not many of these '66 Wasps left around. They had low torque. How's the torque? He means Larry's scooter.
I just bought it and ride around. Someone yells "Saddle up!"
Stan knows engines and junk.
Let's go, Sweets!
We ride, Monkey! Larry's heart breaks a tiny bit, suffering as he does from Talia-on-the-heart.
They make riding look fun... being in a group a gas... rolling with the wind in your hair something you'd like to do...
As Larry and the Squad pass it by, Larry can't help but eye the place he once worked. He sees staffers collecting carts in the parking lot. He misses that place...
Other than school, I have nothing to do.
Let's troll Buena Vista for junk stores.
We hit those last week.
If it was Saturday we'd look for yard sales.
I know where a yard sale is, like everyday.
Lead the way.
Take point!
Follow me, boys and girl!
We're being invaded! One by one, the Scooters park and survey the scene. The stuff that Larry was selling is now part of Lamarr's operation, being sold 'On Consignment'. .
Larry, what kind of thugs you get in with?
College buddies.
You have any old clothes?
Speak to my bride inside. Dell Gordo, Stan and the others are going through hardware, tools, appliances.
Oh man! These TV trays are too much!
Bargains at $100 apiece.
For these? Are you nuts?
I'm joking, kid. Let's get to haggling.
Ninety-nine dollars apiece. see how this is working?
Two bucks apiece!
Ninety-eight and, kid, I do this every day.
Layer this... with this.
I LOVE THIS! Where did you GET IT?
Reeled it in like tuna from the Atlantic.
Diamonds in a diamond mine.
You and I are going to spend some time together!
I gotta see Chez Lance.
Entrez vous, sea food plate. Talia enters and looks around. The decor screams out: "A man lives here."
No sign of a woman around here for years. Drape a scarf over that
Alphabetical order. No artistic chaos for you. She closes her eyes and picks out an LP at random.
Spin this platter, Mr. DJ?
Good choice. As he puts it on, Talia drifts into the...
Breakfast nookie!
Did Denise make you breakfast in here with a little apron and lipstick perfectly applied?
I did most of the cooking, actually.
Patience thought she was stuck up and seriously fleeced you. Larry can't believe his neighbors are so loose-tongued.
So what happened there, my Lance?
The usual stuff between three people.
Dark.
Like me.
Stay outta my way.
Cooking for friends is sort of fun. Three hundred times a day is not.
That corn bread I smell?
Kitchen, Monkey! Dell Gordo has walked into Larry's house.
Corn pone! Dell Gordo dives in after helping himself to a bottle of beer from the refrigerator.
You're like Uncle Ben or something. Stan's working on your bike.
He is? Larry goes to the window.
Said the thing was a time bomb. He's saving your life.
Let's go lift iron, Monkey. It's a shoulders and arms day
Lance, raise your right hand and say something patriotic. Larry does, just for fun.
'We'll be right back after these messages.'
You're in the Street Patrol. A full-time mission for beauty and justice. Talia throws her arms around him and kisses him on the lips -- no romance at all, but still...
That Denise. What a fool. You a e way cooler than you appear. She leaves. Dell Gordo lingers.
Capice.
Seriously. Don't make me keep my eyes on you. What's your real name?
L rry.
Mine's Don. Shake hands.
Peace indeed.
Speck-tack-alar. He peels out, on his way to school.
Even business can break down into a Shakespearean Five-Act Structure!
Act I: Inventory. What do you sell? Act Two? To Market. Reach your buyers. Act Three? Three legs of accounting. Receivable. Payable. Due. Act Four? Forward planning. Plan to grow. Act Five? Final Profitability. What do you clear on bottom-line?
Dibiasi is doodling drawings of football players.
For business, social, and self- improvement workshops, email me: Francestaylor-briegh@dynasem.com. Mercedes Tainot is in the back -- her mind far from her classroom. She is preoccupied. The applause for the speaker jolts her.
Did you notice? No script. No notes. So it can be done. The class breaks up. Pinedo makes it a point to pick up some DynaSem brochures. Larry remains, scribbling notes.
White, Siler and Koss, you are up
Anything for the woman who brought out the public speaker in Frances Taylor-Briegh.
Mr Crowne? Can you move along
That was a great presentation. I learned a lot from it.
Super.
Smart stuff. Super smart. The women watch him go. As soon as he's out the door:
Ethel's here, Lucy. What's going on?
When was the last time you looked at your life and saw nothing but fraud and desperation?
Mercy. You're an idol to me. Hearing you talk like that is
Well I'm joking of course!!! She pretends to laugh. A little too much.
If the balance on Axis A is the same metric as Axis B you're in deficits because of overhead, taxes, and re-investment.
Something complicated.
Ms. Pinedo?
Mr. Crowne?
Breaking even is not making profit, it's a theoretical assumption. Economics abhors an assumption. Talia is amused while sizing him up, from shoe to collar. Bad shirt... pleated pants, too short... running shoes.
Someone's been reading my book.
So what happens here?
You ready? Re-invention Big Boy
I have no idea what that means, but you betcha.
Holy smokes! The place is crammed with vintage clothes. Racks and boxes and stacks of every fashion.
You got inventory. She disappears in the back, rummaging around.
I started in the smallest unit.
No one should ever buy clothes off the internet. You have to feel the fabric and test the drape...
What is all this worth? Out she ome with an assortment of men's clothes.
A lot to me. Try these on.
Where?
Anywhere. Fashion is no place for modesty. Strip. He does.
This is a service to humankind, Lance. It hurts me to see a Top Cat dressed like an ex-hockey player. You gotta look gorgeous from shoe to collar. Starting now. Larry is taking off his pants just as Dell Gordo has pulled up on his scooter.
Monkey! Thought you might be here.
Lance! My boyfriend's here! Put your pants on! Larry, in fact, has his pants off.
Go to hell...
Candles. Flowers. In other words, he's making up.
No argument here, Mercy. Fact: I'm a dope. Fact: My wife is beautiful and brilliant. And I will be a good boy from now on. Why? Because you're right and I've learned my lesson. Just don't be mad at me forever. I have a pliable soul and I pray you do too
Ah. That was nice.
It was. Yes.
Been thinking. If you ever want to take a whack at writing something -- say a blog a couple of times a week -- I could help you out.
How?
I'd read your stuff. Make comments to make it web-savvy. Pieces need
Okay.
See? You can't stay mad at me. No reason to be mad at me... He smooches her. Mercedes smooches back.
I'm just a guy who's a guy being a guy... Mercedes' eyes: She didn't like hearing that...
This is Denise. How can I help you.
Denise. Larry.
My god. Larry Crowne. I remember you.
This a good time?
Other than me being at work?
I'll call you later.
I'm surprised is all. What do you want? With checkbooks, statements, etc. Larry is looking for the bottom line.
Well. Okay. Uh. Here's the deal.
Spit it, Lar.
I'm going to miss a few months on the checks for the house.
Okay.
I hoped not to, but I there it is.
Okay. Yeah.
I'm sorry.
How many months?
Let's start with six. Silence on the other end.
That can't happen, Larry. I'm extended. I've put a deposit down on the first vacation I've had in 5 1/2 years. My expenses are as valid as yours, so I need the checks like always. A deal's a deal. He goes back to the computer, to eBay to see how his LP auction is going. One record is going for... $0.75. Another: $1.25. Another:
That's not my problem. Take out a loan on the house or something.
I tried. I'm too much of a risk.
Oh, I'm not touching that. I don't want to open up the whole lawyer thing, but I will if pushed. Sucks, doesn't it? I appreciate the rigorous Crowne honesty, but this can't happen.
Can I smell trouble or what?
Can you speak English?
Those two over in booth 6... P.O.V.: Two GUYS IN SUITS.
Homeland Security. I piped thei badges and everything.
What is Homeland Security doing here... Raul looks back in the kitchen. Carlos and Nick are prepping their stations. Raul bolts for the kitchen. In seconds we can see him through
Out side the window, Carlos and Nick are fleeing for their Illegal Alien lives...
Perry is serving hotcakes to the Agents while Raul is on the phone.
This is Larry Crowne?
Raul? Yes.
Get your ass down here. You got a job.
I do?
We're swamped, Kimosabe. Get back there!
You're late on your first day!
Where you learn to turn eggs like
The USS Coral Sea.
So don't.
I gotta get to class before I miss the whole day. And I can't work mornings Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays.
Soon as the rush is finished, go. I'll get my idiot brother-in-law three days a week. You take evenings. Deal?
Deal. When will we talk salary?
These are not toys. Nobody 'plays' with these. These are kept behind glass, so no way am I passing them around today. Mercedes TALKS to us and HERSELF.
Wait a ding dong minute.  1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9. Someone is missing! Who cut my class? She lets slip OUT LOUD:
Where's Larry Crowne?! Everyone looks at her.
Guess Larry's out today.
Anyone know why?
He didn't call me. Ad-libs: no one knows why Larry is out.
I don't believe this! Ditching me? He ditched me? Not okay. Larry Crowne, you are on my Shit List. Everyone shares looks like they've witnessed a Lover's Spat. Speaking quietly in their seats...
Sounds like Teacher has a thing for a Teach-ee.
I do too.  He's a nice man. Mack speaks up.
Should I continue?
Yes. Tell us more about your man dolls. Mack is humiliated now.
I'm sure everyone recognizes Boba Fett...
This is college, Mr. Crowne. The only thing you can't do is smoke in the building. Hand over your phone.
Without mooting the quarterlies. I know.
Then say it.
Can I?
To up... met... es without ...ing ...terly predicts....? No one understood that...
I know what you mean, but please share it with your classmates?
Does this affect the Value Index?
Someone is doing the reading! Lala Pinedo beams! Larry applauds. Talia whoops!
Is that Larry Crowne!?
I'm sorry, Ms. Tainot. I will not miss another class, this I vow.
Vows come cheap, Larry Crowne. You'll lead off next assignment with three minutes on a personal first. A story, with details, not a laundry list or slide show. And, as I told Dibiasi, no one wants to hear about the first time you got laid. She eyes Talia with venom in her eyes.
Or the most recent. Talia laughs out loud!
That woman is one clenched fist of fury.
She must not be having any amok lovin'.
Without a workout in the Inner Sanctum a few times a week I can't concentrate.
Inappropriate subject in mixed company.
You you want to fix it with your teacher? Bang her. Talia slides a photo of herself making a face into Larry's wallet, then adds a condom in its foil.
She's marred.
You'd kill two birds in one bush. Nothing wrong with a campus romance. Otherwise life is what? Breakfast work, coffee, school, lunch, scoot, class, shop, talk, Mexican food, a movie, glass of wine or two then bed? That's not living.
Bet she'd give you an A plus.
More complimentary coffee?
Complimentary coffee is usually lousy.
I drink it all day.
I got a job.
Atta Baby!
Perry's Coffee shop. Breakfast all day. And I'm going to school.
At East City. I see.  Larry, this doesn't change anything.
I was afraid of that.
The interest alone will eat up your service industry salary.
Okay.
I can't make the payments on the house. I'm going to lose it, aren't I?
Stop with the gloomy puss. You're doing everything right. Hang in there. You still have a friend at RiverBank.
You guys are forced to say that, aren't you?
Coming down in buckets. Talia has the grate up, wrapping a new outfit for Larry culled from her supply. Dell Gordo is in a rain slicker.
I think it's letting up.
It's going to storm till next year.
We can't stay here all day. Find a raincoat and let's get a little wet.
I do not scoot in the rain.
My savior! Look at your new schmatas.
I got engaged to a teacher/writer with two books in print...
I never read them.
Who did? I'm married to an ex- teacher turned blogger with two books in print. And oh, yes, he has the libido and internet access of a 13-year-old.
I had a boyfriend who owned every movie Sophia Loren ever made. I d hear a DVD go into the playe an knew what I was going to be doing in a half-hour. Right next to them, Larry Crowne pulls up in his Karmann Ghia with the top up and Talia in the passenger seat.
Othello. Act 1. Scene 1. Iago to Roderigo. Talia jumps out and runs into the donut shop.
Why can't all my students be like y u?
Because, as I learned in your class, I am one of a kind. Larry rolls down his window and yells something funny to her. He never sees Mercedes or Frances.
Hey, that guy's in your class. Mercedes wipes fog off the window.
Talia is talking to the Donut Shop Lady, selecting crullers and old-fashioneds.
And that Toy Poodle he keeps on a leash! Mercedes eyes Larry in his car.
That's why he's in college! To get laid!
It happens. Talia comes running out, with two coffees and a bag of donuts, hops into Larry's car and they pull out as Talia puts a ring of sweet into his mouth. Mercedes rolls down her window and yells.
Woah! Larry Crowne, I didn't know you were gay. You've gone all Project Runway on us. Mercedes enters, eyeing Larry with residual venom. He is oblivious. She takes her listening post in the back of the room as the class goes quiet.
Should I begin? Mercedes signals 'Yeah, go ahead, asshole.'
first crossing of the Equator...
(talking to herself in the MOVIE
Oh shut up you sleaze. Jerk.
 What? What he say?
Unless you're looking at a chart, you don't even know the Equator when you cross it...
A repackaged Larry Crowne won't fool me. Shame on you. Going after jail bait, you criminal. Insert Viagra joke here...
Anyone recall anything from that?
That Larry believed there were signs on posts marking the Equator.
And that, when it's a first time, they make the rookies dress in drag and sing Abba songs? Mercedes missed a lot of that. Everything, in f ct.
Larry worked on an Aircraft Carrier! Night Carrier Landings are the trickiest flying in world. Mercedes is learning this for the first time as well.
That was a memorable nugget.
Mr. Koss to the lectern, please. More anecdotes come from the class about Larry's speech. Mercedes heard none of them...
Chef Corona! Steam us some corn bread? The others pretend to be grumpy diners: Feed us! What's a Reuben Sandwich? Where's my Sanka!
Woman on deck! Raul looks up from his Spanish Language Newspaper.
You can't come in here.
I'm a friend of Lance's.
No Lance works for me. Talia hops up to sit on a butcher block.
This is my kitchen and I am the boss.
Is he, Lance?
Rah-ool. Rhymes with ya-cool. Are ya' cool, Raul?
Sure I'm cool. Tough but fair, too.
As boss, do you make up the menu?
Is that a tough but fair job?
Talia is with Perry at the register. She's seduced him now, as he goes over the menu and what sells more than ever.
Breakfast all day, see. From Corn Flakes to popovers. We make the best Chicken Fried Steak outside of a truck stop.
Can Lance take a break?
Who?
The artist formerly known as Larry. I need his expertise.
Square footage at this price is a bargain.
Maurice says I'm saving his life by renting the space.
You sure?
Chapter four.
You make it sound so simple!! Talia is so excited she grabs Larry and showers his forehead with kisses. Appearing out of nowhere: Dell Gordo.
I'm smiling...
Like The Joker after three Apple Martinis.
If they help, they help.
We can't even have a Date Night now? You can't even chillax for one meal?
"Chillax?" Did you use the word "chillax?" That come from your Bloggers Thesaurus?
Please Enter your destination.
You lie to me, Dean. Every day. You. Lie. To. Me.
You looking for a whole new man, Mercy? I'm the jerk who has to transform into Ultraman to make you happy? No. I like myself, Mercy. I put up with you and complain about nothing.
I'm not complaining. I'm stating the truth. I teach while you pretend to work.
I had three postings today alone. FogCaster, SkyScan, and ParsecTwelve.com
Hey, Booze-illa, who are you to judge me?
Maybe I should take that back.
As soon as I saw you, I said, "I want to go out with that man."
What did you say when I asked you out?
I said "Yes." You were there, remember?
I saw you and I thought "I would be a lucky guy if she'd go out with me."
Yes you are.
Honestly, this is about as good a first date goes, isn't it?
Hold that thought. Dean and Mercy pull up beside them in their car.
I take it back. I take it back.
Drive, asshole! Drive away!
I've been drinking, too.
Drive straight til you hit a cliff on the coastline!
You win! I'm letting you win! Everything you say is right and
LOSER! I MARRIED A LOSER!!! With a tiny dick! Tiny dick LOSER!
Screw you, you washboard!
Oh, chillax!!!
Please enter your destination. Dean screeches off into the night. Mercedes picks up a rock and hurls it at him.
I'm throwing rocks at my own car !! Janet and Tony are aghast - silent - in shock.
The jerk who just deserted me? My husband of 4 friggin' years! She stomps off into the night. Janet and Tony don't know what to do with each other now.
I loved these shoes once. Stupid shoes. She sits at he stop, about to cry. Then she sort of does cry, for so any reasons. In the distance, we hear...
All the REGULARS go by. Somewhere in the mix are Larry and Talia. Talia is just able to turn her head and see Ms. Tainot at the bus stop. She slows.
Lance! Chick alert! Larry is beside her. They stop.
You are not going to believe how Fate meets cute! She u-turns and Larry follows her, confused.
Ms. Tainot?
No. He takes off his helmet.
Jesus Christ.
And I've been calling you 'Lance'.
Do you need a ride? Hop on.
And bust up your romp in the glen with Bambi?
Hey. Bambi was a boy.
I was heading home.
Not me. I love riding in the night. Magic happens.
What do men see in irritating free spirits? Mercedes starts walking.
Seriously. I offer you a ride.
Seriously. I don't want one. Larry shuts off his scooter, pushing it along with his feet
I've yet to give anyone a lift on this but I think I can get you home with a scraped elbow, worst case.
I am walking, Crowne, as thoughts black boil up from my soul. Major
An attractive woman like you walking alone is a dumb idea.
I need a man flirting with me right now like I need a dog crapping on my lawn. I'm hoofing it.
In those shoes? Mercedes ponders her shoes. He's got her. She stops.
A man who notices shoes.
Put this on.
It won't be a terrible thing if you kill us both.
Ain't you a ball of fun? Larry kick starts the scooter and off they go -- slowly.
Are you really going to go this slow?
I do want to survive this night.
Fine. I have time to window shop. Oh look, a sale on tires at AutoUSA. And here comes a mailbox. I've never noticed their perfect design and colo scheme. This is
Where am I taking you?
Down to Portola and left to Havenhurst. Havenhurst to Palermo. Right on Palermo till I yell stop.
I may use this as a presentation in class.
Try it and you'll flunk. I am joking.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
I like your class. You're making us all do things we never thought we could.
Put the shovel away and just get me home, 'kay? Up ahead, flashing lights.
Hail our City's Finest.
Someone's getting pinched... A COP CAR with its cherry top flashing, has pulled over a Drunk Driver. It's Dean. They're making him touch his nose, breathe into a test kit. Mercedes starts laughing.
Measure his dick, officer! He's too diminutive to drive!
Bad night for that guy.
Best night I've had in years! Drive on, McDuff!
Unit 114.
Thanks for the ox-cart ride. Like a sleepwalker. Stands at the Alarm Pad.
I can see the Alarm Pad. I know the code. But my hands aren't working.
You don't want to give me your pass code.
Look away now.
W ere's my purse? Oh yeah. My car. The key please? It's buried in that plant. Larry digs out an Altoids tin. Rattles it.
This it?
Why I think it is!
I'll get the door for you Larry opens the door, reaches in, turns on the light.
Take one step inside and I call security. Larry steps away from the door.
And forget this ever happened.
What?
This whole sorry chapter tonight.
What?
You passing up Gidget for a flat old coot like me.
What are you talking about?
Larry has been tying to be polite.
When I say 'what', it means I get it and have already purposefully forgotten everything. Call it irony.
Sarcasm. Irony is when Gallant lands in the drunk tank while Goofus scoots me home.
Goodnight, Ms. Tainot. She doesn't move, but flashes her ring finger.
Mrs. I'm Mrs. Tainot. Can you not see that?
I assumed you preferred Ms
When we presume we make a pretty pair of asses of me and you or something like that.
That's a long story and it's late.
Help yourself. She sticks her neck out. If this were a movie, they might kiss right now. Larry pauses. Mercedes looks at him. He's not a bad looking guy. He starts to undo the helmet strap.
I noticed something on the ride.
You smell good.
Thanks. He gently removes the strap and helmet from her head. be a bit sexy. Her hair tumbles out.
Do you have a crush on me? Single student. Unattainable teacher. It's common. Larry has no idea what to say.
We all have crushes on you. Even the gals.
You want to make out with me, you can. I know I'm not a third rate Audrey Hepburn wanna-be but I still
Come on, Gramps. Take this ride.
My spouse won't be home for 3 to 5 years. Larry ponders this moment for as long as he can. He shouldn't, of course. But, damn. She is Mercedes Tainot. Bang.
Larry pulls back. After a bit, though. She could have kept at it, too.
Wow...
Pretty dang good. I still got it, no?
Yes, you do..
Goodnight, whoever you are!
Whoever I am...
Oh, Jesus Hell and tomorrow...
As she straightens up, her eye catches...
Still, she keeps and eye on Larry. And pursues...
Then she sees her.
Is crushed. For the obvious reasons sh s ill can't understand. She was hoping to have Larry to herself for a minute or two.
Epilog. School today.
Lance! A Betty on your Scooter after midnight? Holding on, her arms around you, pressed against your back, is a license to at least cop a feel.
If we had ended up making out, you still wouldn't hear it. Talia slugs him. All in play...
Seeing them -- the Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis -- should have been beyond me, but I was a little girl in Coach class still awake, a window seat, a moonless night somewhere over Greenland with a shimmering curtain of emerald, gossamer light dancing just for me.
Mr. Crowne? A moment please?
Why doesn't she just throw herself at him?
This is bordering on harassment now.
Quiet down. I'm watching the TV show...
Why doesn't this ever happen to me?
I need a few moments alone with Mr. Crowne thank you.
Move along folks. Privacy's a right in this great nation of ours.
You want I should close this door, lock it, and barricade it so you won't be disturbed?? We hear them cackling like geese in the hall.
How are the Triplets? Groggy, Puffy, and Grumpy. He means the hangover.
Last night was a confluence of too many things happening in too short
Last i ht? Let's see, what was I doing? Studying some. Working some. Can't recall. I've forgotten everything that happened last night as best a gentleman can.
I had no right to judge you or your relationships. Date who you want. Larry has no idea what that means.
But what happened last night -- between adults -- was inappropriate. If gossip were to circulate, the problem could be more than just embarrassing. My status as a professor could be tarnished.
I wouldn't want that.
happened before.
With parking attendants. Strangers at parties when I've had a bit too much of the demon rum. This was the first time with a student.
Sure. Nothing happened. At all.
So there will be no bravado among you and your pals?
None.
Thank you, Mr. Crowne.
Larry leaves - a good mood ruined... Mercy watches him go. What is going on behind those dark glasses?
Puff. Don't suck. Then... relax.
I have to sell my car. Put a new top on it.
If I could afford a new top I could afford to keep it.
What's the job paying you?
Half my UniMart salary.
You're down, Larry Crowne. Down as dirt.
I'm looking back on the year Denise left as the good old days.
Hang in there, neighbor.
Everyone keeps saying that.
The odds of two people on the same street winning the lottery are worse than one person on the street winning the lottery.
I read how the universe is expanding, Larry, taking us along with it. That is a wild concept to grasp, but what it means is, we all have to hold on tight sometimes to get to where we're going to be.
Keep your grip. You'll be okay. It's like the wife always says... Shoppers pull up to Lamarr's Yard Sale. The WIFE has a
A woman with a measuring tape? That's money in my pocket. A ball flies in and hits Larry smack in the head, sending his pipe flying.
Vasquez - Security - is gone, replaced by Cubby -- the former Janitor who is now the skinniest SECURITY GUARD in history. Larry slides the signs for purchase. Manning the thing? Vicky Hurley. Not looking good
' ind bargains today?'
Vick? How you doing? Larry Crowne. Hurley looks at him. She looks tired. And stupid in her Cashier's Apron.
Larry. Hi.
Why are you on the Register?
Management Execs are now required to put in 8-hour shifts on the floor. Every day. No overtime. No bonus. Just more hours. Cash or UniMart Bargain Card? Like you have one of them.
Cash. No receipt. Hurley is robotic.
You got out of here just in time... 'Thank you for choosing UniMart, where united we blah blah.'
Thanks for coming.
No notice. No preamble. Just an email and a google map.
I knew you'd be on the computer.
Point made.
Are we making a mistake here?
Point made. We could change things. We could start right now.
We could. Why should we?
Because we have history, Dean. But first, my thoughts... I've got to address drinking. I should be able to comprehend and respond to both sides of our conversations. And the morning shower should be refreshing, not a hangover cure.
I'd like that too.
Really?
You're not a pleasant woman after a
Okay. Now, you. Dean is caught short.
I see. I'm what this is all about.
There are plenty of items on the relationship agenda but let's start here.
You're talking about you but you really mean me.
I'm not saying that.
We've both been here before. Why prolong the process? White flag! I give up. This ain't working.
I don't think there is anything else to talk about. Do you?
Here I have surprise topics. Friday, in a Lightning Round, you must wax on that topic for 2 minutes without pause, repetition, or lack of charm. No notes. One visual aid.
'Potatoes?'
Spuds. Can't wait. Dibiasi draws a paper.
'Disraeli'? What is that?
Who is that?
It's a guy from Disrael. I'm done. Now it's Larry's turn. He shyly draws a paper -- a bit uncomfortable in class since the recent events.
'Consumerism'.
The handwriting is loopy. Looks like 'Consumerism'.
Fine. 2 minutes on Consumerism. Calimeris picks. Hers is loopy, too.
'Malpity Hoople.'
No idea. Just pick another.
By now you should be laughing with me. Larry can't believe Talia is not there...
You missed Matsutani's class. Review for the final.
I'm done w th college.
What? Why?
Because I'm going into business.
Talia. Don't be a fool. Stay in school. Don't throw away your education.
And don't drink and drive or do drugs and quit smoking and eat vegetables. I don't. I stopped. I did. I do.
Pretty much. Oh, look. Maurice gave us free tattoos. I wanted something in Japanese so check this out. She shows it to him, just above her butt-crack. It's two Japanese characters.
That one says 'courage'. That one says 'spirit'. Courageous Spirit. Dell Gordo knocks on the window as Larry has his hands on his gal's butt... "What's this, Lance??"
Japanese characters go the other way and that says Soy Sauce.
Oh shut up.
Be here for our Grand Opening!
Might not make it. I have finals!
This place anonymous enough?
As long as alcohol's out of my grasp.
They have good pie, they say.
Great. Sugar can replace tequila in my bloodstream, my thighs, and the folds in my neck. They pass a car prominently parked - Larry's Convertible Karmann Ghia with a sign on its windshield: "FOR SALE BY
Yep.
You'd think leggy blondes like us would be impervious, right? At that moment, Larry Crowne happens to come out of the kitchen to help himself to a cup of coffee. Mercedes sees him just as Perry comes up with menus.
Ladies. Bring an appetite?
The mark of a restaurant is their Key Lime pie. Mercedes is surprised to see Larry in a chef's hat.
No Key Lime?
Cream pies I got.
Boston Cream?
Boston Cream? Key Lime? Lady, you're killing me here.
Phooey. Peach. Peach pie.
Ma'am?
I'll have the French Toast.
French Toast?
You won't believe how far I fell on the Hooch-o-meter.
I have seen it happen a time or two.
I kissed a boy.
When, third grade?
One of my students.
You Hoor.
Older than me.
Hugh Hefner in your class? What went down?
He sort of... rescued me. And... he smelled nice.
He a fireman who bakes bread?
I wanted to be kissed so asked if he wanted to and he did.
Bold. Who is he?
She's insane.
Take it up with her. Larry heads out of the kitchen.
No shouting, okay? This is a family friendly establishment.
Frances Taylor-Briegh. You have a problem with your order?
Mrs. Tainot.
This is Larry Crowne.
There's no way in creation I screw up French Toast.
It was fine, actually.
You'll be the judge of that. The is a beat of silence.
So, your meal is satisfactory?
Absolutely.
Would you let my boss know so I don't lose this job?
Yes indeed.
Shall I prepare you another batch?
No. Thanks.
Then I will return to my station.. Mercedes watches him go.
You kissed the cook...
Look at the men in my life.
Blame it on the booze... and collect yourself.
That's my problem. I'm a drunken hoor.
MUSIC is playing as these girlfriends reconstruct Mercy's life...
What a difference from day one. I must be a better teacher than I thought.
I was tough on him. But he learned fast. How he connected the Circle of Sales to the expanding universe is impressive as hell. I'll never forget about the Value Index now. He gave a perfect speech.
I'm so sorry. Please go on.
Larry? It okay if I get to my climax and denouement? Larry nods.
Thank you... If it was the romance novelist in him that made Victoria the Queen become such a pal, chalk it up as another brick in the legacy of Ben Disraeli -- Earl of Beaconsfield - Educator - and Prime Minister of Great Britain. Not bad for a Jewish guy, huh? Dibiasi is done. Applause.
Not so much as a bump, Nomad! Why'd you go last?
Fourth quarter dramatics.
Congratulations all of you.
Who's the MVP, Mrs. Tainot? Can we vote?
Not me, I have to stay objective.
I say... Lala! They all say Lala! It's unanimous! They start chanting her name. "La la! La la! La la!" -- embarrassing her. Larry sits her down in her chair and gets the other guys to pick her up like she's the bride at a wedding.
The first to finish. No surprise. Dr. Matsutani hands Larry his confiscated phone. Larry leaves.
He sits for a moment -- in the breakfast nook -- surveying his kitchen, what was once his. Mack comes in with a box of his LP's.
This is the last of them. Damn, you have a lot of records.
Priceless at a buck apiece.
Selling this futon-sofabed? All those years across the street and you've learned nothing.
You'll get me top price.
You did learn.
Pizza at last!
Here's lunch as promised! The BIG STORK PIZZA GUY pulls up in a different car but the same sign.
Son of a cock. Larry Crowne. The Pizza guy is none other than Jack Strang.
Jack Strang. Wow. This is irony.
Two extra large. One Salad Bucket. Box of Frosty Cinnamon Eggs. Sixteen- fifty. Larry hands him the coupon and a Twenty.
Jack. I need two bucks back. Times are tough.
Tell me about it.
Ah. Forget it. Keep the change.
My next wife just walked in. Perry looks.
I love this business sometimes.
Larry, your Speech 217 teacher has a question about the menu. Larry can see her. She looks gorgeous.
Go ahead. I'll take the window even though I'm the boss of the whole kitchen.
There's Larry Crowne. Are you allowed to sit?
I add chicory and a bit of vanilla. Trick I picked up in the Navy.
Actually, everybody got an A, but you got the special A where I tell you in person.
Didn't expect that. Thanks, Mrs. Tainot.
Class is out. Call me Mercedes. Or Mercy, for short.
No. I meant the... never mind.
This has turned into a full time gig. Out of necessity.
I hope you continue your education. Back at East City. You've made such a good start.
I'll have to see.
I got Speech 217 moved to 10 AM, thank God. Who knows what I'll hear with the extra sleep.
They look at each other.
Should get going.
Cars not much. Devices some. They rise.
Please enter your destination.
Oh be quiet. That's a MapGenie.
It is Hellspawn.
In my old job, I'd have steered you to a Vortex unit. The MapGenie interface is clumsy and the menu needs too many inputs. He is reaching into the car, across her to tap the unit.
It was working fine. Then I think I pressed too many buttons.
Ah. The Auto On Feature is engaged. Menu. Select. Features. Auto Voice. Select. Change? Yes. On. Off. Done? Yes. Save. Back. Back. Back. Exit. While he was doing that, Mercedes was smelling what she could of Larry. She liked it. She looked at his neck, his ears. And smelled him.
Seemed like years and years.
All better now. Should be able to find your way. Nothing to do now but say goodbye.
My Boss. Back to work.
Kimosabe, holding off til after school to woo the teacher is the move of a class act. Larry turns to watch Mercedes drive away.
Did you notice? The cost of an education just went up...
Only 6 students are enrolled. She's going to lose this one, again. Clumps up the wooden steps are heard...
 I gotta get off, Baby, or I'm in hot water with Professor Tai-bo... Mercy does a Shakespearean dance of joy.
Is Larry with you?
Um, no. Should we track him down and drag him in here? Mercedes does her best to hide her disappointment.
I... Seeing you all... I just thought...
Carrying a torch for Larry til it burns her hands...
All the excitement of first day of term, I don't want to go back to my empty apartment. Do you? I need a drink and some talk and some wind- down time. Don't you?
Ms. Tainot? She turns.
Larry Crowne is taking six units from me, devouring the material like a starving man.
Larry's enrolled?
He's continuing his education and tells me it is because of you. That your class changed his life. Mercedes finds herself smiling -- beaming...
Larry said that about me?
Oh yeah! I put that guy in your class. So technically, I changed his life.
He is a good student
And handy on a scooter.
Well, no. No offense Dr. M.
The rumor is you are newly single and I was just taking a shot. Mercy looks right at Busik.
News travels fast. Busik pretends he knows nothing...
If you're going out, I'm not doing
Have you ever been to Hooters?
For the spicy wings, yes!
Her breath catches in her heart...
Right Turn.
Got it Turning right
Your destination is ahead on the right.
It is? That was a breeze. Thank you.
I'm Mercy Tainot
Bambi Romp in the Glen. Looking for Lance?
4225 Harbor?
This is 4227.
Little higher heels'll get you wolf whistles.
Did you tell Ed Matsutani taking my class changed your life?
How?
I met you. That's it.
The most beautiful woman ever to wear a bathrobe has made French Toast and is settling into the Breakfast Nook. Larry Crowne has his hair all on one side of his head -- post- Afternoon-Of-Amok-Loving. His arm shows a Navy tattoo that may be old or new... Mercy Tainot glows in and out. She slides next to him, close to him The meal is perfect
