Slingshot this is Watchdog. Rabbit's home.
Roger watchdog. Understand we are go for crossbow.
 Watchdog, Slingshot. let us know when the rabbit's in the hole.
The shuttle pilot climbs into his seat, straps in and checks his instruments.
All systems check. Crossbow is armed.
Roger, Ignition sequence, start, separation in five...
Crossbow is established.
Roger, we have ground confirmation. Reference grid seven. Check pathfinder, on.
Roger, I'm going on the scope. Moving Target Indicator, engage.
PILOT'S POV OF THE SCREEN Crosshairs, a grid patter and digital, rangefinder readouts appear over various parts of the Earth's topography as the pilot searches for his target. Then it steadies on a polarized image of a group of people. One of the images seems to stand out brighter than the others.
 Scanner on. Target locked. Tracking locked.
Nice and easy does it.
I'm coming home. Just like shooting ducks in a barrel.
The Crossbow Project. There's no defense like a good offense.
Nice little weapon isn't it, Dave?
Well, I guess so, but gosh, Don, it's a movie. You want me to start buying weapons from George Lucas?
Now that would be somethin', wouldn't it?
Well, sometimes I think I might as well.  What do you think of what you saw, Roy?
I think there weren't enough girls. More polite laughter. Then Roy turns ice cold in a flash.
Is this thing for biological targets only?
No, Sir, this thing would take the skin right off, of Air Force One if you wanted. Not that I'm saying we'd ever want to kill our own President, but, you know, for example.
Our studies indicate that this type of weapon is totally useless for warfare.
It's not intended for use in your kind of warfare, Roy. This is a perfect peace time weapon.
What's the kill potential?
As soon as the size-to power ratio is licked we'll have about seven bangs for the buck.
When that?
Seriously, Don, I have to report to the Secretary that everything's on schedule. We have plans for your little ray's gun this summer.
 As I understand it, guys, there's some major practical difficulties. I'm pushing as hard as I can.
Well, Don, you tell those geniuses you've got until the end of the next fiscal quarter to come up with a working model or I'm pulling the plug on the funding.
 I'm assured they're on the verge of a major breakthrough.
Good. Just as long as we get a working weapon out of it by June. Right, general?
I wouldn't know, Dave. I haven't had a working weapon since Korea.
Right.  Larry, let's see the film on blinding techniques, then we'll have some lunch, all right?
It doesn't seem to be working; but if it was, these gases would be going around.
We don't care.
Hi, my name is Harry. Let me guess your weight and age...midget mutant; weight...
Are you Dr. Atherton?
Yes, dear.
I just love your television show.
Well, thank you. We try.
What's Albert Einstein really like?
Dead.
Oh, I thought you had him on.
No, that was just an actor.
Is everyone an actor, then?
 No, I'm a physicist.
But Einstein isn't?
 Nice talking to you.
See, Dad, it's coherent light.
It talks?
No.
Dr. ATHERTON, what a surprise.
Hello, Mrs. Simon. How are you?
No problem with Mitch's test scores or anything, is there?
No, no. I just thought I'd stop by, bring you the good news myself. I just got word from the admissions committee. We did it. Mitch is in.
Isn't that wonderful.
 Hello, Mitch.
 Hi.
Nice little display?
Thanks
What's your medium?
Just Argon. But I have it all structured for HF if I could get some.
That would be interesting.
It's all theoretical at this stage, but I have the power supply completely worked out.
Very nice.
 Thanks.
You must be very proud. he's the first student we've ever accepted for winter term entrance at Pacific Tech.
I image he's the youngest, too.
No, actually. The youngest we've had was a twelve, but he cracked under the pressure within six months so we don't really count him.
 Fifteen year old and off to college. Image.
Listen Doc. This scholarship thing, does he get any kind of whatya call it, signing bonus sort of thing?
 Well, no...but by allowing Mitch to progress at an accelerated rate we give him the opportunity to fulfill a far greater portion of his remarkable intellectual potential. Don't you agree?
Yeah, I guess. It's just that athletes get, you know, cars and stuff.
 Well, I guess we scientists are a little different than athletes.
Cheaper.
Smarter
Not when it comes to getting cars.
We just want the best for Mitchie.  Dr. Atherton, I saw your show the other night, about radioactive isotopes, and I have a question for you.
Oh, yes?
Is that your real hair?
Well, I wondered that, too.
 Well, interesting question, when you consider the philosophical aspects of whether anything on television is "real" or actually just an "image" being broadcast.
Didn't look real. Anyway, listen, I got to get something to eat or I'm gonna die.
Come on, let's look for something.
I saw over there one of the kids was doing an experiment with insect protein.
Did you see anyone doing anything with corned beef?
Your parents...
Yes?
They're...nice
They're Okay. They just sometimes don't have any idea of what I'm talking about.
I'm sure of that. Afraid you're going to miss your friends?
No. I don't have any. I think I intimidate other kids.
Good boy.
I don't want to.
Remember, compared to you, most people have the IQ of a carrot. We're different than most people, Mitch, but you should be proud of that. I mean, look around. From now on, you'll BE amongst peers, colleagues. I suppose I might as well tell you now, I've put you on my personal research team. Some of the finest minds on campus, not the least of which is, of course, my own.
It sounds great.
Well, now, I'm expecting great things from you, my boy. This is only the second time I've given this honor to a freshman. The first was...
Chris Kinsley.
You know Chris?
No, but he's a legend in the Physics Club.
Well, you're going to become a legend yourself. You'll be working with Chris. He's a senior now but he's still on the team and still as brilliant as ever.
Wow.
 Guys, I want you to meet Chris Kinsley. Chris, this is Sherry Nugil, my assistant, and Mike Dodd.
Dr. Dodd?
He's the man who just designed the new Telcom Satellite here.
I know. Nice to meet you Dr. Dodd. Isn't the Telcom raining debris all over Europe?
 That was a launch problem, not a design problem. Why are you wearing that toy on your head?
Oh, this. Sorry, I was worried that people would think I was stuffy, You know, no fun; all brain, no penis,
Pardon?
I'm sorry, it's just an infantile response to authority.
 Yes. you are Chris Kinsley, aren't you?
No. Well, yes. I mean, I used to be.  Now I'm Mhavishnue Kinsley.
 I see. You are being funny.
Well, I just can't help it. You're such a fun guy yourself.
Oh yes. I think you'll find we all are, right Mike?
No.
Now Chris, Sherry is going to show you around the place. She can answer any questions you might have about fringe benefits or dress codes or anything and I'll see you back upstairs when you're done, okay? Sherry, take good care of this young man. He's one of the ten finest minds kin the country.
Someday I hope to be two of them.
See you later.
You are very beautiful.
You don't act like one of the top ten minds in America.
Oh, really? How many of them have you met?
 Seven.
Really?
You'll be eight. Six was Professor Hostetler at M.I.T.
He is now.
And so, coupled with full insurance coverage and bonus plans, you find it adding up to a fairly sizable perks package.
I have a pretty sizable perks package right now.
Also, we understand that you people don't care too much for rigid timetables, and that's pretty rare in private industry.
So are you.
Is it true that school of yours keeps getting smarter and smarter kids every year?
Yup! I mean no!
You see the funding associations are the same. Our theoretical work is in the Blue Sky sector as well.
You have no idea how much I need that kind of continuity in my life right now.
You just belong here, Chris. We have several of Dr. Atherton's former students and they're all doing quite well with us.
What number was he?
Two. One of his other students was four.
You're wonderful.
I know.
Can we go somewhere?
Yes.
 Talk smart to me.
What?
Please I need it. What was your favorite course?
I guess right now I'd have to say Fluid Mechanics.
Oooooooooh...
 And Gym.
Please.
Sorry.
What's your research with Artherton?
Ultra-high power laser as an energy force for fusion. Tremendous boon to all mankind. And womankind, too.
Fusion, more fusion.
It's the process for obtaining enormous amounts of energy from forms of hydrogen, like Deuterium and Tritium.
Oh, my God, more.
Extracting the fuels is no problem.
Hmmmm.
Getting them to combine and release the energy is the problem.
Oohh, yes
It takes temperatures of 100 million degrees Celsius.
Oh, God.
So, I'm...
Yes.
...building...
Yes.
...a laser...
Oh, yes.
...that pulses...
Hmmmmmmmm.
...very hot...
Ohhh...
...and causes...
Yes.
...Fusion...
Ahhhhhhhhhhh.
Good afternoon. I'm looking for  the President's Freshman Tea.
 Oh, good. I'm so glad we have one then. Who are you?
Mitch Simon.
Oh yes. You're the special case. I know Gene wants to meet you. You're just in time for his traditional talk. Would you like a glass of sherry?
I'm a minor.
Aha, well of course you are. That would explain your height.
People, if I might get your attention.
Welcome back, freshmen! I take it you all put the Christmas break to good use?
Now, if you'll indulge me, I'd like to speak seriously for a moment. You will recall that when I welcomed you to the Pacific institute of Technology a few short months ago I spoke of how we are one of the finest scientific institutions in the world. I think the finest. I mentioned our six Nobel Prize winners, our members of the national Academy of Sciences, and our members of the National Academy of Engineering.  This is an intellectual oasis of technological achievement in the dessert of general academic mediocrity we see inmost colleges and universities today.
I also spoke of the fact that you are the finest freshmen class we have ever had here.
I say this to every freshman class. Each year we raise our entrance requirements and each year there is a group of students like you who meet and surpass those requirements.
As you have no doubt already noticed by now, over a third of you are gone. By the end of the year another third of you will have followed them out of Eden and into mediocrity.
We want only the best. Hard work and high standards are expected of everyone. And if you aren't up to it Cal tech or M.I.T. might take you, but you don't fit in here.
Let me remind you that this place is an opportunity, not a right; a chance not a gift; a working lunch, not a picnic. Welcome back. Several waitresses begin serving tea but the despair of reality creeps over the students and they begin to disperse. Mitch stands waiting for the approaching Dr. Meredith.
Gene, this is Mitch Simon.
Oh, yes, Professor Artherton's bright star.
Yes, sir.
And I understand you're already on his project. I'm assured you're going to do great things.
I hope so.
Let me give you some advice.
Thank you.
Don't screw up.
Okay. I guess I better go now.
 I think the young people really appreciate my " getting down" verbally, don't you?
Absolutely.
Hey!
Yes?
Come in here.
Just leave the sandwiches and go.
Me?
No, Yoda; yeah, you.
I don't have any ah...
Brains?
No, sandwiches.
Well then, what good are you?
What are we supposed to eat?
 How about my shorts.
Hey! Who do you think you're talking to?
Are you from the restaurant or not?
No. I'm Mitch Simon. I'm a student. Dr. Atherton told me to come up here.
Oh, you're the new stud, are you. Or is it dud?
How do you mean?
Stud. Hot shot. Brain. You're the twelve-year-old, right?
I'm fifteen.
Does your body know that?
Are you expecting him or...
Sure. Can I get you something? A balloon?
Are any of you guys Chris Kinsley?
No, Thank God.
Hey Kent, I hear Kinsley got that PEI job all locked up.
Damn! I wanted that job.
Why?
Why? Because it starts at fifty thousand a year, that's why. Plus travel, car, stock options...
Oh. Well, I'm supposed to have a look at your work up to date. Check it over.
Check it over.
Yes.
For what?
Mistakes, I guess. He said you guys are stuck.
Let's get something very clear here. Everything you've heard about the supportive student body and the honor code might hold for the rest of the campus, but it doesn't count for squat in here. Which means when jerry's not here, you do what I say. From God to Jerry to me, get it?
Hi Jerry.
I've told you before, Kent, you don't get to use my first name.
Did I?
 Good to see you, Mitch.
 I'm sure you're all going to become fast friends.
We're well on our way already.
Good, because after Mitch is brought up to date, I want the rest of you to take your cues from him. He'll be in charge of the group.
What? I mean, good choice, Jerry.
You're doing it again, Kent.
Am I?
Where's Chris?
He didn't bother to come in today.
He said he didn't feel like it; and then I said 'you better'; and then he said ' or what?'; and then I said ' or he'd get the heck,' and then he said 'jam it, it's Sunday' and he looks for God on Sundays; so I said 'okay, but I'm telling.'
Thank you Bodie. I notice you've stopped stuttering.
Yes, I've been giving myself some sock treatment and it's working.
Good.  I'm sorry he isn't here. I wanted you to meet your hero.
Hero? That clown? Look at this.
We heard he wasn't coming in. Kent and I figured we'd go ahead and run his section without him. And we started getting picosecond ratings that aren't even in the ballpark.
It looks like it'll take at least a week to re-do all this and start again.
Another costly mistake.
Are you sure?
Positive.
Positive.
 Negative.  There's a mistake all right, but I think you guys made it. Look, you inverted the last two steps.
 I don't make mistakes...  ...Usually.
Damnit, don't touch other people's things.
 This shouldn't take too long to fix.
I'm glad that you were here, Mitch.
Yes, thanks for pointing out Carter's mistake, Mitch.
Don't bother with that now. I'm sure you want to go get settled.
 Well, it has been kind of a long day.
Oh, I forgot Kent, I need your help.
Anything, Jerry.
Stop it.
What?
Get copies made of everything so young Mitch here can get started  checking everything tomorrow.
My pleasure.
And then, on your way back, stop at my cleaners.
Don't give it a thought. I enjoy it.
 Shall we?
Sure.
I guess it goes from God to Jerry to you to the cleaners, right Kent?
Hello?
Hello?
What kind of place is this?
Hi.
Hey, you just gonna sit there admiring the room or are you going to help me with this?
What is this thing?
It's a penis stretcher. You want to try it out?
No!
Oh really? Well, congratulations, then, No, It's an Iron Mike.
What?
A baseball pitching machine.
I was here for a second this morning...
 You didn't straighten the place up, did you?
 No.
Good. 'Cause all my filth's in alphabetical order.
Anyway, I dropped off my luggage and now all my bags are empty.
I put your stuff away for you.
It's all in the bottom drawer. Shirts, pants, underwear, shoes. I had a little trouble with your sport jacket, so I threw it out. Nah, only kidding. This one's for you, little Johnny.
What a game. I'm Chris Kinsley.
Oh, no.
We're falling way behind, Jer.
Well, we're not making cheese sandwiches here, you know, Don.
That's a good one. I'll have to remember to use that, Jer.
The new boy is quick.
He better be because the company needs a practical working model within four months.
You can't dictate innovation.
Let me put this another way, Jer. You  know all that money we've been spending for development?
Yes
Well, when a project gets cut off, the finance boys always run an audit.
I see.
 Having a little work done on the old place, are you? Looks nice.
Library... library...205.
Welcome to Pacific Tech's "Smart People On Ice."
 Ice turned out real good, Ick.
Yeah, it worked., didn't it?
What did you use?
 Oh, sure, I tell you then you tell somebody else, and the next thing you know we're in the middle of another ice age.
 Come on, people. Nobody's skating.
Just 'cause you're a slack, Kinsley.
Moles and trolls.
What?
Moles and trolls. Work, work, work, work. I plan this for weeks. I go to a lot of trouble and all they want to do is study. I'm hurt. I know that's it's not like me but I'm sorry. I'm starting to get discouraged, people. We had nobody at the mutant hamster races, one entry in the Madame Curie look-alike contest, and he was disqualified later. Why do I even bother?
 How does he do it?
Well, I'm not an expert, but I think he puts one foot in front of the other and pushes.
Not skating. The horsing around. The never studying. I know he's smart. but nobody's that smart.
I don't know how smart he is. Before he even came here he invented a solar battery, which laid the groundwork for the system that provides the energy for Amarillo, at half the cost. He'd be a millionaire today if he been smart enough to make them pay for it. How he pulls the grades, I don't know.
You okay?
No, not emotionally, no I'm not. I'm disappointed... not terribly, but still, it should have gone much, further, much faster. It's okay, though, I know what the problem is, that's simple, it's obviously the drag coefficient, I'll just have to re-design the blades. I can do that, that's easy. I can do that here; but I have to cut then after they're designed, that takes tools, that takes time. How long is this stuff going to last, do you know?
Maybe another half an hour.
That's great, that's good. I can do that, no problem, lots of time.  What's your name?
Mitch
Thanks for the help. See you.
Your welcome.  Who was that?
That? that was...
 I'm Jordan, I realized I'd forgotten to tell you my name, it's Jordan. I heard there was going to be someone new this term, are you a freshman?
Yes.
Do you have a bed?
Yeah.
Oh, I was going to make you one if you needed it but you don't so that's okay. Well, I gotta go, I'll see you later, probably. See you Ick, see you Mitch.
What's all this suppose to be?
This? This is new kind of shovel.
 This should keep you busy for awhile. This, plus your regular class load should turn your brains to mush in a month.
Aw! Kent, we were going to name you King of the Winter Carnival.
Ha ha.  I suppose you're in on this, too. Did you make this stuff?
I'm not saying.
Who's going to clean it up?
Don't have to. It's going to go from solid form directly to gas.
 Really? What is it?
I'm not saying. But I can tell you that it's fairly rare, and very unstable.
You're all a bunch of degenerates.
We are? What about that time I caught you naked with a bowl of Jello?
 I...you... I was hot and I was hungry. And anyway...Look, Kinsley, you're not number one anymore.
Number one what?
 Mighty mouse, here, beat your placement scores by over twenty points.
Really? I guess you think you're pretty hot stuff?
 Well...no, I mean
Hey! Maybe you are smarter than me, but, can you do this?
 It worked!
That's neat.
 Now if we can just keep it from exploding.
 Hey, Ick.  Is it okay to breathe this stuff?  Ick?  Ick?
Hello?
Hi, good morning, I thought I saw you come in here, you must be an earlier riser, we met last night, I'm Jordan, remember? I had a sled with me, I made you a sweater.
Last night?
yeah, it's just something I do with my hands while I'm reading. I hope I got the size right, I'm pretty sure I did, I have a brother so I use him as a sizing comparison, and I have a pretty good eye for that sort of thing, so I just went ahead and made you one because I was, you know, up. Peeing?
Yeah.
I never sleep. I don't know why. It drove my roommate nuts. I mean really nuts, they had to take her away in an ambulance and everything, she's okay now thought but she had to be transfer to an easier school but I don't know if that part has anything to do with being my fault, but still, anyway, if you ever want any help studying at night or just let me know, okay, 'cause I'm just a couple of doors down from you guys and I'm usually up and I wouldn't mind, okay?
Thanks, I will.
Are you finished yet?
I can't start.
Because I'm here?
I think so.
Isn't that weird? Well, I have to go.
Me, too.
Right, well, don't forget what I said, I'll put the sweater in your room, see you later, tell Chris that if he wants one I'll be happy to make him one but nit today because after classes I'm going to rebuild the back part of my room, you should come down and see it later, I have to go, bye.
 bye.
Something strange happened to me this morning.
Was it a dream where you see yourself dressed up in kind of sun god robes standing on top of a pyramid with all theses nude women throwing little pickles at you?
No
Why am I the only person who has that dream?
Liquid nitrogen?
Coffee?
So, what's happened?
Oh. There's a guy living in our closet.
You've seen him too?
Who is it?
Hopsfield.
Is he... safe?
So far.
A quick series of shots moves us through the next two months of time, accompanied by an original song.
 It's nothing. It's just mechanical.
GOOD. Don't bother changing it. I want you and Bodie to rebuild the whole unit; same output in half the size. Should hold up, right Mitch?
Sure, as long as we go with H.F.
Well, gentlemen, now what? Things are going okay so far, aren't they?
They certainly are in my area, Jerry.
 KENT
 Yes?
Boy, when I think of all the applications for this...!
 We've got enough theory to deal with without talking applications. You just worry about giving me that power breakthrough. how close are you?
 Not very, from what I hear.
 Aren't you and Chris working together?
Yes...but...
Where is Mr. Kinsley?
 He's outside.
 Kinsley! Dr. Atherton wants you.
Coming.
What are you doing out there?
Floating, sir.  And thinking.
 I want to see you at my house at six o'clock. Sharp.
Sounds fun. Should I bring anything?
How about a proper attitude for a change?
I'll try and borrow one. Now, if you'll excuse me, there are millions of boys and girls everywhere waiting for me to bring them presents. Ho ho ho.
He's really pushing it, isn't he, Jerry?
You wanted to see me, your joggingness?
Mr. Kinsley. Right on time. What a surprise. Do you run?
Only when chased.
What are you eating?
It's one of mark's Ickagami's experiments. He's been irradiating corn with strontium. it's his hobby; big food.
That's popcorn?
It's big popcorn.
 Get it away from me. I can't stand it. I hate popcorn. Leave it there. Chris puts the bag down on the porch.
Okay. Have you ever considered switching to de-caffeinated coffee?
I want to start seeing a lot more of you in the lab.
You want me to work nude?
Very funny, you're a major disappointment to me, Chris.
And you to me, Jerry.
 We had a deal!
And I advanced your project more than any three guys on campus.
That was yesterday. What have you done for me today?
Hey, aren't you getting a little obsessive about this? I took in the new kid. He's working his guts out for you.
Your arrogant, disrespectful behavior is distracting him. If you keep it up, you're going to pay for it.
Hey, I'm out of here. Delenda Est Cartheo. P.E.I. July one.
You still have to pass, dear boy, and considering the fact that my class is a requisite, it would seem that I would have some control over your destiny. From now on, you and Mr. Simon are going to spend every waking moment working on my power problem and you will solve it by my deadline.
Okay, Jerry, but I really think you should see an analyst.
Hi. Do me a favor, taste this.
Come on, you won't hurt my feelings.
I...
Well, too sweet?
What is it?
Beats me. I just found it in one of the labs.
Aggghh!!
Come on. I'm just pulling your leg. How are you doing?
I'm stuck. Dr. Atherton says we've got to miniaturize the power supply and you're not helping.
Lighten up. It's only a laser.
Instead of trying to take that roomful of capacitors over there and putting new perspective. Charge this baby up. Everything you've got.
What for?
You'll see. Go
All set, I think.
Do it.
A roomful of capacitors loading.
What are you doing now?
Making hamburgers.
Oh, no!
Relax, it's just the fuses at the sub station. They'll have it back on in a second. More importantly, did we get a charge?
Wow!
Follow the yellow brick road.
Have you ever considered the fact that you are completely wasting your life?
Constantly.
 Aloha.
Come on in, boys. Surf's up.
 I have a geochemistry test tomorrow and I do not feel adequately prepared.
But the main thing is you look good.
Thanks.
What if we end up having too much fun and end up failing?
And would that be the end of the world. Milton?
Yes, it would.
Yeah, you're right. Maybe you should go back to the library.
Well, maybe I could just look for a minute.
 Are those girls?
I haven't had them all tested yet, Cornell, but so far so good.
Who are they?
They're not from here. I'd know.
No, no they're not, they're from a nearby college though.
Which one?
The Wanda Trossler School of beauty.
They're beauticians?
Not yet.
Gee, I don't know...
They'll teach you. Let's get serious here, lads. There are 670 guys at pacific tech and 136 girls.
A ratio of 4.93 to 1
Good, Milton. Of the 136 girls, most of them can find guys a lot better than you.
Oh, easily.
These girls are not used to geniuses. You might impress them.
I don't see how.
Let me put this another way. Given the type of people you are and the environment you're in, you guys have to admit the strong probability that this may be the only chance you'll ever get in your entire lives to have sex.
Think about it.
So, what do you guys do? Just be smart all the time?
Well...
What's your major?
Astrophysics.
Is that like sports medicine?
Space.
 Oh! Let me ask you something about that. If I was on the moon, Could I like tease hair much higher?
Theoretically.
This is fascinating.
My friend Evelyn, tells me that brilliant men are the best lovers.
I'd say that's true.
Up to now, what's been your ultimate sexual experience?
I once fell off a ladder and landed on my sister, Bernice.
Why do you wear those glasses?
So I can see.
But you look very sexy without them.
I really should be studying.
Me too. I have a bleaching final tomorrow.
 Achew.
Bless you.
I'm allergic to suntan oil.
Maybe you should stop.
 I don't think I can
 You know, I read in the Enquirer that woman paid twenty thousand dollars for the sperm of a genius.
Really?
 I've GOT TWENTY BUCKS?
Do you have a cup?
 Hi.
Hi.
I was watching you...swim.
Yes?
I was thinking of maybe going for a swim myself.
Yeah? Is this the kiddy pool?
Don't eat that!
Huh?
Don't you know eating that stuff can give you very large breasts?  Oh. My god! I see I'm too late.
Christ, Don. I'm doing the best I can.  You act like I don't want my own invention to work. There are only so many hours in a day.
I agree. And what's more important, massaging your ego on television explaining the digestive system of a rabbit to the great unwashed or "project crossbow"
Off-hand, I'd say television.
 Just get rid of the crows' feet!  There's nothing more important than " crossbow," but when went from blue sky to black you turned into Bigfoot.
Ready to go, Dr. Atherton.
Pushing me doesn't help. You tell them that.
 Son of a bitch.
 Asshole.
I have something to...
 Did you pick up my dry cleaning?
Yes I did... there's something you should know.
The gravy stain?
No, that came out.  Chris and Mitch aren't working. They're at a party.
I want to show me where, right after I'm finished here.
 My pleasure.
In five...four...
...three...two...and...
WELCOME TO "SCIENCE," WITH YOUR HOST, Dr. JEROME ATHERTON. FUNDED BY...
... A grant from Pacific Electric Instruments. PEI. And now, Dr. Atherton.
Good evening. Tonight we're going to look at something most of us take for granted... the colon. What's it look like?
Wanna play?
I'm not very...
Sure, all right.
Some party, huh?
I guess.  How come you're not...
Necking?
well...
I'm not gay.
 I didn't... I wouldn't even...
Look, I'm seventeen. I'm brilliant, and I'm hyper kinetic. Guy are a little afraid of me, you know. It'll pass...I hope.
 I think you're very nice.
 Simon!
You were supposed to be in the lab tonight.
 Weren't you!
I was and...
You are at Pacific Tech to work, not to behave like a philistine.
That's right!
I was working, I...
Where's Kinsley. I imagine this was his idea.
No doubt!
 Kent!
 yes?
 I took a big chance recommending a fifteen-year-old. I guess I made a mistake. I hope you're proud of yourself.
Dr. Atherton?
What!
Are you wearing makeup?
Is it too try and hide those crows' feet?
 Gee, he looks depressed.
I'd like to make a collect call to Mrs. Bill Simon.
I know, but I don't like it here anymore. I want to live at home with you...  Yeah, and dad. I want to go back to high school. I-dad did what? Rented out my room? ...Well, why can't Mr. Echevarria and I share it?... Please, ma, I want to come home.
 Please let me come home. I don't want to stay here.
Kent...let's never fight like that again.
What?
We've been lovers too long to have a silly argument come between us.
Chris...
Please. Don't speak. You were right. Tonight I'll wear the cowboy suit.
 You...
Do your parents know about this?
Of course not!
Nobody knows. I mean, there's nothing to know.
Chris walks over to Mitch.
Where were you all last night?
The lab. Where you were supposed to be.
Jordan told me about Atherton coming down on you...what exactly did...
 ...Let me hold that thought and get back to ya.
Ken, Bodie and Carter. The gentle strains of classical music fill the room.
Something soothing to eat by.
Everyone stops eating and listens to Mitch begging his mother to come home. They share his embarrassment and lower their heads. Even Kent's friends are uncomfortable. Kent, on the other hand, is laughing it up, having a great time.
 Here comes the crying!
 Too low.
Okay, if you want to leave, go ahead. But you'll miss the fun.
 What fun?
Ick invented a new virus and we're gonna release it in Kent's room.
That's sick! That's a sick thing to do!
Hey, I was just kidding, I...
You're always just kidding. There's something wrong with you.
Just a second...
The other night I needed your help and all you wanted to do was party.
I tried to help you. I tried to help you relax.
Being snubbed by beauticians isn't my idea of relaxing.
Student beauticians.
 I thought this place was going to be different, but it's just the same. I'm either used or made fun of. In high school they pushed me in a mailbox, did I tell you that?
They called me Chris the whiss'...
Really? What's a whiss?
I think they meant wuss, but it didn't rhyme...when I was three years old, I balanced my father's checkbook so they sent me to school and fired their accountant. My father was so intimidated, he stopped speaking to me. My teacher disliked me because I was smarter than they were, and my classmates hated me because I bell the bell curve. Sound familiar? And tell me why my...why did my mother dress me in white shirts, hush puppies and a briefcase, guaranteeing that a girl would never talk to me?
YOU?
 And then one night, in this room, I was sitting right where you are sitting now. I had a vision. I saw him.
god
Hopsfield.
Hopsfield? Oh! The guy in the closet.
Yeah. Laslo Hopsfield. I followed him. Through the closet; down into the steam tunnels. And down there I saw the most disgusting thing Ive ever seen.
 What?
Hopsfield in his pajamas.
 And I talk to the guy . Turned out that in the Seventies he was the number one stud around here. Smarter than you and me put together. So brilliant, so sharp, so advanced, so long.
What do you mean?
He graduated. Went to work for some chemical company. One day someone told him he was making stuff that was killing people. I think it was his mother. He freaked. You see, he was totally unprepared for the real world. He had no philosophy. He thought science was the answer for everything.
Am I gonna wind up in a steam tunnel?
Yes, you are, Metaphorically speaking. Unless you see that the same thing that has made your life miserable can make it great; your brain. When you're smart, people need you, and you can learn how to work that for fun and profit.
You had a arrangement going with Atherton, don't you? That's why you don't have to study.
Hey, I don't carry a briefcase.  You're a nice kid. If you leave I'll miss you.
 If I stay, what should I do, I mean...
Well, the first thing you have to do is get even with Kent. It's a moral imperative.
 Yeah.
And at Northern Electronics you get the stock options, but not the free housing, It's what makes PEI so sweet. You get everything.
Yeah, and Kinsley's got that locked.
 Maybe he does, and maybe he doesn't. They walk away.
Over here!
He puts his name on his car. He does the same thing with his underwear.
Chris, Mitch, Jordan and Ick working on Kent's car. They are undoing bolts, talking out wires, removing fenders, etc. The last DISSOLVE and we see the car is gone. And no sign of our foursome.
Chris and Mitch enter.
Hey, Kent. That's your car.
You're not supposed to park on campus.
This isn't funny. You went too far this time, Kinsley.
I had help.
 You?  I'm going to get you guys. Dr. Atherton's gonna hear about this.
 Hey, Kent, you owe us ten dollars for the gas.  He'll never pay us.
Wow! Hello.
Hi.
Jerry asked me to drop by. What did he ask you to do?
What?
Which word didn't you understand?
Are you here for the meeting?
What meeting?
I don't know.
Okay.
I'm just waiting.
Right.
 And finally, it comes down to, if you can't do it, we'll get somebody else. I have a timetable, doctor.
We're very close, Dave, don't worry, everything's going to be fine.
 Don, try and remember you work for me.  I think I've made my point, haven't I?
 Crystal clear, Mr. Decker.
Good.
Anything I should know about?
Shut up Kinsley. I'll be with you in a moment.
Goodbye, Jerry, and good luck. Susan?
I guess this is goodbye. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to know you. At all.  Have you ever seen breasts like theses before?
She happens to be my daughter.
Oh, then I guess you have.
 I'll be reporting to him every day.
Coming, Don?
Yes, Sir.
What do you think you're doing?
You said come over.
Take off those shoes.
Stay off the rugs.
What's up, Doc.
I'm withdrawing your recommendation to PEI.
What?
I'm giving Kent the job.
Did you suddenly find humor?
You haven't solved my power problem.
I'm trying.
No, you're not. So, I'm going to fail you, so you won't graduate, so you can't take the job. Q.E.D.
I'll pass your exam.
We had a deal!
Did we? That doesn't sound very ethical.
You can't do this. I'll go to Dr. Meredith.
 Go ahead. What are you going to tell him. Don't forget, like most scientists, he is an honorable, moral man who thinks everyone else is too. I'll just deny anything you say.
You dick!
Count on it.
What are you doing?
Self-realization. I was thinking of jumping, but it's only twelve feet.
Something wrong?
No. Atherton is going to flunk me out of school.
But you had a deal.
Yeah, and he says I didn't deliver. You sleep with pits, you wake up smelly. I think Aristotle said that. It was him or Eva Gabor. At least Hopsfield still has his integrity.
Excuse me?
I thought I was so smart. I didn't want to be like the other dumb geniuses like Hopsfield. I though I could use Them., instead of Them using me. But, Guess what?
I have to agree. It does appear that you've been the victim of your own erroneous logic.
Thank you.
However, this doesn't mean that you can't get yourself out.
How?
Hard work?
But that's the old way.
A series of shots showing Chris hard at work, underscored by an original song.
 Please, Vito, not in the mailbox again.
Mitch!
Oh... I was just reliving some high school highlights.
Look, you don't have to stay up with me. It's not like we're driving. Get some sleep. You're a growing boy. I hope.
Hi, Laslo.
I thought you might want some help so I dug into the computer and got every question Artherton's ever asked on every final he ever given.
Gee, I didn't get you anything. Is that them?
No, these are entries for McDonald's Sweepstakes. No purchase necessary. Enter as often as you want. So, I am.
Really?
This box makes it one million, six hundred thousand. I should win thirty two point six percent of the prizes, including the car.
Kind of takes the fun out of it, doesn't it?
I suppose so. But they set up the rules, and lately, I have come to realize that I have certain materialistic needs.
So where are the questions?
 I memorized them.
I have to go to sleep now.
Want my pajamas?
Uhhh...thanks, no.
Smart kid. He's going to grow five inches in the next year.
How do you...never mind.
Mitch?
 Jordan?
Mitch Simon?
Who?
I'm Sherry Nugil. And I've been waiting three years for this.
For what?
For you to be old enough.
For what?
For this.
Are you ready?
For what?
Why do you keep saying, 'For what?'
'Cause so far it's working great.
 Come in.
Oh, hi, Mitch. I'm just sanding the floor.
Could you turn that off a second?
What's wrong? Why are you sweating?
I...I just...I came back from helping Chris and there was this woman in my room.
A woman?
 A woman. I mean she was...blessed
Oh?
And she wanted to...How can I say this so as not to offend you?
Jump you?
Yeah. I hope you're not offended.
So what happened?
 She kissed me. Then she took off her clothes. Then I took off my clothes-she had to help me. I kept blacking out - then... it was unbelievable.
You made it with her?
No. That's what was unbelievable.
Sure.
It's true. I stopped her and told her I didn't want to.
Afraid?
No...I mean I really did want to ... but not with her.
Let's go girls
What's that supposed to mean?
It's just a f..f..figure of speech, Bodie. You guys coming to the exam or not?
 I guess we should, seeing as he's gone to all the bother of having one and everything.
You guys go ahead. I have to go to the bathroom.
 Okay, Kent, but I don't think that's going to help your confidence, do you?
 So, Mr. Funny Man, let's see how funny you think this is.
You will have exactly three hours. And remember, we believe in the honor system here, people.
Good luck, buddy boy.
Is it okay if I name my first child after you? Dipshit Kinsley has a nice ring to it.
 This is my class hour!
 We're past the deadline. Don't you understand, Decker's dangerous. We need those plans.
 It's not ready yet. But it will be. I've got Kinsley cooking now. He'll do it. Believe me, I know how to push that kid's buttons.  Here are my drawings for the optics in the sighting system.
 Decker wants the laser by the end of the week.
 I'm doing all I can, damnit!
The piece of paper. It says, "I aced this."
A piece of paper which reads, "Ace the laser."
 Okie-dokie, doc, a house doesn't have to fall on ole Chris Kinsley.
 No!!!!
You bastard. This is your  fault.
Shit! I deserve that. It all comes back on you in the end.
Holy shit!
 Of course, it's so simple. Echoes, bouncing back at me and you.
Mitch?!
Laslo! Buddy! Have you seen Mitch?
No. How did you do?
 I failed!
You shouldn't have.
That's true. But never mind that now. It came to me. The power problem. I solved it. Echoes! It's so simple, four little mirrors. It bounces back and supercharges the gas itself. I've got to find Mitch to help me build it but it should increase the power ten-fold at least. If you see him, tell him to meet me at the lab. Bye.
Oh, Chris. How did it go?
Great. It was a snap. But Atherton said he's failing me anyway.
That's terrible. You must be feeling awful. Are you all right?
Thank you, Jordan. I do feel terrible but I can't talk about it right now. I need Mitch. Gotta go. Bye.
He seems to be handling it all right.
 Hiya, Jerry, how's it going?
What do you want Kinsley?
World peace, but I don't think this is the time to discuss it.
What are you doing here? I've already told you you've burned out and you've failed me and yourself miserably.
Yes, I know that. But I thought you might be interested.
I'm not interested in anything you have to say.
Jerry?
I solved the power problem, Jerry.
Debbie, go home.
As you know, I was working on supercharging the DF by means of a fusion technique using a secondary laser. Well, when I tried it, I discovered Kent had sabotaged it so it collapsed on itself.
And I want to thank him for the thought.
What????
The Deuterium and Fluorine take up enough space by themselves, right? Well, the mistake we've been making up to now is in trying to kick up the power by means of yet another outside source. Big and bulky, right? Well, the elegance of this is that by reflecting part of the lasing light back in the gas jets we supercharge the whole deal, increasing the power tenfold with no increase in size.
This is a complete waste of time.
Kent, make yourself useful for once and help put those plates against the wall.
Okay, Mitch do it. This should work.
Now we open the vacuum chamber.
So far so good. And now, cross your fingers.
Sorry about the wall, sir.
 And the tree across the quad.
 Screw the wall, you did it! You really did it.
 I've done my part, too.
 Okay, Kinsley. You did it. You pass.
Thank you, sir.
And I think we can get that job back for you at PEI.
 What! You can't. That's my job. I've done everything you've ever asked. I get your laundry, and I finished the mirror. Look.
See! Do you have any idea how hard it is to make a film virtually 100 per cent reflective, one micron thick and apply it to a mirror this shape?
Good, Kent.  I have to go. I have a pressing...
 Let's celebrate.
Absolutely. Kent, you with us?
 Oh...eat me.
I don't think I'm ready for that yet. Maybe we should wait a year; at least until I get my license.
I understand. There are a lot of things to be considered here. For example, I could drive.
 I've been thinking about your laser solution.  I figure you've increased the output to six megawatts.
Yeah.
What would you use that for?
The applications are unlimited. Industrial for one.
With the gas tanks you've designed the beam would only last for forty seconds. What good is that?
I don't care, Laslo. I graduated.
Let the engineers figure out a use for it. That's not our concern.
Maybe somebody already has a use for it, one for which it's perfectly designed.
You mean Atherton had something in mind all along?
Looks at the facts: very high power, portable, limited firing time, unlimited range. All you'd need is a big spinning mirror and you could vaporize a human target from space.
This is not good.
You want another beer?
How big a mirror?
The mirror is gone, too. Atherton, you worm! You pig! You fuck! Kent, you too!
I should have seen it! How could I have not seen it!
He lied to us.
It's easy to lie to you. You trust people! I'm cynic! What an asshole I am!
I understand how you feel, Chris, and you're right. But what we should be doing now is trying to find out what he's doing.
Did you do it?
I put a receiver in it too.  Is he okay?
I don't know he stopped talking about an hour ago. May I see it?
Ready?
We'll have two minutes.
Hi, guys.
 Open his mouth.
It was his braces that gave me the idea. They're a perfect antenna. His whole..
It's about time someone put it to good use.
 Kent. Kent. Wake up, Kent.
I'm talking to you, Kent.
What?
I said I'm talking to you.
 No!
Yes.
 I'm not asleep. I must be overworked.
You're not overworked, Kent.
Well, I'm not insane!
Am I?
That remains to be seen, Kent. But we are having a conversation.
I have to metabolize this. Um... who is this?
This is Jesus, Kent, and you've been a very naughty boy.
 All right! Who is this?! Bodie? Carter?
I am known by many names. I am the One. Turn to me and be saved.
Oh, Sure.
Cut the crap, Kent, you've built a weapon.
How did you know that?
I know everything.
Oh. God.
That's right, Kent. Where is the laser now?
I can't tell you.
How would you like to burn for the rest of time?
 No, they're testing it on the twenty-seventh but I don't know where. It's classified.
Oh.
What?
Nothing. I want you to think about what you've done and repent, and from now on, stop playing with yourself.
I don't...okay
Now what?
Phase two.
This is the phone terminal for the entire school.
Okay, we tap Atherton's office phone. What about his home?
All the faculty's home phone are part of the University system.
 Great, all we have to do is find it!
We'll find it.
I'm depressed. Why did I listen to my parents? I should have become a ping-pong pro.
It's not too late.
You shouldn't be depressed. It's us he used.
Downtown Schmidlap.
Excuse me?
 Ernie "Downtown" Schmidlap. From my high school. He was captain of everything. One day he told me he wanted to "date me up." so for a month he'd come over and I'd do his homework for him. He was going to take me to the prom. But once he passed his courses, he took Roberta Preen. I stayed home and re-wired our housekeeper's TV.
That's awful!
You think that hurts?  You should've met my Uncle Stan. He was a Weasel.
That bad, huh?
No, that was his lodge. The Royal order of Friendly Weasels.  Every Wednesday when I was eight, he'd take me down to his lodge meeting and he'd challenge people to call out two five-digit numbers. I had to multiply them in my head faster than a guy could do it on a calculator. They'd bet on me. Of course, after the meeting, he'd take me for ice cream.
That's nice.
Well...he'd take me to the supermarket and I had to dip my hand in.
I've got his office.
I've got his home.
Why doesn't your phone ring, you jogging, syphilitic microbe?
 I think he's coming around.
Hello
Is this Jerome Atherton?
Yes, it is.
This is Bill Carlisle. I saw your television show the other night about the reproductive system.
Thank you, I hope you enjoyed it.
I love it. Everything you said was copied word for word from my book and I expect a lot of money for it.
Need I remind you, it's public television, an attempt to teach people something. And all you can think of is personal greed. It's people like you that make me feel bad about being American.
I'm Canadian
I'm not surprised. Good day.
God, he's good at that. He almost gets away with it. That's the most manipulative guy I've ever seen... I mean heard.
He does get away with it.
Not anymore.
Jordan?
Hmmmmmmmm.
You were sleeping.
I was? Gee  I guess you relax me.
 Wow!
 What's going on?
I put Jordan to sleep.
And you're proud of that?
Yeah.
 Yes...hello
Jer? Dave Decker How are you?
Christ, Dave what time is it?
Nine thirty here in Washington. I thought you Californians all get up early and exercise. Ha, ha
This is it. That's the guy I saw at his house with the daughter.
Very funny, Dave. What do you want?  I'm busy.
It sounds like it. Listen, I'll be out there tomorrow for the test but I want you to go to the Marsh this afternoon and check optics systems one more time.
Why?
Because I'm in charge, Doctor. Goodbye. He hangs up. All look to Chris.
Well?
 It's happening.
It's only weapon if it works, right?
 You're absolutely right! The time has come, people. No more being used. No more Downtown Schmidlaps or Uncle Stans or Jerry Athertons. We're going to take responsibility for our own brains. Remember, without ethics there can be no morality. Without morality there is no society and without society there can be no fast food restaurants. So the whole country, nay, in the world, is counting on us to get even in a big way. Thank you.
Nice logic.
Thanks. Synchronize watches.
Why?
It's just something you say at a time like this.
I don't need a watch.
Okay, forget it. Let's go.
Atherton's car is passing through a high security gate into Marsh field.
Boy, these secret fields are so untrusting.
So we can't get on-base clearance.
I guess not.
Forget it. We'll balls it.
How do these look?
Two fake I. D.'s with Mitch's and Chris's picture on them. Perfect. I hope.
What if they don't fool anybody?
They shoot us.
Are you all right?
What? Oh, yes, fine. Have you ever had a feeling that there's something terribly wrong?
No.
All clear, Mr. Decker. Just follow the yellow line. Chris accidentally hits the horn. Through the windshield we SEE Decker and the guard look back. Chris recognizes Decker.
 How long does it take?
I.D.
Snap it up, will ya? We just flew in. We're tired. We're hungry. We have this stupid car.
Are you out of your mind?
You have to intimidate these guys.
You're not on the list.
Of course not. We're classified.
I don't know what he should look for, just tell him if he sees anything out of the...let me tell him.
Aren't you guys a little young to be technicians?
Lasers are a young science. There, fine, now you've made me say it. Now we're all in trouble.
Look, I'll call the duty officer.
 Excuse me.
Look, pal, don't call anybody.  We're four hours late. It's our jobs.   Give us a break, will ya?  Someday you might be in the private sector, right?
We're supposed to look for anything out of the ordinary.
Okay.
Nice work. Keep it up.
What?!
We've got a connection.  They're in.
Get the EEPROMs.
 Abbott to Costello.
 This is Costello. Go ahead, Abbott.
 Costello,  who's on first?
We've got the goodies.
We have the target coordinates computed for trajectory adjustment.
Great. Shoot.
Oh, oh.
What?
Oh, nothing.
The plane will reach an altitude of sixty-five thousand feet.  When it is over, the target will fire the laser from here ....  ... for five point two seconds.
They're all set for the final onboard check.
Fine.  Right this way, gentlemen.
I think I've found it.  May I have the coordinates, please.
 Thirty-four degrees, ten minutes, fifteen seconds North; one hundred eighteen degrees, nine minutes, three seconds West.
 We're sending.
 We're taking.
Atherton and his group come around the corner of a building and head for the plane.
They're coming this way.
 You may be interested in knowing that Mitch reports that Herr Professor is approaching and I'm not even sweating.  Isn't that remarkable?
Please hurry.  Atherton's coming.
 Please, I don't work well under pressure.
There. I hope that does it.
 Okay, Chris  ... I mean Abbott.  Hello ... hello ... hello ...
Everything all right?
Of course.
 Oh, I forgot ...
A glimpse of Chris and Mitch as they disappear around the corner of the building.
What is it?
Nothing.
Hi, Kent.
 Oh, I thought you were gone.
Not yet.  Have you been touching yourself?
Yes. I mean, no.
 Good, Kent.  Dad, my father, you know, God, wants to show you something.
Why?  I mean, what?
I've learned not to ask.
He wants you to wait on the sidewalk at six thirty nine Ivy Crest Drive at precisely six-oh-eight this morning.
Ivy Crest?
Just wait there and you shall receive a sign.  Do not despair and do not go inside.
Why not?  Hello?  Hello, Jesus?
 Crossbow One, radar contact.  Climb and maintain flight level six five oh.
Ah, Mr. Kinsley.  Why am I not surprised to see you here?  Perhaps you have the explanation for this so-called event I'm suppose to witness.
Yes, sir, I do, but first may I take this opportunity to compliment you on  your fashion sense.
 Crossbow One, turn left to two eight zero.
Two eight zero, roger.
Norman, if you'd be so kind. This cockpit mock-up duplicates the shuttle flight deck and we've placed it here to demonstrate the firing technique.
We are thirty one DME from the target.
 Roger, Crossbow. Open the doors.
These are rather strong accusations, Chris.
Yes, sir, I know.
If they're true, I'm going to need some proof.
I think we're going to be able to accommodate you in just a minute, sir.
Power on.
T minus fifty and counting.
 Boy, if this works, he's going to start a new religion.
If it doesn't work ...?
Trajectory command relay, locked.
Now, Norm here has firing control.
What's he doing?
Kent has now started toward the front door.
I told him not to go in!
 Look, this is Jerry's house, we're very close, so if you're not going to answer me, then I'm going in ...
... here I come.
 Kent! Stop!
Target locked. In ten, nine, eight ...
 That looked like Dr. Meredith in a bathrobe. First I'm hearing things, now I'm seeing things.
Okay, God. Let me have it.
... three, two, one, bingo.
 Oh!
Oh, my!
Popcorn?
Kent!
I don't understand. Did it fire?
Yes, we indicate a shot.  We've got another problem, though.  It's not shutting down.
Nice going, Jer.
Something's wrong here.  Unlock the bird's eye.
I'm tracing where the shot went.
Oh, no.
What have you done?
Retired.
 Do you think we used too much?
Maybe a little.
Well, I guess we all learned something here today.
What?
I don't know, but it seemed like the right thing to say, didn't it?
It did to me.
I think  you used too much.
Really? I'm sorry you missed it.
Yeah, well, I had to pack.
Why?
I'm getting married.
What? To whom?
 What is all this?
Oh, I won. Only thirty-one point eight percent though. I have to figure that out. But not this summer.
Sherry?
 Hi. Isn't it wonderful. I finally found him. Number  One. I've been looking for him for ten years.
What can I do?  She loves me.
Right.  Congratulations.
Thanks.  Anyway, we probably won't ever get to see you again, so, bye.
What do you mean?  Where are you going?
I've got a little survival place in Wyoming.  We're going to live there.
Yeah, it's getting too weird around here.  See ya.
You think it's getting too weird around here.
Absolutely.
I didn't notice.
I like it.
