You're too kind.
Why don't you publish the plans?
Yeah, no, I'm saying, that's what I would do, f'I was in the book business. Unfortunately, I'm a thief, so, I have to do that thing. You understand... Joe:

...alright:    what if we...
I'm sorry...
...what do you tell me?     What is it you tell me?
What is it I tell you?
"Any situation, stand it on its head."
Izzat right...
So:  stand it on its head.  What if we...
Sell the beat.  Call the guy, sell the boat.
You quote him our figure, sell it to him for cash.
For cash?
That's the sweetener.
I don't get it.
You say "cash," he knows we're hungry. He'll counter ten, twenny percent less, you kick around, and accept it.
Where's he gonna get the cash at night?
Let him get it tomorrow.   You bring him the title for the boat.
And you?  Hello, Mr. Fletcher...? Could you, I'm looking for Mr. Robert Fletcher.  Would you tell him Fran, from Moore Marine. 
...I'll meet you in Mexico.
How're you going to Mexico...?

What're you gonna do about the Other Guys?
We're gonna play some ringolevio.     I'm gonna need your help--Look here:
You know, in many ways, it isn't their arrogance that hurts, it's the money.
Yeah?    What were you gonna do with the money?
I was gonna buy a scooter for my niece. You know, this's the goddamndest thing I ever saw: They got his face on tap, he's got to Steal Away like the Arabs.
...with what?
Well, what about Times Two. If they stiffed him on Monday, what're they gonna do on Wednesday...
Joe?    He's got something in reserve.
He's got something in the Hole. He wouldn't change his mind without a diversion.
...may it be so.
...and a back-up plan...
...b'cause, b'cause I've spent my cut, the last thing...
...you hold tight with the Crew...
...I hold tight with the Crew, the Crew holds tight with me, is all I'm...
How're we all today?
F'we got somewhere to go, let's go.
Alright.
You'll do the job?
That's right.
I'm sorry I put you in a position.
It's very sporting of you to say so.
Well...
I'm going to need some walking-around money.  And I'm going to need my men's share, on the last job.
That's not unreasonable.
Give it to me

How's that?
The question: how do we get the money from there to here... it's just a question in logistics.

Who said that?
Anybody ever applied for a loan.

Is that so?
That's correct.
What does she see in you, anyway?

You wanna play the dozens. Here you go: They called, there was a bookkeeping error at the Hospital, you died at birth. Your turn...
Joe, leave him...
Eh? Cat got your tongue?   You wanna make peace.

Don't you know when a man's whipped, for chrissake?

What you doin here?
Well, you know, I'm with my friends...
I don't see nobody else here...
No, that's right...
Baby, you shuunt be on the streets, the first place...
...what's the move...?
The move is:  The move is we got to get the gold.
...kids on the street. Always kids on the street.
I can't go for the gold til I can see how to get it home...
Well, then, we just got to think a little harder.
 Yes. That's right.
The nephew don't come back, the first place, you're down on the Tropic Isle.  You shoulda left him on the side of the road.
Uh huh... why'd you leave him the plans?
Why'd I leave him what?
Why'd you leave him the plans?
What...?
He forgot his "cheat sheet."     S'why he came back.
Yeah, no, he din't forget his cheatsheet, cause I got it right here. (HE RUMMAGES IN THE GYMBAG, AND PRODUCES SEVERAL SMALL FOLDERS) What'm'I, going to go leaving papers in the hands of some lame? Are you kidding me...? He said what?
He said that's why he came back.
He came back for me (PAUSE. THEY TURN TO LOOK AT HER.) He came back to make sure I was okay.  I knew him from before.
Well, hell, for the luvva god, we're going to do something, let's do it. Okay. Okay: Fran:
Yes.
You want to suit up?
...that's right.
What's the shot?
 You got to Kiss Rings.
...you point me.
 What're we forgetting...?
How did we get away with the Gold?
Oh yeah. 
Robert the Bruce. Watched this Spider, try, three hours, to spin this web...
Uh huh...
Til finally...
Yeah?
He succeeded. 
That's the worst story I've ever heard.
 And it gave him the Idea.     To conquer Scotland.
I don't get the connection.
 Put him on.
 Are you fucken with me? Are you fucken with me, or are you done fucken with me? Because I've just "financialized" the problem, and you've just become more trouble than you're worth.  She says you're gonna do the job. You said that before, why now? What is it, all a sudden...?  Everyone needs money. That's why they call it "money..."  Well, let me add this sweetener. You do the job. You do the job, r'else I turn you over, I drop a fucken dime on you, you're so hot, I on'y got to dial five digits. How strict is that? How strict is that, you fucken lame? ...I'm sorry that I have to speak this way, in front of a Woman... were it not for who, I'd waste your fucken ass. You said you're goin' the job? Do the job, you're done with the Charade. Save your bold moves for the brilliant players.   I'm sorry for my language.
Well, it's only words.
That's absolutely right.
 You're in my position, what do you do?  What did she tell you?
He's scared.
I've never known him scared.
She says he's getting old.
...she said that...
He's broke. He's made. The cops're looking for him. He don't want to go out there with nothing.  She says that he'll do the job.
...she does...
...she... 
...please...
I think, the thing, she came to plead for him.
...she did.    She came to plead for him?
I think so.
The sonofabitch screwed me once, he's gone screw me again. Why, why, why would she think that I'd believe her?
She came to me...
To you.  Ah.
...yes.
He put her up, to come to you.
I think she came to me on her own. 
Well, no, but as Rational Men, don't we have to "doubt" her?
She thinks the guy's weak, he's scared, she's scared, I think she's sincere.
Then, let me put a question to you: you had the job... you had the job... how would you test her sincerity...?
Okay, we're All on One Team, all arrayed against a Common Enemy? Thank you for coming, I'm an old Man, I'm going to bed...
 I'm going to see you back. 
I'll be alright...
 Hey, you're alright now...

She   is active in the church choir. She has had   her job for sixteen years. Last time I saw   her, she had stomach problems... what's the   response time on the tow truck...?
Average, forty five minutes.
 Too quick...  On the day. Half hour before the thing, call up, three false breakdown calls. Keep'em buys.
...that's right...
You got to givvem breakdown calls on actual vehicles, which means you'll have to go to the Rental...
 What, what kind of "freight do you want to..."
 ...look here:
...and how's he getting his share away...?
...what difference, you're going to screw it out of him anyway...
...what are you telling me...?
...take the wrappers off, hang em in the air, get the drycleaning smell out.
...where have you been...?
...tucking Betty Croft in...
What's she, out all night partying...?

 Alright, then. No Hard Feelings...?

...you think so...?
I was in this firefight? One time? Motherfucker, always carried a bible, next to his heart. And we used to mock him. But that bible stopped a bullet.
No shit.
My hand to god. That bible, stopped a bullet, would have ruined that fucker's heart.  And had he had another bible, in front of his face, that man would be alive today. What time you got?

Don't make me lose my respect for you. By the way, we already had the gold. Pincus gave it up. That's what she traded for your life.  She's got a very commercial mind...
...take it back to the boatyard  Get a number, call'im up, we need a private slip, what do you call it, a shed. Tell'im we'll pay in cash. Get the thing squared away, we'll take the gold out... (THE HENCHMAN STARTS TO GO OFF, NODDING)
 You don't want to stay here, pal. They're coming for you... they're coming for you...
 Leave him some money. Give him some money... don't let him go out there with nothing... 
I'm sorry, baby.
Yeah, we don't want, to send you out there broke... here: go buy yourself something nice... You don't mind if I pay you in Gold...?
A knife, gimme another knife...
...I don't... I need you to tell me where the gold is.
Where's the gold?
Where would you like it to be...?
What is it, with your pal...?
And then   where is he now. Your  running buddy? No, It's   all over, and I need to know: Where Is   The Gold. I hate to do  anything as dramatic   as "counting to Three," but... ONE: 
EMPTY_LINE
Two... why must you, oh, God, why in the world must you, why in the hell, a guy like you, would you put me in a position... Aahh, the Hell with it, life is too short, you know what? Fuck you...
How you doing?
I'm leaking?  You hurt?
 I... I...
Cute.   Very cute.
Don't you want to hear my dying words...?
I just did.
 I hear...
I hear if you put milk into it, it lesses the chance of stomach distress.
Hey, you can't worry about every little thing...
Heat it up?
 No, I think we gotta be moving on.
Too bad about Pinky.
Ain't that so.
...always made me laugh.
Well, what more can you say of anyone?
Nothing...
Robert the Bruce...
Yeah?
Why'd they call him Robert "The" Bruce...
...what?
Why'd they call him Robert "The" Bruce? 
Because he asked them to.
Y'go to that Plastic Surgeon, don't lettem put you all the way under. I knew a guy in Statesville, went to get his face fixed, woke up, sucker'd given him a pair of tits.
Yeah, that's no bargain.
Well, he landed back inside, he never had to want for Cigarettes...
Send your cut there...?
Wire it there, when you get where you're going.
That I will, Pal.
I hear it's nice down there in the Sun.
Zat where I'm going?
Wherever it is, Brother, don't come back. 
Yeah, I knew you'd show.
Good, good plan, baby...
Yeah, I wouldn't clear my throat, without a backup plan...
That's the right way to do it.
End of the day, though, end of the day, what's the important thing...?
That's right.
What's the important thing...? 
Shame about Pinky...
You heard.  Come on, get in.
Y'all loaded up?
C'mon, get in, we'll talk on the road.     You heard about Pinky...
Yeah.   I heard. I'm sorry about that.
Yeah, well, it just went bad there, that little bit. Dinnit...?
Yes, It did.
...yes, it did... it got kind of convincing.
...and, so, you got hurt.
Well, you can't do it halfway, can you...?
No, anything you do, you got to do full-out. Don't you?
Indeed you do.
And, sometimes... 
 Then, that's just the Price.
That's right. That's what you taught me. That's part of it.
Well, but didn't you do great. Played it down to the last recorded syllable...
I went to a good school.
Never seen it done n'y better.   You hotwalked that dude so good.
...thank you, Joe.
Cooled him out the livelong day.   You made it look so real.
 ...yes, you did.
Well, you know... 
...what d'you mean, "that's part of it?"
I don't get you?
I was talking about Pinky.
Uh huh.
I said we paid the price.         And you said.   We paid part of it. 
Yes.    That's right.
...what's the rest of it...?  What's the rest of it...?
Oh. 
Well. They don't always leave with the Ones they came In with.
 Oh.
 It was dead, anyway.  You know it was.
Was it...?
 You shouldn't of sent me to him.
Well, you can't think of everything. 
I'm sorry. 
Well...
I'm sorry...
You knew it was over...
 ...it's in the back.
 Why dun' he shoot me?
Cause it's over. It's all done.    That's the deal.
He ain't gonna shoot me?
No.
Then he hadn't aughta point a gun at me.  It's insincere...
Oh, God, I'm tired...
 I'm sorry, Baby.
Well, no.   You told me, "you knew him before."
That's right. I did.  
Get in and drive  I'm sorry.
You said that.  Well.  You must be under quite a lot of stress.
Hmm.
It was a pretty plan, though, wunnit...?
Cute as a Chinese baby...
Thanks for everything. 
You'll be alright.
You think so?
You always are. 
Well, I missed this trick, though, didn't I...?
...the best laid plans of mice and men...
...what?
I said Nobody's Perfect.  You take care.  Alright, let's go.
