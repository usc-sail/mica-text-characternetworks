We dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and then.   We move to the eyes, pure in their fury.  Finally we encompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode -- muscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and on the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one. He is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken cardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from prison.

The irony, of course, is that this money -- which is in the billions, J i m - - is coming from your country. You are the major purchaser of our national product -- which of course is cocaine.
So what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is -     -    - doing business with the very same government that floods those' streets with cocaine.. -that's a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?

 The United States Government has.to stop supporting these facist  gang- sters that are running my country, that is what your country has to do.  You have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights.

2nd Rev. 11/X/82 .a-. Tony in the backseat of the Corniche      with Chi-Chi studies the house from across the curb.   It's    quiet, rich, suburban, not calling attention to itself.
 Wait here. He approaches the front door, listening, the hand sliding into his pocket.  Inside a wistful Billy Joel song plays over the stereo. He rings a buzzer, waits. the pause. The door opens casually. Standing             there Hold is Manny -- with a towel around his waist.
GINA Manny!
Manny!
You     killed       him? Shaking     her     head     at    him    incredulously.
We got married just yesterday. We were gonna surprise you.
Manolo, oh Manolo, what'd                  he     do?.. What'd he do? She hugs his corpse tightly to her                        breast and       makes horrible strangled sounds with her                        throat.

Noooooooooooo! And shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony, screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill him.   She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious, numbed.
 Get     the body!
Tony!
Yeah!

Flashing his silver tooter, Tony snorts a truly giant amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the length of coffee table. Pause   as he   lets it sink in.

In far b-g. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see: The main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into                       (X view, checks the gate, turns.  Suddenly two figures spring out at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He struggles. Another monitor now reveals two more figures moving into the interior of the guard shack. They knife the other Marielito A    third   monitor.    carries     another   image   of    shadows   moving through the trees on the estate. On the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost incoherent. TONY ...I said to you, Manny, I said I never go crazy and you said, I would you sonofabitch and you was right... those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we'd do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh --   the   fucking      best.... As  Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade.                     A shadow starts climbing up as: TONY ...we still are Manny, we still are -- see, I'm gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there, I'm gonna run the market, I'm gonna be King Cocaine you hear me, you buy you buy from me -- Tony Montana. Covers of all the magazines.       Fan     mail.     Television stars, movie stars, shooting              stars -- he's a star....
Rev. X/21/82 (Xl As he crosses into his office, the                           camera moves to      reveal Gina standing there half-dressed in                          the     doorway,   her eyes blazing with hatred. Tony     sees   her.
Is     this    what       you want      Tony?... Tony     shocked.
You can't stand another man                         touching me.  So you want me Tony, is                        that it? Well here I am 0-T She    fires    the    Baretta       we    now   see    in    her    hand.

Come and get me Tony.                   Before       it's too     late.

We catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull, moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly underneath the balcony on which Tony stands.
 Hey     Gina come on, you still angry at me?      I didn't mean to kill Manny, I was..    .I   was.

There's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door     (X: of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over at the monitors. One of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door pounding it. CHI-CHI Boss !    Hey boss.     Open up! On the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire down into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade goes off, blows him up against the door. TONY Cheeee! He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his sideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks up at the monitor. On the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs. Three of them are already huddled outside the door, around the corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out. Tony loading his rocket, ihtends to beat them to the punch, talking to himself. TONY So you wanna play hunh, say hello                    (XI to my little friend here. Karroooomph! The rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian It sounds like punks off the landing into the foyer. Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly.

Who you think I am? I kill all you fuckin' assholes.  I take you all to fuckin' hell! Left.    Right Another hitter   drops,   screaming, off the stairs into the pool below. A grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing away.  Laughing like a madman.
You need an army you hear!    An army to kill me! Behind him we see the remainder of the     pound of cocaine go up in a burst of wind, whipping around    the office in auras of white.  It is a ghostly effect out     of which now appears the face of the Skull moving from the     terrace towards    _ Tony's back with a sawed-off shotgun. TONY Ha ha ha ha ha! You whores, you scum, I piss in your faces !!!! Ha ha ha ha ha!! Skull, now inches from Tony's back,     pulls   the   trigger The and blows Tony's spine out his belly. Tony crashes forward over the bannister into the interior swimming pool below. He floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters. As the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme is expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety. The camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters.   It says: "THE WORLD IS YOURS" And so, for the brief moment, it was. CONTINUED
