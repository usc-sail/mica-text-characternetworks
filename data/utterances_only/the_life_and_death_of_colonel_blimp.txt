Message from the Corps, sir.]]
Message has just arrived, Spud.
What's the ruddy idea?
It's total war, isn't it? What do you want?
Message from H.Q. Where's the C.O.?
In the barn. Follow me.
Message from H.Q., sir.]
Read it, [Sgt. Hawkins].
[It's in code, sir.]  'Message begins: Exercise Invasion of London Area by Regular Army, Home Guard defending. War starts at midnight. Message ends.'  The C.O.'s put in pencil [here], sir, 'Make it like the real thing.'
[[Platoon Commanders]][Oh, he has, has he? Section commanders!]
[[Gentlemen!]]  [Message from H.Q.] War starts at midnight. You have your orders. Tell the men!
Ay, ay, sir.
And tell them to make it like the real thing.
What do they mean by 'like the real thing', Spud?
 [Well,] obviously [[prisoners must be bayoneted to death, women must be raped,]]our losses divided by ten and the enemy's multiplied by twenty!
Yessir.]]
Anything else for me, sir?
No.]
'War starts at midnight'. We know.
 They know.]
We attack.
They counter-attack.
Like the real thing - my Aunt Fanny! Like the real thing--
LIKE THE REAL THING! Sergeant Hawkins![[Stuffy, Robin, Tommy]] [Section commanders!]
So War starts at midnight, does it? [[Sergeant-Major!]]
Sir!
We attack at six!  [[We'll]] take all the [tommy-guns and][[Brens and three - no]] four [no, three] trucks. Section leaders with tommy-guns. Arm the men with [bombs,] rifles, bayonets.[[fifty rounds of spare, pick handles.  I'll need all the officers]].
Yessir.
Tommy, [from your section] - Rice, Unsworth, [yes] the Owens, Nobby, Toots and Cochrane?
Not Cochrane, sir.
All right, I leave it to you.] Stuffy, who are the biggest toughs in your lot?
Bill Wall, Wimpey, Popeye, Wizard...
Yours Robin?
Frank, Skeets and Duggie Stuart [Taffy, Geordie and Dai Evans.]
 We must have him, look you.  All right. Get going!][[We'll make it real for them.]]
Excuse me, sir.
Yes.
Did you say that we attack before war is declared?
Yes, like Pearl Harbour. Now get going. Oh, by the way, there's just one stop, at the Bull. I've got a date there with Mata Hari.
Careless talk...
Yeah. Now scram.]
Five minutes easy, Sergeant. (Calls to another truck.) Five minutes easy, Stuffy.
I wonder what's keeping Spud?
Afternoon, Sergeant.
 Afternoon, miss.  Hey!
Back in the trucks!]
See that barricade, my [[hearties]] [boys.  Well] at midnight it's going to be closed.
And [[none of the wicked enemy can pass]] [of course the enemy can't get] through before because - [why?]
 WAR STARTS AT MIDNIGHT!
What's the objective, sir?
[[Boodles Club, 28 St James's Street]] [Royal Bathers' Club, Piccadilly.] You all know your stuff?
Yessir!
What about Mata Hari?
We'll beat her to it.
I know a couple of short cuts after Marble Arch.
Are the other trucks O.K.?
Right behind us, sir.]]
Barricade ahead, sir.  It's open!
There she is! Get the other truck to close up. See if you can pass her.
Blast that taxi! Steady, keep right on his tail. Second left.  We've got her!
Come on, Section No.2.
Yessir!
No.3.
Yessir!
You have your orders.]
 Is [[Major-]]General Wynne-Candy in the Club?
No, sir. The General left an hour ago with Brigadier-General Caldicott and Air Vice-Marshal Lloyd-Hughes.
Did he say where he was going?
Excuse me, sir, what is your business with the General?
I have a message for him - an urgent message.
If you will give me the message, sir, I will see that the General gets it.
But dammit all, man - ! (Suddenly changes tone.) Are you in the Home Guard?
[[Are you]][Why], sir?
 The password is 'Veuve Cliquot 1911'!
 The General and his staff [[have gone to]][are in] the Turkish Baths, sir.
 Right!]
 You're in charge up here.] Stay with him.  Don't leave your [[cubby-hole]][desk] or [[answer]][use] the phone. You're a prisoner of war.
But war starts at midnight.
Ah ha, that's what you think. Sergeant, that girl under the desk: she's a prisoner too.
Sir!
Corporal, follow me. Brute force and ruddy ignorance.
 Come on, after him  and double up.
Sergeant-Major!
Sir?
See that girl in the phone-box?
Yessire.
Nail her in!
Yessir.  Owen!
Rice!  Wimpey!  Stand guard!
Sir.
Sir.
 [[You're a prisoner of war!]]  [Don't argue!]  Wizard! Guard this man.  And answer that dam' phone!
[Yes, miss.] Warn who, miss?  General Wynne-Candy, miss?  Can't do that, miss. (Holds receiver away from his ear as girl's voice screams.)
 Porter!  Hullo!  Hullo!
Yes, miss.  Sorry, miss,]] the General's a prisoner of war.  [[Yes, miss.  You're a prisoner of war too.]] [And so are you.] (Listens, then suddenly gets impatient.) You're NUTS! The War's over! 
All right, boys!  Surround 'em!]]
Qu-i-e-t!  Quiet, please. You're all prisoners. Now stay where you are.  Where's General Wynne-Candy?
Who, sir?
You heard. Now show me the way. Come on.]
 This is it.] Sir!  SIR!
 Go away.
General Wynne-Candy!]
Hm - What  Who is it?
Lieutenant Wilson, sir.  2nd Battalion, the [[Devonshires]] [Loamshires], sir.
Hm! (He is still half asleep.) What['s the matter]][do you want], eh?
Well, sir ... I'm afraid, sir ... ('After all, he is a General.')
Well? - Say it, man! I've no time to waste!
 Oh, yes, you have, sir!
I beg your pardon, sir?
You've got all night, sir.
Attendant!
I'm afraid he can't come.
 [[Can't come!  Can't - attendant!]] Why?
He's a prisoner of war.
 What's going on here?
Invasion[, sir.]
Do - you - know - who - you - are - talking to, sir?
Yes, sir.  I am addressing Major- General Clive Wynne-Candy, General Officer Commanding the Home Guard, exercise Beer-Mug, sir.  You and your staff are my prisoners.
 I say, Suggie, this is a devil of a mess!]]
 But you damned young idiot, war starts at midnight! Haven't you been told!
 Yes, sir. That's why we're here.
And may I ask [[again]], on-what- authority?
On the authority of these guns and these men[, sir].
Authority  authority  how dare you, sir  how dare you - [[I'll have you for this - I'll - ]] GET OUT OF HERE SIR YOU AND YOUR GANG OF AWFUL MILITIA GANGSTERS [[I'LL HAVE YOU]][GET OUT!]- (He suddenly stops a little helplessly.)
 [[STUFFY!]][Popeye, guard these Men.]
YESSIR!]]
YESSIR!]
Stuffy. Go to the cubicles. Find which is General Wynne-Candy's. [[Threr'll be]][You'll find] a brown pigskin case there. Bring it.
Yessir. 
But you can't do that!  The code is in that case! The whole Exercise will be a farce if you have that code!
 It's a farce already!]][Oh no, sir. This is going to be the real thing, sir.
But war starts at midnight.
Oh yes].  You say, 'War starts at midnight' - how do you know the enemy says so too?
 But my dear fellow, that was agreed, wasn't it?
 Agreed, my - foot! [[What's agreement got to do with it?]]  How many agreements have been kept by the enemy since this War started?  [[Why do we believe again and again what they are telling us?  Why have we always waited for him at the front of the house while he steals in through the back door and kicks us in the pants?  Tell me why, sir.
I'll tell you, sir!  Because]]we agree to keep the Rules of the Game, [[that's why]] [and they keep kicking us in the seat of the pants!][[Don't forget another agreement]]  When [[we]] [I] joined the Army, [[we agreed to defend our country by every means at our disposal!]] [the only agreement I entered into was to defend my country by any means at my disposal], not only by National Sporting Club Rules but by every means that has existed since Cain slugged Abel!
Stop ...]
Don't we know they're counting on us to keep to the Rules. Don't we know it's a standing joke with them, that they boast about it, that they -
STOP [IT]!
Lieutenant Watson - or whatever your name is  you are not [[on a platform]]in Hyde Park with an audience of [[tarts and]]loafers. [[This is General Wyndham Cook.]] I am Major-General Wynne-Candy. These other gentlemen have all seen service, distinguished service, with the British Army!
 Well, all I can say is, sir, that when Napoleon said an army marches on its stomach [he must have been thinking of old gentlemen like]] - I'd better stop, sir!
 You're an extremely impudent young officer, sir. But let me tell you that in forty years [time] you'll be an old gentleman, too. And if your belly keeps pace with your head, you'll have a bigger one than any of us!
Maybe I shall. In forty years. But I [[I'll bet that you were the same in the last war.  And forty years ago!]] [I Doubt it. And I doubt if I'll have time to grow a moustache like yours, sir. But at least in 1983 I'll be able to say I was a fellow of enterprise.]
I'll punch your head for that, young fellow! I'll punch your head!  Put 'em up! D'you hear me?  Think you can say what you like to an old 'un, do you? [[I'll teach you!]]  Do you know how many wars I've been in?  I was fighting for my country when your father was still in bum-freezers!  [[You set up to teach me what a soldier should or shouldn't do - (he gets a bit tangled up from the foam like Venus) - Pah!]]  Puppy!  Gangster![[I repeat! Gangster!]]
 How do you know what sort of man I was - when I was as young as you are forty years ago  forty years ago
Everything you want, Mr Candy, sir?
Yes, thank you.]
Quiet! People are trying to sleep!
Suggie?
Hoppy! My old horse [[my antique stallion]]!  Since when are you in London?
Got back yesterday. Sick leave. I've been chasing you all over town.  I say, old chap, I was awfully sorry to hear about your leg -
Jumping Jehosaphat! They're both there!
What the hell did you think I was standing on?
I thought you had a wooden leg.
Why should I have a wooden leg?
They told me in Bloemfontein that they cut off your left leg.
Can't have, old boy. I'd have known about it.
I got it in the shoulder.
 Can't see a thing.  Now whose leg do you suppose they really cut off?
It's the other one 
 What do you mean?
Here.
Oh, I see.  So it is.  Stop you playing polo?
Not much. Where are you putting up?
Stayed at Horsey Loudon's last night - you know he married little Nancy Thingumabob?
No!
Fact! But I found out this morning that they sport a phonograph. So I said to Horsey - by the way, the old boy's putting on weight - 'Sorry, old man, thanks for the doss down but phonographs are barred!'
 Don't blame you. Serious matter - phonographs.
 I'd hate it to burst out one morning with -
 Mouldy pipes, you've got.
Mouldy? My pipes? (He pulls out all the stops.)
 Attendant!  Attendant! Confound it! I'll never get to sleep again. Stop that confounded Covent Garden CATERWAULING!!
 See! My pipes!
My shoes!
 Don't go, sir! We're evacuating!  'Cherries so red!  Strawberries ripe!  At home of course they'll be storming.  Never mind the abuse!  You've had the excuse! You've BEEN TO COVENT GARDEN IN THE MORNING!'
My shoes!
Quiet!
Stop that noise! Attendant!
MY SHOES!!]]
Call a cabby, porter!
Yes, sir. 
Hansom, mind! Growlers barred.
[[Of course]] [He knows], sir.
 Could have done with a nap myself.
You've got all night, haven't you?
[[Must go]] [Going] to the theatre tonight.
Can't you sleep there?
Invited. Two ladies.
Can I come along?
One is the mother.
Hansom, gentlemen.]]
Your cab, sir.]
Ha! The opera-singers, eh?  No wonder civilians are grumbling about the Army!  Ought to be ashamed of yourselves - yelling and screaming like some damned foreigner!  A nice state of things!  Officers and men losing their lives in South Africa while young officers are roaring about public places like drunkards - (A sudden idea strikes him.) Perhaps you are drunk.  [[Let me smell your breath! 
Eh? What's this?
V[[ictoria]] C[[ross]], sir.
Where d'you get it, eh?
South Africa - [Jordaan Siding], sir. [[Windhoek.]]
You're Candy, 'Sugar' Candy?
Yes, sir.
Hm! [[Heard of you!]]  Good show, Candy.
Thank you, sir.
[[2nd Lieutenant]] Hopwell, sir.
Hopwell-Hopwell!  [What,] Son of Barney Hopwell of the 66th?
Yes, sir.
 Glad to know you, my boy.  You're very musical[[, you two]]?
No, sir.
 And so are you.]
[[You mean the Brnhilde Aria, Sir?]] [D'you mean Mignon, sir, 'I am Titania'?]
[[Whathlde]][You're what?]
[[Brnhilde]][Titania], sir. We two were shut up with her in a blockhouse for seven months near Jordaan Siding
 [[With Matilda?]] [I beg your pardon?]
[[Brhilde, sir.  Character in opera by Wagner.]] [It's an aria, sir.] We had a phonograph and we broke every record but this one. We know it by heart.
Hahahaha! [[Dashed good.]]  Well, are you boys going to the 
Yes, sir.
That's where I'm lying.
Can I give you a lift?
No thank you, sir. We have a cab.
 St James's Palace.
Right, sir.]
Well, I hope you two [[lads]][boys] enjoy your leave: you've earned it.
Thank you, sir. [Mind yourself on the door, sir.]
The old horse thief!
[[Porter]] [Boy]!  Another hansom!
No, we've just come over for a warm. (An early automobile passes.)
 You ever ridden in one?
Rather. All the way to Epsom.
Lovely lines, hasn't she?
Topping.]
 Same beastly [[raw]] drizzle!  Same [[old slush]] [fog] and soot! Good old London!
 Now listen, Suggie! Remember that interview you gave The Times'?
You don't mean to say you read it?
Me? No! But I have a niece[[.She]] - [who] has a governess [[and the governess]] [who] has a sister.
Pretty?
[[I don't know her from Adam.]] Never laid eyes on her. But she read it.
 Who?
My niece's governess's sister. In Berlin. So she wrote to her sister here, who gave the letter to my niece to give to me to give to you. [See?]]
 Who do I give it to?
Nobody. It's for you. Here it is.
 Why [[me]]?
[Well,] read it[, you big ape]. You'll [[see]] [find out].  It's interesting.
Sit down!
 Thank you, sir.
Fire away!
Well, sir, I have a friend--
Good. Not everybody can say that. Continue!
This friend of mine, sir, has a niece--
 One!
 A girl wrote it from Berlin, sir. Her name is Edith Hunter. She's a governess there.
[Rather an] Uncomfortable billet just now.
That's just it, sir. They hate us in Germany. They are spreading propaganda all over Europe that we are killing women and children in South Africa, that we are starving them in concentration camps, shooting mothers, burning babies - you wouldn't believe the things they have invented!  I spoke this afternoon to Conan Doyle. He thinks something ought to be done about it too.
About what? [[Where does this letter of yours come in?]] [What's all this about a letter?] And who's Conan Doyle?
The author chap, sir-writes the Sherlock Holmes  , stories in the Strand Magazine.
This Doyle fellow writes the Sherlock Holmes stories?
Yes, sir. Conan Doyle. You must have seen his name.
Never heard of him. But I've read every Sherlock Holmes story since they started in July '91.
 Are you reading The Hound of the Baskervilles, sir?
Am I not!  What did you think of the end of the last instalment?
Bit of a facer for poor old Watson, sir.
 'A lovely evening, my dear Watson. I really think you will be more comfortable outside than in.'  Sarcastic devil, that [fellow] Holmes. I once had a C.O. just like him. [[This Conan Doyle]] [He] must be [[a sound sort of]] [rather a good] fellow, as authors go.
 Well, sir, Mr Conan Doyle is collecting material about our campaign in South Africa to counter German propaganda. The Times printed an interview with me about seven weeks ago -
That's bad. Good rule to keep out of the papers. Still The Times is a bit different.
 Mmm, yes.]
Yes, sir. I mentioned in the interview the name of a place called Jordaan Siding. I spent seven months there. Now this girl writes from Berlin that the worst stories of all are being put about by a fellow called Kaunitz who says he saw with his own eyes British soldiers kill two hundred and fifty women and children at Jordaan Siding in order to save feeding them!
Do you know this fellow Kaunitz?
Of course, sir. He's the most awful little [[skunk]] [rat]!  He was spying for us, he was spying for the Boers, he made South Africa too hot for himself and skipped. Both sides would have shot him if they'd caught him.
I see. Now what do you want me to do?
 My leave isn't up for four weeks, sir. Why shouldn't I go to Berlin and confront this little rat? I'll soon-
 My dear boy - first of all, it's not done. This isn't Army business, it's Embassy. Leave politics to the politicians. You wouldn't like a diplomat to come charging into the front line with your company, would you?
It might do him a lot of good!
 Juvenile nonsense, my lad!
 Sorry, sir!
That's right Candy.  Never go off at half-cock, my boy.  Keep cool.  Keep your mouth shut.  Avoid politicians, like the plague.  That's the way to get on in the army.
Yes, sir.]]
You were [[given leave]] [sent home] in order to recuperate. Your country needs you. Play golf?
Yes, sir.
What's your form?
About ten, sir.
 Care for a game?
Sorry, sir. I'm invited by Lady Gilpin to Leicestershire. Start tomorrow.
Well, enjoy yourself.
By-the-way, [[this fellow]] - this author chap.
Author chap?
This fellow] who wrote The Hound of the Baskervilles -
[[Yes, sir?]] Conan Doyle.
[Yes.] You didn't happen to ask him, by any chance, what happens in the next instalment?
 Just a moment.]
Yes, sir. There's another murder!
 Not the Baronet?
No, sir. The Baronet is safe.
 [Good,] I'm glad -
Warm for January.
Damn cold I call it.
Take my tip, my boy. You've got a damn good V.C., now keep quiet for a bit, eh?
Well?  What did he say?
 'Lovely evening, my dear Watson!'
What?
 'You'll be more comfortable outside than in'
You're cracked.  Did he say you could go?
 'Leave politics to the politicians!'
 Are you going or aren't you?
 Yes!
With or without approval?
Well, he didn't say I couldn't.
If I ask somebody else, they may forbid me to go.  Look here, do you want to go to the Theatre tonight?
Well I like that you said -
Never mind what I said.  Here!  Box A, Her Majesty's Theatre. 'The Last of the Dandies'. Introduce yourself to Lady Gilpin - tell them I had to go on [[Secret Service]] [some secret mission] - make me out a mysterious romantic figure. The girl's [[nice]] [pretty], the mother's a Gorgon.
[[You mean you're going straight away?]] Are you going on a secret mission?
[[Of course.]] [Yes, to Berlin.
Did he send you?
No, it's a secret from him too.]
But - how will you go?
Cab, Boat-train, boat, another train - they must have trains in Germany as well as here.  Fitzroy is some sort of Secretary at the Berlin Embassy. I'll wire him I'm coming and I'll wire the girl from my hotel.
Hotel...?
Well, they must have hotels in Berlin, too.]]
 Come in!
 Cumman zee hairin!
Das Frulein wartet im kleinen Salon.
 Fraulein - Edith Hunter - here?
Jawohl - im kleinen Salon - klein! (Gestures with hand to show 'klein' means 'little'.) Klein - Salon!
Morning, Preedy. Did you send those flowers?
Yes, sir. Oh, Mr Hopwell, there's a postcard for you, sir.
From Mr Candy, ha.
How is Mr Candy?
Read it for yourself, 
 Das 1st die Dame in demkleinen Salon.
[[You are Lieutenant Candy]] [Mr Candy], I believe.
[[In England.  Here I'm plain Mister. You are Miss Hunter?]]  [Miss Hunter?]
Yes. Thank you for your telegram. It came as a great surprise to me. I had no idea you were in Berlin.
Nor had I until now.
I beg your pardon.
I only arrived yesterday.
 Do you  can you possibly mean that you have come solely on account of my letter?
Well - naturally.
 Oh!
 You don't mind - do you?
 No. Of course not.
Well... (She still stares, forgetting her manners.) Shall we sit down?
Did you have a good journey?
Excellent.  I'm sorry to bring you out in such weather. I was about to call on you.
I have changed my address.
Indeed?
Yes. My position became intolerable. I have had to leave.
No.
 English people are not very popular in Berlin at the moment you know.
Do you mean that you had to give up your job because you are English?
Yes.
Can you get another job?
Perhaps. In a few months' time. Not now.
Well, what are you going to do now...
Go back.
To England?
 I'm afraid so.
Cheer up!  England isn't as bad as all that.
 That is what we both want to prove, isn't it, Mr Candy?
 Yes, Miss Hunter.
How shall we begin?
You mentioned in your letter a man called Kaunitz. Do you know what he looks like?
I've never seen him.
Because if he's the same fellow I hope he is, I'd like a word with him.]]
I know a cafe where he and his friends have their Stammtisch - it means they have a table regularly reserved for them there... a kind of...
 Do you know any of his friends, Miss Hunter?
 Yes, one. A student, the brother of my employer -  My ex-employer. He is a Burschenschafter. Do you know what 'Burschenschafts' are?
 No, Miss Hunter.
They are Associations of Students professing Political Principles. They assert them by drinking beer and fighting duels.
[[I see.]] Duelling is very popular here, I believe?
Oh, yes. It's a proud father that has a scarred son, and vice-versa. German girls find scars very attractive.
A book was published recently on the German colonies in which it was specifically stated that one of the advantages of possessing duelling- scars was that the natives of Africa look with more respect upon white men who bear them than upon those who do not.
 I feel like Stanley and Livingstone.
Surely not both, Mr Candy.
No, of course not. You are Miss Livingstone.  I'm the missionary!
Coldly Livingstone was the missionary, Mr Candy.
 Ah - yes  of course he was.  Well, what about this cafe? Can you take me there tonight?
Do you wish me to accompany you?
Well, of course.
 Very well.
 I mean - it's awfully kind of you - I'd obviously be absolutely lost without you.
EMPTY_LINE
 Mr Fitzroy!
All right, Yenning, I'm coming...
Look here, old man, I'll come back another time. I didn't know you were as busy as all this.
Always on Tuesdays...
When can we get together?
What about Saturday? We could have a drink or something...
I'll be on my way back by then. Well, Baby-Face,  Pity you're so busy. I wanted to have a talk with you.
You must feel like Baden-Powell in Mafeking ...
Eh?
... besieged on all sides.
Oh! You mean that crowd in the waiting room?
 Five past, Mr Fitzroy. 
All right, Yenning.  Well, they'll have to wait that's all. I'll tell Yenning to take you out the back way so that you won't be bothered by them.
They don't bother me. They prove I was right to come here.
Why? Are you working for Thomas Cook?
What the deuce d'you mean?
Well, they all want to go back to England, they? How do I know what you mean?
 If you'll listen I'll tell you. They want to go back because they've lost their jobs. Why have they lost their jobs? Because of anti-British propaganda. Because of liars like Kaunitz.
 Kaunitz? Who's he?
Don't you ever read the papers, man?
We have a Press Attache who ...
 But you ought to know about him yourself. It's his lies that are filling your waiting room. Don't you know that he's accusing us of murdering women and children in South Africa?
What do you mean 'us'? I haven't murdered anybody.
US! you silly ass! US, the British Army!
 Are you in the Army?
 Yes, I am!  And I've been in South Africa!  And I know Kaunitz, if nobody else does in this place that calls itself an Embassy!
My dear Suggie, don't get so excited...
 Shut up! And STAND UP when I speak to you!
Ye Gods and Little Fishes! Skates! What is this! The British Embassy or a Winter Sports' Club?
 I was just trying them on when you came in. (He tries to regain his important tone.) I have to go skating with the daughter of the Second Secretary. I'm late already...
 I hope you break your silly neck! And the silly neck of the silly Second Secretary's silly pudding-faced daughter! And now I'm going to find Kaunitz and pull his nose for him - HARD! Goodbye.
Ten past, Mr Fitzroy.
 He's mad! Absolutely mad!  We were at Harrow together, Yenning. All this nonsense about Kaunitz.
KAUNITZ! But I say! He must be stopped!  He's going to make an awful scandal! Just now, too! Stop him, Yenning! Stop him!
 Oh, damn these skates!
 Yes - my dear Candy - I think I understand. It's not a bad idea. Unfortunately there are complications.
It seemed clear enough to me.
 Yet there are one or two things you may not know. (It is a charming smile.) First there is the 'Alldeutscher Verband'.
Yes, sir. I've heard about them.
Indeed? From whom?
From a young lady who lost her job because of anti-British propaganda.
Ah, yes, I see. Then she will have told you that the whole propaganda against us is party-politics - a slogan for the banner of this Alldeutscher Verband. The German Government has officially condemned it.
But how about all these mass-meetings, sir - in Cologne and Dresden - how do we know how the German People --
Let us leave the German People out of it, shall we? In Germany there is only one man who counts: the Kaiser; and the Kaiser desires only the friendliest relations with England.
He's got a funny way of showing it.
I assure you it is true. But let me come to my second point. I propose to make you a present of a piece of highly confidential information.  The Prince of Wales is coming to Berlin.
 No! When?
On the 27th of January. I repeat this is strictly in confidence.  The official reason is the Kaiser's birthday party. But it has been arranged that both His Royal Highness and His Imperial Majesty will make a speech; and their speeches will put the seal on the agreements of friendship between the two countries.  So you see what harm your solitary exploit might do, Candy. Not that I don't admire your pluck - especially, may I say, as a soldier on active service, who certainly needs a permit to cross the Channel...
I am not on active service, sir. I am on sick leave.
Oh, we know all about you. There are not many Candys with the V.C.
You see, a soldier who has won the V.C. is not an ordinary soldier. His views, like his deeds, receive more attention than those of the average man. So, should trouble result from your actions here, it would be more than average trouble.  Well?
 Of course, sir, if His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales is...
Exactly. That is the correct attitude and, after all, you could hardly have known about it, could you? (He has looked at his watch.) You have missed the afternoon train. Pity. It's an excellent train. But you can take it tomorrow.  Why don't you show Candy the town tonight, Fitzroy ? You could take him to the Opera!
Thank you, sir, but I have an appointment tonight.
It was an idea of yours, Candy. Don't run away with the idea that I think it isn't. But, next time, do ask the advice of some older man.  Experientia docet, you know. Take advantage of the experience of age. Goodbye, my boy! A pleasant crossing!
Thank you, sir.
 Show Candy the way out, Fitzroy, and then come back. I want a word with you.
Yes, sir.
Thank you I know the way out.
[[773]] [93]...It is a song-all the rage just now: 'Die Mull...', The Mill Went Round and Round', Mr Candy.
Miss Hunter. I am afraid I have met you here under false pretences.
Indeed! Why?
There are  political complications. [The Prince of Wales is coming to Berlin. He's invited to the Kaiser's birthday party. A goodwill visit, all that sort of thing, you know.
Yes, I know. It is in the papers.
You see, Miss Hunter, I know a chap in our Embassy here. We were at school together. His name's Fitzroy, only we used to call him 'Baby-Face'.
But how are the Prince of Wales and your friend Baby-Face connected?
Well, you see, he nearly had a fit when he knew why I'd come - Baby- Face, I mean. He dragged me in to see the First Secretary, and he nearly had a fit too. A possible scandal, you know.
Are you coming to a point, Mr Candy?
The point is that] I had to promise to do nothing. [And I went bail for you too.] Apparently it's a matter for careful diplomacy. You can see what they mean.
 Yes, of course.
I know nothing about politics.[[I rather flew off the handle, I'm affraid... sticking my nose in where I'm not wanted...] [I stuck my head in where I wasn't wanted] and I could get [[in all kinds of]] [into the most awful] trouble.
 Trouble, Mr Candy?
Well - I am a soldier - you know that, Miss Hunter.
I thought you were a soldier this morning, Mr Candy.  Or have you joined the Army since luncheon.
 [[I beg your pordon.]] 
 [[Look!  That is their table]] [Table's filling up].
Whose table?
Don't you remember the Stammtisch? That is where Kaunitz will sit.
You know, it's a bit staggering to see a girl take such an interest in politics.
Politics?
Well, what else would you call it? German propaganda against England counter-propaganda - the Alldeutscher Verband  that's politics, isn't it?
Not for me-nor for a lot of people. You see, when our Embassy in Berlin reports to the Foreign Office in London that 'a slight change is visible in the attitude of the German nationals towards the Boer question', I have to report in my letter home that I have lost my position and am returning to the bosom of my family.
I suppose they will be rather sick about it.
On the contrary, they will welcome me with open arms.
 [[Oh.]] [I don't blame them either.]
You see, Mr Candy, my family was opposed to my going to Berlin.  They said that the best place for a young girl is Home.
 Quite so!
 Why?
 What do you mean - 'Why?'
How do you know what is the best place for a girl? Are you a girl?
 Well, really, Miss Hunter ...
 Have you any daughters?
I say-really ...
 [[I know I'm not being fair on you. But]] [You see,] while you've been fighting, we women have been thinking. Think [for] yourself, Mr Candy. What careers are [there] open to a woman?
 She can get married.
 I was just going to -
But suppose she doesn't want to 'get married'? (She pronounces the two words with delicate scorn.) She can go and be a governess. But what does a governess know, Mr Candy? Nothing I assure you. So what can she teach the children in her charge? Very little except good manners - if she herself has good manners.
Still - good manners are important.
Did you [[discover]] [learn] that in South Africa, Mr Candy?  My brothers say good manners cost us Magerfontein, Stormberg and Colenso, six thousand men killed, twenty thousand wounded and two years of war when, with a little commonsense and bad manners, there would have been no war at all!
One thing I don't understand, Miss Hunter, is why you have to teach German children manners. I should have thought there were plenty of English kids who -
I will tell you, if you promise not to laugh.
Promise!
My only asset is a fluent command of English.
 Hear! Hear!
 Obviously to teach English in England is to carry coals to Newcastle  and correspondingly ill-paid.  I therefore decided to obtain a post in Germany, where [my] English would command a premium; and, having learnt German, to return to England where my German [[would]]--
Well, I'll be sugared!
That is he?
It's him all right, the little skunk!
Well, shall we go? (Gathering together her things.)
Go? Oh, yes I suppose so. 
 History will remember this as the great Retreat from the Cafe Hohenzollern.
 Just a second. Please.
Here we are! Can we ask the orchestra to play [[139]] [141]?
Why - yes. Call a waiter. Herr Ober!
 Herr Ober!
Why it's [[Wagner The Brnhilde Aria]] [Mignon, 'I am Titania'.] Do you really like
Please! Ask him!  I'll explain later. [[One-three-nine]] [One-four-one]. And please ask for the bill.
Kaunitz was a prisoner in our blockhouse for seven weeks. This was the only record we had on our phonograph. I want to see if he remembers it.
Touched him on the raw all right!
 He's calling the waiter!
Herr Ober!  Is it done to bribe the orchestra?
 Not with money! [Beer!]  Bier fur das Orchester!
 He's going to stop it.
Oh dear! He's going to stop!
[[Cheer up!]] [Round one to Kaunitz.] Reinforcements are coming!
Now what?]]
He's coming up!
Let's go, Mr Candy.
 Bit late now.]
I hope he doesn't see you!
 I hope he does!
Hullo, Kaunitz!
[[Das ist ja gut um wahr zu! ('This is too good to be true.']]) [Das ist ja eine schne Uberraschung, Herr Candy. ('This is a pleasant surprise, Mr Candy.'])
Come on, Kaunitz, you speak English!
I do. But I prefer German!
Meine Damen und Herren!
Let's us go, Mr Candy!
 Bit late now!]]
 Stop it, Kaunitz, I'm with a lady.
You should have thought of that before you started your little joke!
 Stop it, Kaunitz!
 Take off your hands!
Kameraden!
Durchlassen!  Platzmachen.  Zurzck!
 Lass mich los, du Schwein!  Kameraden!   You English swine! - You English murderer! - (He spits in CLIVE'S face.)
 Rasch!  Hilf mir, Hans! ('Quick! Give me a hand Hans')
 Sie werden dafr Rechemschaft geben, sie Flegal! ('You will have to give satisfaction for this, you loafer!')
 Please tell him that it's his fault--  -he started it!
 Englanderl.
 Unerhdrt! 
Meine Herren! Bitte keinen Skandal! Bitte, nehmen Sie Ihre Platze ein! ('Gentlemen! Please, no scandal! Please return to your tables!')
 Eine Schande!  Sie dulden englische Schweine in Ihrem Lokal! ('Scandal yourself! Allowing English pigs into your cafe!')
 Wir haben gar nichts gemacht! ('We haven't done anything!')
 Wir haben nichts mit Ihnen zu tun, Fraulein! (' We have nothing to do with you, miss.')
 Manners!
Ich spreche Englisch!   You shall get into great trouble, my man! You are not now in England.
You saw very well that he asked for it!
Was sagt er? 
Was sagt er? 
 Herr Kaunitz is the friend of us! You [[shall]] [will] satisfaction give!
Please stop shouting!  You don't [[know who this gentleman is]] [understand]!  He--  --and Herr Kaunitz are old friends!
Was sagt er?
 It's going a bit far to call that skunk a friend of mine!
 Herr Kaunitz is a member of der Alldeutsche Verband!
Then the Alldeutscher Verband ought to be ashamed of itself.
Was sagter?
 Mein Herr!  Officers of the Imperial German Army are members of der Alldeutsche Verband!
Then the officers of the Imperial German Army ought to be ashamed of themselves too!
Was sagt er?
 Bitte sehr!
von Ritter!
von Schonborn!
 - er - Fitzroy -
Kann ich mit Ihnen Deutsch sprechen?
 Ich kann nicht - very sorry - no!]] [Natrlich.]
 [[I speak a very little English.]] [Being on British territory, shall we speak English?]
[[Oh, good!]] [Right ho.] How can I help you, gentlemen? Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
We wish some information about a compatriot of yours in Berlin - [[called]][a certain]--  --Candy.
 Clive Candy?
 Yes. Clive Candy.
 You've come to the right man! I know him well, we were at [[school]] [Harrow] together.
Indeed?
Of course we lost touch a bit since the War. He's Army, you know.
He is an officer of the British Army?
Yes. He's just come back from South Africa.
 This is excellent news.  Ausgezeichnet! Er ist ein Offizier!
 Grossartig!
 You have relieved us from great doubts.
I don't quite understand...
We were worried that your friend might not be able to give satisfaction.
Satisfaction?
It is understood that an officer of the Imperial German Army cannot demand satisfaction from an opponent who is not his equal in position and honour. But since this Clive Candy is a British officer, he can be challenged.
 Challenged to what?
To duel, Mr Fitzroy!
Duel!
Interior: British Embassy, Berlin
Yenning!  Hurry over to the Kaiserhof! Bring Mr Clive Candy here at once! Don't come back without him!  Now hurry!
Ye-yes, Mr Fitzroy.
I told you to HURRY, Yenning! Now don't argue, GO AT ONCE!
Interior: British Embassy, Berlin
Come in, gentlemen.  This is Clive Candy recently arrived from England. I gather from your expressions that you are anxious to meet him.
 [[The Second regiment of Ulans of the Guard are also anxious to have that privilege, sir.]] Mr Candy has insulted the whole German Army!
 I didn't insult anybody, sir. I only said that if Army officers were in the Alldeutscher Verband with Kaunitz--
--then the German Army ought to be ashamed of itself! Exactly!  Eighty-two Ulan officers want to challenge him.
 Lieutenant Candy has told me the whole story.  By the way, the girl you mentioned, is she trustworthy?
[[Unquestionably]] [Undoubtedly], sir.
 Major Goodhead, surely it's not suggested that Lieutenant Candy should fight the whole Officers Corps?
 They are drawing lots, sir, to decide who is to have the honour of fighting this gentleman--  --who has not insulted anybody!
I see. Have you any suggestions, Major?
 Militarily speaking, Mr Candy has no option. He cannot fight a duel. He must run away!
 And politically speaking, such an action would be disastrous. Mr Candy must fight!
Gentlemen! One moment!  Surely you are leaving Lieutenant Candy out of your calculations?
I'll fight if necessary, sir.
My dear boy, I know that.  You had better go to your hotel now and stay there. Oh, and can you get in touch with Miss - ?
Hunter, sir? [[I think I can.]][I believe I could.]
Explain to her that it is necessary to give the impression that your reason for coming to Berlin was to see her. You are probably in love with her, or something of the sort.
Oh, but I say, sir, I'm not!
My dear Lieutenant, you have caused enough trouble already. Do what I ask. Meanwhile I and these gentlemen will discuss the best way to get you out of this.  And us!
 Well. You are a...]
Interior: British Embassy, Berlin
 May I have the Codex, Herr Rittmeister?] This is our famous 'Brown Codex', Major Goodhead, the 'Code of Honour' observed by all duellists. We thought you might not be familiar with it.
 Thank you. I shall study it with attention.
We have permission to offer for the site of the duel the gymnasium at the barracks of our Regiment.
 We agree.
We are now in a position to announce the name of our fellow officer, who will fight Lieutenant Candy: Oberleutnant Theodor Kretschmar- Schuldorff.
May I make a note of that?
With the greatest pleasure.
Here is his card. 
Have you gentlemen any suggestions regarding choice of Leader for the Duel?
 We suggest the Military Attach [[of]] [to] the Swedish [[Embassy]] [legation].
We agree. His name?
Colonel Borg.
 Colonel Borg.
Regarding sabres, we shall, of course, supply a number to choose from.
With your permission, we shall supply a number as well.
Certainly. The choice of sabres will be determined by lot...
 Good.
You know, of course, that the sabre must not exceed the maximum weight of 60 Dekagrammes!
 We shall make a note of it. 
You will bring your own doctor, of course -
And we shall bring ours.
 We agree.
Do you prefer to strip the upper part of the body of the combatants or do you prefer them in shirt sleeves?
 Shirtsleeves. (He points to passage in book.) I see here that Paragraph 133 says: 'It is advisable a few hours previous to the duel, to take a bath!'
Only the principals. Not the seconds. 
It is a very strange sensation to be preparing a duel between two people who have never even seen each other.
 It happens sometimes. Marriages also!  By the way, has your man ever fought a duel?
No. Has yours?
Between ourselves, Theo does not really approve of duels.
 Then gentlemen - is this fight really necessary?
 Sir. There are in a soldier's life moments when his personal feelings do not count. Oberleutnant Kretschmar- Schuldorff knows his duty very well.
We have not agreed the time, gentlemen.
[[Is]] [Will] seven o'clock in the morning [be] agreeable to you?
Get it over early.
 [We agree] Seven o'clock.
It would be advisable to meet half an hour earlier.
At 6.30 a.m. in the gymnasium, at the barracks of the Second Ulans.
The 'Code of Honour' prescribes that the watches of the Seconds should be synchronized by the town clock.  It is now three o'clock precisely!
Here comes our man.]
Morning!  Slept well?
 Very.
He was still sleeping when I called for him at the hotel.
They forgot to wake me.
Your nerves are all right, my boy.
Dr Crowther - [[Lieutenant]] [Mr] Candy.
How d'ye do?
 Why wasn't I allowed any breakfast?
 Because the book says not.
It would.
All right! You'll do.
I hope you have read it?
Miss Hunter read it. She says it's a joke good enough for Punch!  Where is Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff?
He hasn't shown up yet.
I congratulate you on your pronunciation of his name.
I learnt it by heart. So that when my grandchildren ask: 'Grandpa! Have you ever cut anybody's ear off?' I shall be able to answer: 'Yes - Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff's.' Nobody could invent a name like that. Who's this?
Colonel Borg, the Swedish Military Attach. He is going to lead the combat.  Colonel Borg - [[Lieutenant]] [Mr] Candy.
 I must of course use German expressions. I shall say 'Los!'  for starting and 'Halt' for stop. Can you memorize these two words?
I'll try, sir. Anyway at the beginning I'll be pretty sure you mean 'Start'! And, during the combat you're not likely to say 'Start' again!
 That is true. Excuse me. (He bows again and goes.)
Seven o'clock. (Looks towards entrance.) Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff will forfeit his entrance fee if he isn't-- 
I wish I'd brought my uniform!
 How are you with a sabre?
[Oh, I don't know.] I know which end to hold.
We drew lots for each weapon.
I hope mine is a nice light one.
All sabres weigh the same.
Excuse me, please. [Would you undo your shirt?]
Right! (He points to Clive's right arm.) Do you want to roll up your sleeve or rip it off?
What's better?
I am not permitted to give advice.
I think I'll rip it.
 It is definitely better.
Doctor! Your scissors, please!
 What did he hope to find there? (He means inside his shirt.)
 Protective bandages.
 Now you, alone, will come with me, please.
Good luck.
 Ich werde jetzt das Protokol vorlesen - I shall read now the Protocol.  A)  Sie drfen den Kampf nur auf das Commando 'Los' beginnen  You will start only at the command 'Los!'  B) Sie mssen den Kampf auf das von wem immer gegeben Commando 'Halt' unterbrechen - You must stop the combat if you hear the command 'Halt' whoever may say it.  C)  Sobald Sie sich verwundet fhlen, Sie haben den Kampf sofort einzustellen und durch zuriickspringen die Distanz anzunehmen, auch wenn nicht 'Halt' commandiert wird - If you feel to be wounded you must stop the combat and by leaping back you must regain position at the original distance even if no 'Halt' has been commanded.  D) Es ist verboten, die Waffe des Gegners mit der freien Hand zu ergreifen - It is forbidden to seize the weapon of the opponent with the bare hand.
Secundanten, bitte!
Fechtstellung einnehmen! - 'Into fighting-position, please!
Los!
 They must have started by now.
 You never know. I heard of one chap whose nerve broke - absolutely went all to pieces -
 Poor fellow.
 He was in such a funk - this chap - that he couldn't even lift his arm. His Seconds tried to lift it for him but as soon as they let go down it dropped like a railroad signal. Rum! (He ruminates for a moment: EDITH glances at him with distaste.) I say, I hope our chap doesn't get killed, it'll create an awful stink if he does.
 Mr Fitzroy! [I think] you are the most odious man I have ever met! And if anything happens to him I - I will blow up [[the]] [your] Embassy!
I say!  [[D'you know, I really believe you would!]] Are you [[an anarachist ] [a suffragette] Miss Hunter?
[[Not yet!]] [Never mind!] But if anything should happen to Mr Candy -
 Oh! You mean Suggie!  I was talking about the German fellow. Why, Sugar Candy won the Shield at school two years running. Nothing can happen to him. Old Suggie's never - (He suddenly stops speaking.)
 ... Oh! [Look]...
You can go in now, Miss Hunter.
How is he?
The doctor says six to eight weeks, not more.
I'm so glad.
Permission has been granted for you to stay here in the building.
 Oh, but I am not staying in Germany, [[Major]] [Colonel] Goodhead. I go home tomorrow. I have already telegraphed my father.
 Haven't you told her?
 ... No...
Now you must be sensible, Miss Hunter. We are very fortunate that everything has [[turned out as it has]] [gone off so well]. Do you want to spoil everything?  The duel was generally supposed to be about you. What would people think if you left him now, wounded and alone in a Nursing Home? [Naturally] I thought that you understood all this, otherwise why have you come here?
To say goodbye to Mr Candy.
 Go in now, Miss Hunter. By the way, don't bother about the bill.  They have orders to send it to the Embassy. Good morning.
Good morning, Miss Hunter.
 Good morning.  Well! (They go off.
Bitte.]
Guten Tag, Fraulein.
 Good afternoon, miss, you are Miss Hunter, are you not?  My name is Erna Konig and I speak really excellent English.
Oh, that's splendid. (Looks at CLIVE.  His eyes smile and he waves.  She smiles. To NURSE) How is he? 
 He cannot hear or speak. It will be difficult for a few days until we remove the bandage. He has a fine cut, the upper lip is almost severed. Really it is almost 10 centimetres in length, a knife could not have done it better. Do let me take your coat, Miss Hunter!
 Is he in pain?
Yes. Certainly. He is a lucky man that there are no glass splinters in the wound.
Glass splinters? Oh! Yes.
It is a common accident in our winter.
 It must be.
The snow freezes on the boot, the warm room melts the ice, the little piece of slippery ice lies in wait for the hurrying foot and - PFAFF!
But to fall right through the glass window of the British Ambassador. Ah! That is not so common!
 No. Indeed.
And would you believe, there is another accident in the other wing! An officer! He has cut himself to the forehead. Twelve stitches!
It is quite a coincidence.
I go now to tell the Head Nurse that you have arrived. I am ordered to prepare your room.  You are staying here, don't you?
Yes, Nurse Konig, I do.
If you talk to him, please to shout. (She goes but turns at the door, beams reassuringly.) I come back.
 I have got you into [[a nice]] [an awful] mess!  Awful mess.]
[[And you have]] [You've] got me into a [[nice]] mess too!
[I forgive you.] Do you want me to write to your people in England?
[[To your]] parents?
Brother - sister?
 Fiancee?
[Oh, you want] Your wallet?
[Oh, your Aunt.] What is the address?
Your Aunt seems to like short letters. What shall I [tell her] [[write]]? The truth?
Accident?
 Hunting accident?
Do you know that Oberleutnant Kretschmar-Schuldorff is here?
He has a [very] bad cut on his forehead.
[He has] Twelve stitches!
Here is refreshment, Miss Hunter. Then you must depart for today.
When can he have visitors?
Wednesday is Visitors'Day, Miss Hunter.
Every Wednesday?
Every Wednesday from 3 till 5 p.m. At five o'clock a bell is rung for the end of visiting hours. [[Will Mr Candy have many visitors besides yourself, Miss Hunter?
I suspect, quite a number. 
Ulanen! [Wunderbar!]
Das sind ja Auslander! 
Wir miissen gehen, Elizabeth! ('We must go, Elizabeth!')
 Bitte sehr, dahin.
Bitte sehr.]
Was konnen sie bloss sein? 
Keine Ahnung. 
Englander. 
Danke [[sehr]] [Fraulein]!
I thought nobody can smoke more than a German officer. Now I see a British officer can surpass him.
 And not only in smoking, my dear Nurse Konig!
 And in what else also?
Eating - drinking - making love - growing moustaches -  Miss Hunter! I'm going to grow a moustache!  What is your opinion?
Excellent! [[The Colonel]] [Our dragoons] gave you the idea!
 You always find me out!
I saw [[him]] [them] cross the vestibule, preceded by [[his]] [their] moustaches. [[Your supporters]] [They] nearly caused a diplomatic incident at the door, they collided with a party of Ulans coming from - (She points up the corridor.)
 My dear Miss Hunter, soldiers cause military incidents, they leave diplomacy to the diplomats!
Really?
A German man would shave off his moustache to show he had a scar!
That's just one of the points where we differ, my dear Nurse [[Konig]] [Erna].
 Shall you like me with a moustache, Miss Hunter?
How do you know you can grow one?
Nurse [[Konig]] [Erna]! [[Konig]] [Erna]!  Is it allowed to insult the patients?
What view, if any, do you take of my great moustache plan?
 You are of the moustache-type.
 Thank you.
Is the British Army enjoying itself in Berlin?
On the whole  yes. They had lunch yesterday in the Regimental Mess of the First Dragoon Guards. The Kaiser spoke - and the Prince of Wales spoke
[[What did they say?]] [Spoke about what?]
Nobody could remember.
When do they return to London?
In a week. Would you care to accompany them?
They will have a special train, surely?
We could always try.  Or-you could [[wait]] [stay] another five weeks and go back with me. Great care must be taken of me.
No doubt.
No answer at all. Will you or won't you?  If you stay on, you may get another job.
We'll see.]
Oh, are we going to play cards?]
I asked Nurse Erna to fix up a bridge- four. [[I]] [We] don't want [[you]] to get bored.
The Head Nurse is finding a suitable couple for you to play with [after dinner]. But you must not sit up after 10.30 at the very latest.
I promise you, Nurse Erna.
 [[Do you play auction?]] [You do play?]
[[I am afraid not.]] Only whist.
It's simple.  [[Come on.]] Let's play a trial game of double-dummy.
I will bring a lamp.]
You're a good pupil, Edith.
 Game - and rubber! (More figures. That makes 32,000 I owe you. [Toss you.] Double or quits!
Agreed.
Well! Which is it?
Heads - no, I mean TAILS!
 Heads it is! We're quits!
[[There are]] [The] cigarettes [are] here but please remember that smoking is bad for you, Mr Candy.
 Ich liebe Sie, Nurse Erna!
You are an angel, Nurse Erna.
 Good night.
Here come our bridge-players.  [[Please]] [Would you] let them in.
 Oberleutnant Kretschmar-Schuldorff - Miss Hunter - Mr Candy - Frau von Kalteneck. Ich hoffe Sie werden sich amusieren! ('I hope you will enjoy yourselves.')
How do you do?
How d'you do?
Kretschmar-Schuldorff!
 Yes, I know!
 Ich hoi' Sie ab um zehn. ('I will call for you at ten.')
I'm very glad you've come.
Very much.
Very much.
Very much.
Miss Hunter speaks German.  She sprecken German!
 Wirklich? 
Nichtsehr gut. 
 Ich finde, ausgezeichnet! 
Viktoria Kreuz.
Victoria Cross.
 And mostly wrongly.
Let's have a drink!  Sherry?
 Do you like sherry?
Not very much.
Port?
 Miss Hunter?
She and I, we drink Kirchwater. (He means Kirschwasser and shows the bottle.)
 Kirschwasser.
Yes - Kirchwater. Do you like it?
Very much.
The Hotel Kaiserhof, the British Embassy, the Cafe Hohenzollern, and the gymnasium of the barracks of the Second Ulans!
I prefer riding; hunting or polo.
Danke Bestens.  Haben Sie Sport gerne, gnadiges Fraulein? 
 Ich bin nicht talented fur Sports.
 Prosit!
[[Draw]] [Cut] for partners!
 Sie und ich. THEO: Grossartig!  Ich hoffe wir spielen jeden Abend. ('I hope we shall play every night.')
What's he say?
Very much.]
[[Excuse me, sir, I-]] [I say ...]
[[Ah, Mr Fitzroy, I was just about to summon you. Come in.]] [Oh, Baby- Face, I want you a moment.]
 [[Yes, sir.]] [What is it?  Those nursing home accounts?]
[Yes.] Will you kindly explain [[,Mr Fitzroy,]] what the deuce this item means? Forty[[-two]] packs of playing cards!! It's enough for the Casino at Monte Carlo!
[[Yes, sir]] [I know]. I spoke to Miss Hunter - she says [[the evenings were so long - ]] there's nothing [[much]] [else] to do at Stolpchensee in winter -
 Very well.
[[Well, Fitzroy, what's all this?]] [Don't you ever do any work?]
[[Tennis, sir.]] First time this year- if you can spare me, sir.
Hm! Well, don't catch cold!  These nursing homes are an expensive business. Is Miss Hunter returning to England?
As far as I know, sir.
But not at our expense, I hope?
[[Oh,]] [Good heavens] no, sir. She was going anyway [[you remember]].
 Well, so was Candy for that matter! Eh?
Yes, sir, he had a return ticket but it's expired.
 Very well. Buy him a new one.
Mr Fitzroy!
Sir?]]
[[Have]] [And get] Candy [to] give you that [[time-expired]] [old] ticket. We'll [[try and]] claim a refund [[from]] [at] Cooks.
Half a mo'! Those belong to Theo. Put them with the alarm-clock.  How's your own packing going? 
 Not far.
Well, you'd better hurry up then.
 I'll be all right.
Don't be so sure. We've only got half an hour if we are going to call at the Embassy first. I can manage here. Come on, stop mooning about!
 I'm not mooning about!
Keep your hair on!  I say, old girl, what's up?
Edith! I say - Edith! What's the matter? It's not because I didn't call for you yesterday, is it? You know  Frau von Kalteneck left last night for the South.
 Did she?
But you knew she was going!
I'd forgotten...
I can't help it if you don't like horses, can I?  We went to see her racing-stables - she has some fine [[horses]] [beasts] but they're too fat. Edith! do stop crying! Suppose somebody comes in.
 Nobody will come in...
Look!  I promise to take you out the first night we're back in London! [[We'll go to]] 'Her Majesty's' [Theatre] - 'The Last of the Dandies' - they say it's [an] awfully good [show].
 - I saw - the paper said -
What paper? What do you mean? Is that what's making you cry?
 - the paper said - there's a new play at 'Her Majesty's Theatre' - called 'Ulysses' - !
 Oberleutnant Kretschmar-Schuldorff returns your books, Mr Candy. He is on his way to see you.
 I must hurry!
You'd better! We'll meet in the hall!
Yes. 
What am I going to do with them? I don't read German.  Miss Hunter got them for me.
You can present them to our library.
Clever Nurse Erna. (The [[Brunhilde]] [Mignon] Aria is whistled outside.) So Clive Candy's name will always live in a corner at Stolpchensee!  But I must write my name in them.  Hullo, Theo!
 Kann ich come in?
Certainly, [come in] my old horse. (As THEO climbs through.) My old steeplechaser!
Wo ist Edith?
Packing.
 Packing?
Well, of course! Und Sie? How much longer Sie?
Eine week  or two. (Makes sign with fingers.) Clive!
Eh?
Edith come here! Translate for us!
I can translate -
 Nicht das! Very important.
Shall I fetch Miss Hunter?
Now look here, don't disturb her, she'll never be ready!  Ich mussen call at Embassy, old man - get my ticket nach London.
 [Ja.] Please!
Drink?
[Nein.] Not now.
All right. What the blazes is up with everybody?
 Clive! You and I friends. Yes or no?
Of course we're friends!
[[Very sorry, but you and I]] [We] must duel again!
 Where's your dictionary, old chap? You must have got two pages stuck together!
 I  love - your - (He tries to find the word 'fiancee' but can't.) Teufel! Your - Miss Hunter
 Say that again!
I - love - your - Miss Hunter!
You're cuckoo!
 [[No]] [No, ich nein 'cuckoo'], you 'cuckoo'! Because Miss Hunter love me!
Congratulations!  When did it happen? Why don't I know about it?
 No duel?
Duel? I-  Ich!  Fight anyone who tries, to stop it! Now will you have a drink?
Double drink!
 But you know, old man, Edith was never my fiancee.
Fiancee! The word I not find!
 Not my fiancee! (  Lovely girl! Sweet girl!  But not my fiancee!
[[ So?]] [Bottoms up!]
Have a drink, Nurse Konig! Where's the fiancee?
She can't come down -
Then we go up. Come on, Theo!
Edith!
Come in.]
Edith, my child! I feel like a proud father!
 Do you, Clive?  Why?
I have to give you away, don't I?
How did you find out?
Theo told me in fluent Double Dutch.
 I told.  Das einzige Wott ich konnte nicht finden war 'fiancee'.
A toast! This to the happiness of my fiancee who was never my fiancee and of the man who tried to kill me before he was introduced to me.  Prosit!
 May I kiss the bride?
Why ask? I have [did] not ask!
 Goodbye, Clive.
Goodbye, Edith - old girl. I hope we'll meet again sometime -
I'm sure we shall -
Now look here, you son of a gun! You won't understand a word of what I'm going to say - but I came to Berlin to find a rat and found two of the grandest people I ever met. [[I'm a little bit drunk.]] I leave to you, you Prussian stiff-neck, this girl in trust; and if you don't take care of her I'll raise the whole of England against you! The Navy will steam up your stinking Stolpchensee!  I shall lead the Army down Unter den Linden! and we'll -
 Stop! Kamerad!]]
 [Clive,] my English is not very much. But my friendship for you is very much.
And I'm sorry that I have to refuse your invitation to go to'Her Majesty's Theatre'.]]
I hope it's taught you a damn good lesson, Candy.
Trouble with you young fellows is you always want to go changing everything. And what's the result? You spend all your leave in a nursing home full of foreigners. You cost the Treasury a lot of money. You make the Foreign Office very cross, yes very cross. And what do you get for it?  Your beauty's spoilt. You weren't any fashion plate before. I'd be surprised if any woman would look twice at you now.
So would I, sir.
When you were here in January, I told you very clearly it was not your concern. It was an Embassy job.
Well, sir, I suppose I thought I'd take a chance.
A chance? A chance?  You can't afford to take a chance with your career, my boy. You are in the Army as a career, aren't you, not for five minutes? You were putting up a pretty good show. You go barging in on this nonsense and you come pretty near to getting yourself kicked out. You don't want to get yourself kicked out, do you?
No, sir.
Well, let me tell you one thing. Don't bother your head with things you don't understand and you won't go far wrong. Don't go off at half- cock. Keep cool. Keep your mouth shut. And avoid politicians like the plague. That's the way to get on in the Army.
Thank you, sir.
 Care to dine at my club tonight?
Sorry, sir, I'm taking someone to the theatre.
Pretty?
I haven't met her yet, sir.
You're still a bit cracked, my boy. Well, I hope you improve as you get older. And cheer up, my boy.
Yes, sir.
Father, whose oath in hollow Hell is heard; Whose act is lightning after thunder-word; A boon! a boon! - that I compassion find For one, the most unhappy of mankind.
How is he named?
Ulysses. He who planned To take the towered city of Troy-land.
What wouldst thou?
This! That he at the last may view the smoke of his own fire c ruling blue.
Where bides the man?
Calypso this long while Detains him in her languorous ocean-isle.
Father of gods, this man has stricken blind my dear son Polyphemus, and with wind, With roaring waves, by me let him be hurled From sea to sea and dashed about the world.
Peace, children, and from your shrill reviling cease!  Hermes, command Calypso to release Ulysses and to waft him over seas.  Ulysses shall return.
Cloud-gatherer, stay!
Yet canst you work in mischief on the way   , Yet ere he touch at last his native shore, Ulysses must abide one labour more.
 Where's the bar?
Darling, do control yourself.
I say, there's old Suggie.
Really, darling?  Where?
Suggie ... Suggie ... Suggie. (Getting louder, until he attracts a scowl from one of the actors.)
 Who is the girl with Clive, darling? Do you know her?
 As a matter of fact I do.
Well, darling [who is she]?
 I believe he met her sister in Berlin -
Darling, why all this mystery? Who is she?
My niece's governess - a Miss Hunter.
 [[What is the world coming to?]] [Wonders will never cease.]
What, Lieutenant Candy?]]
 Sybil Gilpin out without her mother! [And with Hoppy too.]
Oh, didn't you know [,Mr Candy]? They are married!
Hoppy! Sybil!
Over a month [ago. The family were quite taken by surprise. It was very romantic and sudden. They met here in this very theatre.]
[[And to think that I sent Hoppy to take my place - ]] [I know,] I seem to be a born matchmaker.
[[Good evening]] [Hello], Pebble!
Master Clive!
Your Aunt is asleep.
[[Never mind, Pebble. Don't wake her.]] [All right, don't disturb her.] I didn't feel like going to the Club tonight.
You're not sick, Master Clive?
I say, Pebble, how did you feel when you buried Mr Pebble?
It wasn't so bad at the time, Master Clive, there was so much to do. It was after that it got bad, if you understand me.  I hope you haven't come from a burying, sir.
No. From the theatre. But it was the same thing, in a way.
Was it a sad play?
On the contrary. It was a musical play. Is the bed in my Den made up?
No, sir, but it won't take a minute if you don't mind sleeping in blankets. There isn't time to air the sheets. Lady Margaret has made some changes, Master Clive, you'll see when
Pebble! What is going on there?
Nothing, Lady Margaret.
You're a liar, Pebble!
Clive!  How dare you come waking up the whole neighbourhood at this hour of the night. Go to your club!
All right. I'm going.
Did you hear me, nephew? Go to your club!
Very well. Let's go!
 Put me down, you fool!
And I can stay?
I suppose so, since there's no man here to throw you out.
How are you, Aunt Margaret?
You may give me a kiss.
Am I staying?
I suppose so, since there's no man here to throw you out.]
I say? Who put up my South African heads?
I've no idea.
They don't look half bad, do they?
No. [Pebble, do stop fussing like an old hen and go to your bed.
Good night, Master Clive.
Good night.
[Now,] Even money that some catastrophe has brought you here!
You're on.
Debts?
No.
A woman?
Not exactly.
Explain!
I went to the theatre tonight.
Alone?
With a girl.
And pray why is she 'not exactly'?
Oh, it's nothing to do with her.
Perhaps. [[Who was there?]] See anyone you know?]
I saw Hoppy with Sybil Gilpin. They're married!
Certainly. A very suitable match. He has money, she has land. [And neither of them has any brains.] You weren't in love with her, surely?
With Sybil? Oh, no.
I am glad [of that]. She has muscles like a prizefighter and she[['s bound to]] ['11] hit Hoppy one day. [[Come along! I want to show you your Den.]]
 Hoppy could give her a couple of stone.
She will soon make that up, I assure you! Who is this girl you took to the theatre?
A Miss Hunter. I met her sister in Berlin.
Is she nice?
Very. I mean the sister.
Which sister?
The one that stayed in Berlin.
 [Then] the one in London is not so nice, I take it?
 No.
 Now [[look here]] [listen], Clive. I have eighteen rooms here, a bone- idle staff eating their heads off, and when you come home from South Africa, you go straight to your Club.
I know. It's awful.
[[I had the walls cleared for your heads. Now,]] I want you to remember: wherever you go - whatever you do you've [always] got a home here! And - whatever you shoot  there's [always] room here for them. Look how much room there is!
This is Dead Cow Cross-roads, sir.
 The question is: whether that is the Church with the double tower, or the 'Estaminet du Pont'?
Damn it, Murdoch, you're supposed to know the road!
I know it at night, sir. In the daytime it looks different.
Eh? Got a scent?
Yes, sir.  That's our road. I can smell the two Jerries the Sappers planted.
For'ard then!
Harkaway, sir!
Glad to see you, sir. I've got another umbrella for you.
You've a marvellous eye for loot, Van Zijl.
Learnt from the English in the Boer War, sir.
 Where d'you get 'em?
Off Jerrieseleven of them-brought in an hour ago.  Lord knows where they stole them, they were using them for camouflage against aircraft.
 Good evening.
Can we get through to the R.T.O. in Dupuis-sur-something?
Dupuis-sur-Crois. The Yanks are down there. How about it, Paddy?
'Fraid the lines broke between us and 'Mile 14', sir. We can send a runner.
What message, sir?
Tell him to hold a place on the leave- train. When can I leave here?
Not before dark. They're plastering the road between 17 and 19 with shrapnel.
Right. Will someone look after Murdoch?
Nobby! Paddy, get that runner away!
Yes, sir.
If any of you have got an important letter or message home, I'll take it.
Thank you, sir!
Paddy! I'll [[tackle]] [see] the prisoners again presently.
What are these prisoners?
Ulans. The Second Regiment. That's all I've got out of them so far.
The Second Regiment of Ulans? I'd like to question them.
 Certainly, sir. (Goes to passage, yells.) Paddy!  Bring in the prisoners.
Yes, sir.
Any officer with them?
No such luck.
Where did you nab them?
Floating down the river early this morning. I had a boom across and netted them like salmon. They had a hundred pounds of dynamite with 'em. My guess is they were after the new pontoon-bridge below St Mangy.
How the blazes did they get to know about that?
They took one of our patrols prisoner day before yesterday.
 Are you suggesting our fellows talked?
The Germans know how to make them talk.
 [Well if they are,] They're cracking, my dear chap. It's a sure sign. Nobody starts to fight foul until he sees he can't win any other way. I quite believe Hindenburg, who I hear said the other day that until now ' Germany has used her arms with honour -  I admit he said nothing about her legs.
This bears you out, sir.
What?
It was on one of the prisoners.
Let me see it.
It's in German.
Oh! Well, read it.]]
It's an appeal from the 'Erster General Quartier-Meister', from old man Ludendorff himself, to his loyal troops. It starts: 'Soldiers, stand fast or Germany will lie in the dust. Should the enemy discover that our Mannzucht - (He searches for the word) Our morale is broken, all is lost, you will have fought and suffered in vain and the Homeland will hear the tramp of the invader.' What do you think of that, sir?
 What else?
 'Have you heard the British say that Germany has fallen? Is this to be? Nein und abermals nein!  Thus far they have seen only German faces, shall they now see only our backs? Stand, or the Fatherland is doomed and you with her!'
 There's a rumour that the Kaiser abdicated yesterday.
Again, sir?
Do any of you know Oberst Kretschmar- Schuldorff?
Don't play deaf! He was an Oberst in your Regiment the last time I heard of him - Oberst Kretschmar-Schuldorff, Second Regiment of Ulans!
Which of you can speak English?
You! You spoke English an hour ago! Answer the General!
I do speak.
Ah! Now [[I want to tell you something]] [listen to me]. We don't use the same methods that I hear you use on your prisoners. But I assure you that we have means to get what we want.  What was this explosive found on you intended for?
I don't know.
 Don't lie!
I don't know.
You took three of our men prisoner two days ago.
No.
Then how did you know about the bridge?
I know nothing about a bridge...
 Then why were you carrying dynamite?
All right to go now, sir. Your car's waiting.
Won't you stay for dinner, sir?
What have you got?
Macaroni. We found it in the cellar.
Beastly stuff!
And the usual corned-horse.
Thanks. I'll take my chance in Dupuis. Pity I've got to go. I'd like another [[try]] [shot] at those prisoners.
 I've got the idea, sir. I'll tackle them for you.
Right! Make your report to Brigade.
Very good, sir.]
Dirty night! I prefer Natal to Flanders! Don't you, Van Zijl?
I have seen nights like this on Commando, General, even in Natal.
 Good luck with your new enemy!
Goodbye, sir. Let's hope the show's over by the time you're back.
Not much chance of that.
Do you know the road, driver?
Blindfold, sir.
He only lost his way three times coming here!  Carry on, Murdoch.
Good old Sugar Candy!
Did he get anything out of the prisoners?
Not a sausage.
Shall I lock 'em up again?
Oh, no. Now we put the screws on!
Didn't you this afternoon, sir.
No, my lad. Not with Sugar Candy coming. He has a tender heart. Now, listen! Take four men ...]]
When's the war going to end, Jerry?
Who knows?
EMPTY_LINE
 [Now] Listen! I am in command here now and I know how to deal with you scum. I am not a simple English gentleman but a simple South African and I assure you that I have means to get what I want. ( (His paraphrase is deliberate and he is obviously thinking in the 'taal'.) What was the dynamite for? How many of you got away? What happened to the three men you took prisoners? Thirty seconds to reply! [[  If you do not understand the questions I have a squad of interpreters outside, whom you will understand.
Right!  Cooper!
Sir!
The three men nearest the door. Take them out and shoot them! Lieutenant Casey is in command of the firing squad!
Jump to it!
Yes, sir!  Come on! You three!
 Shall I repeat the questions?
 Thirty seconds! Shall I repeat the questions?
You cannot shoot us - there is an international convention about prisoners!
Oh, you can speak English, too?
Right! The next three, Cooper!
Come on you!
 You can take the tall one. I've found another interpreter.
You there!
I protest!
Protest rejected.
International conventions! You think they are useful on this side of the line, don't you?
Please - Herr Kommandant - I want to speak to the others in German.
Go ahead. You have--  thirty seconds.
There's the signal, sir.
Right and for God's sake don't point at me. Ready?
 Yes, sir.
 FIRE!
I'll bet your pals are talking nineteen to the dozen!
This is against international Law...
Do you want to stand outside in the rain?
No!
Then shut up!
 Sentry!
 SENTRY!  There must be somebody there! Who opened the gate? SENTRY!!
 Every perishing car sticks in the perishing mud, I'm not a perishing service station!
 This is General Candy's car!
11.15. How far are we from Dupuis?
Two kilometres, General
 Now then, Murdoch!  Come on, man, come on! Give us a hand! I don't want to spend the night here!
Taint a bit of use, General. You need a truck to get you out of this -
Don't waste stamina talking nonsense, my boy. Push!
 The ornery son of a gun!
We'd better give up, sir.
 I shall walk to the village. Murdoch, wait here for a truck and then follow me.
 Which way, sentry?
Steer by your nose, General!  Follow the telephone poles until you come to a dead horse. You can't miss it. The road forks, you take the left. Left again at the farm. The Jerries killed all the pigs before they retreated. You won't miss them either. They're ripe as Roquefort. The village lies dead ahead. When you smell chloride of lime, you're there!
Hm!
How shall I find you, sir?
 Ask at the R.T.O.'s office!]]
8.35, 8.35 ... Hello, hello... Dammit.  Lousy line is dead, sir. I can't get Beechwood.
Keep trying. (To CLIVE, not recognizing his rank]) Yeah, and what do you want?
I am Brigadier-General Candy.
I'm sorry, sir. Sit down, take a load off your feet. I couldn't see your brass for the mud. What can I do for you?
Are you a Railway Transport Officer?
I run trains, if that's what you mean. That is when there are any trains to run.]
Did you get my chit?
[[Chit, sir?]]  Jake, will you for the Lord's sake get me through to Beechwood. The General's having kittens. Try the other circuit. You said chit?
Yes.
What's a chit?]
[A] message, man, [a] message! [I want transport to London. It's urgent.]
Sit down, sir?
Thanks. (He shows his papers.]]
[[I've been on duty since eleven. No chit came in, General.]] [Hasn't been any message through here since I've been on duty. See what we can do for you.]
Well - never mind. I've got a spot of leave. Going to London. Want to touch Paris.]]
Jake, get R.T.O. at Ami-le-Bon, will you?
OK, sir.]
 [[This is R.T.O. Dupuis-sur-Crois. Get me R.T.O. at Ami-le-Bon.]] [Yes, yes, we're trying to get through, sir. We're trying the other circuit right now. Yes, I'll let you know.  A merry little madhouse we've got here, isn't it?]
[Yes, very.] When does my train leave? [[When do I get to Paris?]] Where do I change? And where can I get some food?
 I thought so. Thanks very much.] [[Just hang on ... I'm getting]] [Yeah, it's just what I thought, sir, you'll have to get] through to Ami-le-Bon.
 [[Ami-le-Bon!
The highway's OK, sir. Let me show you the route. You turn right at Dead Pigs Farm - (To telephone What? Well, check it!  The line is broken between 'Mile 14' and the Estaminet du Pont.
Thank you, I know that. Now look here, my boy - I've been to that blasted Estaminet- ]] I've come from Ami-le-Bon to catch a train here! [My motorcar is stuck ...]
 [[Well, General, that's rich.]]  What's that? What General? The hell you say? Well, that's that.]
I'm glad you think so.]]
We're in the same boat, General. I've come four thousand miles from Pittsburgh to Dupuis-sur-Crois. I checked in yesterday and the war finishes tomorrow.
What do you mean?
Haven't you heard the news?]]
[[What news?]] [What's what?]
A German delegation is on the way to see Foch. [They're going] To sue for an Armistice.
YIPEE!]
[[Old trick]] [Nonsense]. German propaganda. [Old trick to] Put us off our guard.
Maybe. But I came here 'Express' and I have a hunch I'm going back 'Slow Delivery'.]]
[[Well, what about trains?]] [What about my train?]
[There's] Not a train, a truck, an engine or a driver, General.
 In this war I've seen ammunition dumps without ammunition, field- kitchens without cooks and railway stations without rails, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised at anything.  But let me tell you, young man, that in the Boer War or in Somaliland this sort of inefficiency would not have been tolerated for a second! Not for a second!  Now where can I get some grub?
 Grub, sir?
Food, man, food.]]
The 'Crown of Thorns' is [[always]] good for a hand-out at [almost] any hour, sir.
What is it? A pub?
A - ? 
A-a-dash it, I don't speak your language, sir - a cafe?
[No, sir.] It's a convent[[, sir]]. [It's on the way to Ami-le-Bon.]
[[Good. Well,]] show me the way, will you [[- what's your name - er - Lieutenant]]?
Schmidt. Ensign Schmidt, sir.
 Yes, sir. I've got cousins in Westphalia. My father told me to give 'em hell if I met up with them. This way, sir.]]
: I think I hear Armstrong coming with the bathtub now.] (The two men step out into the darkness. [[(The two waiting soldiers are left alone.
The General's right - I was in the Boer War and in Somaliland. I remember -
Garn!  Them wasn't wars - them was fatigues!]]
Armstrong, I want you to take the General over to the Crown of Thorns.
Yes sir. Yes sir, General. I sure will do that. It's kind of damp underfoot, but I'll get you there, General.
Climb aboard, sir. You're off.
Poor show I couldn't get a train tonight.
You can step on it, Armstrong. The General's in a hurry.
Sure will do that.
 Goodbye, General.
What were those other wars the General was talking about, Captain?  The Boer War, the Somy something. I never heard of them.
Those weren't wars. Those were just summer manoeuvres.]
Here we are, General, the Convent of the Crown of Thorns. (Offers to help him out of sidecar.)
I can manage, thank you.
Bonsoir, Sister Josephine.
Bonsoir, Napoleon.
I've brought you a real live English General.
Monsieur.
Ici le Convent, Madame?
Oui, Monsieur. Vous desirez?]]
Je suis [[une Colonel]] [un General] anglais.
Mais entrez, Monsieur!
Goodnight, General. Bonsoir, Sister Josephine.
Bonsoir, Napoleon.
Merci, madame, [[je suis - je suis mange - ]][... les Americains ... j'ai mange ...]
 Monsieur le General a mange quelque chose qui lui aurait fait mal?
Oui-mange -
Mais venez done, mon General.
Bonsoir, Madame.]
Bonsoir, mon General, on va vous soigner.]]
[Good evening,] General, you have fallen on your feet.
 I was beginning to think so.
I have sixty-eight young, freshly- trained nurses straight from England all dying to nurse someone. What's the trouble?
 Trouble, Matron?
The nun said you had eaten something -
She got it wrong - I want to eat. I'm hungry!
Oh! (To MOTHER SUPERIOR and NUN) C'estqu'il veut manger!
It's all right, General, won't you join us? We shall all be delighted.
Thank you.  Merci, ma mere.]]
 Sois bienvenu, [[monfils]] [General.  II va rester avec nous.]
[That's settled then. We should be delighted to have you join us.] Have you been in the front line?  I suppose you have?  Before I got this job I was with the Italians. I was lucky. I came through Caporetto without a scratch.
 Good heavens! What insect powder do you use, Ma'am?
 We have macaroni.
Splendid! (He still can't take his eyes off the girl.)
Matron! Have you ever seen the Indian Rope trick?
 No, General. Have you?
Pardon, Monsieur.
It must be an incredible sight.
But I never [[met]] [heard of] anybody who saw it unless he [[first]] heard [[that]] he was going to see it [first].
I beg your pardon! I don't quite -
You hear about the thing. You hope to see it - and you - see it.
 [Yes, General,] Will you excuse me? [[I have to put my girls to bed. 
 [[Can you - who is that girl, please, Matron? - The one who just got UP - ]] [One moment, Matron, do you know that girl over there?]
[[Do you think you know her?]] I'm afraid [[I can't tell you]] [I don't]. I only met them here at the station. [[I must go, please excuse me.]]  Come along, everybody, come along.
 Come on, Wynne.]
Tell me, who was that girl who was sitting there?]]
Ou est le matron?
La Matrone? A qui vous avez parle? Restez. Je vais la chercher.
 Nurse, do you know the name of the girl who was sitting at the end of that table?]
Whereabouts, General?
 Here. She was sitting here asleep.]]
Darker fair?
Fair.
I don't remember.  Can you describe her better?
She's - fair. I couldn't see the colour of her eyes. [Slim.]
Sorry. It might be anyone. [[I was asleep myself.]] Excuse me, General.
 Where do you come from tonight? What detachment are you?
Yorkshire. West Riding, most of us. Good night, General.
Good morning, General Candy.
Nice day, sir.
Come on, Murdoch, come on!
Yes, sir.
Am-Ile-Bon!
Yes, sir.
 How long now?
 Not long, sir.
You've said that ten separate times.
I know, sir.
Well, hurry! The train leaves at 10.30.
I know, sir.
[[It's 9.30 now.]] I need extra time in Ami-le-Bon. I'm going to G.H.Q.
I know, sir.
[[Don't talk]] [Stop talking] like an infernal parrot, Murdoch. How do you know?
I was told, sir.
Who told you?
Major van Zijl's batman, sir.
What did he say?
That you were up in the air, sir, because the Major had got valuable information from the Jerries - the prisoners, sir.
 Your misinformation, Murdoch, is typical.
Thank you, sir.
The reason I am 'up in the air', as your informant grotesquely describes a very natural emotion, is because this information was obtained by intimidation!  By mental torture! By firing squads!  By the same methods that the Boches use!  If we are fighting gangsters that is no reason why we should behave like gangsters, too.
 Bah! Four pages of 'confessions'! Not worth the -
Hm! Kretschmar-Schuldorff! There can't be two of them with a name like that, eh, Murdoch?
No, sir.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
No, sir.
Haven't I told you about that time I was in Berlin in 1902.?
Oh, yes, sir. When you grew your moustache.
And yet you[['ve never heard]] [can't remember the name] of Kretschmar- Schuldorff. You know, [[Murdoch,]] you should bequeath your brain to Guy's Hospital, [Murdoch].
I remember, sir. He married the girl.
Last night, Murdoch, I saw a girl - a nurse straight from England... I've never seen a more striking resemblance...
She must have been a very common type of girl, sir - the young lady in Berlin, I mean.
She was a most uncommon - what the devil d'you mean, Murdoch?
 There was that girl in the film, sir. You remember, you went nine times. And there was that girl in the group out of the Bystander! We lost it in the big Push. And there's - (Without changing tone) A despatch rider coming, sir!
General Candy?
Yes. 
Urgent message from Major van Zijl, sir. Came over the wire from 'Mile 14'; they mended the line, sir.
Any answer, sir?
No. No answer.
Anything wrong, sir?
Murdoch - the war is over.
Is it, sir?
The Germans have accepted the terms of the Armistice.  Hostilities cease at ten o'clock.  [[It is now a quarter to ten.]] [It's nearly that now.]
 God bless us, sir.
Yes, Murdoch, may God bless us in peace as He has in Victory.
Murdoch! do you know what this means?
I do, sir. Peace. We can go home. Everybody can go home!
For me, Murdoch, it means more than that. It means that Right is Might after all. The Germans have shelled hospitals, bombed open towns, sunk neutral ships, used poison-gas - and we won! Clean fighting, honest soldiering have won! God bless you, Murdoch.
Sir!]
Oh dear.
 Don't listen [to her]!  Now!  [You listen to me.] There I was asleep! You never saw me before - you never [even] spoke to me then - how could you be so sure?
Can I ask you a question first?
You're wriggling! All right, fire away!
How can you be so sure?  I'm twenty years older than you - and I'm a soldier. When other people are thanking God the war is over, I am going to the War Office to ask: Where is another war where you can use me?
 You asked me that once [before] and I told you [[why]].
I'm asking you again because I want to hear it again [and again].
I'm marrying you because I want to join the Army and see the world. I'm marrying you because I [[like seeing]] [love watching] you play polo. I'm marrying you for fifty reasons that all mean that's how I imagined my future husband!
Same here! That's how I imagined my future wife!
The gong is the final appeal. We must go, darling. We have the Bishop for lunch.
I hope he's tender.
... and now [[let me]] [in conclusion, I should like to] say a few words to Brigadier-General Andy. We in the Church Militant can admire the heroes of the war. But in our hearts we are men of peace. Therefore, I am glad to have met you as I did for the first time on a simple and heart- warming occasion [[and not]] [rather than] at some military celebration. When I first heard that a Brigadier- General of the British Army was arranging a ball for the benefit of those nurses from the West Riding who took part in the four years' struggle, I said [to myself]: There is a man whose heart is in the right place. (He refers to slip of paper.) And I am glad to announce that one result is that a total of 131.2.6 will be handed over to the War Nurses' Benevolent Fund.
[[Your Grace]] [My Lord Bishop], I want to make a confession. You see, I first saw Barbara in Flanders on the last night of the war. ((He glances at MRS WYNNE.) She was a nurse among seventy other nurses - I never knew her name -but I found out that most of the nurses came from Yorkshire - the West Riding - and of course she was a nurse - [[well]] [so], I thought - Yorkshire's a big place - [[Your Grace]] [My Lord Bishop] - so, I thought, how can I find a nurse in Yorkshire? You - understand who I'm driving at - I suppose - what I mean? -
I understand exactly what you mean, darling!
That window is the Den!
Wrong. Next floor is the Den. That's the bathroom.
Is yon grey head Murdoch?
 His idea of greeting the conquering hero, I suppose.
I shall like Murdoch - and I [[feel]] [know] I shall like this house. Clive, let [[it]] [the whole house] be our Den, into which we can always crawl, whether we return with rich spoils or badly mauled from our rovings! Or just to change our spots! [[Do promise!]]
[[(Looks at her I do.]]  Aunt Margaret would have loved you for that! (They go on talking as idiotic lovers do.)
It is a fine solid-looking property-  Like you. Clive, [[please don't ever]] [you mustn't] change and don't ever [[give up]] [leave] this house.
No fear. Even if there is a second Flood, this house shall stand on its solid foundations and we'll have a private lake in the basement.
That's a promise. You stay just as you are... till the floods come...
 ... till the floods come...
 ... and this is a lake...
 ... and this is a lake!
Sorry, Ma'am! - Mrs Candy - I was [[up]] [at] the top [of the house] - I wasn't expecting you so early, sir.
So you are Murdoch!
Yes, Madam.
The first time I've ever heard him answer anything but: 'Yes, sir!' Well, Murdoch, this is [[my]] [the] wife.
Everything is under control, Ma'am. I've had the telephone installed, sir.  The agency has got a lot of cooks for you to see, Ma'am, but I bought plenty of vegetables and flour and potatoes.  And all the tradespeople have called and will call again for [your orders] -
That's all right, Murdoch, but we're not staying this time. Off tonight.
 Yes, sir?
Paris for eight weeks. When we get back we'll give a big party and put our feet up for a bit.
Yes, sir.
I'm [so] sorry, Murdoch. 
 [[I'm]] [We're] used to it [[Ma'am]].  I got your letters from the Club, sir - they're on the little tray.]]
I told the porter that the Brigadier wouldn't be using the Club so much in future, Ma'am.
And what did he say?
[Go on, Murdoch,] I can bear it, [[Murdoch]].
[[Yes, Ma'am.]] He said: They all say that at first!' - Ma'am.
I say, Barbara - !  Here's an answer from the Prisoners of War Committee -
Have they found him?
 Yes. Theodor Kretschmar- Schuldorff, Oberst, 2nd Regiment of Ulans of the Guard.  That's him! Camp VII Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire. Poor old Theo!
Darling!
Let's postpone Paris... I'd love to meet him -
Message, sir, from the Commandant's office.]
No answer.]
 No [answer]!!
 Well?
He said 'No [answer]'? (He frowns incredulously) What else?
Nothing, sir.
He refused to come?
If that was the message, Ma'am. (He hands the pad TO CLIVE.) (BARBARA reads it, passes it to the Major.
Why is 'very much' [[in quotes]] [printed like that]?
It was a joke we had...
 Where was the Oberst?
Listening to the [[orchestra]] [band], sir.
All right, Higgins.
I [[thought, suddenly]] [was thinking], how odd they are!  How queer!  For years and years they are writing and dreaming wonderful music and [[wonderful]] [beautiful] poetry and then [[suddenly]] [all of a sudden] they start a war, shoot innocent hostages, sink undefended ships, bomb and destroy whole streets in London, killing little children - and then, dressed in the same butcher's uniform, they sit down and [[play]] [listen to] [[Beethoven]] [Mendelssohn] and Schubert.  There's something horrible about that, don't you think so Clive?
Hm - mm - [[something in that - good deal in fact - ]]
Perhaps I should have written in German.
He understands English.  They have all learnt English while they were here.]]
Major Davies, would you mind if I went down and had a try?  Perhaps it was because of the music - there's an interval now.
[[Certainly, you may]] [By all means] try  but Mrs Candy had better [[stay]] [remain].
 Can't understand it.  I've written to him before the war and he has written to me...
They stopped English lessons on the 11th of November.
On Armistice Day?
Oberst Kretschmar-Schuldorff?
 [[Behind you.]] [Over there.]
Theo!
Do you find something rather disturbing about these concerts - or don't you mind?
I'm not musical but I get used to them. This is the 107th.
 You misunderstand me, Major - or do you? (The MAJOR looks at her.) What I mean is that we know that the Germans in peacetime are a tidy law- loving people of poets, philosophers and composers; and then -
Well, it's true. I saw him and he wouldn't speak to me. (He looks at BARBARA and sits down.) I wouldn't have believed it possible. He was as close as I am to you and he turned away without saying a word. You could have knocked me down with a feather! (BARBARA gives him his tea. He stirs it.) I kept on looking back, you know. I couldn't believe he wasn't joking.  What on earth is wrong with him?
The same thing as all the others. They call it 'Ehre'. The literal translation is 'Honour' but actually I suppose it means 'Dignity'.
What 'Dignity', what 'Honour'?  Who has hurt his 'Ehre'? They lost, we won. What of it. We've been defeated too sometimes. Fortune of war!
 Good old sporting spirit. Always time for a return match.
I was taught to be a good loser.  When are they going to be repatriated?
In six to eight weeks.
What will you do then, Major Davies?
Take a holiday, Mrs Candy - where they don't speak German!
If you're passing through London, drop in!
When we're back from Paris, I'm making Clive give a party for his friends. If you can, do come.
Thank you. I'll try. I'd like to talk to you about Germans, both of you. You were going to say something rather interesting just now - something about peacetime and war?]]
Ah, Davies.
Hello, Candy. I hope your wife will forgive me.]
 [[Awfully sorry, old man.]] [I'm afraid] You haven't read the invitation properly.
 Ah, [[so it is,]] a Bachelor Party. If I'd realized that your charming wife wouldn't be here, [[I'd never have hurried as I did]] [I shouldn't have been in such a hurry].
We'll find you something.
Thanks, I had dinner on the train. I've come straight from Victoria.
On leave?
No.  Duty...
Come and have a glass of port.
This is Brigadier-General Candy's residence ...
May I speak to the General?]
And who, may I ask, is speaking?...
This is Oberst Kretschmar-Schuldorff, speaking from Victoria Station. And tell him I'm leaving tonight.]
Would you mind repeating the name, sir...
 Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff.]
Couldn't he 'phone tomorrow? Where's he speaking from?
Victoria Station, sir. He's leaving tonight he said.
What name?
It sounded like Wretch-Bar Something, sir -
Kretschmar-Schuldorff!  Murdoch, that brain of yours ought to be in a bottle!
Theo! [[You old son-of-a-gun! Where are you?...  Victoria? What are you doing there?]]
[Yes, it's me, Theo. How are you my friend? Yes,] I'm going home - if there is such a thing left in Germany. [[How are you, my friend?... Good...]] Oh, there are scores of us here. [Can't you hear them?] We have an extra train, it leaves at 11.3 o.... Yes, we are under guard, Clive! May I still call you Clive, now you are a General?...
Cut the cackle. What have you to say for yourself?]
 Listen! I am sorry! [I'm terribly sorry.] That is what I wanted to tell you. About our meeting at the Camp. I was a silly fool. [I had to tell you before I left.] And now I must ring off...
[[Wait a minute! Don't hang up! It's only a quarter past nine, now, I want to see you... Who says I can't? I've got the G.S.O.I. in charge of all military transport here to dinner, as well as your Camp Commander.]] [Major Davies. Come here a minute, will you?]  I'll send you back to Derbyshire if you're not careful! - Now you just sit tight and we'll come and get you.
All right, all right, I won't run away.]
You've got to come and have a glass of port! You can't leave England without having a glass of my port. Where did you learn that perfect English of yours?]]
Where do you think I learnt it? I had plenty of time ...  Well, all right. I shall not run away.
Lieutenant Cartwright inside?
Yes, sir.
Ask him to step outside, sentry!
 Lieutenant Cartwright, sir!
He's coming, sir.
 At ease, man, at ease!
Sorry to have dragged you out like this, Piggy.
From an excellent glass of port, too!
Ah, Cartwright - this is Major-General Blomfield - Brigadier-General Candy -  We want one of your prisoners, Cartwright. Oberst Kretschmar- Schuldorff is an old friend of the Brigadier's.  Where's Smollett?
Went to get some dinner, sir.
Call the Oberst out. I'll be responsible. You can have me and the Major as hostages.
That will be all right, sir.
Now look here - I can't leave you two.
Don't worry - you can't finish the port by 11.30.
[[Theo!]] You Prussian stiff-neck! The only way is to kidnap you!
 What can I do?
 OberstKretschmar-Schuldorff-Major- General Blomfield - Major Davies, you know.
 Intimately.]]
 [Now, let's have a look at you.] You've worn well, old chap. Still got my mark on you, I see.
And you still need a moustache!
Well, if you two are going -
Going where?
Home. Come on! I've a taxi waiting.
When were you captured?
July '16. [[Nearly three years in prison.]]
You were lucky. You missed the worst of it.
[[Nevertheless]] I would prefer to have been unlucky.
[That's what you think.]  Have you heard from home?  Have you any children? How is Edith?
Which shall I answer first?  Edith is [[well]] [all right], as far as I can tell.
Boys, eh? Now that one's exactly like Edith.
Karl?  Yes, he is, isn't he?] [[We have]] [I almost wish we had] no children. [[It's better we haven't.]] What future can children have in a beaten country?
 [Oh] You Germans are all a bit [[mad.]] [crazy. You wait till you meet] Barbara [[will]] [ - she'll] tell you what's what.
Who's Barbara?]
[[Did I tell you I was married? By the way, old man, you're going to get a bit of a shock when you see Barbara - ]] [My wife. Oh, of course, you don't know I'm married. You'll get a bit of a shock when you see her.]
 [Shock?] I am sure she is charming.
 [[She's more than that!  You'll see! She's out now - taken her mother to the theatre. But she'll be back in time.]] [I don't mean that. You wait and see. Of course, you won't see her. She's gone out to the theatre with her mother. Never mind.]
Very respectable, your house! Your streets and houses have so much dignity - but even more draughts.
 Good evening, sir.
You're right about the draughts, my boy. That's what blows us English out of our houses and all over the world - eh? - he?  I must tell that to Barbara!
D'you like it?  It was left me by my Aunt. Murdoch: leave the Oberst's things there and have a taxi at eleven. Come on, Theo!
Won't that be too late?
Now leave everything to me. I want you to meet some of the men you've been fighting with!
Gentlemen, this is [my friend] Oberst Kretschmar-Schuldorff. (There is a murmur of acknowledgement.) [Sir Archibald Blair, shining light of the Foreign Office. General Beveridge...
How d'you do. I've heard about you, Oberst.]
Major-General Taylor-Grant - General Keen - Major Michael Cornish and his brother Major John Cornish -[[Rear]] Admiral Sir Merton Barrow of the so- called Senior Service - Commodore Brandon-Crester, ditto - [Major Davies you know.
Intimately.]
[[Sir Terence Blair, from the Colonial Office - Lord Clement-Selby, Lieutenant Governor of Gibraltar]] [Colonel Hopper, aide to the Governor of Gibraltar] - Sir William Rendall, [[First Secretary to the Viceroy]] [on the Viceroy's staff] - George Metcalf of Uganda - Sir John Bembridge, just back from Jamaica - Colonel Mannering, [known to the press as] the uncrowned king of Southern Arabia - Mr Christopher Wynne, of Bradford, England, my father- in-law. [Embodiment of all the solid virtues.]
[[Drink, Theo?]] [Sit down, Theo. What will you have to drink?]
 Port [please].
It has to go round the clock.]
Cigar? Cigarette?  [They're both on the table - thousands of them.]
Cigarette, please.
Turkish! Virginian!]]
I don't suppose you remember me, but we met in Berlin in '02.
Oh, did we?
Ah, Barstow.  Colonel Barstow of the Royal Air Force.
Don't get up.]
I'm glad you're on your way home at last, Oberst.
Thank you, sir.
Can't imagine anything more awful than to be a prisoner of war in England.
I don't think it can be much good anywhere, General.
[[But]] [Oh], my dear [[Oberst]] [fellow], in this country people are always poking their noses into everything. Did you get any letters from spinsters?
 [[No.]] [Yes, we did.]
[[Shows you had a sensible Commandant. Lots of Camps were pestered by them.]] [I thought so.] They started a campaign to write to prisoners of war - not our chaps, mind you!
[[We were spared.]] It was not so bad - we had books, [[camp-]]concerts, lectures...
[[We nearly had a lot! Ha! Ha!]] [Bit too thorough for us!]
Was the [[food]] [cooking] good?
[[Quite good.]] [It was English cooking. 
A sense of humour!]
My daughter, Joyce, started a campaign to better the food for German prisoners in England.
I remember the Government was also [[accused of]] [charged with] over- feeding them.
I was taken to one of those Food Economy meetings during the shortage. The Ministry of Food speaker asked her audience point-blank if there was anyone present who wanted the prisoners' ration reduced. Nobody answered.  Then a woman stood up and said that only when we ourselves were starving, which was very far from being the case, should we be justified in starving prisoners of war. Then the speaker asked whether, if any of the audience saw a starving German prisoner, he would not at once share his food with him? They laughed, and then they cheered.]]
Oh, we're not too bad. [Drink up, gentlemen.
 Your health.]
[[Where did you leave Davies and Blomfield?]] [What have you done with old Tiger Blomfield?]
At [Victoria, in the bar of] the Grosvenor. [[They're]] [He's] hostage[[s]] [for the Oberst].
Now where is the sense in guarding officer-prisoners nearly a year after the fighting is over?
I imagine it is more to [[defend]] [protect] us.
[[Defend]] [Protect]? Against what?
People.
EMPTY_LINE
How do you mean?
Your people. They cannot be adjusted from war to peace as easily as you [can], gentlemen.
I think you'll find that's not true.]
Do you [[think]] [mean to say] our people would attack you in that uniform?
[[It is only natural.]] I tried to Englishmen [in this uniform]. [[I'm an enemy.]]
[[Oberst, you're quite wrong.]] [My dear fellow, that's rather a gloomy point of view, isn't it?]
You've got the wrong end of the stick, old man. The war's over. There's nothing to bear malice about. You're a decent fellow and so are we!
I'm not a decent fellow! I'm a beggar, like the [[other 800 officers in our camp]] [rest of all the professional soldiers in our army]. A beaten country can't have an army. What are we going to do?
I imagine there'll be a lotto do.
But not for us.] We know a [[little]] [bit] about horses, we can be stable- boys.
You'll feel different when you're home again.
Home! But what will home be like? Another prison camp?
Who says so?
Aren't we] [[We are]] going to have foreign troops occupying our cities [for years?]. [[You set us prisoners free but we shan't be free because our whole country is going to be a prison camp.]]
I've never heard a man more wrong than you are!  We don't want to make beggars out of you!
We are a trading nation, we must have countries to trade with.
[[We don't want you out of it. It simply can't be done.] ] [Surely you realize that the reconstruction of Germany is essential to the peace of Europe?]
[[And where do you get this idea that we are going to keep millions of men under arms to occupy your country?]] [I can't see our tax-payers keeping an army in your country. Can you, Candy?]
Of course not.] Read the papers, man! The English papers!  [[I]] [We] can't ask you to be [[my]] [our] friend, if [[I]] [we] rob you and humiliate you first. That's how we all feel. We want to be friends!
How is the old German scepticism?
 Fabelhaft! (He has no English words for it.)
Here I am!
Give my love to Edith!  Tell her - no, don't tell her anything! Come and see us sometime in London, or wherever we are!
Just like when we went to war...!
Well, I think we made an impression on him!
[[Es ist unglaublich!  I have to say it in English, the German language has no words for it.]] 'We want to trade with Germany,' said one!  A General said: 'We don't want to keep an army just to occupy your country!' A General!  They are children] Boys! playing cricket! They win the shirts off our backs and now they want to give them back, because the game is over!  War is the most unpopular thing in England!  They are already organizing pacifist societies, their newspapers are anti-militarist Here can we get to something! [[This is our chance!  Their]] [This child- like] stupidity is a raft for us in a sea of despair!  Do you know what my friend, [[Brigadier-]]General Candy said? He said  [We'll soon have Germany on her feet again.]
[[... so I told]] [The last thing I said to] him: 'My dear old chap, [don't you worry,] we'll soon have Germany on her feet again!'
 And he believed it?
Theo? I believe so. I hope so. [[Don't you?]]
Darling, don't hum.
Was I humming?
Yes, it's a little habit you've got.
 What'll I do if I don't hum?
 Mr H. Bruck and Mr S. Bruck.
You can go.
Thank you.
Thank you.
 Mr Theodor Kretchmar-Shuldorff!
Mr Theodor Kretschmar-Schuldorff?
[[Yes.]] [Here.]
Sit down.
Thank you.
Your Registration Book and Identity Card, please.
Please!
[Sit down.] When did you arrive in this country?
On the 6th of June [[19]]35.
From?
Paris, France. I [[came to]] [arrived in] Paris on the 15th January 1934.
From Germany?
Yes.
Why did you leave Germany?
My outlook of life is against [[Nazism]] [the Nazis].
Most refugees left Germany early in 1933, when Hitler came to power...
I had nothing to fear from Hitler. At least I thought so. It took me eight months to find out I was wrong.
Rather a long time.
Don't you think so?
Please, I mean no offence - but you in England took five years.
 Quite right.  Have you been in England before?
Yes. I was a prisoner of war in the last war.
 I see you were an officer. When did you leave the army?
In 1920  eight out of ten officers had to retire when the German Army ceased to exist  I mean as a large army...
You prefer the existence of a large army?
[[No]] [Not any more]. In 1920 I chose a new profession  Military Chemist  I worked for thirteen years in a factory at Mannheim.
Are you married?
My wife is dead.  In 1933.]]
Children?
Two. I have no connection with them. They are good Nazis - as far as any Nazi can be called good.
[[Well,]] I'm afraid, Mr Kretschmar- Schuldorff, that doesn't sound very much in your favour.
 I have tried to answer correctly.
 [[No doubt, but-]] [Personally, I don't doubt your good faith. But I am here to safeguard my country's interests. You may be an anti-Nazi. You may not be. In times like these, one enemy in our midst can do more harm then ten across the Channel. If you were here to work for the enemy, what would you tell me now?  Exactly the same - and that our enemy was your enemy. I know this is hard on those who are really with us. But it should be their best assurance that this time we mean business. If you are a friend, our precautions are your precautions and our interests are your interests.  Because our victory will be your victory.] Is there anything you would like to add?
 If you won't mind, sir?
Go ahead.
Since I have lived in foreign countries, I am very cautious.]] In earlier years the most important principle of my life used to be: Never lie, always speak the truth.
[[An excellent]] [A very good] principle. I hope you still keep to it.
I have not told a lie. But I also have not told the truth. A refugee soon learns that there is a great difference between the two.
The truth about me is that I am a tired old man who [[has come]] [came] to this country because he is homesick.  Don't stare at me, sir, I am all right in the head. You [[see]] [know that], after the war, we had very bad years in Germany. We got poorer and poorer. Every day retired officers or schoolteachers were caught shoplifting. Money lost its value, the price of everything rose except of human beings. We read in the newspapers that the after-war years were bad everywhere, that crime was increasing and that honest citizens were having a hard job to put the gangsters in jail [[where they belonged]]. Well, [I need hardly tell you that] in Germany, the gangsters [[started to put]] [finally succeeded in putting] the honest citizens in jail. [[Do you know, sir, who were the first pillars of the Nazi Party? The dirt of the people, the lazy ones, the drunkards, the scum of the country. Ask, sir, all these people who come here before you. They will remember them. In every business there was one who had no talent and no desire to work or to learn; and one morning he appeared with a brown shirt on and a revolver in his holster. Then they were joined by the huge army of easy-going people who always say: 'I am an engineer and I understand engines: that's enough forme!']] My wife was English. She would have loved to [[return]] [come back] to England, but it seemed to me that I would have been letting down my country in its greatest need, and [so] she stayed at my side. [[When at last she would have come]] [When in summer '33, we found that we had lost both our children to the Nazi Party, and I was willing to come], she died. Neither of my sons came to her funeral [Heil Hitler]... and then in January [[1934]] [1935],! [[came up alone]] [had to go] to Berlin on a mission for my firm. I drove up in my car. I lost my way on the outskirts of the city, and suddenly [[I recognized] I the landscape [seemed familiar to me. Slowly I recognized] the road, the lake and a nursing home, where I spent some weeks recovering [[many]] [almost forty] years ago. I stopped the car and sat still remembering. [You see, sir,] in this very nursing home, I met my wife for the first time ... and I met an Englishman who became my [[best]] [greatest] friend [[all those years, although we have only met twice since then  in 1919]]. [And I remembered] the people at the station [in '19], when we [prisoners] were sent home, cheering us, [treating us like friends] ... and the faces [[round a polished table]] of a party of distinguished men who were kind and [[did their best]] [tried their utmost] to comfort me when the defeat of my country seemed to me unbearable... And very foolishly I remembered the [[English]] countryside, [the gardens,] the green lawns [[where I spent the long months of captivity]], the weedy rivers and the trees she loved so much. [And] a great desire came over me to come back [[here]] to my wife's country. [[At first I couldn't get a permit. But I tried - and tried again.]] [And this, sir, is the truth.
Haven't you got anyone in this country who knows you well, a British citizen?
The doorman at the chemical works where I offered my services. The police officers at the Aliens Department at Bow Street.
 Sentry!  Don't you know Major-General Clive Wynne-Candy?
Yes, I used to know him.
Did you ask him to come here and testify on your behalf?
Yes, I did send him a letter, but I suppose he...
By gad, sir, Lord Prendergast was right!  He told me I'd never find this blasted school!  My card, sir!
[Theo, my dear chap,] Let me have a good look at you, [[old bean - my old German bean - eh? - dashed good!]]  By gad, you've kept your figure better than I have!  Bit of a bay window, eh? [[But there's life in the old dog yet!  Sorry, sir, to butt into your court- martial, unpardonable intrusion and all that sort of thing, but I only got down from the North yesterday and I'm off to France - well, mustn't say when, but damn soon!   Found this idiot's letter waiting for me, put Sherlock Holmes on his track, got his address -  Don't think much of your choice in digs, old chap - they said you had to come here  the war, I suppose - so I dropped Buggy Prendergast at the Club - he'd had enough - and came along myself to take you home with me -  If it's all right with you, sir.
I'm afraid, Clive, that I can't come with you.
Why not?
They are going to intern me.
 Pooh! Ridiculous!
My dear General, the law is the law. This is a civil court and you have already disturbed it. I have the greatest respect for your -
 Gad, sir, I'm awfully sorry. I come bursting in like a bull in a china shop! You're absolutely right, sir, you're absolutely right! I apologize!
I know him well, sir, and I'd go bail for him anywhere.  You can have all the credentials you want. I know everybody in London who is anybody! Is this a Home Office or a Foreign Office do? Can I use your telephone? Hullo! Hullo! Operator!  He's just exactly the opposite of the men we ought to be interning! Hullo!  Operator!]] [You see, sir, I wouldn't be surprised if this fellow really dislikes us. He comes to England twice in his life: the first time he's a prisoner and the second time he's about to be one.  May I talk to him, sir? I haven't seen him for nineteen... er...
Twenty.
Twenty years and a bit.
Afraid not here, General. We have many Kretschmar-Schuldorffs waiting.
You mean to say that I've travelled eleven miles from  mustn't say where - and you won't allow me to have a word with a condemned man?
Well, you don't have to go back this minute, do you?
Tomorrow morning, sir, and infernally early too.
Well, you can talk to him all day and all night till midnight  Aliens' Curfew, you know.
And can I take him with me?
If you say you know him.
Do I know him?
And will stand surety for him.
With everything I have, sir.]
It's time I was going. [[I must be home by midnight.]]
[[Why midnight?]] [The night is young yet.]
[Don't you remember?] Curfew for aliens.
 Ah-yes...
I have to be home by midnight.
Don't forget, sir. You have to be up for 6.30.
Early parade, eh?
Yes.
How lucky you are.
Yes, they put me on the retired list in '35. But I knew they'd want me again. Back I went on the active list like a shot.  I mean, why don't you stay here? I've eighteen rooms.  Murdoch!
Thanks, Clive, but I don't think I had better. I would need a special permit anyway.
You called, sir?
All right, Murdoch, it was nothingno! [[As you were!]]  Stay a little longer, I'll send you back by car. Murdoch, tell Miss Cannon to be here at quarter to twelve.
Yes, sir.
Who's Miss Cannon?
[[Johnny]] [Miss] Cannon, my driver. [[A.T.S.]] [M.T.C.]
[Do you] Remember, Clive, we used to say: 'Our army is fighting for our homes, our women and our children'? Now the women are fighting beside the men. [[In Germany,]] the children are trained to shoot. [[Only remains]] [What's left is]: the 'home'. But what is 'home' without women and children?
 You never met my wife. Do you want to see [a picture of] her?
Very much... (They both laugh as they stand up.) ... do you remember when that was all I could say in English?
You got further with it [then] than I ever got.
In what respect?
My dear fellow, don't tell me you [[never knew]] [didn't know]...
What?
[[That I - dash it, don't]] [you] make me blush!
But I don't know what you are talking about.
Well - I thought it was written all over my face when I left Berlin in [[19]]02.
Don't forget, I never saw [[you]] [your face] after you left.
 I was in love with [her - ] your wife.
 She never told me...
She never knew.
But [[when I told you]] [I seem to remember] - that last day [in Berlin] - [[that I loved her]] - you seemed genuinely happy...
Dash it - I didn't know then. But on the train I started to miss her - it was worse on the boat - and by the time I was back in London -well, I'd got it properly. My Aunt Margaret got on the scent [[right]] [straight] away, women have a nose for these things. Besides I did a stupid thing! First night back I took out her sister...
Aunt Margaret's?
Edith's.
 Martha?
Yes. Martha.
But what was stupid about that?
 Thinking her sister would be like she was.
[Like] Edith?
Yes.]
 [[Anyway]] [Well], you got over it.
That's just it, I [[didn't]] [never did get over it]. Theo, this may sound a damn silly thing to say to you but I never got over it. [[I suppose you could]] [You may] say she was my ideal - if you were some [sort of] sickening long-haired poet all my life I've been looking for a girl like herso now you know
 I never thought it possible that an Englishman could be so romantic...  And your wife you don't mind my asking? You loved her...?
Yes... dreadfully. She was exactly like Edith. I'll show her to you...
 She's very lovely.
Isn't she like Edith? Eh? See the resemblance?
 Yes... there is something very striking... But you mustn't forget, I saw Edith thirty-one years later than you. We grew old together - you understand?
 Hm! -yes [[suppose so]] [of course] but she was [[very]] [exactly] like her -
 It's a strange place to hang such a lovely picture.
She wanted it. I call this my Den, you know. She knew I always used to come back here, we had a joke about it - all my stuff is here. It would be an awful gap without her ...
Have a peg - what?
 It must be terrible to lose someone very dear to you in a foreign country.
 It wasn't a foreign country. It was Jamaica.
[[God bless you. Come back safely, Clive.]] [Bye, Clive.  Have a nice journey.]
[[Nothing to worry about!]] [Don't worry about anything.] Everything under control.
I hope it is as you say.
Will you close the door, sir, please.
Oh, shut up, Murdoch.
Good luck, Murdoch.
Thank you, sir, but the General isn't taking me. I stay [[here and do A.R.P.]] [to look after things here.]
 You know the way, [[Miss Cannon]] [Angela]?
Yes, sir.
 Good hunting. There's just room in the Den for Hitler's moustache!]]
The door, sir, please.]
Did you see the Warden?
I am the Warden of this District, sir.
You don't mind my sitting beside you?
No, sir.]]
It must be difficult driving in the black-out.
[[It looks more than it is.]] [It's not as bad as it looks, sir.]
I suppose you've done a lot of night- driving?
No, sir. (She realizes she must explain this.) I never drove before the war.
What made you learn?
My boy-friend taught me. But not at night. 
Is he a good driver?
First-rate. He's one of the Bentley boys. [[But]] just now he walks [on his two flat feet]. He's a private. In training.
What was your job before the war, Miss Cannon?
Photographic model.
Interesting work.
[[It was all right]] [Not bad]. A bit hard on the feet.  How did you know my name, sir?
[[I heard]] the General [told me about you].
Oh, [[of course.]] [Did he? Mind if we try to beat the lights, sir?  Sorry, sir, couldn't make it.
Do you like being [[his]] [the General's] driver?
Who wouldn't?  He's an old darling. I could have done a hand-stand when he chose me. [[It was at an inspection.]] [D'you know] He picked me out of seven hundred girls to be his driver.  Some odds [[700 to 1]] [wasn't it?]
Look at that headlight. He ought to be reported.
 That's what causes accidents.  Long odds, weren't they, sir?
 I beg your pardon?
Seven hundred to one! Makes me a bit of an outsider. 
What is your first name, Miss Cannon?
Angela.
Lovely name. It comes from 'angel' [doesn't it?].
I think it stinks. My friends call me 'Johnny'.  Is it this crossing or the next [,sir]?
[[I'll get out here]] [Oh, this will do]. [[Many thanks.]]
Goodnight, Angela.
Goodnight, sir.
I'd like to see your boy-friend one of these days.
Me too! [Goodnight, sir.]
EMPTY_LINE
General Wynne-Candy has just passed through the entrance hall, sir.]]
He's on his way down now.]
[[Thank you.]] [For the love of Gielgud, go and stop him as he gets out of the lift. If you let him put one whisker inside the studio, you are out!
 ... out.
This way, [[sir]] [General].
General Wynne-Candy?
 [[Mm!  - ]] [Yes.]
This way to Studio 5, sir.]
Mr Herbert Marsh would like to see you, sir.
Never heard of him!
[[One of the directors.]] [Yes, but he's heard of you sir.]
[[Mm! - Mm - Ah, yes!]] [Oh, has he? Good. 
[It's] This way [to Studio 5], sir. ([Pointing in opposite direction.])
Lead on!
When does my [[ - ah!]] broadcast start precisely?
Well almost at once, sir.]
[[The Postscript, sir?  About]] [At] 21.20. [, sir].
[[Lots]] [Plenty] of time [[-good-
Excuse me, miss.
Oh, shut up. 
Regular rabbit warren, eh?
Yes. 
Beehive of industry. D'you like working here?
Oh, very much. You meet such interesting people.
You can tell that from the programmes.]
I don't think I've met you, sir.
[[I have never had the]] [No, I'm afraid I've not had that] pleasure. Won't you sit down?  Cigarette?
 Very snug quarters here. And deep!
 We need to be these days.
Quite agree!  Back to the Stone Age, what? (He puts down his cigarette.) Think I'll leave this, if you don't mind. Bad for speaking. Makes my throat dry.
[[There may be some difficulty]] [General, I'm afraid we've been having a bit of trouble] about your broadcast [[,General...]].
[[Can't be worse than Dunkirk.]] [Well, I'm used to trouble. I'm a soldier.]
[[We have been advised at the last moment that your broadcast is considered]] [Yes, the - um - authorities think it's a little] ill- timed and [[must be]] [that it might be better] postponed ...
 [[Considered? Considered? Who is considering? Why?]] ['Think it's a little ill-timed.' Who has been saying that? Why?]
[[I'm afraid]] [Well], General, [you know] that in time of war [[it is]]
Don't talk to me about war! 
 No. [Of course,] That would be -  Grotesque.
I have been asked to describe in this broadcast my views of the cause of the Retreat and its aspects for the future. There they are!  I have been serving my country for forty- four years. What was your position before this one, sir?
 Lawyer.
What? A lawyer!  Well, I was a soldier. And before that, I suppose you were at college. And I was a soldier. And I was a soldier when you were a baby, and before you were born, sir, when you were nothing but a toss-up between a girl's and a boy's name - I was a soldier then! (He suddenly stops, collects himself, stares at Mr Marsh.) I'm deeply sorry, sir. I know it's not you.
 No. I'm afraid [[not]] [it isn't].
I will make the necessary enquiries through the War Office. I'll have a light for this cigarette now, if you please.  [[Thanks. Pity I sent my car away.]]
What can have happened?
I was expecting it.
Why?
I've read his speech.
The General!
 [[We apologize to listeners for]] [Sorry about] the short delay. Here is Mr Priestley.
Murdoch! Where can I go? The General mustn't find me here! Murdoch!
Let me handle it, Angela...
No fear. Let me out of here!
Hullo, Theo. If supper's ready, you can serve it, Murdoch.
I'm very sorry, sir.
Hm? Why?
I shouldn't be here - I -
I asked Miss Cannon to come in. She was anxious to hear your broadcast.
Cancelled! At the last minute. Pity we hurried like we did, Angela.  We didn't leave the War Office until [[twenty-five]] [five and twenty] to nine.
There's a War Office letter here, sir. It came this afternoon.
Paul Reynaud [has] resigned. Petain is Prime Minister.
Bad news.
What? (He has started reading the letter.) Oh, yes - bad news.
 Ah - yes! 
Sherry, miss?
Sherry, Mr -, sir?
Yes please.]  How is your fiance?
 He's not my fiance.
[Beg your pardon. How is] Your boy- friend?
He's getting a commission.
Congratulations.
[[I think]] I ought to go [you know].
 [[Wait a little longer.]] [No, stay a bit.]
[[O.K.]] [Down the hatch.  Any news about your application ?
Turned down. Enemy alien.
But you're an expert!  Why didn't you ask him. He knows everybody.
He was [[in France]] [away].
Dinner is served, sir.
Ah-yes.
 I'm going now, sir. Will you [[need]] [want] the car [any more]?
I've brought another cover, sir.
 All right. Sit down, Angela. Theo!
Sit down, both of you.
Never mind, Murdoch.  Thank you, sir, but I had dinner.
Have another, Angela.
No, really - I -
 If you're worried about sitting down with your General, then stop worrying. I'm not a General any more.
 Clive! What has happened?
Retired [again]. Axed!  They don't need me any more.
I'm sorry, sir. (Passing the sherry glass to CLIVE.)
 I know how that feels.
No you don't!
I was barely forty-five when it happened to me.
Different kettle offish!  [[Your country was]] [You were] made to do it. [But] We're not finished - nor am I! Just starting!  - I've often thought - somebody like me dies - special knowledge - awful waste  Well, am I dead? Is my knowledge worth nothing?  Skill experience  eh? You tell me -
It's a different knowledge they need now, Clive. The enemy is different. [[The defenders must be]] [So you have to be] different too.
[[Have you gone]] [Are you] mad? I know what war is!
I don't agree. I read your broadcast up to the point where you describe the collapse of [[your own sector in]] France. You commented on Nazi methods, foul fighting, bombing refugees, machine-gunning hospitals, lifeboats, lightships, baled-out pilots, by saying that you despised them, that you would be ashamed to fight on their side and that you would sooner accept defeat than victory if it could only be won by those methods.
So I would!
Clive!  If you let yourself be defeated by them, [just because you are too fair to hit back the same way they hit at you,] there won't be any methods but Nazi methods! If you preach the Rules of the Game while they use every foul and filthy trick against you, they will laugh at you! They think you're weak, decadent! I thought so myself in 1919. [[Filthiness! That is their secret weapon!]]
 I[['ve]] heard all that in the last war. They played foul then. And who won it!
I don't think you won it! We lost it!  But you lost something, too. You forgot to learn the moral. [[Because victory was yours]] you failed to learn your lesson twenty years ago, you have to pay the school fees again! Some of you will learn quicker than others. Some will never learn it. [Because] You have been educated to be a gentleman and a sportsman - in peace and in war. But, Clive, [[my dear fellow]] [dear old Clive], this is not a gentleman's war. [[This is a life and death struggle, with your backs to your cliffs against the hordes of barbarism.]] [This time you are fighting for your very existence against the most devilish idea ever created by a human brain  Nazism.] And if you lose there won't be a return match next year, perhaps not even for a hundred years! (He pats CLIVE'S [[hand]] [shoulder].) You mustn't mind me, an alien, saying all this. But who can describe hydrophobia better than one who has been bitten - and is now immune?
 Well, you see, Angela - eh?  Even one's best friend lets one down...
I don't think so, sir.
 You, too, eh? Kick a fellow when he's down - what?
 Nobody would ever kick you, sir. [[You'll have]] [You've just got] to change over, that's all.
Change over? To what? (He already speaks in a stronger voice.)
Well - [[some other]] [a new] job [[,sir]]. It's easy enough for a man.
Hm! Think so, do you? Swop horses in midstream - eh?
 A lot of people had to in this war, sir. It's better than drowning.
Bravo, Angela! I shall call you Johnny in future!  She's hit the nail on the head! I don't know you. You shouldn't give up so easily, my boy. Is this the same man who took Berlin by storm forty years ago? Look at me! Nobody wants me but do I give up?
 Nobody wants you - and you're an expert. I don't know anything but soldiering -  not even that, apparently.
What about the Home Guard, sir? They [[must have]][need] leaders. They are just becoming an army. If we are invaded, they're] [[will be]] our first [[line of]] defence - [[all]] the papers say so.
There you are! You know everybody, you could get them arms and instructors and equipment! [[I wish I could join.]] What a grand job, forming a new army.
 EH? - HOME GUARD-?
 Yes, sir. I was going to tell you myself, sir.
You're drunk, Murdoch. Tell me what?
That I'd joined the Home Guard, sir.
You?
Yes, sir. (He is about to clear away when he realizes no food has been touched.) Anything wrong with the soup, sir?
 How should anyone know if nobody's touched it. Take it away, [[Private]] [Lance- Corporal] Murdoch!
 Sergeant Murdoch, sir. (Gathering up cold soup.) What have you been doing, sir, all this time?
 Nothing, you blockhead, except talk!  But watch now!
[[Crikey!  This is a bit of all right!]] [Hello! What's this?]
Upsadaisy! (He has hold of a long curved thing.) Give us a hand, Marmaduke!
Hi, missus. Two basins, for me and me old chum. (Scares her with boar's head.)
Who is the bloke that lived here, Harry? Huxley?]]
[See this?  Major-General Clive Wynne-Candy- [[Boodles Club]] [moved to Royal Bathers' Club, Piccadilly.
I should think he needed a bath after this lot. Good luck to the old bastard.]
Still here?
Just going, General.
Don't be late!
I won't, sir.
By gad!  what on earth's that?
 Gun, sir. [[My]] brother's a gamekeeper.
That's the ticket!  Load with No. 4! We'll soon have rifles  tommy-guns, too. Know which end is which  eh?
 [Oh] Yes, General.
[[Hah!]] [That's right.]
Break it up, chaps.  Good afternoon.
Where to, sir?
War Office.]]
By gad, we'll have proper weapons or I'll know the reason why!  I won't leave their damn doorstep!  I'll make a sit-down stroke - or a stay- in strike - or whatever they call it! I'll show'em! Angela! Eh?
A real army - eh? The men are all right- keen as mustard! - Organization, General Staff, Offices, General Headquarters-that's what we [[need]] [want] and, by gad, we'll get 'em! D'you hear, Angela?
Yes, sir.
[[One thing at a time.]] Give me [[a]] [one] year [- six months]! I'll show 'em!
 Take the afternoon off.
Thank you, sir.
Club - 7.30.
Very good, sir.
Interior: G.H.Q. Home Guard, Marble Arch
Gentlemen! This is Der Tag! What!  [[I've been conferring with the G.O.C. of the 6th Army Corps.]] This is the most vital and comprehensive exercise in which the Home Guard have yet taken part. Defence of London! We've trained for it. We can tackle it! We'll put up a good show, eh?  [[I know you're all as keen as I am.]] We'll show these youngsters there's life in the old dog- eh? Gentlemen! War starts at midnight!
[[Quarter to six! Mark time! I've got a date with Mata Hari!]] [Five minutes easy, Sergeant.]
Hullo, Johnny.
Hullo, Spud.
[[Tea - and the bill with it. I've got to go.]] [Got to go in a minute.]
 [[Rightaway?]] [Why?]
[[Yes.]] Got a job on.
[[Where are you going, you liar?]] [Oh, you would have.]
 Come [[here!]] [along, have a look.]
I feel a criminal.
So you are. Why?
Using Army petrol.
: You ought to be shot. Probably will be.]]
See that?
What, those trucks?]
My private army!
[Well,] What about it?
You remember [[when I rang you this morning]] [what you told me last night - amongst other things]?
Yes I do. And I wish I hadn't told you.
Why do you think I wanted the [[dope]] [low-down] on 'Sugar' Candy's movements?]
[[Of course.]] [Well, why did you?] What's the mystery?
We're off to see him!
Who?
The Wizard!
What for?
Because of the wonderful things he does. We're going to teach him Total War!
[[How?]] [Shut up, Spud. What do you mean?]
Capture him! War starts at midnight! We're going to bag him hours before that. Nazi methods. You know.
You're not a Nazi!
[[The Home Guard isn't]] [We're not] training to fight Englishmen!
You can't do that, Spud!
Can't I? [[Watch me!]]
[[How can you do such a thing to him?]] [I won't let you do it.] He's such a dear old man...
So will I be when I'm over the hundred!  Ah, tea.
[[I won't let]] [How can] you do it! I know what this would mean to him!
You can't stop me, Johnny. [[Inside]] [Within] an hour the Wizard will be the captive of my bow and spear not to mention three dozen of the toughest troops between here and [[Tobruk]] [New Zealand]. [[Now where's that girl with the tea?]] [Come on, drink this.]
Spud!  Don't you see? I gave you the information. It's mean to take advantage of it!
 Don't be a sissy! In war anything goes!   [[You have to use the first weapon that comes to hand!]] [(They circle each other, warily.]
All right!]]
Hey, stop that!]
 Oh, darling! [[You asked for it!]]
[[Help!  Murder!]] [He's dead!]
Spud!]
She got me!
Who?
Mata Hair! [[Stop her!]] [Come on!] Quick!
You need a field dressing on this.
Grimly She'll need a field dressing somewhere else when I catch up with her.]]
[[Not a hope!]] [Well, any luck?] She's half way to London [by now].
[[Come on! We've got to get her! She wants]] [She's gone] to warn the Wizard! (They all sweep out like a pack in full cry.) [Come on, get my tin hat. Get after her, quick.]
 Who's going to pay for the tea?
 Charge it to E.P.T.!]] [The Sergeants' Mess.]
Mr Marshall!
Really, miss, it's quite impossible.
Get on the phone, then. Go on, man.
Very good.  Head Porter speaking. His driver wants to speak to General Wynne-Candy. Yes, it's...
Is Major-General Wynne-Candy in the Club?
No, sir. The General left an hour ago with Brigadier-General Caldicott and Air Vice-Marshal Lloyd-Hughes.
Did he say where he was going?
Excuse me, sir, what is your business with the General?
I have a message for him - an urgent message.
If you will give me the message, sir, I will see that the General gets it.
But dammit all, man - ! (Suddenly changes tone.) Are you in the Home Guard?
Why, sir?
 The password is 'Veuve Cliquot 1911'!
 The General and his staff are in the Turkish Baths, sir.
 Right!
 You're in charge here. Stay with him.  Don't leave your desk or use the 'phone.  You're a prisoner of war.
But war starts at midnight.
Ah ha, that's what you think. Sergeant, that girl under the desk: she's a prisoner too.
Sir!
Corporal, follow me. Brute force and ruddy ignorance.
 Hello, hello. Well warn him then. Can't you understand? Tell him to hide...]
The Turkish Baths, Northumberland Avenue.
 The Turkish Baths, Northumberland Avenue. Quick! Matter of life and death!
What are you doing? Stop it!  How dare you? Help! Police!  Porter! Hullo!  Hullo!
Been in?
 Defence in depth. Have you got it?
All serene.
Here are your orders. That's their secret code!  Get on the blower and contact their H.Q. Orders have got to go out to all Posts to let the Enemy through the barricades. From midnight on! Spin 'em a yarn. It's a trick! Grand Strategy! Be Clever!
 What a dish!
Jump to it. I'll be with you in a sec.
[[I'm sorry,]] Gentlemen  the war will soon be over.  We agree that it's nice to win the last battle but [[we'd sooner]] [we much prefer to] win the first!
You will be kept prisoner in this building until 6 a.m.
 It's all right, sir. He's still there.
 Hullo, Theo!]]
Hullo, Clive!
[[Nice of you to come.]] [Hello, Theo. I'm glad you've come.] I couldn't have stood anyone else.
That's all right.
You heard, I suppose?
[Yes,] Johnny told me.
And?
[I think] It was a dirty trick but I can't help finding it a bit funny too.
It is. That's the worst of it.
What [[will happen - officially]] [do you think is going to happen now]?
[[I suppose]] [Officially] this young [[officer]] [fellow] will be [[court- martialled]] [brought before a court of inquiry] and the Exercise [[will be]] repeated on some other date. ([[With a change of tone.) They won't find the Home Guard so easy next time!]]
 Will [[he be court-martialled]] [there be an inquiry, sir]?
[[Yes.]] [No, there won't. I'll see to that. Where is he now?]
Will you give evidence?
Have to.]]
[[What will happen to him?]] [Spud, sir? He's with his men. They're marching into London.]
 [[He'll be all right.]] [Did you see them?]
[[When we crossed]] [Yes, we saw them come across] the Cromwell Road [[we saw them coming]]. The whole Army.  With bands.
 Did you see 'em, Angela?
 How [[do]] [did] they look? Eh?
[Well, Clive,] I must say, [[Clive]] [they]...
 [Oh,] They looked [[grand]] [OK]!
They've cleaned up my place [[quite]] [rather] nicely.
Oh!  They've built an emergency water [[supply]] [tank] too!
I've been thinking this over all night. I don't want to get this young fellow into trouble. I think I'll invite him to dinner instead. Wasn't I just as much of a young fool as he is? Of course I was.
Yes, but I wonder if he's going to be such a grand old man as you are.
When I was a young chap, I was all gas and gaiters with no experience worth a damn. Now, tons of experience and nobody thinks I'm any use. I remember when I got back from Berlin in '02. Old Betteridge gave me the worst wigging I ever had. And when he invited me to dinner, I didn't accept - often wish I had. Yes, I think I will invite him to dinner. And he'd better accept, d'you know!]
[[They're coming this way.]] [Yes, sir, here they come.]
 Hm! Better go!
Isn't it all the same who's going to win this war: the old or the new Army?]]
... promise to stay just as you are until the floods come... and this is a lake...]
 Now here is the lake - and I still haven't changed... (He shakes his head, his smile grows broader) ... Hopeless!
Sir?]
