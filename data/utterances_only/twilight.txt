I'd never given much thought to how I would die..
Bye, Bella!
Good luck at your new school!
Have a good..
... life.
It won't work again, baby.
You put it on hold.
I did?
Look. You also called Mexico.
I'll figure it out. You gotta be able to reach me and Phil on the road - love saying that - on the road.
Very romantic.
If you call crappy motels, backwater towns and ballpark hot dogs romantic.
Now, you know if you change your mind, I'll race back here from wherever the game is.
I won't change my mind, mom.
You might. You've always hated Forks.
It's not about Forks, it's about Dad. I mean, two weeks a year, we barely know each other.
Mom, I want to go. I'll be fine.
Your hair's longer.
I cut it since last time I saw you.
Guess it grew out again.
How's your mom?
Good.
 That's right. One bathroom.
I'll just put these up in your room
I can do it
Bella, you remember Billy Black.
Glad you're finally here. Charlie hasn't shut up about it since you told him you were coming.
Keep exaggerating, I'll wheel you down the hill.
Right after I ram you in the ankles.
I'm Jacob. We made mud pies together when we were little kids.
Yeah... I think I remember..  Are they always like this?
It's getting worse with old age.
So what do you think of your homecoming gift?
No way. The truck is for me?
Just bought it off Billy, here.
I rebuilt the engine and -
It's perfect!
Okay, so you gotta double pump the clutch when you shift, but -
Maybe I can give you a ride to school.
I go to school on the reservation.
Too bad. Would've been nice to know at least one person.
You're Isabella Swan, the new girl. Hi. I'm Eric. The eyes and ears of this place. Anything you need. Tour guide, lunch date, shoulder to cry on.
I'm kind of the suffer in silence type.
Good headline for your feature I'm on the paper, and you're news, baby, front page.
I -- no, I'm not news -- I'm, seriously, not at all
Whoa, chillax. No feature.
You've missed a lot of the semester, but I can hook you up - tutor, cliff notes, medical excuse..
Block it, Chloe! Yeah! Good attack!
Ow!
(hurries to him,
Are you alright? I warned them not to make me play.
It's only a flesh wound.
You're Isabella, right?
Just Bella.
I'm Mike. Newton.
She's got a great spike, doesn't she?
That's why they kicked me out.
Mike, you met my home girl Bella.
Your home girl?
Sorry, needed a candid for the feature
Feature's dead, Angela. Don't bring it up again.
Sorry. There's always eating disorders, or Speedo padding on the swim team
-- Wait, that's a good one..
Who are they?
The Cullens.
Doctor and Mrs. Cullen's foster kids. They all moved down here from Alaska two years ago.
They kinda keep to themselves.
Because they're all together. Like, together together. The blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett..
... they're a thing. I'm not even sure that's legal.
Jess, they're not actually related.
But they live together. And the little dark haired girl, Alice, she's really weird..
... she's with Jasper, the blonde who looks like he's in pain. mean, Dr. Cullen's like this foster dad slash match maker.
Maybe he'll adopt me.
Who's he?
That's Edward Cullen.
He's totally gorgeous, obviously. But apparently, no one here is good enough for him. Like I care.
I wasn't planning on it.
Welcome, Ms. Swan. Follow along as best you can till you get caught up.
We're going to cut them in half, then watch them regenerate into two separate worms..
... Yes, folks, zombie worms! They just won't die.
 I'll just... endure it.
Jerk.
Member me, honey? I was Santa one year.
Waylon, she hasn't had a Christmas here since she was four.
Bet I made an impression, though.
You always do.
Let the girl eat her cod, Waylon.
 That'd be great, thank you.
So... you eat here every night?
Easier than washing dishes.
I can cook.
I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix. Mom's not great in the kitchen.
I remember..
How was school? Meet anyone?
A few people... Do you know the Cullen family?
 Are people talking about them again?
No... well, a little.
Just cause they're newcomers. We're lucky to have a surgeon like Dr. Cullen at our podunk hospital. Lucky his wife wanted to live in a small town. Lucky his kids aren't like lot of the hell-raisers around here.
... Okay.
I just don't like narrow mindedness.
If spring training goes well, we could be living in Florida permanently.
Please insert 25 cents to continue.
Mom, where's your cell?
Ok, I didn't lose my power cord. It ran away. Screaming. I literally repel technology now.
Dad, I'm heading out. ON BELLA'S FACE as she opens the door and stops, dismay filling her. It's pouring down rain --the yard is full of puddles, some frozen. Bella shivers, wraps her coat tight. BELLA Great. WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her truck. BELLA Dad, I can drive myself to school.
You okay, Bells? BELLA Ice doesn't help the uncoordinated.
That's why I got you new tires. She looks over at the truck -- yep, four new tires. CHARLIE
You got me new tires. No one's ever done that before.
I mean... nothing.
I'll be late for dinner. I'm heading down to Mason County. A security guard at the Grisham Mill got killed by some kind of animal..
An animal?
You're not in Phoenix any more, honey. They've been hunting it for a week with no luck. Thought I'd lend a hand.
Be careful.
Always am.
And thank you. For the tires.
... and yeah, prom committee is chick thing, but I gotta cover it for the paper anyway, and they need a guy to help choose the music - So I need your play list
Come on, Arizona. Give it up for the rain.
Terrific.
Hello.
I didn't have a chance to introduce myself last week. My name is Edward Cullen.
 ... You're Bella.
I'm... yes.
Come on, people. Tick tock.
Ladies first.
You've been gone.
Out of town. For personal reasons.
Prophase.
May I look?
Prophase.
 Like I said.
Enjoying the rain?
Seriously? You're asking me about the weather?
It appears.
No. I don't like the cold. Or the wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or turtle necks.
She snaps out of it. Covers with a dry look. BELLA May I?
Anaphase.
Like I said.
It's complicated.
I think I can keep up.
My mother remarried.
Very complex. So you don't like him.
Phil is fine. Young for her, but nice enough.
But now you're unhappy.
No... I -- I just..
Did you get contacts?
... no.
It's just the fluorescents.
Bells. Are you alright?
I'm fine, dad. Calm down.
I'm so sorry, Bella. I tried to stop.
It's okay, Tyler.
It sure as hell is not okay.
Dad, it's not his fault-
 We nearly lost you.
But you didn't.
You can kiss your license goodbye.
Good. Dr. Cullen.
 I've got this one, Jackie.
You have a nice knot growing back there, but your x-rays show no indication of concussion.
I'm so sorry, Bella. I'm really
It would have been a lot worse if Edward hadn't knocked me out of the way.
Edward? Your boy?
It was amazing he got to me so fast. He was nowhere near me.
 As long as you're safe.
I just have to sign some paperwork. You better call your mom.
You told her?! She's probably freaking.
This isn't just about you, it's about all of us -
Let's take this in my office.
Can I talk to you for a moment?  How did you get over to me so quickly?
I was standing right next to you.
You were next to your car, across the lot.
Yes. You were.
You're confused. You hit your head.
I know what I saw.
And what, exactly, was that?
You stopped that van. You pushed it away.
No one will believe that.
I wasn't planning to tell anyone.
I just want to know the truth.
Can't you just thank me and get over it?
You're not going to let it go, are you?
No.
 Then I hope you enjoy disappointment.
Why did you even bother?
... I don't know.
That was the first night I dreamed of Edward Cullen..
Make sure I get your permission slips.
 Look! You're moving. You're ALIVE!
... Yeah, false alarm..
Actually, I'm glad you're not dead cause - well, that would suck, plus wanted to ask you - even though it's, like, a month away..
So what do you think?  You want to go? To prom. With me.
 Prom. As in dance. I, uh - have to go
You can't go another weekend?
Non-refundable ticket. Maybe you should ask Jessica.
...c'mon, Eric, stuff that compost down deep... that's it..  ... now Tyler, take a big steaming cup of compost tea. This is recycling at its most basic level - hey, don't drink that!
Hello, Edward.
Really?
What's in Jacksonville?
How did you know about that?
You didn't answer my question.
You haven't answered any of mine. You won't even say hello.
Hello.
And how did you stop that van?
Adrenaline rush. Very common. Google it.
It helps if you actually watch where you put your feet.
I know I've been rude, but it's for the best.
Guess who just asked me to prom!
I totally thought Mike was going to ask you, Bella. Is it gonna be weird?
No way. Zero weirdness. You guys are great together.
I know, right?
Bella, it would be better if we weren't friends.
You could have let the van crush me and saved yourself all this regret.
 You think I regret saving you?
I know you do.
 You don't know anything.
The bus is leaving.  Hi. Will you be riding with us?
No. Our bus is full.
Your mother called. Again.
Your fault, for telling her about the accident.
She always did know how to worry.
He is.
La Push, baby. You in?
Should I know what that means?
La Push beach, down on the Quileute rez. We're all going after school. Big swell coming in.
And I don't just surf the internet.
Eric, you stood up once. On a foam board.
There's whale watching, too. Come with.
La Push, baby.
I'll go if you stop saying that.
 Edible art..
Thanks... but your mood swings are giving me whiplash.
I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be.
What does that even mean?
It means if you were smart, you'd avoid me.
So let's say, for argument's sake, that I'm not smart. Would you talk to me? Tell me the truth?
Probably not. I'd rather hear your theories.
Okay... how bout radioactive spiders? Kryptonite?
(levels his gaze,
You're talking about superheroes. What if I'm not a hero? What if I'm a bad guy?
 No. I don't believe that. You're not bad. You can be a jerk, but it's like this... mask. To keep people away.
Look, why don't we just - hang out. Like... come to the beach with us. It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, salt water stinging your eyes..
 Which beach?
La Push.
Is something wrong with that beach?
It's just a little crowded.
I keep thinking Eric's going to ask me to prom, then he just... doesn't.
You could ask him. (off Angela's flustered
Take control. You're a strong independent woman.
I am?
Bella!
Guys, this is Jacob. Are you stalking me?
You're on my rez, remember? You surfing?
Definitely not.
 Keep her company. Her date bailed.
What date?
She invited Edward.
 To be polite.
I think it's nice she invited him. No one ever does.
Because Cullen's a freak.
You got that right.
You know them?
 The Cullens don't come here.
You want to go look at tide pools?
So, what did your friend mean about the Cullens not coming here?
Oops. Caught that, huh?
I'm not supposed to say anything.
I can keep a secret..
Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath?
So the legend about the Cullens is..
Well, they're supposedly descended from this, like..
Didn't they just move here?
Or just moved back.
Riiiight. So what was this treaty?
AAAAAAAAGH!!!!!!
Wait... what were they really?
 It's just a story, Bella.
Jerry?
Come on, Jerry, you old mutt..
H-how did you do that?
Always the same inane questions..
What do you want?
Why are you doing this?
 ... James, must we?
The question should be, will it hurt?
He's not here.
They just... ditch?
I'm going to the prom with Eric! just asked him, I took control!
It's a family thing.
Oh my God, we need to hit the stores in Port Angeles before the dresses get cleaned out.
Port Angeles?.. (a plan forming in her mind) Can I go with you guys?
Thank God. We need your opinion.
I think this halter makes my boobs look big. What do you think, Bella?
Bella?
 It looks great.
You said that about the last five dresses.
 You're not very good at this, are you?
You sure?
Look, just take my bag.
Get in.
What -- no, how did you find --
 I should go back and rip their heads off.
No. Bad idea.
You don't know the vile, repulsive things they were thinking.
And you do?
 Not hard to guess.
Where were you!? We left you a message.
We waited, but we were starving
Sorry I kept Bella from dinner. We ran into each other and got talking.
I - we - understand. We were just... leaving, so
Okay, well. Thank you.
... If you'd like. Then I could drive you back myself.
That's so... thoughtful.
Really thoughtful.
 I could eat.
You're not eating?
I'm on a special diet.
Like South Beach?
Not exactly.
So how bout some answers?
Yes, no. To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851.
I didn't ask for the square root of pi.
You knew that?
How did you know where I was?
I didn't.
 Don't go.
Were you following me?
I feel very protective of you.
So that's a yes?
Yes, I followed you. I tried to keep my distance...until you needed help.
 You said before... That you heard what those guys were thinking.. Can you... read minds?
I have no idea. I can read every mind in there, except yours.
Why, what's wrong with me?
I tell you I read minds and you think there's something wrong with you?
What is it?
I... don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore.
Edward, you don't have to.
 This is wrong.
Edward
You're cold. We should go.
I think I'm warm enough now.
Your hand, it's still freezing cold.
That's my father's car. What's he --
Carlisle. What happened?
Waylon Forge was found in the woods out near his place. I just examined the body.
He died? How?
Animal attack.
The same kind that killed the security guard down in Mason?
Most likely.
So it's getting closer to town.
Waylon lived all the way down on Queets River. 75 miles south.
But that's
(with a kind, reassuring
Bella, you should go inside. Waylon was your father's friend.
Dad, I'm sorry about Waylon.
Known him going on thirty years.
We'll get to the bottom of this, Bella. But in the meantime..
... I want you to have this.
That's probably not a good
It'll give me some peace of mind.
BELLA ... it's not possible.. Off BELLA'S FACE, struggling to make sense of it all.. MATCH CUT:
Edward, don't go. But Alice gently removes Rosalie's hand from his arm. ALICE He's already there.
You're impossibly fast. And strong. Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold. Your eyes change color. And sometimes you speak like... you're from a different time.
How old are you?
Seventeen.
How long have you been seventeen?
... A while.
I know what the Cold Ones are. What you are.
Say it. Out loud. Say it.
... Vampire
Are you afraid?
No.
You won't hurt me. You're different.
You think you know me?
Where are we going?
Up the mountain. Out of the cloud bank. You need to see what really am. What I look like in the harsh light of the sun.
No! The sunlight will kill you.
Myth. You need to see the truth.
Slow down.
Are you afraid?
No.
Then come with me. Someplace where no one can protect you. Where could do what I've wanted to do from the first moment I met you.
I'm not afraid.
Hold on.
Are you afraid!
No!
Edward? Where are you?
This is what I am.
You're... beautiful..
I don't believe that.
Because you believe the lie. The camouflage. I'm the world's most dangerous predator. Everything about me invites you in - my voice, my face, even my smell. As if need any of that..
As if you could outrun me. As if you could fight me off.
I'm designed to kill.
I don't care.
I've killed people.
It doesn't matter.
I wanted to kill you. I've never wanted a human's blood so much in my life. I'm dangerous to you.
I trust you.
Don't.
I trust you, Edward. I'm here.
Edward?
You... took me by surprise.  I don't know how to... do this.
Me, and my family, we're different from others of our kind. We're not nomadic, we have a permanent home. We only hunt animals. We've learned to control our thirst..
 Oh... I thought you hated me when we met.
I did. For making me want you so badly. I'm still not sure I can control myself.
I know you can.
I wish I could understand this thing you see in me. You look at me with those eyes..
I'm afraid.
 Good.
Not of that. I'm afraid... you'll disappear. That I'll lose you.
Be very still.
And so the lion fell for the lamb.
Stupid lamb.
Sick masochistic lion.
About three things I was absolutely positive. One, Edward was vampire.
Two, there was a part of him that thirsted for my blood. And three..
... I was falling, unconditionally and irrevocably, in love with him.
How long have you been like this?
Since nineteen-eighteen. That's when Carlisle found me.
Where'd he find you?
In a hospital, dying of Spanish influenza. My parents had already died.
What was it like?
The word excruciating comes to mind. But what Carlisle did was much harder... not many of us have the restraint to do that.
Didn't he just... bite?
Not just. Our bite contains venom. And once we taste blood, a sort of.. frenzy begins. It's almost impossible to stop.
But Carlisle did.
First with me, then with his wife, Esme. He found her in a hospital, as well. The others followed.
Does someone have to be dying to become like you?..
... No, that's just Carlisle. He would never do... this, to someone who had another choice.
So Carlisle's the reason why you hunt animals, instead of people.
Not the only reason.
I don't want to be a monster.
We call ourselves vegetarians, by the way... For our kind, hunting animals is like living on tofu. It keeps you strong but isn't very satisfying.
Show off.
It's not that impressive, really. Anyone in my family can do this.
Can they all read minds, too?
No, that's unique to me. But Alice can see the future.
Her visions are very subjective. The future can change.
Come to my house tomorrow.
Your house? With your family?
But... what if they don't like me?
I'm glad I amuse you.
What is it?
A complication.
I'll pick you up tomorrow.
Come to visit your truck?
Looks good. You got that dent out.
Actually, we came to visit your flat screen. First Mariners game of the season. Plus Jacob here kept bugging me to see you again.
 Great, Dad. Thanks.
Pale Ale.
 Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.
Any luck with the Waylon case?
A person did that?
A crazy person, walking around barefoot this time of year.
Spread the word out at the rez, will ya? Keep the kids out of the woods.
Will do.  Don't want no one else getting hurt.
It's... wonderful. EDWARD You expected turrets, dungeons and moats? BELLA No... not moats. He takes her hand. She girds herself. They head inside.
It's so light and open.
Thanks to tinted windows... It's the one place we never have to hide.
Bon giorno?
Molto bene!
I hope you're hungry.
Oh, absolutely
She already ate.
Perfect.
I just assumed -- because you don't eat, you know..
Of course. That was very considerate of you.
 Ignore her. I do.
Yes, let's keep pretending this isn't dangerous for all of us.
I would never, ever tell anyone.
 She knows that.
The problem is, you two have gone public now, so..
No, she should know.
... Badly?
Hi, Bella!
Alice. ALICE
 And you're Jasper, right?
Pleasure to meet you.
 You won't hurt her, Jasper.
I'll give you a tour of the house.
 I'll see you soon.
Graduation caps?
A private joke. We matriculate a lot.
What a nightmare, repeating high school.
True, but the younger we start out in new place, the longer we can stay there.
... and this is my room.
So you're obsessed with music. But..  No bed?
No sleep.
Ever?
No nightmares, no drool, no snoring.
Do you have any favorites?
Depends. Alternative? Jazz? Sixties, seventies..
Ooh, she knows her music. Alright, nineties. Eighteen-nineties. Classical.
I'd have to say... Debussy.
My favorite, too.
No dancing.
Ever?
No tripping, no falling, no derision.
 I can always make you.
You don't scare me.
You really shouldn't have said that.
Don't you dare -
She's brought him to life.
He's been alone too long... but how can it end well?
Alice has been wrong before.
Not often.
Trust me?
In theory.
Then close your eyes.
Open.
Gambling, tuxedos and -  Bond. James -- ow!
Guys, we got something
They took the bait.
By tomorrow they'll be half way to Winnipeg.
I love when men chase me.
Yo, Arizona. So. You and Cullen.
Sorry I'm late. Biology project.
Ordered you the seafood combo.
Order one for yourself next time. You should cut back on the steak.
I'm healthy as a horse.
The suspect's moving east. Kitsap County Sheriff is taking over from here. They're putting extra guys on.
Hope they catch him fast.
Your friends are flagging you.
It's okay you wanna join them. I'm just gonna turn in early anyway.
Yeah, me, too.
It's a Friday night. Go out. The Newton boy's got a big smile for you. Nice family, the Newtons.
He's just a friend.
None of the boys in town interest you?
We're not really going to talk about boys, are we?
Just... you should be around people. I leave you alone too much.
Berry cobbler, two forks.
So spring training's going well?
Phil's working hard. We're looking around for a house to rent, in case it becomes permanent. You'd like Jacksonville, baby.
Actually, Forks is kind of growing on me.
(stops, knows there's
Could... a guy have something to do with that?
 Maybe..
Tell me everything! Jock? Indie? Bet he's smart. Is he smart?
 Well... he is kind of a history buff.
I, uh... have to go.
No way, we gotta talk boys. Are you being safe?
I'll call you later, Mom.
How did you get in here?
The window. As always.
You've been here before?
What else is there to do at night?
You're a peeping Tom! Perv!
Shh! The Chief will hear you!
I just... like watching over you.
There's something I'd like to try.
 Oh... I'm... oh.
I'm stronger than I thought.
Wish I could say the same. I'm so embarrassed.
Don't be. But we have to be careful.  I can never lose control with you. Ever.
I have a date with Edward Cullen.
He's too old for you.
We're both juniors. I thought you liked the Cullens.
And I thought you weren't interested in any of the boys in town.
Edward doesn't live in town. And it's in the early stage and - whatever, he's outside right now.
Now? He's out there?
He wants to meet you. Officially.
Good.
Be nice, okay? He's... important.
Chief Swan. I wanted to formally introduce myself. I'm Edward.
I won't keep Bella out late tonight. We're just going to go play baseball with my family.
Bella's going to play baseball?
Yes, sir, that's the plan.
Well. More power to you, I guess.
 She'll be safe with me, sir, I promise.
 You got that pepper spray?
No fair, reading Charlie's mind.
And since when do vampires like baseball?
It's the American pastime. Plus, there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the only time we can play. You'll see why.
Good thing you're here. We need umpire.
 She thinks we cheat.
I know you cheat. Call em as you see em, Bella.
It's time.
 Now I get why you need the thunder.
That has to be a home run.
Edward's very fast.
Yer out?
Stop! I didn't see them..
They're traveling so quickly
You said they left the county -
They did, but then they heard us..  And changed their minds.
 Put your hair down
Like that'll help. I could smell her from across the field.
I shouldn't have brought you here. I'm so sorry.
I believe this belongs to you.
Thank you.
Could you use three more players?
Of course.
I'm Laurent. This is Victoria. And James.
Would you like to bat first?
I'm afraid your hunting activities have caused something of a mess for us.
Our apologies. We didn't realize the territory had been claimed.
Yes, we maintain a permanent residence.
Really? Well, we won't be a problem any more.
The humans were tracking us, but we led them East-
You brought a snack.
The girl is with us.
 We won't harm her.
 Just try it.
I think it best if you leave.
Yes, I can see the game is over. We'll go now. James?
Get Bella out of here. We'll follow them.
James is a tracker. I saw his mind. The hunt is his obsession, and my reaction set him off -
-- We're a large clan of strong fighters all protecting one vulnerable human.
The first place he'll go is your house. He'll track your scent there.
I said, leave me alone!
Bella, don't do this. Just think about it, please
Get out! It's over.
Bella? What happened?
I have to get out of this place. Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now.
 I can't hurt him.
Bells. Did he hurt you?
No, Dad.
Then what? Did he break up with you?
I broke up with him.
I thought you liked him?
That's why I have to leave. I don't want this. I want to go home.
 I'll be in the truck.
Your mother's not even in Phoenix.
She'll come home. I'll call her from the road.
You can't drive home now. I'll take you to the airport in the morning.
I want to drive. I need time to think. I'll pull into a motel in few hours. I promise.
Bella... I just got you back.
He'll forgive you.  Slide over..
His face... I said the same words my mother used when she left him.
It was the only way he'd let you go.
Your father's safe now, Bella. The tracker is following us
It's alright. It's just Emmett. Alice is in the car behind us.
He came to warn us. About James.
I've grown tired of his games. But he's got unparalleled senses. Absolutely lethal. I've never seen anything like him in three hundred years ... And the woman, Victoria, will back him. Don't underestimate her.
I'm truly sorry for what's been unleashed here.
I've had to fight our kind before. We're hard to kill.
But not impossible. We'll tear him up
I don't relish killing another creature. Even a sadistic one like James.
If he doesn't get to one of us first.
Too late.
I'll run Bella south, while you lead the tracker away
No, Edward -- the tracker thinks you won't leave Bella. He'll follow you.
I'll go with Bella. Jasper and will drive her south.
 Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent.
If any of you get hurt because of me
We won't, there are five of us, two of them. When it's done, I'll come get you.
You're my life now.
I wish he'd call.
You should eat.
They could get hurt. It's not worth it.
 Yes. It is.
Edward's changed since he found you. And none of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he loses you.
What do you see?
 The tracker. He just changed course..
Where will it take him, Alice?
Mirrors. It's a room of mirrors.
How do the visions work? Edward said they weren't always certain.
She sees the course people are on, while they're on it. If they change their minds, the visions change.
So the course James is on now will lead him to... a ballet studio?
 You've been here?
No. I don't know. I used to take ballet lessons as a kid. The school had an arch like that.
Was your school here in Phoenix?
Yeah, around the corner from my house. But I haven't been there in ten years.
Do you have any reason to go now?
No. Hell, no. I hated the place.
Edward. Are you alright?
I'm coming to get you. (hates having to say
We lost the tracker. The woman is still in the area. Rosalie and Esme are protecting your father.
Bella, we're in too deep. We can't change how we feel..
No... we can't.  When will you get here?
In a couple hours. Then you and will go somewhere. Together. The others will keep hunting.
Mom, I'm so glad you got my -
 Bella? Bella? Where are you?
Calm down, Mom. Everything is fine, okay? I'll explain every
... Mom? Are you there?
Nice house you have here. Not the best on the block, but comfortable.
I was prepared to wait for you. But then Mom came home after she received a very worried call from your Dad. It all worked out quite well.
I must say, Forks High School doesn't protect its students' privacy very well. It was just too easy for Victoria to find your previous address.
Bella? Bella?..
Leave my mother out of this.
You're protective of her. That's nice. You can still save her. But you'll need to get away from your friends. Can you do that?
I... don't think so.
If your mother's life depends on it?
Where should I meet you?
The old ballet studio around the corner. And I'll know if you bring anyone along. Poor mommy would pay the price for that mistake.
 8th and Palo Verde, please.
Bella? Bella?
Bella, where are you?
Don't you want to dance, baby?
Everyone makes fun of me.
But you're a wonderful dancer.
Mom, I suck.
That's my favorite part. Stubborn child, weren't you?
She's not here.
Sorry. But you really made it too easy.
So to make things more entertaining, I'm going to make a little film of our time together. Borrowed this from your house. Hope you don't mind.
Excellent! An escape attempt.
It'll break Edward's little heart.
Edward has nothing to do with this.
He will. His rage will make for more interesting sport than his feeble attempt to protect you.
Beautiful! Very visually dynamic. I chose my stage well.
Still stubborn, aren't you? Is that what makes you special? Because frankly, I don't see it.
Too bad he didn't have the strength to turn you. Instead, he kept you this fragile little human. It's cruel, really.
Well done! You've succeeded in annoying me.
Tell Edward how much it hurts.
Tell him to avenge you.
No! Edward, don't..
Cut! The end.
You're alone... because you're faster than the others. But not stronger.
I'm strong enough to kill you.
Her femoral artery's been severed. She's losing too much blood
It's on fire! My hand!
Venom -
No!
It's going to happen. I've seen it
It doesn't have to be that way.
Alice, find me a tourniquet. rag, a shirt.
It's burning!
What's the other choice? You said
 Tighter, above the knee
You can try to suck the venom out.
I -- won't be able to stop
Find the will to stop. But choose, she only has minutes left.
It's alright, Bella. I'll make it go away.
Stop. Her blood is clean, you're killing her.
Death is peaceful. Easy.
Life... is harder.. An oxygen tube rests under her nose. She reaches for it, confused. A hand stops her as her surroundings come into focus. RENE (O.S.
Edward? Where's - RENE He's asleep. She nods across the room to a chair in which Edward sleeps.
He never leaves. And your dad's down in the cafeteria.
What... happened?
Baby, you fell down two flights of stairs and through a window.
Edward came here to convince you to come back to Forks. His father brought him down. You went to their hotel but you tripped on the stairs. A moment... then Bella realizes it's a cover story. She nods. BELLA Sounds like me.
It's Phil. He's worried about you.
Mom, you're... texting.
That's great mom.
Jacksonville is always sunny and you'll have your own bathroom..
Mom, wait. I want to live in Forks. I have Dad..
 And he's there.
Charlie doesn't like him. Blames him for your leaving.
What do you think?
Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad? want to talk to him. Apologize.
I'm sure he doesn't care about that, Baby. But Ill go get him.
Is James - did you --
We took care of him. And the woman, Victoria, she ran off.
I'm alive because of you.
 You're in here because of me.
The worst of it... was thinking couldn't stop -
But you did.
Bella, you should go to Jacksonville. Where I can't hurt you anymore..
What? No! I want to be with you! don't want
Heard that before.
 I put new pepper spray in your bag.
... and... you look beautiful.
You really are trying to kill me.
Prom is an important rite of passage. I don't want you to miss anything.
Shall we?
 You're serious.
See? You're dancing.
At prom.
Edward... why did you save me?  If you'd let the venom spread, I could've been like you by now.
I want you. Always.
 I won't end your life for you.
I'm dying anyway. Every minute, I get closer, older
That's how it's supposed to happen.
Not the way Alice saw it.  I heard her. She saw me like you.
Her visions change, Bella.
Based on what someone decides. And I've decided.
Is that what you dream about? Becoming a monster?
I dream about being with you forever.
You really want this?
Yes.
You're ready right now?
Yes.
You're going to have a long and happy life with me. Isn't that enough?
For now.
No one will surrender tonight. But I won't give in. I know what I want.
