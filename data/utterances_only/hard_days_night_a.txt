Eh... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
What little old man?
 That little old man.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
That's not your Grandfather.
It is, y'know.
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
How d'you reckon that one out?
Well... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
 Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
How's that?
Oh... he's nursing a broken heart.
Aah... the poor old thing.
Eh, Mister... are you nursing a broken heart then?
 You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
A butcher?
Yeah, she was fickle.
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
 No... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Oh, I see.
 Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
 Hello, Grandfather!
Hello.
 He can talk then?
 Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
 Well... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
And we're looking after him, are we?
I'll look after meself.
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
He's got you worried, then?
Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.
 Gerron.
No, straight up.
The lad's given you the simple truth. I'm cursed wid irresistible charm, I'm too attractive to be let loose.
You got on all right then?
Hi, Shake.
We're here. Norm'll be along in a mo' with the tickets.
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
It's Paul's grandfather.
Oh aye, but I thought...
 No, that's his other one.
That's all right then.
 Clean though, isn't he?
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
Morning, lads.
Morning... Hi, Norm.
 Well, thank God you're all got here. Now, listen, I've had this marvellous idea... now just for a change, let's all behave like ordinary responsible citizens. Let's not cause any trouble, pull any strokes or do anything I'm going to be sorry for, especially tomorrow at the television theatre, because...
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
 You're a swine, isn't he George?
 Yeah... a swine.
 Thanks...
Eh...
Well, who is he?
He belongs to Paul.
 Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
We'll follow you down.
I want me coffee.
He can come with Shake and me if you like.
Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
 He's very clean, isn't he?
Make up your minds, will you!
 Do you mind if we have it opened?
 Yes, I do.
Yeah, but there are four of us, like, and we'd like it open, if it's all the same to you, that is.
 Well, it isn't. I travel on this train regularly twice a week, so I suppose I've some rights.
Aye, well, so have we.
And we'll have that thing off as well, thank you.
But I...
An elementary knowledge of the Railway Acts would tell you I'm perfectly within my rights.
Yeah, but we want to hear it and there's more of us than you. We're a community, like, a majority vote. Up the workers and all that stuff!
Then I suggest you take that damned thing into the corridor or some other part of the train where you obviously belong.
 Gie's a kiss!
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
I travel on this train regularly, twice a week.
Knock it off, Paul, y' can't win with his sort. After all, it's his train, isn't it, Mister?
And don't you take that tone with me, young man!
But...
 I fought the war for your sort.
Bet you're sorry you won!
I'll call the guard!
Aye... but what? They don't take kindly to insults you know. Ah, come on, you lot. Let's get a cup of coffee and leave Toby the manger.
Eh, Mister... can we have our ball back!
Yeah, you want to watch it.
 It's not my fault.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
 They always say that.
Yeah, well I got me eye on you.
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to... (he is about to thump SHAKE.)
 If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
He started it.
No, I didn't you did...
Well, what happened?
The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'
And?
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
I knew it, he started it, I should have known.
Y'what?
You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
You're right. Here you are, old devil.
Would you ever sign this one for us, Pauly?
Come on let's get this coffee.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
 Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
 If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
 I'll murder you, Grandfather!
Eh, look at that talent.
Give 'em a pull.
Shall I?
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
 I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
George Harrison, The Scouse of Distinction.
 Excuse me, but these young men I'm sitting with wondered if two of us could join you; I'd ask you meself only I'm shy.
 I'm sorry, miss, but you mustn't fraternise with my prisoners.
Prisoners!!
Convicts in transit to Wormwood Scrubs. Typical old lags, the lot of 'em.
Y'what!!!
Quiet, you lot, or I'll give you a touch of me truncheon.  That little one's the worst. If we don't keep him on tablets he has fits.
 Now look here!!
Get out while you can, ladies, his time's coming round for one of his turns.
He's been gone a long time.
 Who?
Paul's grandfather.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Down the... er...
Oh, down the... er...?
Yeah, down the... er...
Well, give a couple of minutes...
 Yes, I'm their manager, I discovered them.
Did you indeed, Mr. McCartney?
Now, Audrey, I told you, the name's John. We show biz people are a friendly lot.
Of course, John.
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
The usual ten per cent?
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty- five; sure aren't there four of them?
 How fascinating. Do go on...  ...John.
...Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart... Well, I let...
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
No... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
 Have you lost him?
Don't exaggerate.
You've lost him.
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
He can't be far.
I hope he fell off.
 Don't be callous.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell... It's 'cos I'm little.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.
Are you going in?
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
Excuse me but have you seen that little old man we were with?
We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all! (he extends his hands as if handcuffed) Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
I was innocent. I was framed. I won't go back.
I bet you can guess what I was in for.
How about that one?
 Did you look in here?
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
Well, let's broaden our outlook.
 Congratulate me, boys, I'm engaged.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time... and who's paying for all this?
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
Oh, well that's all right.  What?
Young man, kindly moderate your tone when you address my fiance.
I'm sorry, Missus, but the betrothal's off. (he grabs GRANDFATHER by the arm) I'll refuse me consent, he's over- age!
Leave him alone, after all he's done for you is this the way you repay him?
 Him? he's never done anything for anybody in his life.
 You dare to say that when even those ridiculous clothes you are wearing were bought when you forced him to sell out his gilt edged Indomitables!!
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
Look, Missus, this is all a misunderstanding, you see, he's...
Keep away from me, you depraved lout, I know all about your terrible past.
Y'what?
He's given me a bad character, blackguarding me name to all and sundry. He's got to be stopped. It's not fair.
That's one of them... stop thief!
 Oh Mother!!
 And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
Don't dramatise.
Let's face it, you're lucky to be here. If they'd have had their way you'd have been dropped off at Stafford already.
Well, you've got to admit you've upset a lot of people. At least I can keep my eye on you while you're stuck in here.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean... he's very upset, you know... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing...
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
 You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Yeah... so what?
Why do you always use your left hand?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
Shove up!
Odds or evens?
Odds.
 Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up... It's all your fault.
Me? Why?
Bag-snatcher.
That's right; convict without trial... Habeas corpus.
 Every morning.
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
Like what?
Well, I've got me gob stopper. (he produces his mouth organ.) Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
No.
Ah, go on, you swine.
No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
Oh no!
All right, lads, follow me.
Vive l'amour!
 Go like the clappers, son!
 That was my entire intention, sir.
I don't snore.
You do -- repeatedly.
 Do I snore?
 You're a window rattler, son.
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
 With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
Paul, John, George -- get at it.
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
None for me, then?
Sorry.
That'll keep you busy.
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
You go and pick on your own.
Is that yours?
For Ringo.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
He comes from a large family.
 Well.
Eh, what's Boyd's Club?
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
 And they want me?
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
 Well you're not going.
Ah.
 Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
That's mine.
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
Why?
It's homework time for all you college puddings. I want this lot (he indicates the fan letters) all answered tonight.
I'll brook no denial!
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
Come on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to their penmanship.
While the swine's away the piglets can play. Well, come on, what are we waiting for?
What about all these letters?
Read 'em!
And a free champagne buffet.
Alors, M'sieur?
 Soufle.
I bet you're a great swimmer. My turn? Bingo!
Pas "Bingo," M'sieur... Banco.
 I'll take the little darlings anyway.
Two and one is three, carry one is four.
Lay them down.
 Eh?
Lay them down.
We'd be thrown out.
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
Huit  la pointe... et sept. (He pushes chips and box to Grandfather.)
You had a lovely little pair, y'see.
I did?
They're yours.
They are?
The cards... you're bank.
Bingo!
 M'lord dit "Bingo."
 A little light refreshment.
 A glass of the old chablis to wash down a gesture of giblets wouldn't go amiss.  Soufle, chop chop.
Now get on with it.
We were going to do it.
Aye, well, now! (He goes through bedroom)
Any of you lot put a man in that cupboard?
A man? No.
Well somebody did.
He's right, y'know.
 Ah well, there you go.
Eh, what's all this?
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
 You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
The old gentlemen borrowed them to go gambling at Boyd's.
No!
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
 Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
Encore de champagne, Monsieur?
Yes, and I'll have some more champagne as well.
 Lord John McCartney, he's the millionaire Irish Peer, filthy rich of course.
Oh I don't know, looks rather clean to me.
Play is about to resume, m'lord.
 Lead me to it, I've a winning itch that only success can pacify.
I'm sorry sir, members and invited guests only.
Shurrup.
All we want to know is have you got a little old man in there?
 Do you mean Lord McCartney?
He's at it again. Look, I'm his grandfather... I mean...
 Oh, it must be the dolly floor show.
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life!... 
 Before you go, gentlemen, there's the small matter of the bill.
 I'll settle that.
A hundred and eighty pounds!
 I beg your pardon, guineas.
Your winnings, my lord, one hundred and ninety pounds.
How about me change?
Cloak room charge.
 Ah well, easy come, easy go.
Well.
Should I say it?
Follow your impulse.
It'll only get you into trouble.
 Aah, shurrup, misery!
 O.K. Driver, follow that car!!
 Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Sorry? (meaning: "I beg your pardon.")
Oh, don't pay any attention to him, he was just fulfilling a lifelong ambition.
I see.
Yeah, you know, "O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"
Oh, yes, now I'm with you. ([he changes his accent]) But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of... we're doing a hundred now...
Ever seen one of these before?
Ah... a shamus, eh?
I see you go to the night court.
I've made the scene.
Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.
I don't think that bit's right.
What do you expect from an ad lib... Raymond Chandler?
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
 Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
 We're nearly there, sir.
Eh... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
And I was happy in the bakery. I'll never know why I left.
Get ready John, open the door and as it draws up, out you go and straight in.
 Give us a couple of shakes to get our breath.
Eh this lot means it. They're even taking hostages.
What's your philosophy of life?
I'm torn between Zen and I'm all right, Jack.
Has success changed your life?
Yes.
Do you like playing the guitar?
Next to kissing girls it's favourites.
No, actually, we're just good friends.
 Anything to spare?
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Sure. 
Ah well. Eh, look!
Let's go and muck in.
Aye, before anyone stops us.
Here, what about these electric guitars?
Where are they?
Back here, mate.
 I'm coming.
Leave them drums alone.
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear- phones, do I?
Spoil sport!
Well!
He's very touchy about those his drums, they loom large in his legend.
What's up?
 He's sulking again.
I'll show him.
 All right I'm sorry and let's hear no more about it. If that's your opinion, you're probably right. Look, if you think I'm unsuitable let's have it out in the open, I can't stand these back-stage politics.
Aren't you tending to black and white this whole situation?
Well, quite honestly I wasn't expecting "a musical arranger" who would question my ability... picture- wise.
 I could listen to him for hours.
Heave to, what's all this about a musical arranger?
Mr. McCartney Senior!
Hey Pauly, they're trying to fob you off wid this musical charlatan but I've given him the test.
 I'm quite happy to be replaced.
 He's a typical buck-passer.
I won an award.
A likely story.
It's on the wall in my office.
Hello our lot, everyone happy?
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
Give me a bottle of milk and a packet of Oblivion. Oh, it's a plot, I see it now, it's all a plot.
 Now, come on, I've got the key.
Let's have you.
Come on speedy!
Ringo!
Wake up!
I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed your act.
 Gear costume!
 Swap?
Right, first floor and no messing about.
Lennon, leave them girls alone or I'll report you.
 I suppose you know this is private property.
Sorry if we hurt your field, Mister.
There's no one here.
This is the only way they could have gone.
 Hello.
 Hello.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're...
No, not me.
 Oh you are, I know you are.
No, I'm not.
You are.
I'm not, no.
Well, you look like him.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
Oh you do, look.
My eyes are lighter.
 Oh yes.
And my nose...
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Is it?
I would have said so.
Aye, but you know him well.
 No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
 That's what you tell me.
 What have you heard?
 It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Is it? Is it really?
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
I knew I could rely on you.
 Thanks.
You don't look like him at all.
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
That's too easy for Lennon.
 He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
But John hasn't got any.
What?
Nerves.
I know, that's the trouble.
Oh, I've toyed with the idea of a ball and chain but he'd only rattle them at me... and in public and all. Sometimes I think he enjoys seeing me suffer.
Get behind that door, they're coming. Someone's coming. Quick, hide!
What are you doing there?
Hiding.
I think you're soft or something.
We weren't hiding.
Now?
Now. We were trying to catch you redhanded. I thought I told you lot to stay here?
Well...
When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
 Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.
Good lad, Ringo.
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
You crawler.
He's betrayed the class.
Oh, leave off!!!
Temper! Temper!
Well...
Will you all get a move on! They're waiting for you!
I now declare this bridge open.
All right, hold it, hold it... O.K. John, wipe him down and we'll carry on with the next act.
Where are they? I said, where are they? Where are they?
 They're coming, I promise you.
 Now look, if they're not here on this floor in thirty seconds there's going to be trouble... understand me... trouble!!!
 Standing about, eh? Some people have it dead easy, don't they?
 Of course, once you're over thirty, you're finished. It's a young man's medium and I just can't take the pace.
Are you as young as that, then?
Shurrup!
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
 Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
 I'll set John on you!
 Oh, anything you say, Paul.
 Run through the number and try not to jiggle out of your positions.
That was more or less all right for me. I'll give them one more run through then leave them alone until the dress...  Oh how about make-up?
Not really, they don't need it any. We'll just powder them off for shine.
Good. Norm, get them along to make- up will you?
 Sure.
 And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
 What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
 You were twanging too loud.
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
Well!
He'll get over it.
All right, our lot, make-up.
You blinked!
I never did, you did.
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Well, it must be catching. He's given it to the champ here.
Stop picking on him.
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
Sit down, the lot of you.
Well, you'll just have to do us first... It makes no difference to them whether they're made up or not.  And who's me, then?
 My name's Betty... (pointing to the name on the mirror) Do you want a punch up your frogged tunic?
Now listen, John, behave yourself or I'll murder you and, Shake, take that wig off, it suits you.
 What do you think are you're up to?
Someone put it on me.
Excuses, that's all we get and you know you fancy yourself in the Coldstreams.
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
Eh, don't take out me lines.
Yeah, they give him that "Je ne sais quoi" rakish air.
 Short back and sides, please.
Behave...
Foreign devil ...
Control yourself...
In my considered opinion you're a bunch of sissies.
You know you're only jealous!
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
You wouldn't!
I would though.
What's he know?
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
 Lookit, I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery and so far I've seen a train and a room, a car and a room and a room and a room. Well, that's maybe all right for a bunch of powdered gee-gaws like you lot but I'm feeling decidedly strait-jacketed. This is no life for a free-booting agent of my stamp. I'm a frustrated man and that class of McCartney is a dangerous McCartney.
 What a clean old man.
 You're too young for a fella of my cosmopolitan tastes, so don't press your luck.
He's sex-obsessed, the older generation are leading this country to galloping ruin.
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
 Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
I don't think its allowed.
Well... it wouldn't be any fun if it was!
 Never.
That was great, you've got about an hour but don't leave the theatre.
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
 So's mine.
John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is important. Understand? Important.
 Oink! Oink!
I want me cup of tea.
Shake.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
Clever.  George.
Look after him.
But...
Do I have to raise me voice?
 Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
 Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
Well... what's the matter with that?
 Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
 You can learn from books.
Can you now? Aah... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Out where?
Any old where... but not our little Richard... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
 Books are good!
 Parading's better!
Parading?
 That's it, parading the streets... trailing your coat... bowling along... living!
Well, I am living, aren't I?
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink- edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Eh... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
Aaah... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
So you are a man after all.
What's that mean?
Do you think I haven't noticed... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
 Oh... I dunno.
 And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
Yeah... that's right.
And what's it all come to in the end?
 Yeah... what's in it for me?
A book!
Yeah... a bloomin' book!
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
Yeah... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
 You're only right.
 I'm not wrong.
Where are you off to?
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
 No. I don't.
You want to stop being so scornful, it's twisting your face.
Here he is, the middle-aged boy wonder.
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
 Get knotted!
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
Can't he? He's done it, son!
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but...
We do.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
He hasn't.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
We'll split up and search for him, he can't be far.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
I'll look in here again.
Hello.
Get out of it, short house!
Ain't you got no more bleeding sense than to go round chucking bricks about.
 Southerner!
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Oh don't be so stroppy!
 Well! A boy of your age bowling "hoop" at people. How old are you anyway?
 Nine.
Bet you're only eight and a half.
 Eight and two thirds.
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Shurrup!
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
Well --
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
Y'what?
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
I'm a deserter.
 Are you now?
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Just you?
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
 Yeah.
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
 Oh, it's all right.
 Yeah?
Yeah.
What they like?
 Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
How about Ding Dong?
He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.
Why aren't you at work?
I'm a deserter, too.
Oh.
 See you.
Oh, there you are!
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
 You haven't, you're just late. (She rises and crossing over to him examines him critically.) Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
Is he?
Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap. (She crosses to the desk and picks up the inter-office phone.) Hello, I've got one... oh, I think so... yes, he can talk... Well... I think you ought to see him.  Of course, right away.
Well... come on.
Sorry.
 Will this do, Simon?
 Not bad, dolly, not really bad.  Turn around, chicky baby.
Oh yes, a definite poss. He'll look good alongside Susan. (he indicates the girl on the poster) All right, Sunny Jim, this is all going to be quite painless. Don't breathe on me, Adrian.
Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
 Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
 Well, I did tell them not to send us any more real ones.
They ought to know by now the phonies are much easier to handle. Still he's a good type.
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
Of course I can.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
I'll have a bash.
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
Ta.
Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.
Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
Grotty?
Yeah, grotesque.
 Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
But I won't.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
I don't care.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
 Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
I beg your pardon?
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
Get him out of here!!
 Have I said something amiss?
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
 Sorry about the shirts.
Get him out.  You don't think he's a new phenomenon, do you?
You mean an early clue to the new direction?
 Where's the calendar?  No, he's just a trouble maker. The change isn't due for three weeks. All the same, make a note not to extend Susan's contract. Let's not take any unnecessary chances!
I'm sorry lads, I didn't mean it, honest.
If he says that again, I'll strike him.
 They'll be back, they're good lads, they'll be back.
 Yes? Well they've got only ten minutes to the final run-through.
I meant no harm. I was only trying to encourage little Ringo to enjoy himself.
 God knows what you've unleashed on the unsuspecting South. It'll be wine, women and song all the way with Ringo once he's got the taste for it.
 That was fresh this morning.
 That'll be two and nine...
Right... On your way!
Y'what?
You heard, on your way, troublemaker!
If I believed you, sir, I might do those things and walk those ways only to find myself on Problem's Path. But I cannot believe you, and all those urgings serve only as a proof that you will lie and lie again to gain your purpose with me.
 Oh!
 Well... go 'head, do the next bit.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
Are you supposed to be here?
I've got you worried, haven't I?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you... that's all but if it worries you... well...
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
 How'd you guess?
 Oh, it's the way you talk.
 Is it... is it, really?
 Are you pulling my leg?
 Something like that.
 I see.  Do you like the play?
Yeah... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Gear?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Thank you.
Don't mench... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
 I'm not...
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Yes.
Aye, I knew you were.
What's that mean?
Well, the way you were spouting, like....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
 The big hammer?
 Oh aye, a sledge.
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
No... I wouldn't say that... just like an actress... you know.
But that's not like a real person at all.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
They ought to be.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
 What are you?
I'm in a group... well... there are four of us, we play and sing.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
...all this and a jam butty too!!
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Why selfish?
Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well... that's why you need other people... an audience... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Is she?
Of course... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber... (Paul starts acting a Liverpool girl, he minces about then turns, extending his leg) Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it... Y'what?... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it... so there!!
 And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want... well... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
 And cunning.
And what do you do about it?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads... no, we don't have the time.
Pity.
 Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Yes.
 See you.
Of course.
Worry, will you!
 Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
I'll murder that Lennon.
But I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...
...as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
Shurrup, cheerful.
You don't think...
 They'll be here.
Oh now, they can't do that to me.  It's all your fault.  Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the...
 ...tea in China. Oh you're right, neither would I.
Traitor!
Of course.
 Hi Norm!
 Hi, our lot!
Our lot!
 Did you want something.
 I could eat the lot of you.
You'd look gear with an apple in your gob.
 Do you realise you could have missed the final run-through?
Sorry.
Eh, there's only three of them.
Aye, we were looking for Ringo. But we realised he must have come back.
Do you realise we are on the air, live, in front of an audience, in forty-five minutes and you're one short.
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Eh, where's my grandfather?
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Aye, I suppose so.
Here they are, personally signed and handwritten by your own sweet boys. The chance of a lifetime. Be the envy of your less fortunate sisters!
Look, I'm Ringo Starr... I've got a show to do in a few minutes you've got to let me go... I'm Ringo...
Sure, they all say that these days... Anyway... I don't care who you are... you can save that for the stipendary. Here you are, Sarge.
What is he?
 I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
A proper Aborigine.
 I demand to see me solicitor.
What's his name?
Oh, well if you're going to get technical --
Hello, it's going to be one of those nights, is it?  Sit Charley Peace down over there.
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me. (kicks the nearest policeman) Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
Is there a fire, then?
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
Eh?
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper.
What's he on about?
 I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
 Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
What?
 Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
 Have they?
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
 Me!
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
 Oh, they seem all right to me.
That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.
 Would you two like a cup of tea?
You see, sly villains.
 No thanks, Mr. Sergeant, sir.
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Well, he can't stop here.
What are you doing?
Lip reading.
What are they saying?
Nothing good.
Well son, it's now or never.
All right, you paid assassins. Johnny McCartney'll give you a run for your threepence ha'penny.
Now, what's he up to?
He's allergic to Bobbies, especially English Bobbies.
 Your man disappeared like a leveret over a hill.
Turncoat!
Mother!
Be God, they've called up reinforcements, the dragnet's out!
 Only half an hour and you're on!
Can I say something?
 Yes, anything.
 It's highly unlikely we'll be on... I mean the law of averages are against you and it seems that, etc., etc....
 I'll have the hides off of you lot.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go home!
I must see Pauly.
Go home then and see him on the telly.
Can you fix him for me?
Yeah.
Sixpence.
Each?
Oh, all right.
And in advance.
 Mercenary!
 It's all right, leave him alone.
Grandad, where's Ringo?
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
The police station.
He'll be pulp by now.
What are we waiting for?
Come here.
We've only got twenty minutes.
What is all this?
 Hold on until we get our breath.
All right now?
Sure.  Ready?
Ah well, it was worth a try.
 What do you think you're up to?
Arrest those boys, sir.
That's all we need to start a real riot!  Come on lads, they're waiting for you.
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Here, Pauly.
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
 What's old got to do with it?
You needn't bother.
Y'what?
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
 But I'm clean.
I've got the stuff. Come here.
Aren't we...
No, we're not!
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
Tonight? We can't make it...
You've got a midnight matinee.
Now, look here, Norm...
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
What?
You're a swine. So hurry up... we're travelling!
 Where's my grandfather?
 Don't start. Look.
 Come on, you're hanging up the parade.
