Oh, God, it's coming!  It's coming!
 Mary, mother of God, please make it stop!
... Ten years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode ...
... Now he wants her daughter.
Michael Myers is here to kill that little girl and anyone else who gets in his way!
Please ... give him to me ...
 No, please ... my baby!
 Damn you!!  Damn you all to hell!!!
Danny ...
Kill for him!
Danny!
 Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
The voice man!  He's here!
Danny, no one's there.
Some of us have to get some sleep around here.  What's with that kid?
Let me take him for you, Kara.
It's all right, Mom.  Go back to bed.
Stay away monters, stay away ghouls. Stay away from Danny.  You jerks know the rules.  Better?
Mommy, when can we go home?
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
But I've seen him!
You've been watching too much TV.
He says things.  Bad things.
Like what?
 If you mean the things Grandpa says sometimes, ignore him.  Once he gets to know you he'll come around ... Let the bad things you hear slide right off your back.
 No, Mom -- keep it on!
Okay ... But just for tonight.
 Good-night, Danny.
I know this sounds crazy, Harry, but I love him.  I write to him every week. I think I even want to have his child --
Let me get this straight, Debi.  Now you're saying that not only does this guy get you sexually aroused, but now you want to bear his offspring?!
Deep down, he's just like you and me. He just needs someone to understand him.  Someone to love him.
You're talking about one of this nation's most notorious serial killers like he belongs in some kind of Est seminar!  What planet have you been on, lady?  Michael Myers has been dead for six years!
Now we've got someone who claims he's actually seen Michael Myers.  Does this whacko caller have a name?
My name's Tommy.  I was only eight- years-old when I saw him.  But I was lucky.  I survived.
Sounds like you're a candidate for electroshock therapy, Tommy.  Don't tell me after all this time you still believe Myers is alive?!
Michael's work isn't finished in Haddonfield. Now it's just a matter of time before he comes home to kill again.  But this time I'll be ready.
Jamie?  Jamie?!
Come with me if you want to save your baby.
Oh, God ... He's coming!
We've got to move.  Now!
There!  It's that way!
No --
Save your baby -- go now!
Next up is Dwayne.  What's on your feeble excuse for a mind, "Dwayne?"
Shit!
I'd just like to say that I listen to your show every night, Harry.  I think you're the best.  I can't tell you how excited we are that you'll be paying a visit to our little town tomorrow night.
Do you have a point to make here, Dwayne, or should I just keep practicing my wrist exercises?
 Harry, you're too much.  I'd just like to say that I understand how things have changed in the 90's.  Gays in the military, cut off your husband's do- jigger, become a national hero. But I just can't see any sense in bringing Halloween back to Haddonfield.
Drive!  Goddamnit, drive!
Hey, what do you think you're --
You people really get me.  What are they putting in the water in that town?
Not dead.  Just very much retired.
 What the devil?!  Come in -- come in!
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
Don't tell me that the reviled Rasputin of Smith's Grove has grown complacent in his golden years.  I don't buy it for a single second, Dr. Loomis.
And in all these years, I've never known you to make house calls, Dr. Wynn.  Especially at this hour ...
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
But surely Rogers isn't --
Retiring.
Why -- congratulations!  I can think of no one better suited for the position.
Of course, I need a new Administrator. Someone who can bring new life -- and some old blood, if you'll pardon the expression -- back to our program ...
 We need you, Dr. Loomis.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change to finally make a difference.
Even after my stroke six years ago they practically had to hold a gun to my head to get me to retire.  Now things have changed. I've changed.  The ghosts have been buried. Why on earth would I want to dig them up again?
Seems to me there's at least one ghost that's still lurking in your closet.
God ... Help us, please ...
You have reached Haddonfield Emergency Services.  Due to severe weather conditions, all circuits are momentarily busy.  If this is not an emergency, please dial directly ...
For anyone who gives a flying circus, this is Harry Simms -- the light in your night, the love of your loins -- and I want to hear from more of you bogeyman believers out there.  So give me your best shot at 1-800-878-7274. That's 1-800-URTRASH!
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
 No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
Somebody help me!  Dr. Loomis, are you out there?  Can you hear me?
Are you all right, young lady?
No!!!
No -- NO!!!
Enough ...  ... of this ...  ... Michael Myers ...  ... shit!
 You stinkin' kids got three seconds to get the hell off my property!  One, two --
This is Hard Harry Simms harping on ya from the Big Apple.  Tonight's the night and the place to be is the First Annual Harvest Faire.  So come on out of your broom closets, 'Fielders, and bogey the night away with me.
Your mother?
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him.
Cancel all my appointments.  Get Dr. Loomis anything he needs -- files, tests, records of every treatment ever administered to a former patient of ours -- Michael Myers.
 Michael Myers?
That's right.  We think there's a very good chance he might still be alive.
 Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
Or what's left of him.
Bro', I knew Harry when we lived in the city. Don't worry -- he'll be there. We've got everything arranged.  Get with me tonight at the fair and I'll hook you up.  Peace.
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect.
 See what I'm talkin' about?
You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
 Cognitive Therapy and Emotional Disorders? What are they teaching in college these days? The art of going crazy?
 It's called psychology, Mom.  Living in this house is what's driving me crazy.
Who the hell told you to come live here in the first place?
I'd better get Danny to school.
She don't show her face for five years, then expects us to roll out the red carpet.  You think going to college is gonna make up for your mistakes, girl?
John, please don't --
Yo', just lay off her, Dad.
What the fuck --
Let's go, Danny.
Kara, wait.  John.  Can't we all just sit down?  Try to be a family for once?
I'm sorry, Mom.
That's it, Debra, keep slipping her the cash. While you're at it, why don't you just give her all our goddamn money?!
Stay away from her, you bastard.
 I only see one bastard in this house.
Dad!  Let her go!
John!  Stop it!  Stop it!
Kill him, Danny ... Kill him ...
You ever raise your hand to me again, I'll kill you, you understand?
Make way for the Hardin County Express.  Hey, where's Tim?  We're supposed to go over the list of events for tonight --
 He do that to you?
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
Pig.  What the hell happened this time?
 Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
How many times o I have to tell you? It's not about Halloween.  It's about being political. There are too many people with corn-cobs up their ass in this town telling us what we can and can't do.  If we want change, it's up to us to set an example.
I want her and that kid out of here tonight.
I thought inheriting your father's house ... the business ... moving out here might change things.  But you're still the same, John.  Kara has come home, and I'll be damned if I let you turn her away again.
Whatever happened to women in back?
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
 See you tonight, Mrs. Blankenship!
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Why?  You interested?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
Or horny.
Tim, do you always have to act like such an asshole?
Only when you're around to dump on ... Hey, chill, sis.  I'm just doggin' ya.
Speed kills, asshole!
Who is that ...
 I've got my pepper spray.
 Happy fuckin' Halloween.
Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
 It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
Bus 611 from Russellville now arriving.
Can I help you, sir?
Can you tell me if a bus arrived from Russellville last night?
Sure did.  About seven hours ago.  You lookin' for someone --
 Thank you.
Jesus ...
Okay, little guy.  You're okay.
 Chopper One to Smith's Grove.  We've got a visual.  Approximately ten miles due east of Haddonfield.
 What is that?
It's a sign.  He's come home.
Sir, you'll have to step back.
Please.  I need to see the sheriff.
Official business.
Wait here.
 You must be Sheriff Holdt.
As a matter of fact, I am.  And I take it you're the infamous Dr. Loomis.
I'd like to introduce you to Terence Wynn, the Chief of Staff at --
Smith's Grove.  They told me you'd be coming. Now I suggest you fly right on back to your crackpot asylum.  You people got no business in my town.
Michael Myers is my business.
I want you to listen and listen good, Loomis. Things have been quiet for six years and that's the way they're gonna stay.  The last thing we need is you spouting off your ghost stories.
I suppose it was a ghost that did all this.  A ghost who called the radio station last night. Maybe that same ghost is lying over there right now.
Sheriff!  She's alive!
Dear God ... Jamie!
Yo, check it out.  They've been lining up all night just to see Harry.  You lose your mind in that thing, Kara?
I can't find my term paper.
So copy someone else's.  I do it all the time. Works primo.
Give us victory or give us death.  See you tonight, Kara!
Thorn ...
Penetrating abdominal trauma.  Massive blood loss.  We've given her two units of O-negative stat and dextran.  BP sixty.  Pulse one-twenty ... Somehow she pulled through out there all night!
How can this girl still be alive?! Type and cross-match for another six units!  Get a CT scan and move her into surgery.  And get them out of here!
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
I need to see a doctor.
What seems to be the problem?
I-it's a baby -- my baby.  There's been -- been an accident.
What kind of an accident?
 Just get me a doctor right now!
There's nothing more you can do for her.
 I'll be right back.
Dr. Loomis!
Yes?
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
What do you know about Michael?
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
 No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
 Oh, God -- his cousins.  The Strodes. They're living in the Myers house!
 I gotta go.
Tommy, wait!
There you are.  Who was that boy?
An old friend.
Great.
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Strode.
 I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
 Who are you?
I've come to help your family.
Shhh.  Okay, okay, Kyle.  You like that name? Yeah, I think it suits you.
 This is worse for me than it is for you.
It's okay, big guy.  Don't you worry. I'm gonna take care of you.
Michael Myers was just six-years-old when he stabbed his sister to death in 1963.  Here in this house.  For the next fifteen years, I became obsessed with finding out what was living inside of him.  He was my lift's work and my ultimate failure.  I knew what he was but I never knew why.
There's a living force inside of him. Driving him.  And I fear that somehow it has been unleashed again.
Who's my next victim?
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
 What makes you think he'll come here again?
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
Double or nothing.
 Look how he sits there.  Little freak. Just like the bogeyman who used to live in his house.  Are you the bogeyman, Danny?
Kill him, Danny ... Kill him now ...
This force which drives him, which keeps him alive, comes from something more powerful -- more deadly than we can possibly imagine.  The embodiment of all that is evil.
You crazy little freak!!!
What should I do?
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
God ... this can't be true.
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
I'm coming.  Yes.  I'm coming.  Get ready.  I'm coming.  Oh, yes!  Yesss!!!
 Made ya look!!!  I'm coming, all right. And you better be there.  Tonight.  Let's do it together.
 Strode Realty.
John, it's me.  Something terrible has happened.
What is it this time?
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
 He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
 John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
 Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.
Trick-or-treat to you, too.
Hello?
We want the child ...
Oh, God ...
It's almost that time, all you kiddies and women with big -- hey, what rhymes with kiddies?  So let's count it down as we get down to the witching hour!
Mom, I'm home ... Hello?
Mom?
Mom? ... Danny?
 Mom?  Are you there?
Who the hell are you?
I-I'm your neighbor from across the street.  My name's Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.
What are you doing with my son? Where's my mother?
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
 Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
Tommy's my new friend.  We've been playing 'til you got home.  He knows all about dinosaurs.
My, God!  What have you done to him?
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
You stay away from him!
It wasn't Tommy!  It was the voice man.
I want you to listen very carefully to everything I'm about to tell you.
Please -- don't let him do this to me.
We're not going to hurt you, Jamie.  He chose you.  Now it's time.
Please, Michael ... Help me.
Your work is done, Jamie.
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
That's what worries me.
Hellllo, Haddonfield!!!
 There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
 Any word on the location of the Strodes?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
I'm warning you, Loomis -- stay out of my way. You may have had free reign when Ben Meeker was sheriff, God rest his soul, but I'm in charge now.  And I'm not about to stand by and watch you turn this night into some kind of sadistic witch hunt.
Sam, I just got word from the hospital. You'd better get over there right away.
 What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
I'll meet you over there.
Quiet around here tonight, huh, Mrs. B.?
 Do you mind telling me what this is all about? Tim and Beth are waiting for us.
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
 You can't expect us to stay here --
I want you to watch your house.  You can see everything from this window.
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Him.
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
 Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
Shhh.  It's okay, Kyle.  Just give me one more --  -- second.  There you go, big guy.
God, what's wrong with him?
Here.  Let me try.
 There.  All it takes is a mother's touch.
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this.
 It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
It's a rune ... Thorn.
Jamie ... I failed you again.  I never should have left you.
 Now will you do something?!  How many more innocent people have to die?!
Don't do this to yourself, Sam.  Let's go. Come on.
Dr. Loomis?
What is it?
I'm very sorry ...
You let it get to her.  How could you?
Dr. Loomis, there's something else you should know.  During surgery, we discovered that Jamie's uterus was hemorrhaging.  We found this.  It's placental fluid.
God in heaven.  You don't tell me she was --
I estimate she gave birth no more than a few hours before the attack.
Then where's her baby?
I think I may already know ...
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
Halloween.
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
 Where are you going?
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
Oh, God -- Where's Danny? Kara flies down the hall, the baby in her arms.  Tommy moves out right behind her.
Danny?!  Danny!
Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
 Danny, don't ever walk off without telling me where you're going!
The voice.  He hears the voice.  Just like the other little boy who used to live in that house.
Take the kids upstairs, lock the door and wait for me.  And Kara, whatever you do -- don't go back to your house.
... Pretty woman, walking down the street ... Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet.
Damn kid ... this is my house ...
 What the fuck ...  ... Debra, open this goddamn door before I break it down!  You got to three ...  ... One ... Two ...  ... Two and a half ...
Debra -- I'm home!
 Work all day and not even any supper ...
All right ... You can all come out now ...
What is this shit?
So this is the game you wanna play. Fine.  Go ahead.  Keep it up all night ...
Is that you, you little brat?  Danny?!
 When I get my hands on you, kid, you're gonna wish you were never born!
 Oh, I'm scared.  I'm really scared.
What the hell --
 I'm here with Tim and Beth -- the organizers of tonight's event.  How does it feel knowing you've finally pulled Halloween out of the closet?
 Yo, Harry, it's great!  And having you here with us is dope.  Totally raw. You're the ultimate juice!
I'll remember that the next time my wife tells me I didn't make her climax.
 What Tim means is that we've taken a firm stand against censorship.  Not only for Haddonfield, but for every town in the nation.  Our generation will not let the powers-that-be control our minds, dictate what clothes we wear, what music we listen to, or what holidays we celebrate.
 Have you ever considered running for public office?
Mrs. Blankenship, what did you mean about the little boy who used to live across the street?
 Mrs. Blankenship, please.  This is important!
He heard the voice.  Same as your boy hears.
What voice?  What are you talking about?
The voice that spoke to Michael Myers. The one that told him to kill his family.
I'm coming for you, Danny ... I'm coming.
Stop that man!  Stop him!!!
Throw down the gun!  Now!!!
Stop that man!  He's the one!
Who's gettin' busted?
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
 Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
 We can light our own tree at home.
I was baby-sitting for him that night. Little Mikey Myers from across the street.  That's when the voice told him what to do.  Same as his great- grandfather.
His what?!
Eighteen-ninety-five.  A hundred years ago to this night.  All Hallows Eve. Murdered his family in that very same house.  Then the townspeople burned him alive.  Our mother always told us when we were children, 'Don't go near the Myers house.'  We never did.
Wait!  This boy is being placed in my custody.
What are you trying to pull now, Loomis?
Uncuff him!  This is a matter of life or death.
You'd better as fuck have an explanation for this, Doctor.
Dr. Loomis, there's something you should know --
I know enough already.  Just shut your mouth and take me to that baby.
Oh my God --
Tommy!
Get them out of there!  Get out!!!
Oh, God -- Kara!!!
Mommy, I'm scared.
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
Promise?
 I promise.
Beth, are you in there?
 Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
 Guess so ...
What if your parents come home?
Then they can watch.
Aren't you gonna answer that?
Answer what?
 What if it's Kara?
Fine.  You answer it.  I'll make friends with my soap on a rope.
 Hello?
 Mom -- Who is this?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Is Tim there?
He's in the bathroom.
I'm across the street.  I can see you. Beth, I want you to listen to me.  Get Tim and get out of that house.  Right now.
Come to me, Danny ... Come to me.
Kara, what the hell is going on?
Beth, look out!  There's someone in the room!  He's right behind you!
Danny, no!!!
 Danny?
 Come on ... Danny, please.
Danny, run!!!
Danny, come to Mommy.
Mommy!!!
Danny, help me!
Come to me, Danny ... Come to me.
Danny!!!
Please!  Open the door!
The baby -- where's the baby?!
Please!  Somebody help us!
Help us please!!!
Get them upstairs.  Now!
Where's the baby?!
He's gone.
 Who else knew I had the baby?!
No one.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
 Wynn!!!
 Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
No!!!
Mommy!  Please help me!
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Kara, no!
Danny, no ... please ...
Mrs. Blankenship -- Oh, God -- Hurry. We have to --
Good evening, Dr. Wynn.  Your -- appointment is waiting inside.
What is this all about?  Remove those!
Where's the child?
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
 Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
This is madness, Wynn.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
It was you.
 Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Why did you take Jamie?
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Jamie's baby ...
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
Samhain.
And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
 I know you have more questions, my friend, and there's so much more for you to try to make sense of.
Look at him.  So silent, yet so deadly. He moves when I tell him to.  Act on my impulses.  Feels what I feel.
 Michael -- Rise.
 Michael -- Pain.
 Michael -- Kill.
You've created a monster.
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
 We're not the only ones, you know. There are many believers -- generous contributors to our church.  You'd be amazed to know how far it reaches.
Holy shit ...
 Behind, Disciples of Thorn!  The final sign!  The birth of the heretic child, delivered unto us on the eve of our great Feast of the Sun ... as I have foreseen it.
Spirits and powers of the flame, attend and witness this ritual.  Bear our gifts to Thorn.  Open us to the path of Darkness.  By these runes transform us. Open our eyes and show us the Chosen One to whom we offer this sacrifice of Innocent Blood.
Danny!!!
Strong and fierce Thorn, Thundered, by thy hammer we summon thee and offer this sacrifice of innocent blood.  Let thy Darkness descend on your son. Danny.  Lord of the Dead.
 Kill for him, Danny ... Kill for him.
Michael, please.  You can make him stop.  You remember, don't you?
 Remember what he did to you that night. What his voice told you to do.  You can stop it, Michael.  Stop the voice forever.
Kill him, Danny.  Kill him!
Danny, don't listen!  The voice isn't real!
Kill him, Danny!  You feel the rage inside!  You are Thorn!
No!!!
Stay away, Sam.
Leave the boy.  Take me.
 Good-bye, Dr. Loomis.
Mommy!!!
Danny!!!
Die, Michael.  In the name of God, die!
This way!
What now?!
 Wait a minute ...
Come on!
 It's not working!
 Someone's controlling it!
How will we ever find him?
