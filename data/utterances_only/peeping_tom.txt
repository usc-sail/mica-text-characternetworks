It'll be two quid...
Hey, you peeping...
What paper are you from?
I beg your pardon?
What paper are you from?
The Observer.
You're late!
Sorry, sir.
 Hold on, Mark.
Mark... I've a question for you.
Which magazines sell the most copies?
Those with girls on the front covers - and no front covers on the girls.
Exactly!... And it's just the same with the work you do for me.
Look busy.
The Times, please.
Certainly, sir.
And The Telegraph.
Certainly, sir - anything else?
I... er... have been told by a friend that you... er... have some views for sale?
What sort of views, sir?
Well, er...
This sort, sir?
I, er... how much each?
Five shillings, sir.
I'll take this one... and, er... this one... and, er... how much would the lot be?
To you - five pounds, sir...
Tell you what, sir. Four pounds ten - and I'll throw in The Times and Telegraph... how's that?
Well, er... thank you very much.
Let me wrap it for you, sir.
Shall I put you on our mailing list?
Oh no! But I'll look in again...
By all means, sir.
He won't be doing the crossword tonight!
 Those pictures he chose... were all yours!  This is yours!
 And this is yours too...
And that's what I want to talk to you about. It's a clever picture - because you're a clever lad... but, Mark...  It's all face.
I don't want to hurt your feelings, son - but if people want the Mona Lisa they go to the National Gallery.
The Louvre.
Well, wherever they go, they don't come here... so no more of this fancy stuff...
... now get upstairs - the girls are waiting... and so is a bonus if you give me what I want.
Thank you, sir.
 What do you do with all your money?
Buy cameras.
Well look who's here! Cecil Beaton!
Come on, sonny... make us famous.
Did you read about that girl who was murdered last night?
The same thing nearly happened to me!
When?
Last night! I went out with my boyfriend... We're getting married next month... trouble was my fiance saw us.
can you fix it so the bruises don't show?
Well, can you?
...think so, Milly.
Then be quick about it, sonny! I'm freezing.
There he goes again! What have you got under there? A girlfriend?
I suppose you have a girlfriend?
No, Milly.
Hear that, Lorraine? He's available.
Raise your head, please - and look at the sea.
What sea?
What sea?
I just wanted that puzzled look.
Oh, did you? Well if you want it again, I'll think of you!
You're a puzzle and a half.
This is a spare time job for you, isn't it?
Yes, Milly.
Well, what do you do for a living?
Take pictures.
This sort?
No, Milly.
Don't you like this sort?
No, Milly.
Well what sort do you like?
I may show you - one day.
That'll be a treat, I'm sure.
That's all, Milly.
Oh no, sonny! Now take one I can show my mother.
Think of her then.
On the house.
Some house! Hope it falls on his ruddy earhole!
It's your turn now, love...
 ... it's her first time.
Come on, love. Don't be shy.
He said... you needn't photograph my face!
I want to.
I suppose you'll fix my bruises too?
I want to...
What about the customers?
You needn't be shy... of me... it's my first time too.
Yours?
In front of eyes... like...
...eyes... as full of...
Lorraine - let my camera tell you.
 Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday... dear Helen
happy birthday to you.
Twenty-one today, She's twenty-one today, She's got the key of the door, She's never been twenty-one before.
You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens.
May I?
Look!
It's that chap from upstairs.
I'll ask him in...
Excuse me!
I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs?
... but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you! So hello!
I'm Helen Stephens.
I'm having a party - and the other tenants are there...  And a few friends. We'd like you to join us.
Mark...
Pardon?
I'm Mark...
Hallo, Mark.
Please come in... you'll meet the others who live here, and...
Thank you, but... work.
Oh...
Well, I hope to keep it going for hours yet... so when you've finished why not look in?
...Mark?
Darling, your cake - everyone's waiting.
Thank you.
Happy Birthday.
...minute...
I hope I'm not disturbing you?
I knew you wouldn't come down... so I've brought you this.
Thank you...
... very much...
I mustn't keep you from your work
I'd like to offer you a drink.
Thank you, Mark.
I haven't one.
I'd adore some water.
a hostess can't drink water at her own party, it looks like a hint to the guests.
Will you... would you... like to come in?
Yes, Mark...
There's milk... if you'd like some?
Very much... if you can spare it?
Yes.
Thank you, Mark...
This is a pleasant room... and you've another inside?
Yes.
How long have you lived here?
All my life.
I was born in this house Oh?
It's my father's.
Do you mean I've at last found out who our landlord is? Your father?
Well - no... he's dead!
I'm the landlord.
YOU?
Yes.
But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
I haven't.
I meant...
I know.
It's his house - and I'll never sell it... but I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms.
... if I charge too much, tell me and I'll tell the agents.
The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others or you'll have no peace.
Peace...?
Mark, what do you do?
 Most of the time, I work in a film studio.
On the photographic side, I'll bet.
I hope to be a film director... very soon.
How exciting.
I have some spare time jobs... as well.
To do with photography?
More milk?
No thank you... to do with photography?
Yes... to do with photography...
When I came in were you looking at some films?
Yes.
Of yours?
Yes.
I'd like to see them...
Know I'm being rude... but I really would like to see them...  ...it would be a birthday present... from you to me.
Would it?
Yes, Mark.
Oh...
But I suppose you're too busy?
Will you... would you... like to see them now?
Thank you...
I'll... go first.
This is so... well - so many things... but above all - it's so...
...completely unexpected!
Is all of it yours?
Yes.
I mean... is it designed by you? Furnished by you? Tell me about this room.
It belonged to my father
What was he?
Scientist...
Then this equipment was his?
No...
Sold his to buy it...
But it seems to be so... technical.
If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at.
Don't know what to show you?
Well... what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
All right!
This is the first... twenty-first birthday present... I'll ever have given.
It's the first I've ever asked for...
Mark, what a beautiful child.
Who is he?
Me
Of course it is!  Then who took this film?
 My Father.
What a wonderful idea...
You'll be able to show it to your own chi...
You must have had a bad dream...
...but what was that light?  ...The camera, I suppose?
Whatever are you after?
Naughty boy I hope you were spanked!
... but, Mark... what a strange thing for your father to photograph.
Switch off?
No.
No.
Tony!
Me, Mrs. Stephens?
I want a word with you.
I hate people who chatter in films - but there's so much I want to ask.
 Again?
Mark, this isn't some kind of jo...
 No, Helen.
Mark, whatever is that?
What are you...
wanted to photograph you... watching...
No, Mark!
No!
help me to understand this... this nightmare...
All right... now look... Mark - what was all that about?
... that was a lizard, wasn't it? Or a...
Liz...
Well how did it get there?... How did it get there Mark?...  Was it a pet?
Not mine...
Won't you try to explain?
You'd better go!
I like to understand what I'm shown!
What was your father trying to do?... Photographing you at nigh...
better go...
Mark... what is this?
I am saying... goodbye... my mother...
 He... photographed... that...?
Yes.
...and this!
...her funeral!
...and this!
...her burial!
...and this!
Mark, who is that?
Her successor.
Suc-?
He married her... six weeks after... the previous sequence.
She filmed... what comes now.
Is that your father?
The morning that he left for his honeymoon.
What is he doing?
Giving me a present...
What was it?
Can't you guess?
A camera...
Switch it off!
Switch it off, Mark!
So he was a scientist?
What kind of scientist, Mark?
Biologist.
What was he trying to do to you?
Mark!...
What was he trying to do to you?
Watch me... grow up...
He wanted a record of a growing child... complete in every detail - if such a thing were possible - and he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me... at all times...
I never knew... the whole of my childhood... one moment's privacy...
And those lights in your eyes?... and that - thing?
He was interested ... in the reactions of the nervous system... to fear...  Fear?
Fear?
Fear.
Especially fear in children - and how they react to it.
I think he learned a lot... from me... I'd wake up... screaming... sometimes... and he'd be there... taking notes... and pictures... and I'm sure good came of it... for some people... He was brilliant.
A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed - and good comes of it?
I don't know... if he did... but if he did... he'll have learned something of value...
If only about lizards!  Mark - it sounds to me as if your father was...
He founded clinics.
He sounds completely...
He was famous! Professor A. N. Lewis... three clinics.
Why do you still live in his house... and watch his films?
They helped make me... what I am.
A photographer? It's no wonder, is it? But you still haven't shown me anything you've photographed!
Will you?
One day...
Excuse me, but...
Oh, there you are, Helen.
The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if...
I'm coming.
I wish you'd join us.
Thanks... work.
I hope that you...
... have a sweet tooth!
Thank you... for my present.
Good night, old boy.
OK. Print that one!
All right, everyone! Back at two!
Mark?
Hallo...
Were you spotted?
Don't think so.
 Is it tonight?
Yes.
Mark...
Yes?
You're sure we won't be caught?
Not if you do as I tell you.
I will, I promise.
You haven't... said anything... to anyone?
Of course not.
Good... like some cake?
Thank you.
Mark... I want to be quite clear about this...
Tonight, when the studio's empty... I'm to come back-and you're going to give me a film test... right?
Right.
You'll then print the film - so I can show it to my agent and anyone else who matters - right?
Right.
Mark...
I've been offered film tests before... but I haven't liked the terms.
There aren't any.
Then why are you doing this? Risking your job and...
Not just for you... Viv... I have an agent too - and I want to show him what I can do... I want to direct...
 There's someone coming.
Hallo - lousy morning's work, wasn't it?
Yes.
Thought I saw you talking to somebody...
I was learning my lines.
Didn't know you had any...
Want a drink? Dutch?
Later... perhaps.
Be seeing you
Mark...
Yes?
 You didn't mind me asking?
No, more cake?
No... you want to direct... more badly than anything don't you?
Don't you, Mark?
I want... to photograph... the impossible...
What is impossible?
Something... that has never been photographed before.
What?
You really want to know...?
Very much, especially if there's a part for me.
I want... to photograph a murder... while it's being committed.
No part for me then.
But that... isn't enough.
Is this a new script?
I want... to frighten... someone... to death... and photograph... their expression of fear...
Mark! What's this story called?
That is something... he never photographed...
Who?
Who is he, Mark?
Anyone.
No one could... they'd be caught!
I wouldn't care... if I had my picture.
Besides, how would you frighten anyone to death?
There's a way.
Well, what?
There's a way.
You'd better not tell me! I'll be scared to death tonight as it is!
Back on the set - shall I go first?
Please.
What are you doing?
Getting into practice.
See you tonight!
See you tonight!
Would you enquire if our leading lady is ready to start leading.
Miss Diane Ashley, please!... Miss Diane Ashley, please!...
How are you, Sparks? Chippy? Bob?
Hallo, Diane...
How are you, Tom? Roger?
Hallo, Diane...
How are you, Phil?... Mark?
Hallo, Miss Ashley.
 How are you, Pete...?
Hi, Di!
Darling, you've only been playing this part for three weeks, so in case you haven't yet had a chance to read the script...
... may I remind you that you're a girl with an irresistible impulse!
a kleptomaniac! Who cannot help stealing... Get inside her, Diane!... What - in all the world - do you most want to steal?
The limelight!
We'll run the scene where you catch sight of the store detective and faint... Where's the girl who plays the bystander?
How are you?
Hallo, Diane...
Positions, everyone!
Hit that floor with a thud!
D.J. insists on realism!
...it's a wonderful subject, D.J.... Paramount wants it, M.G.M. wants it, Columbia wants it.
But is it commercial?
Danny Angel wants it!
Are those budgets ready? Well bring 'em in.
Send me a memo - we'll discuss it next week.
There's an error!  The total should be a hundred and fifty thousand pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence - not thirteen and ninepence... That could mean the difference between profit and loss on a first feature!
Sorry, D.J.
Any units working late tonight?
Only one, sir. Night exteriors on the lot. The Elephant with two...
That animal needs a stick of dynamite!
Remind me to pay them a visit tonight.
Yes, D.J.
Now, Miss Simpson... take a memo to all department heads...
In light of the new economy drive...
Again, please... and, darling...
... just this once... will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and try to look as if you're stunned...?
Say one kind word - and I would be!
 Positions, everyone!
If I have to faint once more I shall faint!
Cut! How was that?... (thumbs up all round - with one exception) Mark?
Print it!
That's it, boys and girls . . . wrap it up! Night-night everyone! Baden puts his arm round Diane's shoulder.
How are you, darling?
Catching the bus?
Not tonight... meeting someone... for a drink.
Wanted to discuss the film at the Everyman... Tomorrow then?
I hope so.
Good night, Mark.
Good night.
Greetings... lousy afternoon's work, wasn't it? Who wants a lift to town?
In what?
colleague's car... there's room for two on my lap - three at a pinch.
Which is what we'd get.
You, Viv?
No, thanks... I've a date... at the Local.
Us two then?
I'm game... might as well get pinched in a car as squeezed in a tube.
I'm to remind you to pay a surprise visit tonight to The Elephant with...
Good night, D.J.
 Mark...?
Mark...?
Mark...?
Mark!
Listen... we must...
Where are you?
Here, Viv...
You frightened me!
Now listen... they're working late on the lot.
I know. They're branched off this stage - I'm using their juice.
We must call it off... someone's bound to see us.
They might...  ... but they won't interrupt us while we're filming... I've put the red light on.
You've what?...
Put the...
Then they'll know someone's here.
They won't come in.
They'll wait outside... what's the difference?
The difference is... a perfect film...
... have waited... a long time... for this... and so have you ... no one... must interrupt it.
We'll be caught.
What does that matter?
Matter!
You stand to lose... a job as an extra... I stand to lose... nothing.
...the results must be so perfect... that the risks don't count...
So perfect... that even he ...  ... even he... would say...
Who Don Jarvis!?
Oh! He'd say: (imitating the great man's voice) Sign on the dotted line, kiddies! You can use my pen, but bring your own ink! (her excitement is growing) Mark... if you're sure it's worth it?
It's time to find out, Viv...
Come on! Get hot! (she accents the rhythm)
You belong there...
I do feel alone in front of it...  I suppose stars never do?
They feel alone without it... (he looks in the eyepiece)
... and the great ones... feel alone... all the time...
Then I'm great, boy! What is it you want me to act? (she strikes an attitude a, la Rabbins)
Being frightened to death?
You remembered?
Yes - and I'll have a go!
I've been wondering all the afternoon how you'd do it!  I'll bet you've thought of a wonderful twist! (she does a wonderful twist)
What are you doing?
Building us a set.
Why not pull the studio down while you're about it? They can only hang you once.
Exactly.
If only Don Jarvis could see me now!
If only I could see Don Jarvis now!
I warn you, Mark - I'm hysterical... I'd rather act dying of laughter, if it's all the same to you...
So he did it again! Now you tell one.
Half a mo...
One lump or two?
As the starlet said to the casting director...
 What are you doing?
Be patient, Viv... it's going to be worth it.
Oh well! I've stood alone in front of a studio camera! That's more than most have.
Ever stood... behind one?
No.
Help yourself.
 I can see you, Mark... perfectly!
Good...
Yes, sir! I'll bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business! . . . (beating time with her feet)
I've lost you!
I'll be back.
Welcome, stranger!
What are you doing?
Photographing you photographing me...
 Mark, you're brilliant...
Lost you again!
Never mind.
I'm ready now, Viv...
Go and stand on that cross, will you?
 Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir.
...and here's one of the wife and nipper...
Am I supposed to imagine someone is going to put me in there?
Yes, Viv...
Mark - I hope I won't let you down... I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me - but... I just don't feel frightened! Wouldn't it be better if I just did my number?
 Later.
Oh all right! I could do anything - I feel so relaxed - and that's due to you... You're so at home with that camera you make me feel at home too... you have it in you, boy!
Ready, Viv?
 Well-I'll try -
But what... would... frighten me to death? (looking appealingly into camera) Set the mood for me, Mark...
Well...
Imagine someone... coming towards you... who's going to kill you - regardless of consequences...
A madman?
Yes - but he knows it... and you don't... and just to kill you... isn't enough for him.
But how would he frighten me to?
Stay there, Viv... you're... just right.
I can't imagine what you've thought of!
Suppose this... were one of his weapons...
Smoking on duty!
Come with me!
That..?
Yes... that would be frightening!
But... there's something else...
Well? What is it?
 That...?
 Mark... take it...
... away!
MARK - YOU!
And that, darling, is the end of the news! Unless you want the football results?
No thank you.
What else can I read you?
The label on this whisky bottle! Are you sure it says seventy per cent proof?
Certain.
They're bigger liars than the press!
Is that your last tonight?
I doubt it.
Your last but one?
Don't haggle.
 Toss me double or nothing?
Done!
Heads.
Bad luck, darling.
Huh.
What are you looking at?
The ceiling!
Wondering if that young man is home?
Yes.
Well he is... I heard him come in... four paragraphs ago.
Do you like him?
Yes, darling.
Why?
He has a quality...
 Wish this had.
... and I think he could help me.
With your photographs?
Yes...
Helen...
Yes?
 It doesn't matter.
 Mummy, what's worrying you?
The price of whisky.
What else?
What else matters?
Don't you like Mark?
Haven't met him.
You don't like him! Now why not?
I distrust a man who walks quietly.
He's shy!
His footsteps aren't! They're stealthy...
Now darling.
Are you going up to him?
May I?
We both have the key of the door... Mine needs oiling - and yours needs exercise... Off you go.
Thank you.
remember that you lost the toss.
Helen...
Yes, darling?
If you're back in five minutes... I won't even finish this.
Done!
Who is it?
Helen...
 Come in, Helen!
Would you... please... wait in there?... Developing.
Mother heard you come in - so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed ...
Are you sure this is conven...
Won't be long!
Hallo.
Hallo, Mark...
I hope you don't mind - is it a tape-recorder?
Yes.
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance... but, Mark, I very much want to...
Happy birthday.
Mark! That's very sweet of you - but really.
It isn't much... I don't know anything about... presents for twenty-one... but I saw it this morning... so... please.
 Thank you...
It's beautiful...
I like the design... More milk?
More?... No, thank you, Mark... and I really appreciate this... I'm going to put it on now.
There?... Or there?...
The first place...
I think so too!...
I am keeping you.
No... I promise.
Mark, I'm here for some advice.
From me?  Please...
... I work in a public library - in the children's section... I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me...
In my spare time... I write.
What's embar...
I write stories for children... but so did Grimm... Hans Andersen... Lewis Carroll...
Had any published?
Some short stories.
I'd like to read...
I learned today... that my first book... has been accepted! ... For publication in the spring...
But that's wonderful... what's it about?
A magic camera - and what it photographs...
Whatever made you... think of that?
I'll tell you one day - I promise...
Well what does it photograph?
I'll tell you that too - but, Mark... this is the problem... The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes - but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and suggest drawings... but I don't agree.
No - nothing's impossible.
was hoping you'd say that! There must be photographs - however difficult to take - and I was wondering, Mark - if you'd...
Oh yes.
discuss it with me.
take them.
Mark - I can't ask you to do that...
I mean... the publisher's mightn't agree.
I'd take them... for you.
Yes but... the money.
There are some things... which I photograph... for nothing.
I didn't mean to offend you.
Offend?
Helen... if you knew what it meant... for something to happen to me... that I don't have to make happen... it's like... you've given me a twenty-first birthday...
What does your camera photograph?
Mark - I must go... I just wanted to know... if you'd talk it over with me.
When please?
That's up to you.
Helen ... I don't know much about... dinner out... but would you come with me?
Thank you.
Thank you.
When?
Oh...
What's the matter?
It had better be soon...
Are you going away?
Almost for certain! ...
Oh... well you suggest when.
Are you free... tomorrow night?
Yes.
I hope I am!
I'll understand if you're not.
I'll try to be - I'll try my hardest to be.
Thank you for listening... and for my present.
and for mine.
Good night, Mark... (turning to the door)
Good night... Helen...
Looking for a trunk?
I'd like to see that one.
No - no - no - we must get some comedy into this...!
We'll retake it this morning...
 I'll take it.
I want some comedy in this scene...
Instead of taking the first trunk you see, I want you, darling... to ask for a blue trunk - and when he brings it to you, to ask for a red one - and when he brings that, to ask for a white one... (turns to the Assistant) And you, Michael... get the trunks one by one - growing more and more fed up - and we'll end on a gag which I'll think of in a minute - all right?
I don't feel it!
Don't feel it! Do it!
 Positions, everyone!
Anyone seen Vivian?
Who?
The red-headed bystander - Viv.
 Never mind - I'm cutting her out of this scene... Let's run it.
 Quiet, everyone!
Can I interest you in a trunk?
Thank you...  I'd like to see that one...
Certainly, madam...
It's beautifully fitted - 
I'd like to see one in red.
Certainly, madam.
... do you have one in white?
Certainly, madam.
Do you have one in blue?
Certainly, madam...
The silly bitch! She's fainted in the wrong scene...
Excuse me, Chief.
Mm?
We pass my house when we reach the bypass. Would you mind if I drop off for a minute?
 To collect your kid's autograph book?
Yes, Chief!... If the nipper hears where I've been...
 All right, Dawson - anything to help the Sergeant... (stares down at the folder) ... and it's about time the Sergeant helped me - we're getting nowhere with this.
What about that man the landlady passed?
She couldn't describe him - except to say that he was carrying something that she couldn't see.
That's a help.
Sergeant, I've been on the force thirty odd years... and I have never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's...  What was it she saw?
Surely, Chief... a man coming at her - with a sharp weapon.
I'm familiar with that kind of terror. This is something new to me... but what?
...now take a look at how we found her.
How much longer must we wait in here?
Till the police arrive... D.J.'s orders.
and when she opened that trunk... and I saw what was inside... my dears - I nearly fainted with her - (he runs a delicate hand across a delicate forehead) and do you know what horrified me most?
D.J. says not to discuss it.
Any more sauce from D.J. and I shall refuse to sign for seven years! My dears... that poor girl's expression.
 Chief, it's exactly the...
I know... (he closes the trunk quickly. Quietly) ... don't say anything.  Well, sir... we shall probably have to interview everyone at the studio, so we'd better plan a campaign that won't interfere too much with your productions.
 Thank you, Chief Inspector... if you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.
Oh, we do sir. (his eyes are on the trunk)
If I may have your attention, please.
The police wish to interview each of you individually... after which you will be at liberty to leave.
There will, of course, be no shooting today... but work will be resumed, as usual, tomorrow... with, I hope, all of you present.
I look to you to give the police your fullest cooperation. (he turns abruptly and leaves')
Well now... let's get ourselves organized... (taking a piece of paper from his pocket) We don't want to keep you cooped up in here, so we've worked out a timetable... We'll talk to the artists first, then the technicians in this order...
...she said she didn't want a lift - because she had a call to make locally.
Did she say where?
No, sir... and when I left, she was still in the dressing room.
I see... let's have a look at this dressing room, shall we?
Yes, sir ...
Hallo, Mark...
Hallo.
Hey, I don't think you ought to do that!
Sorry, sir.
 Do what?
Make me famous. Some chap was giving me a screen test
That's where she sat.  Inspector.
And whoever did it must be...
You're next.
I've been watching you...
Oh?
Have you been filming those policemen?
Yes, I've a few quite interesting shots of them - it's a chance I never expected!
A chance for what?
To photograph... an investigation... or as much of it as I can.
What on earth for?
It will complete a documentary I'm making.
documentary?
What's it about?
I'd rather not tell you till it's finished. And it soon will be ...
But suppose they catch you?
Oh they will - they look very efficient.
Don't you mind?
No.
But they might confiscate your camera.
I'm afraid they will! But by then... I'll have finished with it.
I don't...
You, Mark?
Thanks...
Mark, hadn't you better leave that with me?
No, John.
I'd look after it.
I'm sure of that - but I'd like to photograph them while they're questioning me.
I don't suppose they'll let me.
Mark, are you potty?
Yes, do you think they'll notice?
Don't get into any trouble for heaven's sake  I want to discuss that film at the Everyman...
Yes... I'd like that...
Mark Lewis - focus-puller... Whatever that may be?
Come in.
Mr. Lewis?
Yes, sir...
I'm Chief Inspector Gregg and this is Sergeant Miller. Grab a chair.
Ah! My photographer.
I've brought the camera in case you want to take the film away.
That's all right, Mr. Lewis - as long as we don't appear at the Odeon next week in place of the cartoon.
Thank you, sir.
Well now; have you anything to tell us?
Don't think so, sir.
Did you know the girl?
Yes, sir...
How well?
Mainly by sight.
When did you see her last?
Yesterday afternoon - when we broke...
Speak to her?
Called out good night - don't know if she heard?
What did you do then?
Took sqme shots, sir - for a film I'm making.
Oh... where?
All over the place, sir... it's a documentary.
Anyone with you?
No, sir. Just my camera.
What time did you arrive home, Mr. Lewis?
About ten... ten-thirty...
Anyone see you?
Yes... the people downstairs.
I see.
Sergeant Miller - Right, I'll tell him...
The doctor's finished his examin...
...wants to see you -
Right.  That'll be all for the moment, Mr. Lewis - thank you.
 Thank you, sir ...
Wait a minute.
direct me to that set of yours, will you? I'd probably end on location.
I'll take you there, sir. 
Thanks. (he glances at the Sergeant) Carry on with the interviews, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
 I warned him to be careful!
I think I can find my way now...
...thanks for the escort
No doubt at all... wounds were caused by the same instrument...
... both women... subjected to the most violent shock...
What sort of shock?
...still cannot determine - but look!
Quiet, everyone.  Please...
I thought I heard a putty cat!
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands, and if we don't get him quickly there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the Commissioner. So let's hurry things up, shall we?
Sorry, Chief!
she was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film The Walls Are Closing In, starring Diane Ashley.
a spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise, that her role was to have been built up... All work at the studio ceased today as a tribute to her memory!
Mark is in films, isn't he?
Yes, darling... It is reliably...
I wonder if he knew her?
I'll ask him tonight...
Is he taking you out?
If he's free.
That's very chivalrous of him. Where's he taking you?
I've no idea - and I don't suppose he has...
Which studio does he work at?
I'll ask him.
If he's free.
I'll bring him in and introduce you if...
I feel I know him.
Now how can you?
He's here.
Why don't we make him a present of the window? He practically lives there!
How did you know where he was standing?
The back of my neck told me... the part that I talk out of!
Hallo...
Free?
Yes.
Good! So am I...
I'd like you to come in for a moment - and meet my mother.
Yes, please...
Darling, this is Mark... Mark, my mother.
How do you do... Mrs. Stephens...
Hallo, Mark.
Have you been running, young man?
Yes...  ... didn't want to be late for Helen.
Thank you, Mark - You deserve a drink for that! What would you like?
Nothing - thank you... very much...
Darling, I've left your supper in the...
Tell me young man... Which studio do you work at?
Chipperfield Studio . . .
And that poor girl... where did she work?
At Brookwood.
We were wondering if you knew her?
No - No, I didn't...
A pity. I do like first-hand information.
Oh, well - I mustn't keep you gossiping after you've run all the way from - Where?
The station.
Darling, may I tell you about your supper?
No... go and be told about yours! (she takes Mark's hand) Goodbye, Mark... I expect we shall meet again.
I hope so - Goodbye... (He turns to the door)
Darling, we forgot to toss.
Supper's laid out in the kitchen.
If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it!
We'll be early! Good night, darling.
Good night...
Mark...
Yes, Helen?
I want to ask you something rather personal...
How long is it since you've gone out without that?
Without what?
Your camera...
Oh...
I... don't think I know?
Exactly. I've never seen you without it... but are you going to need it tonight?
Well are you? And if so... shall I bring some work with me too?
I'm not going to need it tonight!
Good - then give it to me!
...It'll be quite safe - I'll put it away for you.
 No!
Then take it upstairs - if you can't trust me with it...
I trust you.
Then look...
...let's put it in here.
Come in - and see for yourself.
We'll put it in here - and lock it.
This... was my mother's room.
Was it, Mark?...
I am being tactless, aren't I? ... It's just that... I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and - but you bring it with you if you want to.
Thank you...
You...
Thank you.
I feel...
Yes?
Can't describe it! Could only photograph it -
Shall I tell you what I feel?
Yes.
Famished!
Good!
There's a small place round the corner... It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
Is it?
Yes... there aren't too many open then.
No - it sounds fun.
This way.
I adore new restaurants...
Where is this restaurant?
Round the corner...
Know much about films?
Come on then...
Thank you.
Sorry, young man, Helen's out.
Oh!
With Mark - from upstairs.
Oh!
You can stay and talk to me - if you like?
Well I...
Know much about films?
Well...
Or film studios?
No, I...
Where's Chipperfield Studios?
Chipperfield, I suppose...
There's a phone book outside... Look up the number, will you? And see if you can get it.
Certainly... and then I must go to my room.
Granted.
I like this place! And this dinner!
...thank you, Mark...
Are you ready to talk about your book?
I'm ready to talk about you...
It won't take a second - and it's best to have it said.
Carrying a camera is only one of your habits, isn't it, Mark?
... when you stared at that couple, you were like the little boy on that film you showed me... looking over the wall at something he shouldn't see. But Mark - you're strong enough now to lift that child off the wall... aren't you?
... aren't you?
I'll try to be.
Will you, Mark?... Will you really?
Yes...
Lecture finished...
When your book's published - will you go on working in a library?
Yes, Mark... in case, one day, a child comes in and asks for it!
I'll come in.
I'm not popular with my customers! They ask me for horror comics - and I take their sticky hands and drag them to where there are books!
... and do you know, Mark, waiting for them to come in next time and ask for books... is as exciting... as a horror comic...
What does your magic camera photograph?
People...
Yes?...
It's owned by a little boy who is terrified of grown-ups... but when he looks in his magic camera he sees grown-ups as they were when they were children... and he isn't frightened any longer.
... and one day he gives his camera away to a little boy who is even more frightened of grown-ups than he was - and do you know what he finds?
... that when he looks at grown- ups without his camera he can still see them as they were when they were children!  And that means that he's grown up himself...
What made you think of this story?
You did!
... I looked out of my window - and saw you going off to work carrying that camera like a little boy with a satchel... and an idea came... so thank you...
I'd like to think... I was responsible... in some way...
Now what do I do about the photographs?
Take 'em!
Oh!
There isn't a single face that doesn't look like a child's - not a single one - if you catch it at the right moment.
It would be a challenge!... Unlike anything I've photographed!
What have you photographed, Mark?
Everything. But nothing I'd want children to see.
But this would belong to them - and they'd know if it wasn't right... Oh, Helen... I would like to find those faces for you... with you...
Very well! Let's try!
You made a promise to your mother -
 Yes, Mark...
You'd better keep it.
Thank you...
Mother must have gone to bed. (she turns to find him looking at her) Mark, it was a wonderful evening...
That's what I was going to say... a wonderful evening...
 And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
 I'll get it for you.
wonder how this sees grown-ups? (she turns the camera round) ...me, for instance... now that I am one. 
Not you! (he takes the camera from her)
Mark.
It never will... see you!
Why not?
Whatever I photograph -
Yes?
I always - lose...
I don't understand.
He'll wake Mother!
... thank you, again, for my evening. (she is standing very close to him, smiling up into his face) Will you go to bed now - and not stop up watching those films?
Well... I've a little work to do... then I'll go to bed... and think of how to find faces for you...
...faces which - are faces which...
Good night, Mark...
Good evening, Mark...
...how did you?
The young man bathing himself brought me to your door... I managed the rest of the adventure alone...
This is one room I expected to find locked.
I was never allowed a key..., can't get used to them.
I brought her home early.
Thank you...
Is there something you...
... a talk.
Next door would be more...
I'm at home here... I visit this room every night.
Visit?
The blind always live in the rooms they live under...
Every night you pace for hours above my head! Why?
I've no one to talk to... in the rooms I live over...
I'm told that you stare too much... so do I.
Cloth... with something hard inside it...
It's a changing bag... we put films in it - so that the light won't spoil them...
How odd - that the light can spoil anything...
Every night you switch on that film machine.
What are these films you can't wait to look at?
Like a chair?
What is the film you're showing now?
Why don't you lie to me? I'd never know...
You'd know at once -
Take me to your cinema.
Yes.
What am I seeing, Mark?
Why don't you answer?
 It's no good - I was afraid it wouldn't be.
What?
The lights failed too soon.
 They always do.
I'll have to try again.
I've yet to meet an artist who could judge his own work...
What do you think you've spoiled?
An opportunity... now I must find another.
Why are you putting those lights on my face?
Mark...
It's almost over...
Please let me finish! It's for Helen!
What do you mean? It's for Helen?
She wants to see something I've photographed!
My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs...
Please... don't be frightened.
Not frightened! Hot!
So put that camera away...
Yes!
In rather a hurry, aren't you?
It's late.
You must be tired...
You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.
I won't be selfish... You can take some more pictures - if you want to...
No... thank you.
 Why not, Mark?
Run out of film.
Can't you find some - to please Helen?
You don't trust yourself to take any more, do you?
Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't it Mark? A pity it can't be photographed.
if I'd listened to it years ago, I might have kept my sight. (she approaches the door) I wouldn't have let a man operate I had no faith in... so I'm listening to it now... (she puts her face close to him) It says all this filming isn't healthy - and that you need help...
... get it, Mark... get it quickly... and until you've got it... I don't want you and Helen to see each...
I'll never photograph her... I promise you that.
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark. And if you don't listen to me... one of us will move from this house - which would be a pity, because we'd never find a cheaper...
You'll never have to move... because of me... I promise you.
Good boy.  The stairs are the difficult part...
Far enough, Mark...
taking my picture?
Yes ...
It's been a long time... since anyone did...
Mark... what's troubling you?
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
...you'll have to!
Have you any suspicions, Chief Inspector?
It could be any of them...
That's the trouble with film people - they're all peculiar...  ... present company excepted.
Speaking of peculiar people.
We've a psychiatrist coming down today. Dr Rosen -
I know him.
It's pure publicity - and I promise he won't do any work.
What will he do?
Get himself photographed... We're telling the press he's here to help the case - and to see if he can spot the murderer.
And the best of luck!
Do you object. Chief Inspector?
No...
I'll be frank. I'd welcome anyone's help... I don't know how this maniac kills - or why he kills - or who he'll kill next, but if he isn't caught quickly... 
Inspector, have you convinced yourself he's a member of my unit?
No, sir ... but a few things seem to point to it... No one outside your unit admits to knowing the girl... There was a trunk all ready for her... and with the risks he was running, I think he'd have to use surroundings he was familiar with... Where is your unit now?
Waiting for me on the set.
I'd like to watch them at their jobs, sir. It may tell me more than a hundred interviews.
But, Inspector, the strain on them is already...
Come now, Arthur, if that's what the Inspector wants.
I'm afraid it is, sir... now where could I get the best view?
 On the dolly... the camera... You can watch everyone and everything from there... including me!
Very well, sir ... I'll become a member of your camera crew...
 ... if the unions don't object!
I hear they're making an arrest today.
hope it's D.J. It's about time they caught up with him!
We're there, Doctor.
 Dr Rosen!  What a pity.
Try it, darling... We'll all be with you.
 Quiet, everyone. Let's run it!
Terribly sorry.
That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist!... Heard it on the grapevine.
 All right, everyone - let's run it...
I'd like to see... that one...
... have you it... in red...?
Certainly, madam.
... in... red (suddenly she covers her face in her hands') I can't! I can't, Arthur!
Ten minutes break, everyone!
Can you suggest anything, Doctor?
No. It looked jolly interesting to me.
I mean to help her psychologically...
Yes. Give the girl a proper rest... Ten minutes is useless!
 Thank you, Doctor.
What's your job?
I'm a focus-puller...
Oh... so am I, in a way.
I was wondering if you knew my father - Professor Lewis...
Professor... but of course I knew him. He lectured to me.
He was an extraordinary man - quite brilliant!
You know what he was interested in before he died?
No? Tell me...
I don't remember what he called it... It was something to do with what causes people to be... peeping Toms...
Scoptophilia!... That would interest him! A most fertile mind.
Scopto...?
philia... The morbid urge to gaze... Coined since his day... Have you any manuscripts of his which I could...?
He thought... it could be cured...
Usually. Now about his manuscripts -
Quickly?
The cure? Very quick... A couple of years analysis - three times a week - an hour a time - and it's soon up-rooted...
... if you've any of his papers on the subject?
Yes, Doctor...
I'd like to see them - I'll give you my address, young man.
Wonder what all that's about?
We'll find out afterwards... Now, listen... I want you to watch who brings their own lunches... Someone ate homemade cakes and sandwiches by the side of those bushes - and we may get a lead.
Right, sir.
We're stopping at four today - so have a quick lunch, everyone! Back at two sharp!
Hey, Mark!
Can't wait to show you this! (bringing out a small postcard) I ought to charge you!
You don't get that in Sight and Sound - Isn't she terrific?  Got some more - if you're interested?
You've given me... an idea...
I'll bet I have!
Hey! Where are you going?
Phone - may be my last chance - and... thanks.
But your lunch?
You have it!
... some photograph! Well lit too!
Can't manage Saturday, sir, but they're letting us off early today! This afternoon - after work - may be my last chance!
... be here at six o'clock. Milly'll be waiting.
Six o'clock...
On the dot, Mark, or she'll go.
I'll be there, sir.
You'd better be!
Hallo? Is that the Public Library? ... You have a Miss Helen Stephens employed there?  Yes... can you tell me if her name is spelt with a V or a PH, I want to send her a tic-PH? ... Thank you.
They're waiting!
He asked if I knew his father... which I did... a brilliant man!
Is that all he wanted?
think so... we had a little chat about scoptophilia - and he's going to show me...
About what?
Voyeurism.
Eh?
What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, apparently.
 Peeping Toms...
An interesting boy... he has his father's eyes... you don't suspect him, do you?
I suspect 'em all - what about you?
I'm interested in that chap with the bald head and hatchet face... there's something on his mind!
No wonder... he's the director!
All right, everyone. This is the last shot... Make it a good one!
 Got your list, Sergeant?
 YES, SIR.
I want to see how some of them spend their spare time...
Which ones, sir?
Exactly, Sergeant... (he looks round thoughtfully) ... which ones?
Don't make a habit of this!
I won't, sir.
Milly's upstairs.
Right, sir.
I've got to go out... If you finish before I'm back, lock up and put this through the letter-box... 
What's the matter? Haven't you ever seen a key before?
The till will be empty - if that's what you're smiling about.
You know what I want now! No fancy stuff...
You've spoiled my whole evening, you have!
Sorry, Milly.
What's the idea?
I shan't be here tomorrow. (he hurries to the window)
Why? Going on manoeuvres with the boy scouts?
I thought so!
Have you gone absolutely...
I'm just... completing a documentary.
You're a document and a half, you are. Is it safe to be alone with you?
... might be more fun if it wasn't...
Darling...
Darling.
Hallo.
Hallo, Tony...
Where are you going?
To leave something for Mark...
You haven't much time for me these days.
Tony...
It's all right - I'll be here - if you want me. (he turns to his room) ... by the way... your mother was yelling out something before you came in... about Mark photographing her.
Photographing Mother? You must be mistaken!
Of course. See you sometime.
Mark...?
Mark?  No answer. She looks thoughtfully at the envelope in her hand - then goes in to the dark-room.
... don't know what to make of it, sir ... He went to a library, a solicitor's office, and a newsagent's shop - private photography there, if you ask me. Shall I hang around outside the house, sir? Don't think so, either... All right, sir, I'll give you the details when I get back... Bye, sir. (he replaces the receiver)
Chief Inspector Gregg! What?  Put him on the line...
went up to look around - found her.
Yes, yes... What's the address? ... Newsagent's shop? ... Did you say news...?
Don't let me see you... frightened... (he pushes the door wide open...) Leave! (he looks at her - then looks quickly away) Hurry, Helen!
Not...
Leave!
Not... (she turns away from him and forces the words out) ... till I know...
Now!
That film...
That film...
... is ... just a film...
... isn't it?
... horrible ... horrible... but... just a film... isn't it?
No... (he walks towards the door) I killed them... (he locks the door with a hint of sadness) And now that you know... I want you with me... a while.
You'll be safe - as long as I can't see you frightened - so stand in the shadows, Helen... please...
... please...
She's right... your mother... must tell someone everything... sorry... has to be you!
This was his laboratory... and you know some of what he did... but not all.
... aged five...
... aged seven...
All the rooms were wired for sound... and... still are.
Your room.
Your mother's .
Tony's.
No one will come in... honestly, darling...
I don't care!
But darling...
Stop it, Tony!
 Turn it off!
Look at me, Mark!
Not if you're frightened...
Look at me!
What did you do... to those girls?
No.
What did you do, Mark...?
If you want to torment me... for the rest of my life... then make me imagine!
What did you do ... to those girls?
Can't...
Show me, Mark...
But if you're frightened...
Show me - or I'll remain frightened... for the rest of my life.  Show me!
Do you know... what the most frightening thing in the world is?...
It's fear.
So I did something... very simple...
Very simple.
When they felt the spike... touching their throats... and knew I was going to kill them...
... I made them - watch their own deaths!
Made them see their own terror as the spike went in... and if death has a face, they saw that too!
Not you! Not you! I'll never photograph you! I promised - I promised - Not you!
... frightened ... for you...
Look out!
Mark! Mark! Give yourself up!
I've been ready for this... for such a long time...
What are you...
It'll be all right.
I can beat that!
Give yourself up... Mark!
Watch them, Helen... Watch them say goodbye - one by one - (he presses a master switch on the wait) I've timed this... so often...
No - No!
I wish... I could have found your faces for you...
Helen - I'm afraid!
I'm glad I'm afraid!
Don't be a silly boy... there's nothing to be afraid of...
Good night, Daddy...
