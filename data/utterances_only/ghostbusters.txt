 The chickens' heads jerk up toward the sound.
EMPTY_LINE
Sump'n's stirrin' up the chickens, Maude.
Jes' set easy, Zeke.  I'll take a look-see.
EMPTY_LINE
 Here, chick-chick-chick-chick.
What's got you girls so durned upset? There a coyote sneakin' 'round?
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
 Everythin' okay out there, Maude?
EMPTY_LINE
What say?
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
 Get away!' Scat!  Shoo!
EMPTY_LINE
 Help!... He-elp!
Egon, could you hold off on the weather balloon bit for a minute?
It's Your night to take out the trash.
And Winston's in the kitchen doing your dishes.
 Be with you in ...  ...one minute, fifty-three seconds.
EMPTY_LINE
 Thanks, Slimer.  I really needed that!
Sorreee!
 Egon!  The phone!
 In a minute, Ray.
 Nevermind, Egon, wouldn't want you to strain yourself.  Ghostbusters Central.
Calm down... Where are you?...  We'll be right there.
Ready for this one?  Some farmer says his wife was eaten by a giant chicken.
Hey, even a half-baked false alarm sounds better than doing Egon's chores.  Let's roll!
I think I've finally perfected it.  Watch this, guys. (a BEAT, he looks around over shoulder) Guys?
It sure feels strange not having Egon with us.
 Why?  Lately even when he's with us, he's not with us.
But wouldn't it be somethin' if he sells that weather balloon idea of his?  He'll be a rich man!
Good.  Then he can hire a maid to do his share of the chores.

Had big blood-red eyes, it did.  Biggest dang chicken I ever seen.  Mebbe six feet tall.
Shouldn't be hard to find.
Did it have any distinguishing marks?
Ray!  It's six feet tall!
 Thank you, Sir.  We'll put out a missing chicken report right away.
 This one's easy, guys.  Old Zeke's been watchin' too many horror movies and eating too much greasy popcorn.
No, Peter, I think we're dealing with a bonafide werechicken here.
A werechicken?
Get serious, Ray.
Then explain those!
EMPTY_LINE
Ow!
EMPTY_LINE
 What'd I tell you, Peter?  A werechicken egg!  Gimme a hand, Winston!
Look, if this is a werechicken egg,
...how come there's no PKE reading?
 I dunno... that is strange.
Let's get it back to Headquarters and run some tests.  Then maybe we'll have some answers.
Oh no, I'm not leavin'.  The werechicken that laid this has gotta be around here someplace -- and I'm gonna find it.
 I'll take it.  C'mon, Slimer.
 Werechickens.
EMPTY_LINE
 Yo, balloon man, we've got some real work for you:  How about analyzing this?
Interesting.  That's the second biggest egg I've ever seen.
I don't wanna hear about it, Egon.  We've had a long night in a not-too-fragrant barnyard, so I'm taking a shower and hitting the sheets.
 Ray, it's gettin' pretty late.  Maybe there really isn't any...
 Shh!
 It's in there.
 Then let's get it!
 Man, this place is creepy.
 It's in here -- I can feel it.
Look out!
EMPTY_LINE
 Something's close.  Very close.
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
It is a werechicken!
Man, he is ugly!
EMPTY_LINE
Bad choice of words, Winston.
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
Trap out!
Hang on!  That's it!
We've almost got him!
EMPTY_LINE
 Well, that takes care of one werechicken.
Now to find the six-footer that ate Zeke's wife.
Ray, I just had a thought...
What if that six-foot werechicken is Zeke's wife?
 Thanks for the help, Slimer, but I don't have time to examine this egg tonight.  I have to prepare for my weather balloon demonstration tomorrow morning.
 But it'll be safe in here.
Yeah.
 G'night, Egon.
Goodnight, Slimer.
EMPTY_LINE
Fooooood.
 Yummy!

 Slimer!  How 'bout some privacy??
 Monster!  Inna kitchen!
Monster?
 Uh-huh!  Uh-huh!  
 Ow!
EMPTY_LINE
 What?
EMPTY_LINE
 Egon?  Well, Slimer, I don't see anything here that looks like a monster.
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
Holy cow!!
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
 What'd you do to Egon, you bird-brain!
Peter!  Wait!
 Hey!
EMPTY_LINE
 What's wrong with you guys?  That thing ate Egon!
Peter, that is Egon!  The egg hatched, he was bitten and now he's a werechicken!
 You're kidding!  Come to think of it, there was a certain resemblance.
 What happened?  He's so quiet all of a sudden.
It's the moon!
Tonight's the first --
-- lunar eclipse in ten years!
Ray, what's this have to do with Egon being a chicken?
 Werechickens only appear during a full moon, and for the next few minutes, the moon's not full.
 Egon?
Ray, what is going on?
And why am I naked?
 Egon! 
Sit down, Egon, we have some good news and some bad news.
 Bad news first.
You've been turned into a werechicken!
A werechicken?
 Were-aardvarks ... were-bears werechickens!  "The werechicken appears during the full moon.  Anyone it bites will turn into another werechicken."  That egg Peter brought in, it hatched and...
 I remember the bite clearly.  How long will I stay like this?
 According to this, there is an antidote. But we've gotta move fast -- the eclipse only lasts three minutes!
 "One tablespoon paprika, one clove of garlic, some parsley for color, cup of gelatin..."
 I don't feel well.
 Take it easy, Egon.  You're gonna be fine.  Hurry it up, guys!
 "And one tablespoon of chickenbane."
 No chickenbane!
Then we've gotta go with this!  C'mon!
 Come on, Ray!!
 He's changing again!
 Quick, Egon, drink this!
EMPTY_LINE
We're too late!
What happened?
The potion only partly worked, because of the missing chickenbane.
Well, we hafta do something!
Don't get your feathers ruffled, Peter. There's a logical solution to every problem.
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
What was that?
The werechicken that bit Egon.  It's still out there somewhere.
 Let's stop that thing before it makes drumsticks out of anyone else!  Un, no offense, Egon.
 All quiet on the chicken front.  How about down there?
Not a peep.
 No pun intended.
EMPTY_LINE
That's it!
 It's in there!  A big chicken!  It's gotta be ten feet tall!
Ten feet tall?
 Maybe fifteen, I dunno.  Big!  I'm outta here!
 Let's split up.
How could we lose a fifteen foot-tall chicken?
EMPTY_LINE
We didn't!  Come on!
A giant chicken just came through here -- it was thirty feet tall!
Thirty feet tall?
Yeah!  Look what it did to those cars!
 It's how big?  Okay, Ray, I admit you were right about these Werechickens,...
...but I definitely don't buy them growing to the size of buildings.
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
 Ray, you were right!  The chicken's here, and he's a walking high-rise!
 On our way, Peter.
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
Egon!  What happened?
It's a long story, Janine.   Can you get my coat, please?  I'm due at the weather board in forty-five...  ...minutes.
But what ...?  Nevermind.
Are you sure you wanna go to a meeting like -- this?
Trust me.  I'm of sound mind at least.
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
 It's heading down 34th toward the Empire State Building.
Check!  We're almost there.
EMPTY_LINE
Take over, Slimer!
Roger!
EMPTY_LINE
Let's reel him in!
EMPTY_LINE
 Trap's full!  Somebody forgot to empty it!
 Whose job was it?
It's gonna blow!
 Peter, get outa here!
EMPTY_LINE
So how're we gonna, put that big bird on ice, guys'
 Peter, that's not a bed idea!  Chicken freezes at very low temperatures!
Yeah, but how do you freeze a 50-foot chicken in August?
Distinguished members of the Weather Board, my weather balloon has the clu-cluck-clu- capability --
... of entering the upper atmosphere where clu-cluck-clu cloud formations occur.
EMPTY_LINE
There, it can electronically alter weather cut-cut-cut-con-ditions to produce sun, rain, or...  ...snow.
EMPTY_LINE
 I, er, can explain this, but --
EMPTY_LINE
What?
EMPTY_LINE
 Egon, can we freeze that big chicken with your weather balloons
 Yes, but you'll have to work the controls.
 Piece of cake.
EMPTY_LINE
What's it doing?
It looks like it's about to lay an --
 I don't want to hear it.
Okay, Peter, the balloon's in position. Turn the lever to the extreme left.
EMPTY_LINE
 Anyone for dessert?
 You bet, Maude.
Lemme guess -- more chickenbane soup!
I'm actually starting to like it.
No more werechicken problems for us, eh, Egon? 
EMPTY_LINE
Uh-oh.
It came from the lab!
EMPTY_LINE
EMPTY_LINE
 It's just Slimer groovin' to his new James Brown tape.
 I feel good! I knew that I would So good, so good, so good! (big James Brown HOWL as we --) 
 Tell me, how do I get out of this chicken outfit?
