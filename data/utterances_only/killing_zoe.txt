Hotel Mondial.
Le Mondial.  Tres bien.
Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un moment.  L'autoroute est ferme.  A cause du 14 Juillet.
[Do you mind the radio?]
[Do you want me to turn the radio off?]
 I don't speak French.
 Ah.  American?
That's right.
That's good because I speak a little English.
I asked if you mind the radio.  Music. You know.
 Super cool.
What time is it?
Time, time, time.  I don't know. Daytime.
Are you in town for business?
Yes.
It's a nice hotel.  Your hotel.  Very big rooms.
Do you know Paris?
I've been here once before.  When I was younger.
Those were the days.
Married?
I beg your pardon?
Do you have a wife?
No. (then after thinking about it for a while) Why?
Well, if you need a wife for the night... (searching for the right words in French) Une escorte.  Pour vous faire visiter. (then back to his broken English) For business.  I give you my number. Very nice girl.  French.  Like when you were young.
Know what I mean?
Speaks the language of love.  Take you to heaven and back.  You just tell me and I set it up.
What you laughing at?  You let Moises set it up.  She treat you right.  She treat you fine.
 Your package...It arrived in the last night of before last night.
Ah...telephone, for the room service.
The toilet.
To hang the clothes.
From here you can operate the television.
 Merci.
Oh, wait.
What time is it?
 What time is it?
 Time.
Ah.  Yes.  Il est presque huit heures moins dix.
Bonjour.
 Bonjour.
Wow.  Vous avez une belle chambre.  Je ne suis jamais venue dans cet hotel.
Ca sera 150 francs de l'heure.  Toute la nuit pour 700.  D'avance.  Et faudra porter un--
I...don't speak French.
It's okay.
It will be one thousand francs for all night.  In advance.
We can do it now if you want.
Well, let me just dry up.
Okay, but it's not necessary.
 What's your name?
Zoe or Zoey.  Which ever you like.
My name's Zed.
 That's funny.  We both have Z names.
What was that?
You can take those off.  The pants.
I'd rather watch you get undressed first.
 Alright.
Slower.
Alright Mister America.  Zed.
Slow enough for you?
C'etait formidable.
I'm cold.
Zed?
Yes?
Moises told me you were in town for business.
Yes.
What kind of business?
Why?
I don't know.  I'm just curious.
Do you ask all your clients questions?
No.  Just the ones I like.
So you like me?
Yes.
Why?
Because you're...a good person.  I run into some real creeps.  You know.
How do you know I'm a good person?
Body language.  We fit together.
All men and women fit together.  Hell, even some men fit together.
No, but you know, we clicked.  You made me orgasm.  Do you know how often I orgasm with a man Moises sets me up with?
No I don't.
Usually never.  They're almost always fat like pigs.
And you make me feel safe.  That's something more important than the orgasm. An integral part maybe of the orgasm.
I never really thought of it like that.
Well, it's true.
Turn off the television.
So I mean it when I tell you Zed, I like you very much.
Well, I like you too Zoe.
Honest?
Why?  For the same reason?  Any man can orgasm.  Even with his own hand.
Well, I like your honesty.  You're open. Unlike most prostitutes I've been with.
I am not a prostitute!
Really?  Can I have my francs back then?
I'm a student.  And to pay for the classes I became an escort.  It's my choice to sleep with you.
I see.
What?  You don't understand.
No, I do.
Hey, it's not easy.
I didn't say it was.
I'm here because I want to.
Okay, okay relax.  What school do you go to?
The Centre du Art, Paris.
That's really interesting.  What kind of art do you study?
Not any of the old shit.
Oh.
I have a day job too.  Three times a week.
But someday there will be only my art.
What kind of things do you paint?
I don't paint.  I make things.  Objects. Not like sculpture.  Like life...but with no narrative.  I want when someone looks at one of my objects for there to be no reference to the world.  Void of feeling, emotion...void of destiny.  Those are left for me.  They belong only to me.  If someone else can see into it...then it is no longer mine.  I have failed.  And I would destroy it.  I don't care how much cash they would offer me.  It would be shit.  I can't tell you how many objects of mine have been destroyed.  They told too much about me.  And if someone wants to know something about me...I'll tell them myself.  The way I'm telling you.
What I do I do only for the objects.
I'd like to see one of these.
What?  So you could see the work of a whore?
Zoey.  I'm sorry for calling you a prostitute.  I didn't understand the difference.
The difference is a prostitute would have lied to you about her orgasm.
If these things you make are as true as you are...I'm sure they're as indescribable.  Perhaps, someday, you'll make one...about me.
If I do...you'll never know which one it is.  Because I'll be the only one who understands.  I'll be the only one who can look into it and see where in my life it came from.
 What time is it?
I have no idea.  Night time.
I'm going to take a shower.
 Hey you madman!
Eric.  Come in.
What happened to you?  I thought you were going to call.
 Oh I see.  You have been busy.
Sorry, I asked the hotel to give me a wake up call.
That's good, but now I am here.  So let's go.  We have a lot to talk about.
What about the girl?
Is she your girlfriend?
No.
Fuck her.
She's a dishrag whore.  Kick her out.
I'll let her stay here tonight.
Don't be silly.  It's dangerous.
 [Okay.  Get out of the shower.  It's time for you to leave.]
[Fuck you.]
[No.  Come on you fucking slut!]
[Let go of me you shit!!]
Eric.
 Don't worry about her.  [Why don't you just go back to your pimp and suck his black dick!]
God damn it!
[Get the fuck out of here you fucking whore!]
[Give me my clothes you asshole!]
 God damn it.  Look at my hand.
 Jesus Eric.
Ouvres!  Je veux mes habits!
Oh shit.  Her clothes.
 Tu te prends pour qui espece de connard!?
La ferme!
So tell me, what have you been up to?
Allez vous faire enculer tous le deux!
Eric, I liked that girl.
Oh.  Well, then why didn't you stop me.
Because you were on a rampage.
Look, your whole life you've done nothing but fuck whores.  A girl like that will give you AIDS.  Why don't you find a nice girl in the suburbs?
Because when you need to get off you don't want to have to date for months to do it.
Just use your hand like me.
Sometimes you just need honesty...and security.
I don't understand.  Anyway, it's too late.  Get dressed, let's go out and meet the boys.
Okay, let me take a shower.
No, in Paris it's good to smell like you've been fucking.  It will make them respect you.
Oh.
Just put on a shirt and a sport coat.
I'm glad you came.  How long has it been?
Years.
It's amazing, you know?  Here you are. One day in America.  Now here.
Well, to be honest there really wasn't much happening for me in the states.
But in Paris your old friend Eric has a job for you, so you came.  That's good.
How could I resist your invitation?
You would have been stupid to.
So what have you been doing here?
After school I spent some time in Algeria studying African philosophy.  And then I bummed around.  You know.  For fun.  For a while I worked at Le Figaro.  The newspaper.
Really?
Yes.  With an assumed Masters degree. And lately we have just been bombing fascists here in Paris.  You know, like terrorists.
It's fun.
The people next door are on holiday.  We took their phone.  If you want to make a long distance call, go ahead.
Is that cat dead?
I don't know.  I think it's asleep but it's been there for days.
I guess it is dead.
Hello.
 Okay.  This is Francois, Ricardo, Jean, Oliver, and Claude.  Got it?
I will.
They all know who you are.  Ne soyez pa salauds.  Offrez une biere au plus grand perceur de coffres.
 Zed, would you like a beer?
Thanks.
Don't think of it.
 Come.  Sit down.
 Easy.  Don't scare him.  He just wants to claim you.
Let me introduce you properly.  This is Enrique.
He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we don't always get what we like...do we?
 Tais-toi!  Do you like hash?
 Don't sit next to that junkie.
Ahhhhhh!
 That little shit monkey of yours pissed on my Billy Holiday albums.  Next time he's out the door.  Zed, come here.
Here you go mate.
Thanks.
Don't ask me where we got this.
Okay.
On Bastille Day, all the banks are closed.
But this one.  BIP.  The Banque Internationale de Paris.  And for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain closed next Bastille day.  Yes?
We will go in and shut the bank down. Now, look at this.
As you can see, only one person can start the alarm.  The concierge, at this desk. (he points it out on the blueprint) We will take care of him.  Then we can close the bank.  No one will know the difference since every other bank will be closed.
 Are you sure he won't push the alarm?
Ahhh!  He's right next to the door.  We'd have to be totally incompetent not to stop him.  Don't worry about that.
Here.  This is where they keep the days reserve cash.  Okay fuck that.
There are many vaults downstairs, but this is the vault we must get into.  This is where the real prize is.
What kind of vault is that?
Ah...Swiss made.  A Caliber.
Caliber?  It'll take three hours.
No, that's too long.
That's how long it'll take.
Well shit.  It's too long.  We have to be in and out.  Like that.  Or there will be suspicion. A little time is okay...but too long and...
Well hold on a second.  What's this?
Another vault.
No this.
I don't know...it connects the two vaults.
Well, what kind of vault is this other one?
 Also Swiss, but this one is a Poseidon.
Why would those two vaults be connected?
I don't know.
Because I can get into this vault in half an hour.  Maybe less.
But this entry way is too small to get the platen out.  We have a lot of merchandise in there.
No, don't you see?  We get in through this secondary vault and take this passage to the other main vault.  From the inside I could open the Caliber vault in five minutes.
You could open it in five minutes?
From the inside it's easy.
 Hot damn.  That is our answer.
Okay.  When is Bastille day?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow!?  We're doing this tomorrow?
But of course.
It's impossible.
It's not impossible.  Everyone knows what to do.
I don't know what to do.
You don't need to know shit.  Just get into the vault and we'll do the rest.
I haven't even seen the bank.
Fuck the bank.  Before we do a job we live life.  It's better that way.  Okay?
 Okay.
Good.  Now we do heroin!
 You have to look at the Starship Enterprise as a metaphor for the human brain.
 Spock is the right hemisphere of the brain, all logic and intellect. Mc Coy is the left hemisphere, stricktly emotional. And Kirk is the unseen observer.  He drifts between the two.  Back and forth, as it might be, caught between the two thought processes.
[Cotton.]
 It's really quite brilliant you know. That's why Star Trek is and always will be a hit show.
 [Here, shut up and hold this.]
[Don't want to get air bubbles in my veins.]
Do you want heroin?
No, I want to be sharp for tomorrow.
No.  A little bit of heroin, some hash, a beer...and you're just right.
Okay.
 That's good.
 [Hold my arm.]  My vein is like a rock.
 Try some.  It's called chasing the dragon.  The Chinese have been doing it for centuries.
I don't think so.
Oh, but you must.  It will make you feel as though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that you're rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper.
There.  That's Notre Dame.
Do you like French cars?
 Yes.
I like the Cadillac.  Fifty-two to seventy-five.  Very nice.
Up here you can see the Eiffel tower.
Is tomorrow really Bastille day?
Yes, tomorrow we pull the biggest job in French history.  And spend the rest of our lives in Monte Carlo.
[Faster, faster...go faster.  Let's beat them!]
[Shit!  That bastard.]
 Watch it!  Don't crash my car.
Over here is where the male prostitutes sell themselves.  Do you see?
 Fucking fags!
 Suce ma bite?!
Perverts d'homosexuels!
 This is good to have you here.  We could not do this without you.
Everyone has agreed to give you double shares.  That's good.
You know I have AIDS.  From the needle.
Really?
Okay, up here is the Arc de Triomphe.
So, how long have you known Eric?
Well, Eric's mother is American.
Yeah, and his dad's French.
They're divorced.  And she and his father had some kind of six month split plan set up.  So every six months he would come back to the states.  We were best friends.  Eventually he and his mother had a falling out and he stayed here. It's been...years.
Well, it's good to have you here.  Eric speaks fairly highly of you.  Say, he says you're a big fan of Viking films.
Well...I suppose.  I used to be, when I was young.
Oh they're the best.  Helmets with horns on them.  Shit.  That's fucking genius.
How 'bout Toy Jazz?  You like it?
Yeah...I guess.
I love it.  It's really good, you know? Like real music.  It has a heart and culture all it's own.  It's, like, jazz for dwarves...or guys in Leiderhosen. Total purity of essence.
Yeah.
Hungry cannibals'd like it.
Here, you must drink some of this wine, it's good.
 Non merci, c'est de la merde.
 La ferme.  C'est du bon vin.  The fucking English.
Look at him.  He's crazy.
I'm glad you came.  How long has it been?
Years.
It's amazing, you know?  Here you are. One day in America.  Now here.

 La ferme.  C'est du bon vin.  The fucking English.
Look at him.  He's crazy.
 [Drop the gun!]
[Drop your gun now and nobody dies!]
[Good boy.]
[I'm going to check things out downstairs.]
 [Now!  On the ground!  Face down!]
[All clear down here?]
[Take these two upstairs.  And chain the gate to the sub lobby shut.]
[The phones and video are down!  We're locked up tight!]  We fucking did it!
[Any others I should worry about?]
[No.]
 [Well, just to be sure--]
[Freeze motherfucker!]
[Who the fuck are you?]
[Please don't shoot me!]
[On the ground!]
 [Making a deposit I hope.]  [Bring him with us.]
 [Vault locked?]
[Shut your fucking mouths!]
 [The vault doors are shut and time locked.  You won't be able to open them.]
 [You think we're fucking amateurs?  You think we're stupid?  I've got news for you...we planned ahead my friend!]
[Now save us a lot of time and just open the vault.]
[No.]
[Okay.]
[Open the vault.]
[I cannot.]
[Oh.]  [Can you?]
[No.  Once closed only I can open it.]
[Then open it.]
[I cannot.]
[Do you understand that I'll kill her if you don't open this fucking vault?]
[Do you understand that this is an international reserve bank?  Robbing it is punishable by life imprisonment.]
Jesus fucking Christ!
[Open the vault door or I'll kill this man next.]
[I still cannot open the vault.]
[Come on.  It's only things in there. This man is flesh and blood.]
[I will not open the vault.]
Eric no!  I can open the vault!
Shut the fuck up!  [You're a customer in this bank and this is how they treat you.  Do you have a family?]
[Would you like to see them again?]
 [This man has a family he would like to have Bastille day dinner with tonight. So save us some time and open the vault.]
[No.]
Fucking idiot.  [You seem like a nice man.  Tonight at dinner think about how lucky you are and how much you love your family.]
Oui.
 [Take him upstairs.]
Don't you ever conflict with me during work again!  Do you hear!?
You didn't have to shoot any of them!
 Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you were in charge now.  Nobody told me.  If he had opened the vault it would have saved us a fucking hour.
Eric.  It's just that we've gone from being thieves to murderers.
Oh fuck it doesn't matter!  Here you get the death penalty just for robbing a federal bank.
I thought the death penalty was abolished in 1980?
Ohhhh!  That's what they tell you!  But who cares?  I need to take a piss.
 Why don't you open the vault?
[Looks clear.]
[What do you mean you're not sure if the alarm went off or not?]
[I mean I'm not sure.]
[Well, either it did or it didn't.]
[And I'm not sure.]
[Well, do you think it did?]
[I just fucking told you, I don't know.]
[Take a guess.]
[It didn't.]
[You're sure?]
[No.  It's just a guess.]
[Well what kind of a fucking guess is that?  You're saying it could have.]
[Yes.]
[Well that's fucking great.  Why didn't you just kill that asshole to begin with. I knew I should have been the one to kill him.  You're always so damn slow.]
[Shit these masks are really hot.]
[I know, I've got fucking sweat stinging my eyes.]
 [Do you know one?]
[Let's see.  Okay.  An unfortunate fellow was locked up in prison doing five to ten for armed robbery.  All he could think of the whole time was eating pussy.]
[The day finally came for his release. He walked out of the prison with a new suit and fifty francs the officials had given him, and made a bee-line for the whorehouse in the nearest town.  Slamming his fifty francs on the front desk, he said, "I wanna eat some pussy."]
[I'm not done.  Listen.  "Where've you been," said the greasy fellow behind the desk, "fifty francs won't get you a close look these days."]
["Listen buddy," said the ex-convict, pulling him out of his chair by the shirt collar, "I wanna eat some pussy, and I want it now!"]
["Okay, okay," gasped the proprietor, "I'll see what I can do."  So the ex-con followed him through to the very back of the warehouse through some stained, tattered red curtains, and into a grimy little room where a bedraggled looking whore lay spreadeagled on a filthy bed. "She's yours for fifty francs," said the proprietor, and the fellow went at it.]
[After a little while, he came across a piece of egg.  "That's funny," he thought to himself, "I don't think I had egg for breakfast."  But he spat it out and kept eating away.  Next he found a piece of chipped beef wedged between his front teeth.  "I'm sure I haven't eaten chipped beef this week," he thought, but kept on. Then he came across the corn.  "What is this?" he said, "I think I'm going to be sick."]
["Ya know," says the whore, "that's what the last guy said."]
[No one fucking moves!]
[Shit!  What happened!?]
What is it?  What's going on?
I don't know.
No!  You stay here.
[Nobody fucking moves!  Nobody fucking moves!]
[The gun!  Somebody get it!]
[Don't fuck with me!  Don't fuck with me!]
[What the fuck is going on!?]
 [This crazy fuck shot Ricardo!]
 [Eric, your mask.]
Oh shit.
Who gives a damn if they see us or not anyway!  I can't see a fucking think in this!
[Is this what happens?  Is this what happens when I walk away for five minutes?]
[He had a hidden gun.]
 [He had a hidden gun.]  [I don't care!]
 This is insane!  I am a U.S. citizen! You must let me go!
I'm an American!  American!  I'm just here exchanging dollars.  If it wasn't for my country you'd all be speaking German!
 [I have had enough of this nonsense!  The next person that speaks will die!]
[Eric, I'm sorry.  Things got out of hand.  But we're in control now.]
[Good.  Let's try to keep it that way. God what a mess.]
Eric
[What the fuck is it now!?  You want me to hold your hand as you take a piss?]
[I have a question.]
[What?]
[Do we know if the alarm went off or not?]
[Yes.]
[We do?]
[Yes.  It didn't go off.  If it had the police would be here and our whole plan would be fucked.  But they're not here, and our plan isn't fucked.  So if there aren't any more fucking stupid questions I'll go downstairs and see if we're in yet.  Is that okay with you?]
[I thought the phones were dead.]
The phones are dead.
[Answer it!]
[Answer it or you will die.]
 Banque Internationale de Paris.
[It's for you.]
 [Hello.]  [Who is this?]
Oh my God!  The police!
 [What do you want?]
 [We're all fine in here.]
 [No.  I'll tell you what, you go fuck yourself you fucking pig.  You send anyone near this building and I'll kill the first person I lay my hands on.  I've got plenty hostages here to kill so don't even think of coming in.]  [Just stay put.  We'll call you when we're ready.  In the mean time, have a nice day.]
[The silent alarm must have gone off after all!]
[Shut the fuck up!  The alarm didn't do shit.  For all we know your idiot shooting brought them here.  Anyhow it doesn't matter.  Nothing has changed.]
[My God!  The police!  What are we going to do?]
[Nothing.  We don't have to do anything. The plan stays the same, just slightly different.]
[If the police decide to come in...kill them.  And if you don't mind, stack those bodies somewhere else.  This place is a fucking mess and it's bad for morale.]
 What's going on?
Nothing.  They were just scaring them.
Well, did you tell them to stay quiet?
Yes.  They're assholes.  Just having fun.
Fucked up my drill bit.
It's okay.  You can buy another one.
Cross your fingers.
Perfect.
Excellent.  What next?
We find the fuse box.  It'll probably be upstairs.
It's okay.  I'll find it for you.
No.  I need to see it myself.
I think it would be better if I looked for you.  I could--
Hold on.  Here she is.
Let's see.
Okay, you throw this fuse switch off and then back on when I call to you.  Any other switch may set off the alarm.
Oh, I wouldn't want to do that.
 Got it?
 Got it.
Come on sweetie don't fail me now.
 Ready?!
 Ready!
Now!
Open seasame.
It worked!
Oh my God it worked!
I can get through that lock in a minute.
Then do it.  We don't have all day.
Dime store brand.  Three minutes max.
Good.
Fuck!
Merde!
Jesus Christ!
Another security guard?
Must be.
I think I stained my pants.
Me too.
What is it?!  I came down to see how things were going and heard shots!
Some asshole in the vault.
We've got guns.  Why don't we just storm in and blast his fucking ass!  It's three against one!  Let's give it the old--
Quiet!
I'm just trying to be helpful.
Just let me think.
You don't have to snap at me.
 [Hey you.  Nice shooting.  Play time's over.  Why don't you throw out your gun?]
[Come on.  We don't want to kill you.]
 What is this guys problem?  [Come on!  You're making me impatient.  I don't have all day.]
[Then take a paid vacation.  We won't tell if you won't.]
 What the Hell are you doing?  Have you gone mad?
[Well, look, we're going to give you fifteen minutes to change your mind. Okay?]
 That's too much.  It's dangerous.
I like danger.  [Changed your mind yet?]
[Should we see if they're okay?]
[No.  They're just blasting the vault open.]
[What does it matter now?  We're fucking surrounded by police.]
You asshole!  You could have killed us all.
But I didn't!  Let's go check out the damage.
Zed look!
I beat you!  I opened it in under three minutes.
 Go around and wait at the main vault door.  When I tell you, open it up.
Right.  When you tell me, I'll open it up.
Right.
Right.
I'll be at the other vault waiting for you to call to me.
Look at it!  We're all rich!
We're rich!
We're rich!
We're not out of here yet.
Yes but we're rich!
I'm going to show the others.
[What?  You think we may actually get out of this?  You're fooling yourself.]
[Why are you such a pessimist?]
[Are you kidding me?  Look at this mess.]
[This is nothing.  Imagine the police outside.  We're dead men.]
[Jean, Francois, Claude...look at this.]
[You did it!  You got in!]
[Zed is opening the vault now.  This is a taste.]
[Look at this and tell me I'm not brilliant.]
 [You're a monster!  And you'll never leave this place alive!]
 [None of you are worth half of this single bar.  Remember that.]
[Eric...can I speak with you?]
[Of course.]
[In private.]
[There's no need.  I have nothing to hide.  What is it Claude?]
[Well...we're surrounded by the police and we have no way out.  What are we going to do?]
[What are you doing Claude?  Talking of all this false doubt.  What do you think we're going to do?]
[I don't know...not the original plan.]
[Obviously, since Ricardo fucked us up and didn't kill the concierge fast enough.  And killing all these assholes-- (motioning to all the customers) [--isn't going to do us a damn bit of good now, is it?]
No.
[No.  Because we'll need them as hostages when we get on the plane.]
[We're going on a plane?]
[Claude, you are a mental giant.  Leave the plans up to me and just kill people if they get out of line, okay?]
[Okay.]
[I'm going to see how things are going.]
[They want to fuck with me!?  They want to fuck with me!?]
[You want to fuck with me!?  I'll show you what happens to people who fuck with me!]
[The moment of truth my love.  You knew it would come.]
 No!
[No!  What ever it is you're going to do have mercy!]
[Have mercy?]
[Yes.]
[With her.]
[Yes.]
[That's sweet.]  [You have quite a reach my lovely.  Is he one of your clients?]
[It's a deal.]
[Thank you.]
[Don't mention it.]
[Eric!  What are you doing?]
[Clearing up the "how full of shit am I" question the cops are asking themselves right now.]
 [Hello.]  [Yes.  I'll hold.]  [I'm holding.]
 [Hello.]  [You don't know the fucking half of it. So just shut the fuck up and listen.  Try any more stunts and I'll fucking really go crazy.]  [Well that's good because if you faggot cops even think of it I'll kill some more people.  Hear?]  [No.  None of that.  We won't trade. That never works.  Not in the movies, not in real life.  Understand?  We're going to get into our van, with a couple of people, go to the airport, and fly out of this shit hole city.  And you're not going to follow us.]  [Who do you fucking think is going to supply the plane?  Us?  No, you fucking imbecile, the French taxpayers would be a good second guess for you.  You're really pissing me off.  You think I'm a fucking amature?]
 [I fucking hate cops.]
Are you still there?
 Oliver, now!  Open the vault!
Open seasame.
Do you want to give me a hand?
Sure.
Holy mother.
Here, help me with this.
Merde!
[That's what you get!]
Eric.
[The fucking police won't budge.  I kill a man and they don't care.  They say they don't make deals with terrorists.  It really fucks up my plan.]
[And what if we gave up?]
 [Claude, look around you.  We're not talking prison here.  You know.  The cops will give in.  You start killing women...they give in.  They're all so fucking much in love with women!]
[What are you looking at you fucking whore?]
[Are you afraid I'll tell these people that this is only a day job for you?]
[What?  So they know that you're a--]
[Shut up!]
[My only mistake was not to make an example of a woman to begin with.]
This is unbelievable.  Look at all of this.  It's wonderful to touch.
Just help me steer this out.
Do you think we should get some cash also?
What for?
Well, you never know.
Money is too easily traceable.  You'd never be able to spend it.  And forget about exchanging it.
That's true.
No sir.  Your best bet is to get these bars melted down in Tunisia or Korea.
Eric knows someone in Portugal.
Or Portugal.
 [You fucking bitch!]
[Bitch!]
Do we have a covering of some kind?
A what?
You know.  Something to cover this with. It'll look kind of conspicuous leaving the bank with a platten of gold.
Oh, it won't matter.  The police know what we're up too.
Police?!  What do you mean they know what we're up too?
You don't know?  We've been discovered. But Eric has them under control.
No I didn't know!  How many police?
The building is surrounded.
Kill her!  Kill her!
What the fuck are you doing!?
[They're trying to smoke us out Eric!]
[What do we do!?]
Do you really love your bitch whore girlfriend that much?  She's really fucked with your mind.
Eric...what are you talking about?
Look at it.  It's all for us.  The smoke. The attention.  They have no idea of who they're dealing with.  They have no idea what kind of men we are.
 What kind of men are we?
You can no longer be in our club.  You forfeit your cut of the pie.
What about our friendship?
Shit Zed.  I haven't seen you in years. You hardly know me.
Never let a girl come between two men.
Now let's try to get out of here.
[The police!  They're entering the building!]
 [Smoother and more giving than the most selfless human being.  You're beautiful.]
[Eric!]
[Jesus, what now?]
[The police are coming in!  We're doomed!]
[Get a hostage.]
 [They don't give a fuck about the hostages!]
[Don't make me!]
 Zoe...
 My Zed.  They've hurt you.
 You're going to be okay.  In many countries scars on the face are a symbol of heroism.  To proudly display a flaw like a badge...is to wear a badge of truth.
Be serious Zoe...I can stick my tongue through my cheek.
Oliver!  Let's get a hostage!
This is the end!
Listen to me.  We're going to lock ourselves into one of the air tight vaults...if any of them are still open.
Bastard!
Merde!  The vault has been closed.
What about the others?
Listen...there's no gunfire.
 Motherfuckers!
You wanna fuck with me?  You wanna fuck with me?  I'll show you who you're fucking with!
C'mon, we'll be safer in here.
[Think!]
Zed.
 What's your girlfriends name?
Zoe.
Zoe.  [Zoe, come here to me.]
[Killing you would just be gravy, so don't fuck with me.]
[Go ahead you slob.  Shave my ass!]
Zed no.  I'll kill you.  It means nothing to me, our friendship.
 Eric...there's no fucking way out of here!
Oh but you're wrong.  This is my way out. This dime store couge with her motor driven ass.  You find your own.
Come Zed...I'm going to cut you like a sausage.
Zoey, get out of here!
Did you see how she ran?  Did you see how she ran?  She doesn't care about you. Fucking pussy only cares about pussy. Look out for number one.  What do you say Zed?
I will kill you.  And once I kill you Zed, I'll get out of here.  I'll fuck your bitch up the ass and give her AIDS...if she doesn't already have it. What do you say to that Zed?
Fucking bitch!
Ox!  Where is thy yoke!?
Fuck both of you.
Au revoir.
No!
I give you little kiss.  Ciao.
 [I work here.  This man is a customer...he needs medical help.]
The hospital?
No.
Come on.  I have a car.
I'm so tired.
We'll go to my flat.  You can rest there. Do you feel pain?
No...it was mostly his blood.
I have a shower.  You can clean up there.
Thank you Zoe.
My name is not Zoe.  Not any more.
You'll get well.  Then I'll show you the real Paris.
