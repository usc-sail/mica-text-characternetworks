You hear about your ex?
Jerry?
Yeah, asshole Jerry. He's moving to Middletown. He left this morning.
No way.   How do you know?
Carter said. He got some job at some company, giving his uncle hand-jobs.
Doesn't sound so bad.
I got us tickets to see Adam tomorrow.
I don't want to go to a baseball game. You're going with Derek anyway.
Ally, I don't want to go either, but Derek told Adam he'd go, and I'm not going by myself.
I thought Adam was hurt.
I wish.
 Hey! Jimmy!
Finally!
Office hours are nine to five.
You have a lot of credit card bills in there, Jimmy.
 I know.
You're not mad that we're stopping by like this?
It's no big deal, but let's hurry up.    I gotta go to work.
 Jimmy's got like, six jobs.
Hey Jimmy, hold up a sec. Look, not for nothin', but you know Buggerin' Bobby Bales is askin' about you?
Askin'?   Like how?
Like how you owe him money on the Dallas fiasco, those chokin' motherfuckers, and you haven't been returnin' his calls.
How you hear this?
Yesterday. I was puttin' a twenty-timer on Indiana for tonight, and he up and out- of-the-blue asks about you. Jimmy, man. Goddam.
 It ain't nothin'. He's just makin' conversation.
It ain't nothin'? That faggot juicehead's gonna make a playground outta your asshole like he's back in the joint, and it ain't nothin'? And you heard all the stories I heard, about that horse-cock, and how he can't stop shootin' his mouth off about it too, like when he whipped it out at Tomlinson's party...
Alright Brad! Christ Jesus, I owe a little, shit, but I'll pay. Believe me, that guy wants his juice, his e, he comes to me. It's fine.
Put some cash on Indy tonight, Jimmy.
Yeah. Alright, come inside and let's do this thing. I got work.
Nice.
Fuck you, conjo. This is my shower.
Maybe back in Mexico that's a shower, in Athens that's just dirty.
Clean the pool, conjo, clean the pool.
At least I'm paid to be here.
Wynwood Pool House, Corey speaking.
It's me.
Emily?
Some other girl would be calling you?
How'd you get this number?
Don't you work there?
What do you want?
I need you to come pick me up.
Are you kidding? Where are you?
At home.
What for?
Just because. I need to stay with you for a couple days.
Emily, our place is tiny, we got no water. Our phone just got shut off, too. You'd be miserable like us. What for anyway?
It's no big deal. Just come pick me up.
Fine, forget it then.
Corey, come on! How many times have I called you since you left? I wouldn't ask, except I don't have anywhere to go. Please.
Fine. Alright, fine. If you wanna stay in our little dump, fine.
Fine.   Thanks, then.
Aren't you supposed to be watching Katie right now?
Did you get my message?
 You have one new message.  Hi Jess, it's your mother, calling to say happy birthday, since you'll be gone when I get home. I'm driving your sister to school and I'm leaving the car for her, so I'll be taking the train back.
By the way, you should call your sister and stop this not-talking nonsense.
Anyway, I know how you hate long messages, so I'll see you tomorrow...
That's fucking bullshit.
Here we go again.
What about my car?!
Jessica, your sister got into beauty school, and she's going. Now I've got about two hours sleep before I have to drive her all the way the hell up there.
Yeah, I heard that.
Jess, you're still living here for free.
On the couch!
Jessica, it's still my car, and she needs it. Can't you be happy for your sister?
Oh yeah, I'm real happy. She gets my car, and I get shit. Thanks, Jina. Do me a favor and tell her how fucking happy I am for her.
If you're going to be like this, I'm just going to bed.
Hey Jimmy.   You fix the lat machine?
Yeah.
Jimmy, I'm just gonna say this, alright? I gotta let you go. I can't afford two employees.
So you're keeping Melinda?
Yeah.
Ron, that is totally fucked!   I been here way longer than her!
Yeah, but I'm running a business. There're guys who pay me dues just 'cause she works here.
But she doesn't do anything! She just sits at the front desk all day.
I know that.
Tell her to fix the fucking lat machine, she'll look at you cross-eyed.
I can't afford two employees, and she attracts business. That's it.
Fucking great. Thanks.
Jimmy, don't take it personal. If you were built like her I'd keep you.
Bales.
So where you been?
What are you talkin' about?   Nowhere.   I been working.
So you just don't return my phone calls.
Look, they lost, I owe you some more, so what? I'll pay you. I want to put it on Indy tonight.
I can't take any more of your bets.   I look like a spineless fucking fag.
What the hell am I supposed to do with you Jimmy? People are talkin'.
I know they're talkin'!
You don't know a fuckin' thing. Come by my apartment tonight, we'll figure this out.
I ain't like that.
Ain't like what?
Nothin'.
You don't know what I know.   You'll see.
I'm working tonight.
Jimmy, I ain't about beggin'. I'm lookin' like a fool all on account 'a you. You owe me. You owe me. I'm gettin' sick of it.
Is she alright?
She fainted.
Alright, I'm calling 911.    Everybody stay out of the pool.
Alright, well, quit horsing around. The Blandino's had a break-in. There's glass all over the patio.
That's Jerry's unit.
Jerry moved to Middletown.
He quit?
He left a message. You gotta take care of all his stuff now, too.
Aw, come on, Pete! I need off tomorrow! I told you I got community service!
So you're gonna have to get everything done today then. Get going.
Keith, I told you to clear the pool!
Doesn't Carlos want his car back?
He's letting me borrow it.
Well then why were you late if you had his car?
I slept late.
Were you drinking last night?
No.   But thanks for asking.
Were you doing drugs?
Katie, I told you, drugs are for losers.
And you're not a loser.
And neither are you.
But it's okay to drink.
When you're older it'll be okay.
How old are you?
Old enough.
But you're not twenty-one yet. The law says you have to be twenty-one.
Katie, can you not ask so many questions today? I've got too much to think about.
Cause it's your birthday?
Yes.
Happy Birthday!
Thank you.
Hold on tight or you'll get hurt.
I will.
 Turn left at the light.
She's in here.
 Can you give us some room, please?
 She's breathing.
 What happened?
I'm not sure. She just passed out, right where you see her.
Did you see her eat anything?
Uh-uh.
I know her.
Yeah?    How?
When I was dating Steve, that slut fucked him.
How do you know?
She started dating Steve right after we broke up. I mean right after. I asked him if there was another girl, and he never answered. He couldn't answer, because he was fucking that slut.
That doesn't mean they fucked.
Alright, she ain't comin' around.
 Whoa, easy.
 I know what I'm doing.
Uh, Heather, you want to step on it?
We'll get there.
You don't even know for sure if she slept with Steve!
Listen, fuck that slut, okay?! She can fucking rot in hell! I'm not rushing for her slut ass!
 Heather, c'mon, she's out cold!   We gotta hurry!
I-don't-fucking-care!! That slut can kiss my ass!  You hear me, you fucking bitch?!
 Hey-a, Jimmy, you don't hafta be here 'till 2:00! What's up, eh? You hungry?
Nah. I'm gonna start early, if that's alright. I could use the cash.
Still paying offa those credit cards, eh Jimmy? I told you them things are-a trouble.  Sweetheart! Don't a worry about that! Jimmy's a here and he's a gonna take care of it!
 Hey-a Jimmy!
Hello?
Where the hell are you?
Carlos?
Why weren't you answering your phone?! You were supposed to bring my car back last night!
Yeah.     Sorry.
You bringing it or what?        I need it for work!
Not 'til this afternoon.
What the hell, Jess?!        You said I'd have it last night!
Alright, relax, I'll bring it.
Dammit!     Where are you?
I'm getting on the Parkway.
What the hell?!
What's the matter?
Jess, you just passed me!        In my car!
Jess, this is bullshit! Bring back my car!
Jess, I know you're coming back here. I know you're not leaving me standing here.
Sorry.
I would have brought the car back, but I need it.
So you ask.
I said I'm sorry.
Yeah right. And why the hell are you still driving?
Fine.
Where's the squirt?
At my place watching TV.
You left her alone?
Just for a minute. I left my novel at Aaron's.
You need it now? Aren't you supposed to be watching her?
Yeah, I'm stuck with her all weekend. I'm just gonna get through these last few weeks like I promised, and I'm done, I did a good thing, and some other moron can take a turn being her big sister.
Don't know why you wanted another sister when you hate the one you got.
What're you up to?
Guess who stopped by.
Who?
Guess.
Mary Lynn.
Yes.     Gigantic beast of a woman that she is.
Aw Carlos, I think you should give her a shot. She's probably one of those personality girls.
Yeah, what you know about personality?
I bet she'll give it up right away.
Now that's something you know about.
You should go for it.   Drain them pipes.
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
 Hey, Car, it's me. I got a delivery in the area so I'm stopping by a little early. See you in a little while.
Whoa. (returning to the Sports Section) Slow down, there, buddy.
Yeah?
Are you seeing anybody else?
Hello?
 Hello?! Are you seeing anybody else?!
No.
You're not cheating on me?
No.
Be honest.
You're startin' to annoy me.
You're fucking annoying me!
 Fine.
Don't you hang up!
Then calm down. You told me to tell you when you're in one of your moods? Well guess what?
See?     That asshole's cheating.
Just because he won't move in with you doesn't mean he's cheating.
Ally, he's a cheater. That's what he does - he cheats. Now it's my turn just like all the others.
Let's go.
Where?
You coming in?
No, but tell asshole I said hello.
See ya.
Aaron here?
No, he went to yer place lookin' fer you.
Shit.     I left my novel here.
You got no idea why he's lookin' for you, do you?
What're you talkin' about?
You been fuckin' around.
No I haven't.
Well, someone did somethin', cause Aaron caught somethin' an' he ain't happy about it.
He caught somethin'?     What the hell did he catch?
Wouldn't say. Just said that he ain't been with anyone, so it musta been you.
Shit.
You humped someone, didn't you?
I didn't do shit.
Well it musta been the immaculate infection, 'cuz he got somethin'.     He's lookin' fer you.
Shit, shit...
Yeah, you did it.
Fuck you, Pitt.
Hey, mehn.
What're you doing back?
I got your sister. (forming breasts with his hands) She got big.
That's my little sister.
She's hot, mehn. Esta buenisima.
Just take her back to our place!
I can't because we got no place.   We got thrown out.
He threw us out?!
Si! And all our shit's still in there! And Pancho, too!
That's illegal, isn't it?!   He can't just lock us out!
Si, he sucks cock. I mean, I gotta go find a job, I smell like shit, I'm fucked!
Maybe you should talk to your boss.    Like, ask him to take you back.
No, fuck him, mehn! Just gimme Mr. Cocksucker's address.
What for?
I take care of this.
Don't do anything that'll get us into trouble.
Do you think I'm stupid, mehn? Don't worry about this. I talk to him. But first I take care of business.
Okay, mehn.     Good. Voy a cagar.
Saw your cat outside.
I gotta get back to work. I got more pies in the car.
Car?
 Yeah, it's Jimmy!
 Hey Jimmy, it's Matt. I need some K.
Matt?!   Speak up, man, I can barely hear you!
 I need some K, dude. I need it for tonight.
 What?!
 Jesus Christ, Jimmy! My folks are home! I need some K, dude!
Alright, alright! I got it, man,      got plenty! I'll see you tonight!
Yeah, it's Jimmy!
Jimmy! Jesus, man! Listen to me! I need one a' your special deliveries - I won't be around tonight!
Alright, man, when do you need it?!
Like, now, dude! For tonight!     I'm taking off!
Matt, you're way out of the way, man! Wait for another delivery.
Look, I need it now, man!     Now now now! I'm takin' off!
What's the rush?!
 Look, dude, I'm takin' out this girl - a friend of Setzer's. He said I could bang her easy if I had some K.
Really?!
Easy, dude, easy.    Setzer's words - it's in the bag.
Jesus!
Jimmy? (still dazed, but immediately friendly) Hey, what's up, man?
Shit, Dave, sorry 'bout that. I was talkin' on the phone. I didn't see the stop sign, I guess.
Don't sweat it.  I could give a shit about this thing. I was hopin' some rich doctor or lawyer or somethin' hit me.
Holy shit, man, is she alright?
She'll be alright. You didn't hit us that hard - it's gotta look worse than it is.
What're you, a fuckin' doctor?    We need ta get her to a hospital.
Fuck that, you'll have all kinds 'a problems if we do that. Cops, insurance and whatnot. You probably got drugs on you...
Dave, look at her fuckin' head!     She's bleedin' all over the place!
Just give her a minute, she'll snap out of it. She's a stripper, for god-sake.
That's retarded.
See?   I told ya.
Dave, you're a sick fuck.   I'm calling 911. Look at the blood!
Put that shit away. I'll take her home and give her some K, she'll be fine.
She needs a doctor.   What the hell's K gonna do?
Jimmy, listen, she's gonna be fine. A guy like you should be avoidin' that kinda' attention.
You should take better care of your girl.
Bro, she ain't my girl. She plows through all my drugs, and I fuck her like a goddam whore. She's a whore.
Fuck you, Dave, you asshole!
See, she's fine.
Holy shit. You're fucked up.  Hey, you need any juice or anythin'?
No, man, I'm good.
You sure? Look, man, I just got a buncha' stuff. Coke, e, K. I gotta sell it fast, you can sell it to your crackhead friends whenever.
You been placin' bets with Bobby the Bookie again?
No. I'm just, I'm payin', like, twenty percent on my cards and shit, and it drives me fuckin' nuts, pissin' all my money away.
Sellin' drugs ta pay off the plastic, huh?
You want it?
Look, I'm definitely interested in a little bit for myself, definitely, but I ain't no dealer like you. Lemme think about it.
Hey, your nose is bleedin'.
Seriously?
No, just horsin' around.
Listen, I gotta get going.    Patch her head up and shit.
Yeah.  Sorry, man.
Don't even sweat it, man, I told ya.
You smoke?!
Yeah, so?     You do drugs.
How would you know?
Everybody knows my brother does drugs.
So you heard about that thing that happened?
Yeah.   Everybody knows about that, too.
If you think so highly of me, what the hell are you doing here?
I'm just saying. Why'd you try to put everything back in the house?
We ran outta of gas. We were right outside his house - what the hell else were we supposed to do? He wasn't supposed to be home for another hour. At least he took it easy on us.
 Here, I brought this.
What for?
Dad gave it to you, remember?     You left it. I brought it for you.
Keep it.     I don't wear hats.
I don't want it.
You go to see him at all?
In prison?     No, not lately.
So what's the problem?     Vincent hitting you?
Vincent?    Vincent's gone.   She's on Victor now.
What happened to Vincent?
He found out about Victor.
 Vamos, I need the address!     I have a pen in the truck!
So is Victor hitting you or what?
No.
What then?
I don't wanna talk about it.     Forget it.
 Hurry up, mehn!
You know he has porno magazines all over his truck.
So?
Hey, Kevin, get off my bike, alright?
It's a moped.
Just lay off it.
Gracias.
Oye, don't get mad, but would you be mad if I try to fuck your sister?
If you think you can.
Maybe you think you can talk to her for me?
Pedro, she's fifteen!
No way, mehn. (forming breasts with his hands) No con esas tetas.
I'll have you sent to jail, man.     I'm serious.
No way she is fifteen.     She looks way older.
She'll look a lot younger on the witness stand, with my mom sitting in the courtroom.
Bueno, tell her I say good-bye.     I call you soon.
So what're you gonna do?
I'm gonna find Mr. Cocksucker and say, "Look, mehn, let us into our fucking home."
Wait a second... Why are you still driving this thing? I thought you got fired.
Si, si, but I need it. How am I gonna drive without my truck. They fired me, mehn.
I hate this job.
I should pick up one of them assholes.
Don't you have an appointment with Dr. Cook?
Five-thirty, and I'm not missing it.
Derek probably thinks you're sleeping with your doctor. There's nothing wrong with you.
 Ally, I have a pain right here that has nothing to do with my head. My dad died of heart disease, and if that asshole taught me anything, it's better to be paranoid than dead.
That's her.   Tess.
You're just guessing.
Ally, I know that's her.     That's his type, too. That little slut.
Harry's waiting.
Sorry if I snapped.
You didn't snap.
I mean this morning.
Oh.   That's okay.
I'm just afraid its gonna be the whole thing all over again with Derek, and then I've got to find some other asshole, and do it all again. I'm sick of the whole cycle.
So do something different.
I'm trying, but he's fucking it all up.
Yeah, where are you?
Right down the street, gettin' some more nachos.
Can you just come back and get me?     Hurry up.
Holy shit.
Aaron, I don't know how the hell you got...
 Fucking bitch!
 Use the back door, yo!
 Man, don't be helpin' that bitch!
I don't want to see you be hittin' no girl. Just calm your ass down.
Fuck you!
He's gonna kill her.
Where you goin', bitch?!
Drive!
 What's the deal?
What the fuck!
Fucking drive!
Fuck you!
Fuck you, you filthy fuckin' whore!
You like that, bitch?! Huh?!
Oh my God, my fucking eyes!
Jesus, look at my car, Jess!
That fucking... asshole!
Now I'm screwed too.
 I'm so sorry.
Pedro? What're you doing here?    Get the hell off my porch.
Hey, mehn, let me into my fucking apartment.
Either pay me or get off my porch.
Pedro!   What the hell are you doing?!
I'm hitching up your car to my tow truck.
Let it down right now you psychotic sonuvabitch!
Let me in my fucking apartment, mehn!
Pay the damn rent!
I'm gonna pay, mehn!   I got fired!
Bullshit! You never pay rent, and I know you've had a job! I'm sicka' this shit! Put down my car, or I'm callin' the cops to haul your ass outta here!
Listen, don't be a cocksucker.   It's not needed.
I'm done with it. Let my car down.
I need a job, mehn, then I pay you.
Margaret wants you out of the house anyway. Now let my car down.
You need some balls, mehn!     Why do you let her slap you around?!
Nobody slaps nobody around.
Hay, por favor! I come by here to pay rent, I always hear her slapping your ass around.
I'm going inside to get the phone. If you're still here when I come back out I'm gonna dial the police with you standing right here next to me.
Dude, what the hell?! I'm ready to go here! Where the hell were you?!
I got into a freakin' accident!
Bullshit, man, fucking bullshit! You make me come all the way out here! I been waitin'!
Look, you're pissin' me off now! Remember who's doin' fuckin' who the favor! I got shit I gotta do!
 Fine, fine! Just give it to me.
I didn't want to bring my bag to your house, with your fuckin' parents home.
Where's my Grand Theft Auto?
I lent it to Jerry.
What'd you do that for?    Get it back.
He moved down the shore.    This morning.
Alright, sixty bucks.
What?   Fer one freakin' jar?!
Dude, stop your bitchin' and pay up.      I told you this shit, I told you.
You said extra, I thought you meant, like, fifty!
Asshole, fifty is the regular fuckin' price!
This is fuckin' extortion! Knowin' I'm meetin' this chick, so you jack up the price!
Look! This is a pain in my ass, comin' way out here, and I said I'd charge you extra. I don't give a shit if its ten over the regular price, or twenty-five over your fuckin' "discount price," but you're payin' sixty bucks for this jar.
 Man, what the hell.  I need some cash for food and drinks, man! I'm takin' this girl out!
 Gimme fifty even.
C'mon, man! I need as much cash as I can get! What if she wants to go somewhere?! And gas! Dude, just take forty-five!
 Fine, you cheap-ass fuckin' bastard.
Here, man, go fuckin' get high.
 See ya.
He said "no," mehn. The cocksucker won't let us back in.
That's great.
Hey, this isn't my fault, mehn.
Hello?
Corey.
The Blandinos just called again.   The broken glass is still there.
 Hello?
And the grass needs to be cut.
 Okay, I'll take care of it.
 Don't forget to put gas in it.
Rob?     It's Corey Becker.
Hey.
You got any spare cash?
Corey!     Hey Corey!
Gorski says he can beat you!
Maybe he can.
Yeah right! Get over here and whip his ass real quick!
 Aw, c'mon! Corey!
Are you comin' with me to register tomorrow?
I dunno.
Why not?
My brother spent six thousand on tech courses and he's still painting houses.
 I'm gonna be late.
Why don't you just reschedule?
You know how booked he always is. I don't wanna be referred to that quack Hengis. I don't trust women doctors.
Dr. Hengis is fine. You're the quack.
Ally, I'm really feeling something. A deep ache, like someone's crushing me. This can't wait.
You still feel like going out?
Hell yes.
Yeah, its Jimmy.
Hey-a Jimmy! Where are you?! We got two calls from 45 Smith Street wondering where their food is!
 I got into an accident!
An accident?! Are you okay, Jimmy?!
I'm fine!    My car's banged up, but I'm on my way!
Okay!    Drive careful!
Yeah!
Hello?
Jimmy?
Who is this?
You don't have caller ID?
I'm driving.    Who is this?
Kwon.
Hey, Kwon.     What's up?   Where are you?
I'm on my cousin's phone.
Where's Car?
He's right here. He said you guys were supposed to meet.
He did? Well, yeah, I stopped by this morning. Nobody was there.
You didn't come in?
No.     Nobody answered the door.
Well, you want to come by now? I'll be here. You can make your pick-up.
Can't do it now. I'm delivering on the other side of town.
Deliveries? Jimmy, fuck the pizza.     Stop by and get your shit.
I can't.   What's the big deal?
Jimmy, my cousin's dead, and there's a shitload 'a shit missing from our house.
Car?
What do you think?
I don't know.
I want you to come over here and tell me everything that happened when you stopped by.
Nothing happened, Kwon.   I knocked and no one answered.
You didn't ring the doorbell?
That's what I meant.
And no one answered.
No.     No one answered.
You left a message on our house phone this morning. Why didn't you call our cells when you got here?
 Why didn't I call.     Good question.
What the fuck do I care, you think it's a good question?! Are you fucking kidding me?!
Look, I didn't think of it.    I got a lotta shit on my mind right now.
Jimmy, do you have my drugs?
No.
Alright.     If you hear anything, you call me.
I will.     Sorry about Car.
Thanks, Jimmy.
 Fuck off!
I'll take it.
 C'mon, let's go find her.
I'm not gonna go scouring the countryside lookin' fer her.
Gimme yer keys.
 Don't give him your keys.
 You want a smack? I am seriously gonna smack yer ass.
Don't give me no attitude, just cause you got mushrooms growin' on your balls.
 Let's go, man.  Fuck this asshole.
No, man, I don't wanna see you hittin' Jess neither.
Dominoes.  It's her.
Jess, come back here.
Yeah right.
Jess, I'm serious.      We need to talk about this.
Isn't that what we're doing?
Fine!   Who'd you fuck?
Nobody.
Bull-fuckin'-shit! I got bumps on my dick, and I never cheated!
Maybe its just a rash, 'cause I don't have anything.
Why don't we go to the doctor and get you checked out?
I can go to the doctor by myself.     And if I have it, I got it from you!
You're fuckin' fulla shit!
Whatever. If you come after me again, I'm gonna find someone to kick your ass. I mean it.
I believe it, you fuckin' whore! 'Cause it's probably the same dude you been bangin' behind my back!
I never cheated.
Tell Carlos I'm gonna kick his ass.
 What's up?
He's pissed.    Says he's gonna kick our asses.
Great.    I got a baseball bat in the trunk.
Good.
I gotta go to work in an hour.
Call in sick.
Yeah, maybe. You mean it when you said you were gonna find someone to kick his ass?
Yeah.
Who?
You don't know him. He graduated before us.
He a big dude?
 Not really, but he gets into fights all the time, at parties and stuff. And he knows a lot of people.
Call him.
I'd rather go over in person.
Why?
 I can be more... persuasive in person.
 Swell.
Hello, this is Katie Kinney!
Katie, it's Jessica.
Where are you?
Have you eaten?
I'm starving!
Okay, I'm going to be home in a little bit, okay?
Alright.
Drive.
Hey Mr. Carson. I got the rent.
Can you let us back into our apartment now?
This is only one month.   You boys owe three.
That's all we have. We'll give you the rest later, as soon as we can.
When you get me the rest, I'll let you back in.
Mr. Carson, c'mon! This is just temporary. Pedro lost his job.
Bullshit. You're always late. You should spend less time trying to rob houses, and more time working.
Aren't you supposed to take us to court before you throw us out?
Holy fuck, Shelby! Shut the goddam door already you stupid bastard! You're letting the cold air out!
 Tell it to my lawyer.
Aw, c'mon! Don't be like that! We're doin' our best! We're gonna be homeless!
Shut the goddam door!
Three months!
 C'mon!
Hey, can I park here?
 Si, si, of course. (motioning toward the Mustang) The transmission is broke.   Transmissions on these cars suck.
 Oh, and the tire's flat, too.
Ah, si, but that's no big deal.   That's fine, believe me.
Good luck.
Gracias!
Breathe out.
It's official. You're as healthy as you were last week, and last week you were as healthy as an ox.
Are you sure you're using that thing right? I feel this ache  Right here, like I'm being crushed between two boards.
Nobody's crushing you.     Honest. I'm sure. It's all in your head.     I know a couple quacks...
I don't need a head doctor!
I was just kidding there.
Heather, if you're going to insist on ignoring my rules, at least put your blouse on before you light up.
Can't I be concerned about my health?!   Is that so outrageous?!
Heather...
I just don't want to be walking around tomorrow and drop dead because my heart collapses, and so that makes me weird or paranoid...
Heather, there's nothing wrong with being concerned about your health. Please put your blouse back on.
So I'll see you next week then.
 Okay, yeah, see you next week.
I'm two pounds heavier I think.
Sorry.
It hurt. I knew it would hurt, but that was kinda worse than I thought. Does Heather... like it?
She never let's me do it.
She doesn't?    Why not?
I don't know. She does shave though.    How come you don't shave?
I don't know. I don't want to.     Do you love her?
I don't know.
How can you not know?
She's got problems.
I don't understand you. Why do you even cheat on her with me? She's so pretty. So much prettier than me.
She's   a nutcase. I'll tell you what, I don't   know why you do it. You should have a man   of your own - we say it all the time,   me and Heather.
Yeah, who? That slob you and Heather introduced me to last time?
He outranks me. He's a good guy.
Like me, I'm a good girl, and the best I can do is a guy that looks like that?
No.
You must think so. You tried to set me up with him.
I thought it was a bad match.     It was Heather's idea.
So she thinks I can't do better.
You know what she thinks better than me.
Let's get dressed, she'll be here.
Let's let her walk in on us, and look surprised.
Hurry up.
Hey-a Jimmy.    Where you been?
Around.     Deliverin'.
Hurry - sit down Anna eat something.       We got more deliveries for you.
 Poppy's!
Did your parents call?
Nope!    Where were you?
Out with Carlos.
The VCR is broken.
 'Los, are you hungry?!
I guess.
Are we going to have TV dinners all weekend?
No.     I promise. You want some milk?
Can I have ice-tea?
Of course.  Can you make her some ice-tea?
Aren't you gonna eat?
I'm gonna take a shower.
Are you Jessica's new boyfriend?
No.
I wish you were. I don't like Aaron.
Neither do I.
Don't you like Jessica?
Kind of, I guess. She's nice.
Take a look at that paper. There's at least a half dozen apartments I circled that would be perfect.
Yeah?  You're joking.  Alright, ten minutes.
 Great.
That was Tess. Said I had to come back in.
Are you fucking Tess?
What? No. Look, I gotta go. I'll see you at Carter's when I get off.
I'm not dropping this!
Since when do you drop anything?
You see that? He practically said yes.
What're you doing?
I'm gonna look through his shit.
You're finally flipping, I think.
You're a lot of help, Ally.        Really. Thanks.
See?!   See?!
So what.   Condoms.
Ally, I'm on the fucking pill. He hasn't used condoms with me for weeks.
So maybe those are left-overs.
Ally, these are not left-overs.        He never used regular condoms with me.
 Why not?
Because if he did, he took two fucking days to come. I always made him wear ultra-thin, ribbed, anything but this shit.
He took too long for you?
Ally, I'd be done, and I'd have to lie there like another hour 'till he got off. I couldn't fucking stand it. Why the hell do you think I started on the pill, Ally? Me. Putting that hormone shit in my body.
How would I know?
Well that's why.  Anyway, that's neither here nor fucking there. That asshole is using
Just call him and ask him.
No, no, fuck that. We're going to go to the party, have some fun. When he's all good and drunk, you're going to ask him when I'm not around.
Yeah right.
Ally, I'm serious. If he's drunk and having fun, and you just work it in on him real casual, he may slip. He'll never admit shit to me.
He won't to me either.
Ally!   Just fucking try it!
I don't wanna spy on him for you!
Ally, look, he's cheating on me, I know it in my heart, but I want him to admit it, alright? Before I fucking flush what's left of this shithole relationship down the toilet, I want him to admit it.
Fine, I'll see.
Fine.
Hey, Jimmy.
What's up.
I'm just looking for my stuff.   Let's take a ride.
Where?
Your place.
Can't do it 'til after work.
You're sitting here on your ass!
I gotta eat. I'm going back to work now. My boss needs me - I'm the only delivery guy.
Is that your piece-of-shit out front?
Yeah.
Let's check that out.
I told you, I ain't got your shit.
Hey! Until I find the drugs, everyone is a suspect!
 Fuck that. Let's look in your car.
Hey, it's Jimmy.
Hey man, it's Dave.   I got happy news for you.
You want the juice?
I told ya, I got plenty. But about the other stuff, I been thinkin' 'bout your problem, and I know a guy who could help you out. Buy a lot a' your shit all at once.
The juice?
No, no. I'm talkin' 'bout the coke an' shit. I might know somebody.
 Who?
This spear-chucker from Manville. Sold me some fake D-ball once. I tied his brother's dog to my front bumper and we talked it out. Turned out to be an okay guy. I gave him a call and he's definitely lookin'.
For how much?
Well, he's pretty small time, but he's itchin' to move up a few notches.
He's got money?
He talks so much shit it's hard to tell. You need to talk to him.
Gimme his number, man.
Kwon, what the hell are you doing?
When you off work?
Don't know.     Maybe nine or nine-thirty.
Hello?
Is this Sinjin?
Yeah, who's this?
This is Jimmy. Juicehead Dave's friend.
Yeah, I know.
 Hey!
Where the hell have you been!
I know, Pete. I'm real real sorry. I got things going on, you wouldn't believe it. My life is crazy right now.
You have a job here, Corey!     You can't just go taking off!
I know. I'm sorry. I mean, I know, the Blandino's. I'm going now.
I already took care of that! (hopping off the Lawn Mower) Just finish up what I'm doing, then take care of the fertilizer spill in the utility room.
Okay, alright, I will.
You got your job back?
Que?
 What the hell is that?!
 Ah, el Mustang?
Yeah!
That's our rent, mehn.    We stole it.
Hey, uh-uh, no way!    I didn't steal anything!
Don't worry.    We're going to sell it, mehn.
Seriously, are you out of your mind?      To who?!
This guy I know.
How do ya know he'll even buy it?
Don't worry. He likes Mustangs, mehn. Vamos, I got a place for us to stay.
Jesus, Pedro! I told you I wanna stay out of trouble! I mean, this is big trouble!
No jodas, don't worry about it. I stole it. But we need rent, mehn. I lost my job.
So you in or out?
Hey, Emily!    Get your stuff!
Asi me gusta, now you're being smart.
Where are we going?!
Just get in the truck!
You done already?
I got an emergency, Pete. I'll come in early tomorrow and finish.
Hey!
 Sorry!
What's up.
Hey Carter.
What's up.
 What's up.
Stay outta my room.
Wanna shot?
Later.   I wanna see how crazy it gets.
Skirt.
 I can't believe you're doing this.
 Ya think it's a good idea we leave it out here on the street like this?
 Forget about that, mehn. 
Hey, Pedro, what's up with the Mustang?
Que?    Ah, el Mustang?
Yeah.
Nada.    I'm doing a favor for a friend.
So you're driving around with his car hitched to your tow truck?
Bueno, he's a good friend.
Sounds good.    Come on an' grab a beer.
 Hey, listen, can I sleep on your couch?
Kimmock's got couch.
Come on, mehn, we're in trouble here.      We got thrown out of our home.
You got evicted?
Si. I went out to get a gallon of milk for my dog, I come back, my keys don't work, and the cocksucker put an eviction notice on the door. He didn't even tell us! Now my milk's spoiling in my truck, Pancho's probably pissing all over the place, I'm fucked.
Hey, listen, if you want, you can crash in Jerry's room. He moved out.
He did?
Don't park there. Park in back.
Si, si.     No problem, mehn.
 What's up, Becker.
Did you know he was having a party?
Let's go.
Wait here a second and let me talk to him.
What're you doing?
You need a hand?
I'm done.
Carter, I brought your sunglasses back.
Those were Jerry's anyway.
Oh. You didn't tell me that.     Is he pissed?
Who gives a shit? He moved out.
Carter, I gotta talk to you for a sec.
I gotta wash my hands.
I got a problem.
Yeah.
It's Aaron, that asshole.   He's pissed at me.
So what am I, a goddam marriage counselor?
No, but Aaron hit me, and he's gonna do it again.
He hit you?
Yes.
Like, he slapped you?
No, he punched me. With his fist, a bunch 'a times.
Why?    What'd you do?
I didn't do shit.
Look, I ain't gonna sit here all night. Tell me what happened. None 'a your bullshit.
Aaron thinks I cheated on him.
Why's he think that?
It doesn't matter.
Fine.
Alright, alright. He caught something - he got a rash or something. He says I gave it to him.
He's got a rash?! Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?! What the hell'd he catch?! Fuckin' herpes?!
Carter!
What the hell'd you give him?!
Nothing! He's fulla shit!    I did not cheat on him!
Fuckin' A!   You slept with me, like, three weeks ago!
That was the only time, that once, and there's no way he knows.
And you have something?!
No! Are you fucking listening to me?! And you wore a condom anyway! What the fuck do you care!
Whatever, Jess, what-the-fuck-ever.      And I'm sure I'm the only one.
Look, don't even get into the cheating thing, 'cause you're seein' Rachel still. Don't call me the slut.
Look, I'm not gettin' into it with you. I'm through with that bullshit.
Fine. Just, I need your help with Aaron. Just help me this one last time, that's it.
He's probably gonna be here tonight, Aaron.
You're kidding. You barely even know who he is!
No, but I know Troy real good. He said he'd be bringin' him. I ain't got nothin' against Aaron, so I said "what the hell."
Look, can you just kick his ass for me? Please?
Shit, Jess, I don't wanna be fightin' no friend 'a Troy's. Can't you just work this shit out?
Carter, he hit me! And sprayed me with pepper spray!
What the hell.
Look, if he tries anything tonight, I'll do something.
What'll you do?
Whadda you mean what'll I do?!  I'm gonna dance with him! Fuckin' I'll beat his ass! I don't wanna, but if he shows up tonight and makes like he's gonna hit you, I'll beat his ass.
What if he doesn't come?
Troy said he was bringin' him. If he doesn't, call him or somethin'. But I'm not a fuckin' bounty hunter whose gonna chase Aaron across the goddam country.
Alright?
Alright, fine.
You're welcome.
Hey, there he is! Jimmy!
Thirty bucks.
 I only got ten.
I don't believe this shit.
 Nine.
You got nine! Jesus Christ!      You knew what you asked for!
Jimmy, relax. My God.
No, this is fuckin' ridiculous. What'd you call me for? I ain't runnin' a goddam soup kitchen here.
 Can't you just take care of us for tonight?
Yes, for thirty bucks.
Here then, take nine for one.
It's ten.
You know what? You need to get laid, Jimmy. Maybe you'd relax a little.
Fine.     Enjoy your night.
Well I'm not going to drop to my knees for a lousy dimebag, so fuck him.
 What are you doing?
Watching TV.
Did your parents call?
Yeah.   I told them you were in the shower.
Okay... good. Thanks.     Are you okay?
Oh, hold on!    This is my favorite part!
Can you hear it?
Yeah, I can hear it.  Katie?
 I don't know about leaving the car out there in the open like that. You think we should, like, hide it somewhere?
Coo ya! Don't take this the wrong way, mehn, but you're like a girl. Bitch, bitch, bitch.
Somebody could see it out there!
Si, si.   Does your pussy hurt?
I'm serious, Pedro!
Who's gonna see it out there by the woods?
Everybody who reads tomorrow's paper.
Shut up Emily.
No, you shut up! Do you know how embarrassing you are?!
Look, it was bad luck as usual.    So what?
The car ran out of gas in the driveway!
The gage was busted!
Everybody at school makes fun of me!
And it was way down the block anyway.
 And then you try to put everything back! I mean, God, how stupid can you be?!
Just shut up, alright?! 'Cause you don't know shit about anything!
The Herald had a picture of the owner laughing at you!
Listen, I'm sick of your shit!
 Get off me! You fucking loser!
No wonder Victor tried to fuck you.
You're Jimmy?
You're Sinjin?
RJ. Sinjin said you'd be wearin' a bookbag. They're back here.
Hey.
Where you been?
Talking to Carter.
Is he gonna help?
He said he would.
Look.   Wanna shot?
You want me to talk to her?
No.
Si. So let's go fix the tire on the Mustang.
 You wanna play?
 What's dickhead doing? I knew he was lying.
 This is your best card?
I ain't happy about it.
Shut up and drink, asshole.  I should call him.
He said he'll be here.
He's probably got that Tess on all fours, fucking the shit out of her like the skank she is.  No, you're right, fuck him. (throwing three fours down on the table face- up) Drink. Fucking everyone drink.
Sinjin!
Mr. Pizzaman! What's up? (referring to Jimmy's BACKPACK) Got any calzones in there?
 It's harder than it looks.
 Sit down, man, sit down.
Yo, door don't lock.
Well you got to stand your big muthafuckin' ass outside then, 'cause ain't nobody comin' in here.
I don't give a shit.
Alright.     Jimmy, sit down, sit down.
I like to stand usually.
Alright. I'm Sinjin.      That legless waste is Louie.
I got legs little Massey muthafucka.
 I thought it was gonna be just me an' you.
It is. Don't be worryin' Louie - he's just here to have a good time.
What the hell are you doing?     We got shit to do mehn, important shit.
Hey, nineteen-ten, let's go.
C'mon.   Becker can't beat me.
You serve, Becker.
Not too good, baby.
Go find Mitch.
Take it easy. You got to go back and watch Katie.
Don't remind me. Please.
You signed up for it.
It seemed like a good idea then! Give some crappy advice every once in a while. I didn't think it'd be this constant torture, always wanting to do something, go somewhere. I'm so sick of it.
Some big sister.
Shut the door!
Hey!   Fuck... you! I would never!
Alright, alright! You little slut! I got one for you! (pointing to someone off camera) Right over there in front of the door!
 Well, he's got a nice body. He's a little scary looking ... he scares me.
You like it, too, you little slut!
Whatever!     You're the slut!
No!  No! Alright, okay, yeah!    Maybe! (grabbing a bottle of VODKA and a Cup) Bring him a drink!
 No, Ally, this one is for me. You take that handsome boy one of these other... (picking up and putting down various empty Liquor Bottles before finally grabbing a bottle of TEQUILA with a bit left) ... take him this!
Do we have any yogurt left?
I think so.
Bobby, where the hell are you? I gotta talk to you. Call me back right away.
 Hey girls, what're you drinking?
Vodka.
What're you mixing it with?
Vodka.
Really? A little girl like you. You think I might get you to share a little of that?
I don't know. There's not much left.
If you do something nice for me, I might do something nice for you.
I'm not that kind of girl.
No?  How about your friend here?
Oh, now you want to talk to me?
Mitch!   There you are!
Hey.
We're outside by the woods. We got the Mustang, mehn. It's beautiful.
Yeah, I'll be out in a minute.
I feel nauseous.
 This is Pedro. We worked together 'til last week.
 Vamos, these girls aren't interested in you.
 Pedro... what the fuck...
Come on, mehn. Come check out the Mustang.
Oh shit, I think I'm gonna be sick.
That's nasty.
Fuck you.
Wanna wash your mouth out?
My God, Ally.
One more.
 You guys suck - he'll be at the table all night.
You're Mitch?
Nice ta meet ya.
(tossing his RACKET to other side the table in front of Ping Pong Player Follow me.
You know I don't get involved with that shit. You sell your drugs and pay what you owe.
That's what I'm doing! Bob, just listen to me! I'm selling, but it's Sinjin.
Sayeed's little brother?
Yes. And Louie and RJ.     Fucking three guys.
One of 'em's a cripple.    Don't make such a big deal.
A cripple 'cause he got shot!     All I want you to do is just sit there!
Fuckin' sit there and what?     Pull my fuckin' cock...
 And nothin'! Goddamit fuckin' Bob, I'll handle everything. Everything. You just sit your big fuckin' ass there, it'll be enough. They won't fuck with you, bein' in prison and shit.
Jimmy, I ain't in a mood to help you right now. I really ain't. You're wreckin' my livelihood. Soon no one pays me. And I fuckin' help you? You're a thorn in my balls.
Look Bobby, alright, I told 'em I had a partner, that's you. You're gonna help me now or you're not. And if you don't, I'm a little fucked.
What the hell's the matter with you? What the fuck is going on in your head? You comin' to me, knowin' I'm pissed at you, and what for.
Jesus, Bobby, I'll owe you. Alright? I'll owe you. Just help me out here. Help me.
I still go there. I'm a freshman.
My brother.   Corey.   Becker.
Unfortunately.
 So what are you?
Yeah...
 Who is this?!
A friend 'a Carter's.
Oh, yeah, Carter! He's here!      Somewhere!
Tell him the cops are coming. There's been several noise complaints.
What?!
The cops are coming!     Tell Carter!
Oh yeah! Okay, I got it! Cops are comin'! Tell Carter! Who is this?!
A friend 'a Carter's!
Oh yeah, you already said that!
 Cops are comin'! I'm tellin' Carter.
It's a good car.
It's alright. I'd have to ask Jeremy. What do you want for it?
Make an offer.
Twelve hundred.
Twelve hundred! That's nothing!
Look, there's a lotta shit that Jeremy's gotta do with it. It's not like he can just switch the fuckin' plates and it's a go.
Coo, we got thrown outta our apartment! We need more money!
Steal some more cars.   I'll see what I can do.
You want another?
Aaron's here.
 Hey guy.
Hey.
You like talking to my girl?
Aaron, I didn't mean nothin'.
No?     Just friends?
Yeah.
What's the matter, don't like her that way?
 Go 'head, take her home. Fuck 'er brains out. She'll give you a little surprise.
Fuck you, I'm clean. You're the cheatin' asshole with bumps on your cock.
 Hold this.
Better wipe this off good. You never know.
You're good at that. You ready yet to go bang some dude? Maybe Carlos here?
Fuck you. I'm going to get Carter, and he's gonna kick your ass.
Carter ain't gonna kick shit.
We'll see, right?
Hold on a minute ...
That's for the pepper spray, asshole!
What's goin' on?
She smashed a whiskey bottle over his head.
He grabbed me! I'm not gonna sit and wait until he hits me again! He can just keep his fuckin' hands off me!
He grabbed her?
I guess so.   It wasn't a big deal.
 You're dead.
See?
Jess, you hit him with a bottle?
Before he fucking hit me!
 Look, I ain't got no problem with you.
Fine. You touch her, and I promised her I'd beat the livin' piss outta you. I'll do it. Lay off.
 You're lucky.
Carter, what the hell?!    You said you were gonna kick his ass!
I said I would step in if he hit you, and he's not gonna hit you.
This is fuckin' bullshit!
 Woe, dude.
 Jessica! What the fuck are you doing?!
If you're not man enough to do what you said, I will!
Jess, I'm not gettin' into this! I'm sicka' this bullshit with you! You bring this shit on yourself!  Don't touch her.
You know what? I don't need Carter. What're you gonna do, tough guy?
 Why don't you give me a minute and see?
Fuck you, you had your minute.
I'm all talk. I can't cheat on Derek. I love Derek. It's just that he makes me so mad. And that makes me a psycho. Every time a girl loses her temper, she's a
It's just every time you find a woman near Derek, you go absolutely nuts.
Let's not use the word nuts, alright?
You know what I mean.
Yeah, well, don't say nuts.
Alright, you are mighty, mighty... not very nice when another girl is near your boyfriend.
Don't say nuts, don't say psycho, don't-
 I don't say those things.
Yes you do!   Yes you do!
What I meant, I don't mean them. I meant that I don't mean them. That I don't mean to say them.
Well, what do you mean?
I don't know. I mean, you get so angry, it's a little scary.
I get scared when you get all angry. You get so mad sometimes, you start doing things, saying things to hurt people. Around you.
 Oh, I don't mean to! I'd never say anything to hurt you, Ally!
 I know. Deep down, I know.      But you get so angry...
I'm so sorry! Oh, you're right! I am a psycho! A rotten-bitch-psycho! I scare you - Ally - who would never hurt anyone or, or anything!
It's alright, I know you don't mean it!
I don't mean it! You're my best friend! My sister! I love you so much!
No, maybe you shouldn't.     Maybe I don't deserve it!
You deserve it! You're so perfect!
Don't say that! I'm not, I'm not!
Yes you are!
You fucking slut!
 Wanna take me in there and fuck my brains out?
Sure, I don't give a shit.
Fucking great, let's go.
What the fuck Jimmy?
Just hold on.
I can't figure you Jimmy.
 Where the fuck is RJ?
Take it easy you stupid motherfucker!
This your partner?
Where you been?
Just gettin' a drink, Jimmy.     You took long enough.
 Thought that shit didn't lock.
 You're Buggerin' Bobby Bales.
Excuse me you cripple motherfucker?
Buggerin' Bobby Bales.     Sayeed knows you.
Call me that again.
Louie, shut the fuck up.     Let's just do this.
Call you what again?     What everyone calls you?
Yeah.   Call me that.
Buggerin' Bobby Bales.
Bobby, let's relax now.   Louie may be a fool...
Where'd we park?
Over here.
What are you doing? Get in.
Open the trunk.
Jess, let's get out of here.
I want your bat.
Screw that.
I'm gonna finish what I started.   I'm gonna knock his teeth out.
Let's just go home.
Carlos, open the trunk!
Get in the car.
I'm staying, and so are you, so shut up.
What's the matter? Aren't you gonna put me in my place?
 Why don't you put that down.
Because I'm gonna use it to bash your head in.
You really want to do that?
You really wanna make me?
You're gonna do what you're gonna do, like always.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Let me show you something.     Can I show you?
What?
 I just wanna show you something.
No more 'a this shit, Aaron. Just stand back there. I'll bash you with this, I swear.
Look, just hold on. I wanna show you this. I got it a little while ago, for your birthday.
Can you see it?
What the hell is it?
It's J. H. C. I got it for your birthday.
 Bullshit.
Will you come closer and look?   Troy, tell her.
 It's your initials.    I told him it was stupid.
You like it, don't you?   I knew you would.
You're an idiot.
I know.
Does that hurt?
No.    Try whacking it with the bat.
Can we just forget about this?
Yes.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
How about two thousand even?
Can't do it.
Why not?
It's not economically...  Good, right, sound, whatever.
Okay, give us two thousand and I give you this nice stereo for free.
Where the hell you get that?
Yeah, what the hell is that?!
 It was in the car.
I don't want a stereo.
You can have it for free, mehn.
Where's the speakers?
In the back.
 This stereo's a motherfucker, mehn, I'm telling you. I was gonna keep it myself.
What's that?
I thought you'd tell me!
It looks like police cherries.
It can't be.
Look fellas, I'd like to help you out, but I'm not into buying stolen cop cars. It don't seem right somehow.
I didn't cheat.
Fine, you say so, fine.
That's it?
Well what the hell can I do? There's nothin'. I got your goddam initials tattoo'd next to my balls.
