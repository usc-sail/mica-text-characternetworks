 ...oil all over the street.  Cracked water and gas mains.  Four companies coming in...
 Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
Baltimore?
The game, Graham.  The Series?
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
 I seem nervous, huh?
It's 5:30, Gib.
 ...two Con Ed men trapped in an underground electrical conductor vault.
 A fun one.
Yep.
We got high voltage cables ripped loose in the underground.  They hit water, that fault's gonna arc.
Why haven't they killed the juice?
Switches are shorted out.
You're shitting me!
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
The block is being evacuated.  I don't want anybody... including our boys...within fifty yards of that tanker...it's a fucking bomb.
This is the Fire Department.  Frank Sullivan.  You guys okay?
That's exactly what we're gonna do.
 How do we get to the vault door?
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Forget it, Frank.  No way you reach those men in time.
 I can do it, Butch.  Me and my 'tank man' here.
 Start spraying down the street.  Let me know when we are fully evacuated.
 Frank, you hear me?  Frank?
 Yeah, Butch?
 The gas level is getting serious. The underground's combustible - it could flashover.  I want you to abort!  Now! Get the hell out of there!
 Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
 Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
 I should'a been a fucking mailman.
 Frank, where are you?
 We're in, Butch.
Time to go home, fellas.
Go, Gibby!  Everybody move it.
 Haul ass, that claw ain't gonna hold for long...  Take cover -- she's gonna flash!
You did good, Gib.  Real good.
Elvis has left the building.
 ...show me 'round the smokey mountains way down south...
Hey, bud.
Hey, bud.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Glad to hear that.
 How about a little of the King?
 Well, why not a little of the King?
Damn.
You alright?
I think I ruined the sauce...again.
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time.
 Caught in a trap, I can't walk out, because I love you too much b-b-baby.
How was your tour?
The usual.
 Butch called.
Did he?
He did.
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
Okay, start pedaling.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Daddy, I'm scared.
C'mon, Chief, show some guts.
I'm gonna let go!
Don't quit on me now, Chief.
Don't be so tough on him Frank, he's six years old.  He just needs to know you're right there behind him.
So, that's it, Sam?  You're just walking out?
I've been walking out for the last six months.  You didn't notice...or care.
Fine, go ahead and save the whole world, Sam.  You don't gotta worry about me.
Damn you.  I tried.  But you wouldn't help me.
You're right.  We should've quit a long time ago.
It's not your fault.  It's mine.  I can't change.  Wish I could, Sam.  But I can't.
That's not true and you know it.
Goodbye, Chief.
What?  It don't matter, Lady.  Why?... Cause I don't got no friends or family.
Batting next.  Johnny Sullivan.
Sullivan's safe at first.  Batting for Johnny's father is...Coach Newman.
Hi, Uncle John.
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
Sully!  Is that you?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
What the hell is that smell?
Can you believe Ellen still won't let me cook in the house?  I melt one lousy frying pan, y'know?
John, guess what?  Dad's taking me fishing.  Wanna come?
Wish I could, Gordy.  But you bring me back a big one.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
So Yahoo went up another two points. Man, did we miss the boat on that one.
Coulda, woulda, shoulda, pal.
Sam called Ellen.
Why don't you come with us?  Three days of fresh air and barbecue would do you some good, man.
Dad, John, c'mere...
Hey, Gordy, what 'ya doing?
Dad, check it out.  Fire Department!  Can I open it up?
Wow.
Hey!  Gimmie that!
What's this, Dad?
John, that's your Dad's old ham radio. Remember?  Remember how we used to beg him to let us talk on that thing?
This is not a toy.
Can we try it Dad, can we try it?
What the hell.
So this was what people used before the Net, huh?
Man, do I feel old.
It's junk, kid.  Nobody uses those things anymore.
Gordo, do you know what time it is?  Hi, John.
Ellen.
C'mon Gordy, let's go.
Oh, mom...
You all right, John?
Oh, yeah.
 Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
Is this anomaly connected to the space storm and the NASA satellite that disappeared in 1969?
We don't know.  But given the similarities of their location and appearance, this is a question that merits further investigation.
 CQ 15, here is WB2YXB, by for call.
CQ 15, come in 15.
Uh, hello?
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
 Name's John.
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
 Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
Where are you transmitting from?
Queens, New York.
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
I can't believe people are still using these things.
Can you hold on a second?
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
 I don't really follow baseball anymore.
What?
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
Fed up?  Lemme tell you something, in a 1000 years, when school kids study America, they're gonna learn about three things: the Constitution, Rock 'n' Roll, and Baseball.
How can you live in Queens and not love the Amazin's?
If you're talking The Amazin' Mets, well, that's different.  You know people talk about Seaver, but I'll love Ron Swoboda til the day I die.
 I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
No way, brother.  Ain't gonna happen.
Who the hell was that?
Hello, Queens.  You there?
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
 Sure.
 Take me out to the ballgame, take me out with the crowd.  Buy me some peanuts and cracker jack...
...I don't care if I never get back.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
 Luck, my ass.
 See that, kid.  Practice.  Practice.
 Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Nothing you're willing to do.
What's the story?
Survey crew found a body.  Actually a skeleton.  Over here.
Be real careful when pulling it out.  And get the dirt around it.
I think I'll visit the neighbor.
Thanks.
Used to get breakfast there all the time back from the boat.  Them Greeks were good people.  Once that McDonalds opened up on Dyckman, they lost all their business.
Your son on the job?
Was.  Carl died in the line of duty. October '69.
I'm sorry.
My boy lived and bled blue.
 I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
Sounds good.
 I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
 Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
 So how are things at the hospital?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
Close.
So how'd you like LION KING?
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
You work too hard, John.
Look who's talking.
29-years tomorrow.
I wish I could remember him better. Truth is, most of the stuff I know is from the stories you used to tell.  But they're not mine.  They're not my memories.  They're yours.
You would have liked him, John.  And he would have liked you.
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
 Hello?
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
Huh?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
This afternoon?
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
 I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
Sorry 'bout that.
What'd you just say?
Oh, that was my kid.
You call your son Little Chief?
Uh huh...
What'd you say your name was?
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
W...B...2...YXB.
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
What?
29-years ago.
29 years...?
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
What the hell...
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
I'm not dreaming.
So you're Frank Sullivan, huh?  It's 1969 and you're sitting at your desk in the study, just chewin' the rag?
Christ!
What's going on?
 Nothing...I just spilled something.
Oh my god.
What?
You just burned the desk.
What's happening?
You burnt the desk...I can see it.
That's impossible.
What if it's not...
Dad...?
Johnny...?
How could this be happening?
I don't know.
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Sun spot?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
You sound...ground up...?
I'm thirty-five years old.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
1998.
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
It's really you, isn't it?
Yeah...I think so.
Thirty-five?  Jesus, you're almost as old as I am...  What's your life like?  You married?  Got kids?
No, not yet.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
Nah, I gave it up.
You happy?
You're still my Little Chief, right?
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
 What's that?
I think I'm losing you.
No wait, don't go!
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
But you're not...you're not still here.
What are you talking about?
I lost you.
What?
I never knew you, Dad.
Why?
Fire.
On the job?
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
It did, Pop.  It did.
When?
October 12, 1969.
But that's tomorrow.
 Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
I don't understand.
 Sull!  What the hell!
I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Go in where?
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
Oh, man. Robinson is gonna nail it and we're gonna be dead.
Let's move it, gentlemen...three alarm. Lit up abandoned warehouse.  West 49th.
Sully, you cool?
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
I'm alright, Gibby.
How you feeling?
Better.
You get your roof fixed?
Can you believe it, Yahoo goes up another point today...
Bastard's moving fast.
Thank God it's abandoned.  Surround and drown...nobody goes in.
Hear that?
What?
Help!  Help!  Oh, god.  Help.  She's up there.  She's trapped!  Please!
Hey, hey.  It's gonna be okay.  We're gonna help.  Okay?   Okay.
Now tell me, who's up there?
My girlfriend, Molly.
Where?
In a room...an office...or something.  We live there.  Top floor.  Something fell on her.  I couldn't help her.  Please, you gotta...gotta...
You realize that if you'd bought a thousand dollars worth of Yahoo in '96, it'd be worth fifty-grand today?
You doin' okay, John?
Tough day, you know.
To my dad.
It looks open on the other side.
Don't know what's behind it.
One way to find out.
 Get out...while you still can...
 ...it's not your time.
 Gotta be another way up, Frank.
 Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
 Billy, you better get up top.
This is Billy, Frank. I'm on my way. South side.
 Glad to hear it.  See you on top.
 I've found the girl.
 It's real hot in here, Billy.  I'm coming out quick.
I'm jammed up here, Frank!
Oh mother...
What the fuck, GINO!  Tell me!
Gear box cracked, Butch.  We're fucked.
 Frank!  Frank!
I know, Butch.  I know.
...one wrong turn...  If you'd just gone left.
...principal calls us in 'cause Gordy hacked into the school system - sent out a little X-rated e-mail.  Scary, huh?  Eight-years old.
Just keep him away from girls.
 Just keep him away from girls.
You okay, man?
 Elvis has left the building.
 Little Chief.
John.  John, you all right?
 Longbranch...?
What?
You're not looking too good.
Whoa, I just...I just...
What is it?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Huh?
My father didn't die in a fire?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
Huh?
The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
 Johnny?  Johnny?  You there?  C'mon, Chief, answer me...
Chief?  Chief, are you there?
I'm right here, Daddy.
It's okay, Chief.  C'mere.
Okay, partner, whatta you say we tame this bronco.
I'm scared.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Take your time.  I'm not gonna let go 'til you say okay.
You ready?
Wait...
I'm right here behind you...
Okay!
 Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
 Atta boy.
Oh my God...
 ...can you hear me?
 Dad...?
Chief?!  Is that you?
Yeah, it's me.
You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
Dad, you there?  You okay?
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
Tell me.
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
I'm glad.
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
What, Johnny?  What is it?
What it was like when you died in the fire...
We needed you.  I needed you.  So many times...I wished for you.  But you weren't there for me.  Mom tried.  But she was hurting.  I used to hear her, every night, for years, crying herself to sleep.
I didn't think...
Well, you think about it.  And you remember, cause I don't wanna lose you again.  I don't ever want Mom...
 You won't.  I swear to God you won't.  I love you, son.
 Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
Ma, it's me.  Call me.  We gotta talk.
Frank...what's wrong?
Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
 I'm not goin' anywhere, Jules.  For the rest of your life.
Frankie, what is it?
I got a bad feeling today...I was worried.
I'm here.  Bruised but not broken.
Where's Johnny?
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
You give him his drops?
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
What's he doing?  Frank, I gotta...
Excuse me doctor, is that Benazepril?
Yes.
I gave this patient 50 mills of Benedryal on admittance.  Mix them and he's dead.
Why wasn't I made aware?
It's in his chart.
 I love you, Bud.
 I love you more.
Noah's Deli.  Can you hold?
Noah's Deli.
Can I help you?
 I'm looking for Julia Sullivan.
I think you have the wrong apartment.
But this is her place.  910 Riverside. Apartment 3C.
I'm sorry, but no one by that name lives here.
What?
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
Yeah.  That's it.
Do not disrespect me.  Disrespect yourself all you want.  But not me.  Or anybody else around here.  You got that?
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can count on.  I care about you.  Not cause of me and your old man.  Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
We got the preliminary forensics on that skeleton.  Your gonna want to look at it.
Bad memories...  You imagine the odds...us diggin' up a Nightingale Murder?
She makes ten.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times.
No.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
He ain't the only one.
I'm off.
 Wish you weren't.
 Do you know how much I love you?
Yeah, actually I do.
John, are you all right?
What are you doing here?
Ellen said you were working.  I just wanted to pick up the rest...
Dad, you there?  Can you here me?  Dad?  I need you to be there.
 Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
Are you alright"?
 Something happened, something...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
It's Mom.
What?  What is it?
She's not here.
Whatta you mean she's not here?
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
She just died, your mother just died?
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
When?
October 22, 1969.
Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How?
Johnny, I gotta know.
She was murdered.
Murdered?  Why?
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
What kinda twisted animal.
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
Whatta you mean...
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
What are you talking about?
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
I don't know...  What about the other women?
I'll warn them.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Then you get Mom the hell out.  But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die.  We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
What do I gotta do?
The next victim was Karen Reynolds...It happens tomorrow.  Case file says she left St. Vincents at six.  Show'd up at Cozy's Bar around six thirty.  She walked outta that bar around seven-thirty.  They found her dead in an empty lot behind the place at eight o'clock.
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
What do I tell them?
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
Hey, Chuck.
Hey, Karen.
Is that really how you got the Son of Sam?  Parking tickets?
Any word on our bones?
But how'd you think of it?
You're pulling over with a .44 bulldog tucked in your pants getting ready to blow somebody's brains out...I  figure the last thing you're thinking about is alternate side of the street parking.
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
From the girls, pal.  All of 'em.
I was, uh, I'm not really...
 A married fireman.
Frank.
Do I know you?
I don't think so.
 From the Korean market up the street.  Mr. Lee make you pay for those veggies.
I follow fires, nothing else.
 Sullivan.  You're kiddin'... 
Mario, you are the best...right, right, right.  Spell it out for me.
Yeah, it was a close call, but...
Close!  The news said it was a miracle you guys got out alive!
Close is just close if you're still alive to talk about it, y'know/
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
 April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Which means he probably knew her.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
 Dad...
 I think I'm gonna head up, take a shower.  You wanna tuck the monster in and join me?
What's the matter?
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.
Okay...
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I know.  He loves that thing.
No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future.
Sounds like fun.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
I'm serious.
So am I.
 Karen Reynolds is alive and well.  We did it, Dad.
 I'll be damned.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Whatta we do now?
 Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
Got it.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
How?
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
 Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
What are we like in...1998?
 We're okay...we're good, Dad.
 Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
You really wanna know?
Yeah, you betcha.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
Wow.
Hang on a sec, John.
 You there?
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
The future guy?
Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy...
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
H-hi.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?
Yeah, that's right.
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
She's pretty special.
Are you a good cop, John?
I try to be.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew, John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
I better go.  It's been good talking with you.
I wanna talk on the radio.
This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.
Gordo?
How'd you know my name, mister?
Hey, Gordo.  My name is Santa Clause. And I'm gonna give you the biggest Christmas present you ever had.
I better give you my address then.
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
John, you still there?
I'm right here, Dad.
You all right?
Yeah, I think so...
Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
Can I keep these for a little while?
Detectives' been through that stuff already back then.
You'll bring them back soon?
Promise.
Do you know this?
Mary volunteered over at St. Vincents' after school.  She loved it...was going to become a doctor.
Her room...I just couldn't...it should only be her room...you know?
I'm happy you found her, Detective.  It makes it easier...now, to know for sure. You know?
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
Three guys show up in both the yearbook and diary.
The third one is Daryl Adams.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
Uh, huh.
What?
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
Yeah.
You remember Mary Finelli?
 What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't.
Well, I think you do.
Give me a couple Bloodys, Gus, and a Dewars on the rocks.
How ya doin' there?
Just fine.  You?
Right now, just fine.  Ask me later, fireman.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
What I know is what I told you.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
So what?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Nothing.
You spare a smoke?
I'm trying to quite.  Turns out those things'll kill you.
Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!
Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
You fight fires, honey?
Yep.  That's what I do.
I bet you do.
Last call.
I gotta take a leak.  You need to use the head?  You can, y'know.  If you want to.
See you, Fireman.  Don't talk so much next time.
You know, Daryl, sometimes, despite all the training we cops go through. Despite all that we are taught about right and wrong.  Despite all that we would like to honor in ourselves, we can come to a place where we don't give a fuck.  Know what I mean?
You are going to tell me what I need to know, Daryl.
John.
Got a minute?
Yeah.  Sure.
He ain't our guy, John.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
If he was gonna give something up he would'a done it already.
You following me?
I asked you a question, asshole.
 Mary Finelli...
Who the fuck are you?
Yeah.  He just needs a little time kissing the porcelain.
OPEN UP, OPEN THE DOOR...ah...ummm...THIS IS THE POLICE.
It's okay, Ma'am.  I'm the police.
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
It's not your fault, Dad.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
No.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
Johnny, I know, but...
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
John, he's got my driver's license.
What?
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
He took your wallet?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
In my pocket.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
What?
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
 Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
What...
Please, Dad, just do it.
Okay, okay...
I got it.
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
Huh?
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
 I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
Hang on.
 Okay.
We're in business.  Just sit tight...and don't worry.
What the hell?
The old neighbor's son...the cop.  But he's dead.
What are you talkin' about?  I know this prick.  He worked outta Brooklyn North.
 He never died...
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
 Wife around?
 No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Oh.  Sorry.  How so?
Well, she, Eve was murdered, Detective. An ugly one to tell you the truth.
The mother of a cop, and they never found the bastard who did it.
Happens that way sometimes.  Son still on the job?
Nah.  Doin' P.I. work now.  Got caught up in them Knapp Hearings.  Set up by some dirty cops who needed a fall guy.  Hurt him bad.  Would've broken his mother's heart.
You used to be on the job?
Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
I look familiar?
 No.  What house you work?
The 2-3.  Homicide.
A hot shot, huh?
Nah, just working the job.
I hear that.
As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
No kiddin'?
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
Huh.
 Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
The past is a funny thing.  We've all got skeletons in the closet.  You just never know when they're gonna pop up and bite you in the ass, Carl.
Who are you?
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
Tell them where Finelli's body is buried. They'll be able to connect him to her. Same high school.  Same class.  I'm betting they search his place they find some souvenirs.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
Hello, Frank.
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
 Dad, you there?
Frank, we need to talk...
 John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
 Dad, what the hell is going on?
 Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
I think you know, Frank.
No, I don't.
Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
About what?
Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
Okay.  It's okay, Bud.  I'll be right back.  Stay there, John.
Where were you last night, Frank?
What do you mean?
Do you know where I found this?
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
No.  This isn't what you think.
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.
Trust me, Bud.  Do that for me.
John, you there?
 Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
Frank.
...you gotta help me, Chief.
That's not the deal, Frank.  Don't do this to your family.
Dad!  Dad!  What's going on?  Satch?!
Carl Shepard.  Detective out of the 15th precinct.
I swear, Satch.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Uh, huh.
Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone?
Give me a little time with this guy.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
How's that?
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
Frank, please...
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Frank, this is insane...
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
His wife is here.  She wants to talk to you.
Whatta you want me to tell her?
She's in harm's way.  He's gonna be coming for her.
Promise me, as a friend.  October 22, don't let her out of your sight.
 Let's walk, get a cup of coffee.
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
Yeah.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
They around?
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
I'll go find Hayes.
On your feet.
Now turn around, face the wall.
How did you know?
 You twisted animal...
Evidence says you're the animal.  That's why you hung yourself.
You try putting that thing around my neck and I'll rip your throat out.  You want me dead, use the gun.
Let me draw you a picture.  You live at 1060 41st Ave.  You have a wife who works at New York Hospital.  And a six-year old at P.S. 130.
What the hell is going on here?
You got to help me.  He's trying to kill me.
Mind if we take it outside?
 I'll be right back.
...didn't mean t step on your toes.  They sent me up from downstairs, I thought you'd be in there with him.
What are you looking at him for?
Yeah, half the uniforms are either at the game or on the street.  It's gonna be a riot if they pull it off.
 What's the score?
Cleon Jones thinks he's hit.  I think the ball hit him in the foot...
Hadges is coming outta the dug out.  He's calling for the ball.  Can we get a shot of the ball?
Can you excuse me for a second?
There's a scuff mark on the ball!  The umpire has reversed his decision.  He's sending Jones to first base!
 You mind I go back at teh fire boy for a while?  I won't lay a hand on him, just want to see what he's got?
Go ahead, knock yourself out.
What's going on, Satch?
 I don't know.
 He was right!  Everything he said.  He was telling the truth.
Then you believe him?
Yeah I do.  You bet your life I do.
I'm on my way...
 Wait here, I'll send a uniform.
 Elvis has left the building.
 Hell-
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
Who the fuck is this?
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Sullivan?
You have the right to speak to an att --
Fuck you, asshole.
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
 17th Precinct.
Detective Deleon.
 Hold on.
Deleon.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
 Hello?
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Next time lets put some money on it.
 Get him home safe.
Hey, bud.
Frank...
 John, John?  You there?  Johnny?
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
What's wrong?
I don't remember.  Why don't I remember?
Dad?  Dad?  What's...
My turn to steal your life.
You're a clever fuck, fireboy.
Time to meet the family.
 This is between you and me.
Not any more.
Hey, Bud.  Want to join me?
Sure do.
Nice.
Get your fucking hands off my wife.
Don't.  Don't do it, Frank.  You're not a killer.
You were the kid.  I remember now.
But this time, no Daddy.
I'm still here, Chief.
 Take it easy on him son, he's older than Moses.
Bring me home, son!  Bring me home!
Hey there, Chief.
Elvis has left the building...
