Rightly or wrongly, for better or worse, the counselors defined themselves quickly. No one more so than Wendy. First week of camp, the perky girl who knows all the rules and all the songs is pretty much Queen.

Jasper was seemingly shy, but actually sly. A lot more than met the eye.

Pixel gleefully answered all the dirty questions a good counselor would uncomfortably ignore. It was dangerous to try and figure Pixel out. She herself wisely never tried. Others would.

A collection of individuals separated from regular society eventually becomes something more than a collection of individuals separated from regular society. It becomes one mammoth living organism. Different traits of different people feeding off and flowing into each other--the naive and the perverse, the brutal and the sweet, the overconfident and the overwhelmed-- all coming together to form one singularly special whole.
An organism made up of 70 screaming kids counseled by young adults at the most fucked-up point in their lives is a monster well worth a glance. Welcome to Camp Bleeding Squaw.

 Gee guy, coming from you, that's..disturbing. Wendy and I...come on. I believe in nothing. She believes in everything. I listen to Reznor, she listens to Barney. I watch...
 Man, you're doth protesting way too much. Admit you want her.

You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...

We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important.

Camp Eberhardt. Anne Wilson, lovely Anne Wilson. She was the only camper to have a lifeguard's license so she was the only one allowed to take out a canoe without supervision.
