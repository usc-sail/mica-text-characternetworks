Helluva talent, that kid.
Probably be in the bigs in another year.
Zach? Are you ready? Mommy, can't be late again.
I'm ready.
Come on baby. Don't do this to mommy. Not today.
I don't want to go. Melanie hastily dresses her son.
Zach, do you want mommy to get fired?
Yes.
If I get fired we won't have the money to go to Six Flags. Zach quickly dresses himself. CUT TO:
Must be something to have that kind of talent. He's just a kid, nineteen, twenty tops, and if he stays healthy and he stays focused, the world is his oyster. Guys like you and me, we squandered those opportunities long ago.
You.
Huh? JOHN Guys like you...
And me...
... squandered opportunities. I, on the other hand, knew where I was going. I had that kind of drive, I just never had the talent.
You knew where you were going?
Absolutely.
At nineteen?
Without question.
The only thing I knew for certain was that I would run to the corner store every day for beer.
Lock your door. I'll be right back. Melanie opens her door.
Mom?
What?
I'm not thirteen. It's against the law to leave me alone in a car until I'm thirteen.
Come on.
I had priorities. I understood what it meant to have an attention span.
You could focus?
I was the King of Focus.
The Duke of Diligence?
The Count of Concentration.
Duck.
Huh?
The Polestar Prince.
Did you decide? ZACH I want Coke.
Get one.
No, Pepsi.  No, Seven-Up. Maybe root beer.
Make up your mind already.
So many choices. A glance to her watch.
I'm just saying grow up. You can't keep drifting. RICK I thought I did grow up...
When you got married?
Yeah...
You matured a little.
It's a process.
No Bueller, it's a decision. One you need to make. You can't keep running without direction. If you don't know where you're going you'll never get what you want. CUT TO:
I want Sobe.
Too bad.
I don't want Coke. I want Sobe.
 We'll take the soda.
Two dollars and... MELANIE Hold on a minute. Please?
Come on lady.
Get your Sobe.
I thought I got direction...
When Cindy had kids? RICK Yeah...
They gave you purpose. But purpose, my friend, is not direction.
East.
Huh?
My direction is east. I parked in the deck.
I'm right around the...
Corner?
Yeah.
We're always going in different directions. JOHN Mine are much more productive.
And much less adventurous.
Well, I'm gonna...
Go?
Yeah.
Then go.
That's what I'm going to do. Responsibility calls. John turns and heads south. Rick takes a bite of popcorn, looks to the sky for a moment, grins, and heads off Northeast.
Sobe sucks. I want Coke.
You want to...
Get a beer?
Yeah.
Can't. JOHN Can't?
Gotta get home.
Why?
Family, my man. Take time off for a ballgame ya should probably tend to the family too. You should try it sometime.
In the grand scheme of things family is a liability, not an asset. Rick continues on.
 Do you even know what you're doing or where you're going?
 East.
East leads nowhere, my friend. You should be heading south. The bar is south. East takes you places you don't want to go.
You're late.
I know, but...
No buts. You're late. MELANIE But...
It's the third time this week Mel. You put me in a rough spot here. My boss wants me to let you go. His boss wants me to let you go. I gotta let you go.
But...
If a person isn't responsible enough to be prompt to their job, they're not responsible enough to work for me.
But... BOSS You're fired Mel. Just get your things and go.
We still on for dinner?
Is that...?
You think...?
Naw...
Can't tell from here...
Too far away. Let's roost him. OFFICER TWO Call it in.
It's him... get him, get him, get him. They curb the car in front of Rick.
Get em up. Up I said... up.
Huh?
Get `em where we can see `em slimeball.
Oh, we got ourselves a litterbug here.
What?
What's going...
Shaddup!
You know your rights, cretin, but just in case you don't...
What the hell? Officer Two spins Rick to face him.
You have the right to shut the hell up. Do you understand this right?
Yes.
Shut him the hell up, Jimmy.
If you don't shut the hell up my partner might exercise his right to shoot you. Do you understand?
He's looking at me funny, Jimmy.
You have the right not to look at my partner in any way that might be construed as `funny' which could result in harm to your person. Do you understand this right?
He twitching?
Really? I don't think he is. Are you twitching boy? RICK No Sir.
Look at him, he's twitching. Nothing pisses me off more than twitching and talking. If he doesn't stop I'm gonna waste him.
You have the right not to twitch or shiver or make any other odd movements that might encourage my partner to discharge his weapon, do you understand?
You never answered about tonight.
You're making a huge mistake.
What do we got here boys?
It's him. We got him.
He's a twitcher... a twitcher and a talker. Boy, I tell you, if he'd twitched one more time I would've deposited large amounts of hot lead in his ass.
I'll take it from here boys. OFFICER TWO Report too?
No, that's your job.
If we have to write the report I say I get to shoot him.
No one's getting shot today, Bobby.
Can't I just wing him or something?
Jimmy; get him out of here.
Tell me I'm not responsible... asshole. I have a kid. He has a goldfish. I have my dignity. 
He has a brown ring on his collar. He's nothing more than a turd with feet.
You don't want to piss Bobby off. He's a little unstable.
A little? He represents your force? DETECTIVE JOHNSON Affirmative action. We have to hire our fair share of disabled --- Quota thing.
His psychosis doesn't appear disabling.
Where's Zach?
Fired again? MELANIE I don't want to talk about it.
The first thing I learned when I retired was that time management is an asset.
Take your time, Ma'am. We need you to be certain.
Turn to your left. The men follow their instruction.
Back to front.
All of you face forward. The two turn forward.
Are you sure? LADY IN BLACK Could you have him step forward?
Number three take two steps forward.
You're positive?
Okay number three step back. Rick does as he's told. DETECTIVE JOHNSON Turn to your right --- all of you...
...and exit.
Order in the court.
Order in the court, I say.
Have a seat.
Do you know why you're here today, Mr. Stevens?
Why am I here?
Are you being rhetorical?
Are you asking me?
You stand here today an accused man.
Accused? Accused of what?
You have been placed in custody of your children.
Huh?
Your children, Mr. Stevens. You do realize you have children, don't you?
Yes, but...
But nothing Mr. Stevens, either you have children or you don't.
I do.
So, you accept responsibility for bringing young life into the world?
I guess...
There's no guessing, Mr. Stevens, either you're responsible for siring offspring or you aren't.
I am, but I'm not sure it was responsible.
A crime of passion, Mr. Stevens? How convenient.  And you accept the consequences of said actions? RICK Why am I here?
Why are you here, Mr. Stevens? Why are you here? I'll tell you why you're here. Are you familiar with Ms. Cynthia Stevens?
Yeah, she's my wife.
Was your wife, Sir. Was your wife. She recently filed for divorce. Were you aware of that?
No, no I wasn't.
Well, she did. She also named you as her coconspirator in the act of having children. Were you aware of that, Mr. Stevens?
Again, no.
Mr. Stevens, you just told the court that you aware you had children. You have also admitted that Ms. Cynthia Stevens was, in fact, your wife. 
Yes, but...
Then why, Mr. Stevens, do you continue to deny culpability in this situation?
Answer the question.
Answer the question.
The question, Mr. Stevens.
How can you be sure it was me?
She picked you out of a lineup, Sir. What more do you need?
Time. PROSECUTOR Time is not an option, Mr. Stevens. Time --- is not --- an option.
You don't deny being married to Ms. Stevens, nor do you deny the act of procreation. You seem to understand that your actions bear consequence. You seem to understand that with parenthood, came responsibility. 
Yes, yes I did.
It's time to pay the piper, Mr. Stevens.  It is the recommendation of the State that Richard C. Stevens been sentenced to the fullest capacity allowed by law.
What about Cindy?
Excuse me?
My ex, Cindy, what about her responsibilities to the children?
She cut a deal, Rick. You were the one we wanted. You were the one we got. She took the plea. Sure, it costs her financially. But what is freedom worth? A CLAMOR begins to rise from the crowd as they talk among themselves. The RAP of the gavel.
I see no reason to extend this any further. Mr. Stevens you have been found competent by the State and by this Court. You are completely cognizant of your surroundings, and you leave me no choice. This court finds you guilty as charged.
Guilty of what?
You are hereby remanded to custody of your children for no less than a lifetime. This Court is adjourned.
I can't do this alone. Don't make me do this alone. I'll never make it...
If you can't do the time, Mr. Stevens, then don't do the crime.
Highly Effective Strategies of Time Management for the Single Parent?
Learn it. Live it.
It was written by a man... a married man.
Lots of single parents are married.
Daddy!
Hi guys.
I love you daddy.
I love you too, Phillip.
I love you more.
I love you more.
I love YOU more.
Daddy, how come you're in jail?
Is this where we live?
When can we see mommy?
Come here guys. I want to talk to you. The boys gather round.
What's wrong Daddy?
I don't know when we're going to see your mom again. KRIS Is she okay?
She's kind of mad at daddy.
Mommy mad at me too?
No, baby, not at all. Your mom needs time to work through some things. So, for awhile, it's just going to be us...
What's she need time for?
To figure out who she is, where she's going, what she wants.
I miss mommy.
She misses you too, baby. And this isn't permanent... we're going to fight this... we're going to appeal. We'll take it to the Supreme Court if we have to. KRIS You don't want us either?
Of course I want you. I just don't think I should have to do this alone.
I feel for you, I really do, but I've seen your kind before. You're a lifer. Whether it's fair or not. Whether justice was served. It doesn't matter. You're here for the duration.
What's wrong mommy?
Nothing.
Why are you crying? Did I do something wrong?
Nothing at all baby.
 Tell me a story?
Once upon a time, a very long time ago...
Get yourself cleaned up.
Huh?
You have visitors... in the courtyard.
Quite the pickle you've got yourself in.
So it seems.
She was no good for you. I knew it from the start.
Mom, don't... okay?
Just saying...
I know, but what's done is done.
There's my boys.
You're dad and I are here for you.
I know mom.
Are you eating?
Yeah, I guess.
Do you need anything? Food? Money? RICK Watch the kids one night? I could use some time to myself.
Um... Yeah... okay... I suppose that would be all right... we'd have to ask your father, but I don't see why that would be a problem.  Other than that everything's okay?
We're okay...
Because it doesn't have to be like this. Mary Ryan, a friend of mine, her son had the same thing happen to him. Wife just up and left with no warning at all. He didn't waste a day. No sir, he was up and at `em almost instantly. You can leave here, you know? Mary Ryan's son did.
I like it here, mom. MOTHER What's to like? It's dingy and filthy. It's no place to raise children.
It's home and it's stable. The one thing the boys need right now is stability.
You can't keep hiding forever.
It's been five days, mom. I'm not hiding. I just need time to adjust.
Mary Ryan's son thinks you're hiding. RICK Do I know this guy?
No, but I think you should. I hate that woman. How can a mother abandon her kids? How could she do this to my babies?
Scott? Scott?
 Yeah baby?
I hope she's living in hell too.
What ya doing?
Looking for a job.
I know what you could do.
What's that?
You could stay home with me.
What do you pay?
Sixty-five cents.
A day?
A week.
You can afford that?
If it keeps my mommy home with me.
So, needless to say, I understand your situation. My old lady, she took off and left me with the kids five years ago. That bitch. But I'm not bitter or anything. I found me a good day care and moved on with my life. You should too.
It's hard...
Of course it's hard, sometimes feels like you're in prison, but you gotta be a man... stand up for yourself... provide for your family.
And you can help? FRANK Me? I'll put ya to work. Some long hours, but it all pays off. Keeps you off the welfare system if ya know what I mean.
Yeah.
I'd rather pay you than pay the government to pay you. You can start Monday.
Here's the number to the day-care. Tell them you know me, they'll cut you a break.
And when school starts we have a bus service that will take the two oldest to and from school. We have story hour at Eleven, lunch at noon, and nap time at Twelve- thirty. Rest assured our programs are designed to be nurturing, caring environments that provide the parental guidance your children need in those hours you can't be with them. So, are there any questions?
No, you seemed to cover everything. Ms. Heath bends down to the kid's level. MS. HEATH You're going to like it here.
 They'll be just fine.
I'm sorry. It would be really nice to have you on board, but you're just a little too qualified.
Too Qualified.
Over qualified.
You're just not qualified.
I don't think I've seen such a perfect candidate.
Really?
You are bad, bad children.
Education level. Work experience. You really fit the billet.
So, did everything go okay? PROVIDER They were angels.
Did you have fun boys?
Get those seat belts on. The kids reluctantly comply.
So, how was your day? BOYS IN UNISON
Didn't they feed you? They said they would feed you. The brochure said meals provided.
We didn't eat nuffin.
Daddy, I'm hungry.
Unfortunately we filled the position earlier today. WHIP PAN to cell doors slamming closed.
So, how was your first week?
Thirteen hours a day doesn't leave me much time for my kids, But a job's a job, right?
Now you're talking.
Two hundred and fifty bucks?
Pretty good, huh?
Two-hundred-and-fifty-bucks?
Don't spend it all in one place. RICK I give you sixty-five hours of my time and you give me two hundred fifty bucks?
It's the American way. This country was founded on low paying, back breaking, long hour jobs. Why, work like this makes you a bona fide patriot. Ya gotta love it.
 What's not to love?
That will be two hundred seventy- five dollars and thirty-six cents. RICK I'm a little short.
We take checks too.
Checks?
Those things you use when you don't have money.
I'm sorry, I'm clueless. My wife handled the checks.
Ah. RICK Does it help that I know Frank Ryan? He told me to mention his name.
You know Frank?
I work for him.
That changes everything.
Great.
Two hundred ninety-five dollars and thirty-six cents.
Huh?
Frank owes me money and one way or another, I will collect. RICK So, I'm forty-five dollars short...
And thirty-six cents. Don't worry about it. It's your first week. You didn't know, so, we'll let it ride and just add it to next week's balance. A beat as Rick turns to leave.
You know there is a way you could save quite a bit of money.
Really?
Potty train the toddler. Ms. Heath pulls some literature from her desk drawer.
Potty train? Nicky?
 The toddler.
Mommy?
Yes, baby?
When are we going to have a normal life.
We do have a normal life... for us.
I mean when are we going to be like other people? She pulls a flyer from the printer. CU. on flyer: BABY SITTING
Big boy go potty.
Are you a big boy?
Huge-mong-gus.
Big boys go potty on the potty, Nicholas. Nicholas go potty on the potty?
You're brothers go potty on the potty. Daddy goes potty on the potty. Nicholas go potty on the potty?
Daddy will buy Nicky a toy from the store.
Okay.
If Nicky goes potty on the potty.
I want a toy!
I have to go potty?
Really?
All done.
How's the potty training coming?
I think we're making progress.
Three hundred forty and...
Seventy-two cents. Here's two- fifty.
You're still short.
I know and I'm working on that.
May I remind you that we're not a charity? If you need credit go to a bank. I run a reputable business and I need the balance by next Wednesday, or maybe you should consider other arrangements.
I didn't do it.
What happened? Where is he? Is he going to be okay?
He's going to be fine. They're working on him now. From what they told me it's just a few stitches.
Boys will be boys. A NURSE peeks out.
Mr. Stevens can you come back? The doctor could use your help in calming the child down.
Mom? MOTHER Just go. I'll watch these two.
Thank God.
How can I help?
Well, I need to give him a local so that I can sew the laceration, but he's not cooperating. Maybe hold his hand and distract him? Rick moves to Phillip.
Hi little buddy.
Hi Daddy.
I need you to be a good boy, okay?
Okay daddy.
So, did you have fun today.
Uh huh.
Did you play with all your friends?
Uh huh.
That fuckin' hurts! RICK Phillip!
But daddy, it does.
That's a big people word. You're a little people, and little people don't use big people words.
Okay.
 I'm sorry.
Do that again and my daddy's going to kick your ass.
Look I'm really sorry.
Can I ask you something?
Sure, I guess.
My son's a wuss. He cries over hangnails. My wife and I have tried everything to toughen him up, but nothing works. I was wondering if our kids could play together. Maybe some of Phillip's "boy" would rub off on Junior. CUT TO:
Insurance?
Yeah, Insurance. That thing that covers medical emergencies?
I don't think I have any.
Everybody has insurance.
I don't think I do.
Okay.
Can I run a tab?
You don't have a check?
I'm not even responsible for myself. How am I suppose to raise three kids?
It can be done.
I don't see how.
Find a way. Everything happens for a reason. God doesn't abandon his children, and neither will you.
God doesn't pay day-care.
There are other things out there... less expensive ways.
Could you watch them?
Oh... uh... well... I don't think your father is willing to do that. We raised our kids, Rick.
How `bout tonight, so I can catch a breath?
What? My watching them while you were in there with Phillip wasn't enough? Make me feel guilty.
I'll just ask God to watch them. He never abandons his children.
Take this.
I don't want your money mom.
Take the money.
I can't do it Daddy.
You can do it.
I can't do it.
Would you do it for a nickel?
I can't do it.
Watch daddy.
Daddy go potty in the potty.
Daddy?
Yes, Nicky?
I peed.
Hi.
I'm Melanie... The baby-sitter...
Oh, right, I'm glad you could...
My daddy has a big pee-pee.
I was just demonstrating the art of...
It's okay. I saw.
 Great.
You have a kid.
So do you.
Not criticizing, just surprised. I don't believe anyone at their old day-care had kids. If they did they kept them in a closet and only brought them out on special occasions. Christmas, Easter, an occasional birthday, and maybe when they had friends over for dinner, but only as a status symbol. It was like they'd say, "Here's the white picket fence. Here's the SUV. Here's the dog. Oh yes, here's the 2.5 children. Kids you can get back in the closet now."
You'd could make a fortune with a Renta- Kid business.
That has potential.
I've often thought of renting mine. Why pay for a baby-sitter when thousands of people would pay good money to set your kid on the mantle for a few hours?
So, what's his name? ZACH I'm Zach.
Hello Zach. I'm Rick.
You're old.
You got me there. I am old.
How old?
Older than dirt. When I was a kid we didn't have dirt. We had rocks and we had hammers. If we wanted dirt we banged a few rocks with really big hammers, and then we had dirt.
Worked the chain gangs?
You're too old for my mom.
This is Kristian. This is Phillip, and the little guy from the potty, is Nicholas. Guys, this is Zach and...
Mel.
Mel.
Beautiful kids. RICK Thanks. So's your's.
Ever try Cheerios?
Huh?
For potty training. Give him something to aim at. Drop a Cheerio or two in the toilet and let him pee away.
I'll have to try that. So, any questions about the job? Melanie moves towards the boys.
I'm going to go talk to them for a little bit. I'll let you know.
My mom tells great stories.
We don't have a mom.
That's okay, I don't have a dad.
Once upon a time...
The end...
We'll read another one in a little bit.
You have a real knack there.
Not a knack really. It's just about finding hope in places there should be none.
Whatever it is, I've never seen them take to a woman like that. Melanie smiles.
You want the job?
I'd like that.
You're really funny... and kinda cute.
Maybe we should...
Go out sometime? I'd like that. When?
I don't know... maybe...
Tonight?
No problem.
Who was that?
That was your daddy.
I love daddy.
Is he coming home?
No, he's going to be late. He has a date.
So, I guess you have to deal with me a little while longer.
You're a single father? That's wonderful. So many men refuse to accept any responsibility for their kids. So, how many do you have?
Um... three.
That's amazing. I'm sure they're just angels. CUT TO:
My sister has three. She said when the second one was born it doubled the work. She didn't realize the third would double the work load would again. And to think you do it all by yourself.
Um... kinda.
You're a terrific man. Did I tell you I love kids? They love me. It just comes so instinctively even though I've never had kids myself. I get lots of practice with my nephews though. So, when can I meet your boys?
You're not my mom.
You can't.
A guy like you is so hard to find. I think I love you and I think you need to love me too.
That was incredible.
Yeah. RICK I know I haven't known you very long, but I there's something I need to say...
 Was it something I said?
Did you have a good time?
Yeah, it was good... kinda okay... pretty much sucked.
What happened?
Why can't I find a woman like you?
You're trying too hard. RICK I feel bad for the boys. They don't have a "mom". She'll always be their mother, but she'll never be their mom.
Quit trying so hard. You're forcing issues that can't be forced. Relax. Everything happens when and how it's suppose to. It's about spirit and finding the will to love again, for you and the boys.
You want to stay and...
I'm going to get... RICK Going?
Yeah.
You sure?
Positive.
Daddy, I have to potty.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Ok.
Nicky almost do'd it.
Almost, baby boy. Almost.
Finally had to grow up?
Yeah, I...
You've got direction.
I suppose. I don't know if you'd call it direction, but there's a definite sense of purpose.
Good for you.
Yeah, but is it good for the kids?
Do the kids have direction?
RICK Only two kinds of people make it in this world, boy; Those that are smart and those that are strong. If you don't want to be smart and do your homework then you can be strong and do pushups.
I'm probably not as demanding of them as I should be.
You have to instill a sense of direction at a very early age. CUT TO:
So, Phillip what do you want to be when you grow up?
Daddy says I can do three things when I grow up.
And what are those? Phillip takes a deep breath.
I can go to college and move the hell out of his house. I can join the military and move the hell out of his house, or I can get a job and...
... move the hell out of my house.
Rick!
Ya gotta let them be what they're going to be.
No, you have to mold them early. If you don't mold them they'll grow up to be Democrats.
And you do this with your kids? JOHN That's not the point, is it, Carrie?
I think Rick is doing a wonderful job.
It's a struggle, going at it alone, but...
Excuse me, gentleman, I need to powder my nose.
I can't believe you.
What?
Whining about being single. Married men would kill to be in your situation! RICK I'm just saying it's hard.
You have your sons to raise without feminine interference. Do you understand the significance of your situation? Do you understand the power in your circumstance?
Men, all over the world, would kill for that kind of power.
You have the kids and she pays child support... and you sit here and whine about things being hard? Give me a break.
It does have its advantages, I suppose.
Another?
Uh...
On me.
Sure.
He went to grab a couple beers.
You know Rick, someday some girl is going to realize what a good man you are.
Carrie, I don't even have the funds to buy my own beer.
Love isn't about money. Love is about truth and selflessness and discovering who you are and who'll be. Someday, someone will find you.
I'll call you back.
What?
What was that for?
For finding me.
Have to potty, daddy.
Go potty, buddy.
I thank you for everything, but it's time to move on.
Where are you going? What will you do?
I don't know, Frank, but I'm worth more than this.
You'll never make it without me!
Phillip, what's wrong?
Well, I wanted that piece and Kris took that piece, and I really, really wanted that piece.
What's so important about that piece?
It's bigger.
Easy on the drinks guys.
What's wrong, Phillip?
I gotta pee and Kris...
We're not going to fight over the bathroom.  
Kris, your brother has to go too. Share!
What's that?
Huh? Oh, this? Nothing!
This time mine's bigger.
I'm really glad you could make it.
I took off work to be here.
Thank you.
So, what do you want?
I want to see your boys.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I'm their mother.
You forfeited that obligation, remember?
That's not fair! RICK You abandoned your kids!
I did not. I left them in the care of their loving father. There's a difference.
Is there?
I just want to see the boys.
You think they even know who you are?
I'm their mother.
You keep saying that.
I know things can never go back to the way they were before.
Next...
Rick? Rick? Rick?
Huh?
Let's keep the attorneys out of this and settle things like civil adults.
Hi guys.
This is a surprise. Leave work to spend the day with us?
Come on guys. Someone is here to see you.
Rick?  Rick?
Thank you.
Three hours.
They'll be here.
Where are you going.
Anywhere you're not.
What about the boys? What about me?
I'm all about second chances, but not when I come in second place.
What are you talking about?
Why was she here? What was that?
She's their mother.
Mother? I've been more of a mother than she ever was.
She's their mother.
Who willingly walked out of their lives.
She's their mother.
You keep saying that.
You think this is easy? You think raising these boys is something I want to do alone? Every day is like a prison sentence. Every thing I do, every decision I make is directly affected by the boundaries of my responsibility. I have three children, but I have no me. Everywhere I go people stare at me...
They stare at me, and I know what they're thinking...
You poor, poor man. You poor, poor children. How unfortunate to only have your father. How terrible it must be not to know your mother.
What about Zach? How noble of you to be the only single parent in the world. How stoic you are... so concerned with the best interests of your children. Too bad. Their best interest is walking out the door.
When can we see you again?
Someday.
Is someday tomorrow?
Someday is someday, baby.
Give your Mom a hug, guys, then get in the house.
For?
I thought things had changed.
But?
I am who I am, Rick. I'm not cut out to be a mommy.
I could have told you that.
I had to give it a shot. Rick turns to walk away.
At whose expense? Huh, Cindy? At whose expense? Who's going to dry their tears tomorrow when they realize your never coming back? Who's going to rock them to sleep at night when they ask why mommy doesn't love them?
You are, and you wouldn't have it any other way.
Is Mel coming today?
I don't know, buddy.
Daddy?
Yes Nicky?
I love Mel.
She loves you too.
Daddy... Daddy... Dad!
 Don't you yell! If you have something to say, come here and tell me.
Dad?
Yeah?
Phillip's in the closet
What were you doing in there?
Being Daddy.
Who locked the door?
Wasn't me...
I did.
Rick?... Rick?... Rick?
Take care of my babies.
What are you giving him money for?
To help him through the hard times. He's a good father, just having a rough go.
I've never met a good father that couldn't support his kids.
You could watch the boys while he works.
I'm too old for that. The better side of life has passed me by. What if they fall? I don't hear like I used to. What if one of them was seriously hurt and I didn't hear their cry? I hate that the only thing I feel competent to do is give them money. I love my son and I love my grandbabies, but how would I live with myself if something happened to those children?
Sir, you're 3 months behind on your electric bill.
It's a start, but not nearly enough.
I always knew you were a lifer.
Because of their age it may take awhile. We'll start them out in foster care, but eventually they'll all be placed in loving, nurturing environments.
They'll be together though, right?
Mr. Stevens, I wish I could make that promise, but the odds of an adoptive family willing to take them all is astronomical.
Come on guys we're out of here.
Mr. Stevens?
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
 Can I get some help here.
Can you help me?
Can you help him?
I don't know.
What does he need?
I don't know.
He needs a father, not a book reading baby-sitter.
 I can't fucking do this.
Yes you can.
Use your mind and your heart. It's different than it ever should have been... but different isn't wrong.
But I...
Use what you have. There is a vein of wealth inside you just waiting to be mined. Think differently than you have ever thought before. Worker harder than you ever thought you could. Love these children like they've never been loved before.
How?
The answer lies within. Quit worrying about how these misguided events have torn your life apart. Quit dwelling on all of your misgivings. Look around you. You're not alone. But you, and you alone, will make the difference.
It's not worth a lot, maybe a few hundred bucks, but it might keep you in soap for a year.
Mr. Stevens, I can see you now. Rick and the Pregnant Woman lock eyes.
I ain't some charity case. I know what you think when you look at me. You think; Look at that poor, poor woman. Look at those poor, poor children. How unfortunate it must be that they only have a mother. How terrible it must be not to know their father.
Mr. Stevens?
I didn't mean it like that?
No one ever does.
Mr. Stevens?
Mr. Stevens? I can see you now. RICK I'm sorry, I'm going to have to reschedule.
Excuse me?
Responsibility calls.
Please daddy? Please? Rick opens the book so all can see.
Once upon a time...
Daddy, I'm hungry.
It's very, very empty.
Daddy, I'm thirsty. Rick takes a long look at his beer.
Get your coats on.
We're leaving guys.
Thirty-two hundred and fifty-six dollars.
Think it's bad now? Wait til they're teenagers.
Mom, I have an idea, but I need your help.
Put your checkbook away. What I need you can't buy.
What do you need.
For you to believe in me.
I know you.
Excuse me?
Rick's ex-wife?
And you are?
Can I ask you a question? What is Phillip's favorite color?
Huh?
Blue. His favorite color is blue. How many teeth has Kris lost?
I don't know. Why?
Four. Two on top and two on bottom. He got a quarter for the first one, fifty cents for the next two and he parlayed the last into an even dollar. Nicholas cries at night because he thinks the house is filled with ghosts. Kiss him once on the forehead, once on the cheek and sing The Cradle Will Rock and he'll sleep the whole night through. Kris' favorite subject is math. He loves to read and write, but he doesn't do so well in social studies. He knows how to ride a bike. Why? Because I taught him. Phillip wants to learn but he's always afraid he'll fall. Nicky just likes to Flintstone his tricycle. Phillip's favorite cartoon is Tunenami. 
He's afraid of the dark and cries himself to sleep at night saying his mommy doesn't love him.
What's your point?
I'm more their mom than you'll ever be.
So, why are you here with slick and not with "your" kids?
MELANIE Things change.
Yeah... yeah they do. Now if you'll excuse me I need to find the asparagus.  I couldn't do it, ya know?
Do what?
I always thought I wanted to be a parent, and I was really good at being pregnant, but I sucked as a mom. I know that now. I don't have what it takes. MELANIE I don't think I've ever felt as much pity for anyone as I do for you right now.
Take care of my boys... all of them.
Well, guys, I guess this is it.
We can do it daddy.
Yes we can.
You can do it.
Yes we can.
What is it, Kris?
Look daddy.
We can do it.
 Yes we can.
Kris!
Hey!
What's wrong? What did I do?
Not you, it's me.
What then?
I'm sorry.
Put the stone down.
But...
No buts: Put the stone down.
I knew this was a hard climb, but... A RESTING CLIMBER appears.
Long way up.
Yeah.
Long way down for that matter.
That too.
So, what's your point.
No point, just an observation. Drink?
I'm okay.
For the boys.
Daddy, I'm thirsty. Rick studies the climber for a moment.
Go ahead.
You know, if you stop here, halfway between a long way up and a long way down you really haven't accomplished much, have you?
We're not stopping. We're just resting.
That's what I said, fourteen years ago. Rick looks toward the top. RICK We can do this.
Yes you can.
We can do this!
What is so important Mr. Stevens that you would burden this court with convening today?
I just needed clarification.
On what, Mr. Stevens? On what?
I know if I have to, I can do this alone, but do I have to do this alone? A hushed MURMUR rises in the audience. The Judge RAPS his gavel on the bench.
Order in this court! A beat as things quiet down.
Your inquiry, Mr. Stevens? Is it in the best interest of the children or in the best interest of you?
I don't know.
He doesn't know. He just doesn't know. RICK I don't know.
Then this court sees no reason to amend the original verdict. The order stands.
But...
Tell it to someone who cares, Mr. Stevens.
I have. I have laid my heart out on the line time and time again, only to walk away empty handed. This love, this caring, this sharing of life, it's a sentence and my heart has been condemned. It doesn't matter who I've told, what's in my heart is never quite enough. The people I have cared for most have shunned me in life and in love. Unanswered phone calls... Unnoticed displays of affection... A rose that withers on the doorstep... No matter what I do, it's never enough. Just once, just one fucking time, I want to be enough.
Your only condemnation is self- pity. You have people that care all around you, but you're too blind to see them. If you don't pull yourself together soon, my friend, they soon will all be gone.
What do you want?
I'm a proud man, sometimes foolish.
Go on.
I have a long way to go before I could ever be the man you need me to be.
And?
And I got confused between what I should have done and what I thought was right. MELANIE Yes you did.
I put you on a pedestal and then I knocked you down. It wasn't fair.
Life's not fair Rick.
You were more a mother to my boys than they have ever known. You were more a woman to me than I have ever deserved.
You're right.
You're not going to make this easy, are you? MELANIE Cut the bullshit, Rick.
 I can live my life alone. I can raise my kids alone. I can walk this path alone. I'd much rather do it with you.
I can't.
Can't?
 I won't.
I shouldn't have come here.
No, you shouldn't have.
You just don't get it do you?
Get what?
You're here for you, you selfish prick.
Days go by when I lose me. There are nights when I lay in bed and I can hear Zach through the walls. He's crying out for me, and I lay there motionless, wishing I was anyone but me, anywhere but here, thinking that somewhere, sometime, there has to be room for me. But that someday never seems to come. You're dangerous. Loving you means I lose me. And I will never lose let that happen. 
So, don't come knocking on my door, asking for my heart, if you don't have room for me.
I could have looked sad.
I can look sad too.
But I look sadder. NICHOLAS I sad.
Don't quit, daddy.
Daddy doesn't quit.
You love her?
I think so... I don't know.
If you think you're in love you are.
I suppose I am.
Does your heart skip a beat when she walks by?
She's my best friend... or was.
Does your heart skip a beat when she walks by?
Yes. JOHN Do your palms sweat when you think about her?
Yes.
Does she inspire you?
With music and poetry.
And is there passion?
There's fire.
And have you ever told her this? RICK She knows.
Have you ever told her this?
No.
Don't you think you should?
It only confuses things.
Loving your best friend confuses things? I can't think of a love more lucid. Rick stands to leave.
You know I'll never forgive you for this, don't you? You had the power and the dream at your fingertips and you're giving it all away.
You didn't marry your best friend?
No. RICK I thought you had things all planned out.
Affairs of the heart and those of the mind are two different things.
It's not too late, you know?
Go Home, John. Go home and talk to your best friend the way you talk to me.
I need you to watch the boys.
But you're father...
Woman, enough.
But...
No more excuses. It's time to live life and enjoy our grandkids.  Go. The boys will be fine.
Can't we just give him money to pay for a baby-sitter?
 Oh shit.
Whoa!
Sorry.
Pay attention, would ya?
What do you want? RICK To talk.
I'm working.
I know.
So, where are the boys?
They're at my parents.
What? Not going to use them to try to persuade me with guilt?
Is that what you thought?
I have a son of my own. I know when people are using their kids.
Ma'am. RICK  Excuse us for a moment okay?
I'd just like some coffee.
 Excuse me, Miss?
What is your problem?
Cold.
What?
The coffee, it's cold.
 Quit your bitching.
I can't believe you came here.
I can't believe you're a waitress.
Beats chasing around after snot nosed brats all day.
I thought you liked my kids.
I was talking about you. Melanie moves on. Rick gives chase. He catches her and spins her around spilling coffee all over the floor.
I deserved that.
So, what do the kids need? A babysitter? A surrogate mom?
This isn't about the kids.
Then what's it about?
It's about me, the selfish prick.
About you? RICK Hear me out, okay?
 You have 15 seconds.
Okay, okay.
Ten.
Melanie, there is a grace about you that reminds me how clumsy I am. There is an honesty about you that reminds me how deceitful I can be. There is a beauty in your eyes that reminds me how ugly I've become. There is a kindness in your voice that contradicts my coarseness. There is a glow around you that illuminates my dullness. There is spirit in you that challenges my laziness, but most of all, there is a woman in you, that sparks my desire, a desire to be graceful and honest and beautiful and kind. A desire to be better than I am or ever thought I could be.
Go on.
I think my ten seconds are up.
Who's counting?
Miss... My coffee?
Get it yourself.
I love you. MELANIE I don't think I heard you.
If I give you my heart will you promise to treat it softly? Kiss it when it hurts? Put it in a box and know that it belongs to you?
That's not what you said.
I said I love you.
As brutal as that can be?
I love you. I love you, I love you, I love you.
I kind of like you too.
MELANIE I never thought you'd make it.
Been waiting long?
I never thought you'd find me.
I had to find me first. I hope you plan on walking, cause I'm not sure I can carry you.
So, how do we do this? The two begin the ascent together.
One step at a time? MELANIE Side by side?
Maybe you could carry me?
Getting out of here, huh?
It's time to move on.
If you leave don't ever come back.
Not even... JAILER Not even on a visit. You're a very ugly man. I'd hate to explain to the other guards why you'd come to visit me.
Grandma?
Yes, Kris?
Grandma I love you.
I love her more.
I love her the whole universe.
I love you all the whole universe plus one.
So, this is where it all happened.
It's funny, the tricks the mind can play on you... but the Judge, he sat right over there... and the jury sat right there... and the audience was filled with all these people who didn't really give a shit about me.
A bunch of innocent bystanders?
And they all sat passing judgement on me, not knowing the situation, just staring over their schoolmarm spectacles and pointing their crooked fingers.
All the world's a stage.
Always casting dispersions.
Guilty as charged.
Did you hear that? RICK Hear what?
Nothing... nothing at all.
The secret of life, Melanie, is to always pay attention...
... always be prepared for what's right around the corner. The CRACK of the bat.
Duck!
Huh?
