With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula Caesar salad. For entres tonight I have a swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale...
And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...
We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California place on the Upper East Side.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
What do you mean?
Yes. Clarify.
Well, is it strictly informal-
Or can it be worn with a suit?
 Exactly
With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder vest.
But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look too studied.
You think so?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
 Did he just take our plates away?
He took them away because the portions are so small he probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place. This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia?
Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head. 
Is that Reed Robinson over there? PRICE Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson.
Who is it then?
That's Paul Owen.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
Who is he with?
 Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.
They don't have a good bathroom to do coke in.
Are you sure that's Paul Owen over there?
Yes. McDufus, I am.
He's handling the Fisher account.
Lucky bastard.
Lucky Jew bastard.
Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to do with anything?
Listen. I've seen the bastard sitting in his office on the phone with CEOs, spinning a fucking menorah. The bastard brought a Hanukkah bush into the office last December.
You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a menorah. You spin a dreidel.
Oh my God. Bateman, do you want me to fry you up some fucking potato pancakes? Some latkes?
No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.
Oh I forgot. Bateman's dating someone from the ACLU.
The voice of reason. The boy next door. And speaking of reasonable...
Only $470.
 Not bad.
Last week I picked up this Vassar chick-
Oh God, I was there. I don't need to hear this story again.
But I never told you what happened afterwards. So okay, I pick up this Vassar chick at Tunnel-hot number, big tits, great legs, this chick was a little hardbody-and so I buy her a couple of champagne kirs and she's in the city on spring break and she's practically blowing me in the Chandelier Room and so I take her back to my place-
Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is during all this?
Oh fuck you. I want a blowjob, Bate-man. I want a chick who's gonna let me-
 I don't want to hear this. He's going to say something disgusting.
You prude. Listen, we're not gonna invest in a co-op together or jet down to Saint Bart's. I just want some chick whose face I can sit on for thirty, forty minutes.
Anyway, so we're back at my place and listen to this. She's had enough champagne by now to get a fucking rhino tipsy, and get this-
She let you fuck her without a condom?
This is a Vassar girl. She's not from Queens. She would only-are you ready?  She would only give me a handjob, and get this...she kept her glove on.
I suppose he doesn't want the car. Price, ask him if he takes American Express.
 You take Amex, dude?
velvet rope and welcomes them inside.
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
I'm shaking. You open it.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
Maybe it's just the light.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? (He dips the corner of his Amex card in the packet and takes a snort) Oh my God...
What?
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
 SHUT UP!
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
I guess you're right...  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
 No, FUCK YOU!!  Sorry, dude. Steroids...Okay, let's do it.
That's the spirit.
It's after eleven. Those aren't good anymore. It's a cash bar. That'll be twenty-five dollars.
My name is Patrick Bateman. I am twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse.
I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now.
After I remove the icepack, I use a deep pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.
Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.
I always use an after-shave lotion with little or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by a final moisturizing "protective" lotion...
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there.
It is hard for me to make sense on any given level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality is sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is persistent.
My conscience, my pity, my hopes disappeared a long time ago, if they ever did exist.
Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.
Late?
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
When?
After six.
Negative. Cancel it.
Oh? And what should I say?
Just...say...no.
Just say no?
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
 Yes, sir.
Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight tonight.
Oh, something. . romantic?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
I'll do it.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
You look nice today.
Yes?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
 You don't like this, I take it?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
 Thanks, Patrick.
I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels.
I'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something ethnic to shock Daddy Oh, I can't decide...And lots of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters on the halfshell.
I'm trying to listen to the new George Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fiance-keeps buzzing in my ear.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
 Do...what.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Evelyn?
Yes, darling?
Is your Evian spiked?
We should do it.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Because I...want...to...fit...in.
I'm on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at Espace since I'm positive we won't have a decent table, but we do, and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.
The menu's in braille.
I have to talk to you.
 Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
 Hi. Pat Bateman.
Let me guess-you live in the East Village?
SoHo.
 Stop it!
I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know. Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs. Tonight I believe it's Xanax. More disturbing than her drug use, though, is the fact that she's engaged to Luis Carruthers, the biggest dufus in the business.
Tell me. Stash...do you think SoHo is becoming to...commercial?
Yes, I read that.
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?
Hey. That affects us.
 Oh ho ho. That affects us? What about the massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn't that affect us, too? I mean don't you know anything about Sri Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like tons of Israelis there? Doesn't that affect us?
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
Like what?
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
We also have to control the influx of illegal immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have to promote general social concern and less materialism in young people.
Patrick, how thought-provoking.
Why don t you just go for Price?
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
He's rich.
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Everybody has a great body now.
What do you want to do with that, floss with it?
Are you using minoxidil?
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
It's not.
Hello.
Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait... you're not giving me valid reasons.
What are you trying to say to me?
Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee? Bleach-ee. Oh my God.
 Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question. Two.  Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very expensive sheets and I really need them clean.
If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill you, are you understanding me?
Now listen-I have a very important lunch meeting  at Hubert's in thirty minutes, and I need those ...no wait, twenty minutes. I have a lunch meeting at Hubert's in twenty minutes with Ronald Harrison and I need those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.
This is crazy. You're a fool. I can't cope with this.
Stupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ!
Patrick?
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Hello 
Well.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
touches it and the woman behind the counter begins talking again.
Oh my, I see. What are those? Oh my. BATEMAN Um, well...it s cranberry juice. Cranapple.
Really?
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
 Next Saturday?
 Yeah.
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matine of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
Okay. Do.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Stop it. I'm...
On a lot of lithium?
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Pumpkin?
Yes?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Uh huh.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
I know. Stop it.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Courtney? Dinner?
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Nice?
You like it there, don't you?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Eight?
Pick me up?
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
Dorsia. Please hold.
Dorsia.
 Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
Is that Donald Trump's car?
 Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children... 
J&B. Straight.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Are we here?
Yes.
This is Dorsia?
 Yes, dear.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
 I want you to fuck me.
Luis is a despicable twit.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Is it a what?
Pull out.
I'm ignoring you.
 Pull out, goddamnit!
 What do you want, Courtney?
It's a plain end. I think.
Turn the light on.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Take it off.
Why?
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
 Do you think you're turning me on by having unsafe sex?
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
 Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Oh God, just get it over with.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
Lucky, I guess.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Uh huh.
 It looks so soft.
 Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
 Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
I've been great. And you?
Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam. It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P and in fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have a slightly better haircut.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
 It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Oh well, you know.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Hey. Owen! Congratulations on the Fisher account.
Thank you, Baxter.
Listen, Paul. Squash?
Call me. 
How about Friday?
No can do. Got a res at eight-thirty at Dorsia. Great sea urchin ceviche. There is a stunned silence as he walks away and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying papers.
 Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How'd he swing that?
I think he's lying.
 What's that, a gram?
New card. What do you think?
Whoa. Very nice. Take a look.
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
Good coloring.
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
 Silian Rail?
It is very cool, Bateman. But that's nothing.
Look at this.
That's really nice.
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
 Nice.
 Jesus. This is really super. How'd a nitwit like you get so tasteful?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
 Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark...
Hello. Pat Bateman.
You want some money?. Some...food?
Is this what you need?
I'm so hungry.
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
I'm so hungry.
 Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
 I lost my job...
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
I'm so hungry.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
I'm not...
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
I'm hungry
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
I'm hungry.
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
What am I gonna do?
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Al.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
 Shhhh...it's okay.
 Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
 Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common with you.
Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are?
There's a quarter. Go buy some gum.
What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman. So fine, so smooth...
I have all the characteristics of a human being- flesh, blood, skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable emotion except for greed ,und disgust. Something horrible is happening inside me and I don't know why.
My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy.
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
No, I want to know. I came here for the cilantro crawfish gumbo, which is after all the only excuse one could have for being in this restaurant, which is by the way, almost completely empty. Am I to believe that all ten people in this restaurant have eaten your entire supply of cilantro crawfish gumbo?
I'm very sorry sir. There was a fire in the kitchen earlier today, and-
J&B, straight. And a Dixie beer.
Would you like to hear-
Double Absolut martini.
Yes, sir. Would you like to hear the specials?
Not if you want to keep your spleen.
This is a real beehive of, uh, activity, Halberstam.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
Nobody goes there anymore.
Is that Ivana Trump over there?  Jeez Patrick I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana be at Texarkana?
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Paul Owen is very drunk. BATEMAN cold sober.
I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane?
Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive. Where do you tan?
I've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
Cecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Another Martini, Paul?
 Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
 The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost. Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall. He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen from behind ail the time.
He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor.
Hey, Halberstam?
Yes, Owen?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
No, Owen.
 Is that a raincoat?
Yes, it is.
In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is "HiP To Be Square," a song so catchy that most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself.
Hey, Paul?
 Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking stupid bastard!
 Fucking bastard...
Patrick? Is that you?
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Commes des Garcon.
Call me please, Patrick.
Jesus lives, Luis.
Where to send the bastard? Dallas? Pans?
Singapore? London. I'll send the asshole to London.
Hi, this is Paul. I've been called away to London for a few days. Meredith, I'll call you when I get back. Hasta la vista, baby.
 What is it?
Patrick?
 Ye-es, Je-an?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Who?
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
 Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end.
Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties...
 Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent.
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
 Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
 Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
 So, what's the topic of discussion?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Coffee?
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
No, I'm okay.
Patrick?
Can you bring Mr...
KIMBALL.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh no, I'm okay.
It's no problem
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Understandable.  Lime?
No, really. I'm okay.
You sure? I can always get you a lime.
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Shoot.
How old are you?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
 Where did you go to school?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Your address?
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
 Nice. Very nice.
 Thanks.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Who do you ask?
You seem...nervous.
Nuprin?
Bad habit.
I know. I'm sorry.
Would you rather I not smoke?
No, I guess it's okay.
You sure?
No problem. 
Yes, Patrick?
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
Well...
How well did you know him?
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Yale thing?
Yeah...Yale thing.
What do you mean...Yale thing?
Well, I think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine...that Yale thing.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
No. Not really.
 Where did Paul hang out?
Hang...out?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
He had a yacht?
No, he just hung out there.
And where did he go to school?
Don't you know this?
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
I understand.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
We were both seven in 1969.
 So was I.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Actually, yes.
Hmmm.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Oh.
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
What?
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
Have you consulted a psychic?
No.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
That's so typical, isn't it?
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Nothing.
People just...disappear.
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Eerie. Really eerie.
 You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Yes. It's very good.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
You like that, slut?
You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white cotton T-shirt by Commes des Garcons.  My Rolex cost-
 I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do you think of that?  Huh, bitch?
Dad, is that you?
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been looking.
Would you like to see my apartment?
 I'm not supposed to.
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Do you take American Express?
Do you take American Express?
I'm joking. Come on, get in.
I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really can't stress blonde enough. Blonde.
That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking.
I want you to clean your vagina.
No. From behind. Get on your knees.
I want to watch. You have a very nice body.
Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out and dry off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and our guest in the living room for drinks.
You've arrived! How lovely, let me take your coat. I'm Paul. How good of you to come.
Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty blonde. I'm going to call you Sabrina. I'm Paul Owen.
So, don't you want to know what I do?
No.
 No, not really.
Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce & Pierce.  Have you heard of it?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
No, no smoking. Not in here.
Varda truffle?
I don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.
Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out another one.
I think "Invisible Touch" is the group's undisputed masterpiece.
It's an epic meditation on intangibility, at the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christie, take off the robe.
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?
Take the lyrics to "Land of Confusion." In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political authority.
"In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock.
Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your asshole.
Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially songs like "In the Air Tonight" and "Against All Odds." Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.
But I also think that Phill Collins works better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and I stress the word artist. This is "Sussudio," a great, great song, a personal favorite.
Don't touch the Rolex.
We're not through yet...
What an asshole.
Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a fucking drug addict. No self-control.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
I know her. I knew her.
Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it like that?
Because he dated her.
How did you guess?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other reason.
If they have a good personality, then something is very wrong.
If they have a good personality and they are not great looking-who fucking cares?
Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if they have a good personality?  I know, I know-
A good personality consists of a chick with a little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut.
Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly chicks.
Absolutely.
And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
So what did Ed say?
He said, "When I see a pretty girl walking down the street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat her right."
What does the other part of him think?
What her head would look like on a stick.
 Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on something.
Yes, I do. No, it's my business card-I decided to get a new one too.
Listen, what about dinner?
 Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
Ah, cheer up, Bateman.  What's the matter? No shiatsu this morning?
 Keep touching me like that and you'll draw back a stump.
Whoa, hold on there, little buddy.
Excuse me.
Is this tap water? I don't drink tap water Bring me an Evian or something, okay?
God, Patrick. Why here?
I've seen you looking at me. I've noticed your hot body.
Don't be shy.
You don't know how long I've wanted it. Ever since that Christmas party at Arizona 206. You know the one, you were wearing that red-striped paisley Armani tie.
I want you. I want you...too.
 What...is...it?
Where are you going?
 I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Patrick?
What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
Maybe.
What are you doing tonight?
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.
You and...Luis?
 We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
I never knew you smoked.
 You never noticed.
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
 Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Yes, Courtney?
If I don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a nice one, okay?
 You too.
Patrick?
Yes?
Nothing.
Mr. Bateman?
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
Don.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" (He makes quotation marks in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh)
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
 Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
Some people just can t help themselves. Another Stoli?
I mean they want to get caught.
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
Rasta Man!
I mean-Mon. We be jammin'...
I have to talk to these girls? They're models.
Someone has to get the Bolivian marching powder. You went last time. Stay here.
 Let's have a conversation. So...it was hot out today, no?
Where did Craig go?
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott is going to sign a peace treaty with him between the United States and Russia. McDermott's the one behind glasnost, you know.
Well...yeah. But he told me he was in mergers and acquisitions.
You're not confused, are you?
No, not really.
Gorbachev's not downstairs.
 Are you Iying?
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
 Ask me a question.
So, what do you do?
What do you think I do?
A model? An actor?
No. Flattering, but no.
Well...
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
Do you like it?
Welt...it depends, why?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
So, where do you work out?
 I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Leaving what?
This.
Don't, I'll drink it.
 Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
 Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
Hey-don't worry, be happy.
Goodbye! Fuckheads!
Price! Come back!
My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn't understand what I was doing with a yuppie.
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
That's...that's too bad.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
What?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
No. I really don't.
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
Doin' the crossword?
Need help?
Jean?
 Yes, Patrick?
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Oh no. I have no plans.
 Well, isn't this a coincidence.
Listen, where should we go?
Anywhere you want?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
What about...Dorsia?
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Dorsia is...fine.
Dorsia, yes?
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
We are totally booked.
Oh really? That's great.
I said we are totally booked.
Two at nine? Perfect.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
See you then.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
You didn't give them a name.
They know me.
Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock for drinks, okay?
And Jean? You'll want to change before we go out.
Patrick, it's so...elegant. What a wonderful view.
Jean? Sorbet?
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
Want a bite?
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
 You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
So listen, what do you really want to do with your life?
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No, not really.
Interesting.
 Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Who's Ted Bundy?
Forget it.
What's that?
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
 What...No! Put it in the carton.
Sorry. 
Jean? What?
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
Hmmmm.
Patrick I know you're there. Pick up the phone, you bad boy. What are you up to tonight? It's me. Don't try to hide. I hope you're not out with some little number you picked up because you're my Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Anyway you never called me and you said you would and I'll leave a message for Jean about this too to remind you but we're having dinner with Melania and Taylor-you know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar, auld Taylor, he went to Cornell-and we're meeting at the Cornell Club, so l'll call you tomorrow morning probably-bye, honey-oopps! You hate that. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO Patrick. Bye. Bye.
Was that...Evelyn?
Are you still seeing her?
I'm sorry, I have no right to ask that.
Do you want me to go?
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
Kimball-I've been wanting to talk with you, Come into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Not really.
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
What?
That's not the information I've received.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Let's see...  That you were with-
Well, I could he wrong.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
 We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I just bought it on my way here.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
Not a big music fan, eh?
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
I'll be there.
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
I don't think so.
Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute.
Nothing like last time, promise.
Alright.
 So, you're looking great, how have you been?
 Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
 Really?
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
Bitch.
Uh uh uh. Half now, half later.
Okay, your name is Christie. We're meeting a friend of mine, Elizabeth. She'll be joining us in my new apartment shortly. You'll like her. She's a very nice girl. Don't say anything about yourself. Is that clear. Christie?
You look really familiar. Did you you go to Dalton?
I think I met you at Au Bar, didn't I ? With Spicey?
Well, maybe not with Spicey but it was definitely at Au Bar.
You know, Au Bar?
Anyway, Au Bar sucks now, it's terrible. I went to a birth day party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh my God, please.
This is nicer than your other apartment.
 It's not that nice.
Where did you two meet?
Oh God! I met him at, oh God, the Kentucky Derby in '86-no, '87, and...  You were hanging out with that bimbo Allison Poole.  Hot number.
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
She's my...cousin.
 Uh huh?
She's from...France.
Where's your phone? I've got to call Harley.
Where do you summer? Southampton?
No.
 Oh God, it's his machine.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Don't tell him you're here.
Why would I?
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
 You're at Paul Owen s.
Who?
 Paul Owen.
I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
No.
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
 Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
 Does he do this all the time?
Christie, you're not drinking your wine.
 Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
 It's hard to choose a favorite track among so many great ones, but "The Greatest Love of All" is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation and dignity. It's universal message crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder. Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in the world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves.
It's an important message, crucial, really, and it's beautifully stated on the album.
Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking face, you piece of bitch trash!
I want a firm commitment.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
 Why? What's wrong?
 My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
 Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
 I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
You're really serious, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
But what about the past? Our past?
We never really shared one.
You're inhuman.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
No, no, no.
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
 What do you want me to do, what is it you want?
 If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
 Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.
But where?
I have to return some videotapes.
Here kitty, kitty.
Oh my God! Stop that! What are you doing?
HALT STOP. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPON.
Halt. Put down your weapon.
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith? You forgot to sign in.
Harold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman. You're my lawyer so I think you should know-I've killed a lot of people. Some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some homeless people, maybe five or ten, an NYU girl I met in Central Park. I left her in a parking lot, near Dunkin' Donuts. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun. and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I killed another girl with a chainsaw-I had to, she almost got away There was someone else there, maybe a model, I can't remember but she's dead too. And Paul Owen. I killed Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything out here...I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even... well, I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little. Tonight I just, well, I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not sure I 'm going to get away with it this time-I mean I guess I'm a pretty sick guy. So-if you get hack tomorrow, I may show up at Harry's Bar, so, you know, keep your eyes open.
 No hash browns?
Not in the mood, I guess.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
 Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
 Suit yourself, I guess.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
And?
I've questioned him.
Marcus?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
But Marcus denied it?
Yes.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Yes.
He does? You're sure?
 I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
 Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
So who was he with?
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and  - you.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
KIMBALL! How's the investigation? Talking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says.  Bateman, what's wrong with ,you?
You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky without ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a raving maniac. Been at Pierce & Pierce too long.  No fucking hash browns...
What can I do for you, sir?
20B.
Of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now.
Mrs. Wolfe?
The real estate agent? You do have an appointment, don't you?
Are you my two o'clock?
No.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
Doesn't he live here?
No, he doesn't.
Are you sure?
You saw the ad in the Times?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
There was no ad in the Times.
I think you should go now.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Don't come back.
I won't...don't worry.
Hey, Kinsley.
See you at Fluties, okay?
Patrick Bateman's office.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Where are you?
Jean-I'm not-
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
What are I doing?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
...to the office this afternoon.
Why?
 Just...say...no!
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough day at the office?
Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't get a reservation to save his life.
Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them.
 I'm not going anywhere unless we have a reservation.
Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders.
 Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
Shut up, Carnes, they will not.
So, Harold, did you get my message?
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
 Yes, naturally.
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
What exactly do you mean?
The message you left.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Excuse me. Nothing. Good to see you. Is that Edward Towers?
Carnes? Wait.
 Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
 Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Excuse me. I really must he going.
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
 It's just not.
Why not, you stupid bastard?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
No, you...didn't?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
 I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.
He is totally harmless you geek. Was totally harmless. Just like you are totally harmless. But he did do all that shit and you have failed lo get us into I 50, so, you know, what can I say?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Do you want another Perrier Timothy? Some seltzer water?
Oh brother look-he presents himself as a harmless Old codger. But inside...
But inside...
But inside doesn't matter...
 Inside? Yes, inside? Believe it or not, Price we're actually listening to you.
Bateman? Come on, what do you think?
Whatever.
Whose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers? I need a Scotch.
There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it, I have now surpassed...
My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no escape.
But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis. I gain no deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this. This confession has meant nothing...
