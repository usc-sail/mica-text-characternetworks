Airight so this is the world and there are five billion people on it.  When I was a kid there were three.  It's hard to keep up.
That's better.  That's america. See, America still sets the tone for the world...
In Indiana -- Clark Hodd.  13. The best point guard in the country. Puberty hasn't been easy.
 Becky Farling.  You'll see her in the next Olympics.
Seattle, Washington.  Dallas Malloy. Went to court to be allowed to box professionally. She's 16.
Art Stallings, Indio, California. Check out what pure joy looks like.
In Odessa, Texas, the great Frank Cushman.  Cush is 20. Quarterback, role model, my client. He'll probably go number one in the draft this year.
There's genius everywhere, but until they turn pro, it's like popcorn in the pan. Some pop...
 ...  some don't.
Now I'm the guy you don't usually see. I'm the one behind the scenes.  I'm the sports agent.
Easy now, we can spread these numbers over five years...
You know those photos where the new player holds up the team jersey and poses with the owner?
 That's me on the left.
Inside that building, that's where I work.  Sports Management International.
Thirty-three out of shape agents guiding the careers of 2,120 of the most finely-tuned athletes alive...
 ... in this economy, sometimes emotions run a little high.
Was the girl 16 or seventeen?
Were you aiming at anyone when you fired the shot in the 7/l1?
Listen, there's no proof of anything except that this guy is a sensational athlete.
Are you Calvin Nack?  Could you sign my card?
I'm sorry little fella.  I can't sign that particular brand of card.  I can only sign Pro-Jam Blue Dot cards.
Lately, it's gotten worse.
Do you know your name?
I uh... wait.  Wait, here it comes. I have it.  My name is Steve Remo. I play for the Blackhawks.  You are my son.  This pretty lady is my wife.  And you are...
 My agent!
Yes!
And I gotta play this weekend, Doc. If I play in 65% of the games, I make my bonus.
This is his fourth concussion. Shouldn't somebody get him to stop?
 Come on -- it'd take a tank to stop your dad.  It would take all five Super Trooper VR Warriors, right?
Fuck you.
Two nights later in Miami at our corporate conference, a breakthrough. Breakdown? Breakthrough.
 It was the oddest, most unexpected thing.  I began writing what they call a Mission Statement for my company. You know -- a Mission Statement -- a suggestion for the future.
What started out as one page became twenty-five. Suddenly I was my father's son.  I was remembering the simple pleasures of this job, how I ended up here out of law school, the way a stadium sounds when one of my players performs well on the field... I was remembering even the words of the late Dicky Fox, the original sports agent, who said:
The key to this job is personal relationships.
And suddenly it was all pretty clear. The answer was fewer clients.  Caring for them, caring for ourselves, and the games too. Starting our lives, really.
 Hey, I'll be the first to admit it. What I was writing was somewhat "touchy feely."
 I didn't care.  I had lost the ability to bullshit.  It was the me I'd always wanted to be.
I printed it up in the middle of the night, before I could re-think it.
That's how you become great, man. You hang your ba11s out there.
 Thanks.
Hi, it's jerry maguire.  Uh, listen did those manuscripts get... Oh they did... No no no no no, that's fine...
Jerry in suit, alone with his luggage.  Dry throat. clammy, holds onto the handrail to steady himself.
I was 35.  I had started my life.
Monkeyface... monkeyface, listen... I'm not going to say it here.... no...
 ...  oh listen, I got you the perfect white shirt, at this out of the way place... no... quit trying to make me say it!
 how about if I do it and don't say it... mmmm... see you soon...
I have to ask.
 What --
Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
Look, my son is allergic to the material in these blankets -
That's all we have.
 I'm sorry I was rude just then --
It's okay.  We're in it together now...
Don't take anything I say seriously! I love to flirt!
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Well.  Good luck with that --
Can I just get a quick "man's" opinion from you on something?
And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now...
Tell me how you proposed.  I collect romantic proposal stories.
No no...
 Oh, tell the story.
Oh, tell the story.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
Gorgeous.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
To the pools?
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
Oh no --
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
How sad --
But wait...
 Mama --
Shhh.  Mommy's eavesdropping.
Now little do I know that my assistant. has assumed that I've now proposed. So she has gotten the lounge band to actually play "Here Comes The Bride" when we walk back in.
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
What's wrong, mom?
First class is what's wrong.  It used to be a better meal.  Now it's a better life.
 You'll know when you see him. You'll know when you see him.
Oh my God, you're right.  I know.  He's not The One.  He's not the One.
Ray! Ray!
Can I help?
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
 Hmm.  Pretty good.
Now what did you lose?
My son... my mind...
Well, while I go look for him, why don't you hang onto this curious gentleman behind you --
Remember "imagination?"... remember what that means?  Well, this is one of my bosses so you will now IMAGINE me screaming at you right now. Do NOT do that again.  Ever ever EVER.
 Well, thanks.
Well, take care.
And have fun at your bachelor party.
 Oh no.
No no. I knew.
 Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.
I loved your memo, by the way.
Thanks... actually, it was just a "Mission Statement."
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
 You think so?
Oh tsht. Yes.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
 -- "and we should all force open the tightly-clenched fist of commerce, and give a little back for the greater good.". I mean, I was inspired, and I'm an accountant.  Ray, don't spill my coffee.
One-two-three... swing.
Hey.  To respect yourself enough to say it out loud, to put yourself out there, so openly...  ... I don't know, it got me.
One-two-three, swing.
Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
 Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
One-two...
... three, swing.
Come on, I'm double-parked.
 Hmmph.  Whoever snagged him must be some classy babe --
Don't ever stop fucking me!
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
 Never BETTER!!
 Open your eyes.  If you ever want me to be with another woman for you, I would do it.  I'm not interested in it. There was a time, yes, it felt normal for me, but it was a phase, a college thing, like torn Levi's or law school for you... people change, but if you ever feel like being adventurous in that way, I would do it for you.  You want anything from the kitchen I'm going to get some fruit --
 You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
 Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
I know about the bachelor party.
Who told you?
One of the accountants.
Jerry.  Your buddy Dooler worked his ass off to make you a tribute film. All those guys from the office are coming.  Everybody loves you.  Just calm down, relax, act surprised, and have an amazing time.  And you'll never guess who narrates your bachelor movie.
I have often wondered where my career would have been had Jerry Maguire been my agent.  The answer -- Yugoslavia.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
Oh come on --
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
 You're imagining it.
We still having lunch tomorrow, Jerry?  Looks like Carl Denton tested positive for marijuana. That moves Cush solidly up to numero uno in the draft.
Oh, that'll really help this party! Let's all talk business!
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
 The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
Sorry I yelled.  You have exquisite taste.
Everybody's having a great time. You're both nuts -- the movie's great.
I like that guy.
 ... this is... uh... too funny...
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
 Marcee's here.  She's already in your office.
Thanks, Wendy.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
Tyson, hello.
 How can I make your life better?
I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition. 
He is the biggest, fastest, raddest wide-receiver in the league.  Now I don't know what you do for your four-percent
Cronin's okay for lunch?
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
Pleasure.
You've called our house, right?
Sorry to interrupt you guys.
Now I don't know what you do for your five-percent, but this man, my husband has a whole plan, an image... we majored in marketing, Jerry, and when you put him in a Waterbed Warehouse commercial, excuse me, you are making him common.  He is pure gold and you're giving him "Waterbed Warehouse" when he deserves the big four -- shoe, car, clothing- line, soft-drink.  The four jewels of the celebrity endorsement dollar.
 You gonna get that --
Not a chance.
 Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
 Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
 Damn right.
Look at that handsome man, trying to build a life up there by the air-conditioner. We're coming to get ya, darlin!  We are so close to having it all!
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
You okay?
 I'm fine.  What's up?
I came here to let you go.
Pardon me?
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
 It's real, Jerry.  You... you should say something.
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
You...
 You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
 -- although I do gotta hand it to you.  For about five minutes you had everyone applauding smaller revenues.
You... ungrateful... unctuous...
 ... dick?
Dick.
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
You'll lose.
 You wanted smaller.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Jerry --
-- and I'll get 'em.
 You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
Cush.  Hey Dudeboy!  It's Bob Sugar. Listen, I'm callin' ya first 'cause you're the most important guy in sports...
Carla, right now you're paying 25% of your endorsments to SMI, I would cut my commission by 7%...
You read that memo I snuck to you, the guy's tired of the job.  Tired of making you money.
And when I got you that big contract in Chicago, and the fan poll in the Sun-Times was 93% against you, who went and found you that sympathetic journalist who turned it all around, it was me...
He's costing you money, Debra... he's oldschool.
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
What's going on?
 They fired Jerry Maguire.  Did it at Cronin's.
-- personal attention --
-- more money, more endorsements --
-- a family of athletes --
-- the millenium, eight-hundred channels more endorsements. Think of me, think of dollars.
Kathy!  Hi, it's Jerry Maguire.
I already heard from Bob Sugar. Jerry I want to cry for what they did to you at SMI.  You helped me win that gold at the Olympics, we have history, and... oh Jerry... if we weren't in the middle of the Accura deal, you know I'd go with you!  Oh Jerry, oh God...
 ...  Call Waiting... who could be calling me now?...
 Hiyee.
Still me, Kathy.
Ohhhhhhhh...
It's not show "friends". It's show business.
Rod! How ya doing? Jerry Maguire.
"How am I doing?"  I'll tell you. I'm sweatin, dude!  That's how I'm "doin." I'm sweatin my contract. I'm sweatin' Bob Sugar calling and telling me I'm blowing the big endorsements if I stay with you. I'm sweatin'. You hear what I'm saying?
I hear what you're saying...
No.  I hear that you hear what I'm saying.  But do you hear what I'm saying?
I'll bet he hasn't even called you yet, right Jennifer? Wait, I need to cough...
 Hi, Ben, it's Sugar, hold on a second, have you heard from Maguire? You haven't????  Well, that tells you a lot.  Hold on, gotta cough...
 So Jennifer...
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
 Okay.
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
Now you want Arizona dollars.
Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire --
Hello Jerry Maguire.
--  the house is fallin' apart, we don't even know where we're gonna live in a year, and I'm supposed to be a "superstar," man!  Are you catching my flow, here?
I need a decision from you, Rod.
Killer, Steve, good decision.  So it's yes, right?  Excellente.  Tell me it's yes... yes?  YES!
--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
 Mmm.  Hmm.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
Yes.
Here it is.  "Show me the money."  Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
I got it.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
An African-American man running with a little ball, working for white owners and white agents. It's the iconography of rascism... (off Tidwell's dismissive look) ... but I woulda stayed at the bigger company.
Well, don't worry!  I'm not going to do what you think I'm going to do, which is FLIP OUT!
EMPTY_LINE
 But let me just say, as I ease out of the office I helped build -- sorry, but it's a fact --
-- that there is such a thing as manners.  A way of treating people...
 These fish have manners!  They have manners.
 In fact.  They're coming with me! I'm starting a new company, and the fish will come with me and... you can call me sentimental.
 it's okay... it's okay...
 But if anybody else wants to come with me, this moment will be the ground floor of something real and fun and inspiring and true in this godforsaken business and we will do it together!  Who's coming with me besides... "Flipper" here?
 Anybody going with me?
 Wendy?  Shall we?
I'm three months away from the pay increase, Jerry.  I have to, uh... you know, stay.
Okay, anybody else?
I'll go with you. (quietly, on her coffee mess) Wonderful...
Dorothy Boyd!  Thank you!
 We will see you all again.  Sleep tight!
 Let's see how they do without us.
Wonder what he said.
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me."
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
No no, I know --
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
 Absolutely.
And when you think about what you've done later, don't panic.
Me?  No.  My sister -- it's a good bet.
 That took guts.
Same to you.
I love men.  I respect men.  But that doesn't change the fact that most of them belong in cages...
What about medical?
Of course, medical!
 You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
 If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
 You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
 Of course I know --
A hundred and fifty dollars.
And that's just when he's well --
Wait. Where is he?
He's in the living room asleep.
Wonderful.  Next time you lecture me, don't leave my little boy in a room with your Divorced Women's Group...
Sorry.
Okay I've finally, finally, gotten my anger straight here.  I'm going to visualize Carl being here and finally tell him --
Shhhh!
 Come on, buddy, we're going to bed.
 What did I do?
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
 And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
 "Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Ugh!
 Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.  Jacket on, tie in pocket.
 Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
That's right.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Okay, this is working.
You are not a loser.
Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?"
I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
Now.
Let's go.  I'll drive you.
 What if I don't get him?
Function function function. Forward motion is everything. Cush saves all.
No sports agents allowed!  Ha ha.
I'm in the back den, Jerry.
You like a Bloody Beer, Jerry? Beer and tomato juice --
No thanks.
 Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --
 We decided to stay with you.
Oh, thank you.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
Hey, Jerry, what's been going on?
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
 Hell, I'll either surf or ski. I don't care.
Denver is where he should be.
I'll give it everything.
You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak.
 Feelin...
Dorothy? Jerry Maguire!  Is Avery there? Where can I reach her?
Uh, she had to fly to Atlanta, didn't leave me her hotel number.
The new playhouse rocks, Dotty.
 Yeah!
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
Hello?
 Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
 ... light.
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
Wait a minute, it has to be one of the NFL hotels we do business with -- let me look -- but in the meantime, about this job --
 Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
We are?
It's all going to work.
I just got goosebumps.
 It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Happy for us.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Thanks.
Call me later, hon.
 Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
 Yeah, Dotty. You did.
Twenty six years old.  I'm already saying "hon". Hug your mother quickly --
Avery, I signed Cush.  Again.
YA-HOOOO-SIE!
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Well, no you didn't --
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
It's a plan --  --
I'll set it up with your girl. Woo!  This is when it's good, Jerry. Enjoy it. Live it.  Love it.  And when I see you, I'm going to give you the best blow job of your life.
Avery'll meet you at the B gate at 4:15.  Don't be late. Tidwell will already be there.
 Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
No.
They do, my brother.
 I'm not your brother!
... I put Tidwell on the same floor at the Marriott Marquis.  I think it's great you're taking him to the draft. He doesn't smoke, right? I have no idea.
I have no idea.  So Ray, if there's an accident or something, it goes pwoooooooof --  -- and you go booooong.  And you're safe.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Luck.                         LUCK!
Are you Hootie?
 No man, I'm not Hootie.
All those disabled, and Frank Cushman can board now...
 Jerry.  Why does God sometimes reward the evil and punish the good?
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
 I see what you're saying.
Wait.  What do you mean?
Hey man, I wish I had a quarterback like you in Arizona. You're the shit.
Thank ya.
 Well you ain't that mothafuckin good.
Say what?
I said -- last I heard, Jesus Christ was still in heaven.  And you ain't even played in the NFL.
This can't be happening to me.
Jerry!  Do something --
HEY.  Knock it off.  What are you, five years old?  Am I taking the kids to Chuck E. Cheese here? Grow up, both of you!  We are a family. And we go to the draft in an ORDERLY FASHION.
Hey, man, I dig Check E. Cheese.
Me too, dude.  Especially that big old singin' Elvis Monkey.  That's just insanity, man.
Heard that.
At last I find you.
 Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
Come on.  Come with me.  We're going to take a walk through this lobby. I want every media guy, every player rep, everybody to see you for what you are.  The best- kept secret in the NFL. The biggest wide-receiver in the game. Let 'em see ya, Rod.  And Whatever you do, don't sit down. Let 'em see how big you are.  You ready? Let's do it.
 A'right.  Let's walk.
Dennis, try not to laugh.  Jerry Maguire brought Rod Tidwell to the draft...
Good, I hope he unloads him so I can buy a decent quarterback. Who's he talking to?
Right now, Dallas.  Ha ha.
They don't look interested do they?
Actually...
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Let's do it again.
 You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me...
You know what was great about you down there?  For about five minutes, you unloaded that rather expansive, let me just say "large" chip that resides right there on your shoulder, and you know what? You were brilliant.  Take care.
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
 I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
Call me tomorrow.
I might call you later!
 Hey, what size are you?
Eleven.
 Why don't you grab a couple pairs of them new Nikes by the door --
Dude, you're like a God.
 God, you're like a dude.
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
Well, he's gotta go number one.
"Ooooooo."
He still goes number one, but San Diego wants to trade up with New England -- they want him bad.
What happened to Denver?
Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
I don't know, Jerry.
Should I unplug the phone?
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.
"This is Cush."
It's Sugar.  He must be there, right? Just sniff or something if he's there. (Jerry sniffs, panicked) Alright, buddydude.  Just remember. You're swimming with the big boys now. You let your dad do all the talking.  I'm the one who got you the deal you needed.  This is business not friendship. Be strong.  You're global now.
"No comment.
Hey, it's Cush on the big t.v. again!
Hell, I'm already sick of me. I got "Cushlash."
Look, before I go back to Denver. I think we should put something down on paper.  Something that says, "hey, I'm with Jerry Maguire."
Not right now, Jerry.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
 Said who?  Sugar?
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
I'm sorry, I --
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
 It's okay.  You want Denver. I'll fix this up.  You didn't sign anything with Sugar, right?
 Mr. Maguire, someday I'm gonna be a famous athlete and I'm gonna sign with you'.
Shut up!  I'm sorry... sorry.
 S' cool.
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
I'm sorry, Jerry.
They say it's show "business," Jerry, not show friends.
Well. Okay. Of course. You're twenty years old, and I'm just another guy in a suit.  It's all business. It didn't work out.  You didn't buy my product, which is, unfortunately, mm. Let me see, there's a speech that I'm supposed to make -- right! -- "I'll be out there cheering for you." "The door is always open!"  See? I'm a class act.  But maybe this would have all worked, us being real human beings, coming through for each other, really, and now I'll never know. You'll never know. Weren't you curious?  No.  Okay, well, I'll be fine. And you'll be fine.  And Keith I bope you do call me.
Jerry, is it true that Tidwell's had three concussions?
I'm sorry... excuse me...
I just heard.
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Oh honey.  It's spun.
What did I do to you?
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Could you just stop moving?
I have to finish my job --
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
Look, I don't want a --
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm.
So honesty is outlawed here, I can't be honest?
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
I think you added the "brutal."
Jerry, there is a "sensitivity" thing that some people have.  I don't have it.  I don't cry at movies.  I don't gush over babies. I don't start celebrating Christmas five months early, and I don't tell a man who just screwed up both of our lives -- 'oh, poor baby.'  That's me.  For better or worse.  But I do love you.
Avery --
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
-- stop --
Hey!  Curtis Weintraub from the Sports Popper!  Haven't seen you two since the Cuervo Gold Rock 'n Sock Charity Six Flags Budfest! Hello!
 Goodbye!
I'm warning you.  Don't say it. You won't have another chance.
Listen to me!
No.
It's over --
Didn't hear it.
There is something missing here.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Listen to me, it's over.
No one has ever dumped me.
I'm not trying to make history.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
 No.
Oh Jerry.
 You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
I won't let you hurt me, Jerry. I'm too strong for you.  Loser.
You love me now, don't you?
Very much.
Everybody on this show cries now.
Rod --
 You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
Huh?
Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!
 See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
 No.
It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime.
You are not allowed to act this way.
Why not?
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
 Another drink please.
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
 Oh my God.
He's coming over.
At eleven at night?
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
Okay, but he better not be good looking!
'Night buddy.  This is my favorite part of your head.
Okay, turn here!  Sharp right turn. 8831 3/4 Waterloo.
 Yes, good, floor it, kill us!!
I'm Jerry Maguire.
 You seem just the way I pictured you. I'm her disapproving sister Laurel.
Honesty.  Thank you.
Hey you.
Hi.
 Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
Oh my God.
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
Too bad.
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Do you have something to drink?
Sure --
My brother works for the White House. He pretends he's an intellectual.  He pretends he's from the east coast.
 I was supposed to be the successful one. 
But I don't want to talk about it. And yet!  My family.  I grew up with repression as a... a religion --you don't bitch.  No moaning!  Head down.  Do it, whatever "it" may be. My dad... he worked for the United Way for 38 years!  You know what he said when he retired? He said, "I wish I'd had a more comfortable chair." 38 years he sat in it!  Do you know what I'm saying, Dorothy? Repression as a religion. I'm almost as old as his chair.
Beer okay?
Yeah, thanks.
I heard.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
 Thank you.
Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up --
That's the girl I love.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
As opposed to twenty angry women?
Come on, let's get you another top --
Hi.
Hi Ray.
All I'm saying.  You don't have the luxury of falling for some drowning man.  Be practical.  Now. Which top?
Okay, you want to talk about practical? Let's talk about my wonderful life. Do you know what most other women my age are doing right now? They are partying in clubs, trying to act stupid, trying to get a man, trying to keep a man... not me. I'm trying to RAISE a man.
 I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
Good.
Thanks.
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Let's go the zoo.
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right. 
All my life I've been trying to talk, really talk, and no one wants to listen.  You know that feeling?
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
You said "fuck".
Yeah I know.  I did.
I won't tell.
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
I don't see any.
 Funny.
Funny...  (hears mom approaching) I better go to bed.
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
 Good idea.  Thank you.
 Right.  Of course.
So.  Our company.
Okay.  Lil' speech before I go.
 Do.  Not.  Worry.  About.  Your. Job.  Our company is in good shape. You and your son... we... are just fine.  You still have a job. I want you to feel confident!  In. Me.  And I have a problem with people who talk about themselves in the third person, but let me tell you something about Jerry Maguire.
 Come after me and you will lose I am a survivor!  Do not underestimate Jerry Maguire!  I've got wits! 
I've got the instincts of a panther!  I've got Dorothy Boyd on my side!
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
We will be fine!
-- especially one like this.
And I am...
 I am drunk.
Truth?
Sure.
Sure, I care about the job.  Of course.  But mostly...  ...  I want to be inspired.
Me too.
What you wrote inspired me.
 I'm working with you because of that memo...
Mission... statement...
Well.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Don't worry about it, boss.
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Yeah, I did.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
I may not sue.
Well, good evening.
Good evening.
We'll be okay.  And I'm going to take my... one client and we're gonna go all the way.
 Hey. I'm back.
We gotta talk about his contract, Dennis.
Your timing is impeccable, Maguire. Gee, I can't imagine how you ever lost Cush...
I started talking with Dennis Wilburn about your renegotation.
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
Uh, not today, but --
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
I understand your anxiety.
Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the "coin."  It's the...
 --  the kwan.
That's your word?
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
 But how did you get "kwan?"
 I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
Great word.  Towel?
No, I air-dry.
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
Is that your porty or mine?
You.
Hi baby. Yeah, I'm just breakin' in the new agent.  He says I'm not marquee.  I know... I know...
 My wife is upset with you.
Here's what I'm saying.  This is a renegotiation.  We want more from them, so let's show them more from us. Let's show them your pure joy of the game, let's bury the Attitude a little, let's show them --
 You're telling me to dance.
No, I'm saying to be --
 "Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
Fine.
I'm an athlete, not an entertainer. These are the ABC's of ME.  Get it? I don't dance.
 What's wrong.
Forget it.  Forget it.
No tell me.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
 Hey.  I'm happy to entertain you! I'll see you in L.A.!
See, man, that's the difference. between us.  You think we're fighting, I think we're finally talking!
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
 Happy. He said "happy?"
Actually he said "glad."
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
Plus, you could use that commission.
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
You don't have to explain.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
 Yeah, what happened there.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
I'm relieved you said that.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
 Oh good.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts. 
Think about everything that's gone wrong, how to fix them, and just be... alone, alone, alone.
You want to go out to dinner?
I broke up with the Cowboy. And now he's stalking me...
What's the current definition of stalking?
 So Romeo under the trellis... was a stalker.
Hey, looks like you've got a fan.
 Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...
Don't let him stay up too late.
 Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
You know, you people have a jazz problem in this house.
I wanna go too.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Bye you guys.
Hey!
 Forgot your keys --
 That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
 Oh, knock it off!
 And don't be a shoulder for him to cry on either.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
A song for the lovers?
 No.  No thanks.
We work together.
See, you choose. If you fall for someone, if you make a commitment, you should make it work.  It's only when "options" entered the picture that things got bad. I'm speaking historically now.  It's a modern day concept, nueroticism -- how do I feeeeeel? -- I think the only good thing to 
come from this period in history is probably the movie "Annie Hall."
 Maybe you should call her.
No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?
A rose for the lady.
You want a --
 No.  No way.
 Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
What?
 Let's not tell our sad stories.
 I'll be right back. Quit thinking those murky thoughts, okay? We're young, we're semi-successful. Life is good.
No, now... come on... let Chad catch the bee in a glass.  He won't hurt it. Aw, buddy, you got such a good heart. I love you, I'll be home soon.  Can't wait to see you.
Come on, let's take a walk.
Well -- this would be goodnight.
Good night.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Good night.
 I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Same to you.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Right.  I'll come in.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
 Oh hell yes.
He's asleep, right?
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Still going.
 Shhh.
Treat her right, man.  She's...
 Yeah... well...
She's great.  And I know this is a little awkward, but I want you to use this.
 This... is Miles Davis and John Coltrane. Stockholm.  1963... two masters of freedom, playing in a time before their art was corrupted by a zillion cocktail lounge performers who destroyed the legacy of the only American artform -- JAZZ.
What is this MUSIC?
I'm getting him up, don't worry.' Ray will never see his mother's raging physical needs.
First you gotta tell me something.
No--
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
Please, if I start talking --
Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
... so what am I, for taking the opportunity, Laurel? 
Maybe I am taking advantage.  Am I a bad person? All I know is that I found someone who was charming and popular and not-so-nice to me -- and he died.  Okay?  So why should I let this guy go, when everything in my body says This One is The One.
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
Hi Jerry!
Oh God.
Easy, easy --
 I could pretend I didn't hear, but I won't, I heard everything.  Thank you for your honesty, as always.
 Coffee, Jerry?
Oh, no thanks.  We bottom-feeders prefer cereal first --
Let's have Apple Jacks!
 What's going on, Jerry?
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
That was great of you this morning.
 Look, let's just root for a big offer so we can move out of this room to a real office.
Read it to me, and don't say anything unless it's over nine.
Aw shit --
One-point-seven for three years. That's below average.  We owe more than that...
I'll go back to them.
 And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
 I'm sorry.  I'm a little pregnant right now.
I feel like crying.  I feel like breaking the room up.
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man.
Marcee --
What DO you stand for???
How about a little piece of integrity in this world that is so filled with greed and a lack of honorability that I don't know what to tell my kid except take a look at a guy who isn't shouting "show me the money," he's quietly broke and working for you for free! (off Jerry's pained look) Well, I'm sorry, I'm not as good at the insults as she is.
No, that was pretty good.
 No shit.
In fact, you should read something that meant the world to me...
Another time, okay Dorothy?
Fine, I just --
And I appreciate that impulse.
Tell me what to do, Jerry.  You tell me to eat lima beans, I'll eat lima beans. 
If you say take the shitty deal, that's all we can get --
"All we can get?"
Can I SPEAK with my agent here?
You know what you're qonna do, Rodney. You're gonna reject this shitty contract. You're gonna play out your existihg shitty contract and go be a free agent next year and the hell with Arizona. This is us, and we determine our worth. You're a fine, proud, surviving, splendid black man.
Honey, you are just --
 -- the shit.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
It's a risk.
Bet on me, dude.  Bet on me like I bet on you.
I'll get you some quick work --
Good deal, man.
I'm sorry what I said back there.
Don't be silly.
My husband believes in you.  We're gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
Take care you guys.
 Look...  I was up for a job in San Diego before I left SMI. It's with the Chargers.
Don't even talk about that yet. I'll find something fast for Tidwell. We'll stay afloat.
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
Bill, Rod, wait --
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
Rod, get on the camel.
 The sponsor wants a camel --
Jerry, back me up.  It's either the camel or me...
 Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
There you go, dude.  You're learning how to represent me.  We ain't gonna bring Nike to their knees with some regional camel ad --
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
What do you know about dating a single mother?
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
How do I know?
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
No, I don't know.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man.
The kid is amazing.
 No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
They offered me everything I asked for, it's only 2 hours away. I think it's good for us.
Show me the animal, Jerry!
Right up ahead, buddy --
 -- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
I'm scared.  What is it?
It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of...
 The Two-Headed Corn Snake.
Whoa.
 Two heads.  My God...
Both heads have brains.  Both heads eat, both heads battle for direction all day long.  Man, can I relate.
Me too.
Is this a guy thing?
It is, and it isn't.
You're doing the right thing. I mean, come on.  You need to start your life and he... he needs a warm body to cushion the fall. Check out exhibit A on the front lawn --
I'm not good at this.
 I'll see you this weekend, okay? Promise.
 Sure you're okay to drive this?
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
So I'll see you this weekend.
Airight, so goodbye and --  I love you.
 ... I love you too, you know.
 What --
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
Wait a second.
WAIT A SECOND!
 I know a way to s... to save on Medical and rent and... look...
 ...  what if we stayed together? What if we uh... got married.
 If I said that, would you stay?
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Will you marry me?
Where are all your friends?
 In the band.
Wow.  We actually --
Yeah, we did.
If you fuck this up, I'll kill you.
 Glad we had this talk!
You never had The Talk, did you?
No.
Well, this was another way to go.
 This is my agent, man!  And we're all gonna have a great season!
 That's my motherfucker!
Why don't you be the first man in your family not to say that word? And then we'll let you live.
 Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
 That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
How's your head? Bubblicious.
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
I'm a little worried --
I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
 FUCKIN ROD TIDWELL YOU RULE YOU RULE!  I WON A FUCKIN, A FUCKIN MUG ON YOU IN MY ROTISS... ROTLISS...
Peace, my drunken brother.  Ahd don't discuss gambling with me.
We can still take the offer, Rod.
 No.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
 Hey, that's my word, okay?
I'll see you in Arizona.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
You don't want to go home, do you?
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
I'm asking you a question --
No, you're --
I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
Not everyone has what you have.
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
 You're jabbing at me.
I'm sorry I asked.
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
That's an answer.
Damn right.
 For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Why not --
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
 I think so.
 Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field -- 
 -- you're a businessman.  It's wide-angle lenses and who fucked you over and who owes you for it. That's not what inspires people. I'm sorry, but that's the truth, can you handle it? Just a "question," Rod.  Between friends.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
Fine.
Beautiful.
 We still having dinner in L.A.?
 Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
 "No heart."  "No heart?"  I'm all heart, motherfucker!
-- so I go to see a so-called "black" film the other day --  -- honey, no more salt for you, I don't want you dehydrated for Monday Night Football.  Most important game of your career. 
 -- TWENTY minutes of coming attractions. All black films, all violent, I'm talking about brothers shooting brothers, Wesley Snipes with guns the size of our house, killing, blood flowing, cars crashing... blood blood blood blood. Is this all they think we want to see? Come on!  I enjoyed Shindler's List.  Give me a little credit, I mean hooo --
I hate you going to movies alone withoutme --
Oh baby --
What baby?
Baby.  Baby.  Baby...
What were you thinking tonight? Watching them go through the complete human emotional experience?
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
 And I really don't know your noises yet.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
 Okay... I will...
Why do you love me?
Why do you love me?
Jerry, can I come in and watch t.v.?
I'll come visit you in a      Just for a few minutes, second --                     buddy --
Tonight.  Yeah, the red-eye, I'll be in Arizona on Monday...
It's my fault.
What --
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
 Tell me -- let me help --
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
 Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
I don't need you to "stick."
You want...
I don't know --
 ...my soul or something.
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
 Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
I think we made a mistake here.
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
 I don't like to give up.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
What about Ray?
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
So this break... is a break-up.
Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me. 
I mean, on the surface, you'd almost think everything was fine. See, I've got this great guy who loves my kid --  -- and he sure does like me a lot.
 I can't live that way.  It's not the way I'm "built."
Don't wake up...
 ...  it was just a Mission Statement...
He'd better not mess up on Monday Night Football.
 What did I say?  He gets nervous for the t.v. games... it's not a secret.
Nothing like Monday Night, huh? What is it, 2 billion viewers?
 Shouldn't you be out there doing some pickle dance or something -- Pickle Man nods and goes out to dance for the crowd.
Hey Rod -- hey Buddydude --
Listen, I spoke to your quarterback. He's my client, you know.  And I said, "take care to get those passes down, let Tidwell look good on t.v."
 You should let me do more for you. I would have had you your deal by tonight.  Al Michaels is a friend of mine. I would have had him on the air, talking about you, tonight, when it counts.
Get outta here.  Go.
Where's your agent tonight?
Don't know.
Rod.  I know this is "uncool" to do this now, but you belong with the big boys.  You belong with the money. You belong with --
Get the fuck away from my guy, Sugar.
Jerry!  You made it --
 Go.  Flee.
Thanks for coming.
 I missed ya.  What can I say?
It's a bruiser out there tonight.
Arizona refusing to go into the quiet night of this rough football season. Come on, I'm trying to be poetic here.
Ooof.  Another rough hit across the middle on Rod Tidwell. Nothing poetic about that.
What does daddy say?
"It looks worse than it is...
They don't pay enough for a man to take that kind of ugly hit --
 Boy, no s-h-i-t.
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
Can you be quiet?
What'd I say?
--   you sure hope his family wasn't watching that.
He should have kept his head tucked down.
 Shut up!!!
I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
Can't you be loyal to your brother who LOVES you??  Get out of my house!
It's Jerry Maguire!
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back.
My whole life is this family, Jerry. It doesn't work without him.
DON'T TOUCH HIM!!!
Let's get you off the field!
Wait.
Can you feel your legs?
Yeah.  Just let me enjoy this for a minute.
 You ain't talking now, are you??? You're a silent motherfucker!
 Nike.
I always knew he was great.
It's Tidwell!
We did it.
Hello.  It's Marcee.  She says she couldn't get through on your phone.
Why don't we have that kind of relationship?
One love... you got to share it...
Jerry Maguire.  I'm Tommy Bendis. You don't know me, I'm a new agent, just getting started.  I represent that place kicker over there.  I wondered if you would sign this for me. Because it inspired me.
Just make it out "To Tommy".
Tommy.  I love you.
I've listened to you all tell a thousand sob stories, and I have been very judgmental. Frankly, I think you've all been waaaay too comfortable with your pain.  Plus, Jan, you always spill your red wine on the couch. (off Jan's guilty look) I've not been fair to you.  Women need to stick together, and not depend on the affections of a man to "fix" their lives.  Maybe you're all correct. Men are the enemy.
 But I still love the enemy.
Hello.  I'm looking for my wife.
 Alright.  If this is where it has to happen, then this is where it has to happen.
 I'm not letting you get rid of me. How about that?
 This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello.
 I think we'd better go...
...your father who left the family on Christmas eve, the mother who cleaned the steps of a prison to make your tuition. The older brother who lost a leg in that tragic bass fishing accident --
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
 It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
Wanna send some beautiful love out to my offensive line, just a beautiful bunch of dudes, wanna thank a beautiful individual -- God, and of course the entire Arizona organization, a little slow, but they do come around. I'm leaving somebody out...
Take care, Marcee.  We'll see you at the restaurant.
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
Ten seconds, Rod.
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
 Wait!  And thank you Melvin from the Casual Man, thank you for the suit...
Come on, Ray.                 Ray, let's go.
