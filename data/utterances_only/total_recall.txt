towards the eyes, which appear to be red gems.
 Tick, tock, seven o'clock.  Time to rise and open your eyes.
 Tick, tock, seven-oh-one.  Time to get up, the day had begun.
 Tick, tock --
I dreamed about Mars again... it was bizarre, yet is was so real...
 It's your time of the month again.
 At least once a month.  Douglas Quail's obsession.  For twelve years you've been talking about Mars.
People do go to Mars, you know.
That's right, Douglas.  But not you.  Not us.
 As it is, we can barely scrape by on your lousy ten thousand a week.
 What do they expect ... the way men dress these days ... then they scream rape.
You know -- let's really do it.
Rape men in the park?
No.  Go to Mars.
 Go to hell.
We can pool our savings and I've got some sick leave coming, besides my regular vacation...
 ...more of a half-wit.  For a start a war could break out there any day ...
That's just media talk.  They're... (indicating the protesters) ...just a minority.  They're powerless.
Well, there's a lot of things we need around here before we waste our money on a trip to Mars.  We're broke.  I'm just a slave around this dump. Now if you were capable of finding a better job....
It's now eight.  You'll be late!
I'll be late!
No weapon again, Mr. Quail?
I keep forgetting, Herb.  They frighten me.
Yeah?  Well, it's the law, Mr. Quail.  Has been since 1990 they tell me.  Tomorrow - ya carry ya gun or ya get reported.
Okay.  Herb, okay.
-- more violence today from Mars's strike-torn ore colonies --
 ...but Earth Intelligence Operations Director Vilos Cohaagen, clearly worried about the damage to Mars's all important tourist industry was today dismissive of the dissident groups....
We're dealing with a bunch of extremists and unrepresentative lunatics.  Mars is a happy and prosperous protectorate of Earth... and will remain so.
There have been some criticisms, sir....
I have no further comment.
Good morning, commuters.  This portion of your trip is brought to you by Rekall, Inc.  Do you have a dream that never came true?  Do you aspire - but only perspire?  Has the great adventure passed you by?  Then come to... REKALL, where what might have been will have been. For the memories of a lifetime... REKALL.
We're all dreamers, Douglas. But here at Rekall, dreams are our business.
But... is the process really that effective?  A false memory!?
 We prefer the term "extra- factual implant".  Your memory will be complete in every way.  You will have gone to Mars.  We guarantee that.
Is it in any way dangerous? I mean, the medical techniques?
Not when you deal with qualified operators - like us.
It's just - incredible.
And look at our follow-up program!
 Space-flight ticket stub... passport... vaccination certificates... matchbooks from Martian Nouvelle Cuisine Restaurants, souvenirs, post cards... even names of people you met - now back there - who you can call and discuss your trip with... by the way, we plant these things where you'll come across them at random in the future.
But... I'll know I hired you. That'll destroy the whole illusion.
 But you won't remember me, or having been here.
I won't?
Your money back if you do! We've never paid out yet.
 And we have a special this month, for only two-hundred thousand dollars more.
 You can have a new identity for the duration of the trip. Pick one.
"Intelligence Agent"... wouldn't that be dangerous?  I might attack....
 No.  No.  You're a retired agent.  Mars was your last mission and you're never to break your cover.  But you'll have got the girl, killed the baddies, and saved the Universe.  Not bad, eh?
I don't know... about the whole thing... it's all such a fake.  I won't really have gone.  I won't really....
 Let's face it, Douglas, you, and millions of people like you have no chance of ever getting to Mars and you'd never qualify as a secret agent for EIO.  This - REKALL - is the only way to achieve your dream.
 Think about it, Douglas. Think, too, what a terrible boor a real holiday is. Lost tickets, endless arguments, lousy hotels, missed connections, rotten weather... Rekall will supply you with perfect, happy memories.
You know that's illegal.
Yeah?  Who's going to report me?  You?... wimp....
 Screwing around's illegal, too.  But just give me half a chance...
Hi, I'm Doctor Sophie Lull. Sorry I'm late. (walks toward coat closet) I'll be right with you.
 This really going to work?
It the Pope Martian?
 Okay -- that's it.
Now, just relax, kid.  This ain't gonna hurt.  Just a controlled drip of Narkadine. When you're under, I'll just ask ya a few questions, nothin' real personal, just full details of yer private life so's we can tailor the wish-fulfillment program to your needs.
 See?  Painless.  I didn't feel a thing.  Hey, you're a nice kid... you like a little somethin' extra?
 Good!  Kid -- have I got a girl for you!  She's gonna like you.  You're good-lookin'.  Gettin' sleepy?  Good.  Now, what's the first thing you think of when you're thinkin' about Mars?
 Well... I'd like to see the Martian Sphinx...
Okay -- you will, Dougle!  I want ya to start counting backwards from a hundred for me.
 One hundred... ninety-nine... ninety-eight... ninety-seven... ninety-six... ninety-five....
Okay, Ernie, the trip to Mars; number sixty-two... and throw in that blonde... We'll give him a real good time.
Sixty-two... and... the blonde...
Boy, is this one wild.  He won't want to come back.
Dougie?  This Sophie Lull. Can ya hear me?
...Sophie....
Good! ... I'm gonna ask ya a few more questions now.  Ya think you'll be able to answer 'em?
...Yes....
Attaboy!  To begin with, I wanna ask ya; -- You sex life.  How many orgasms a week?
Yes?
 Howie?  Listen, you'd better get in here.
 Not another schizoid embolism.
 You'd better get in here.
 Quail?  Dougie, can you hear me?
Yes.
Tell McClane what you told us.
 All of you in this room are dead.
 What's he talking about?
You've broken my cover.
What is this?...
The Narkadine cracked a memory cap.  Mars --  He's really been there.
Forced suppression?
With spontaneous breakthrough.
Holy shit.
 You've compromised the Sphinx Project.  You'll have to be silenced.
Wait a minute.  Quail --
My name isn't Quail.
Listen... whoever you are... sir.... (almost pleading) ...This is all an accident. We'll destroy all the records. No one will know.  I swear it. Believe me.
I believe you, but that won't stop E.T.O. from killing you.
 Killing you... killing you... killing you....
 He wants a false memory implanted -- of a trip he really took.  Someone at Earth Intelligence Operations erased his memory. All he know was going to Mars meant something special to him.
What do we do?  Graft a false memory pattern over the real memory of the same thing?
 Uh-uh... That could promote a partial breakthrough of the real trip.
 Revive him without any false memory implantation and get him out of here.
Why don't we just wipe out the memory of his visit here?
 Yes.  Good.  I'll destroy his file and cancel his fee. I have a feeling that the longer he doesn't know who he is, where he's been, where he's going and who we are, the better off we'll all be.  I'm taking a holiday. A real one.
Where am I?
Travelling south along Third Avenue, passing Fourty-third street.
Where am I going?
Thirty-three thirteen "G" Street, Sector "L", Twin Towers, Apartment six-thirty- five.
How did I get here?
I don not understand the question, sir or madam.
How did I get into this cab?
You stepped into it in the normal manner, sir or madam.
Aren't you the man from Mars?
Don't give us a reason to kill you.
Mr. Zimmer...Mr. Zimmer... help me... they're...
Where are you taking me?
You told everyone at Rekall about you trip to Mars. Where you went, who you worked for, what you did --
But I didn't... Are you telling me... I did go to Mars?  I don't remember?
You've remembered too much. The Sphinx Project, for a start....
 Sphinx?... No, no, I don't, I... What about the people at Rekall?  I don't recall Rekall but you said if they know what I did?  Why don't you ask them?  They'll tell you I didn't...
They've been taken care of.
What do you mean?
 What are you going to do with me?
Get in the car.
My God!  No!  You're going to kill me!
No one's going to kill you if [you do what you're told.] We're visiting E.I.O. for some new tests.  Now get in, or do we start playing rough?
No!  It's not my fault!  You can't do it!
 Wait a minute, I remember --
What, Quail?  What do you remember?
On Mars... they tried to kill me... And....
Did you know I've been to Mars?
What!  This stupid obsess...
 I think I've been.  I vaguely recall...
Doug, you've got to forget...
 Forget?  Remembering is the problem I must've been to one of those artificial memory places...
Oh my God...
But something went wrong... something about a real memory... and then those men...  tried to kill me.
What men?  Doug, you're crazy.
 You're here now.  They didn't kill you.
No.  That's what's so amazing. I killed them.  I think...
Where?  Where are they?
 Doug!  It's something they put into your mind at the memory place.  Fantasies. That's their business.
 You're a computer operator. You're a bore.  You're a wimp.  You're not a killer.
I'm involved somehow with E.I.O.  It's true.  It's no fantasy.
Doug, I want you to see a doctor.  Now Alec and Shirley Turnbull have a good man.  He helped Alec through his breakdown.
For fuck's sake, this is no breakdown!
My God!  Did you say I need a psychiatrist?
 I haven't seen you move that fast since I've known you.
 How could you do it?  After eight years!
I'm not your wife, Quail.
Not my wife!  You are out of your mind.
 It's a false memory implant. I never saw you before six weeks ago.
Why are you lying like this?
No, Quail.  It's true.  You work for E.I.O.  So do I.
 But why all of this?
 We had to watchdog you...make sure the erasure took.  A wife seemed like a good idea.
But I remember it!  All of it!... Us!
All implanted.
Our friends... my work... eight years.
The job's real -- you've had is six weeks -- since you got back from Mars.
 It's all a fabrication, Quail. Everything you know.
This is crazy!  If all my memories are false, who am I?  What am I?  Jesus... it's like I don't exist.
You exist, all right.  That's the problem.
Why did you try to kill me? Why does E.I.O. want me dead?
They don't particularly.  That was my idea.  This assignment was boring me to death.  The personality they gave you wasn't too thrilling.
Well, what did I do on Mars that they have to keep me from telling?
I've no idea.  I just work here.
All right... I'm leaving. Don't try and follow me --
I don't have to follow you. You can't get away from E.I.O. Nobody does.
No wonder you got the role as my bitchy wife -- type casting.
Fuck it!
We won't be able to track him again until he comes up above ground!
Coming in again.  Loud and clear.
 You are being fired on, sir or madam, please leave the cab at once.
[Please....]
 ...leave the cab as bullets are hitting the vehicle in considerable quantities.
This company, sir or madam, will institute legal action for damages...
 Help you, sir?
 A room for the night.
 ID.
 Here's ten thousand.  Forget the ID.
 I have a liaison with a lady... and I'm married...
I understand, sir.  Nothing like a bit on the side, eh? Bit of fugitive flesh.  The greatest aphrodisiac is a new body, wouldn't you say, sir?
 I told you, I don't want to be disturbed.
 If you want to live, don't hand up.
 They've got you bugged... They're gonna find you. Faster than you can say "Back Rodgers".  And don't bother shaking down your clothes -- the monitor is embedded in your skull.
 Who are you?  What the hell is this?
Take a wet towel and wrap it around your head.  That will deaden the signal.  It'll take longer for them to pinpoint you.
Why should I trust you?
 There's a real old saying - "Beggars can't be choosers". Go and soak your head!
Shit!
Cut the language, will ya?
It's gone!  Some...malfunction...
 Toldya the Martian assembled [stuff don't work.]
Keep talking.
 Head over to Skid Row -- to the Lucky Stub Pawnshop -- corner of Park Avenue and Fifty-eighth.  Tell the man you're Mr. Hotchkiss; you came for your Grecian candlesticks.
 What do I want with Grecian candlesticks!
Just do it!  This is no time for small talk.
 How did you know where to find me?
I've been tailing you since you get back from Mars.
You're E.I.O.  You're on the other team.
 I'm E.I.O.  But I was your best friend.  Scott Stevens - we arranged this...
 I can't remember - only bits...
 I was your fail-safe -- if and when the shooting started. Good luck.  Look me up if you remember me.
Well, look at that.  He's really got his hands full.
Not so full, so I've heard.
Quick.  The guy who checked in fifteen minutes ago.
 Room...thirty-six.
 He was only meeting a lady... Aren't you guys overdoing it a bit?
You wanta camera?  I got some good, top-quality ones.  You want silk rugs?  Handmade last century in Iran...all perfect. You want videos?  Old movies... classics...all those Vietnam war ones...real quaint stuff... you want...
 I'm Hotchkiss...I came for the...Grecian candlesticks...
 I wonder if you could tell me...
I trust these will look well in you... mosque.
 Martian money....
 What the hell...?
 "Hauser, this is Hauser -- or whatever you think your name is now.  If you're listening to this, I'm talking to myself. Your memory's been erased and you've got a wet towel around your head.  "The first thing you've got to do is get rid of that bug in your head."
The monitoring device is located in your left maxillary sinus cavity.  Make a small incision in your neck just below the left ear, and insert the wire up into the sinus.  The head is self-guiding.  Just shove.
 You won't feel a thing.  The spray cartridge contains a local anesthetic and a blood coagulant.  Careful, it's my neck, too.
It's come on again.
Where?
He's in that old flophouse. Plaza Hotel.  Central Park South.
Boy, he's really moving around.
Ya dirty rat!
 Anything?
We're running every one of his memory tapes for the past fifteen years.  Nothing yet, sir.
There must be something -- some place he would go, some friend he would run to.
 They lost him.
Again?!
 Are you sure the original suppression took?
Absolutely, sir.  He thinks he's Quail, a computer...
 Then how do you explain what he's doing?
Just his instincts.  He was well trained by E.I.O.... Maybe the memory cap's fractured. Portions of his prior identity could be leaking through.
 He'll remember Mars?  The Sphinx Project?
Fragments.  Nothing more. Nothing he could piece together. I did advise terminating him, rather than implanting an identify alternative.
What do you think I am?  A barbarian?  We're not living in the twentieth century!
 Hold it there.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll glance out the starboard viewports, you'll behold an indeed awesome sight --
Those long gorges you see, clearly are the legendary canals of Mars....
 Of course, they are not manmade canals, but vast natural chasms ...many deeper and larger than the Grand Canyon.  Though utterly without moisture now, scientists have determined that they were formed by massive flooding millions of years ago.
 Surface temperatures at the Martian equator is minus one-hundred and twenty degrees Centigrade -- in winter. Fortunately, this time of year it's slightly more seasonable: Sixty degrees, Fahrenheit, outside the domes.  Please remember, folks, that outside the domes you'll need to carry your own personal oxygen supply at all times. The atmosphere of Mars is almost a vacuum.  Thank you for flying with Interstellar and we hope your stay will be a pleasant one.
It's no Garden of Eden.
No.  Quite a bit to see, though. The canyons, the old Sphinx...
What do you know about that?
Not much, really.  Millions of years old.  Bit like the one that used to be in Egypt, you know...
Yeah.  Got destroyed in the Arab wars... What about this independence movement?
 Not worth worrying about. Mostly descendants of the original colonists from Earth. Now they want self-rule so they can sell us all the minerals... I don't think we've met.  You with our group?  Takes me a while to know everyone.
Sure.  Douglas Quail.
Richard Toltz.  Well, Doug, I hope we'll see a lot more of each other.
Smogpsucker!
You know how it is, sir.  Some of these red-asses are a bit prejudiced.
Prejudiced?  Against what?
Earthmen.
What are they singing?
The Martian National Anthem.
"...the Martian Sphinx... only evidence of non-human civilization ever discovered ...age estimated at over eighteen million years...
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Hauser.
Nice to be back.  I'm flattered you remember me.
Part of my job, sir.
 Do you remember my first name, too?
Charles.  Charles Hauser, right?
I'm impressed.  Listen.  I need transportation to the... uh... the Sphinx. Can you arrange it for me?
I'm sorry, sir.  But Earth government has sealed off the excavation site completely. No one but survey teams and archaeologists are allowed closer than twenty miles.
Oh... (spots something on the computer) Do you want the item you left with us?
What item?  Oh... yes, please.
Last Chance Air Station Kilometer 61   Gird Square T9"
Need a cab, boss mon?
 Mine's right around the corner.
 That one's closer.
But I out-hustle him, right?
 Right.
...if that intergalactic little Napoleon thinks I'm sellin' and clearin' outta here, he can think again!
 ...watcha gonna do when he cuts off the air, Luke?
...you'll be breathin' red dust and shittin' bricks.
...my wife ain't goin' on one of those space shuttles... she hates flyin'...
...aw, come on... flyin's safer'n crossin' the road...
...yeah, there ain't been a real disaster since that collision off Phobos, nigh on twenty years ago...
 ...well, that killed twelve thousand...
What is this, Bennie... Tombstone?
Sorta.  Bunch of miners out here got their own claims, from way back.  Cohaagen's buyin' em all up, says he's gonna cut off the air an' water if they won't sell...
I'm looking for Melina Noel.
You've found her.
You bastard!
 You bastard...
 That's new -- the innocent look.  You didn't have that one before.  Well?
Well, uh... I...
All right, I'll say it for you.
 Don't worry.  I got the note. You discharged your obligation.
What note?
Oh, the usual one.  "Must return immediately to Earth... the wife needs me..."
I don't have a wife.  Well, I do - but not a real wife. (getting desperate) Hell... look... someone else sent that note.  Someone who --
What are you here for?!
For you!  I don't even know why --
 Whoever I was, I must have been a helluva guy.
"Whoever you were"???
Listen.  I've for to tell  you something.  I beg you to believe me... help me --
 Something happened to my mind. Memory suppression, false implant, I don't know what --
 What I'm saying is... I don't remember you.  I don't remember us.  I don't remember me --
[And I thought...]
Who is us?
 Memory erasure is what they use on agents.  Go away.
Wait... I was an agent -- I'm not now -- just tell me who I am!  How did we know each other?  Why are they trying to kill me?!
I'm not trusting you again.
You loved me once, you must have --
That you was a liar.  Who you are now I don't even know.
Please, Melina --
 Get out!
I need your help --
 Get out!  Get the hell away from me!
You don't look so good, boss. All over the Universe, women is an awful curse.
It's a tough planet, boss.
Yeah, right.
Some guy really screwed her - screwed her up real good. Some Earthman.  Just hopped on a space shuttle.
Listen, Bennie.  You're pretty well informed?
If that means I know it all, you're right, boss.
What do you know about the Sphinx?
I don't know nothin'.  Not about the Sphinx.  That's out of the ball park.
I have to get there.  Can't you help me?
No can do, mon.  You want women, cigarettes, red-market money, booze, even air or water... Bennie's your man. But the Sphinx... that's E.I.O. --
Well... look at that one, eh?
What?
Big cheese in town.  Big smelly cheese.
Cohaagen?  But isn't he often here?
No way.  That cat just cheat the Martian workers without ever leavin' his place in Beverly Hills.  Somethin' must be cookin'.
 Mr. Hauser...
Who is it?
Mr. Hauser, I want to talk to you... about Douglas Quail.
 Who are you?
My name is George Edgemar. I work for Rekall, Incorporated.
 Rekall??
Yes.  It's difficult to explain... Could you open the door, please?  I'm not armed.
Hello, Mr. Quail.  May I come in?  I won't be offended if you prefer to keep the gun you're holding trained on me.
All right... come in.
My card, Mr. Quail.
Okay -- so you're Doctor George Edgemar of 'Rekall, Inc.'  So?
As I said... this is going to be very difficult -- for both of us.
I'm listening.
Mr. Quail... I'm afraid you're not really standing here at this moment.
Sat that again.
I said, you're not really here.  Neither am I.  We're both in the Memory Studio -- in the offices of Rekall, Inc. On Earth.
Are you trying to tell me that this is all part of some... artificially injected fantasy? That I never really left Earth?
No, not quite.  We didn't give you this.  You're creating it yourself -- (pauses, choosing his words) Remember the option we offered you?  Intelligence agent? Something inside you liked that idea, fastened on it. What you're experiencing now is a free-form delusion that you yourself are fabricating.
What is this shit you're giving me?
This is not -- shit, Mr. Quail. It's the truth.  I know it's very hard for you to accept, but you're having a schizophrenic reaction... we can't snap you out of the Narkadine.  You're in a world of your own fantasy.
Then how the hell can you be in my dream -- if you know it's just a dream?
I've been artificially implanted -- like the first part of your fantasy.  I'm actually monitoring your dream at a psychoprobe console. This is a last resort.  When somebody gets stuck in their own fantasy, we send in someone after them.  A specialist, like myself.
I don't believe a word you're saying.
I was afraid you'd think that. I'm sorry to have to do this, but you really are stuck.  Doctor Noel, would you come in now please?
Yes, Mr. Quail, I'm afraid it's all true.
 I tried to break through to you earlier, but you just molded me into your fantasy. Sometimes it takes Dr. Edgemar to get through to a client as tough as you.
 So what's supposed to happen now?
Just do exactly as we tell you.
 Somehow that doesn't appeal to me.
Please, Mr. Quail... try to cooperate.  You're having a schizophrenic embolism.
If we can't get you out now... you may never come out of it. Your wife calls every day --
If this is a fantasy, there'll be no real consequences when I pull this trigger.
But there will by consequences inside your mind.  Consequences that won't hurt me... but could be fatal to you.  If you shoot me, you'll wipe me out of your fantasy -- I can't come back again.  Because to you, I'll be dead.  I can't help you get back to reality. You'll be stuck in permanent psychosis.
You're going to lower the gun, Mr. Quail.  You're going to hand it to me --
You're going to do exactly what I tell you --
Watch out, Charles!  There's more of them in the hall!
 You've had it, Hauser!  Throw out your weapon if you want a past!
 There's an explosive in the clipboard!  He has a dead-man switch in his hand!
What do you say, Hauser?  We haven't got all night!  Hauser?
What happens it I come out?
We'll put in a word with the big boys.  Maybe you'll just get exile to Venus.
All right.  Here comes the weapon.
Back in, quick!
Wouldn't you prefer your order in your room, sir?
In!
Okay.  Answers!  Now!
They kidnapped me.  Said they'd kill you if I didn't cooperate.  I told them I didn't care, but then when I realized they meant it...
I don't know why they're after me, but what's your connection with all this?
We were together before.
Believe me, I'm really sorry I can't recall the details of that encounter.
Go, Bennie, for God's sake!
 Bad news, boss lady.
What?
Black cruiser just pull out behind us.
Forget the shooter, boss.  I lose 'em for you.
Lose them?  In this?
Hang on!
 You're gonna get a ticket for that engine, Bennie --
Yutani 650 -- you like it, boss?  Nothing like the old gas when you want a bit of speed.
You better have two aces, Bennie.  There's a second cruiser -- and it's gaining --
so that the car completely fills.  The driver continues the chase, but the occupants are now submerged.  They frantic- ally open the windows while continuing to follow Bennie's car.
I take it, then, you've failed to get him again.
 Proceed with Operation Sphinx.
But, sir...
With him... (gestures toward the mine) ...on the lose, I'm not taking any more chances. Operation Sphinx will flush him out.
What's all this?
Nothin', boss.  Just old smokies.  Only place they can come for a puff.  It's all banned topside.
So you two are into something a bit more serious than the taxi and truck-stop business.
That's right, boss.
My God!... T-shirts.  They died out on Earth years ago.
 Well, maybe we ain't fashion leaders, boss.
No.  But we still believe in a free Mars.
So where did I fit into all this?
You - when you were Charles Hauser with E.I.O - infiltrated our group.  I guess Cohaagen didn't trust you any more when you and I...
Yeah.  And I can't even remember it.  We'll have to arrange a return bout.
...so he had your memory wiped and fixed you up with a new identity.
But - the Sphinx.  Why is that stuck in my mind?  Why's it so important?
I don't know.
Just an ole heap o' stone, boss.
It's more than that, Bennie, I know it's more.  Somehow it's connected.
 Maybe there's a way  you can get your memory back.
How?  What?  Where?  When?
A bit of Martian Wisdom. We're not all stupid colonists.
He's doing it!
What?  Why?
Clearing everyone out!  It's been rumored for months...
Wow.  I can see why I was willing to betray E.I.O.
I though you believed in our cause?
Yes.  Of course.  That, too.
 Your servant, Fahreem Kuato. I greet you by the twenty-seven names that still remain, praying that you cast jewels into the darkness and given them to glow with the colors of life.
What use is this weirdo?
Ssssh...there are skills on mars that Earth has forgotten.
No need to introduce yourself, Mr. Quail. (smiles at Quail's surprise) Tolerate my presumption, but it does not tax my powers to know that you are the most sought-after man on two worlds.
 This way, my dear man.  We have much to accomplish --  -- and very little time.
The turbulence you hear outside is but a reflection of the turmoil within you. You have brought it to Mars in your search for yourself.
And you're going to help me by reading my mind?
Indubitably.  There is only small matter of a fee.
A fee!
Naturally.
This is for our cause!
 Income before ideals.  Shall we say five-hundred-thousand dollars?
 Five-hundred-thousand Martian dollars, that's... (think, calculating the exchange rate)
Not Martian dollars, Mr. Quail - Earth dollars.
That's interplanetary robbery!
With today's exchange rate... that's over two million Martian dollars!
 What price do you put, Mr. Quail, on the future of the solar system?
Aw, come off it, man.  Just for a bit of mumbo-jumbo with a crystal ball.
 Listen, buster, we're talking heavy stuff here.  You try and work out what's with this guy!
Okay!  Okay!  I'll pay it, but the Interstellar Trade Practices Commission might be interested in this.
Retrieving the past is like walking backwards along a perilous road.  The half-recalled, the half-forgotten, the repressed, the fantasies, the triumphs, joys, failures, betrayals...
 Yes... I can feel it... a wall.  Erasure techniques are so brutal. (frowns; scans harder) Blocks.  Side channels. Future and past all jumbled. I shall have to enter deep trance to break through.  I will be scanning you through the Oracle Head.
Do not fear me.  I need your openness...
 Open you thoughts to my presence...
 Open...
You have seen your past. Now read the future...
 Charles!  Are you all right?
 He kept dragging you deeper and deeper into the trance! We couldn't wake either of you!
You stopped breathing!
Why did you kill him?  It was the next bit I really...
No choice, boss.  It was him or you.
 -- the vengence you seek... and the salvation of Mars... are waiting for you in the crown of the Sphinx. 
Phobos and Demos!  What was that all about?
Are you okay?... Charles? Doug?  Whoever?
 I'm fine... only I'm not Doug -- I'm Charles Hauser... and I know everything Hauser knew.
 Bennie, where's your depot?
 Well... you go outta here... take a left, then down past the first... no second... water bureau you...
 Can you get us there?
No problem.
But why?
We're going to the Sphinx.
Impossible, man.  Guards everywhere.
The Oracle... what did you learn?
Only everything.  I've got total recall.
We'll never get near the Sphinx!  They'll blow us apart!
What are we doing, Charles? For God's sake, tell us.
The Sphinx... it's not some useless artifact, it's a machine built by some alien race eighteen millions years ago.  The same race that built the on one Earth... for the same purpose.
 This is what we need.
 It's a hunk of old stone, man.
 Purpose?  What purpose?
Come on, Bennie, move it.  Have you heard the word, "terriform"?
 Just deliverin' some old junk to the mine out at Apidalia Planitia.  Got them people you're lookin' for in the back as well.
The machine in the Sphinx is tapped straight down to the molten core of this planet. There are tunnels and ducts everywhere, all powered by fusion generators...
You sure the little man didn't fry your brain, Quail?
 For what?  To do what?
To combine elements in the Martian core and release them as oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen.
That's air!
That's right.  Air and water. Terriforming will create a permanent livable environment for Mars.  No more pressurized cities, no more containers in the desert.  There'll be rivers, vegetation - life - the same as Earth.
 So why is Cohaagen shipping everyone out?
Don't you see?!  From being a pile of red dirt with minerals, Mars is going to change into  a chunk of priceless real estate.
And Cohaagen's going to own it all!
Right!  He can start selling it off to well-heeled investors from Earth.  Beach condos, ski resorts, you name it.
No wonder he wanted you to... penetrate... out group.
 Once word of this gets out, the whole planet will support you.
So what can we do?
Ruin his little scheme by terriforming ahead of schedule - while the inhabitants are still here.
But who'll work the machine? Do you know how?
I'm the only one who does. Why do you think Cohaagen's left me alone all this time?
I was the first one inside when they cracked the riddle of the Sphinx.  It must've been programmed.  Some kind of...force...shot into me.
But Cohaagen wiped your memory!!!
 Just a way of putting me on ice.  He'd of reversed it once the planet was evacuated.
Man!  This is real complicated. Go over it again, real slow.
 What he hadn't counted on was your effect on me.
 And all without the marvels of modern science!
Bennie, don't stop now, take it...
You bastard.
Like I said.  It's a tough planet.  I'm a baddie, not a goodie.
I should have known, you were just too helpful.
EIO Rule One, man.  Trust Nobody.  Now you can do your terriforming stuff right when those space shuttles are gone.
But what about the Martian people?  Out cause?  I thought you believed in it.
Your cause?  That bunch of dead beat radicals!  When I hand in this little number... (flicks his gun in Quail's face) ...I'll get real estate rights on the whole of Chryse Planitia...
This makes Bennie a cut above anyone else.
 Hope I've got this direction right.
The air supply is off under the domes?
Yes, sir.  In a couple of hours it'll be all gone.
Any trouble with the rabble?
Not much, sir.  A lot of complaining.  But they're all heading towards the shuttle areas.
We got in with this thing, but we'll never get back out.
A shame.  Such a pleasant trip.
 This is the main tap -- straight down to the core of Mars.  When we trigger the mechanism, fusion reactors will detonate down there -- four hundred miles deep.
Remind me not to slip.
The new elements will come booming up through this shaft -- and six thousand others all around the planet.
 Stay in contact.  I want to hear from this checkpoint every four minutes.
Did you hear something?
No.  Where?
Over there.
 I'm not there, boys.  I'm here.
 Watch him.  He was EIO trained. They're all full of tricks.
Yeah?  Like...who was that guy? -- Fred Bond??  Keep 'em up, Fred, keep 'em up.
A hologram!
 Where'd you get that little trick?
 Mail-order company.  It's a great one for fooling the wife.
How the hell did they get in?
Up the fusion core.
Up the fusion core??
 They're on Level One.
Seal all upper levels.
 Know how to use one of these?
Catch! He hurls something toward the armed men in the elevator. Instinctively one of them reaches for the thrown object. It is an explosive device of some sort.  Quail and Melina press themselves against the wall just around a corner from the elevator.  There is a tremendous explosion.
Great stuff, but how do we get up?
Forget them.  We'll pick up Quail once the shuttles have left for Earth.
If you're afraid of the heights, you better get over it real quick.
If Quail's the only one who can operate all this... (gestures toward Sphinx's controls) ...then he can call all the shots.
We'll tell him the computer's worked out the operational details so we don't really need him.  We're just doing him a favor.
And if that doesn't work?
We offer him rewards.
What if that doesn't work?
We'll torture him.  You don't think I got this far by being a nice guy?
First of the shuttles ready for departure, sir.  Two minute countdown.
Seal the breach!  Repressurize!
Those shuttles are starting up any minute.  If you know how to work this thing, you better do it now.
Yes...
Don't you know how?
Yes... there's a vital connection missing...
 ...me...
Wait!
Don't wait!
If you activate the mechanism you'll die...there were glimpses of it in your memory.
Wrong, Cohaagen, there's a long tunnel, a brilliant white light, hands reaching for me...
 That's your death.  That's what it looks like.  That's what is always looks like.
 Charles - for Mars's sake....
It's not too late.  Join us again.  U've a lot to offer. A whole world.
You don't deserve a new world, you and people like you made too big a mess of the old one. Time someone else had a chance.
Am I dying?
I won't lie to you, pal. You are.
I'd say in about forty years... (he and others help Quail to his feet) ...come on, we've gotta get to the Space Port.  That Intergalactic Napoleon's switched off the air.
Shippin' us all out.  Mars is finished.
It's happening.
What is it?
That's just the start.  Next there'll be rain and growth and ... life.
 Rekall could never have come up with anything like this.
