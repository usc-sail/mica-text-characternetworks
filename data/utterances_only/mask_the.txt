Leif, let's do the deed before another night falls. The crew's near mutiny.
Know this! The first man to turn will taste my steel in his guts.
But we've surely gone far enough.
That accursed box must be thrown off the edge of the world. We will go until we can go no more...
...Land ho.
 By Odin's beard...
Be quick, Witch. Let the deed be done.
Oh Loki, ancient one. Thy mischief dwell now in waters, base and bland. And in waves and sand thy magic forever sleep...
look about fearfully.
Back to the ship men, hurry.
Captain, you've discovered a new world. It is your right to name it.
Leave that to the Italians. We're never coming back here. Never. This land is now cursed.
Yessiree, it's a four-alarm sizzler out there today with highs in the upper nineties and no relief in sight. We have a third stage smog advisory and a metro traffic gridlock alert. Flourocarbons are up, the Dow Jones is down and we're expecting another Spike Lee movie any second. In other words folks, it's just another bee-youtiful day in Edge City.
Look at those clouds rollin' in, man. Freaky weather.
Hey Charlie, can you go over these stats? We're supposed to have a complete report before lunch.
Woah. Sorry Stanley, I just had my weave tightened and my head is killing me. Be a pal and take those over to Hinkleman, will ya?
Hi guys. Did you have any luck with those concert tickets Stanley?
I sure did. Friday night, just like you wanted.
Oh, Stanley, that's wonderful.
What time should I pick you up?
Gee, I don't know. My best girlfriend just got into town and I know she'd love to go. Can we get an extra ticket for her?
Well... uh, actually it's sold out. I was kinda lucky to get these.
She's only going to be in town a couple of days and I just can't let her sit at home all alone. Are you sure there isn't something we can do?
You know what? Here. You two go.
Oh Stanley, I couldn't do that.
No really. Go ahead. It's okay. I hate concerts anyway. All that, you know... music floating around.
That is so sweet. Sheila's just going to love this.
So maybe you and I can get together over the weekend?
I'm not sure what's going on, but just give me a call. You know I like to be spontaneous.
Oh, sure. Me too.
Stanley Ipkiss, you are the nicest guy.
That's it.
What?
The kiss of death. As soon as they use the "N" word it's all over.
So maybe I am a nice guy. So what?
You are a rug. I am talking astro-turf here. You're letting these women sharpen their cleats on you.
Hey, I'm a gentleman. If they can't appreciate that, it's their problem.
You spend too much time being "nice" to a girl, you'll wind up sittin' around listening to her complain about the son of a bitch she really loves.
Charlie, you are a very sick puppy.
Wake up, Stanley! These are the nineties. We're dealing with an entire generation of dysfunctional love junkies. You can't romance 'em. You gotta confuse 'em. It's the only thing that gets their attention.  Let me demonstrate. You see that girl over there?
Hi Lisa.
 Oh, hi...
Charlie.
That's right. Sorry.
Lisa, this may seem a little odd, but my friend over there and I were having this discusion and I thought maybe you could settle it for us.
I'll help out if I can.
 Actually, I don't know... this is kind of a personal question.
That's okay. Go ahead.
Alright. Just for the sake of argument, if I wasn't a happily married man... am I the kind of guy you'd go out with?
Oh, um... I don't know.  Well... yeah. I guess I would.
Lisa, I have terrific news for you.
What?
I'm not married! Is this perfect or what? Listen, there's not a lot of women willing to come right out like that and admit they're attracted to a guy, but...
Jeez... make up your mind.
Okay. Bad example. Some of these women got so much baggage they need an emotional sky cap. I'll tell you what Stanley, tonight I'm gonna take you on a love safari, deep into the darkest heart of the urban jungle.
And where's that?
The Monkey's Paw. Hottest new club in town. It's a guaranteed skirt alert and no dead beats allowed.
So how are we gonna get in?
Woah, do I detect a little self-image problem there, buddy? You just leave everything to me. This, my friend is going to be the perfect night on the town.
Hold the phone. Killer at three o'clock.
skirt... up past her body, which through her damp summer clothes is undeniable proof that there is a God... up... up... to her face as that newspaper is tossed aside. She's a heart-stopping woman/child with a Cupid's bow mouth and ice blue eyes. In other words she's trouble. Big trouble, also known as TINA CARLYLE.
 Oh my god... A perfect dime. The dame of dames. The Moby of my dick.
Easy Charlie. You'll sprain your eyes.
Excuse me, where can I open a new account?
You've come to the right place, ma'am. Just step right this way and pull up a chair...
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a complete wreck. Will you hold this please?
Here, let me take that for you.
Thanks.
So, uh, what kind of account did you have in mind?
 Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm just terrible with things like that. That's an interesting tie Mr...?
Ipkiss. Stanley Ipkiss...
Tina Carlyle. Pleased to meet you.
The, uh... pleasure's all mine.
May I? I'm such a mess.
Oh... of course.
As I was saying about that tie. It's like one of those, what do you call them, ink blot tests.
A Rorschach test.
That's it. It looks like... um. A young woman riding bareback. You know, like a Lady Godiva or something.
Really? I don't think I can...
Or... if that's not a horse it could be two lovers. A man and a woman. That would be the woman on top, of course.
 ...Of course.
What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?
I don't know. ...Bold colors. It's a power tie, y'know? They're supposed to make you feel... powerful.
Does it work?
Sort of. It's just a tie. Now, about that account.

Hey, will you guys keep it down back there?
That's cool, man. Freeze it right there.
What do you think, Doctor?
Layout's not bad. We got us a sweet little Perkins/Jenning time lock. But them motion detectors are putting the chill on my thrill.
Can you pull it off?
Hey, you're talkin' with the Doctah, man. It's all about time and money.
Yeah, well the meter's runnin' on this one. We got less than a week.
Not cool. What about the coin?
There's plenty. And I'll be happy to invest your share.
What you talkin' about, man?
This isn't about the lousy couple hundred thou' that's sitting in that vault, Freeze. That's chump change.
Yeah? Then I'm chump number one, man.
We gotta expand your horizons Doctor. Take a look.

The Valhalla Casino. Twenty mil of glass, neon, booze and dice. World class sucker bait. The grand opening is Saturday night and it will drive this two bit club of mine out of existence. But I say if you can't beat 'em, take 'em over.
Yeah? That's Arnie the Swede's place, man and he is one ice cold meatball eatin' motha fucker.
Leave him to me. You pull off this heist and I promise you, it'll be all tits and champagne from here on in.
Hold it up right here, please.

Hold up?! No hold up! I keel you very well! I splatter your guts big time, Mr. Cowboy Man!
No! No! He only wants you to stop the cab!
 Hokay. Pardon you very much.
It's alright, Stanley.
 I hate this town. I really hate this town.
Why are you getting out here?
I gotta pick up my car.
Fine. Now don't forget. Ten o'clock at the Monkey's Paw. I've already got us lined up with a couple of authentic dimes.
Charlie, please. The last time you said that you showed up with two lesbian mud-wrestlers.
Well, I can't promise we'll get that lucky again... Later!

 Ohh... I dunno. About seven hundred bucks.
Now what can I do for you, Bub?
I'm here for the Civic.

Well, they call it Emeral Forest, actually...
Burt! Pea green Civic!
Green Civic... Green Civic. Oh yeah! Brake drums are still on order and I'm only halfway through rebuilding the trans.
But I just brought it in for an oil change!
Yeah? Well you're lucky we caught those other problems before they caused some serious trouble.
Alright. Alright. When will it be ready?
Come back tomorro...  ...First thing next wee...  ...next month?  Yeah, first thing next month. That's if we can get the parts.
What am I going to do in the meantime? I can't afford to keep taking cabs all over town.
Oh, hell... we can take care of that!  Hey Burt, bring around the loaner.  And for you little buddy, only ten bucks a day.

You know, a Rolls Canardley. Rolls down one hill canardley roll up the next. 
We are not discussing the car, okay?
Whatever you say, man.
What do you think? Pretty terrific, huh? This place make Sodom and Gomorrah look like Mayberry.
Hey, isn't that...
Right. The wet dream from the bank.  Hold on... I think I see my future ex-wife.
Hey Charlie! Charlie!
 We're in luck. It's Barbie and Pebbles.
Doesn't it bother you that all the women you know are named after cartoon characters?
We've been waiting out here for hours. Can you get us in?
No, problemo. Ladies, this is my pal Stanley Ipkiss.  Stanley's very influential in the banking business.
Hey Bobby! Bobby, buddy. What's happening man?
 This will just take a second.  Yo Nick! It's me... Charlie!
Forget it, Charlie. I refuse to stand here waiting to be judged by these power-mad steroid jockeys.
How much cash you got on you?
What?
You heard me. How much you got?
I dunno, fifty or sixty bucks.
Hand it over.
No way.
Hey, I'll pay you back! I'm only carrying plastic. C'mon man, you want to stand out here all night?
 Hey Bobby!
Charlie, how you doin' man? Long time no see.
Hey, wait a minute! Charlie!
I'm with them! Hey, Bobby!

Hey, you! What are you doing down there?
I was just looking for...  My mask.
Thanks Reno, you're the greatest.
G'night, doll.
That was a great performance, baby. But not as great as the one you pulled off at the bank.
Yeah, well don't get used to it. I'm not going to start running cons for you again, Dorian. I'm a singer now and that's it.
Oh, really? And you had such a red hot career before you latched on to me?
Who latched on to who?
Get real, Tina. You'll do what I say or I'll drop you back where I found you, slingin' hash and dodgin' horny peterbuilt drivers.
 Don't push me, Nicky. I might just take a walk I should have taken a long time ago.
 Easy, baby. Easy.  I love it when she gets pissed.
C'mere. You take a hike and who's gonna kiss you like Dorian Tyrel.
C'mon. Who?
Nobody.
 That's right, baby. C'mere.
Sorry. I never get personal in front of the help.
That broad kills me.
She just might, man. The bitch is trouble.
C'mon Doctor, lighten up.  Here's to Edge City Bank. May it crack like an egg on Easter Sunday.
Okay, Mr. Ipkiss. Try to be a little more careful next time.
Thanks Officer.
Hey, mister...
You a cop or something?
oddments.
Uh... no. They just gave me a lift.
A cop chauffeur? I never seen that before. How about you boys?
Alright, you guys. It's been a tough night. I haven't got any money. I haven't got a car. All I have is this and you're welcome to it.
Hey, man. You got us all wrong. We don't want any trouble. I was just going to ask you for the time. That's all. You got the time?
Uh... yeah.

 See, I only wanted the time! Heh, he, heh...
Manager's door flies open and MRS. PEENMAN appears. She's an old dragon in hair curlers who will probably live forever just to spite her relatives.
Ipkiss! Do you have any idea what time it is?
Actually, no.
It's three o'clock in the morning! First, you wake up the entire building laughing it up with your pals. Then, you come in and start squeak -  My new carpet! Just look at that! This is coming out of your cleaning deposit Ipkiss!
 Are you done?
...Yes.
I think I'll be going to bed now.
Hello, Milo.
Easy, buddy. I missed you too.

C'mon, Milo. I'm beat.  Okay, okay. One throw.
Easy. This is the best part.
maniacally.
 Sorry Mrs. Peenman.
That's correct. The truth is we all wear masks, metaphorically speaking. We repress the Id... our darkest desires and hide behind a more socially acceptable image of ourselves in order to cope with the frustrations of our day to day lives.
Think I'm repressed, Milo?
 Nah.
The book is "The Masks We Wear," by Dr. Arthur Neuman. Thank you Dr. Neuman.
No thank you, Dr. Neuman.

Hey Burt, pull on my finger.

No, really. Go ahead.

Hey, 40 watt... we're closed! Nobody's here.
Ah... but you're here.

Nobody's here that wants to help you.
But I'm here to help you.
Sounds like you have a little exhaust problem there!
We better do a few touch ups before you have some serious trouble.

Nice PJ's pal.
Can I help you?
You're Ipkiss? Stanley Ipkiss?
That's right.
Some kind of prowler broke in and attacked Mrs. Peenman.
 Really? I didn't hear a thing.
Then you must be a pretty sound sleeper, Ipkiss 'cause she unloaded a couple rounds of 20 ott buckshot five feet from your door.
 That's... impossible!
Excuse me?
That's... a, possible. See, I have this inner ear problem.  Sometimes I can't hear a thing.
 Is that a fact?
What?
Forget it.
Here. You remember anything unusual about last night, anything at all, call me.
Sure... thanks.
Milo, it was real! How could it all be... real?
Oh my god. I'm late!
Look, Mrs. Peenman, you gotta admit your description is pretty tough to swallow.
Then you can choke on it for all I care. I saw what I saw.
Right.  A green head the size of a pumpkin, purple zoot suit and spats. That's a pretty serious fashion risk for any self-respecting second story man.
Lt., we just got an emergency call from a mechanic on 67th Street.
What?
Some kind of assault and battery. Sound pretty bad.
 Alright. Dont' worry Mrs. Peenman, we'll find this guy for you. Officer Deluca here has a few forms you'll have to fill out.
Milo! Keys! Keys!
Good boy.

through some papers scattered all over the floor. Nothing.
What happened to you last night? The girls and I were looking all over for you.
I uh, didn't feel so good. I decided to go home early.
As a matter of fact, you don't look so good. You got to take better care of yourself, man.
How was the club?
Are you kidding? It was hotter than a pistol. Did you see the paper?
No.
Your girlfriend got a great review.
"Bombshell Explodes at Monnkey's Paw."
Ipkiss! You're forty minutes late! Every time you do that you're robbing this bank of its time and money!
Sorry, Mr. Dicky. It won't happen again.
 If you weren't so busy ogling girlie pictures you'd get some work done around here.
Ah... She's a prospective client of Stanley's, sir.
 She is? Well... Next time she comes in see that you send her directly to my office.
Yes sir, Mr. Dickey.
Look at that little creep. If it wasn't for his daddy he'd be out somewhere shakin' down school kids for lunch money.
You think she ever will come back, Charlie?
Who knows? Forget about her, Stanley. A dame like that is always looking for the B.B.D. The bigger better deal. Ask her what her sign is and she'll say dollar.
You don't know that. She's an artist. Maybe she's sensitive.
Yeah. She can sense a guy's credit line at two hundred yards. Stanley, you need a girl you can depend on. Someone a little more down to earth... someone like...
Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find Stanley Ipkiss?
Like her! Someone like her.  As a matter of fact I could use someone like her myself.  Hel-lo there. May I be of some assistance?
Stanley Ipkiss?
Hi. I'm Peggy Brandt. I'm with the Evening Star.
Oh, hi. I already have a subscription, thanks.
Oh no, actually I just wanted to ask you a few questions.
Really? About what?
Ripley Auto Finishing. You're a customer of theirs aren't you?
I... uh. No. I think you must have made a mistake.
Isn't this a form of theirs you filled out?
 Oh, that Ripley Auto. I guess I have stopped in there once or twice, Miss... what did you say your name was?
Peggy Brandt.
Wait a minute... Peggy Brandt of "Ask Peggy"?
That's right.
 You printed my letter last year, remember? "Nice Guys Finish Last."
You're Mr. Nice Guy? Stanley do you realize how much mail we got about that letter? There's hundreds of women out there who are looking for a man just like you.
Are you serious?
Of course. DO you know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town? Most of them think monogamy is some kind of wood.
Why are you covering this story?
They cut my salary. I just can't make it by on "Dear Peggy" anymore. The truth is, I want to be a real reporter and if I can break this story I know they'll let me.  Look Stanley, I know Ripley Auto is a crooked operation. They may even have had ties to the Mob. I'm not out to get you. I just want the truth.
I wish I knew the truth, Peggy. I really do.

Good afternoon, Councilman Snell. Nice of you to drop by.
Cut the crap. Dorian. What's so important that I had to come here in person?
I got a little job for you, Tom. I want you to pull the Swede's gambling license.
That's impossible. He was approved six months ago.
Pull a few strings. Find something in the fine print. I don't care how you do it, but do it. You owe me.
 I owe you nothing, you little piece of shit. I got your liquor license when nobody else would touch...

 That's pretty. What is that, a carnation?
Nice. Hey, Eddy... call my florist. Two dozen pink carnations to Mrs. Snell with my regrets over her husband's untimely accident.
 No... please. I can do it. I can make it happen.
That's smart. You're a very smart man. Now pull yourself together. Look at you.
Shut the Swede down, Snell. We'll buy him out cheap with a little collateral the bank is about to provide us.  And Gentlemen... we are going to be in the casino business.
Or it could be two lovers. That would be the woman on top, of course...
Forget her, Stanley. Ask her what her sign is and she'll say dollar.
Every time you're late Ipkiss, you're robbing this bank!
We must repress our Id... our deepest darkest desires.
Hey, are you okay.
I am now. C'mere, baby.
 Oh, Stanley!

Drop it, Tyrel!
Hello, Kellaway. You got a warrant or did you just drop by for a night cap?
I got probable cause. A couple of your boys were spotted knocking over Edge City Bank.
Easy, junior. You're givin' me a woodey.
One of them was wearin' some kind of big green mask.
For once you're on the right track, but that's not one of my men. Maybe you ought to try a little actual police work instead of this harassment bullshit.
This isn't harassment. You want to see some harassment?  Search the place, boys.
Ever wonder why you didn't make Captain, asshole? I got friends so high up they'd give you a nose bleed.
Well what d'ya know? I guess they gave you one too.
 You're a dead man.
Lt., we got a stiff upstairs. One of the guys from the heist.
 Better call that high-priced lawyer of yours, Tyrel. You're comin' downtown.
I'll be back on the streets before sunrise and you know it.
Then just think of this as the city's way of showing you a little hospitality.  I'll stop by to tuck you in myself.
You're on your own, boys.
Don't worry, Lt. If he's in there, well get him.
And if he's not, I got a feeling I know where to find him.

Oh my god!
Ipkiss! I know you're in there.
All right, I'm coming!
Lieutenant, what a surprise! What can I do for you?
You can answer a few questions.
I've got to get ready for work.
Trust me. Your bank's opening late today.
Where were you last night?
Here... mostly. Is something wrong?
Maybe, yes. Maybe, no. Maybe it's all just a crazy coincidence that this so called "Mask" character always seems to be wherever you are.
Mask -- who?
Don't insult my intelligence, Ipkiss. First, he's spotted in your building, then the bank where you work and now I find this at the Monkey's Paw.
Milo. No!  Okay, so I went out on the town last night. A guy's got to have a little fun.
In your jammies?
Naw, I just took 'em with me in case I didn't make it home. I don't know about you, Lieutenant. But I've got a pretty good track record with the ladies.
Wait a second... you smell that?
What?
 Bullshit. I hate the smell of bullshit. Don't even think about leaving town, Ipkiss. I'll be in touch.
What are we gonna do, Milo? What are we gonna do?
I don't know, boss. That's one helluva rubber mask.
Where's the lab report?
We got fingerprints on some of the currency, but nothing matches Tyrel's men. Looks like this guy beat 'em to the punch.
Get the bank's employee files and run down the prints on a guy named Ipkiss.
You figure it was an inside job?
Yeah, and all I need is a couple of prints to lock this wack job up 'till doomsday.
with stacks of money sits before Dorian.
A fifty thousand dollar reward to the man who finds this "Mask" character before the cops do. Get the word out to every street hustler and low life in this town.  I want him here. In my office. Alive. By tomorrow! Now get going!
What are you looking at?
You. You're losing it Dorian.
I'm losing nothing. Except maybe some extra baggage I don't need around here.
What's that supposed to mean?
You weren't putting up much of a fight when that green goon kissed you last night.
C'mon, did it look to you like I had a choice?
Maybe you did and maybe you didn't, but I know this, one day real soon I'm gonna run this town and when I do there's gonna be payback for anyone who crossed me.  I mean anyone.
Ipkiss! We have a crisis on our hands here and you stroll in over an hour late. If I have to put up with your slovenly...
 Back off Monkey-Boy, before I tell your daddy how you're running this branch like it's your own personal piggy bank! If the I.R.S. saw some of those files we could arrange a little vacation for you at Club Fed!
That will be all, Ipkiss.
Woah! What side of who's bed did you wake up on?
I'm not sure.  I haven't exactly been myself lately.
 Yeah, well you look like you could use a little R and R there buddy... and as a matter of fact I've got just the ticket. Or should I say tickets?
I'm afraid to ask.
Saturday night. Grand opening of the Valhalla Casino. Serious skirt alert. Everybody who's anybody will be there. What do you say?
I don't know Charlie, I...
Excuse me a second.
Tina... What are you doing here?
I heard about the robbery. I guess I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Oh, don't worry about me.  I'm fine.
Are you sure? You look a little...
I'm just having a little trouble sleeping is all.  I guess you won't want to open that account after all this...
I'm not so sure I'll have much to open an account with anymore.
What about the nightclub? I thought you were doing great.
I don't know how much longer I can stay there Stanley. Things are getting a little intense.
Well, there must be plenty of other places you could sing. Maybe even get a record deal...
I wish it was that easy. There's thousands of girls out there just like me who...
Not just like you. You've got a voice like... like an angel.
 An angel huh? That's the first time I've heard that one.
No, I mean it. You really do.
I can vamp my way through a tune. But that's not really singing.
What is it with you, Tina? Why don't you believe in yourself?
 I guess I've just heard a lot of promises from a lot of guys. In the end they all wanted the same thing and it wasn't a song.
So maybe you've been singing for the wrong guys.
I'm not so sure there's any other kind. Not for me, anyway.  Well, I'm glad nobody got hurt.
Yeah.
What about this guy, the Mask? Do the cops have a line on him?
I'm not sure. Why are you interested?
Promise you won't say anything?
Sure.
He came to the club last night and he was just so... well, different. I haven't been able to get him off my mind.
Really? They say he's pretty weird looking.
Yeah. He's ugly... but he's kinda cool... y'know, like Mick Jagger.
You really think so?
Yeah. If you hear anything about him, would you call me at the club?
Actually... I sort of know the guy.
What?
The Mask. We're - old college buddies him and I.
Are you serious?
Oh yeah. To tell you the truth, I'm sorta covering for him on this bank thing. He's not such a bad guy, really. He just gets a little carried away.
I'll say. Do you think you could give him a message?
I suppose so.
Tell him I want to see him again
When? I mean, I'd need to tell him exactly.
How about seven o'clock tonight at Peninsula Park.
I'll be... I mean, I'll make sure he's there.
Sorry, doll. I had the locks changed this afternoon.
You what? You can't do that!
You've known we're going condo for six months, Peggy. I can't stall the owner a minute longer. Either you pony up the downpayment or you're out.
Just a couple more days, Phil. The paper's ready to give me a full time job.
I've heard that one before.
C'mon, at least let me get a few of my things.
Don't make me regret this. We get a certified check by noon tomorrow or a Sheriff will escort you out of here.
Thanks Phil. You're a sweetheart.
I heard you were lookin' for a story.
Who... Who are you?
Just a guy with a little information lookin' to make a buck. But maybe I heard wrong. You don't look like much of a reporter to me.
You give me something worth printing and I'll get you your money. What's this about?
The guy they call the Mask and why Dorian Tyrel's willing to pay fifty large to get him.
How do I find this Tyrel?
Careful, sweet meat. You break this story and he just might find you.
Dorian... thanks for coming by, kid.
My pleasure, Swede. It's been too long. I was worried you were still pissed about that little thing with Harry the Hat.
That? It was nothing. He was a pain in my ass anyway. Here, sit down, sit down.
Congratulations on the new casino.
Thanks, but it might be a little early to celebrate. As a matter of fact that's why I asked you to stop by.
Is that right?
Here... have a little something to eat. That's Svenska meatballs, kid. The real thing.
Thanks.
So, I tell you Dorian, it's a terrible shame. I put all my hard work into this beautiful casino and what do you think? All the sudden I got all kinda problems with the city. Big problems. The whole deal could fold.
Maybe I can help you out. I'm expecting to come into a little investment capital shortly. If worse comes to worse and you really need to bail out...
What a sweet guy. Isn't this guy a sweetheart? Thanks for the offer Dorian, but I think maybe I can solve this myself.
Is that right?
That's right. You know that Councilman you got in your pocket?
Well now you've got 'im in your mouth. How you like that?
 Now listen close scumbag! You want to bw in business with me? Okay, we're partners now. I'm takin' fifty per cent off the Monkey's Paw. You screw with me again and I'll send you straight down to Hell with your scumbag councilman. You can apologize for eatin' him for lunch.
Sure, Swede. Take it easy.
Good. Now get out of my sight.
Oh Dorian, here's a couple tickets to my grand opening. Stop by. And try to dress up nice. It's good for business.
man we saw interviewed on "The Larry King Show." The byline reads "The Mysterious Powers of the Identities Within Us."
This is extremely unusual, Mr. Ipkiss. Barging in without an appointment or...
Look, you're the big expert on masks, right? Well, I've got an emergency here! 
Try to calm yourself. Now this woman you were telling me about, I'm not sure I understand the problem.
I've got a date with the girl of my dreams, only she doesn't know it's me...
It's this thing!
 Very interesting... looks like tenth or eleventh century Scandinavian. Where did you get this?
 I found it... or it found me. I'm not sure. The problem is it's ruining my life!
So you believe this actually changes you into a different person?
Yes!  It's turning me into some kind of lunatic! 
Mr. Ipkiss, please. This is just obsessional dellusion. What you have here is nothing more than a piece of wood.
But your book says masks...
My book uses masks as a metaphor for our complex personalities. The masks we must present to the outside world... to suppress the id. To protect our innermost desires.
Yeah, well this one works in reverse.
You're going to have to be willing to work on this delusion or...
It's not a delusion! Alright, I'll prove it to you if I have to, but I won't be responsible for the consequences.
Mr. Ipkiss please! There is no such thing as a magical mask.
 Last chance to hide all dangerous objects.
Alright then, go on. You're not going to frighten me.
Whooooooooaaaaa...
Whoa, what?
It didn't work?
Does that surprise you? The mask is nothing but a reflection of you - the inner you.
It worked last night. And the night before. Maybe it only works at night... What kind of mask did you say this was.
Scandinavian. It looks like a representation of Loki, the Norse God of Mischief. He supposedly caused so much trouble that Odin banished him from Valhalla forever.
 What if he banished him... into a mask?
 I'm sorry, Mr. Ipkiss, we're out of time.
But what should I do about my date?
Your date?
You know. Tonight. The park. Tina. Do I go as myself of the Mask?
Mr. Ipkiss, please. Haven't you been listening to anything I've been saying? Go as yourself. And as the Mask.  Because they are the one and the same, beautiful person
Yeah?
I've got that cross-check from the bank files.
And?
It's Ipkiss, Alright. Stanley Ipkiss.
You want us to pick him up?
Don't do a thing until I tell you. Just keep the SWAT team standing by. If this guy's half as bad as he's supposed to be we'll need all the help we can get.
Stanley, what are you doing here?
Oh, Tina... Hi. You're early.
A little.
I just... wanted to make sure you two got together okay.
That's nice.  You know, I hardly ever stop by here. It's hard to believe it was just a garbage heap.
 It's always beautiful at sunset. Those methane emissions really pick up the colors.
Wow. They really do. All those pinks and greens.
Well... I'm sure my cousin will be along any minute. He never shows up anywhere 'till after sundown. He's sort of strange that way.  I guess I'll get going.
No, Stanley. Stay for a second. I was thinking about what you said and I, uh, I want you to know I appreciate it. Maybe you're right. If I believed in myself a little more I wouldn't rely on guys like Dorian.
Dorian... You mean Dorian Tyrel?
Yeah. He's sort of my manager.
Tina, you've got to be careful of that guy. He's a dangerous criminal.
You really mean that, don't you?
Absolutely. You ought to hear the stories...
No, I mean, you're really worried about me. That's... real sweet, Stanley.
C'mon, Tina this is serious. How involved are you with this guy?
I can take care of myself, Stanley. I always have.
Oh, really? People close to Tyrel have a nasty habit of turning up dead, or haven't you noticed?
Look, this may sound a little cold but I do what I have to do to get by, okay? I'm nobody in this town without Dorian.
And who are you with him Tina? I'm not exactly sure who I am anymore but at least I'm trying to find out. If you really had any faith in yourself, you wouldn't be hanging on to some kind of free ride.
 I'm sorry Tina. I guess I better get going.
 Stanley... wait!
around her.
Cher! Ce moi! Je'taime, Je' taime, Je any old tame! At last we are together mon petite bon bon!
This is Kellaway. I need back up and I need it now! Every available man down to Peninsula Park.
Looks like it's gonna be a long night. My wife is gonna kill me.
What is it, Murray?
The cops got your pal Ipkiss staked out at Peninsula Park. We just picked it up over the police band.
Let me cover it, Murray! You go on home to Claire.
I don't know, Peggy. Ramsey said...
 I'll take care of Ramsey. Thanks a million. I owe you one.
Our love is like a red red rose, and I'm feeling so thorny already, I'd like to nip you in the bud!
Cigarette?
Regular? Menthol? Filter? Cigar? Cigarette? Tiparillo?
Let me get that for you!
he smokes them all down to gray ash.
 Aaaaaah. And now... amore!
Freeze!
Put your hands up!
But eu 'tol me 'oo freeze!
Alright, alright. Unfreeze! You're under arrest!
Under arrest! My god! The Law! I knew I'd forgotten something!  I was so young! So foolish! So full of life!
What... What'll they do with me, Sarge?
Sorry, son. That's not my department. Search him!

He's really a modest guy - although he's the hottest guy - in HavAAAAna - and here's what he has to saaaay -

Hey, he's not bad.

The senoritas they sing, and how they sling their sombreros --! (It's very nice! So full of SPIIIIICE--)  And when they're dancing they bring a happy ring to their vaqueros - they sing their song, all the day loonnnggg -
You go out there and I'll blow your brains out!
stinging gas seems to break the spell of THE MASK. The music suddenly STOPS and the high stepping cops stagger away from the CHORUS line, looking confused.
Goddamn it! Arrest that thing!
This way!
the Mask has now transformed back into...
Halt! Halt or we'll shoot!
Stanley! Get in!
Thanks. Where are we going?
Someplace where we'll be safe.
newspapers on an assembly line. Everything's mechanized: printing, folding, wrapping.
I saw it. I saw the whole thing. What's happening to you, Stanley?
It's crazy... I've lost all control. When I put on this mask I can do anything... be anything, but it's ruining my life.
Stanley, I don't know what's happening to you, but I do know this. That letter you sent my column was from a guy with more guts and heart than any of the creeps I've met in Edge City. Whatever this mask is, you don't need it. You... Stanley Ipkiss, are already all you ever need to be.
Gosh, Peggy. Do you really mean that?
 Actually... no.
What?
 What took you guys so long? I've been vamping here for twenty minutes.
This is him?
You have the fifty thou?
Right. When he puts on the mask he becomes that green thingamajig.
 Peggy, what are you doing?
Sorry, Stanley. You really are a great guy, but I just can't lose my condo. You know how hard it is to find an apartment in this city.
Okay Ipkiss. Where's the money from the heist?
My aparment. It's in my apartment!
Thanks. Now I believe you have a pressing engagement.
Hey, you said you wouldn't hurt him!
You're right. Easy boys. One thing at a time. Tell me about this mask, Ipkiss. How does it work?
I don't know... You just put it on!
Better be careful, boss.
Rex's under eyes that glow green with wicked power. His voice is a deep inhuman RUMBLE.
What a rush.
Whoa, boss... are you okay?
I'm better than ever, you idiot. Now stop the presses. There'll be a new headline tonight.
But what about him?
DO AS I SAY! I have other plans for Ipkiss. Everything's become so clear to me now!
Ah... excuse me. If you don't mind, I'll just take my money and be going. You guys make yourselves at home.
Must you go? What a shame. You and I could make beautiful headlines together.
Thanks, anyway. That wasn't part of the deal.
Of course. You only want what's coming to you, don't you?
Back off Freakazoid. I wasn't born yesterday.
Ah... But you might die today!
A girl like you deserves to have her face plastered all over page one.
What do we do with Ipkiss?
The police are looking for the Mask. We shall give them the Mask. And Eddy...
Yeah, Dorian?
Get the boys ready. The Swedes' expecting us at the casino opening tomorrow night. We wouldn't want to disappoint him, would we?
and elbows the other thugs to join in.
yank open the closet door and start scooping the cash into plastic garbage bags.
That money better be where you said it was, Ipkiss or you can Ipkiss your ass goodbye.
pedestrians and cross-traffic to keep the car in sight.
I still can't believe it. Hardened cops dancin' in the streets... and broadcast all over the ten o'clock news.
The SWAT team got an offer to open for Wayne Newton.
I'm history. The Captain's going to have my badge for breakfast. With a little pension on top.
C'mon Lieutenant, it wasn't your fault. Something will turn up.
Sure. Stanley Ipkiss is going to fall right into my lap...
lap -
...Ipkiss!
I can explain everything...
Don't bother.
You have the right to remain silent, you freakin' Looney Tune. Anymore of your half-baked wisecracks can and will be used against you by me, personally...
You've got to listen to me!
Stanley forces a smile.
Go find yourself a new home, Milo. It looks like I'm going to be here for a long long time...
Wake up. You gotta visitor.
About time you found me a lawyer...  ...Tina?
Hello, Stanley.
What's wrong? Your boyfriend kick you out for not delivering me on schedule?
Is that what you think - that I set you up?
I don't know. But I've got plenty of time to figure it out.
You're just going to have to trust me on this.
Now is not the best time for me on trusting women.
I ran out on Dorian last night, Stanley. I just came to tell you I'm sorry. Sorry about everything.
You ran out on him?
That magic mask of yours turned him into some kind of monster...
He wasn't exactly Mother Theresa in the first place.
He's going to the casino opening tonight and he's planning to do something terrible.
A real change of pace for him.
Half this town will be there Stanley. I tried to tell the cops, but they wouldn't listen to me.
As long as he's got the mask, there's nothing they can do to stop him anyway. There's nothing anyone can do.
There must be some way. How does it work?
 It's like it brings you innermost desires to life. If deep down inside you're a little repressed and... a hopeless romantic, you become sort of a love-crazy wild man.
And if you've got a black heart?
Then the world's going to be a very dark place. And if I were you, I'd get out of town. Fast.
Thanks.
For what?
Lots of things. For really believing in me when I couldn't. For sharing a sunset with me. For being the first guy to treat me like I was a person instead of a slab of meat.  And for being any kind of romantic. Even a hopeless one.
 You're welcome.
You know, that night at the club I knew I met someone special. Someone like nobody I'd ever met before.
The Mask.
No... the guy that was inside the Mask all the time. You. Stanley Ip -
--kiss.
Time's up, lady.
I've got to disappear for awhile Stanley. I'm not sure where I'll go but I'll let you know as soon as I can.
and heads -
 Hey! A girl's being kidnapped out there! Do something!
 Baby, there you are...  I was gettin' all worried about you.
I just went out for a little while Dorian.
Looks like maybe a long little while, right baby?
You know what happened to the last bitch that ran out on me? Do you?!
 No...
Nobody else does either. Nobody ever will.
Now fix yourself up, baby. And pick out something pretty to wear tonight.
We're going to make a big splash at that opening. One this town will never forget.

dressed to the nines for the opening. Dorian holds the mask in his lap.
It's almost time.
I wouldn't do that, Sweetie. We don't want to start the celebration early.
Now sit back and try to relax. I've got to change for the party.
on his chair unconscious.
Come on.
Ipkiss!
Hold it! I warn you! I'm seriously stressed out here!
Easy, Ipkiss. Don't be an idiot. You're in the middle of a police station. There's no way you're just going to walk out of here.
 You're right.
handcuff the two of them together.
Now what are you doing?
Putting myself in your custody.
You are certifiable.
Milo!
Okay. Now we have to hurry or we'll miss the party.
Of course. We wouldn't want to keep Alice and the white rabbit waiting.
Now move.
Don't be shy, Tina. I know how you like to make an entrance.
And I must say, that's a dress to die for. Or should I say in?

Hi Lieutenant. Where are you taking Ipkiss?

Hello tall, Nordic and beautiful. One look at you and I know how your hat feels.
Out of my way, Buster. Mama feels lucky tonight.
Now... let the games begin!
Ipkiss, I'll have you locked up for this so long sex will be safe again!
We scored over half a mil from the safe!

You can come out now, Orlando. I think he got the point.
Let me go you bastard!
What's wrong darling? This is your big production number. You of all people know how important it is to go out with a bang.
Eddy... How goes it?
All set boss.
Excellent. The real party starts now and ends in...  Thirty minutes.
Okay. When I push the red button the safety is off, right?
I'm not helping you, Ipkiss.
Alright, suit yourself.  You stay and be a good boy.
Hey, watch it! Oh, Arnie...
Swede... my dear, dear business partner. And Mayor Tilton! What a surprise. We have just enough time left to play my favorite game!

Whoaaaaa!
Pssst. You guys. Over here.
Stanley! What are you doing here?
Start sneaking people out the back. Watch out for the oil.

Let me offa this thing, you lousy scumbag!
Sorry Swede. I've got an ax to grind with you. In fact I got a couple and I'm afraid they may give you a splitting headache!
Round and round she goes. Who dies first, nobody knows!
Stanley!
Hang on, Tina.
Stanley, look out!
How touching! The two love birds. Just to show you there's no hard feelings, I'm going to let you spend the rest of your lives together.
You've got it all wrong! I could care less about this creep. Nobody could replace you, Dorian. Nobody!
If you think a line like that's going to save your life, you're dumber than he is.
 Okay. Maybe it's too late. Then all I want is... a kiss.
A kiss?
One last kiss.
 Sure, why not...
her head way.
No! From the real Dorian. The guy I used to love.  Nobody ever kissed me like Dorian Tyrel.
No time, boss. This building's going down any minute...
I make the decisions! And I've decided...
...to give the girl one last thrill.

C'mere, you ugly little mutt...
Whoa!
Don't let it get away!

Get him off me!
C'mon! We've got the money. Let's get the hell out of here!
I gotta have that mask!
 You did it...
Milo! Milo, come!
Stanley... we made it. We're alive!
regular dog.
I'll take that.
Hold it right there or you'll be looking for this on the bottom of the harbor.
Drop it and I'll kill you all.
You can have it. But she gets to go.
Fine.
Go where?
Swimming. We're still close to shore.
Five seconds, Ipkiss.
Go ahead. Hurry...
Okay. Put it down. Right over there.
 Stanley! The dynamite!
...Stanley?
What a BLAST! This mask makes me a god!
I'm immortal...
Do you hear? I'm immortal!
Back to jail, Lieutenant?
Ipkiss, I'd like to lock you up for the rest of my life. But the mayor and a hundred other witnesses say Dorian Tyrel's the bad guy and you're the good guy. So no jail. Just a downtown parade at noon.  And I've got to be your escort.
Valkyrie change girl.
So I deck this thug, grab his gun and tell Stanley, "Take cover, Buddy. I'll get these folks out sae and sound." Y'know we should go back to my place so I can tell you the rest of the story.
Just look at this mess...
So what do you say, sweetheart? Let's you and me go back to my place and scramble some eggs.
Witch Hazel face and Bride of Frankenstein hair.
Hello short, dark and handsome! C'mere and give Momma a kissy-poo!
 Yah! Put me down!
Let's see what caliber pistol you're packing there, soldier boy!
PANS with Mrs. Peenman as she RICOCHETS after him hooting laughter. We ENDFRAME on Stanley and Tina as they watch the BIZARRE spectacle pass them by. They turn and embrace for a well deserved kiss as Milo yips happily and squirms up between them.
