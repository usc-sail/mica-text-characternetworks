Mister Humphries!
You were late again this morning. Now normally I'd let it go but it's been brought to my attention that you're not paying attention to the way you space the cans. Many young men of your age in these uncertain times-

Helping hand acceptance corporation, Marlene speaking.

But you know something?

Cracks me up.
Somebody pissed  on the floor again?
Maybe he's looking for a job? Huh budsky?
Could be? What do you say kid were always on the look out for a few good men.
Screw  that! Ain't going to be no repo man. No way!
You find one in every car. You'll see.
Come in Officer Labeef do you read me?
Chuck will you stop fooling around?
I've never seen the like of that.
I have the stats on that car Officer Labeef.
Ten-forty Baker
What could have done that to him? Gasoline? Napalm?
It happens sometimes. People just explode. Natural causes.
What?
Suspect presence on west coast confirmed. Do not notify police.
Night watchman in Pomona.
Yep.
Asbestos worker. City of industry.
Yep Yep!
French fry maker Agoura. Ha Ha that's absurd.
Yeah? Well you think it's funny huh? There's fucking  room to move as a fry cook, man. You know I could be manager in two years? King! God! 
You know Kevin, I had this wild fucking dream the other night.
I bet.
It was with you and me and we were working in this sleazy shithole  motel down in Miami, Florida. And we were bellhops and we were sixty-five years old. It was so real it was really real, realistic.
And then what, you woke up in a puddle ?
Fuck you!
Fucking  jerk.
Where you going asshole ?
Away from you.
Edge City, also the name of the film's production company, is a recurring theme in Tom Wolfe's "Electric Kool-Ade Acid Test".
Mother, father. Got anything to eat?
Occasionally we get a letter from a viewer that says now the only reason Reverend Larry comes on your television set is because he wants your money. And do you know what? They're right! I do want your money. Because god wants your money. So I want you to go out and mortgage that home and sell that car and send me your money. You don't need that car.
Put it on a plate son you'll enjoy it more.
I couldn't enjoy it any more mom MMM MMM MMM This is swell.
Dad? Hey Dad?
What is it son?
Do you remember that you once told me along time ago. Well not too long ago but ummm. That you told me that you'd give me a thousand dollars to go to Europe if I finish school. Well you know something? You were right. About finishing school that's ah that's what I'd like to do. But umm I want to know if I could have the money first. Like now. [You know I really love you Dad I've always loved you. You too mom. What do you say?
I don't have it anymore.
What?]
You father gave all our extra money to the Reverend's telethon, Otto.
Well what about me?
You're on the honor roll of the chariots of fire. Same as us, Otto. It was a gift. From all of us jointly.
We're sending bibles to El Salvador.
So how much do I get paid, twenty-five buck a car.
Paid? You don't get paid. Are you kidding, you work on commission, that's better than getting paid.
Most cars you rip are worth two or three hundred dollars. Fifty thousand dollar Porsche  might make ya five grand.
It helps if you dress like a detective, too. Detectives dress kind of square. People think this guy is a cop. They're going to think you're packing something. They don't fuck  with you so much.
Are you?
Am I what?
Packin' something.
Ha. Only an asshole  gets killed for a car. Guys who make it are the guys who get into their cars at anytime. Get in at three A.M. get up at four. That's why there ain't a repo man I know that don't take speed.
Speed huh?
I'll call you back!  Flippin general telephone.
C'mon.
Never broke into a car. Never hot-wired a car. Kid. I never broke into a trunk. I shall not cause harm to any vehicle nor the personal contents thereof. Nor through inaction let that vehicle or the personal contents thereof come to harm. That's what I call the repo code kid. Don't forget it etch it in your brain. Not many people got a code to live by anymore.
Hey! Hey look at that. Look at those assholes  over there.
Ordinary  people I hate 'em.
Me too.
What do you know? See an ordinary person spend his life avoiding tense situations. Repoman spends his life getting into tense situations. ! Lets go get a drink.
Tense situations kid. Get into five or six of them a day and it don't mean shit  anymore. I mean I seen men stabbed and it didn't mean shit . I've seen guns. Guns too they don't mean shit  but that's when you got to watch your self. Here I'll handle it pal. Uh settle down.
Have a nice day. Or night. Night, day, it doesn't mean shit .
Wasn't that Otto?
Otto who?
You gotta watch yourself. (takes off mask) Have a nice day . . . night.
This is what I call phase 2 ace. If the dealer don't have the keys, you call the truck. And it is a heartbreak to be sitting waiting for the truck and the giblet comes out and drives it away. Once you've got this baby on the hooks, she's all ours.
Oh no you don't. I'm nipping this in the bud right now. You are not going to take this car. I know my rights. There is absolutely no way you're going to take it.
Uh, are you miss Luann Pakman?
Obviously not. I'm Arthur Pakman. Luann is my daughter. Now you're going to have to take this matter up with her.
Well don't think I haven't tried, sir, but she hasn't had the decency to call us in months. I mean, I've skipped trace this car all over town.
Well, uh, Luann is sick. Now the damn car isn't working anyway, and I know, I know that's why she hasn't paid you.
Well, she could have called us? Look, all you've go to do is call my branch manager, I will abide with whatever he says.
What, and lose my job? The law requires that I stay right here until you call my branch manager.
That's the law?
That's the law.
I'll be right back.
There's going to be some bad shit coming down one of these days kid.
Oh yeah? Where you going to be? On the moon?
Ung Uh, I'm going to be right here heading north at a hundred and ten per.
In this junker?
Cool car.
Uh Oh! The Rodriguez brothers.
Motherfucker just flipped you off.
Roll the window down.] Roll the window down.
A donde vas, pendejo?
A chingas tu esposa!
Hey Bud, hey Bud, who's your new girlfriend?
Watch it mother fucker. (Girlfriend? watch it melonfarmer!)
Hey fuck you pussy punk. (flip you, you punk.)
Holy shit.]
Want me to take them?
Wo! Hey!
God damn dipshit Rodriguez gypsy dildo punks. I'll get your ass!
HAHAHA WOW! That was intense.
Repo man's always intense. Come on let's go get a drink.
Gee bud. You never told me it was going to be like this man. Cops and robbers. Hahahahah. Real live car chases. Hahahahah.
Shit ! Debbi!
If you say our names we'll have to kill all these people Archie.
They all ran away.
Come on you douche bags. (come on, get the lead out.)
Awful quiet in here. It's too quiet.
So who are these Rodriguez boys.
Rodriguez brothers. Lagarto and Napoleon. Two notorious delinquents currently responsible for at least thirty vehicles in the field.
Scumbags
They ain't scumbags. They car thieves just like use.
There's Miss Magruder. You want to go for it?
Good gag, you pull this one a lot?
Only on the women. It never fails.
Excuse me? Miss Magruder? I have something here for you.
Uhm how utterly charming.
Ow! Ow! Ow! Motherfucker! Ow! Ow! Ow! Christ! I'm blind man. Lite? Lite, where are you man?
Ruthside Peason brokerage consultant. Fucking  millionaire six payments behind. I've never understood it.
What's that?
The fucking  millionaires. They never pay their bills. See you at the yard.
Let me get this one.
No. I'll handle this one. Mister Peason is carrying a permit for a pistol.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Give me that.
Don't underestimate me ace.
And also, naturally, I'd like them to be right next to each other. In addition I'd like them to be as close to the window as possible so I can sit in my car and watch my things. So all you have to do is take your clothes out of here like this and put them into a machine over there like that.
Oh my god ! Stop!
Hey! Hey! You want a ride? Hey babe need a ride?
Pick it up! Look at you. You pick it up. You know yourself you were wrong.
Well what were they doing out in the middle of the street?
They weren't in the middle of the street. That not the middle of the street that's the corner.
Go on you pick it up.
What?
You pick it up.
Haha, no way. You still want a ride or what?
No I don't.
My name is Otto.
Leila. Is this your car?
Yeah it's one of them.
Heh, one of them? You think you're pretty slick don't ya? I bet you're a used car salesman.
I am not.
You dress like one.
I'm a repo man.
What's that?
Its a repossesser. I take back cars from dildos  who don't pay their bills. Cool huh?
No.
What are you doing?
Those men in the car next to us don't look at them. Don't look at them! If they see me they'll kill me.
Really why?
Ow! What the hell are you doing?
What's going on?
Take a look at this.
What's this? It looks like sausage.
It isn't sausage Otto. That's a picture of four dead aliens.
HAHAHAH
Laugh away fuckface  that picture is going to be on the cover of ever major newspaper in two days time.
How do you know that?
Part of a secret network. A scientist who is also in our secret sect smuggled the corpses off of this air force base. Now he's got them in the truck of his car. It's a Chevy Malibu. We've got to find him.
What are you going to do with them, put them on Johnny Carson?
Yes! We're going to have a press conference and tell the world.
Ehw. What's that? I don't know dear. But it is alive. It seems friendly though. Aw look it's curled up. How cute oh no. Maybe we can take it home it doesn't seem to have any. Oh yes let's. But no! No matter how appealing do not let strange creature in you house. We all know strange creatures are on the increase. Many of them do seem furry and adorable, but beware we don't know from whence they came. Be safe. Be safe. Report strange incidences today. (continues in background)
United fruitcake outlet.
My door doesn't open.
Thanks for the ride.
Sure Ummm I don't know. what do you think? Ah want to go out with me again sometime?
I don't know. I'm going to be kind of busy with work, the Malibu and everything.
Hey great. Terrific. Here's your shit .
What's your problem? I mean girls might like you if you lightened up a little bit.
Fuck . Girls pay to go out with me. All right?
You wanna get back in the car?
What, here?
Yeah.
Twenty thousand dollars for a Chevy Malibu?
Who's double X finance?
Store front operation, but the money is in escrow.
Want me to notify the boys?
Uh, naw. They're always bitching about their case load. I think I'll go out for a while.
Why? We out of beer?
Somebody has to work around here. Keep making me money kid.
Fuck  you.
Man we've been looking for this little red devil for a long time. Just act natural. Nobody knows if its your car or somebody elses car.
Now you work with that. You give it a try. All right?
Let me give you a hand we dont have a whole year to find it boy.
Got it.
Lets get out of here. Put your seat belt on.
Put your seat belt on boy! I don't ride with anybody unless they wear their seatbelt. It's one of my rules.
Put that damn gun down boy. It ain't no toy.
I walk into someone's place of work. They shit  scared. They know I'm not a cop. They think I've come to kill 'em and I would. I'd kill anybody who crosses me. You know what I mean?
Do you like music?
Sure.
In that case you're going love this.
I was into these dudes before anybody. Partied with them all the time. Asked me to be their manager. I called bullshit on that. Managing a pop group hey that ain't no job for no man.
You read that book I gave you?
What book?
Dioretix. Science of matter over mind.
Unh uhg
You'd better read it and quick. That book will change your life. Found it in a Maseratti in Beverly hills.
A lot of people don't realize what's really going on. They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidences and things. They don't realize that there's this like lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything. I'll Give you an example, show you what I mean. Suppose you thinking about a plate of shrimp. Suddenly somebody will say like plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp out of the blue no explanation. No point in looking for one either. It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness.
You eat a lot of acid Miller, back in the hippie days?
I'll give you another instance. You know the way everybody's into weirdness right now. Books in all the supermarkets about Bermuda triangles, UFO's, how the Mayans invented television. That kind of thing.
I don't read them books.
Well the way I see it it's exactly the same. There ain't no difference between a flying saucer and a time machine. People get so hung up on specifics. They miss out on seeing the whole thing. Take South America for example. In South America thousands of people go missing every year. Nobody knows where they go. They just like disappear. But if you think about it for a minute, you realize something. There had to be a time when there was no people. Right?
Yeah. I guess.
Well where did all these people come from? hmmm? I'll tell you where. The future. Where did all these people disappear to? hmmm?
The past?
That's right and how did they get there?
How the fuck  do I know?
Flying saucers. Which are really? Yeah you got it. Time machines. I think a lot about this kind of stuff. I do my best thinking on the bus. That how come I don't drive, see?
You don't even know how to drive.
I don't want to know how. I don't want to learn. See? The more you drive, the less intelligent you are.
You know I think I saw one of those things once. One of those UFOs. I mean it was really it was kind of kind of scary. I saw all these colored lights and, uh, sounds. I mean sounds and lights like I never heard before. I mean it was really weird.
Bud.
Yeah?
Do you think all repo men follow the code?
Of course. Well I mean you see a lot of fucked  up cars come in but...99 time out of 100 it was the customer who fucked  them up. Assholes .
I'm offering a thousands dollars for his Falcon. You know what that is Napoleon? It's a bribe.
Who the hell is this? Napoleon? Who the fuck  are you calling?
It's a grand if you show me where his car is Napoleon.
Ahh. Go fuck yourself asshole.]
Hello? Prick .
Sixty-four Chevy Malibu. Twenty grand.
Waiting!
We could buy ten of them for that, Marlene.
Think you can find it now?
Now how come this junk is worth so much? What's in it? Drugs?
Los Hermanos Rodriguez don't approve of drugs.
Neither do I, but it's my birthday.
That motherfucker's still down there.]
Don't care how long it takes, dildos . Repo man's got all night every night.
twenty thousand dollars.
Hey Leila! All right, um, this is Otto. The guy who gave you a ride and stuff. I heard something about that car.
Otto. Otto stop. You said you had something to tell me.
Otto? Otto!
Huh?
What did you want to tell me?
Oh! Take off your clothes.
I'm at work, Otto!
Oh yeah? Me too.
Your work is different than mine.
Says who?
What are you doing.? Don't do that.
Well the least you could do is give me a blow job.
Heh, I guess that means no.]
Leila? We have a cell meeting in two minutes time.
Thanks Deadra. I'll be right there.
See that motherfucker only thinks I don't know what's going on, Lite. As soon as I find that Chevy I'm going indy. I'm going to buy myself a tow truck, a couple of pitbulls, and run a yard. Sit around and watch everybody else do the work for a while .
No way you can do that on twenty grand man.
The hell I can as long as you have good credit and my credit is spotless.
If I find the Malibu, you won't see me for dust, I'm going to move to Mendecino County, raise me a bumper crop of tomato plants.
Credit is a sacred trust. It's what our free society is founded on. You think they give a damn about their bills in Russia? I said do you think they give a damn about their bills in Russia?
They don't pay bills in Russia. It's all free.
All free? Free my ass, what are you a fucking  commie? Huh?
No I ain't no commie.
Well you'd better not be I don't want any commies in my car. No Christians either.
I'll deal with you later. I've got a customer to attend to. You too.
Hi! I'm Kevin. Vacuum sir?
Need a vacuum sir?
You don't want to eat from a machine. Look, there's a nice Del Taco across the street. They've got enchurritos and everything.
Lorna Doones? I love Lorna Doones.
Oh hey! You want me to check the trunk? Scuze me.
Hi! I'm Kevin!
Hey buddy! How you doing? Huh? Hey don't you remember me? I was here yesterday. Heh. Listen I think I left a book of matches over in your office over there. You want to go and check for me huh?
Sure thing.
Hey thanks a lot buddy.
Any thing for you babes.
All right, you're beautiful. I love you.
I'll be right back.
What??
It's really very simple Mrs. Parks. You don't want me to take your car and I don't want to take your car. Now I said to the boss I said ah Look! I do not want to repossess this ladys car.
Well I've been in the hospital you see.
Yeah, Yes I understand. My job is really on the line over this one. I could lose it right away.
I'll see if I can borrow some money from somewhere.
That's terrific. Really terrific.
Oh how was the rehearsal son?
Oh this is Mr. Otto. He's from the finance company. He's been telling me that he isn't going to take the car this time, even though he could.
Well, uh, gotta get going here.
Did you like the tea?
The tea?
Uh huh?
Yeah, it was terrific.
Thank you
You're welcome.
Uh excuse me.
I gave you the money last week to pay it and you didn't do it. What did you do with it? I'm so tired of giving you money and you squandering it. I know what you done you all went out dancing some where. That's what you did. Next time I give you some money I want you to put it in the car ya hear. You're working. How come you didn't do it huh? I don't know what's happened to you. 
Hey it's cool. It's cool. I like music too man, hey
Some people aren't cut out to be repo men. Why don't you smarten up kid?
Fuck  you Plettschner! OWW! OWW!

Happy face! You want a ride?
What do you want from me?
We ask the questions.
You're not going to torture me are you?
Torture you? What for?
To find out what I know. I'd torture someone in a second if it was up to me.
Huh? Why are you looking for the Malibu?
Because of the trunk. The aliens inside.
Illegal aliens?
No, Silly, Extraterrestrials.
Ahhh, heh. Did you ever think about joining the CIA?

Damn right just like John Wayne what's wrong about that?
Greatest American that ever lived.
John Wayne was a fag .
What did you say man?
Whaa?

John Wayne was a fag.]
The hell he was.
He was too you boys. I installed two way mirrors in his pad in Brentwood. And he'd come to the door in a dress.
Ah, you're fucking  nuts.

Hey take it easy. Take it easy. The guys head is hurt.
This is too personal sonny. The thing is a repo man got beat up in the line of duty. Now it doesn't matter that that man was you. What really matters is that the guy that did it has got to pay the price. Now stop being selfish and tell us his name.
Come on.

Helping hand acceptance corporation. Marlene speaking.
Hello, is Otto there?
It's for you. A girl.
Yeah.
Hi Otto? It's Leila.
Leila who?
I can't believe I used to like these guys.
Listen to me! For the sake of this and future generations you must tell us everything you know.
Yeah. Sure. I need another drink.

Bollocks. Here. (tosses Otto a bag of popcorn)
Otto?
Yeah I'm here man.
The lights are growing dim. I know a life of crime led me to this sorry fate. And yet I I blame society. Society made me what I am.
That's bullshit . You're a white suburban punk, just like me.
But it still hurts.
You're going to be all right man
Maybe not.
Yep he's dead all right.
No doubt about it.
He's a goner.
Man.
Don't touch the body, don't touch the body.
Sorry.
Telephone call for you agent.
Don't bother me now.
But Agent Rogersz, it's the Gipper.
Look.
Booth's setting him on fire
Haven't seen you in a while, Son.
No escape...
Some men were just here looking for you, Otto.
No salvation from the blistering files of eternal damnation. For in these days there shall be hell in time, there shall be war and more war, and earthquakes in diverse places...
What kind of men?
Very nice young men. They wore sunglasses.
Well, what did you tell them? Did you tell them I was sick?
We told them the truth, son. Gave them your address at work.
Money shall run out and the people will line up at the banks and there won't be anything . . . these prophecies are in your bible. The same one that you have in your home. Now I want you to get up off of your sofa and put that beer down and go wherever it is in your house pick up that book and turn with me...
Where's the car baby? That Chevy Malibu baby. Where's the car?
Otto!
Jeeze.
You got to stay out of this.
Why?
It's none of your business. You want to be a hero? Or would you rather be a chicken man?
What?
A chicken man. Did you ever see a farmer's wife? Huh?
Let go of me!
It's peaceful man.]
The Malibu.
Yeah?
Let's go
No way Marlene.
My car's gone and we're going to get to the bottom of this.
Like hell we are.
Not in my face.
Hold it Marlene. Freeze!
My Face!
Over my dead body.
That's how it's going to have to be.
Come and get me. Come on.
I've been wanting to do that one for a long time honey.
Come on. Come on. Come on if you think your man enough.
Hey Fletch. Coffee break.
Good evening Otto. This is agent Rogersz. I'm going to ask you a few questions. And since time is short and you may lie, I'm going to have to torture you. But I want you to know it isn't personal.
Look Ah this isn't really necessary. I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Good! Where is the Malibu?
I don't know. Somebody ripped it from the yard.
I don't think he knows.
Increase the voltage.
But what if he's innocent?
No one is innocent. Proceed.
Ah yes! Look at them. High heels, hair nets, those ridiculous trench coats. They're pathetic.
But agent Rogersz, they're getting away.
That's all part of the plan.
Otto, Otto pull your self together.
Marlene? What's going on?
We're going to the hospital.
Hey, I know you. You're the one that run into my trash.
Shh!
Shhh to you too.
Out of order. Take the stairs.
Dr. Benway and Mr. Lee are both characters from "The Naked Lunch"
Otto?
Let me see that. All wrong do it over.
They're going through it all the and they won't pick it up.
Oh well isn't that a shame.
Oh tell you it comes to something when they expect you to pick it up.
How are you doing man?
Ask him about the Malibu.
Look about the other night. I'm sorry I split. I know I should have stayed with you but ah it's like when I was a kid you know I I had this set of big wheels you know.
Otto!
Shit . (starts to get up off of the bed)
Praise the lord.
Go. Go. Go.
Come on. Let's go.
Dude slow down.
All right don't shoot come on all right all right
Chicken shits . braak-braak-braak
Where's the Malibu?
Don't even ask because I don't know. I mean I don't have it Marlene doesn't have it you and your crazy friends don't have it. So that only leaves...
Where is he.
Where the fuck  is he.
Later!
Bye, Bye.
That's some weird fucking shit (filthy stuff) Eh Bud? What's going on man?
Shit ! Eleven years of repoing cars and what have I got? Shit !
Bud listen to me. You're sitting in a car worth twenty thousand dollars. Look look we we turn it in we take the money and split it sixty forty. You and me.
