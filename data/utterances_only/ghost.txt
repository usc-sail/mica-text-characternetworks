What a mess!
I told you!
I can't breathe.
Use your mask, dummy.
 "Volga boat..., man." Whoomph!
Sam, look, there's a whole eight feet up there.
And about eighty years of dust.
We have all this height, Sam. We could add a second floor and put our bedroom upstairs. That would leave all this space.
 For what?
For space. Just space.
Be great for bumper cars.
Sam, this may be none of my business, but I'm concerned you're doing too much coke.
Hey, Sam, turn around.
 How 'bout me?
I'll never wash again.
All together now. One, (they strike the wall with their hammers. The wall shakes) two, (they pound again. The wall begins to give) three.
Hey, look what I found. There's a penny inside.  For luck in our new loft. It's a good omen.
 You're the good omen.
It's gorgeous.
You guys lucked out. Hell, I bet you could sell it tomorrow and double your investment.
Sell it? Carl, we just bought it.
What I wouldn't do for a place like this.
It's gonna be great.
Oh, by the way, Sam, I had to move your 3:00 with Bob Kahan to 4:00 so you could squeeze in Gary Alan. He called yesterday and said he has to see you today about the Danway stuff. Three o'clock was the only time he could make it. Also, the board meeting in L.A. has been confirmed for the 12th. I got you on a 9:00 a.m. flight.
 Hey, Sam, relax. This isn't brain surgery you're going into.
I hate pitching to these Japanese guys. They make me nervous. I mean, what am I supposed to say, "Who do you think'll win that big Sumo championship"?
Sam, you'll be fine. You're great with people.
 Hey, nice. I like those.
...Molly.
Jesus, look at that, a Testerossa. That's the car I'm gonna drive when I'm making two hundred grand.
Better pay off your Mustang first.
So Carl, what did the doctor say?
He said it was contagious. Very contagious. I shouldn't be going into work today.  But what could I do?
And what about the rash?
Not good. It's spreading everywhere.
On your genitals again?
Everywhere. He said be sure not to touch anyone.
Morning, Mr. Wheat.
Morning Rose. Listen, when the Kobiashi people arrive, have Elenore take them right to the...
They're already here.
They're early!
I know. And Andy Dillon called. He said they need $900,000 transferred to Albany by noon.
Noon? Damn!
Hold on.
Listen, Dillon needs $900,000 in Albany by noon. Can you transfer it to his payroll account?
Sure. Just let me have your MAC code.
Discretion, huh?
You bet. I'll do it right away.
 Good morning, Gentlemen. On behalf of Market Security Bank & Trust, I welcome you to our city.
Arigato.
I'm afraid that's the only Japanese I know. But I realize it's not our language fluency, or lack of it, that brings you to Market Security. Rather, I'm sure, it is our banking expertise, our ability to represent and anticipate all of your banking needs. As you know, we are not the largest banking establishment in New York. (his throat goes dry and he takes a sip of water) But, with combined assets of over 200 billion dollars, we have a firm commitment to the international marketplace.
Excuse me. (he picks up the receiver) Hello?
A man and a woman are lying in bed when the woman's husband suddenly comes home. Frightened, she tells the man he has to leave instantly through the window. He has no time to dress.
Uh hmm.
It's raining outside. The man, running naked along the street, sees some joggers approaching.
 One of the joggers calls out. "Hey, do you always go jogging naked?" And the man says, "Yes, always."
Okay.
And then the other jogger says, "And do you always wear a condom?" The man looks down, embarrassed, and replies, "Only when it's raining."
Well, that's just fine.
Now just relax and have fun, okay? It's not the end of the world if you lose this account. You've always got me.
Thank you. I'll remember that.
See ya.
Where you guys from, the New York City Ballet?
Saved your life.
You bastard. Don't do that to me. You scared me half to death.
Better than seeing this gorgeous body splattered all over the street. Here, look out.
Sam? Molly? Anybody home?
Carl? Did you invite him?
 I couldn't keep him away.
Hi, Moll. Hi, Sam. So, how's it goin?
Where do you want this?
In the bedroom.
Wow! The place looks great. Really great.
You like it, huh?
"Like" is hardly the word. I never imagined it would be this beautiful. This is incredible.
Sam, you kept that chair?
What do you mean? It's comfortable. For T.V. I love that chair.
But it doesn't go with anything.
It goes with me.
It's okay, I'll paint it.
It was the middle of December. I was sitting in my old office, the one Charlie's in. Suddenly, I heard this woman screaming. I thought someone'd been shot or something.
They took away my MasterCard. It was Christmas, for godssake.
She was four thousand dollars over her limit.
It wasn't four thousand. And I'd already sent in the payment! You're the ones that lost it.
She's still angry.
No I'm not.
Get outta here, Frank! (the cat scampers away) You should have seen her. All pink and flushed. Her skin was gorgeous, like a rose. And she's screaming, demanding to see the president. So Wilton brought her to me.
You? You weren't even a VP yet.
She didn't know that.
Can you believe it? And the next thing I know, he's telling me his life story. I couldn't believe it. Everything. About his divorce, how he'd just arrived in New York, how he didn't know any women. And all with this Montana accent.
What's a Montana accent?
The one you always slip into it when you get nervous. "Yes, Ma'am. Thank you, Ma'am. Can I fondle your breasts, Ma'am?"
 I wasn't nervous.
Admit it. You liked me. You were interested.
 I thought you were cute.
Cute?  Do you believe this? I should have been Picasso's mistress. I should have been living in Barcelona or Paris. But no, I'm moving in with a New York banker who thinks I'm cute.
What are you doing?
I felt inspired.
At 2:00 am?
 You notice Carl's eyes today? They were all over you.
What? Are you jealous? Sam, let me tell you something. He's not even looking at me. It's you he idolizes. He doesn't see me at all... Anyway, he's not my type.
 What are you doing?
I feel inspired.
What's the matter?
The matter?
I can tell.
Nothing... really.
You're worried, aren't you? About moving in together?
No. Not really.
Then what? The promotion?
I don't know. A lot of things. I just don't want the bubble to burst... Whenever something good happens to me I'm just afraid I'm going to lose it.
You know what?
What?
I love you. I really love you.
Ditto.
Oh Jesus. Another one.
Don't watch that stuff.
...It is estimated that 34 people died in the crash, the second in less than two weeks.
I should cancel my L.A. trip... These things always happen in threes.
Threes? Sam, get serious. Besides, you lead a charmed life.
Yeah. So did they.
 Amazing, huh?  Just like that. Blackout.
A glitch. What's up?
The Mark Greenberg and Larry White accounts. I can't get in. Your MAC code doesn't work.
I changed it.
Why? What's up?
Nothing. I just want to nose around a bit... Can you keep your mouth shut?
Yeah, sure. Tell me, what's going on.
I think I've stumbled onto something. There's too much money in these accounts.
Too much money. That's ridiculous. How could there be too much money?
That's what I keep asking myself.
It must be the computer.
I've been checking.
Yeah, Mr. Fixit. (he hits the computer like Sam did and laughs) Come on, move over. Let me see what I can do.
Not yet. I'm gonna dig around a bit.
Okay, okay. Just call me when you're ready for help. (he heads for the door) So, what are you and Moll doing tonight?
We're going to the theatre. She wants to see "Macbeth" at the Spring Street Repertory.
I loved it.
I could tell.
 Did I tell you what Marcia said?
Six times.
Six? No I didn't. Sam, don't be so blas. I'll have two major pieces in the show. The New York Times reviews her gallery all the time. This could be huge.
Molly, the "New York Times" is some frustrated little critic with pimples on his ass who flunked out of art school. Who cares what The New York Times thinks?
Eight million readers, that's who.
Your work's beautiful. That's a fact, Moll. It doesn't matter what anyone thinks.
 I want to marry you, Sam.
 What?
I've been thinking about it for days. More than thinking. I want to do it. I want to jump in whole hog...  What is that look for?
 It's just been so long since... I mean, you never wanted to talk about it.
Do you love me, Sam?
What do you think, Moll?
How come you never say it?
What are you talking about?
You say "ditto". It's not the same.
People say "I love you" all the time. It doesn't mean anything.
Sometimes you need to hear it.
What should we do?
Let me handle this.
Your wallet!
Give it to him!
Take the money. Just leave the wallet and my...
Sam, No!
Sam!!!!!
Molly!
No!!!!!!
 This isn't happening. It's not happening.
 Help me!
Do it! Do it!
Molly? Molly!
Sam? What's the matter? Is something wrong?
Molly!
What is it, honey?
 What is it, honey?
What's happening to me?!
Don't leave me. I need you, Sam.
Molly!
 Molly.
Don't stop! I'm not dead!
So, what happened to you?
What?
You're new, huh? I can tell.
Are you talking to me?
Relax. It ain't like before, you know. It's a whole new ball-a-wax.
Who are you?
I'm waiting for my wife. She's in 4C. Cardiac wing. She's fighting it.
 Shot, huh? That'll do it every time. Poor bastard. Well, get used to it. You could be here a long time.  I'll tell you a secret. Doors ain't as bad as you think. Zip zap. They ain't nothin' at all. You'll see. You'll catch on.
 He ain't gonna make it. I've seen it a million times. He's a goner. See? Here they come. Lucky bastard. Could have been the other ones. You never know.
Hurry, we're losing him.
What'd I tell you? Bingo!
He's gone.
Who are you? What's happening...?
 No!
Oh God, help me.
As we say farewell to our friend Sam Wheat, we are reminded of his kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy of spirit...
 All that we treasure, our friends, our loved ones, our body, our mind, are but on loan to us. We must surrender them all. We are all travelers on the same road which leads to the same end.
As our loved one enters eternal life, let us remember that love, too, is eternal, that although we will miss him, our love will light the void and dispel the darkness.
Molly.
...and into Your hands we commend his spirit. May he rest in peace. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
What time you going back to work?... What's the buzz on Digital? It's sad. He was so young... How's your new Honda?... Going away this weekend?
Oh God, Sam...
 I picked up your shirts this morning. I don't know why. Mr. Reynolds said to tell you hello. I broke into tears. It's so hard...
 I think about you every minute. It's like you're still here, like I can feel you, Sam.
I am here, Moll. I am.
Frank, what's wrong? Frank?
 Sam?
Wait, Moll. Not that one. That's my favorite...
 Molly, don't.
 Say something. Help her, Carl.
It's hard. It's very hard.
 Oh good. That's really good.
Sam's address book.
Dave Brubeck. Newport '86. Should I toss 'em?
No!
Molly, we hated that concert.
Oh, you want to save those?
Rolaids? What are you doin' Moll?
I miss him, Carl.
We all do.
Wait. Wait. Not that one.
Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I don't know how that got in there.
 Hey, Moll. Why don't you come? It's like summer outside.
No.
Just for a stroll. It'd be good to get out.
I can't do it Carl.
Molly... you're not the one who died!
Okay. Just a short walk.
Thata girl.
Hey, Molly! Wait!
"Singing bye bye, Miss American Pie. Drove my Chevy to the levy, but the levy was dry. Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye, and singing this'll be the day that I..."
You motherfucking bastard! What the hell are you doing here? What are you doing?
Molly, no! Get out!
Frank, what's wrong?
Stay off! This is mine!
Damn!
She came home. I couldn't get it. Give me a couple of days. I'll go back.
Get what? Who the hell are you? What were you doing at Molly's? What the hell's going on?
 Stay away from her!
Sorry 'bout that.
Rosa Santiago.
Please be seated.
My sister will be with us soon.
Sister Oda Mae. Grant us the gift of your all-seeing presence. Appear for us now.
Mrs. Santiago.
Buenos dias.
I understand you are hoping to contact your husband.
Si. Si.
Well, I believe he's gonna be with us today.
Oh, tsank you, tsank you.
But there's no telling about the other world. You gotta cast out all doubt. You gotta believe. Do you believe?
 Si. Si. I believe. I believe.
And remember, we don't make no promises. I can phone up there till I'm blue in the face, (she points to the ceiling) ...but it don't necessarily mean he's gonna be home. Them folks go shopping, they play bingo. It's just like here. You can't always get 'em.
Sure lady!
Okay, let's get ready then.
We got a problem here. I don't think he's in. Wait. I feel something. Did he know someone who's passed over, someone named Anna... Mary... Consuela... Maria?
Si, si! His mama. She's Maria.
Ah! I knew it. He's with his mama.
 Oh my God...
I'm afraid this is gonna be too hard. Now I got two souls I gotta contact. I don't know about that. It's difficult, you know. The pain. The effort.
I pay more. How much? How much?
Twenty dollars.
Way to go. Milk her for every penny.
Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
 Have mercy! Have mercy!
Welcome, Rosa Santiago. You are fortunate today. The channel is clear. Many spirits are gathering.
 Yeah? Where?
My husband?
 I can feel his vibration. Yes, yes, he is drawing toward us now. I can see him coming.
Julio! Julio! How is he? How does he look?
Oh, he is a very handsome man.
 Handsome?
In our Father's Kingdom we are all handsome.
 Julio!
He is standing before me. He is wearing a black suit.
A black suit? Oh yes, yes. He was buried in that.
What a crock of shit!
Who's there?
 Where are you?
 Who?
Julio! Julio!
What's going on?
Get out of here! Leave me alone!
Who are you talking to?
Keep him away!
Are you talking to me?
Do something. Help me.
I don't believe this. Hey you. My name is Sam Wheat. Can you hear me? Sam Wheat!
Stop it!
Say my name! Sam Wheat! Say it!
Talk to me, Oda Mae. Say something.
Sam Wheat!
Jesus!
Samweet?
Oda Mae! Oda Mae!
Lord, I swear, no more cheatin'. I promise, Lord. I don't want to go to hell. I'll do anything. Gimme a penance. Just make him go away.
Go away. Hell no. I'm stayin' right here!
My mama, her mama, may they rest in peace, they had de gift. Mama always said I had it, but I never did. She tol' me all about it, how it felt an' all. But now that it's happenin' I don't know what to do. You're scarin' me half to death. Please, you gotta go away, you gotta find someone else.
Someone else? Are you outta your mind?
I'm gettin' there fast. (she pushes Louise's hand) Leave me alone.
Not till you help me.
Where are you?
Where? I'm right here.
I'm standing right beside you.
 "I'm standing right beside you." (she pauses and looks up) Are you white?
What?
Oh God, I knew it. He's white. Why me?
Listen, damn it. You can help me. There's a woman, Molly Jensen. She's in terrible danger. The man who killed me broke into our apartment. He's going to go back. You've gotta warn her.
Why would she listen to me?
She has to! This man's a killer! He's got a key.
Forget it, mister. I can't.
It's just a phone call. You're all I've got. Lookit. I'm not leavin' till you help me. I don't sleep anymore, so I can sit here day and night. I don't care how long it takes. I can talk forever.
Hello.
Molly? Is this Molly speaking?
Yes.
My name is Oda Mae. I'm a spiritual reader and adviser.  I'm calling for a friend of yours. He asked me to call. This is important. You gotta believe me. Don't be afraid.
Who is this?
I got a message from Sam.
 What?
Sam Wheat. He asked me to call.
What'd I tell you.
You gotta go there.
Look, I don't care what you do to me, I'm not goin' nowhere.
"I'm Henery the Eighth I am / Henery the Eighth I am, I am / I'm gettin' married to the widow next door / She's been married seven times before / And every one was an Henery / Wouldn't take a Willie or a Sam / I'm her eighth old man I'm Henery / Henery the Eighth I am, I am / Henery the Eighth I am / Second verse same as the first / I'm Henery the Eighth I am..."
Okay! Okay! I'll go. You just shut your mouth.
I can't believe I'm doin' this. I gotta be a crazy lady goin' into the city with you. I never go there. What the hell you doin' in my life, huh? Why me?
There's nobody there.
Just wait.
No, sir. I did what I promised. I said I'd come and I'm here. I didn't say anything 'bout waitin'.
Just one more time. Please. It's a big place.
 "Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall, ninety nine bottles of beer,"
Hello, who's there?
 Don't go away. It's Oda Mae Brown. I called you last night. Your friend Sam says you gotta talk to me.
Hey you, Molly! You gotta listen to me! this is for real. Sam is here. He needs to talk to you.
 He says remember the starfish at Montego Bay? Remember the picture he took a' you in Reno?  Remember his green underwear, the pair you wrote your name on? She wrote her name on 'em?
Hey, do you mind? This here's a private conversation.
Ask her about the sweater in the closet, the one she knitted that's too big.
What about the sweater you knitted that was too big?
Four sizes.
Four sizes.
She couldn't throw it out. I saw. I was there.
You couldn't throw it out. He saw. He was there. This is for real. Hey do you hear me up there?
I hear you.
I'm not talkin' to you.
Haven't you ever heard of phones?
Kiss my behind!  Listen, I'm not gonna stand here all day.
Thank God.
Forget it. I've had enough of this.
 Molly?  I'm Oda Mae Brown. (walking over and shaking her hand) You can call me Oda.
Why should I believe you? Why should I believe any of this?
Girl, if you think I'd come down here for the fun of it, you got another think comin'. This Sam of yours... I don't know, lady. I mean, you ever hear a whole night of "Henry the Eighth I am?"
He did that? That's how he got me to go out with him.
And he cain't carry a tune.
I know. Oh God. This is all so crazy. I can't believe I'm talking to you like this. I don't believe in these things. I don't believe in life after death.
Tell her she's wrong.
He says you're wrong.
You're talking to him right now?
What? You think I'm makin' it up?
Where is he?
How should I know? It's not like I can see him. I just hear his voice.
I'm holding her hand.
He says he's holding your hand.
I'm sorry. I don't believe you. Why are you doing this to me? I don't believe a word you're saying. Sam is dead. He's dead.
I'm holding her hand.
He says he's holding your hand.
God, I love her. I love her so much.
He says he loves you... so much.
 No. He would never say that.
 Ditto. Tell her "ditto".
Ditto? What's that mean, ditto?
Sam?
To tell the truth, I don't know how I'm doin' it. In fack, confidentially, nothin' like this never happened to me before. Now, all a sudden, I can't turn it off. (she sees a photo of Sam) Is this you? Is this him?
 Hazel eyes, huh? You sound like they'd be blue.
I don't understand. Why did he come back? Why is he still here?
Cause he's stuck, that's why. He's between worlds. It happens sometimes, when their spirits get out too quick. He thinks he still has stuff t'do down here.
Come on Oda Mae, stop rambling.
Oh, oh, now he's got an attitude.
I do not have an attitude.
 We're having a discussion.  Whataya mean, you're not angry? If you weren't angry you wouldn't be raisin' your voice like that.
Goddamn it, Oda Mae!
Ah ah, baby. That does it. I don't talk to anybody who takes the Lord's name in vain.
Relax, Oda Mae.
You relax. You're the dead one. You want my help, then you apologize. Nobody talks to me like that, understand?
Jesus Christ!
 Excuse me, girl. Time for me to go.
I don't believe I'm watching this.
Damn it. All right. I apologize.
 Please, Oda Mae, I need you to tell Molly what I'm saying. You gotta tell her word for word.
Monsieur has a message for you.
Molly, you're in danger.
You can't tell her like that. And would you stop movin' all over the place? You're makin' me sick.
Say it!
He's sayin' you're in danger.
Danger?... What do you mean?
I know the man who killed me. Willie Lopez. I know where he lives.
He says he knows the man who killed him, Willie Lopez. He's Puerto Rican.
Write it down.
Write it down.
You do it!
Now I'm a secretary.
321 Prospect Place. Apartment 4D.
321? Hey, that's my neighborhood.
Molly, he's got my wallet and my key. He was in here.
He's got his wallet and key. He was in here.
In here?
 You have to go to the police. The Mugger wasn't acting alone. It was a setup, Moll. I was murdered.
He says he was set up, that he was murdered. He wants you to go to the police.
 I'm sorry. I don't want nothin' to do with this.
Where you going?
Don't follow me! I've done all I'm gonna do.  I'm finished. And I ain't comin' back. So don't you come botherin' me again cause it's over. I mean it. This is it. Have a nice life. Have a nice death. I'm goin'.
Molly, there's no one on earth who'd like it to be true more than me, but you've got to be rational about this. I understand your desire to hold on to him, but this... this is absurd.
It was real, Carl. She was real.
Listen to her, Carl, goddamn it. She needs some support here.
Molly, you're a grown woman. How can you believe some fortune teller from Brooklyn...?
She was in touch with him.
I don't believe it, Molly. Not for a minute.
Come on, Carl. Open your mind.
Carl, she knew things.
What kind of things?
I told you, the picture in Reno, the starfish,... damn it, Carl.  She said Sam knew who killed him. That he was set up... murdered.
Oh boy. This is getting deranged. We're going off the deep end here.
Give him the address, Moll.
She had a name, an address -- Willie Lopez, 321 Prospect Place. She said he had Sam's wallet.
This is sick. This is really sick. How can you swallow this crap? Who knows if this guy exists? Maybe she's just setting someone up.
That's what I have to find out.
Find out? What are you talking about?
Sam wants me to go to the police.
Sam wants you to go to the police? Molly! Jesus! Are you outta your mind? What are you gonna tell 'em? Some storefront psychic's been getting messages from the dead? Do you know how that sounds? You're talkin' ghosts here, for God's sake.
 I'm sorry. This stuff just really gets to me.
You don't believe me. You don't believe any of this, do you?
 I'm trying to, but... Look, if it'll make you sleep any better, I'll check it out, okay? Now why don't you go to bed. Try and get some sleep.
Way to go, Carl!
Carl, what're you doin' here?
 Who've you been talking to?
Talking to? What the hell do you mean? What's going on?
Some woman knows all about you. The murder, everything. Where's she getting it from, huh?
What the hell are you talking about? I haven't said a word.
She knows your name, goddamn it! She knows where you live!
A lot of women know where I live.
This isn't a joke, man. You find that bitch, whoever she is, and... get rid of her, you hear me? I've got four million dollars stuck in that fucking computer. If I don't get those codes, if that money's not transferred soon, I'm dead. If I lose Balistrari's money, we're both dead.
Tell him you only wash dirty money on the first of the month.
What is wrong with you? Is everything a joke? You were supposed to steal his wallet. You weren't supposed to kill him. Was that a joke?
 I did you a favor. Freebee.
Jesus!  These are drug dealers, man.  Don't blow this for me, Willie. I've risked my job here. I could go to jail. A hundred thousand of that money goes to me. Now give me Sam's key. I'll get that address book myself.
You killed me, Carl. You had me killed. Look what you've done to me! Look what you've done!
You fucker! You mother fucker! I had a life, Goddamn you. I had a life!
You white fascist bigot. Who do you think you are? Bed Stuy's part of New York, you know. This is America.
Hey, Snow, you lost or sumpin'?
Look, you've gotta believe me. I don't even believe this stuff, myself. But this is real. Do you think I'd come here if it wasn't real? You told me to come if I had any new information. Well, here I am.
 Don't look at me like that. You guys use psychics all the time.
 Damn it. I know how this sounds. I hear myself saying it and I want to cringe. But this woman knew things she couldn't have known, intimate details.
How intimate?
Things Sam only said to me.
 Okay, let me get this straight. According to this psychic lady, there are ghosts and spirits all over the place, watching us all the time, huh?...  I'm sorry. I've got important things to do.
I'm telling you. The killer's name is Willie Lopez. I've got his address. You've got to check it out.
Okay. You just wait here. Let me see if this guy's got a record.
What are you doing? Where's your file on Willie Lopez?
There's no file for a Willie Lopez. He was probably some old boyfriend she was trying to get even with. This psychic woman's record goes back a long way. Fraud, numbers rackets, you name it. She's a real pro.
 1967. Shreveport, Louisiana. Forgery, selling false ID. Served one year. 1971. Baton Rouge. Arrested for fraud, numbers racketeering. Served ten months. 1974. Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Fraud, seven months. 1984. Albany, New York. Petty larceny. It goes on and on.
 This woman's a charlatan. You can't believe anything she said.
This isn't possible. There were words, private things. How could she have known all that?
They have ways.
Ways? What ways?
They've got a million cons. A lot of times they read the obits. All she had to do was see the word "banker". Hell, they even go through your garbage to find things they can use, letters, old papers. They don't need much.
 I bet you threw stuff out, huh? It could have been anything. What about that underwear she knew all about?
 Green underwear. I'll bet she zeroed right in on that.
No! She was real. She said things. She knew about a sweater I knitted, about songs we sang... She knew about this place we went, Montego Bay...
I'm sorry. I know this is hard. People want so much to believe. They're grieving, vulnerable. They'd give anything for one last moment... money, insurance policies. Believe me, these people know what they're doing. Look, I know how you must feel. You know, you can press charges.
Oh God, I wanted it to be Sam.
 God, let this be it!
 Oh God, yes!
 Tony, this is Carl. I'm all set. We're fine. Everything's fine. Just tell me what you want me to do.
We want you to transfer the money from the 12 separate accounts into a single account under the name "Rita Miller". Tomorrow, at five minutes before closing, 3:55 p. m., transfer the full account to First Island Bank of Nassau, registry number 486- 9580.
 Call us when it's done.
Tell Mr. Balistrari there won't be any problems.
I'll do that.
Why can't you hear me, Molly? I need you.
Who's there?
Molly, it's Carl. Can I come up?
Don't open it. He's a murderer, Moll!
Hi. Thanks. I know it's late. I'm sorry to disturb you. I felt bad about last night. This supernatural stuff just makes me so uncomfortable. I don't even read horoscopes.
Don't worry. It's okay.
No it's not. You needed me to hear you and I didn't and that was wrong. I want you to know that I'm your friend, Moll.
You were never our friend.
 Hey, I brought you some Japanese apple pears. I know you like them.
 Oh, that's so sweet.
Listen, can I come in for a minute? I won't stay long. I've had one of those days. Maybe a cup of coffee?
No, Moll. Don't do it. Don't let him in!
 Sure.
Are you alright? You look nervous, upset.
 What can I tell you. It's been tough. Hell, you know. It still hurts so much.  Then on top of it all... it's the responsibilities. They've given me my own accounts, but I've had no time to adjust. My mind has been reeling.
 Where were you this morning? I thought you were coming to the bank to sign those papers.
I didn't have time.  I went to the police, Carl.
You're kidding. You really did it? I don't believe... What did you tell them? What did they say?
You were right, you know. I felt like such a fool. They brought out a file on this psychic woman ten inches thick. It was awful.
 A ripoff artist, huh?
 Molly, no.
The sad part is that I believed her. I believed her, Carl.  It was all a sham.
 Sometimes we need to believe.
Why?... I was a fool. I don't believe anything anymore. Why would people do such things?
 It's hard to face reality, Moll, the hard cold facts of it. What you have to remember is the love you felt. That's what's real. You have to remember how good Sam was. How much he loved you.
 You were everything to him, Molly. You were his life.
 I feel so alone.
You're not alone. You're young. You've got so much talent. You're fantastically gorgeous.
 Oh God, I don't know what's real anymore. I don't know what to think.
Just think about Sam. Think about what he meant to you, the years you had together, how wonderful they were.
 Let your feelings out.
 Life turns on a dime, Moll. People think they have forever, that they'll always have tomorrow. But it's not true. Sam taught us that. We have to live for now, for today.
No!!!
I can't. I'm sorry. I can't. It's too soon... You've been great Carl, but... I need you to leave. Please. I need you to.
Sure. It's okay. I understand. I really do.
 Look, what if we have dinner tomorrow night? Just talk. Can I interest you in that?
NO!!!
Get off my train!
Teach me how you do that! I want to learn! I'm not leaving til you teach me!
You stubborn asshole.
 What are you doing? What are you doing? You can't push it with your finger. You're dead.
I don't get it.
It's your mind, you idiot. It's all in the mind. The problem is you think you're still real, that you're standin' on the floor, that you're wearin' those clothes. Bullshit! You don't even have a body anymore. It's all up here. You wanna move things, you gotta use your mind. You gotta focus! You hear what I'm saying?
How do you focus?
I don't know how you focus! You just focus!
 It's all in the anger. You gotta direct it. You gotta channel it.
I'm angry all the time. It doesn't do a thing.
Cause you're angry all over. You gotta be angry here, in the pit of your stomach. Bring it down here. Let it explode. (he makes an explosive gesture) It's like a reactor, you know. Pow!
I did it!
Way to go.
From your gut. What do I keep tellin' you?
 Give it time! What else have you got?
How long have you been here?
Since they pushed me.
Someone pushed you?
Yeah, someone pushed me!
Who?
What? You don't believe me? You think I fell? You think I jumped? Well, fuck you! (an unexpected rage starts to build) It wasn't my time! I wasn't supposed to go! I'm not supposed to be here!
 I'd give everything for a drag. Just one drag.
 Who the hell are you? Why are you hounding me like this? Leave me alone.
What the hell?
Sam?
What is all this? What's goin' on?
What'd you do, tell every spook in town about me? I got spooks from out of town here. There's stuff goin' on you wouldn't believe. I can't hardly believe it myself.
Oda Mae. You're doing it. This is for real. How do you like that?
I don't.
Come on. Look at this. You're doing great.
Can you hurry this up? My husband's in the waiting room.
I need your help, Oda Mae. There's something we need to do.
Forget it. I'm not doin' anything. You're holdin' on to a life that don't want you no more. Give it up.
Give it up? I'm already dead.
Dead, yeah, but you ain't finished dyin'. Give up the ghost.
And how am I supposed to do that?
You're asking me?
Are you speaking to me?
Does it look like I'm speakin' to you?  So, are you gonna leave or not? I've got work to do.
 What's a matter? You're supposed to be concentrating. How do you expect me to do this if you're not concentrating? Okay then. You ready? Let's do it.
Oh, Lord! Stop! Whatcha doin' to me?
 Ortisha?!
 Orlando! Is that you?
 Ortisha, where are you? I can't see too good.
Here! She's here!
In front of you! I'm right here!
Mother of God, what've you done to your hair!?
Orlando, do you like it? It's Autumn Sunrise.
Get out of here, you little shit!
 Lord oh Lord, don't you ever do that to me!
 Orlando!?
What happened to me? I can barely move.
You should know better than to try that. It's not worth it. It'll wipe you out for days.
That was incredible, Oda Mae.
Never again. Never.
Where's Orlando?
He spoke through you. It was amazing.
No more, uh uh, no more.
What happened to Orlando? Where'd he leave the insurance policy?
You're great, Oda Mae! You're a real medium. It's what you were born for.
I want everybody out.
Orlando?
Now!
Oda Mae, what's wrong?
Out! I said out! That means you, too!
Oda Mae, there's a man here who says he has to see you right away.
I ain't seein' nobody.
Are you the one that can talk to the dead?
I beg your pardon! I'm not seeing customers right now.
I said I need to know if you're the one.
I'm the one. But not now.
This is important. I have a friend. He died recently. Some say he was mugged. I think he was murdered.
 I'm told you can contact people like that. Is that true?
It's been known to happen. But it's not gonna happen now, so come back later.
I can't wait til later.
What's your friend's name?
Good question. Why don't you tell me?
 You're the psychic, right?
This ain't no guessin' game.
Then what is it, lady?
Lookit, I don't know what your trouble is...  Who are you?
You're the mindreader. I hear you've been tellin' people about me for days. What's my name?
Willie!
Willie!?
How'd you know that?
Because I'm psychic.
He tried to kill me! Why? Why?
 Talk to me!
Oda Mae, we're in trouble...
We're in trouble? Who's we? You're already dead.
I can stop them. But I can't do it alone. You've gotta help me.
Help you? It's me they're tryin' to kill.
You're right. And they'll be back. I'm your only chance.
Why don't you go find a haunted house and rattle some chains.
I need you Oda Mae. I need you to get some fake ID's.
Fake ID's? What for?
Help me now, they'll never bother you again. I promise.
 Help you? Whataya talking about exactly? What else do I have to do?
This is crazy. This ain't gonna work. I don't know nothin' 'bout bankin'.
I'll teach you. You'll learn fast.
See where it says "New Accounts"? That's where you're going.
 I'm not givin' 'em any money.
Just do what I say.
Can I help you?
Tell her you're here to fill out a signature card for a new account.
I'm here to fill out a signature card for a new account.
And do you know your account number?
Yes. 926-31043.
Yes. 926-31043.
Rita Miller.
Who?
What?
Tell her Rita Miller.
Rita Miller.
 Didn't they have you sign a card when you opened the account?
Tell her Carl Bruner opened it for you by phone and asked you to come in today.
Carl Bruner opened it for me. He asked me to come in today.
Ah.
Just sign you name at the bottom on the first blank line.
 No, no, no. Rita Miller.
 Can I have another one please? I signed the wrong name.
Tell her to see that it goes right up to the third floor file since you have a transaction to make.
I need you to put that in the third floor file cause I got a transfusion to make.
A what?
You know what I mean.  Umm, can I keep the pen?
 ...uh, sure.
Thanks.
Hello. Carl Bruner speaking.
Carl?
Mr. Balsitrari
Balistrari? Carl, it's me, John. I've got the info on the Bradley portfolio.
Oh yeah, yeah. That's great. I'll pick it up later.
Tell the guard you're here to see Lyle Furgeson.
Lyle Furgeson, please.
Do you have an appointment?
No. I'm here for the fun of it.
Don't say that! Tell him Rita Miller's here.
Tell him Rita Miller's here.
Just one moment, please.
Don't embellish.
Yes, Sir.
 Excuse me?
 Now listen, this guy Furgeson's a real jerk.
Why are you whispering?
 Just be quiet and listen. I've known him five years and he still thinks my name's Paul.
 He's a social moron. You don't have to worry about anything. Tell the guard Furgeson knows you. You spent time with him and his wife Shirley at the Brewster's Christmas party last year.
What is this regarding?
What? He doesn't remember me? We were together at the Brewster's Christmas party. With his wife Shirley. They had that lovely tree... all those presents. Why, I'll never forget all those beautiful...
 Oops. Gas.
This'll be easy. Furgeson was so drunk at that party, he could have had a conversation with Tina Turner and he wouldn't remember.
Hello, hello. Of course, of course. It's been so long.
A long time.
Ask how Bobby and Snooky are.
How are Bobby and Snooky doin'?
 Why, they're just fine, thank you. Nice of you to ask. And how is your... family?
Couldn't be better.
Well, isn't that wonderful.
Tell him you've been wondering how they did on the Gibraltar securities.
So tell me, Fergie, how did you do on the Gibraltar securities?
 The Gibraltar securities! Well, it looks like we topped out, huh?
"We sure did!"
We sure did.
 That was a wonderful tip.
"Good old Randy".
Good old Randy. Got a real head on his shoulders.
"Her" shoulders.
"Her" shoulders.
Sure does. Well... well. So what brings you here today?
You're closing an account.
I'm closing an account.
Well... wonderful. Do you have your account number?
926-31043.
926-3143.
31-0-43.
Make that 31-0-43... Numbers. I'm dyslexic.
 Well, Rita, you'll be withdrawing four million dollars from us today, is that correct?
Four million dollars?!
Say "yes"!
 Yes! Four million. That's right. That's right.
And how will you want that?
Tens and twenties?
Pardon?
A cashier's check! Tell him a cashier's check.
A cashier's check.
Fine. Of course, you realize we're required to get some identification from everyone. It's just procedural. You understand.
Of course.
You know, if you put that Brillo pad in the freezer, it'll last twice as long.
Yes, Mr. Bruner.
Get me the First Island Bank of Nassau. It's on the rolodex.
I'll just need your signature right here.
Sure.
Sign Rita Miller.
 I'll be back in a minute. You're on your own. Don't say anything foolish.
Now you be careful with this. It's like carrying cash, you know.
 I sure do.
 Then my mother took all the money from the oil wells and put it in gasoline pumps. Every gas station has 'em you know, sometimes six or more. It adds up.
Oda Mae, come on. We gotta get out of here. Say goodbye.
 Well, I've got to leave. It's been a pleasure doin' business with you. Say "hi" to Shirley and Snooky for me.
Thank you, Rita. I'll be glad to.
Hurry up, Oda Mae.
 What a day!
Lionel?
Molly. How are you?
Lionel, a woman who just left, a black lady, about my height, did you see her?
Well, yes. I just took care of her.
What did she want? Did it have anything to do with me? Did she ask about Sam?
 Sam? No. Why?
Was her name Oda Mae Brown?
No, Rita Miller. She just closed an account.
 Is there a problem?
 No. I guess not. Thanks.
Carl, is something wrong?
Is someone playing with the computers?
What?
Is this a joke? One of my accounts is closed.
Which account? What's wrong?
 You want me to call someone?
 No, no. Never mind. It's okay. It's all right. I can do it.
$4,000,000. $4,000,000. Lord Almighty.
Oda Mae. Take the check out of your purse.
Take it out? Why?
Just do it.
 Now endorse it. Sign Rita Miller.
 Endorse it? Why?
Do what I say.
No!
That's blood money, Oda. I was killed for that money. Endorse it now.
What are you going to do with it?
We're giving it away.
Away? What do you mean? To who?
Look to your left.
Are you outta your mind?
Do what I tell you.
No!  I can't.
Yes, you can. If you don't do it, they'll track you down. Your only protection is to get rid of it, now.
Sweet Jesus, you're killing me, Sam.
I'm saving you, Oda Mae. You'll go to heaven for this.
Write "St. Joseph's Shelter".
Bless you, child.
I'm proud of you.
Don't you talk to me. I don't want you comin' round no more. I mean it. Understand?
Come on, we're friends.
Friends? Friends?
I think you're wonderful, Oda Mae.
Search, you bastard! You'll never find it. It's gone.  They'll kill you for this, Carl. You and Willie. They'll wipe you off the face of the earth.
What the...?
 Who's doing that?
You bastard! You goddamn bastard!
Ah!
It's dinner time, Carl. Don't you have a date with Molly, you creepy son-of-a bitch?
Jesus! Oh God!
Carl? Where were you? I thought we were having...?
I'm sorry. Things just got so crazy. I completely forgot.
Old Carl had a little trouble at the office.
Forgot? I was worried. Is everything okay? Are you all right?
I'm okay. I'm alright. Look, can I talk to you for minute? Can I come in?
 I need to ask you a question.
He needs to borrow four million dollars.
Molly, I know what the police said, but when you thought Sam was here, when you thought he spoke to you, what did you feel? What did he say?
Why? What happened?
 Molly, that psychic woman, I want to know what she told you. I want to know what she said.
Carl, stop this. It was all a hoax. I told you. It wasn't real. She's a charlatan. (she hesitates and stares at Carl) Does this have anything to do with her being at the bank today?
Oh shit!
 At the bank?
I was sure I saw her. Furgeson says she was taking out money. It turns out her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown. It's Rita Miller or something.
 What's wrong?
Stomach. My stomach. Do you have anything? Pepto Bismol.
 Sure. Just a second. What's going on?
What are you doing to me. Get away! Get away!
You touch me again and I'll set her on fire. I mean it. I'll kill her. I'll blow up the whole building if I have to. Stay away!
 Go on, try it again. Let me see you turn it off now.
 Try and hurt me. I'll kill her if you hurt me.
What's a matter? You believe me, huh? You better believe me! I want my money. I need that money and I want it tonight -- at 11:00. If that psychic lady doesn't bring it here, Molly's dead.
Oh my God. Is that the gas?
You must have left the stove on.
 Just glad I smelled it.
 Me, too.
Molly, I'm sorry. I've got to go. Look, there's something going on. I can't talk now. Some trouble at the bank.
Trouble? What kind of trouble? Is it that woman, the psychic?
I don't have time to talk now. What if I come back? Around 11:00?
Carl, what's going on? Let me help you.
I can't. I'm sorry to do this, but it's important. I'll be back.
 Eleven!
Sam!
Not again!
What're you doin' here?
Oda Mae! We're in trouble. They want the check. They're comin' to kill you. We gotta get outta here.
The check? What do you mean, "the check". You said they'd never find out.
 What's happenin' Oda Mae?
It's them.
They're comin' to kill me.  What have you done?
They're heading for the door.
 Jesus have mercy.
Emergency! Let us in!
Who you kiddin'?
What're you doin'? You can't come in here. The cat don't like visitors. She'll pee all over the couch. You wanna pay for...
They're gonna find us.
No they won't. I'm gonna get 'em.
Oh yeah? And how you gonna do that?
Whataya mean? I'm a ghost, aren't I?
Looks like someone just left.
I'll check the building.
Damn!
 Who's there? Who's doing that?
Oh God!
 Let me outta here!
Help me!
Look out!
Sam? What happened?
He's dead, Oda Mae.
Dead! (she utters a sigh of relief) Oh, thank God. It's over.
No. It's not over, Oda Mae. There's still Carl.
Who's Carl?
Tell him to hurry!
Can't you hurry up?
Listen, lady, I'm going as fast as I can.
Problems?
Carl, is that you?
Molly, it's Oda Mae. I know what you think of me, but your life is in danger. You have to listen to me. Sam's here, too. You gotta let us in.
Get the hell out of here. I'm calling the police.
Go ahead. We want you to call 'em. You're in trouble. Let us in.
No!
Sam's death was no accident. He was murdered, Molly. Carl was laundering money at the bank. Sam found out. He's dangerous. He tried to kill me. He'll kill you, too.
 Why are you doing this to me? Get away from me! I know all about you. You're a fake. You're just a fake. Leave me alone!
Tell her she's wearing the blouse I spilled the Margarita on and the earrings I gave her for Christmas.
Sam says you're wearin' the blouse he spilled the Margarita on and the earrings he gave you at Christmas.
 See, I'm no fake.
Go away!
Gimme a penny quick.
What?
Empty your purse. On the floor. Now.
 Push a penny under the door.
 Tell her it's for luck.
Sam says it's for luck.
Right. Yes, it's right on the corner. We're a red brick building with the entrance on the left side. Please hurry. Thank you Sergeant. We'll be waiting right here.  Police are on their way.
What do we do now?
Just wait.
Is Sam here?
I'm sitting beside you.
 Right here.
 Can you feel me, Sam?
With all my heart.
With all his heart, he says.
I'd give anything to be alive again, just to feel you once more.
He wishes he could touch you, just one more time.
Oh, Sam.
Okay, damn it, you can use me if you want.
 Come on. Before I change my mind.
Sam!
I love you so much.
The police!
No!
 Wait!
What's happening to me?
Molly, open up. It's me.
It's Carl!
Get out of here! The fire escape.
Come with me.
Molly. Open up. Are you there?
Molly!
Back to the fire escape. Head for the roof.
This way!
Help us, Sam!
I want the check. Just give me the check.
 God almighty, Carl! What are you doing? What have you done!?
Don't interfere! She's a thief. It's not her money.
 Keep out of this, Molly!
 Where is it?
In my purse.
Where?
Over there.
Where is it, goddamn it? Where is it?
I gave it away.
You're lying! Don't lie to me!
 I'll kill her. You touch me and I'll kill her. I mean it, Sam. Just give me the check.
 Sam, please. I didn't mean for him to kill you. It's not my fault. Come on, Sam, give me the check. Give it to me and I'll leave her alone.
Sam? Sam?
Sam?
Goodbye, Moll.
Sam? Is that you?
 Molly?!
I hear you, Sam.
 Oh God!
I can't stay anymore.
They're waiting for you, Sam.
 I know. Goodbye, Oda Mae. (with deep felt gratitude) Thank you. Your mama would be proud.
I love you, Molly. I've always loved you.
Ditto.
It's so amazing, Moll...
 The love inside.
 You take it with you.
See ya.
