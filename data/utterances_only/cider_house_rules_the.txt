In other parts of the world, young men of promise leave home to make their fortunes, battle evil, or solve the problems of the world.
I was myself such a young man, when I came to save the orphanage in St. Cloud's... many years ago.
Here in St. Cloud's, I have come to understand that promises are rarely kept, that the battle isn't so much against evil as ignorance, and that being successful can't hold a candle to being of *use*.
Nor have I solved the problem I came here to solve.
Even in the most enlightened times, unwanted babies will manage to be born. That there will always be orphans is simple not a problem to be solved. Here is St. Cloud's, we don't regard the sordid facts of life as problems.
In truth, we've only had one real problem.
His name was Homer Wells.
I named him after the Greek writer. You know Homer, of course?
I made his name "Wells" because I could tell he was very deep.
In truth, Nurse Angela named him-- her father *drilled* wells, and "Homer" was one of her family's umpteen cats.
"Good night, you Princes of Maine, you Kings of New England!"
There's something wrong with him! He never makes a sound.
He didn't cry enough for them, if you can believe it.
Do you think we could have a look at someone a little different?
Thus was Homer Wells returned. He was too happy a baby.
The second family has an unfortunate gift for getting sounds out of Homer.
The rumor was true. They beat him. He couldn't stop crying.
Here is St. Cloud's, I try to consider, with each rule I make or break, that my first priority is an orphan's future.
Easier said than done.
I told the third family to take good care--this was a special boy.
It was Homer who took too much good care of himself.
Don't be frightened. Everyone is nice here.
Do you live here?
I just belong here.
What could I do with him? He kept coming back!
Homer, if you're going to stay at St. Cloud's, I expect you to be of use.
But, in failing to withhold love, had I created a true and everlasting orphan? I had been too successful with Homer Wells. I had managed to make the orphanage his *home*.
God forgive me. I have *made* an orphan by loving him too much. Homer Wells will belong to St. Cloud's, forever.
Dr. Larch! Dr. Larch!
We've got two new patients, one to deliver.
First pregnancy?
Yes, for both.
 I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
 All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.
 Have you ever had ether, Dorothy?
Once, when they took out my appendix.
 No one's touched your appendix.
Whatever it was... the ether made me sick.
It won't make you sick this time, Dorothy--not the way I do it, just a drop at a time.
I can't pay for this, you know--I got no money.
One day, Dorothy, if you have any money, a donation to the orphanage would be very much appreciated.
Only if you can afford it.
 Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
That was good, Carla--that was *perfect*. Everything's fine.
I don't wanna see it!
You don't have to see it, dear. Don't worry.
I don't even wanna know what sex it is--don't tell me!
We won't tell you, Carla. You're going to be okay.
Your *baby's* going to be okay, too.
I don't wanna know!
He's a big boy!
Let me see him, for Christ's sake--I wanna see him.
Would you mind having a look at Dorothy?
There was no visible wound?
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
 It looks like scurvy.
 Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
She's a prostitute, isn't she?
 Did you look in her purse?
 I looked everywhere else!
It's called French Lunar Solution.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
It's obviously an aborticide.
Obviously.
 Christ, it's oil of tansy!
I don't know it.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
In other words, scurvy.
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
Take care of that, will you?
I'll help you.
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
I'm *not* a doctor!
I'm sorry, Homer.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
I haven't read that.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." Would you?
What is it, Mary Agnes?
 Look!
Did you bite it?
I don't remember.
 It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
 No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
Story time, Fuzzy!
"Oh Lord, support us all the day long..."
"...until the shadows lengthen and the evening comes, and the busy world is hushed, and the fever of life is over, and our work is done."
"Then in Thy mercy grant us save lodging, and holy rest, and peace at the last."
"A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring, jumped for the dead man's shoulders."
"Missing his aim, he fell into a ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a stone, dashed his brains out.
Good night, you Princes of Maine! You Kings of New England!
 Why does Dr. Larch *do* tht every night?
 Maybe to scare us...
 No, you jerk.
 Dr. Larch *loves* us!
But why does he do *that*?
He does it because we like it.
Buster is mine. You two get Copperfield and Curly. Nobody touches Fuzzy.
Stop it! No fighting! *Share* the snowballs!
 They're *our* snowballs! They *stole* them!
They attacked us--just like the Japs!
Listen to you, Fuzzy! You've been running. You get to the shower!
I know the type--they'll take one of the babies.
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
 Life is waiting.
Where's the name sheet?
Nobody's named this one yet.
It's my turn!
Henceforth you shall be... Little Dorrit!
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I don't think so.
You do it then.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
They picked Hazel! The idiots chose Hazel!
If people want to adopt one of us, they should have to take the oldest first.
Please, Mary Agnes! This is Hazel's special day--don't make her feel sad.
Hazel's practically the youngest of us. She should be the *last* to leave!
At least Hazel can talk. Usually they take one of the stupid babies.
They take the babies so they won't ever have to tell them that they were orphans!
 I'm not a baby!
If you cry, Hazel, they'll just send you back.
Mary Agnes, that's not true!
That's what they did to me!
You *wanted* to come back--that's why you cried.  You can cry if you feel like it, Hazel. You cry as much as you want.
It is strictly for our orphans' sake that I destroy any record of their natural mothers. Of course they will, one day, want to know. But orphans, especially, should look forward to their *futures*. Not back to their pasts.
Hi, Curly. You going somewhere?
I thought they might take me.
They wanted a girl.
Nobody ever wants me!
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
That's true.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Nobody special enough, Curly.
You mean somebody asked?
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
Let us be happy for Hazel. Hazel has found a family. Good night, Hazel.
Good night, Hazel! Good night, Hazel! Good night, Hazel!
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
You weren't dreaming about me.
I was!
Then I wasn't beautiful.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
Are you okay? Can I get you anything?
No one but me ever put a hand on me, to feel that baby. Don't you want to touch it or put your ear down to it?
Okay.
Put your ear there. Go on.
You shouldn't have a baby if there's no one who wants to put his face right there!
Stay right there. Right where you are. Stay right here. Right here.
Do you ever think about leaving this place to go find them?
I mean your parents.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
Why not?
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
You cook very well!
And that I can drive a truck!
 Better than I can!
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
I know.
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
I doubt it. She's just an...
...emotional girl.
What's she so emotional about?
 I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
 He thinks she's his *mother*!
He doesn't think she's his mother, Fuzzy.
He does so! He *loves* her!
How could she be his *mother*?
 They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
 They just want you to hire some new help.
Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
Homer! I need you!
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
 It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
Angela, we need a new movie, a new projector, a new typewriter--*that's* what they should replace around here!
We have a delivery. Imminent, in my estimation...
Homer, would you get this one?
She's a patient, right? She should see a doctor.
 Homer, you are a skilled and gifted surgeon. You have near-prefect obstetrical and gynecological procedure.
I just mean I'd rather fix the movie. Tonight.
Sure. Okay. You splice. I'll deliver.
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
That's why Kong loves her!
I thought it was my turn.
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
 "Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show."
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
 His father's dead, right?
 That's right, Fuzz.
 "There is something strange to me, even now, in the reflection that he never saw me..."
Is *your* father dead?
 Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Liver* killed him?
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
But did you know him?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Did you know your mother better?
 She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
What's a nanny do?
She looks after other people's children.
Did you grow up around here?
No. She was an immigrant.
What's an immigrant?
Someone not from Maine.
No one's going to hurt you, dear. Have you come to visit us? We have beds, you know. Have you had any breakfast? What's your name?
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
 How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
Twelve? Are you twelve, dear?  You have to tell me how long you've been pregnant.  Three months?
Are you *four* months pregnant?
 She's at least *five*.
Dear child, it won't hurt when I look. I'm just going to *look*.
Tell me: you haven't done something to yourself, have you?
It wasn't me!
Did you go to someone else?
He said he was a doctor. I would never have stuck that inside me!
Stuck *what* inside you?
It wasn't me! I would never do no such thing! I wouldn't stick that inside me! It wasn't me!
 Listen, you've been very brave. I'm going to put you to sleep--you won't feel it anymore. You've been brave enough.
That's a heavy sedation.
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
 If she'd come to you four months ago and asked you for a simple D and C, what would you have decided to do? *Nothing*? *This* is what doing nothing gets you, Homer. It means that someone else is going to do the job--some moron who doesn't know *how*!
I wish you'd come to *me*, dear child. You should have come to me, instead.
What'd she die of?
 She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
 If you expect people to be responsible for their children, you have to give them the right to decide whether or not to *have* children. Wouldn't you agree?
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
I didn't mean her. I'm talking about... adults.  You know who I mean!
What?!
 It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
I'm happy I amuse you.
 Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. (Buster considers this)
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
Happy to be alive... I guess so.
So many children. Are they all orphans?
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
Oh, they're getting into the car... watch your fingers!
I'm the best.
 You are?
 The best? Wow! The best at *what*?
I'm the best one.
Here, blow...
I really *am* the best, I just have a cold.
Blow! There, I bet that feels better.
 Yeah.
Curly, come here!
 *Tell* them! I'm the one.
 I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
It's okay--I don't mind.
We brought some chocolates for the kids.
 Chocolates. How *thoughtful*.
I'm the best! *Tell* them!
You're the best, Curly.
So, Mrs...
Candy. Candy Kendall.
Wally. Wally Worthington.
 How many months are you?
 Two.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
 Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
Excuse me, Homer. Dr. Larch said this one is your turn.
Oh, dear--I'm sorry. I meant the circumcision. That boy you delivered on Tuesday...
Sure. Fine. Have you prepped him?
I'll get started.
I think it was the ether--the smell got to me.  God. This is all my fault.
 Steerforth got into the pantry--he's eaten all the pie dough.
 He wasn't sharing it, either.
He's down the hall, throwing up.
What kind of plane are you flying?
A B-24 Liberator.
Liberator...
Have you enlisted?
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Really! Is it serious?
No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
Oh, well. I don't imagine there's any strain or stress around *here*!
How is she doing?
Just fine.
 Boy or girl?
It was nothing--it's all over.
It's all over, honey.
 I would like to have a baby, one day. I really would.
Why, of course--you can have as many children as you want. I'm sure you'll have very beautiful children.
You'll have Princes of Maine! You'll have Kings of New England!
I suggest you find yourself some fresh air, Lieutenant.
Homer, when is Halloween?
 Uh... it's the end of October.
Is that soon?
That's a few months away, Fuzz.  I still don't feel so good.
 Oh. It's the best time! How come we only get pumpkins once a year?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
 I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
 Where are you going?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
Cape Kenneth...
That sounds fine.
 Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
 I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
 Of course.
 Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
 You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
 I don't need your gratitude.
 I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
Going where? Does he have a plan of some kind?
Will he be back soon?
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
 He's leaving...
He'll need clothes... some money...
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
 Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
 He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
 I think these will fit you.
You'll need some money--just a little something, until you find a job.
 I'm okay--I can walk.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
 Coming with us? It's always a good idea to have a doctor along for the ride.
I have to go, Curly. I'm sorry.  I couldn't find Buster. Will you tell him...
Let us be happy for Homer Wells...
Homer Wells has found a family. Good night, Homer!
Actually, the Army has given me leave twice. First when my father died, and now I'm on leave to help my mother-- I'm just trying to get her ready for the harvest. She's no farmer. Apples were my dad's business. And with the war on, she's short on pickers.
 Wally thinks apples are boring.
 I never said they were boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Well, they aren't.
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
There! You said it was boring.
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
Is your family in the apple business, too?
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
I've never seen a lobster.
Really?
I've never seen the ocean, either.
 You've never seen the *ocean*?
That's not funny... that's *serious*.
I couldn't have a baby with someone who's leaving me--I didn't know what else to do!
I know.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Where's Mandalay?
Burma!
Oh...
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
I understand.
Honey, honey... of course I'll come back.
You don't *know*, Wally. You have no *idea*!
Stay away from me!
 This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
It's all very normal.
You ought to cut that shit out--it's terrible for you.
I'm a little worried about the... (she gestures below her waist) ...about how much bleeding is okay.
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
Catch!
 Give it here!
What was *that*?! Come over here!
It's called the Burma run. It's about a seven-hour round-trip flight between India and China.
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
At what altitude?
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
 Actually, I volunteered.
It's the flying, right? You love to fly, don't you?
I love the bombing, too. But there's also the Himalayas--they have the most wicked air currents in the world. I wouldn't miss flying there for anything.
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
Sure... I'll see you around.
 I love you, Wally.
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
Come on. You have to meet my mom.  If it comes up, I've been at a wedding. That's where I met you, at the wedding.
Wally? I expected you earlier...
This is Homer Wells--he's the most overqualified apple picker you'll ever meet, but he's dying to learn the apple business.
How do you do, Homer Wells...
How do you do...
Were you a friend of the bride or the groom?
Homer is everybody's friend, Mom... the bride's, the groom's, mine, Candy's, *everybody's*.
Well, perhaps you'll come to dinner, Homer...
Not tonight, Mom--he's got to meet *Mr. Rose*!
You already used up the hot water!
You're usin' my soap, ain't you?
I ain't usin' no soap--it's too cold to bother with soap!
There ain't never enough hot water, soap or no soap.
They're migrants.
 Migrants?
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons. (leaning close to Homer) The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
That sink's backed up again, Wally. I thought you was gonna get me a plumber.
Rose, this is Homer--Homer, this is Mr. Rose's daughter, Rose.
Rose Rose?
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
No, no--Homer is a new *picker*. He's going to stay here with you.
 He's stayin' *here*?
That daughter of mine sure is Miss Hospitality, ain't she, Wally?
You got lots of experience pickin', I suppose.
Homer's got no experience, Arthur, but he's smarter then I am. He's a fast learner.
This is history. Ain't that what you're sayin', Wally? I guess we makin' *history*... havin' this young man stay with us!
 See you later.
So. What should I do now?
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
If you're as smart as Wally says, you know you sometimes gotta do one job before you do another.
You did a good job with that shed, Homer.
What kind of a name is Homer?
It's the name of a cat. Originally. Well, not *originally*.
Now, now--we all got names, sensible or not.  Peaches is from Georgia, where we met him pickin' peaches. He's still better with peaches than hs is with apples.  Jack here is new. And this here is Hero, 'cause he was a hero of some kind or other once. Ain't that right, Hero?
And this here sensitive-lookin' fella is Muddy. The less said about Muddy, the better. Ain't that right, Muddy?
What's that?
It's just my heart.
What you got a picture of your heart for?
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
So what?
Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
Right.
They told me I was too old to serve.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
 And you was "generally unfit," as I recall.
Do you like to read?
 I can't read. Nobody taught me.
 What does it say there?
 "I looked at the stars, and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face to them as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude."
 More?
Since you're the one who's smart enough to read... what's this?
It's a list of rules, it seems.
*Whose* rules?
They're for us, I suppose.
Go on and read 'em, Homer.
"One. Please don't smoke in bed."
It's too late for that one!
 Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.
Okay...
 Good night, you Princes of Maine! You Kings of New England.
Remember this! In the morning, when the tall grass is wet, you can make the Jeep slide on the grass. Can you feel it?
It's almost like flying.
What about the trees?
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
 I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
 I know what you've been doing.
 You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
 He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
Yeah, it was great.
 He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
Yeah, sure. There's no stress or strain around here...
What's wrong with you?
That's Vernon. You best stay away from him until he gets to know you better--then you best stay away from him *more*!
Out lieutenant's calling you, Homer. Mind your ass.
 You getting along okay?
Where is that Candy?
Did she leave you, Wally?
Who's the boy?
Wally, you can marry Debra if Candy leaves you!
Wally's gonna marry *me* if Candy leaves him!
You can marry all three of us, Wally!
We can take turns.
You girls make it hard for a guy to go off to war.  But I'll leave my best man here to pinch-hit for me.
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering... (grabbing another apple from a crate) Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
 You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
 You want to fight about it?
You pickin' more cider apples then anythin' else. Them drops is good only for cider. And you pickin' the stems with the apples only half the time. They good only for cider, too-- if you don't pick them stems.  The rule is, you wanna pick the apple *with* the stem, Homer. And see here... see that *bud* that's just above the stem? That's the bud for *next year's* apple--that's called the *spur*. You pick the spur, you pickin' two years in one--you pickin' next year's apple 'fore it have a chance to grow. You leave that on the branch, you hear?
 That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
I guess so...
Wilbur! Wilbur!
Wilbur, you should read this.
It's from the Board. Another letter.
 Uh... "merely suggesting that some new blood might benefit you all... someone with new ideas in the obstetrical and pediatric fields."  I think they're just testing some ideas for our next meeting.
Dr. Holtz seems nice. I think he only wants to help...
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
So what are you going to do?
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
 Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
These *credentials* are against the law!
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
 So here is my candidate. What do you think?
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
He *will* have them, Edna.
Oh, Wilbur, I don't know...  We don't even know where he is!
Where's that Homer?
Who cares?
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
Here he is.
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
What view?
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
*What* view?
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
 I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
 Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
 You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
What's lucky about that?
You know where that Wally is tonight, darlin'? He's up there in them angry stars. (gesturing at the dark sky) He's flyin' all around up there... with them Japs shooting at him.
They all on board, Mrs. Worthin'ton.
Thank you, Arthur. (see is looking at Homer) And how is our Homer working out?
Oh, he's a smart young man, most of the time--Wally was right about him.
No rotten apples?
 No, no--not this year. Well... maybe we got *one*, but it ain't Homer.
Rose... dear girl, I'm sure I can find you some other clothes.  You must have some things that would fit her.
I have a *ton* of things that would fit you.
Now, now, Candy--this girl don't need no more clothes, not for pickin'.
 Arthur, there's no such thing as a young woman who's got all the clothes she needs.
So. Not bored yet?
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I... (struggling to change the subject) ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
 You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
Okay...
I better go.
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
 Sorry!
 Come next week!
Whoa--look at that Homer! He's gettin' all dressed up for supper tonight!
He ain't gettin' dressed to have supper with *us*, Peaches!
 Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
Hungry?
They're the garbage-eaters of the ocean's floor. The seagulls clean up the shore. The lobsters clean up the bottom of the sea.
They eat everything?
Everything that falls to the bottom.
It's time somebody ate *them*.
 I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
 Wally said to say, "Hello."
 Oh! That's... nice.
 Wally said the most spectacular hits were in the oil fields at Yenangyat.
A movie *outside*?
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
People watched the movies in their cars?
 When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
Yes! I've only seen one, though.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
"King Kong". It's really good.
I haven't seen "King Kong" since I was a kid!
That's a pie apple, Wilbur. Homer said you're not supposed to eat it!
So he's an apple expert, is he?
 Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
 You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
 He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
Wilbur, it's a *gift*! How can you be angry with Homer for sending us a *gift*?
I'll show him a *gift*! I'll give him a gift he can *use*!
 But you looked as if you liked it.
 I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
And what did she die of, exactly?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
Oh, sure!
What's the *medical* explanation?
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
 At least King Kong knew what he *wanted*.
What is you *doin'* with that Candy, Homer?
 He's makin' history, I suppose.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
No trouble.
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
She's the nicest *and* the most beautiful girl I've ever known.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
I'm not in trouble.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
His name is Homer Wells...
...and his *pathetic* resume is the best I've seen. Though I find it hard to believe the Board would be interested in this character.
But he looks like an excellent young man, a first-rate candidate!
He looks like a bleeding-heart missionary *moron* to me, but that's going to be the problem with any doctor interested in coming here!
Do you know him?
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
But, Dr. Larch, he seems exceptionally qualified...
I'm not talking about his medical qualifications. It's the *Christian* thing that bothers me--I just don't see it being of much *use* around here.
 I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
We're *very* interested!
Yes, *very*!
You wouldn't be opposed to meeting with him?
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
Dr. Homer Wells.
 I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
It's a nice name, very New England.
Very *Maine*, a very *local*-sounding name.
*Very*!
I just wanted to ask you...
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back?
 He's a field hand! What could possibly hold him there?
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
Just say you're in the *apple* business, man. That's the only business you wanna be in. Just say it.
 You don't wanna go in the knife business with Mistuh Rose--just say you're in the *apple* business, Jack!
 What business are *you* in?
I'm in the *knife* business, Jack. You don't wanna go in the knife business with me.
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Almost.
I don't need no "almost" a doctor, Homer.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
You don't care about the movie?
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
At least you were never lonely.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
You're not alone in the bathroom, or... or in the shower... you're never alone in wanting the last piece of meatloaaf, or even in your own bed on a cold morning.
You don't miss it?
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Just a little privacy.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
Scrunch down like this.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
 That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
Fuzzy? Fuzzy?
What are you going to tell the little ones?
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
It was a family with a better breathing machine then the one Dr. Larch built.
The family that adopted Fuzzy, they *invented* the breathing machine. It's their business... breathing machines.
Lucky Fuzzy!
Some mail for you, Homer.
And some clothes for you, dear-- (nodding to the cider house) let's go see if they fit.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Sorry, Homer...
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
See? That's last year's glass, or from some year before. I put glass here every year. The ocean makes it beautiful.
Give me your hand.
 *Nobody* volunteers for the Burma run--he said so himself. And nobody knows *me* better than him! So how am I supposed to feel? He's a bomber pilot and I'm just selfish, I know. Well, I'm *not* a brave little girl and I'm *not* sorry.
I *know* this was right.  I told you. I'm not good at being alone.  I told him, too.
 I *know* this was right.
Right.
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
You still doin' it too fast!
He's in a big hurry, all right. I told you he's in trouble.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
It will be okay.
*What* will be okay?
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
I'll just move on, get another job somewhere.
Every time you throw a snail off the dock, you're makin' someone start his whole life over.
Maybe we're doing the snails a favor, Daddy.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
Good night, Daddy.
We'll just have to wait and see.
I used to hate it when Wally went back to college--even when it was just college! And this was when his father was still alive... I hated it even then. Naturally I hate this more.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
 Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
 I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
Uh... sure.
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
Good-bye. Have a safe trip home. Thank you, again, for all your hard work.
You take care now, Mrs. Worthin'ton.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
Right.
 We all set, I think.
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
We see you next harvest.
Don't freeze to death, Homer.
Go on and freeze to death if you want to, Homer.
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
So, you're staying.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Dear Dr. Larch, thank you for your doctor's bag...
...although it seems that I will not have the occasion to use it.
Barring some emergency, of course. I am not a doctor. With all due respect to your profession. I am enjoying my life here.
I've looked at so many women... I mean, I've seen *everything* about them, *everything*... but I never felt a thing. I felt nothing. Now... with you... it *hurts*... to look at you.
I am enjoying being a lobsterman and an orchardman--in fact, I have never enjoyed myself so much.
The truth is, I want to stay here. I believe I am being of *some* use.
My dear Homer, I thought you were over your adolescence, that period which I would define as the first time in our lives when we imagine we have something terrible to hide from those who love us.
Do you think it's not obvious to us what's happened to you?
You're fallen in love, haven't you? By the way, whatever you're up to can't be too good for your heart. Then again, it's the sort of condition that can be made worse by worrying about it. So don't worry about it!
Dear Dr. Larch, what I am learning here may not be as important as what I learned from you, but everything is new to me. Yesterday I learned how to poison mice. You use poison oats and poison corn.
Field mice girdle an apple tree. Pine mice kill the roots. I *know* what you have to do--you have to play God. Well... killing mice is as close as I want to come to playing God.
Do I interfere? When absolutely helpless women tell me that they simply *can't* have an abortion, that they simply *must* go through with having another--and yet another-- orphan... do I interfere? *Do* I? I do not. I do not even *recommend*. I just give them what they want: an orphan or an abortion.  You are my work of art, Homer. Everything else has been just a job. I don't know if you've got a work of art in you, but I know what your job is. You're a doctor!
I am not a doctor.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
They're going to replace me, Homer! The Board of Trustees is looking for my *replacement*!
I can't replace you! I'm sorry...
Sorry? I'm not 'sorry'! Not for anything I've done. I'm not even sorry that I love you!
I think we may have lot him to the world. He's not coming back.
Who's that?
It's that Homer!
It's that Candy, too...
Don't this place look like home?
It look nicer then home!
What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
How is that Wally doing?
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
 ...bridges, oil refineries, fuel depots...
Where's Jack?
He just wasn't up for the trip.
That Jack just never knew what his business was.
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
 It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
 Ain't you eatin' with us, Rose?  She used to eat with us. Now we ain't good enough for her, I guess.
She ain't hungry, maybe.
She ain't hungry every mornin' 'cause she's sick every mornin'.
You okay, Rose?
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
How many months are you?
You're not yet three months, are you?
Not yet. What do you know about it?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
But you don't look very happy.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
 Homer! Is this a workin' day or what?
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Well, we have to help her!
We have to do *something*. Don't we?  Homer?
Hi...
Hi...
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
 Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
 Yes, I *have*!
Who's the father, Rose?
You want to have the baby?
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
I can't go nowhere.
Why?
Is it the father? Does he know?
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
 No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
It sure ain't Jack.
 I'll be up top...
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
 Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
You don't understand! It's her father...
Mr. Rose *knows*?
 He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
Is it true?
Are you sleeping with your own daughter?
 I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
You a fine one to be talkin' about lies. Shame! These people took you in. That boy Wally's at *war*!
But she's your *daughter*...
And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
She's *pregnant*. Do you know *that*?
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
There's my knife, Homer. It ain't gonna do *me* no good. You give that knife to Rose Rose, you hear?
You best just watch you ass, Homer! You don't wanna end up like Jack!
No! No!
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
Why was he missing for twenty days?
Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear...
Who cares about their *gear*?
Three men jumped from the plane, but they had four compasses with them. One of the crew jumped with Captain Worthington's compass.
He was in Burma for twenty days without a compass?
He followed the Irrawaddy River, all the way to Rangoon. Somehow he managed to avoid the Japs, but not the mosquitoes.
Then it's malaria?
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
 I'm sorry.
 There are no autonomic effects, are there?
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
When will he be home, Major?
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
 There are no autonomic effects, just the paralysis of the lower extremities.
Wally can have kids, a normal sex life...
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
Daddy, *please*...
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night, Ray.
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
Nothing.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
...to do nothing.
 It's a tempting idea, I know... to do nothing.
 Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
 *Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
 If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
 I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
Stop it! Just cut it out!
 You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!
 I know, I'm sorry.
 He's *paralyzed*!
 He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
 What do you want me to *do*?
 Nothing. You're not the one who has to do anything.
Where do you think you're going?
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
Hey, hey! Stop it. Maybe I can help.
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
 What business is you in, Homer?
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
 What's that? What's it called?
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
No *almost* about it--I'm a doctor.
Get out of here, please.
I'm stayin', Homer.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
You better get some air.
The bleeding should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. The cramps will ease up, almost entirely. The bleeding is usually much lighter in two days. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
I told him that you all is sick.
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
Look at that. Them same damn rules is tacked up again!
Why don't you put them damn rules in the wood stove, Peaches?
I want to hear what they are, first.
Homer, let me hear what they are.
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
We heard that one already, Homer.
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."
That's the best place to eat lunch!
"Three: Please--even if you are very hot--do not go up to the roof to sleep."
What do they think? They must think we're crazy!
They think we're dumb niggers so we need dumb rules--that's what they think.
This is the last one.
"Four: There should be no going up on the roof at night."
Why don't they just say, "Stay off the roof!"?
Yeah, they don't want us up there *at all*!
 That's *it*?
That's it.
It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
Right.
Please don't make me say it again.
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
"...did." Well, okay.
Please don't...
 And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
 At least there's no more waiting and seeing. At least I got to see the ocean.
Rose Rose has runned away!
She took off in the night!
She took off on the bicycle, man.
Ain't nobody gonna find her, Homer-- she's long gone.  I swear, I didn't try and stop her-- I just wanna touch her hand before she go. That's all I wanna do, I swear.  Where'd she get that knife, Muddy? That looked like *your* knife--what I seen of it.
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
 Where'd she get you?
She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?
It's too late for the doctor now, Homer--ain't that right?
 She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
*You* taught her, I suppose...
That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
 There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
You listen to me: you tell them police how this happen, you tell it *this* way, you hear? My daughter, she runned off--and I so sad about it that I stabbed myself. I so unhappy that she gone, I killed myself--that what you say, you hear? That the true story--ain't that right?
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
Right?
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
Do you think she'll be all right?
She knows how to take care of herself.
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
Sure. Thanks.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
You told me you weren't any good at being alone.  You told Wally, too. Right?
 He's going to be fine, Wally's going to be fine. I know he is.
Dear Homer, I am writing to tell you about Wilbur.
Dr. Larch? Dr. Larch?
I can assure you that the overdose was entirely accidental.
Let us be happy for Dr. Larch. Dr. Larch has found a family.
Good night, Dr. Larch! Good night, Dr. Larch! Good night, Dr. Larch!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
He ain't never been outta Maine!
Ain't you sick of pine trees, Homer?
Let me tell you somethin' about Florida, Homer.
The Sunshine State!
It's so nice 'n' warm down there, you can pick them grapefruits and oranges *naked*, if you want to.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Homer, stayin' in Maine ain't movin' on!
Dr. Larch often wondered how the world was treating you.
He talked a lot about you, hoping you would be of use, whatever you were up to.
"Oh, Lord, support us all the day long..."
"...until the shadows lengthen and the evening comes, and the busy world is hushed, and the fever of life is over, and our work is done."
"Then, in Thy mercy grant us a safe lodging, and a holy rest, and peace at the last."
Amen! Amen! Amen!
Did you bring something for me?
You know what? I did.
It's from the ocean. It's for you.
What are you doing here?
We made up a room for you.
Wouldn't you be more comfortable by yourself?
Homer, do you know what this is?
Sure. It's my heart.
 Actually, it's Fuzzy's. There's nothing wrong with your heart.
Fuzzy's?!
Dr. Larch wanted to keep you out of the war, Homer--that's why he did it. That's why he told you it was yours.
I think he worried about his own heart. He said it would never stand up to Homer Wells going off to war.
"Thus I began my new life, in a new name, and with everything new about me... I felt... like one in a dream... The remembrance of that life is fraught with so much... want of hope... Whether it lasted for a year, or more, or less, I do not know. I only know that it was, and ceased to be; and... there I leave it."
What happens next?
That's tomorrow, Curly. Let's mot give the story away.
Good night, you Princes of Maine! You Kings of New England!
