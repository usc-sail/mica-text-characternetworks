Everyone's got that one summer when they were a kid... a summer so perfect, that it stays with them forever. It stays caught in time, like Camelot. pause That summer is like a book with a million blank pages that you get to fill with the greatest story you could ever dream up.  This is a story about a legend. And for us, that summer was the one when the legend got made.
Everybody sometime in their life has met a real live hero. 
They're not exactly a dime a dozen, but there's plenty of people who've done real great things. But hardly anyone has ever met a certified Legend, because most of them are dead before they get voted one.
So, to actually be there at the moment one gets made... well, forget about it. It never happens. Almost never... To understand how it all got started, you have to go back...
...to the all-time, hands down, complete and undisputed Legend that ever lived.
In any language, in any country, in any world. The Sultan of Swat. The King of Clout. The Great Bambino. You have to go back to...
...The Babe.  There's never been anyone greater than The Babe. And when he called his famous full count homerun in the 1932 world series, he made sure he'd live forever.
And it's a good thing he became immortal, because without him, what happened that summer, absolutely never 
would've happened. Weird thing was, before I moved to the neighborhood, I had no idea who he was. And he played a game I knew nothing about.
Fourteen years later, after The Babe was gone, there was another guy who had something to do with the legend getting made too. A guy who set a record that summer that was so awesome, some people still don't believe it.
Safe!
PICKLE!
Thirty-one! Maury Wills just stole number thirty-one!
 Crap! Can't beat that guy! Ya dufuses, why'd ya get him in a pickle for?! Ya know he's the damn pickle king! Rubba legs for sure! Truly rubba legs.
Game over. Sixteen zip. Murderers' Row remains undefeated.
Hey! We never got our ups!
All your moms wear boxers!
Milk-milk-pee.
Great, I'm dyin' a thirst and you pee me out!
Ham, it ain't really.
Then switch with me.
Do I look stupid?
I moved to the neighborhood about a month before school let out. I was from another state, and didn't have a single friend in a thousand miles.
It was a lousy way to end up the 5th grade, 'cause I had zip time to make friends before summer. And that's about where it all started...
Fifth grade's history, man. A hundred days, man. A Hundred days of baseball. All Day, everyday, as much as we can. That's the best.
We got all summer.
We got all summer.
Let's play.
Yeah-Yeah... let's play.
Everyone but the Timmons twins lived on my new block.
They lived in a house by the sandlot and had the world's greatest tree house, because their dad was a contractor.
Even before I knew any of them I envied that tree house...
...later, it would become second only to Cape Canaveral as a command post for history.  When I moved in that summer, I'd never played baseball, but it wasn't too tough figuring out who these guys' heroes were. So, after a week of watching... I figured baseball seemed like the best way to get in with them.
Sorry, Mom.
I thought we agreed we'd take this apart... and not spend so much time in here.
 I know - but it's just nighttime.
Scotty, have you made any friends yet?
No.
Why not, honey?
'Cause I'm still "new."
Honey, I don't want you sitting in here all summer fiddling with this stuff, like you did last summer... and the one before that.  Scotty, look at me. I know you're smart, and I'm proud of you. But you have to get outside, you have to... play.
I want you to get out in the fresh air and make friends. Run around and scrape your knees. Get dirty. Climb trees and hop fences. Get in trouble for crying out loud.  Not too much, but some. You have my permission. Now how many mothers do you think say that to their sons?
None mothers I guess.
I want you to make friends this summer, Scotty. Lots of them.
I know, but I don't - I'm no good at anything. Face it, Mom, I'm just an EGGHEAD -
- and you'll always be just an egghead with an attitude like that. So promise me, alright?
'Kay.
Maybe tomorrow you'll make some friends.
Yeah, maybe tomorrow.  Mom? Do you think Bill - I mean Dad - will teach me to play catch?
Are you kidding, he'd love it, you know what an athlete he wasIn high school.  You know what a pitcher he was in high college.
Yeah...
My real dad died when I was just a little kid. My mom married Bill a year before we moved to the neighborhood.  At the time, he and I were still getting used to each other.
Um, Dad - sorry, I mean Bill, remember you promised you'd teach me to play catch?
Um hum...
Well, could you teach me?
Sure.
Okay. Great. Thanks.
Um hum.
Hey-hey, come on! Wait up - wait up!
They never kept score. They never chose sides. They never even really stopped playing the game... it just went on forever. Everyday they picked up right where they left off the day before. It was an endless "dream game."  There was only 8 of them, so they didn't have a whole team. It didn't matter though... Benny was so good he took everyone's position when it was there ups.  I didn't know any of that then... I just knew they were having the time of their lives and I wanted to be a part of it.
Hey! Look out!
Nice catch!
Nice catch!
Hey! Throw the ball back!
Yeah-yeah, hurry up!
We gotta a game here, man!
'Kay, I'll get it!  Don't be a goofus - don't be a goofus - don't be a goofus.
WE'RE WAITING...
 My life is over.
Come on, Benny-man, didn't you see that throw?
 That kid's got the gaw'damn panty- waistiest arm I ever saw in my whole life.
I seen a guy once that threw like that. I mean not that bad, but at least so bad that he hadda move in the fourth grade 'cause they nicknamed him "Bloomers."
I bet not one of you knows how The Babe got his nickname.
Easy, 'cause of the way he looked like a little kid face.
Bull, it's just 'cause he liked kids and stuff.
Wrong. The Babe was called The Babe, because he was like the child of Yankee Stadium.
I knew it. You're all full of crap. George Herman Ruth got his nickname because his mom died when he was just a little kid, and he hadda go live in an orphanage.
Nobody liked him there. The bigger guys picked on him all the time. And when they messed with him he couldn't fight back, 'cause he was just... like scared. So when they messed with him, he cried about it.  He cried... so they called him The Babe.
How ya think that kid just felt?
Everyone knew Benny was different. Nobody ever voted or anything, but he was the leader.
Even though he seemed like a regular guy, he wasn't. Benny was special, and he was loyal.  When they'd all tried out for youth league, they'd all made it. But when they found out they'd have to play on different teams, Benny told 'em that if they couldn't play together, they shouldn't play at all. So, they stayed together.
So, the only person that ever felt sorry for me 'cause I was such a weenie was Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez.  Even though neither of us knew it at the time, we were connected. Like I had been born for just that one moment, when I would perform the world's all- time boner, and Benny would bail me out.  Connected as friends... born to meet for just that one moment.
Sorry...
 Well?...
He's too busy, Mom.
 Go back in there and ask. He'll take the time. Go on.
Um, Da -
 - I mean, Bill. Could we... I mean could you, like you said - teach me to catch today?
Um, yeah, but later, okay? I gotta get this done.
Okay, thanks.
Bill, can't you take a break and teach him now?
Mom, it's okay - 
Honey, I said I would and I will. I'm just under the gun here, ya know?
Mom, really -
- How long could it take? You can't spare a half hour to show him?
 Fine. Alright. I'll get my glove. Come on.
 There. See. Told you so.
Keep your eye on the ball. Put the glove up where it goes. Okay?
Yeah, okay, I think so.
Darn. Sorry.
That's alright, just throw it back.
Here.
Okay. I'm ready.
Keep your eye on the ball. Put the glove up where the ball goes.
Darn. My glove got -
- not bad. Right side at least. Now, just throw it back this time.
But my glove -
 Oh, my God.
Alright, Scott, listen, this one's gonna come right at you, easy, okay?
'Kay.
Just keep your eye on the ball and put your glove up. You'll catch it.
Okay.
Oh my -
- God, whadda jerk!
Bill! What happened?!
Well, he -
 - just took my eye off the ball, Mom.
There. Keep that on for an hour. It'll still be black, but it won't swell.  Sorry. We'll try again soon.
Gonna go play some ball. Need a extra guy. Wanna go?
Naw. Thanks.
Why not? Doncha like baseball?
Oh. Yeah. But, ah...
But what?
But my glove's busted. So, ya know, I can't go. Thanks, though.
That's okay.
I got a extra one.
Mom! I'm gonna go play some ball!
Thanks. Cool glove.
Yeah. Cool shiner. We gotta stop by the 5 & 10 first. Need a new ball. And chaw and stuff, ya know?
Yeah.
You dip chaw?
 Sure. A'course.
Hey! Check me out! I'm the Great Bambino!
 Who's that?
What?...  What did he say?
Were you born in a barn, man?
Yeah-yeah, what planet are you from?
You never heard of The Sultan of Swat?!
The Titan of Terror!
The Colossus of Clout!
The Colossus of Clout!
 The King of Krash!
I had no idea who they were talking about. But there was no way I could let them know that... so, I lied.
Oh! The Great Bambino! Of course. I thought you said The Great Bambi.
 That wimpy deer?
Ah, yeah - I guess. Sorry.
 So, Scott, this is Ken DeNunez; Alan McClennan, we call him Yeah-Yeah; Hamilton Porter, we call him Ham; Tommy and Timmy Timmons, Bertram Grover Weeks, and Mike "Squints" Palledorus.  He's Scott Smalls.
Hi.
He's gonna play with us. He makes nine. Now we got a team.
Why'd you bring him for, Benny?
'Cause there's eight of us, and he makes nine.
Yeah, so would my sister, but I didn't bring her!
With nine Guys we got a whole team.
No, with Elswenger we had a whole team, and Elswenger could throw!
He ain't game, Benny. He can't throw for nothin'.
Benny, you already play all the empty positions since Elswenger moved to Arizona.
And now I get to rotate 8 positions instead of 7. I need the practice.
No you don't. It's stupid, Benny. The kid's an L-7 weenie.
Yeah-yeah, Oscar Mayer even.
Oh yeah, Squints, and you're Willie freakin' Mays. You catch like a dork - anybody ever bust your chops about that?
 No, but I'm - ya know, I'm -
- and you run like a duck, Yeah- Yeah.
 'Kay-'kay... But I'm -
- part-a the game.
 Right.
Yeah-yeah.
How come he don't get to be?
You take right field, Smalls.
 Right. Okay. Ah... where exactly is that?
 Uh, over there.
Get two.
Smalls! Get one!
Here. Sorry, sorry.
Hey, you can throw it ya know.
No, I can't... I don't know how.  Um, thanks for taking me here... but I think better go.
You think too much. I bet you get straight A's and shit, huh?
No, I got a B once. Actually it was an A minus.  But it shoulda been a B.
This is baseball, you're not supposed to think, you're just supposed to play.  You ever have a paper route?
Uh, I helped a guy one time.
Throw it like you chuck a paper. When your arm gets here... just let go of it.  Just let go.
Wait - how do I catch it?
Don't worry. Just stand there and stick your glove in the air. I'll take care of it.
Smalls, get one!
Please, catch it. Please, catch it. Please, ca -
Okay! Hey, let's play ball!
Thanks.
Wait, here - your glove.
Keep it.
Everyday, first thing, we'd all pick a card from what we called "The Dugout."
It was just a shoe box, but whoever we picked, we got to be when it was our ups. One day, when Ham took his pick a little too seriously, the guys let me in on the world's most terrifying secret...
Bingo! Maury Wills!
Mickey Mou - ah, Mantle.
Say hey, Willie Mays.
Stan Musial.
Lou Brock.
Lou Brock - I mean, Luis Aparicio.
Frank Robinson.
Oh... Bob Uecker.
Hank Aaron. I'm up.
Wait a sec, I'll get it!
NOOOOOOOOOO! STOPPPPPP!
Holy crap, you coulda been killed!
Yeah-yeah - truly! Whadda you doin'?!
Well, you were all leavin', so I thought I'd just -
- if you were thinkin' you wouldn't a thought that!
You can't go back there, Smalls.
Then how do we get the ball?
We don't.
We don't.
It's gone.
Forever even.
Forget it, it's a memory.
Game's over. We'll get a new one tomorrow. Just forget it. We'll never see it again.
Why not?
 The Beast.
Go over there, real slow, and be quiet. Don't touch the fence, just peek through that hole in the green stuff... go on.
Something got the ball!  What was that thing?!
Campout.
Wanna s'more?
Some more of what?
No. You wanna s'more?
I haven't had anything yet, so how can I have any more of nothing?
You kill me Smalls. Look, these are s'mores stuff. Pay attention:  First you take the graham - you put the chocolate on the graham, Hershey's of course - you hold the chocolate on the graham while you roast the mallow-
-then when the mallow's flamin', ya stuff it on the chocolate and cover it with the other end.  Then, you scarf.
 Kinda messy... Good though.
Alright, listen up.  First time DeNunez heard this story he FAINTED -
- Bull, Squints!
You did, man.
When Yeah-Yeah heard it he peed his pants.
Shut up, Squints - did not!
You did, man.
And when The Ham heard it he barfed up two bags of marshmallows.
Liar! It was only one.
So stay away from the door... you might fall out. And don't sit on your sleeping bag... you could shit your pants.  Now, quiet...
The legend of The Beast goes back a long time... before any of us could pick up a baseball. Back to a place called Mertle's Acres.
The Beast belongs to Mr. Mertle, the guy that used to own Mertle's Acres Junkyard. And nobody's ever seen him since the day it happened...
Mertle's Acres was a bitchin' place, that had everything you could ever imagine.
And the stuff was worth a fortune. So, one day Mr. Mertle got him this new pup from the pound. They were glad to get rid of him, on account of while he'd been there, he'd killed three dogs bigger than he was.  That was exactly what Mr. Mertle figured he needed to protect his junkyard, 'cause people kept stealing stuff at night, when he wasn't around.
So he bought The Beast, and set him loose in Mertle's Acres.
The Beast was still just a pup of six months, but he already weighed a 150 pounds... and he kept gettin' bigger.
He threw The Beast a trash bag full of meat every night, and just left him alone. All alone in the whole place by himself... to grow.
And so, in a few months, the pup grew into The Beast. And he grew big as a car. And he grew mean, 'cause nobody liked him, and he didn't like nobody either.  And so he only had one thing on his mind... to kill.
And he did. And he liked it.
The Beast was the most perfect junkyard dog that ever lived... a true killing machine.  After awhile, the police started getting phone calls from people, reporting all the missing thieves. The ones The Beast had killed... it added up to about 37 guys.
But they never found a single body... not one. Some people say they all got away, and were just so scared that they ended up in insane asylums and stuff.  But we know what really happened.
The Beast... ate them.  He ate them bones and all.
The Beast was good at his guarddog job. Too good. So the cops said he had to be retired. But he didn't have to be killed or nothin', on account of there was no evidence... no bones... no teeth for dental records.
The police told Mr. Mertle that if wanted to keep The Beast, he hadda lock him in his backyard, so he could never get out.
And that he hadda chain him up, so's in case he tried to get out to eat children and stuff, he couldn't.
Mr. Mertle asked the cops how long he had to keep his pup chained up like a slave.
They said... until forever.
And so... The Beast sits there under that lean-to, dreaming about the time when he can break the chain and get out... dreaming of the time when he can chase and kill again.
See, man. That's why you can't go over there. Nobody ever has. Nobody ever will.
One kid did, but nobody ever seen him again.
That ain't true -
- yeah it is! He got eaten!
Yeah-yeah - that kid who went to get his kite... what was his name?
"Boogers" Fleming?
No. It was that guy with the warts on his face.
Davy "The Toad."
That's what I said.
Davy "The Toad" Stodenrous.
Yeah, The Toad...
Yeah-yeah, poor Toad.
 Nuh-uh... none of that's true. You guys are just -
- oh, yeah?... Come here. Stick your head out the window and look down.
 He's down there!
You bet he is.
Whatever goes over that fence... stays there.
It becomes the property of The Beast... Forever.
I learned that more than a 150 baseballs had gone over that fence... and not one of them was ever seen again. Even when some brave kid worked up enough courage to peek over the fence. 
 Because, when they went over, they vanished.  I knew it was true, because when I looked down in there, I didn't see a single... solitary... one.
What took you so long?! We been here forever already!
Squints was pervin' a dish.
Shut up, I wasn't!
Yeah-Yeah you were! Yer tongue was hangin' outta yer head and you was swoonin'!  Oh-oh Wendy Peffercorn my darling lover girl...
Hold me back! Hold me back!
I am holdin' you back Squints.
Oh, yeah. Well, lemme go then. 
So, where'd you get the money this time Yeah-Yeah?
Oh, yeah-yeah! It was great! So I went around pretended like I was selling perscriptions to magazines. And the people asked if they should pay me now. So I said yeah-yeah, pay me now! And they did!
Sonavabitch!
What-what?! I'll take it back. I know it was crappy, but I didn't have no money, I -
- naw, don't, man. He's just mad he didn't think of it.
Yeah, you know how many lawns I hadda mow when it was my turn?! Geez. Let's play.
I can't take it no more, Benny. I'm bakin' like a toasted cheeser!
It's hotter than the fires of hell.
It's hotter than a fish in a fryin' pan.
Come on, don't be wimpy.
Face it, Benny. It's not a fit day out for man nor beast. We gotta call it for the day.
Vote then. Everyone that wants to be a can't-hack-it panty waist, and wear their momma's bra, raise your hand.
Fine. Be like that. So what're we gonna do then?
Scam Pool Honeys!
Hamonball!
Benny would've played ball all day and all night... rain shine, tidal wave, whatever, it didn't matter. Baseball was the only thing he cared about and everything else was just a waste of time.  But, of all the things we ever did besides baseball, goin' to the pool was what he tolerated best. Even though none of us had ever seen a Playboy magazine - which we constantly lied about - we figured the pool was the next best thing to being there.
It wasn't the Pool Honeys like we said, 'cause if any one of them had come up to any one of us, we'd of peed our pants.  We went for... the Lifeguard.
And one day, it became too much for Michael "Squints" Palledorous. And he did the most desperate thing any of us had ever seen.
Oh, man...
Yeah-yeah, too cruel.
She don't know what she's doing.
She don't know what she's doing.
Yeah she does. She knows exactly what she's doing.
I've swum here every summer of my adult life... and every summer there she is.  Lotioning... oiling... smiling.  I - can't - take - this - no - more!
What's wrong with him?
 Don't-know, but that's the deep end, and Squints can't swim!
Squints!
Oh my God! He's drowning!
You little pervert!
Did you plan that?!
A'course I did. Been plannin' it for years.
Michael "Squints" Palledorous walked a little taller that day. And we had to tip our hats to him. He was lucky she hadn't beat the crap out of him. We wouldn't have blamed her. What he'd done was sneaky, rotten and low.  And cool.  Not another one among us would've ever, even for a million dollars, had the guts to put the move on the Lifeguard. He did. He had kissed a woman. And he kissed her long and good.  We got banned from the pool forever that day... but every time we walked by after that, the Lifeguard looked down from her watchtower, right over at Squints... and smiled.
Eee! Eee! Eee! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Hey, check me out! I'm the mighty King Kong!  Hey! C'mon! It was a joke, ya dopes! Do I _look_ like a monkey?!
Shut up, blockhead.
Play us and you'll find out why, Phillips.
Benny, man, are we gonna let 'em get away with that?!
Yeah. For now. Let's go.
You think he really died in the end?
Who?
King Kong...
Not possible. He's so big that fallin' off the Empire State's just like us fallin' off a roof... he's alive.
So whadda you think happened to him?
Most likely.
Hey, guys? Has anyone ever really seen The Beast?
Look, Smalls. You ever seen King Kong for real? In person, I mean?
No. But -
- well, he's real right?
Yeah, a'course.
And he's still out there somewhere right?
Yeah.
See, there's just somethings that are. Ya know, stuff that it's better not to talk about... 'cause thinkin' about it just makes it worse.  Nobody has to see The Beast to know he's there.
 You don't think that The Beast is really...
King Kong? Naw! God is that stupid! No stinkin' way! Oh boy, had me feelin' like a douf there for a minute! Whew, what a relief!
Hey, who d'ya think'd win in a fight, King Kong or Godzilla?
Godzilla. King Kong. 'Zilla! Kong! 'ZILLA! KONG!
Yeah-yeah, wait a sec, maybe they'll do a movie someday and we'll find out.
Yeah. That would be cool. I'd see that. Kong would kick his ass. No way, 'Zilla's got that fire breath stuff, he'd fry the monkey!
Besides The Great Bambino, who I still had no clue about, Benny had one living hero.
Yeah-yeah, here he comes. He's gonna steal second.
Naw he ain't, not yet.
A guy that would break the stolen bases record that year that had stood for as many years as there were baseball's lost to The Beast.
He's gonna go, Benny. Here he goes, man. Right now, watch, watch. There, there!
No... not yet.
Maury Wills became a hero for what he did.
He's... gonna... go... riiiight... now.
 How'd you know that? How'd you guess? How'd ya know?
Benny... would become a Legend.
 Get your glove, c'mon.
What's the big deal?
Nightgame!
There was only one nightgame a year. On the Fourth of July, the whole sky would brighten up with fireworks, giving us just enough light for a game.  We played better then too. Because I guess, we all felt like Big Leaguers under the lights at some great stadium.  Benny felt like that all the time.
We all knew Benny was different. We knew that he was gonna go on to bigger and better games.  Because everytime we stopped to watch the sky that night like regular kids, Benny was there to call us back.
For him, baseball wasn't just a game. For Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez...
...baseball was life.
Truly rubba legs.
Truly rubba legs.
What'id you say, crapface?
Come on! We'll take you on right here, right now! Come on! Right now!
Watch yer mouth, jerk!
Asshole!
Butt sniffer!
Fart smeller!
You mix yer Wheaties with your momma's toe jam!
YOU PLAY BALL LIKE A GIRL!
You heard me.
Count on it, pee drinkin' craphead.
PLAAAAAAAY BALLLLLLLL!
I got it. I got it.
I thought you had it.
Somebody get it!
You - are - out - of - here! Out! Gone! Dead! To the moon! Roger, Wilco, Over and OUT!
Ah, you're out.
 That's one. Get used to it.
guys strut along, air-batting, mime-catching. Benny RIPS a momentous victory slide.
Crack! Boom! Outta here! You see the looks on their faces? Did ya? It was like, "Duh... so that's how you play baseball."
Crap! I almost forgot. Chaw!
I was savin' it for a good time.
What is it?
Geez, Smalls... I s'pose you don't who The Babe is either. It's chaw. Plug. Wad. Chewing Tobacco!
Whadda you do with it?
You're killin' me, Smalls. You chew it, of course.
All the pros do.
Yeah-yeah, gives ya tons of energy.
Let's dip.
Let's dip.
Smooth.
Juicy.
Tangy.
Kinda tastes like an ashtray smells.
Supposed to.
Let's ride.
I'll be back in an hour, Scotty, I'm taking Dad to the airport.
 'Kay. Where you goin'?
Chicago, on business for a week. Listen, Scott, while I'm gone, you're the man of the house. Understand?
Yeah, I guess so.
We'll take another stab at catch when I get back, okay? So, take care of things while I'm gone. I'm counting on you.
 Okay. I will.
Once we got over trying to be big shots, we just stuck to what we could handle, and swore off the hard stuff forever. When we finally got back together for some baseball, something amazing happened.  It was an omen... one that was meant just for Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez.
Whad'ya get, Ham?
A Mickey Mantle and 7 guys I never heard of. How 'bout you?
A Brooks Robinson and a Koufax. Pretty good.
I got junk.
One Drysdale, a bunch a duds.
Yeah-yeah, me too. Four bombs, but one Whitey Ford.
Benny, whad -
Hey, Benny, whatsa matter?
You okay, man?
Oh, my God...
Imfuckingpossible. (ALTERNATE LINE, same BELOW) Unstinkinbelievable!
Imfuckingpossible. Don't tell mom I said that tim.
I won't.
This can't happen... can it?
It just did.
Yeah-yeah, it's an omen.
Oh geez... Oh geez. I - I don't believe it. Maury Wills just stole 80 bases!
We gotta play. I gotta play right now, guys. Right now.
What's it mean?
It's a miracle, Smalls. A damn miracle.
We all expected something to happen right then... during that game. What we had just witnessed was bordering on the supernatural... we knew that greater hands than ours were at work.  And it happened alright.  It happened right in front of our noses... and we didn't even know it.
Bitchin'.
Naw, it ain't.
C'mon, Benny, maybe two, three guys in history have ever busted the guts out of a ball. That's what the omen was.
Truly. Sure. Absolutely. Yeah-yeah, Benny. It must be so.
All's it means is that we can't play no more. It's only noon, and I just blew the whole day for us.
No, you didn't. It's the most amazing thing I ever seen.
Anybody got any money?  Then it ain't okay, 'cause now we can't play no more.
Yeah, we can.
What, you got 98 extra cents just layin' around at home, Smalls?
No, but I got a ball.
 I got it! Let's play!
Bitchin'. Your ball, your ups.
Batter up!
Nice crank, Smalls.
Decent cut.
It's outta here! Who's got the big bat now, boys!
Smalls. Smalls. Smalls. Smalls.
What the hell's he doing?
Maybe the shock of his first homer was just too much for him.
We gotta get that ball back.
Right! Good one, Smalls.
Sure. We'll just hop over and say, excuse me Mr. Beast sir, could we have our ball back, oh, and please don't kill us while we're here!
It was a great shot, but forget about it... game's over. We'll get another ball.
You don't understand!
Sure we do. You feel bad 'cause you belted a homer, and now we can't play no more.
No! You don't understand! THAT WASN'T MY BALL!
Whadda you mean it wasn't your ball?
It's my stepdad's. I stole it from his trophy room. It was a present or soemthing - somebody gave it to him. We have to get it back. He's gonna kill me!
Smalls... listen to me. This is a matter of life and death.  Where did your old man get that ball?
I dunno... I think some lady gave it to him.
Some lady?...
Yeah, she even signed her name on it.  Some lady named Ruth... Baby Ruth.
BAAAYYYBE RUUUUUTH?!
The Beast got it.
You're dead as a doornail, Smalls.
You're dead as a doornail, Smalls.
Nice knowing you.
Nice knowing -
- shut up, Tommy.  Smalls, you mean to tell me you went home and swiped a ball that was signed by Babe Ruth, and brought it out here and actually played with it?
And actually played with it?!
Yeah, but I was gonna put it back.
But it was signed by Babe Ruth!
Well, who is she?!
What?! What?!  What did he say?!
The Sultan of Swat!
The King of Krash!
The Colossus of Clout!
BABE RUTH!
 The Great Bambino!
 OH, MY GOD! THAT'S THE SAME GUY?!
Yeah. Smalls, Babe Ruth is the greatest baseball player that ever lived. People say he was less than a God, but more than a man. Ya know... like Hercules or somethin'.  The ball that you just aced to The Beast is worth... well, more than your whole life.
I don't feel so good.
 We gotta get that ball back.
When does your old man get home from work?
He's gone on business for a week.
Okay, we need 98 cents. So, everybody spread out and find some soda bottles and cash 'em in. We need a new baseball.
I dunno, Benny-man.
Yeah-yeah, it's pretty crappy.
He ain't gonna buy that, Benny. It doesn't look anything like the Babe's signature.
It doesn't matter what it looks like. His mom's never gonna know the difference. This'll just buy us some time, ya dorks.
Scotty?
Huh?!
Honey, what are you doing in here?
Ah... just looking at Bill's - I mean Dad's baseball.
You know he doesn't like you touching his things.
Yeah, I know. Sorry, Mom.
Has he ever told you about that ball?
Uh - no, not really, I don't think so - no, he hasn't at all - I don't know _anything_ about it.
It's signed by Babe Ruth...
...the greatest baseball player that ever lived.
Um... really?
It sure is. Dad's father gave it to him. Maybe someday, he'll give it to you.
 Uh... neat.
It was salt in an open wound. Even my own mom, who was only a grown-up girl, knew who Babe Ruth was.
So, how do we get it back?
I have no idea.
I was dead meat. I knew it. They knew it. We had thought that those cards Benny had gotten meant that something great was going to happen. Now I figured that they'd just meant my life was over.
Can't we just hop the fence and get it?
Remember Davy Stodenrous.
Poor Toad.
Oh, yeah. I forgot.  Hey? Why don't we just go over there and knock on the door, and ask Mr. Mertle to get it for us?
Are you outta your mind?! Mr. Mertle is the meanest old man that ever lived! He's the one that sicked The Beast on The Toad!  That's not an option, Smalls. Forget about it.
Oh. Okay. I will.
We need to assess the situation!
 Of course! Right! Good one, Squints! Access  the situation! Okay!
Um, Squints? How do we do that?
First we survey the enemy's environment, then we make note of the surrounding terrain.
What?...
 I heard that on "Combat." Let's just look out the window.
He's darin' us!
He's darin' us!
He's waitin' for us, man. Just like he did with The Toad.
 Poor Toad.
We're on his territory now.
Think he's pissed?
Is Doby Gillis a dork? Anybody got any bright ideas?
We had absolutely no idea what the hell we were gonna do. So things started primitively.
It ain't mine. I told you, it's my little sister's!
 A-okay. Roger, affirmative. Initiate retreival suction.
We have suction! Pull it up! PULL IT UP!
We've been going about this all wrong. I blame myself. We need total surprise. 
Therefore, we tunnel. The Beast will never expect it.
 I got it! I got it!
It's huge - oh, my God! It's huge - pull him out! It's huge! PULL HIM OUT!
It's huge - pull him out! Oh God, it's like a dinosaur! Wh - Wh - Where am I?!
Yeah-Yeah! Get hold of yourself! What'd you see?!
 Oh-oh, it was like hugeness and darkness and like the world was ending and the devil came up through the ground and the - and the - and the -
- somebody slap him quick! We're losin' him!
Thanks. I needed that.
Yeah-yeah, I know - I'm lightest. But I ain't goin' over there! NO WAY!
Sorry, Smalls. It was a good idea anyway.
Yeah, tough luck, Smalls.
It won't be that bad, Smalls. Your dad'll probably only shoot you or something.
Hey-hey, don't blame me! I didn't hit the ball over there, man!
Yeah-yeah, okay. But if I say pull me up, you guys better PULL ME UP!
Here. Put these on.
Wha -? Why? Whadda I need All this stuff for Benny? I mean, why a mask and a gonad Protector?
Oh, ah, nuthin', ya know, just For, ah... Altitude leveling And stuff. Put it on.
Don't worry. We're professionals.
Our Dad's a contractor.
 Okay-okay, I'm right over it. Let me down - slow!
Ahhhh! Stop! STOP!
'Kay-'kay, tip me, hurry up. I'm gettin' the woollies.
Okay get me outta here!
HELP! I'M LOSIN' HIM!
 H - h - help! Help! HELP-HELP- HELP!  Hail Mary Father who art star light twinkle twinkle hey diddle diddle -
Yeah-yeah, I did it! SO WHAT?! You jerks, I told you to pull me back faster!  You - you penises.
Yeah-Yeah grew two feet in our eyes after that. There was no stinkin' way any of us would've showed back up, if we'd loaded our drawers.  Yeah-Yeah did. He showed back up and got right to work, like nothing ever happened.
I think I know how to get it.  Anybody got an Erector Set?
That thing with the nuts and bolts and tiny wrenches that you can build junk out of?
Exactly.
Never heard of it.
I used to have one when I was like I dunno, a little kid.
 Might have some pieces. Gee, I don't think so. I'd have to look. Maybe in the attic. Not in our room though.
Guess I had more than I thought. Forgot my grandma got me some for my birthday. It's my little brother's.
Bitchin'.
I really like Erector Set.
 Me too. I was just thinkin' the same thing. Couldn't agree more, Smalls. I play with mine all the time.
Let's get to work. Here's the plans -
 Fire!
I got it! I got it!
My life was over. Just as Bill had finally warmed up to me, and asked me to be the man of the house, I had to knock a priceless chunk of history into the clutches of a monster. Great.
We can't get it back, Babe.  I'm sorry.
M - M - Mom?...
Who's there?!
Now don't go peeing your pants or nuthin', I'm just here to give ya a hand.
B - B - But, you're...
...dead? Legends never die, kid.
You're really him. You're The Babe. The Sultan of Swat. The King -
- of Krash and a hundred other dopey names. Forget about that, we ain't got much time. I'm here 'cause you're in some kinda pickle, right?
Yeah.
A baseball with my John Hancock on it went over a fence, and you can't get it back. Right?
Yeah, right.
 Then just hop over there and get it. There ya go. Problem solved.  See ya, kid.
Wait! I can't.
Can't what?
Go into that backyard.
Why not?
There's a Beast back there.
What kind?
A giant gorilla-dog-thing that ate one kid already.
Is that a fact? Listen to me, kid. 
Everybody gets one chance to do something great. Most people either never take the chance 'cause they're too scared, or they don't recognize it when it spits on their shoes.  This is your "big chance," and ya shouldn't let it go by.  Remember those cards you got the other day?
Sure, yeah, five Maury Wills all in the same pack.
What're the odds on that?
About a zillion to one.
More even. Someone's tellin' you somethin', kid. And if I was you... I'd listen.
Yeah, but what?
You're the one with the rubba legs. Figure it out.  You gotta do what your heart tells you, else you'll spend the rest of your life wishin' you had.
You mean, I should hop that fence - and pickle with THE BEAST?!
Lemme tell you something... you remember that called shot homer I hit?
Sure, the greatest most famous and legendary home run of all time.
Yeah, right, well said. 
 Well, you think I knew I was gonna swat that?
Sure ya did, Babe.
Not a chance. Matter of fact, all the way down to first I kept sayin' to myself, "you lucky bum."  Think about that, kid. I'll see ya later.
Remember, kid. There's heroes and there's Legends. Heroes get remembered... but Legends never die.  Follow your heart, kid, and you'll never go wrong.
 I had a dream. Get dressed. We're goin' to the sandlot.
Benny - wait. It's okay, it was my fault. I'll just take whatever I get. You don't have to do this.
 Yeah I do, Smalls. I have to.
 ...Follow your heart, kid, and you'll never go wrong.
YOWWWWW!
OOOOH SSSSHIT!
What're we waitin' for?! Let's go after 'em!
 Mommy, mommy - wook! Ah, ah - goggy!  Big goggy.
Sandlot!
This way! Shortcut!
LOOK OUT!
Oh noooooo!
I GOT IT!
Help him! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Help him!
Pick him up! Scoot him up so I can let him off!  COME ON!
 Easy. Easy, boy.
We can play forever now.
Hello?...
Um, we brought your dog home.
Hercules? How'd he get out?
Well, sir... um, we kind of, well, what happened was -
- we hit a baseball into your yard. Then we tried to get it and -
- why didn't you just come to the door... I'd have gotten it for you.
Well, thanks for bringin' him back.  Why don't you boys come in... we can talk about baseball.
You knew Babe Ruth?
Yeah. And he knew me too.  They never let us play together, but we were friends. Good friends. He was almost as great a hitter as I was. But, he'd of told you he was better.
 This the one that went over my fence?
Yeah.
This is an old ball, boys. Really old.  Hercules gave it a good chewing, didn't he?
 Yes, sir.
You sound upset, son - what's wrong?
Well, you see... that ball belongs to my stepdad... and, uh - it was signed by Babe Ruth.
Hmm. Well, I'm sure your dad will understand.
I don't think so.
 Son, move Maury Wills to second base for me, will ya?
If he steals third that'll be number  Helluva pickle you're in, boy.
Yes, sir...
I'll make you a deal. If you boys come over once a week and talk baseball with me, I'll trade you balls.
Well, that's really nice of you... but this ball really is signed by The Babe.
 This one really is too... and all the rest of the '27 Yankees.
Oh my God - Murderers' Row.
 Lou Gehrig...
Babe Ruth.
 They're all there.
Deal.
This better be good.
It was weird that Benny said Babe Ruth was like the Hercules of baseball, and then The Beast's name turned out to be Hercules.  It was also strange that Mr. Mertle had a Murderers' Row ball to replace the one signed by The Babe.
Some people might say that it was all a coincidence... but looking back at it now, it seems like everything was connected, just like me and Benny.  It was like we were a part of the same myth as The Babe... the Myth of Baseball.
Guys, supper's ready.
 Give us another ten minutes. I'm helpin' my boy break in his new glove.
That was the last summer that we all got to play together. 
But it would stay with us forever.  Yeah-Yeah's parents shipped him off to military school. Timmy and Tommy grew up to build skyscrapers. Ham went to college and became a pediatrician. DeNunez played triple A ball and never got to the majors. Bertram got really into the sixities and no one ever saw him again. Squints grew up and married Wendy Peffercorn; they bought the Five & Dime and they still own it to this day. Hercules lived to be 199 years old... in human years.
After Benny pickled the Beast, his reputation spread all over town. From then on he was known as Benny "The Juet" Rodriguez.
The nickname stuck with him the rest of his life.
 That's a triple, and that'll put the winning run on third, with two out in the bottom of the ninth. What a shot!
Lasorda's sending in a pinch runner - and it'll be...  I don't believe it! Lasorda's calling up the "Old Man" to pinch-run in the biggest clutch situation this season! They say the veteran's lost a step or two. But if I were you, I'd get ready for some fireworks.
 Give 'em hell, Jet.
I'll do my best, Maury.
SAFE! SAFE! SAFE!
The Dodgers win the pennant! The Dodgers win the pennant!
I don't believe it, the Old Man stole home! The Old Man -
 The Jet stole home! The Jet stole home!!
