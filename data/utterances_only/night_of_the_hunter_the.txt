Beware of false prophets...
...which come to you in sheep's clothing...
...but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
What's wrong?
 Heyy! (then he shouts to all and to us) Heyy!
Ye shall know them by their fruits.
A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit...
Neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
What's it to be, Lord, another widow? Has it been six? Twelve?... I disremember.
You say the word, and I'm on my way.
You always send me money to go forth and preach your Word.
I am tired. Sometimes I wonder if you really understand.  Not that you mind the killin's...
Yore Book is full of killin's.
But there are things you do hate, Lord: perfume-smellin' things -- lacy things -- things with curly hair --
No, there are too many of them; you can't kill a world.
You driving an Essex tourin'-car with a Moundsville license?
Harry Powell, for the theft of that touring car you will spend thirty days in the Moundsville Penitentiary.
 Preacher Harry Powell.
A car thief! Picked up where you were! A man of God?  Harry Powell.
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
 There! What's so hard about that!
 Daddy!
Where's your Mom?
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Listen to me John.
 Listen! This money here! We got to hide it before they get me! There's close to ten thousand dollars.  Under a rock in the smokehouse? Ah no. Under the bricks in the grape arbor? No, they'd dig for it.
 Why sure! That's the place!
 That's him.
 He prob'ly still has that gun.
Here they come.
Dad, you're bleeding...
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
Yes, Dad.
You understand?
Not even her?
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
 I will guard Pearl with my life...
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
And I won't never tell about the money.
You, Pearl. You swear too.
 Who's them Blue Men yonder?
 Blue men.
Ben Harper!
I'm goin' now children. Goodbye.
Drop that gun, Harper. We don't want them kids hurt.
Just mind what you swore, son. Mind, boy!
 Don't!
 Don't!
Dad!
Ben Harper, it is the sentence of this Court that for the murder of Ed Smiley and Corey South, you be hanged by the neck until you are dead, and may God have mercy on your soul.
I got you all buffaloed! You ain't never gonna git it outen me; not none o' you!
 Where, Ben? Where? Where?
 And a little child shall lead them.
 Come on, boy: tell me.
 Ben, I'm a Man of God.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
No, Ben.
What'd I say? (he grabs Preacher's throat and shakes him) What? What? What? What?
 You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
Hm!
 You killed two men, Ben Harper.
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
You, Preacher?
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
 I'll bet.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
 Keep talkin', Preacher.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
 You reckon the Lord wouldn't change his mind about you if...
Lord You sure knowed what You was doin' when You brung me to this very cell at this very time. A man with ten thousand dollars hid somewheres, and a widder in the makin'.
Any trouble?
No.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
He carried on some; kicked.
He never told about the money.
 No.
What do you figure he done with it?
 He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
 That you, Bart? Supper's waitin'.
 Mother: sometimes I think it might be better if I was to quit my job as guard.
 You're always this way when there's a hangin'. You never have to be there.
Sometimes I wish I was back at the mine.
And leave me a widow after another blast like the one in '24? Not on your life, old mister!
 Hing, hang, hung. See what the Hangman done!
 Hung, hang, hing! See the Robber swing!
 Hing, hang, hung! Now my song is done!
Are you goin' to buy it, John?
 Uh-Hawwww! (They glance toward her.)
 So your Mommy's keepin' you out of school! Poor little lambs!
And how is your poor, poor mother?
She's at Spoon's Ice Cream Parlor.
 The Lord tends you both these days!
 Didn't they never find out what your father done with all that money he stole?
When they caught him, there wasn't so much as a penny of it to be seen! Now what do you make of that! Eh, boy?
Pearl and me, we have to go.
 Hing, hang, hung.
You better not sing that song.
Why?
'Cause you're too little.
Can we get some candy?
No.
Howdy, youngins.
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
 Fiddlesticks!
 One solid brown sody, one Lovers' Delight.
'Tain't a matter of wantin' or not wantin'! You're no spring chicken, you're a grown woman with two little youngins; it's a man you need in the house, Willa Harper!
Tell me a story, John.
Once upon a time there was a rich king... (he sees the shadows on the wall and gets up and looks at them) ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
The Blue Men?
 Just a man. (he climbs into bed and pulls up the covers) Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
 'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
 Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle Birdie's around.
 First day my jints is limber enough I'll haul her up and give her a good caulkin'.
Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
I been mindin' Pearl.
Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
'Scuse me, Cap, while I sweeten up my coffee.
 Dead and gone these twenty-five years and never takes her eyes off me.
 Man o' my years needs a little snort to get his boiler heated of a morning.
This mornin' I was talkin' to this stranger up at the boarding-house. He knowed your Dad!
Where did he know Dad?
Well, boy, I'll not hide the truth; it was up at Moundsville Penitentiary.
I got to go now, Uncle Birdie.
Why shucks boy, you just got here.
 I told Mom I'd be back to Spoon's for Pearl.
 God works in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform.
I was with Brother Harper almost to the end;...
 ...and now that I'm no longer employed by the Penitentiary it is my joy to bring this small comfort to his loved ones.
 It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
So you ain't with the State no more?
No, Brother; I resigned only yesterday. The heart-renderin' spectacle of them poor men was too much for me.
Ah, little lad, you're staring at my fingers.
Shall I tell you the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
H-A-T-E! (he thrusts up his left hand) It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low! L-O-V-E! (he thrusts up his right hand) See these here fingers, dear friends! These fingers has veins that lead straight to the soul of man! The right hand, friends! The hand of Love!
 Now watch and I'll show you the Story of Life. The fingers of these hands, dear hearts! -- They're always a- tuggin' and a-warrin' one hand agin' t'other. (he locks his fingers and writhes them, crackling the joints) Look at 'em, dear hearts!
 Old Left Hand Hate's a-fightin' and it looks like Old Right Hand Love's a goner!
 But wait now! Hot dog! Love's a- winnin! Yessirree!
It's Love that won! Old Left Hand Hate's gone down for the count! (he crashes both hands onto the table)
I never heard it better told. I wish every soul in this community could git the benefit. You jest got to stay for our church pick-nick Sunday!
 I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
What did he tell you?
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
Is that all?
Why, no, boy; he told me lots and lots of things. Nice things, boy.
My, that fudge smells yummy!
 It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
Don't he have the grandest singin' voice?
 John! Pearl!
Run along and play, you two.
Where?
Down by the river. My goodness!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
John don't like him much.
Pearl dotes on him.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
There's something else.
What?
The money, Icey.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
You'll come right out and ask that Man of God!  Mr. Paow-well!  Clear that evil mud out of your soul!
 John! Pearl!
 Come along hee-ere and get some fuu- udge!
 I don't want no fudge.
 You'll do what you're told!
You go set down by the River.
 Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
Get along with you.
You!!!
That young lady'd better look sharp or some smart sister between here and Captina's a-gonna snap him up right from under her nose! (they nod and agree, ad lib) She's not the only fish in the river! (more agreement. John and Pearl join Icey. Icey speaks to John) Now you two stay put!
 Shilly-shallying around...
 A husband's one piece of store goods ye never know till you get it home and take the paper off.
 Did Ben Harper ever tell you what he done with that money he stole?
My dear child, don't you know?
She's moonin' about Ben Harper. That wasn't love, it was just flapdoodle. (agreeing nods and murmurs) Have some fudge, lambs. (she hands some down to John and Pearl. Pearl smears her mouth with it; John, watching always towards his mother, takes one nibble and throws the rest away) When you're married forty years, you know all that don't amount to a hill o'beans! I been married to my Walt that long, and I'll swear in all that time I'd just lie there thinking about my canning.
 John! John?
A woman's a fool to marry for that. It's something for a man. The good Lord never meant for a decent woman to want that -- not really want it! It's all just a fake and a pipe-dream.
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
That money's at the bottom of the river wrapped around a 12-pound cobblestone.
Thank you, Harry.
John...
Sshhh...
I feel clean now! My whole body's just a quiverin' with cleanness!
John: here.
Your tie's crooked.
 'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
 When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
 When'll the skiff be ready?
 And the times that are gone by. I'll have her ready inside of a week; and then we'll go fishin'. How's your Maw?
O, she's all right.
How's your sister Pearl?
Just fine.
Leavin', boy?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
And mind now -- I'll have your Paw's skiff in ship-shape, 'side of a week.
 Is somebody there?
 Is anybody here?
 Good evening, John.
I had a little talk with your mother tonight, John; and your mother decided it might be best for me to -- let you know the news.
Your mother told me tonight she wanted me to be a daddy to you and your sister. We're going to get married, son.
Did you hear what I said, son?
Huh?
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
 You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
 -- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
 You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
 Tell me what, boy?
Nothin'!
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
No. No.
No matter, boy, we've got a long time together.
 Wave yer hands! Great sakes!
 You wait here while I get your night- things.
Now can I tell?
Hm?
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
You swore, Pearl!
 John! Don't!
You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
I love Mr. Powell lots and lots, John.
Don't you tell! Don't you NEVER DARE tell!
 Oh! It's... uh...
 Harry...
Fix that window shade.
 Harry!
 I was praying.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
No, Harry! I thought --
I think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven.
 Get up, Willa.
Harry, what --
Get up.
Now go and look at yourself yonder in that mirror.
Do as I say.
LOOK at yourself.
What do you see, girl?
You see the body of a woman! The temple of creation and motherhood. You see the flesh of Eve that Man since Adam has profaned. That body was meant for begetting children. It was not meant for the lust of men.
Do you want more children, Willa?
I -- no, I --
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
Yes.
You can get back into bed now and stop shivering.
 Help me to get clean so I can be what Harry wants me to be.
 AAA-MEN!
AAA-MENN!
 You have all sinned!
Yes! Yes!
But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
 And he slew two human beings and he come to me and he said: Take this money and buy your per-fumes and paint!
But Brethren, that's where the Lord stepped in! That's where the LORD stepped in!
Yes!
 Yes! Yes!
 And the Lord told that man --
Yes! Yes!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
 Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
 IN THE RIIV-ER!
Now! You're John -- and you're Pearl.
 Pearl?... Pearl?
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
You what?
 Pearl! You ain't --
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
 It's all here.
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
 John?
Oh -- yes?
What are you doing, boy?
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
What's taking you so long about it?
 It -- she --
What's that you're playing with, boy?
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
Come on, children!
Now, up to bed with the both of you.
Come here, John. Run along, Pearl.
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
 Yes. Yes.
That wasn't very nice of you, John. Have a heart, boy.
Run along to bed.
Were you impudent to Mr. Powell, John?
Mom, I didn't mean --
What were you impudent about?
He asked me about the money again, Mom.
You always make up that lie, John! There is no money, John. Can't you get that through your head?
Meanest, orneriest, sneakinest critter in the whole river, boy! A gar!
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
No.
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
Never was much of a one for preachers myself. I dunno what's wrong up at your place, but just remember one thing, Cap -- if ever you need help you just holler out and come a- runnin'. Old Uncle Birdie's your friend.
There! You slimy, snag-toothed, egg- suckin', bait-stealin' so-and-so!
 Mind what I told you. If ever you get in a crack, I just come a-runnin'.
Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
I don't know.
 She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
I don't know nothin'!
The summer is young yet, little lad. (he turns away from John) Pearl?
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
Mm-hm.
I'll tell you a secret.
Yes?
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Yes?
Now it's your turn.
What secret shall I tell?
How old are you?
That's no secret. I'm five.
Sure, that's no secret.
 What's your name?
 You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
 You swore you wouldn't tell! (he beats the air with his fists) You swore! You swore! You swore!
 You hit Daddy with the hairbrush!
 You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
John's just plumb bad through and through --
 Yes, John's just plumb bad.
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
It's a shame!
Goodnight.
Goodnight, honey.
 Plan on a longer visit next time.
 You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
 I'm needed to keep peace and harmony between them.  It's my burden and I'm proud of it, Icey!
 John's bad.
 Yes; John's bad.
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
 O no! Your turn!
All right.
Where's the money hid.
John's bad.
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
 I didn't expect you home so soon.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
How do you mean?
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
About what!
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Walt!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Mother, I only --
 Are you through praying?
I'm through, Harry.
You were listening outside the parlor window.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
Answer me!
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
 Then the children know where it is hid? John knows? Is that it?  Then it's still here, somewhere amongst us, tainting us?
So you must have known it all along, Harry.
But that ain't why you married me, Harry. I know that much. It couldn't be that because the Lord just wouldn't let it.
He made you marry me so's you could show me the Way and the Life and the Salvation of my soul! Ain't that so, Harry?
So you might say it was the money that brung us together.
The rest of it don't matter, Harry.
Bless us all!
 Walt! Come quick!
 What's wrong, Mother?
 Sshhh! He's in there.
Who?
 Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
I'll be switched!...
Just went?
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
Is he hit pretty bad?
All to pieces!
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
A man of the Cloth?
Walt Spoon, that's for sickness in the house!
What can we do, Mother?
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
Mister Powell?
 A strange woman is a narrow pit!
 Amen! Amen!
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
 Mister Powell!
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
What could have possessed that girl!
 Satan.
Ah.
Didn't you have no inkling?
Yes; from the first night.
The first night?
Our honeymoon.
How's that?
She turned me out of the bed.
 Nnnoooo!!
What do you figure to do?
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
 Mmmmm!
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
I burned it. (Preacher holds out his hand, stares in disgust, and wipes his palm dramatically on his coatsleeve) I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
Amen.
The pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends.
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
 No!
Well, there's no harm in hopin'.
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
 How?
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
 What!
She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  She was drinking.
I tried to save her.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
The devil wins sometimes!
 Can't nobody say I didn't do my best to save her!
 Leaning! Leaning! Safe and secure from all alarms!
Leaning! Leaning! Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!  Children!
 Chill-dren?
John, why do we have to hide?
Careful...
Where's Mom?
She's gone to Moundsville.
To see Dad?
Yes, I reckon that's it.
 Children!
Someone is after us, Pearl.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Why?
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
No, that's just it. No.
Where are we goin', John?
Somewheres. I don't know yet.
I'm hungry, John.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
It'll spoil our supper.
 Pearl?
I hear you whisperin', children, so I know you're down there. I can feel myself gettin' awful mad, children.
 John...
My patience has run out, children. I'm comin' to find you now.
 Yoo-Hooooo! Mis-ter Paow-welll!
Just a little hot supper I fixed for you and the children.
Bless you, bless you!
And how are the children?
They're down there playin' games in the cellar and they won't mind me when I call 'em. I'm at my wit's end, Miz Spoon.
 John: Pearl:
John! Pearl! Shake a leg! (she claps her hands sharply)
 I won't have you worryin' poor Mister Powell another minute!
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.
Don't be too hard on 'em, Reverend. Poor motherless children.
Remember now Mister Powell, don't be afraid to call on us. Good night.
 Good night Miz Spoon, and thank you again.
Weren't you afraid, my little lambs, down there in all that dark?
They'll think it was me! They'll think it was old Uncle Birdie!
If you'd o' seen it, Bess! I'm drunk as a lord and I know it, but...
 Sweet Heaven, if you'd o' seen it!
 Down there in the deep place... her hair wavin' lazy and soft like meadow grass under flood waters and that slit in her throat just like she had an extry mouth.
 And there ain't mortal human I can tell but you...
 ...Bess, for if I go to the Law they'll hang it on to me.
Sweet Heaven save poor old Uncle Birdie!
 I'm hungry.
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
Can I have my supper please?
Naturally.
Can I have milk too?
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
 About our secrets.
No.
Why, pray tell?
Because John said I mustn't.
NEVER -- MIND -- WHAT -- JOHN -- SAID!
John is a meddler. Stop sniveling. Looky here a minute!
Know what this is?
Want to see something cute? Looky now!
How about that! This is what I use on meddlers.
John might be a meddler.
NO -- no, my lamb. Don't touch it! Now don't touch my knife! That makes me mad. Very, very mad.
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
 But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
JOHN -- DOESN'T -- MATTER! Can't I get that through your head, you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch!
There now! You made me lose my temper!
I'm sorry! I'm real sorry!
 Now! Where's it hid, honey?
 I'll tell.
 I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
 NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
 Well I declare! Sometimes I think poor John will make it to heaven yet!
All right boy: where's the money?
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
It'll go hard, boy, if I find you're lyin'.
I ain't lyin'. Go look for yourself.
All right... (he turns towards the door; then glances around) Come along.
What?
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
 You don't reckon I'd leave you.
 Don't you believe me?
 Why sure, boy, sure.
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
Yonder.
 O no you don't!
Now: Where?
 Under the stone in the floor.
This is concrete.
John made a Sin. John told a lie.
The Lord's a-talkin' to me now. He's a-sayin', "a liar is an abomination before mine eyes."
Speak, boy: Where's it hid? (the knife pricks the flesh under John's ear) Speak; before I cut your throat and leave you to drip like a hog hung up in butcherin' time!
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
You could save him, little bird.
 Inside my doll! Inside my doll!
In the doll! Why sure! Sure!
 The last place anyone would look!
 Chilll-dren?  The only reason I wanted that money is so's you could have it.
 The river. That's the only where! Uncle Birdie Steptoe!
 Puhr-urrl? Want your Mommy back?  Want me to get her right now?
 John?
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
 OPEN THAT DOOR, YOU SPAWN OF THE DEVIL'S OWN STRUMPET!
 Uncle Birdie! Uncle Birdie!
Uncle Birdie!
 Don't!
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!
It's me! John Harper and Pearl! You said to come a-runnin' if we needed you!
 Johnny!
Uncle -- Birdie! Oh -- please! Please wake up!
I never done it, boy. Sweet Heaven I never done such a terrible thing! I'll swear on the Book to it, boy! I never done it! I never!
 Lord save poor old Uncle Birdie Steptoe that never hurt a fly! 
 There's still the river. -- The skiff is down by the willows.
 Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
 John, where are we g --
Hush.
 Children?
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
 That's Daddy!
Wait, you little whelps! Wait!
Why can't I do it when I know how to do it!
Wait! Wait! I'll slit your guts!
Once upon a time there was a pretty fly, and he had a wife, this pretty fly...
 ...and one day she flew away, and then one night his two pretty fly children...
 ...flew away too, into the sky, into the moon...
 Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
Ain't got none.
 An ungrateful child is an abomination...
 ...before the eyes of God. The world is fast going to damnation because of impudent youngins a-flyin' in the face of Age.
 They make soup out of them...
 ...but I wouldn't know how to go about gettin' him open.
We're gonna spend a night on land.
Are we goin' home, John?
Ssh...
 Leaning, Leaning...
 ...safe and secure from all alarms;
Leaning...
 Leaning; Leaning on the Everlasting Arms.
 Don't you never sleep?
 Pearl, wake up! Come on, Pearl!
 You two youngsters get up here to me this instant!
 Mind me now!
 Now git on up to my house.
I'll git me a willow switch.
Don't you hurt her!
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
 Clary!
 Mary!
 Yes Miz Cooper!
Bring yer baskets.
Nicely picked, Clary. Mary; put the big ones on top. Ruby, most o' them ain't fit to go to market. Put them baskets down. Ruby, fetch the washtub and put it by the pump. Mary, Clary, fetch me a bar o' laundry soap and the scrub brush.
 Yes Miz Cooper!
Come on, now; up to the house.
Gracious! If you hain't a sight to beat all! Where you from?
Where's your folks?
 Speak up now!
 Gracious! So I've got two more mouths to feed!
Howdy Miz Cooper -- you goin' to sell me yer hog this year?
With the price o' pork what it is?
 I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage. (she calls to children over her shoulder) You-all have your work cut out!
She talks to herself.
All the time.
Your Maw's funny.
She ain't our Maw. We just live at her house.
Where's your folks?
Some place.
My Daddy's in Dee-troit.
 Who's your folks?
I dunno.
Mary! Honey! Mornin' Miz Cooper.  Guess what! I'm savin' up to buy ye a charm bracelet!
Never mind the gewgaws; don't you miss your visit this Sunday; and come to Church with us.
See ye Sunday, love!
Women is durn fools! All of 'em!
 Take yer baskets in.
 Looky there. (she indicates the lovers) She'll be losin' her mind to a tricky mouth and a full moon, and like as not I'll be saddled with the consequences.
 Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
She went.
John: you go fetch Ruby. (John goes. As Grocer empties baskets and tots up, Rachel continues:) Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
How 'bout tonight, Ruby?
 What gives?
The Old Lady's around.  How 'bout Thursday?
 The old gal thinks she comes in fer sewin' lessons o'-Thursday.
 Miz Cooper wants you.
 And will you show me your dolly, little lady?
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
 Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
 Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
Now old Pharoah, he was the King of Egyptland! And he had a daughter, and once upon a time  she was walkin' along the river bank and she seen somethin' bumpin' and scrapin' along down on a sandbar under the willows.
 And do you know what it was, children?
No!
 Well, now, it was a skiff, washed up on the bar. And who do you reckon was in it?
 Pearl and John!
 Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
 It was Moses! -- A King of men, Moses, children. Now. Off to bed. Hurry.
 John, git me an apple.
Git one for yourself, too.
 John, where's your folks?
 Dead.
Dead. 
Where ye from?
Up river.
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
Tell me that story again.
Story, honey? Why, what story?
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
I mind you said there was two.
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
Yes, come to think of it, there was two, John.
 Hey. Must be Thursday.
Here we go.
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Can I have this?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
O' course.
Watch out Preacher! Why, Preacher!
 Shet yer dirty mouths!
Ain't I purty?
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
 No. No one never did.
 There's two new ones over at your place, ain't there Ruby?
What's their names?
Pearl and John.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
 Only she won't never let me play with it.
Ahh!
 Yes!
Did you ever see such purty eyes in all your born days?
 Don't let him git away, Sugar!
He ain't like you-all! Next time I won't even ask him to buy me a sody!
I been bad!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
You'll whip me!
When did I ever?
This man down at the Drugstore...
The Drugstore?
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
What you been up to?
I been out with men.
Dear God, child!
You was lookin' for love, Ruby, the only foolish way you knowed how. (she lifts Ruby's face cheek to cheek beside her own) We all need love. Ruby, I lost the love of my son -- I've found it with you-all.
You must grow up to be a fine, full woman; and I'm goin' to see to it you do.
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
Now who was this?
He never asked me for nothin'.
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
What'd you all talk about?
Pearl and John.
John and Pearl!
Is he their Pap?
Why hasn't he been to the house?
 Miz Cooper!
 What?
The man! The man!
Mornin', ladies.
How'do.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
 It's about that John and that Pearl?
My little lambs! To think I never hoped to see them again in this world! Oh, dear Madam, if you was to know what a thorny crown I have borne in my search for these strayed chicks!
Ruby, go fetch them kids.
Ah, dear Madam, I see you're looking at my hands!
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
 It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
 Them kids is yours?
 My flesh and blood!
Where's your Missus?
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Where's she at?
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
She took them kids with her?
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
Are they well?
A sight better than they was.
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
The Lord will provide.
 The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
What's wrong, John?
Nothin'. 
 Come to me, boy!
What's wrong, John?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
He ain't my Dad.
He ain't no Preacher neither. I've seen Preachers in my time, an' some of 'em was saints on earth. A few was crookeder'n a dog's hind leg, but this 'un's got 'em all beat for badness.
Just march yourself yonder to your horse, Mister.
March, Mister! I'm not foolin'.
 You ain't done with Harry Powell yet! The Lord God Jehovah will guide my hand in vengeance! You devils! You Whores of Babylon! I'll come back when it's dark!
Moonin' around the house over that mad dog of a Preacher! Shame, Ruby!
Merciful Heaven!
Ruby, get the children out of bed. Bring them all down here to the kitchen.
Women is such fools!
It's a hard world for little things.
 Children, I got lonesome. I figgered we might play games.
Won't you tell us a story?
I might (a swift furious glance into the moonlight) I might tell a story.
I'll light the lamp.
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
Well... mind what I told you about little Jesus and his Ma and Pa and how there was No Room at the Inn?
Well now, there was this sneakin', no-'count, ornery King Herod!
And he heard tell of this little King Jesus growin' up and old Herod figgered: Well, shoot! There sure won't be no room for the both of us!  I'll just nip this in the bud.
 Well, he never knowed for sure which one of all them babies of the land was King Jesus.
And so that cursed old King Herod figgered if he was to kill all the babies in the land, he'd be sure to get little Jesus.
 And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
They hid in a broom closet!
They hid under the porch!
No; they went a-runnin'.
Well now, John, that's just what they done! They went a-runnin!
 Figured I was gone, eh?
 Run hide in the staircase! Run quick!
 Ruby, git.
 What do you want?
 Them kids!
 What are you after them for?
 None of your business, Madam.
I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this kitchen shootin'!
Miz Booher? Rachel Cooper. Git them State Troopers out to my place. I done treed somep'n up in my barn.
I'll see to Pearl.
I'll make coffee.
She's all right.
John, you know? When you're little you have more endurance than God is ever to grant you again? Children are Man at his strongest. They abide.
 Is that him, Ma'am?
 Yes! Mind where you shoot, boys! There's children here!
Whyn't you call us up before?
Didn't want yer big feet trackin' up my clean floors.
 Harry Powell, you're under arrest for the murder of Willa Harper!
 Don't!
 Don't!
 Dad!
John! John!
Here! Here! Take it back! I can't stand it, Dad! It's too much, Dad! I don't want it! I can't do it! Here! Here!
 Lynch him! Lynch him!
 Bluebeard!
 Twenty-five wives!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
 If the People of Marshall County...
 Bluebeard! Bluebeard!
 Will you identify the prisoner?
 Please, little lad. Won't you look yonder... (his pointing finger enters the shot. John shakes as if he had a cold) ...and tell the Court if that is the man who killed your mother?
 It's all right, Mrs. Cooper. You can take the little fellow away.
Merry Christmas to you and yours, Mrs. Cooper.
 And what's Santy Claus going to bring you, little man?
 O-ho-oo-o!
 Them is the ones he sinned against, my friends!
 Bluebeard! Bluebeard!
 Bluebeard! Bluebeard!
 Them's hers!
Them's her orphans!
Where's Ruby?
She went.
Them poor little lambs!
Them's the ones he sinned against, my friends!
 Go out the back way, Miz Cooper.
Ain't we goin' to the Bus Depot?
 Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
 Come on!
 He lied!
Tricked us!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
 Lynch him! String him up!
I love him!
He loves me because I'm so purty! You think he's like them others!
 You took on something awful about him buying me that there movie book. You was so mad you shot him and the blue men took him.
 Hey Bart!
Yeah?
 We're savin' this bird up fer you!
This time it'll be a privilege.
 Bust the door down!
 They'll git him out. I'll git my things ready -- my shawl and my Mickey Mouse wristwatch that don't run and the straw hat with the flower, and we'll be married and live happily ever after!
 Bust the door down! Set fahr to it! Where's that axe! Climb up on the balcony! You six git 'round to the back!
 People of Marshall County!
Nothing!
I'm glad they didn't send me nothing! Whenever they do it's never nothing I want but something to show me how fancy and smart they've come up in the world.
Can we give you your presents now?
Shoot! You don't mean to say you got me a present!
Shoot now!
 Why, Ruby!
 A POT-HOLDER!
 And much neater than last year's, Ruby! (Sound of tearing gift-paper o.s.)  And Clary! ANOTHER POT-HOLDER! Ain't that thoughtful. I'm always burnin' my hands.
And did you two make this together?
You hop us, some.
 John, that's the richest gift a body could have.  You'll find your presents in the cupboard under the china-closet.
You know where, Ruby.
Ruby: (she takes a box from her apron pocket) This is yours.
Lord save little children!  You'd think the world would be ashamed to name such a day as Christmas for one of them...  ...and go on the same old way.  My soul is humble when I see the way little ones accept their lot.  Lord save little children! The wind blows and the rain is cold. Yet, they abide.
 For every child, rich or poor there's a time of running through a dark place; and there's no word for a child's fear. A child sees a shadow on the wall, and sees a Tiger. And the old ones say, "There's no tiger; go to sleep." And when that child sleeps, it's a Tiger's sleep, and a Tiger's night, and a Tiger's breathing on the windowpane. Lord save little children!
That watch sure is a fine, loud ticker!
It'll be nice to have someone around the house who can give me the right time of day.
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
I ain't afraid no more! I got a watch that ticks! I got a watch that shines in the dark!
 They abide and they endure.
