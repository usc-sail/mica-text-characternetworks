They say that some elementary school kid spent the night with his parents at a bed and breakfast in Izu.  The kid wanted to go out and play with everybody, right, but he didnt want to miss the program he always used to watch back in Tokyo, so he records it on the VCR in their room.  But of course the stations in Izu are different from the ones in Tokyo.  In Izu, it was just an empty channel, so he shouldve recorded nothing but static.  But when the kid gets back to his house and watches the tape, all of a sudden this woman comes on the screen and says--
One week from now, you will die.
Of course the kids completely freaked, and he stops the video. Just then the phone rings, and when he picks it up a voice says--
You watched it, didnt you?  That same time, exactly one week later... hes dead!
What is it, Tomoko?
Who did you hear that story from?
Who?  Its just a rumor.  Everybody knows it.
Youko told you?
No, it wasnt Youko...
Whats up with you?
The other day, I... I watched this strange video.
Where?
With Youko and them.
 So thats what Ive been hearing about you doing some double-date/ sleepover thing!  So, you and that guy Iwata, huh?
No, its not like that.  Nothing happened!
Iwata... he found this weird video. Everyone was like, Whats that? so he put it on and we all watched it.
 And?  What kind of video was it?
Just... weird, I cant really explain it.  Anyway, right after we finished watching it, the phone rang.  Whoever it was didnt say anything, but still...
Jesus.
It's cuz, you know, we'd all heard the rumors.
That was one week ago today.
Waaait a minute.  Are you faking me out?
Busted, huh?
Oh, my... I cant believe you!
Youre terrible!
Gotcha!
 But hang on... you really stayed the night with Youko and Iwata, right?
So, how far did you and he get?
Oh... I cant remember.
You cant remember, huh?
Man, you had me freaked me out. I--
 Was it true?
Masami!
Masami!
Ill put her on.
 Yes?
Oh, man!
 Yeah, Ive got a friend over now. Yeah.  Yeah, OK.  Bye.
The games gone into overtime, so theyre gonna be a little late.
Jeeezus, my parents...
Oh man, Im tellin everybody about this tomorrow!
Im gonna use your bathroom.  Dont go anywhere.
K.
There seems to be a popular rumor going around about a cursed videotape.
Uh-huh.
Have you heard what kind of video it might be?
Uh-huh.
Uh, dont look right at the camera, OK?
Sorry.
Lets do it again.
Have you heard what kind of video it might be?
What I heard was, all of a sudden this scaaarry lady comes on the screen and says, In one week, you will die.
I heard that if youre watching TV late at night itll come on, and then your phonell ring.
Watching TV late at night... do you know what station?
Mmmm... I heard some local station, around Izu.
Izu?
Mmm-hmm.
And, do you know if anyones really died from watching it?
Well, no one that we know, right?
What is it?
I heard this from a friend of mine in high school.  She said that there was this one girl who watched the video, and then died a week later. She was out on a drive with her boyfriend.
They were in a wreck?
No, their car was parked, but they were both dead inside.  Her boyfriend died because hed watched the video, too.  Thats what my friend said.
Its true!  It was in the paper two or three days ago.
Do you know the name of the high school this girl went to?
No... I heard this from my friend, and it didnt happen at her school. She heard it from a friend at a different school, she said.
Mrs. Asakawa?
Hm?
Here you are.
 Thanks.
This same kind of thing happened about ten years ago too, didnt it? Some popular young singer committed suicide, and then suddenly there was all this talk about her ghost showing up on some music show.
But I wonder what this rumors all about. Everyone you ask always mentions Izu.
Maybe thats where it all started. Hey, where was that Kuchi-sake Onna * story from again?
Gifu, but there was some big accident out there, and that ended up being what started the rumor.
A big accident?
Mmm-hmm.  Something terrible like that is going to stay in peoples minds.  Sometimes the story of what happened gets twisted around, and ends up coming back as a rumor like this one. Thats what they say, at least.
Dyou think something like that happened out at Izu?
Maybe. Well, anyway, Im off.  See you tomorrow.
See you.
Yessir.
Miss Asakawa?  I thought you were going home early today.
Okazaki, can I ask you a favor?
Sure.
Could you check out this article for me?  Get me some more info.?
I guess...
Good.  Call me as soon as you know more, OK?
Maam.
Yoichi!
Sorry Im late.  Oh, youve already changed.
Yup.
I got your clothes out for you.
Aargh, weve gotta hurry!
Did grandpa call?
Nope.
Why did Tomo-chan die? *
Well... it looks like she was really, really sick.
Will you do me up?
You can die even if youre young?
If its something serious... well, yes.
As hard as it is for us, what your auntie and uncle are going through right now is even harder, so lets not talk about this over there, OK?
 You and her used to play a lot together, didnt you?
Dad.
Ah!
How is sis holding up?
Shes resting inside right now. Shes shaken up pretty badly, you know.  Its best she just take things easy for a while.
Ill go check on auntie and them, then.
OK.  Ah, Yoichi.  Why dont you sit here for a little while?
Have you heard anything more about Tomo-chans death?
No, I...
But the police have already finished their autopsy!
Well, they said there was no sign of foul play.
 That was no normal death.  They havent once opened the casket to let us see the body.  Dont you think thats strange?
Yoichi?
What are you doing up here?  You shouldnt just walk into other peoples rooms.
You go on downstairs, OK?
OK.
 You go on ahead.
K.
Hello?
Uh... this is Okazaki.  Ive got some more info on that article for you.  The girl was a student of the uh, Seikei School for Women in Yokahama City.
 Thanks.
Excuse me.  This is, um, kind of a strange question, but by any chance were you friends of that young girl that died in the car as well?
Please.  If you know anything...
They all died the same day.  Youko. Tomoko.  Even Iwata, he was in a motorcycle accident.
Because they watched the video.
Video?
Thats what Youko said.  They all watched some weird video, and after that their phone rang.
Tomoko-chan watched it, too? Where?
She just said they all stayed somewhere.
There was a girl with Tomoko when she died.  Shes had to be hospitalized for shock.
They say she wont go anywhere near a television.
The bodies of those found were Tsuji Youko, age 17, a student of the Seikei School for Women, and Nomi Takehiko, age 19, preparatory school student.  Both their doors were securely locked.
This is the first time Ive -ever- seen something like this.
Cause of death?
Couldnt say, aside from sudden heart failure.
Drugs?
The autopsy came up negative.
These two, about to go at it, suddenly up and die for no apparent reason.
Do -you- get it?
They tell me that Yoichi came to the funeral, too.
Mmm-hmm.
They used to play a lot together, didnt they?  Upstairs.
Yeah...
 This... this is where Tomoko died.
RYOMI Tomoko!
Izu...
Look, Im probably going to be late coming home tonight, so just stick your dinner in the microwave when youre ready to eat, OK?
K... Mom?
Hmm?
Tomo-chan watched some cursed video!
What did you say?  You are not to speak of this at school, do you hear me?
 I wont.  Im going to school now.
Theres no way...
"My dad is fat.  My mom is fat. Thats why Im fat, too."
Room for one?
Um, actually Im here on business.
They would have stayed here on August 29th, all four of them. If theres any information you might have...
Uh, hang on just a minute.
 August 29th...
That...
Hmm?
That!  What tape is that?
This?  Hmm...
Maybe one of the guests left it behind
 One week
Yoichis in elementary school already, is he?
His first year.  What about you, Ryuji?  How have you been recently?
Same as always.
And money is...?
Im teaching at university.
Anyway.  You said that the phone rang?
Thats right.
So if I watch it too, that phone over there--
--should ring.
Ryuji, four people have already died.  On the same day!
 Well, why dont you try calling an exorcist?
Take my picture.
Turn this way.
 Hurry up and take it.
Its over.
Well, it looks like your phones not ringing.
Make me a copy of this, will you? Id like to do a little research of my own. Theres no reason to write us off as dead just yet.
If theres a video, that means that somebody had to make it.
Theres the guest list from the cottage to look into... and the possibility of someone hacking into the local stations broadcast signals.
 Heres that guest list you wanted.
Oh, thanks.
What are you gonna do with this?
Uh... sorry, Im working on something personal.
So, it was you.  You did it.
Hey.
What happened to you?
 Nothing.
So, whatd you come up with?
I dont think any of the guests on the list brought the tape with them. I couldnt confirm it face-to-face of course, but even over the phone I got the feeling they were all being upfront with me.
How about the other angle?  Pirate signals or...
Therere no traces of any illegal television signals being broadcast around Izu.
Heres that copy of the videotape you wanted.
 Asakawa.
Have you ever seen this woman?
No...
 Theres something strange about this shot.
From this angle, the mirror should be reflecting whoevers filming.
So, what does that mean?
Well, if the person who made this is a pro, thered be a way around that, I guess, but still...
 Volcanic eruption... Eruption where?
This is gonna be impossible to figure out on just a regular TV screen, dont you think?
Come on in.
Asakawa, meet my student, Takano Mai.
This is Asakawa, my ex-wife.
Nice to meet you.  Im Takano.
Asakawa. *
Sensei, the people from the publishing company called about the deadline on your thesis again.
 Whatre they talkin to you about it for?
Because they can never get a hold of you.
Ask them to wait another week.
Sensei, ask them yourself, please.
OK, OK.
This is impossible.
Sada...
Is Yoichi gonna be all right?
 Hes used to it...
Whoever made this had to have left some kind of clue behind.  Theyre probably waiting for us to find it.
Wait a minute.
Shoooomonnn bakkkkkarrri toou... boooouuuukonn ga kuuru zouuu...
 Shoumon bakkari, boukon ga kuru zo.  Did you hear that, too?
What does that mean?
Im gonna check it out.
Hello?
Ive got it.  Its a dialect, just like I thought.  SHOUMON means playing in the water and BOUKON means monster. *
But, dialect from where?
Oshima.  And the site of our eruption is Mt. Mihara.
 Yoichi?  Im gonna be a little late tonight, honey.
You can do it yourself, right?  OK. Sorry.  Bye.
Ive got it!  This old article...
What are you doing?
Has your newspaper got someone out there at Oshima?
I think so.  There should be a correspondent out there.
I need you to find out, and let me know how to get hold of him. Tonight.
What do you think youre--?
 Youve only got four days left, Asakawa!  Your newspaper contact and I can handle this from here on out.  You just stay with Yoichi.
Grandpa!
Whoa, there!  So, you made it, huh?
Yoichi says hes looking forward to doing some fishing with you.
Is that so?
Cmon grandpa, lets go!
OK, OK.  Well get our things together and then we can go.
There he is!  Cmon, there he is, dont let him go!
Oh, oh!  Ah... guess he got away, huh?
That was your fault, grandpa.
Well, whaddya say we try again?
Well get im this time.
 How was work, mommy?
Hello?
Yeah.  Your Oshima contact came through.  It looks like the woman who predicted the Mihara eruption is the same woman from the video.
Her name is Yamamura Shizuko.  She committed suicide forty years ago by throwing herself into Mt. Mihara.
Have you got anything else?
Im gonna have to check it for myself.  Ill be leaving for Oshima tomorrow morning.
Oshima?  Ive only got three days left!
I know.  And Ive got four.
Ill be in touch.
Whats happened?
Nothing.  I just had some things left over from work.
Auntie?
Yoichi?
Yoichi!  You brought this with you, didnt you?  Why?!?
Tomo-chan...
Tomo-chan told me to watch it.
I shouldve been more careful. When I was at your place that day, I could feel something there.  I thought it was just because of the video...
You mean that Tomoko
Thats not Tomoko.  Not anymore.
Yoichi... he can see them too, cant he?
Its all my fault.  First Tomoko died, then those three others.  It should have stopped there, but it didnt.  Because of me.
I wonder...
How did the rumors about the video even start in the first place?
This kind of thing... it doesnt start by one person telling a story.  Its more like everyones fear just takes on a life of its own.
Fear...
Or maybe its not fear at all. Maybe its what we were secretly hoping for all along.
Mr. Hayatsu?
Aah, welcome!  You must be tired after your long trip.  Please, this way.
Back in the old days, the Yamamuras used to head fishing boats out in Sashikiji, though they dont much anymore.  You know, one of Shizukos cousins is still alive. Hes just an old man now.  His son and his daughter-in-law run an old-fashioned inn.  I went ahead and booked reservations for yall, hope thats alright...
 Why did Yamamura Shizuko commit suicide?
She was taking a real beating in the press, being called a fraud and all sorts of names. After a while she just lost it.
Shizuko was getting a lot of attention around the island after predicting the eruption of Mt. Mihara.  Seems that for some time shed had a rather unique ability: precognition. It was around then that she attracted the attention of a certain scholar whom you may have heard of; Ikuma Heihachiro.
He was driven out of the university, wasnt he?
This Professor Ikuma convinces Shizuko to go to Tokyo with him, where he uses her in a series of demonstrations meant to prove the existence of ESP.  At first shes the darling of the press, but the next thing you know theyre knocking her down, calling her a fraud.  Hmph.  Forty years later, the media still hasnt changed that much.
Ive heard this story.  But... Im sure I remember hearing that somebody died at one of those demonstrations.
After getting kicked out of university, Ikuma just vanished, and no ones been able to get hold of him since.  Hes probably not even alive anymore.
But, why even try looking for him?
Because hes supposed to have had a child with Shizuko.  A daughter.
Hello?
Thank you.
Welcome.
Well, Ill be off then.
Please.
And for your rooms, how shall we...?
Separate, please.
Sir.
This way.
 Sir!
 Please, this way.
Please!  If you could just answer a few questions, about Shizuko...
I got nuthin to say.
Its about Shizukos daughter.
She did have a daughter, didnt she?
Youre wasting your time.
Arent you gonna eat?
Umm...
Hm?
Youll stay with me wont you? When its time for me to die.
Oh, stop it.
Youll stay, wont you?  If you stayed, maybe youd learn something that could help Yoichi--
I said stop it!  Have you forgotten There was a girl with Tomoko when she died?  That girls now in a mental institution.  Who knows what could happen.
But you could stay with me, Ryuji. Youd be OK.
 Why, because Im already not right in the head?
If thats the case, why not just let things run its course, get rid of father -and- son?  Yoichi was a mistake, anyway.
Stop it!
We still have two days left...
Excuse me?
Come in.
Its about Miss Shizuko.
This is all that there is...
Is this Professor Ikuma?
...yes.  This picture is from before Id entered the household.
I should go now.
Shoumon bakkari... boukon ga kuru zo...
Yalld do best to be off soon. Seas probably gonna be rough tonight.
What kind of a child was Shizuko?
Shizuko was... different.  Shed come out here by herself everday an just stare out at the ocean.  The fishermen all took a dislikin to her.  Oceans an unlucky place for us, ysee: every year it swallows up more of our own. You keep starin out at somethin ike that...
Shoumon bakkari shiteru to, boukon ga kuru zo.  If you keep playing in the water, the monster will come for you.
Shizuko could see inside people, couldnt she?  Down to the places theyd most like to keep hidden.  It must have been difficult for her...
Please leave!  Now!
Ive got a little of that ability myself.  It was you who spread the word about Shizuko, wasnt it? And you who first contacted Professor Ikuma?
Whatre you--?
You thought youd be able to make some money off her.  You even got some, from one of the newspapers.
Leave me the hell alone!
Tell us about Shizukos daughter. Who was she?
I dont know!
She was there, with Shizuko. She had to be.
 You were there!
You stood there and watched the demonstration.
Match.
Match.
Faker!  This is nothing but trickery, and the lowest form of trickery at that.
What are you trying to pull, woman?
Thats right!  Professor Ikuma, youre being fooled!
Whats happened?
Hes dead!
 Witch!
Sadako?  Was it you?
Sadako?!
Sadako killed him?  She can kill just with a thought?
Shes... a devil spawn.
Thats right. After Yamamura Shizuko committed suicide, Professor Ikuma took the daughter and ran.  No, no one knows where they went.  Thats why I need -you- to find out where they are. Even if the professors dead, Sadako should still be in her forties.  Ill explain it all later, but right now just hurry!
Sadakos probably already dead.  She could kill people with just a thought, remember?  Her mother wasnt even close to that.
 Well, what about that video?  If Sadakos dead then who made it?
Nobody made it. It wasnt made at all. That video... is the pure, physical manifestation of Sadakos hatred.
Weve been cursed.
Its no good.  With the typhoon coming in, all ships are temporarily staying docked.
What about the fishing boats? Tell their captains Ill pay.
Fishing boats?  Sir, without knowing whether this typhoon is going to hit us or not, I think itd be better to wait and see how things turn--
Fine!  Ill try searching myself!
Mr. Takayama!?  Mr. Takayama...
Hello?
Mrs. Asakawa?  Im sorry.  I tried, but I couldnt come up with any leads at all.
Hello?
 Thank you...
Yoichi...
 Izu...
 Ryuji!
Ryuji!  The phone in my apartment never rang!  It only ever rang at the rental cottage!  Professor Ikuma mustve...
And weve got no way of going back.
Its too dangerous!  The thought of anybody going out in this weather...
Ill take you out.
Sadako is callin yall, reckon. Mayhap to drag you down under the water.
Please.  Take us out.
Its funny.  Im not afraid at all.
Sadako probably died back out there at Izu, before the rental cottages were ever built.
So, Sadako was Professor Ikumas daughter?
 Ikuma smuggled her out in secret. His relationship with Shizuko was already a scandal, and one of the reasons he got drummed out of the university... Weve gotta find Sadakos body.
 Is that going to break the curse? Will Yoichi be all right?
Its all weve got left to try.
Just one more day...
We made it.  Maybe Sadako doesnt have it out for us after all.
Shizuko... she used to -speak- to the ocean, just ramble away.  One time I hid, listenin to one of her conversations.
And it werent in no human language.
Hello?
Yoichi?  Its mommy.  I just called to say Ill be coming home tomorrow.
Im tired of it here, mom!  I wanna go back to school.
 Yoichi, its rude to your grandpa to talk like that.
Hes laughing.  You wanna talk to him?
No, thats...
Im sorry, Yoichi.  Ill... Ill see you tomorrow.
Whats wrong?
Mommys got something she has to do. Say hello to grandpa for me, OK?
What time was it when you first watched the video?
Seven or eight minutes past seven.  PM.  No more than ten minutes past.
If the rumors are true, that time is gonna be our deadline.
-Here-.
I knew it!  The well.
The well...
Her own father!
It was Ikuma who put this lid on. And Sadakos still inside.
Ill go.
Sadako was alive!  Shed tried to climb her way out.
Lower the buckets!
Take it up!
Take it up!
Its already six!
 I know!  Hurry up and TAKE IT UP!!
Take it up!
Asakawa!
 What the hell are you doing?  Trying to get me killed?
Hey!
Asakawa!
Well change.  Youre in no condition to keep this up.
No!
Who do you expect to pull up these buckets, then?
But, we dont even know if its doing any good...
And what about Yoichi, huh?  Is his mother not coming to pick him up after all?
Dont look down!
Where are you?  Please, come out.
Please.  Where are you?
Its you...
Hey!  Asakawa!  Its already 10 minutes past seven!  We did it!
Why would Ikuma have killed her? His own daughter...
Maybe she wasnt his daughter at all.
What?
Maybe her father... wasnt even human.
Its gone...
Enough, already.  Its over.  Cmon. Ill take you home.
Get some rest.
I still have a thesis to finish.
...thank you.
That girl...
 Why?!
Thats it!  Asakawa...
Aaargh!
Are you a resident here, maam?
Im Takayama Ryujis wife!
Im sorry maam, but theyve already taken the body away.
What happened?
When I got here he was just lying there...
Did he say anything to you?  About a videotape?
His face...
Ryuji... why?  Does this mean that Yoichi will die, too?  Is the curse not broken yet?
I was the only one to break Sadakos curse.  Ryuji... why...? Something I did that you didnt... Something I did that you didnt...
Ryuji?!
Something I did that you didnt...
What broke the curse was that I copied the tape and showed it to someone else!
Dad?  Its me.  Im on my way over. Look, dad, Ive got something to ask. Its for Yoichi...
They say theres a way you can stay alive after you watch the video. Youve gotta make a copy of it, and show it to somebody else inside a week.
But what about the person you show it to?
Well, then they make a copy and show it to somebody else.  Again, inside a week.
 Then theres no end to it.
Thats just it.  There -is- no end.  But if it meant not dying... youd do it, wouldnt you?
