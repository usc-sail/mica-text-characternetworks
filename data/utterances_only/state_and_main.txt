You hear that?
Yes, I hear it.
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an-hour, get across the street yesterday.
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
Y'wanna fix something, you should fix the pothole.  Yessir, they should be trussed up, thrown off some high building.
Who's that?
Whoever spent ten, f'teen thousand dollars, a new traffic light, you could grow old, paint your house before it lets you cross the street, and then, not fix the pothole.
What was wrong with the old traffic light?
I'm glad you asked... I'll tell you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now: You want to bring business into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, no...
Morning, darling.
Morning.
Hi, Annie.
Morning, Carla.
...the damn thing...
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
They are, yes.  I'm sure they are...
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
...I'm sure that people are upset...
I know 'em, I don't know what order they come in...
We'll work it out.
What're they talking about?
Traffic light.
Waal, no, th'traffic light's Doug's thing.  That's his thing, fine.
Thank you, Jack, and...
But we got to talk about the pothole.
Jack...
A public office is a public trust... This is why this is America.  Question is: who owns the street.
Doc, those pills, y'gave me for my back? I'm not sure that they work.
Well, I'm not sure either, but y'don't hear me complain... come by th'office, end of th'afternoon.
Thanks, Doc...
This is your movie, this is small town America.
Town in New Hampshire was small town America, too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And then they kicked us out...
A jacket for five dollars... I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
You told me that about the last town.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm bleeding...
...why am I here?
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill?
"The Waterford Mill, built in 1825, and long a tourist attraction..." Wake up Uberto
Where are we?
Givvem a cigarette...
...they ship our Old Mill from New Hampshire?
They're holding our Old Mill for ransom.
We build it?
We don't have to build it.
We build the fire hut?
We have to lose the window.
...we can't lose the wind...
 Then I can't do this shot... you wants me to push in -- I can't push in through the window... we go back to New Hampshire?
NO, we can't ever go back to New Hampshire.
NO, we're gonna stay here.  This is what my people died for.  The right to make a movie in this town.
May I help you?
 I want to talk to the manager.
Would you like a room?
Na, we wanna rent the whole hotel.
 Hello, Tracy, we gotta new town. We're...where are we?
 Waterford, Vermont.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
I will.
 Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it? That's where it is...
 Because, because...we don't have to build an Old Mill.  They have an Old Mill.  Yeah.  It's on a stream -- that's where you put a mill.
...they run on water.
 Now: I'm looking at the...
I've got scene twelve...  Shouldn't you be in school?
It's night.
 Scene twelve...arrival at the mill.
Mr. Price, Mr. Price...? 
What...?
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie in..."
I'll put the, in your r...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bab Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
That's cor...
 He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
14-year old girls.
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
 I, I'm sor... (as the door closes, to a passing aide) ...I lost my typewriter...
Hi, Mr. Bailey...
Carla, would you tell them that I'm...
 What?  What is it?
Could I speak to my wife, please?
 You've got a call...
And Uberto tells me he can't take this shot, unless they let him take out the firehouse window.
Walt, I've got to talk to you about the nude scene.
Aren't you ever in school?
There's other things to be learned.
Izzat so?
The Mayor's outside.
What's his name?
Mr. Bailey.
Mr. Bailey...Mr. Bailey...?
 I lost my typewriter...?
 Yes, could I please speak to my wife...?
I have to tell you, I can not express to you how happy...
And we're glad to have you here...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer... would you like a cigar?
 Aren't these illegal?
Why would they be illegal?
...there's a trade embargo against Cuba.
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
That's very kind of...as a matter-of fact, one, I hate to bother you with...
...not at all...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
Whatever you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
...the city council...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
...it is?
I am the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
George, that is so kind of you.
And, my wife wanted to, wanted me to ask you, we'd like to welcome you, we'd, she'd like to have you to dinner at our home.  I don't mean to be...
Are you kidding me?  We would be delighted.
Well, I won't take more of your time...
Walt, it's Marty on the Coast...
We'll see you Tuesday, then...
It's one of the great, great pleasures meeting you...
It's Marty on the Coast.
On the coast?  Of course he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the Hague?
 What?  Marty?!  Hi.  We're...  The new town is cheaper than the other town.  We're going to save a for...because..because we don't have to rebuild the Old Mill, they've got an Old Mill...they've got a firehouse...they...
Baby, baby, I want to save the money just as much as you do...no, no it's not coming out of my pocket.  It's going into my pock...my...my and your pock...yeah?  Okay.  A product placement - tell me ab...he's going through a tunnel.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, you wiped out the board.  DINNER WITH THE MAYOR, TUESDAY NIGHT, write it in red.  That's all we need, to miss Dinner with...
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
 Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we want.
It burnt down.
When did it burn down?
Nineteen-sixty.  "Part of a spate of suspicious fires, the Old Mill, the..."
You told me they had on Old Mill here...
"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed teenager were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
Hi.
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
 You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
The Mill burnt down.
Wonderful scr...
 Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
We're out of money.
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire.
They're holding it for ransom.
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
Halo?  Marty?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying?
I can't write it.
I lost my typewriter.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I can only write on a manual.
I know the feeling.
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
Grace...
That's a real fault, I...
Grace.  Get Mr. White a manual typewriter.  It's not a lie, it's a gift for fiction. And somebody find me my lucky pillow.
How big is this horse?
 Fifteen hands.
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
This horse is booked.
Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an associate producer credit.
Well, no, the labor with a first child can sometimes be prolonged, as much as...
 Find Walt's lucky pillow.
What's an associate producer credit?
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
...put a VHS and an air-conditioner and a refrigerator in that room, she's going to blow...
This isn't Evian Water.
It's water.
I can't sign for it, I'm...
...she's going to blow.
Well, you re-wire...
I rewire it, I'm going to have to tear out half the, look, what do they need with fifty-four telephone lines?
Freddy, Freddy, I work for these people, you...it is to be done, you see that it's done...
I found lilacs!
Wonderful, that's...
Did they find...
 Did they find my typewriter...
I told you!!!  All of you get back!!! Get back!!!  This man is a guest here!
Hello, I'm...
Oh, sir, I know who you are...
Bob Barrenger, I'm with the mo...
Sir, sir, we're so, we're...  Front!  Front!!  We are so, I've seen, I know everybody says this, but I've seen every every one of your...  Freddy, take Mr...
...I'm working.
Your room is 414 through seventeen.  I'm Scott Larkin.  Anything you need, this is my private... 
Glad to meet you, Scottie.  I'm just here to do a job, just like the rest of these...
 Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
That's right.
You know who the father is?
They think it's your first wife.
That could be.
 I'm going to give you a list of Mr. Barrenger's dietary requirements.
Mr. Barrenger, I...
Not today, not today, Chuckie.  Mr. Barrenger has just...
 How do you spell that, son?  With an I.E.?  Chuck?  What're your hobbies?
Baseball.
Baseball!  That's the national sport. Gimme that!
Chuckie...
How you doin' with the Old Mill pages?
I need my typewriter.  Did they find my...?
Coffee Corner.
Fellow gets a calf, it's forty below, calf gets out, he hears that animal, he's going to, get up, pull on his jeans...
He's going to get that calf.
Mmm...
 Thank you. (hangs up, to her father who is behind the grill) Vanilla Frappe.  Two tuna B.L.T.'s...
What's a Tuna B.L.T.?
Oh, Dad, didn't you read in People Magazine...
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here.
What I am saying, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own... Now: they want to close down Main Street.
Y'wanna talk about Main Street, whyn't cha fix the pothole?
Doug, it's, what did you...?  Three days, three, four days.  We'll have a record of our wonderful life.
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life  s'no less a commodity than...than our...
Water or mineral deposits.
Waal, that's what I'm saying.
Communist Country, he hears that Calf it's two a.m., four feet of snow, what does he say?  "That's the State's Calf out there..."  He rolls over.  "Wake me at Ten."
I think that they're nice.
I'm sure they are.
That's the difference, Communism and you know...
Communism's over.
That's what they said about Warner Brothers, 1985, but if you look at their price-per-share...
Dad, I've got to go to Terry's house to study tonight...
I want you home by Nine.
I want to tell you something, Ann: you stay soft all your life, people despise you; it awakens Avarice in them, they take advantage of you, and that's Human Nature.
We on for tomorrow night?
After Drama Group.
Drama Group? and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Go you Huskies.
And I might have something important to tell you...
What is it, a surprise?
That's right.
She coulda done better than him.
It takes all kinds.
Zat what it takes?  I always wondered what it took...
I, excuse me, the sign says you'll be back at two.  It's quarter to three...
 You're doing a play...
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too, Marge.
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
Everybody makes their own fun. (she answers another phone call) F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
 Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
I need a
We got 'em.  North...No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was the criminal.  Yep, you came to the right place.  Jessie James was the Brother.  Of the novelist.  That's right.  That's alright, Susie.  See you tomorrow, Susie.
I want to rent this one.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
I have one, but they lost it.
Who?
The people in New Hampshire.
 That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
Well, it had sentimental value.
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
You wrote a play on it?  What play is that?
You haven't heard of it.
What's it called?
"Anguish."
"Anguish" by Joseph Turner White...?
You're Joseph Turner White?
Afternoon, Ann.
Maude, this man wrote this play!
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a very good play.
Well, then, what's he doing here?
What're you doing here?
Writing the movie.
You're writing a movie...
Yes.
What's it about?
It's about the quest for purity.
...because he wouldn't say that: Look: (flips through the script, reads) "Sister, I've just come from a fire. There's some things I want to think out..." now, come one, come on... "Leave me alone."  a gesture...?  Alright?
What else?
Page...three.  Now: "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that..."It's a nice..."
Come in.
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
I grew up on your mov...
Do you mind if we don't go through the usual bullshit about how I loved it?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion Picture.
Thanks, honey, but next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
The people came to see a motion Picture.  Hold on...
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Tell it with...
Tell it with pictures.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
We've got four days to...
You look at: girl comes in the room, an apron, a brown bag, what is she...? She's a...?
She's a...
She's a waitress.
What...
What I...
Hold on.  What Bob is saying, you don't need...
You don't need, "Hi, I've just come from the restaurant."
 You can go...
Alright: Let's (he takes out a list, Carla exits) Page five, the fucking horse dies.  You know, she could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, wife...?  It could be his...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
No, you're absolutely...
And you go start with that stuff in this town...
Everybody needs a hobby.  Okay, look Page...
 Claire, when did you...
I just...
Claire, Bob Bar...
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
No, I was, I was, I was just learning on, it's a...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
I loved it, he...
Isn't he...
It's...
We're just talking about the...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
No, no...please...
I'm looking at Page Five: "It's..."
"It's a nice evening..."
This is Joe White.
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a... what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
Joe's been having some thoughts about the Old Mill Scene, Claire.
What, what's there to think about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
Yes, but, Joe, Joe's been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "thoughts," about...
How many times in your life do you get a speech like that?
Yeah.
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...half of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
Yes, yes, but...
"...but still it rises up.  It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
 All ready to go?
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
I beg your pardon?
I quit.
You quit.
I quit the movie.
Why did you quit?
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar.  I never could tell the truth.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
It's in your play.
You like my play.
Yes.
Why?
It's about life.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
 No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
 It's about a man who gets a second chance.
Evening, Annie.
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
I...
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
It's...
It's okay...
Evening, Annie.  See you at rehearsal.
You know your line?
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
Go you Huskies.
 They leave it out all night?
Not worth stealing.  Only thing in town worth something.  Stained glass window.
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
But why the dalmation?
It was either that, or a sardine.
You get what you pay for.
That's true.  You grow up here?
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
Nice town.
You want to talk about it?
...that...that he prayed for a second chance.  But...do you see?
Yes.
That, he says, there are no second chances...that he's been presented what he prayed for...and: he's ruined it.
Yes...
But, but but but...
No, no, I see...
That: in an act of...
Yes...
Of mercy...off...
I understand...
...that...he sees that...
As the Old Mill goes around...
Of course, of course that's what I'm saying.  As the Old Mill goes around, he sees...
Of course.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
That's that's that's that's beautiful.
And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech.  Just you.
Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
And likewise.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
 Next train in'nt for two hours.
So that the Old Mill, the Old Mill represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
No, no.  Of course, that's exactly what it represents.
That whole...
The, the, the, the sanctity of everyday things...
Everyday things...yes.
For example, he's just come back from a fire and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
I live there.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
Surest thing you know.
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
That's what the swing is there fore...
 ...that's what the swing is there fore...that its purpose, isn't it...
...I always thought so...
...such a pleasant sound.
Mmm.
Cause, cause, it's...it's the simple things that...
Yes...
...that.
Waal, there you are, and Have I Got Some News for you...
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Sa pleasure.
Guess who is THIS CLOSE to a nomination to State Senate...which is this close to one stop from Congress!
...who...?
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
Mister White is...
Nice meeting you...they were, let me tell you, they were a bit coy at first, I told them: Look: the people are tired, they're going to vote their pocketbook, yes, but...
What happened in 1973?
Don't run off.  Don't run off, we need you.  You know why?  You're why we're here.  Your script is why we're here...  Gimme that.  Big deal.  We fight a little bit? You show me a family that doesn't.  But we got something special.  What is it? We're here to make a movie.  Can't use the Old Mill.  Well, that happens.  What you got to do, you find the essence - what was it, that brought us here.  It wasn't a building, Joe, it was an idea. It was an essence - what is the essence of your story?  Joe?
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
Then, you write that.  And then this is our second chance.  That's why we're here.
I want to make a good film.
I know you do.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
Hey, it's with the G-ds.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet?
Um, no.
 Grace, get on the other phone.  Call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some nosh...what do you like to drink...?
I don't drink.
Did my matzohs come?  Get some for everybody.  Thank you.  Lemme tell you about my first movie...
What, what what are you doing here?
Yes, that's right.
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
What are they offering?
Ten thousand dollars.
That's so beautiful...
I beg your pardon?
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  Although it is altered..."
Sure, but... ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they... this movie is budgeted at fifty million dol...they're coming up here, offer us a meal...
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...
...not the Lazyboy...
Hi, Sherry...
...put it in the living room.  And we have thirteen at the table.
...we don't have thirteen at table...
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the director...
Waal, then, invite someone else, then...
I don't want to invite someone else because this is the most exclusive...
Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy.  Sher.  This is your party, and whatever...
Hi Doug.
Cal.  I want a city council meeting.
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party... City Council?  What's the trouble?
Main Street.
 Doug, the traffic light...
Fuck the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture.
Hi.
 What are you doing?  I love your script.
 They decided, I decided to, to...you love what?
You're still here.
I...I decided to give it another ch...
I love your script.
What?
 Mornin', Annie...
See you at rehearsal tonight?
"In the name of justice, sir, I bid you pause; for she is our Queen..."
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving them a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
You'd know better'n me.
How can you say that?
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You can go back..."
I can?
You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill" when I don't have an old mill?
Well, first, you got to change the title.
 No, he doesn't want to work out with Waterford Huskies...Because he's Bob Barrenger...Call up his girl in Aspen, have 'em ship his weight...Yeah, well, fine, he's not gonna do the Pond scene unless he can work out.  Call up his girl in Aspen, and have her ship the weights out...
Who designed these costumes?  Who designed these costumes?  It looks like Edith Head puked and that puke designed these costumes.  Get Madge.
 Your wife is on the phone.
I have no wife.
 We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
 Wally, I got to takes out the window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
...Claire's got a problem.
Wally, if I hafes a moment of your time, look at these storyboards.  THIS SHOOT, I can't shoot this shot, you want.
Why?
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or can I lose the shot.
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the film is in that shot.
But, Wally, the window of the firehut...
I don't care.  Fix it.
 You show Claire these sketches?
Yes.
Did she throw up?
That isn't very nice.
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
I can't tell.
Why not?
She won't stop crying...
 Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving, get him a bunch of Lilacs to send to the broad.
Towns out of Lilacs.
You go in her room, take the Lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap 'em up, and get a card from Marty.  What's her problem?
She doesn't want to bare her breasts.
She doesn't want to bare her breasts...what, in the "nude scene?" What are we paying her three mil for?
She's got "religion."
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
Claire?...Claire?  Just figure out how to take the shot. Claire...Claire?  It's Wally.  May I come in?
 What is it, Pal...?
What...?
I can't do it, Walt.
You can't do what?
It isn't right.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
Forget the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...what are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha... wha... I try to be good.  The only thing I care about is...
I know that...
Is...is the MOVIE!
I know that, Claire.  I, we all know...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...no, they don't.
...they treat me like a child.  I, I...to bare my body.
Now, look.  Claire: Listen to me.  I want to tell you a story.
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
I...I...
Who are these from?
Marty.
Well that's very thoughtful of him. Elanora Duse...
...I can't do it, Wally...
Listen to me.  Elanora Duse was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist.  I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
 What?
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
...I...
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
...I know...I know...
 ...and, and, and did she?  And she did the seven shows?
No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
Wally...
I know, I know.
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world.  And it seems everybody wants...
Yes...
...wants a piece...
Yes...
And you know what?
We, we have to give it.
 ...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
That, that's your life's blood on the st...
I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies, she'd bare her breasts to do voice over.
I...
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I...
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to double for her, her tits, the tits scene.  Call L.A.  I want to see some pictures of the women's tits.  Of their tits.
I'm very sorry I...
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch!  Can we replace him?
We start shooting in three days.
You want to see the fireman's costumes? Cause I found this Moleskin for the collar, it's not black, but it looks black...  it's not brown, but...
Marty Rossen's touched down.
 What I need to say...
Yes...
About conflict...
That's why you didn't want to take the Mill out...you've...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
The Firehouse...
I...
But but but but but it's better without...
How...?
Wait wait wait wait wait he get's a second chance, do you see?  And you get a second chance!
No, I don't...
 He doesn't go back to the mill, he gets a second chance to go back to the firehouse...
You don't need the Mill.  This is what  you see: this is what you are.  This is what the script is saying...  Hi, Emma, see you tonight?
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what I see you saying, is: you have the two elements, Fire and Water.  The Firehouse, and the Old Mill...do you know, you could...
What are you doing tonight?
Me?
Yes.
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Marteleh, vos macht a yid...?
You cool the broad out?
I left that for you.
That's thoughtful.  Ziz good, you try this?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates.
 What'd you do, build this...?
How was your flight?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over sheep...
Did you bring Bob's weights
They're coming Fed Ex.
 What's in all the bags?
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna wet myself.
I'm gonna bring it off.
55 days and I take home the camera.  I got an idea for a product placement...
Hiya Sally...
How's the arm?
Good!  A sign it's getting well.
 Stop...
That's what I said.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
Like dykes and dogs.
Yeah.  Come in.
I'm just...
The prices are going up.
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
I don't eat vegetables.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Sure, what have you got?
What do you drink?
Bourbon and milk.
How old are you?
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone I gave you this.
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
Nice town that you've got here.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
...not if you've got something to hold on to.
Because if you cannot tells me what is it, how I, how does I take a pictures of it?  Wally wants me, push in through the weendow...
Yeah, no, can I...if you'd excuse me, I've just got to...
Hello.
I thought you had Play Practice.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
That's for sure.
What happened?
Cast stood me up.
Uh huh.
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
What?
What are you doing down there?
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
...lost the screw...
You got a paperclip?
Evening, Annie.
Evenin', sweetheart.
Go you Huskies.
You said it.
You like kids?
Never saw the point of 'em.
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Better idea.
Gonna be good as new.
Better'n new, cause it's got a story. Want to do the other part?
Ow.
What?
Y'know what you got there?  You got a fishhook in your finger.
I'm looking for the writer.
What the hell are you so down about?
 My wife's going to have a baby.
How about that.
Mmmm.  You have children?
No.  No, but we're planning to.
 Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
Yes.
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat. My thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now: what is this you want Eight hundred Thousand Dollars to do what you're being paid to, you already signed you'd do...?  What is that?
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should really not discuss...
Who is her agent?
Mitch Cohn...
He's...
Get him on the phone.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Get him on the...
I want you to hear this.
I really think that business...matters should be discussed between you t...
Well, I'm going to discuss 'em between you, babe, cause it's your idea, and you think you're going to sign to do a, then hold us up in the wilds sweetheart, you are in error...
He's on the ph...
 Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Wat...

 Hi!
Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio?  The way she played Medea?  Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first wife...
 You have no right to...
Cool it babe, you started this...
What's the...
Where have you been?
 You tell me: you tell me now, I've got to shoot on Wednesday and I will not pay your Blood Money and P.S., pal, I put the word out on the street and Betty Boop can look for work in squigglevision.
Siddown!
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
...would you excuse me, please...
You can't treat me like this.  I'm not a child!
She's absolutely r...
I'm not a child.  I have feelings... Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
 Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal.  You fuck with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your chest.  And the best to Marion...  Where have you been?
I...
He says they're looking for you all day, you're on salary, he needs pages, what are you, you been 'haying?' Now:
Marty...
Later for that, Walt, let's get this: we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"... alright?  We need a new title, we need a...
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
Whatever it is.  Go do it.  How you doing on the permit?
It's just a formality.
That's why I want it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
I can't.
Why?
You can't write it?
I can write it.  I can't type it.
Why?
I hurt my fingers.
Get a typist.  Get'im a typist.  Get outta here.
Eight-hundred grand to show her tits...
Pay her.
I don't got the money.
Find the money.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
 No no no no no no no no find me the money...
 This is Joe White... in six ten, they're sending up a typist?
 Okay, I thank you.  It's here.
You said, "You can't talk that way to a lady..."  You stood up for me.  What do you have to drink?
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
I, actually, yes.
I love Jewish men.
Why?
You know...where's your bathroom?
You liked the script, huh...?
 Where have you been?
Hi!
We had a date.
We did...?
Where have you been?
I've been thinking.
Where have you been, we had a date for three...where have you been...?
I have to tell you something...
Well, I know, because they told me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole town has been warped by the, by the, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a date, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
I wasn't doing business...
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't you, j...
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
 Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
I'm sorry.
Who is this person that you've found?
 He works on the movie.
No.  Don't tell me that.
I'm sorry.
Why, you whore!
Can you type?
Never admit you can type.
If you can type, they need you over at the hotel.
Look.
I feel so close to you...
Look, look, I like you very much...
I like you, too.
But not that way...
But we...
Look, look there's someone else...
Great.  Who is it?
"Room Service!"
 Would you go in...
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside
You have to sign for it.
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
Oh, G-d...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide...
I don't drink.
It's for your finger.
One moment.
You have to hide.
Who is that?
That's my...
Oh.
Will you help me out...?
I...
Hi.
You going to ask me in?
Thought you might like this.
 Thank you.
Read the card.
 "To the love of my life, Love, Doug."
The other side.
Oh.
Don't you think you should put them in water.
Why?
...because if you don't, they die.
Shouldn't we start?
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time.
Later on.
Then I'll come back, then.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
It occurred to me, you'd wanna have this: sort of a memento of our...
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in bed, I told her I could not -- we don't know each other, you see...
We had a script conference.
I told her thank you very much, but it was inconvenient because, uh, because...
You can do it.
Because I'd met someone else.
 Oh, okay.
You believe that?
I do if you do.
But it's absurd.
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
I used to go out with a politician.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Sure did.
Why?
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
Yes.
Go you Huskies!
And don't you worry about that permit...
Why, that's right fine...
Mornin' George.
Hey, Chunky.  Well, we're glad to have you here.  My wife, Sherry, SHER, YOUR BROTHER'S HERE.  We're having a party, matofact, Tuesday night, for Walt and Bob Barrenger...
Mmm....
Havin' 'em over, home-cooked meal, if you'd...
Well, I'd be awfully...
Where the hell have you been?  It's...
Sherry, this...
 Mornin' Sherry.
It's a quarter after nine, I've been on the phone to...
Morning, Mrs. Baily, Mista Bailey...
I've got two days to get this house...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer.
I am so glad to meet you.  We are so glad to have you here, and welcome you to our...I, you know, they had c... I'm, yearly I redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...
What is that?
The house, the 1835.  The original kitchen, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
It's lovely.
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies.
My oh my.
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
I have to talk to you.
Doug, this is Mr...
Oh, how thoughtless of me.  Would you like a cup of tea...
...he's the producer of the movie.
 I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, forget Ten Thousand Dollars, for three days to two weeks. You know what it would cost for them to build this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
Doug...
Now:  The Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
Don't tell me you're out of Wallpaper.
I told you, we could have it by Wednesday...
Wednesday, don't tell me Wednesday, the biggest grossing box office star in the world is coming for dinner Tuesday...
Waal, if you ordered something common...
Something common?  I'm going to give you something common.  I'm going to give you an injunction, is what I...Mister Mayor.
Huh.  Well, the Waterford Merchant's Association demands, through me as their council, five percent of the profits of the movie, as figured by and...  geared to the most favorable definition of profits of either A) the Producer...
Why, you little sheeny...
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
You think so?
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
Cuppa coffee, and a...
With you inna moment.  I'm a little short-handed.
Where's Carla?
Hiya, Annie...
Annie, sorry I ain't been to a meetin' of the Drama Club...
Oh, good...
Good morning to you...whatsa matter?
I can't get it to come out right.
What's the scene...
It used to be the Old Mill.
What've you got?
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
Annie, you want something to eat?
What's the scene about...?
It's good to see you, too...
Annie?
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling you how to wr...
Please...
How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes.  He goes up to her.  "What happened to the horse?"  She looks at him.  She takes his hand...
Ah, ah, ah...
I hurt you?
What happened to his finger?
It was burnt.
Mmm.
And then it was really hurt.
Ah, ah, ah.  That's what she says, that's what she says.  He says, "Sister, I've come from a fire..."  But she, but she, she says it was not the fire which hurt you...it...
...how was it hurt?
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
She realizes -- it was not the fire which hurt him...that the true hurt was her.  Was her...
...yes.
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
...yes.
Has been wounded by her heat...by her infidelities...
Anybody here seen Carla?
Because, because, because if it's about purity, it's...it's...and then, then, you don't need the nude scene.
Because it's about purity...
That's...that's exactly what it's about. Take...
That's right...
...take any two people...
...anybody seen my daughter...?
...take you and me...
 ...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?
I can't find the writer.
 ...totally false...totally false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
Not now.
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Oh, that's great.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
Take it off.  Take that stupid fucking shirt off right now.  Well, if I had to say one thing, I would say it's purity.
 Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am past chagrined, I'm mortified at the way you were spoken to...
I...
An artist of your caliber...
I'm only trying to...
I know what you are, I am so sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
The minute I read that script I said...
I know...
...she works with animals, she...
...yes...
...she has a home...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community respects her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, toil...when are we free of them...?  When...?
He treated me as if I were a child...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to us.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's really talk.  We could, we'll have dinner, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
I'm sorry, Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
 Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...any time...  What does the woman want from life?
She wants eight-hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
Pay her off.
We don't have the money.
Find it.
If you do the product placement...
It's a computer company...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY - BAZOOMER-COM?!
"Bazoomer dot com."
I can't put a computer in a movie shot in 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna do that?
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?!
 Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee... I NEED EIGHT-HUNDRED GRAND. I...I don't care where it comes from.  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY.  I JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
She doesn't show her tits!!! She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
The movie's about purity.  So we don't show her breasts.  We show them to him. She keeps her back to the camera.
...she keeps her back to the camera?
It'll hurt the box-office.
They know what her tits look like.
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse scene.
I'm gonna nail it.
I know you are.  Go you Huskies.
We got the permit.
Is that one hell of a kid?
He just saved us eight-hundred thousand bucks.
He's got a gift for fiction.
We got to do something nice for him.
Gimme a pencil.  Get him a bottle of...get him some maple syrup.  Stick this card on it, and put it in his room.
Maple syrup.
Yeah.
 Hold on, I wanna add to that.
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good, too.
Bet you did.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Ain't no second chances in life.
Zat true?
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
Get the...
Are you al...?
We gotta get her out of here.
 Are you alright?
 I...
You got to get out of here...
Oh G-d, oh G-d, oh G-d...do you have a cig...
He's fine...it's a...
You're going to be fine.  I'll stop by tomorrow.
 Thank you.
Yessir...
 He's...you wanna talk to...?
 Hello, Jerry.  I'm fine.  I'll be ready Wednes...I'm here to make a movie, Bob. Now don't you worry your, hey, Pal, when have I ever let you down bef...Okay, Babe, you, too.
Are you okay?
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a schoolnight, something...
Bobby...
Everybody needs a hob...
Walt, I wonder if I could take a minute of your time.  I need a day off...
Who is it?
Thiz the police.  Is Mr. Barrenger in there?
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
Uh, look...
Look: okay.  Okay.  Look: look you're driving, countryside, so on, you picked her up, she was hitch...
No, hey, hey...al, she hid in the back of the car!  Happens all the...
 Is Mr. Barrenger there...?
No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddamn, she wasn't in...
She wasn't in...you were al...
There's no witnesses.
No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
No, I just...just Joe, just Joe...
Joe, the writer?
Just him and me.
Then she wasn't in the car.  Say it.
She wasn't in the...
Nobody knows it but us.  Alright?  It says here...  Are we together on this?  Because it's sink or swim here, pals...
 You guys had better leave us a...
Mr. Barrenger...
Yes...?
I'm very sorry to...
Well.  What seems to be the...?
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers' license?
Of course he...
Could I see it, please...?
Were you under the inf...
No.
And who was driving the...
I was alone in the car.  I was driving.
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, but...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
...I have to give you this ticket for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
 You have to what?
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and... (apologetically he hands the ticket to Bob) They'll, uh, these things happen, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
Well, officer, don't worry ab...
If there's anything I...
 Yeah.  Hello, Mr. Mayor...Walt Price! No, no, sir, he's fine.  Well, he's right here!  Would you like to...?  You are not to see that girl again...do you...
Hello.
 ...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
 Bob, are you alright?
Hi.
Hi.
Where you going?
Going home.
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
 What?
I told them what you said about the script...
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
...how else can you talk?
No, that's true.
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
Is it...
Yep, n'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.
I told them what you said about the script...
Would you like to see it?  I've got the key back at my store...
I'd love to.
How's your star?
Gosh, you look nice.
...what...?
What would you do with it, the printshop...
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans.
Yes, it's a lovely idea...
Print it right here.
Oh, my.  Life in the country.  One second.
Well.  There you go.
Press still works.
It does?
Did as of last week.
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
You'd do the newspaper right here.
That's something a man could do...?
You know what else a man can do?
What?
One moment...
Pelting down out there.
People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
Left the keys inside, in my jacket.
Well.  'S'pose I should be getting home...look.
Cal...
Annie, got an umbrella?
Nope.
I'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
Then you'll be wet.
I'm goin' off-shift.  Come on... I'll walk you home.
Ten dollars apiece for outdated textbooks you or I could buy retail for a dollar ninety-five.
Mornin', Carla...how's the itching...?
Okay, Doc.
Bear with me, now -- because what're we getting for our money?  See the cat and dog?  See what I'm saying?  Nice to take this opportunity to mount an investigation of...
Morning, Carla, what happened to you?
She went to fetch a pail of water.
 You see what I'm saying, take this opportunity to mount an investigation of the price of school textbooks.  Bear with me now: both the cost, and the content of...look here...
...because what're we getting for our money?  "See the nice dog.  See the nice cat?"
So you see what I'm saying...the movie is about purity...
I've always seen that.
We don't show her breasts, we just show your reaction...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't tell you...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
 Thank you.
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
I think he's moved...
I, uh...  Um...
That makes a lot of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't coming to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you act.  What are you doin' this evening?
I'm having dinner with W...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
You mind...?
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Marty...
Yeah?
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can get away, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
I've got a date.
He's got a date.  He's got a date, is this guy fantastic...? Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find!
 I'm trying, honey.  I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your mom coming?  Oh.  What did the midwife...?
Did you, where are we going tonight?
I...?
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule?  Where are we booked tonight?
My wife's having a baby.
You what...?  Is that on the call sheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that personal business?  Ah, Christ. Marty...are we paying you?
I...
She didn't even finish knitting me the sweater...
Mornin', Doc...
You doin' here, Doug?  Thought you started out the day with that pernicious caffeine...
Kiss my ass.
Well.
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
Big day last night.
Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
Mornin', Carla.
Mornin', Uncle Ron.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden, three times inna night.
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
Who got their heads cut?
...some fella.  Orders a Manhattan.
What?
Who got their heads cut?
Uh, Bob Barrenger, fella, Cameraman...
You said three...
Did I?  I think you're mistaken.
I wasn't in the car...
We're going to s...
Doug, she says that she wasn't in the c...
Yeah?
 I've got the wrong room.
 Arrest him.
What is the...?
Arrest him.
For what...?
 Conspiracy in Statutory Rape.
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
This young woman.
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
 Who is it raped you?
Nobody.
Well, what's the beef?
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
You were in the car with Bob?
No.
Then what is the...?
Now what is this, you sonofabitch! Because if you haven't heard about the laws of Malicious Prosecution, you're about to.  DON'T FLINCH WHILE I'M TALKING TO YOU, YOU TWO BIT SPEEDTRAP FRAUD: There's an old saying, two scariest things in the world, a black man with a knife and a Jew with a lawyer.  Now, I am a lawyer, and I am the Jew, and you continue ONE MOMENT with this slanderous shit here in this public place, I'm going to have your ass over my mantleplace.  THE KID WAS NOT IN THE CAR, SHE SAYS THAT SHE WASN'T IN THE CAR, NO ONE SAYS SHE WASN'T IN THE CAR, NO ONE SAYS THAT SHE WAS IN THE CAR, YOU HAVE NO CORPUS AND YOU HAVE NO CASE, AND YOU KNOW IT.  SO I'M NOT PAYING PATSY WITH YOU HERE, YOU MOTHERFUCKER.  Look in my eyes: I made eleven million bucks last year and I don't like being trifled with.  Now I think that the better part of valor, though we've got your back up here...the better part of valor is to step away.  Or, before G-d, I will see you disbarred.  Now, what do you think?  We all have a movie to make.  Now, can we stay together here...?  What do you say?  Have a cigar.
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
I wasn't in the car.
We know that you weren't.
...because you treat me like a child...you treat me like a child... that's why I can't come...
He took advantage of me.
...upset and impressionable.  Get me the Mayor.
 ...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
 I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
And a fantasy object...
 Tell him to get dressed...
Uh, sir...
 Wally?
Look, Carla, this is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...and we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you.
Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, but...
Here this dream world has come to you. Now, you obviously have an active, a vivid imagination.
Her...
I swear that that woman in my room...
Be quiet, Bob.  A fertile mind.  Now we can use that kind of people in our work. Yes, we can.  Now, and this is what occurs to me... There's a part in the film...isn't that right, Marty?
Mmm.
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
 Here it is: Statutory r...blah, blah, blah, blah... "statutory"... "unsupported testimony by the..."  Hold on, Bobby.  You've got nothing and you know it.  By G-d, you know it.  Harassment.  You need a... even if this was true, you need a witness.  You need someone puts her in the car.  And you've got nothing.  Now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film.  Yes, we'd love to have you... Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?
Isn't that right?  I'm sorry that you all went to this...
I knew she wasn't in the car.
This has been just an unfortunate.
 Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
Is he cool or angry?
Well, these things happen.  Purpose of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of cigarettes Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary requirements...
 So we just got lucky.
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast.  He needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
And I need a drink.
 If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
I'm ready!
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
What'll I do for fun?
Whyn't you learn your lines?
I know my lines...
You do...?
I just don't know what order they come in...
I tell you what, let's ditch these cockamamie locals.  I need to get outta here.  Go to some roadhouse tonight, just us.  Claire, Bob, siddown, have a bottle of wine.  Tell me where we're going, and let's go.
Well, you must, where did they... where...I...
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
My wife just went into labor...
Half a buck I'd close it down.  It's per...you know...it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls.
He should be put in jail.
Half a buck I'd put him in jail.
You should.
I had a witness, I would.
A witness to what?
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident.
You mean with White?
What?
You mean you need a witness in addition to White?
Who's White?
The writer.
 He saw the accident...?
Sure.
He saw the girl in the car...
You bet he did.
Don't you touch that... I want them gone.
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
I want them thrown in jail.
Sherry, Sherry...
 What?  Get me the State Police.
Good morning.
Sleep well?
Yeah, you?
Oh yeah...
We could live up here, live up in the country.
Now you're talking...
And we could get up every morning...
...well, we do that anyway...
And come to the printshop.  You know why?
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to write.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Not without a rolltop desk.
Well, I could get a rolltop desk.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
Well ain't you amazing.
Lookit that, up already.
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
Where Movie Star Bob Barrenger, fresh from his troubles with the law last year...
...is once again in hot water.  Involved in a car crash last night with a young, a very young woman, Mr. Barrenger is being arrested today for...
You better make sure you got your facts straight, pal, cause, you step off the line and I'm going to sue you personally for...
We're looking for a Joseph Turner White.
Oh, good, yes.  Good morning.  Where are you taking Mr. Barrenger?
We are looking for a Mr. Joseph Turner White?
What are you doing with Mr. Barrenger?
He's under arrest.
Oh, good.  I'm his lawyer...and you must be Perry Mason.  Guess what, you're about one-half step from a world of hurt...how diverting...the Mayor's gonna have your ass.  Can I watch?
Well, you guess what.  The Mayor sent me.  I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
...a history of nothing, he was acquitted.
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend.  I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
He told you that!?
He didn't have to tell.
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
Oh, you're his attorney, too?
Later for you, pal.
Okay.
Bobby, don't say anything.
Nothing happened.
We'll see about that at the inquest.
Yeah, hi, pal.  I need to talk to you.
What is it all about?
I saw...
How do they know that, you told them?
No.
What did you say to them?
I didn't say anything to them.
How do you know you saw it?
I don't know.
Well, then, you didn't see it, right?
I don't...
You didn't see it...
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
 I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses?
I...
You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
I've got to go to the jail.
...he's going to give you a couple of minutes.
What am I gonna do?
You got to tell 'em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I tell them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll... it'll ruin his career...
But that's what happened.
But it'll stop the movie.
Maybe they'll be other movies.
They'll...they'll blackball me.
Carla was in the car, right?
I...I think that's right.
...you think that's right...
What'm I gonna do?
Lotta hubbub on the street.  I'm taking you the back way.
 Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
You want me to lie.
To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  IF you aren't sure, then they have nothing. Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe: wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart, you know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roost, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself...If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll direct the third one.  You are a part of this world.  You have to do the right thing: we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, literally is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line.  You have to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
...Joseph Turner White...
Hear ye, hear ye.  Sixth District Court. And for the county of Kadona, State of Vermont, the honorable James Addison Flynn presiding.  All those having business before this court, draw forward and you will be heard.
All rise.
Please...Mr. White?  This is a simple matter of...
Uh huh, all we need's a simple fact or to...you're going to give your recollection of the accident last evening, at the corner, State and Main. Would you please swear him in.
Do you swear to tell the truth...
 ...the arraignment, as we said of Bob Barrenger, The Bob Barrenger, star of "The Old Mill," about to begin shooting here, in picaresque and sleepy... (sound of shouting, and reporter looks around) we should say, formerly sleepy...Yes, yes, it's...yes, it's Claire Wellesley, and we're going to try to get a look at...
 They need those rewrites on the "Old Mill" scene...
...about his personal life, though I can tell you a few things about...
Would you please hold all calls to my room?
Though I can tell you a few things about his dietary requirements.
Mornin', Billy, where ya goin' in such a hurry?
Watch the curbs, now...
 Where you off to?
I, uh...I'm leaving...
Why?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did.  I don't suppose you could help me with that, could you?  Turn back the clock, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my purity, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you?  But what is truth? Eh?  Ain't that the thing?  What is true?
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's s'posed to point down to accentuate the genitals, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his ears?
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people?
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands while they die.  What'd you say your problem was?
I just swore my life away, back in that...
 Mornin', Chessy, how's the back?
I ruined my life.  Isn't that funny, that you can actually do it in one moment just like they say.  I ruined my life back in that courthouse.
What courthouse?
Courthouse back in town.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
What?
Ain't got no courthouse.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.
Well, where do they hold court?
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
Mornin', judge, what brings you here?
I'm s'posed to hear some deposition, some fool saw the accident last night.
...the courthouse burnt down...?
Yep.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.  Part of a spate of fires, Old Mill, Courthouse... S'posed to've been set by some deranged teenager.
Yep, never did discover who set 'em...
I thought you needed to get it out of your system.
...a blight, a blight and an obscenity...that's good English, isn't it?  How's that for entertainment?
What are you going to do?
I'm going to tell the truth.
...and to exterminate this vermin, yes, I use that term, who have abused, who have desecrated, yes, the license granted to them by a gracious nation...
...who spew filth and degradation... 
...thank you...
...you want to clean up?
Yes, thank you.
Five minutes, and we're going live to the network.
 ...foreign, and un-American perversions of the Democratic process.  By those we have entrusted with our dreams...
Do something.
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
...and I was just paying off my house in Malibu...
Thank G-d, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
I'm out.
I don't getcha.
The girl was in the car.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
It's no you, it's...
No, what is it?
I have to tell the truth.
...that's just so narrow...
The girl was in the car.
Then you're finished in show business.
So be it.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
For what cause?
I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.
I'm a lawyer.
Howie...
Yeah?
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here is I just flew seven hours cause you asked me here.
What for?
 For this...I hope you need it, cause it's coming outta your budget...
Hi.
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
I....
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could possibly make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath...
What's in the case?
Eight-hundred thousand dollars in cash.
And what was it you wanted to say?
Gut Yuntif.
 I've come to give myself up...
Well give yourself up to someone else. I'm gonna get in some golf.  Hiya, Annie.  Give yourself up to her.
I have learned a lesson.  And the lesson is this...that everybody needs a second chance.  You, me, and these fine, film people here.  You know, they have a high profile, but that doesn't mean they aren't deserving of our trust, and of our respect. You know, I think there is a lesson here, and the lesson is this: it is a lesson of Tolerance...and, as we look at this industry, at this clean, American industry, and as I begin my campaign for congress...
Okay.  Are we getting set up here...are we getting set up...People...?  Can we settle...can we settle now...?
Okay, this is picture...
Quiet, please...
Mornin', Harry.  Heard you had a little fire last night.
Waal, you didn't have nothin' to do, Doc, wouldn't life be dull...?
Mornin', sister.
 We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Sister, I've just come from a fire...
...to come by next Sunday, and we'll give you a second chance.
Only second chance I know, chance t'make the same mistake twice.
Well, time will tell.
 That's a cut!
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
I'll be there.
You bringing your new friend?
Sure plan to
 He have any special delivery requirements?
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Go you Huskies?
You bet your life.
