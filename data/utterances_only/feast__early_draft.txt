 Okay ladies, gather around!
This is the type of chisel that we will all be using today. It is not to be used for "hitting" things, it is to be used for "chiseling" things... gently.
And does anyone know why we don't want to hit things?
Because we don't want to break the dinosaur bones.
Correct! Now, let's get to it and earn those anthropology badges!
 Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Um, well...
Are you lying to me?
Well...
What did we say about lying?
I'm not lying.
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
I said I'm not lying.
Well, let's just say this... You don't have to join your troop if your claim of sickness is genuine, however if you are lying, someone will always know...
And remember what happens to a liar's soul when they die? It burns in hell... for eternity.
...and you don't get the badge.
Not so hard girls, slow and steady is how Troop Daddy likes it.
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
 I just hit it like you said.
Yeah, right. Let me see there...
Whoops!
What is it?
It's deep. That's weird, maybe it's a hidden cavern, with an old cowboy's stash!  Listen up ladies, we may have found a secret treasure! Who wants to be rich!?
Wow! I see something shiny --

 ...the search for the missing mining team will be further complicated by tonight's expected blizzard and by the unstable conditions of these deep tunnels. The dynamite blasting to the mountain's face has created a number of deep sinkholes into the rocky terrain. Thus far, no signs of life have been detected, yet town officials are still optimistic the miners will be found...
...On a brighter note or should we say a darker note, tomorrow's solar eclipse will bring out adults and children alike for a celebration of this metrological event. Let's go now to Devon Lucie from KRUI's weather center, Devon?

Okay, mommy.
Let's get this over with.
I love a woman with enthusiasm.
I got two hundred bucks says none of you can beat me!
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
 C'mon guys--
Gimme some ACTION --
Unless you people want to die you'll do what I say and you'll do it fast!
You hold it right there, mister.
 A storm of hell's coming down on this place any minute!
Drop the canon!
I'm not armed now, just hear me out.
I'll drop you and not even think about it!
Let me explain!
YOU GOT ONE SECOND TO --
LISTEN TO ME!
Take a good look! There's at least a FOUR of these things out there!
I saw one of them tear up five men like they were corn on the cob!
I don't know what they are. I don't know where they came from. All I do know is that these fuckers are fast, nasty, and hungry.
...And they can fly. Not to mention they're damn-shitfuckin' near impervious to conventional firepower.
Now these things are coming. RIGHT NOW. We have to lock this bar down!
That means doors, windows, drains, basements, skylights, whatever, and we have to do it fast!
 You! Get on that phone. Call the cops, the National Guard, townies, whoever kicks ass and get 'em out here.
 We gotta seal off the back, seal off the top and lock down the bottom.  Any questions?
Who are you?
I'm the hero --
HELP ME! SOMEBODY!
GET DOWN!
GET 'EM!
NOOOO!
Close that window!
Got 'cha!
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Hot damn!
God damn you!
You'll hit her!
What the FUCK is that?
AGE: 27 OCCUPATION: SURVIVOR LIFE EXPECTANCY: HOPEFULLY LONGER THAN THE LAST HERO
Beer me.
 IS IT CLEAR?!
Yeah.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Nah, I got the gun.
All right god damn it! Who shot me!? Who did it!?
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
 Her fella.
 My husband...
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.
What?
What the hell happened down here?!
I didn't do it! It was fuckin' monsters, asshole!
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
 So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
He only shot you once.
Huh?
 He shot you the other time.
It was an accident. Sorry.
Look at it!
 Fan-fuckin-tastic.
Oh my God... What is that?
That's one piece of four problems.
Please elaborate.
That head over there?
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
And the rest of 'em?
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
The next one is taller, but all out of proportion. Like a "teen beast."
He was spastic, clumsy, but deadly just the same.
If I'm not mistaken, I just took the eye out of the Mother. She can guide the attacks. She calculates.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
And the last one is the...
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
No sign of any weaknesses. No sign at all. He's an eating machine.
 Of all the friggin' bars to go into...
All right, we need to lock this place down! Everyone in this room?
Oh my god! My son! My SON!
Wait!
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
Stop her!
Hey!
Mommy, the TV doesn't work.
 Careful! C'mon!
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
 Let's lock off this room.
Okay, baby? Never, ever, never. Never, ever, never, baby. Just stay close. I am never gonna let go. I love you, love you, lo --
NOOOOOOOO!
Shoot him!!!
Dammit.
Oh my god...
Is that the only phone?
The back phone is wrecked too.
This is really happening. I can't believe this is really happening.
We'll be fine. We're gonna be just fine.
What'd you say?
I didn't say anything.
Thank you.
Are you okay? Do you need something for your hand?
No, it doesn't hurt.
The nerve endings are shot, can't feel a thing.
That's a pretty good scam.
Pays more than the couch.
Here!
Hey!
Back off!
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Why don't you go check it out?
Fuck no.
 I have a signal! I have... Diane? Diane listen to me... get the kids and get in the basement... do it right now...
 Diane don't do this now. I'll explain later. Not now! We can... I'm at a bar... look... shut up! JUST SHUT UP AND GET IN THE FUCKING BASEMENT, DIANE! Diane! Diane?... Hello? Dammit! I lost the signal!
 Okay. Okay. Look now, I gotta get outta here! I gotta go! My wife... See my wife is alone... I gotta go! She could be in trouble. I GOTTA GO!
I wouldn't do that.
Fuck you, bitch!
YOU CAN RISK YOUR LIFE, BUT NOT MINE! YOU PULL THAT TOUGH BOY SHIT ONE MORE TIME AND I'LL SLICE YOU FROM NECK TO NUTS!
I'd listen to her if I were you.
 You willing to shoot me?
If it keeps us alive.
Save your energy for a real problem.
 You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
We can't risk letting them in.
 Right.
 This shit burns.
Just take a seat.
Don't touch me!
I think it's hungry again.
We have to kill it.  Can you help?
Fire!
I think we got --
You're welcome.
Jesus, it took all that? All those bullets? How can we possibly fight off the others?
We'll think of somethin'.
Maybe we don't have to fight them.
What you wanna do, call 'em names?
No, scare them. Scare them right back. This is a species stand-off. We just need to show them we're not vulnerable. That we're formidable.
How?
I need a stick.
Stand back.
Let's get that board down.
What the hell you doing?
Showing superiority. The scent of their dead may drive them away.
Come on. Come onnnnnn.
Is there a call, or something?
See that you monkey fucks! That's what you get when you mess with us! Woman or man, I don't give a fuck! Shit don't make me gay, you'll be sucking my dick!
Nice...
It's working. I think it's working.
Good christ! They're cannibals!
 Oh... my... god.
Dude, they're fuckin'!
Wow!
Get back!
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
You weren't helpin'.
Go douche.
What now?
We're stuck in here. That's what.
We've got some tools, and extra planks in the back, if we're on the same page.
Let's work.
Well, it don't look pretty.
But it's got teeth.
Will these boards hold?
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Good.
Pocahantas!
If you don't mind me askin', how'd you run into these things?
More importantly, how did you run away from these things?
It all started about forty hours ago...
Holy mother of...
We barricaded ourselves in the cellar. Then it was just listening. We listened to those things destroy an entire heard of livestock. They cried and screamed but there was nowhere to go. It took those things all night to eat 'em. Cattle, lamb, and a full horse stock. Devoured in total. They just kept coming. Like they were insatiable. The swarm crept toward the house. Closer and closer, consuming anything in the way. Slashing, feeding and licking the bones clean. Just when we said our prayers, the first ray of sun hit the house...
That first beam of sunlight drove 'em away. Somewhere. They disappeared. Gone. We decided to run for it. We called who we could to warn them and we didn't see a soul the whole drive out. We went all day until our tank and spare canisters in the trunk were dry. We came upon a gas station to refill...
What's goin' on? The pumps are shut off.
There's nobody here --
They've been here!
Turn on the pump!  I'll find something.
We had no time. We didn't know if we were going in the right direction, or if there even was a right direction anymore. All we knew was the sun was dropping and we had to get enough fuel to make it through the night at 90 miles per hour...
Suck it down you metal bitch. Suck it down.
 Help!
It happened fast...
Get in the car!
Get in the car, baby.
Roll!
Close the roof!
Shit!
Shoot that motherfu-
We drove the tank dry, with Debbie's corpse riding shotgun. We stopped for only seconds about an hour ago to gas up and lay Debbie to rest. It must have smelled the blood or something. We got back on the road and...
Break!
Go! Go! Go!
Look out!
And that's how I ended up here.
And the head?
I don't want to talk about that.
So, your husband ditched you?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Well, justice is funny.
You say there's four, huh?
There's six now, actually.
Yeah, thanks for that.
 You know something? Standing next to you makes me dumber.
You wanna take this outside?
 Case in point.
Easy.
What do we do?
There's no protocol to follow here. We just gotta take stock, hole in, and think a way out of this.
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
Okay, well that's something.
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
I might be able to do something with the bottles...
You're gonna need a whole lot more than that to get outta here alive.
I thought you were dead, old timer.
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Oh? And what's that?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
This is unbelievable. Nobody knows a thing about these monsters flying around, tearing people apart.
Sorry.
There has to be somebody. An entire room of people can't come up with an explanation? This kinda thing just doesn't come out of the BLUE.
Consider us in the blue then.
Do you think they're gone? I haven't heard anything for a while, maybe they're gone.
Well, maybe they migrate?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
How can you be so sure? You said yourself, this started only two days ago.
We learned fast.
WE? WE learned fast? YOU are all that is left of WE. No offense Tonto, but I think someone else should play "Chief" tonight. Someone that knows the lay of the land.  Like me.
 Fine.
Now we're gettin' somewhere.
Maybe these things are like locusts or something and only come out for a few days to feed. This could just be a part of their life cycle.
We could just be a part of their life cycle.
I wouldn't do that, son.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
 Careful.
I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
Everyone stay in the middle of the room! Off the walls! Off the walls! NOW!
Now, does everyone agree that they are still out there?
 'Eh, Chief?
 Duh hickey.
He's out cold.
I know some first aid if we have a kit. Do we?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
 Find some pants.
We need to stay alert.
Hey!
 Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
 I will.
I don't think you should...
With what just happened upstairs --
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
 All right.
I'm sorr-
 She is one hot little minx.
Ah-ah-ah! You're doing that all wrong!
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
Oh yeah?
What do you know?
I know you're doing it wrong.
Enlighten us, please.
Move aside, ladies.
 You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
I'm sure.
How'd you know this?
 Remember Uncle Lou?
Uncle Lou?
madly running around with his arm ENGULFED IN FLAMES.
HOT DAMN-SONUVABITCH-HOT DAMN-GOD DAMN-SONUVABITCH!
 Uncle Louuuuuuuuuuu.
Right on. Right on. Right on.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
That's fine.
Why do you take shit from him?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Your brother, huh?
Yep.
Your parents of relation?
We lived near power lines.
I'll take over, if that's all right.
How are you holding up?
Well...
...open this.
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Oh.
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
What is this?
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Oh, no.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Really?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
Will I go crazy or something?
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
Why not then?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
But --
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Okay then.
Where are they going?
I don't wanna know.
 How does it feel?
Lousy.
You still have one left.
Right when I thought there wasn't a silver lining...
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
Spare me.
I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.
Oh yeah?
Well, it could be worse, he could be dead. Then again, the night is young.
Ya know, that's not a bad look on you, kinda 1985, but not bad. I'd hook it up.
Huh?
Leave her alone.
Hey Cyclops? Let's have a quiet contest... starting now.
 Ya know, in situations of duress, I have found that women are attracted to my authority.
Flares, the light might scare them.
These could come in handy.
Nice. Let's get everything upstairs.
You know you don't have to do this.
 I'm fine, I really am.
I admire your strength.
We all have to be strong, right?
Right.
Her name is Charlie.
 Oh...
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
I'll do anything to help.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
 Deal.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
How 'bout now?
You're a bad little girl, aren't you.
Um-hmmm.
The girl's got rhythm.
Whoaaaa...
There it is.
You wanna see, baby?
Sure.
How much you got?
How much I got, what?
How much you got to see the show?
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
What? Really?
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
Um-hmmm.
Hoh-SHIT! Help!! Help me!!!
NO! NO! NO!
OHH JESUS! HELLLP!
 I told you to stay in the main room.
 Mmmm-yyy f-fooot!
Medic!
I can't get anybody. I don't even know if I have a signal anymore.
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
Who the hell would you call?
Anyone.
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
 Well then I guess we should just give up.
 Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.
I think I know where a CB is.
Where's that?
Upstairs.
Hey, Hop-a-long! You holding out on us? You got a CB upstairs?
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
Oh yeah, hot pants? Well I'll be the judge of that.  Shotgun please.
Fine, Chief.
Gimme the keys.
NO, but I will lock you in.
What?
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
We're better off.
Who's with me?
 I'll go with ya.
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
 You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
Now, I don't want to hear any of this... "oh, I dropped the key", "wrong key", "ain't no key here." When I want out, I want out, ok?
They're right here.
 Hey!
What?!
Move slow and move quiet.
No shit.
Move it!
 You keep that key handy.
Wish me luck!
Shit!
I'm fine! I'm fine!
 Come on. Come on. Come on!
 Geeezzzus.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
Come on, come on.
 Lamaze. Lamaze. Lamaze.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
Easy.
HAAAA!
 JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
If he doesn't shut up...
Hello? Anyone there? We need help out here at the United Nations Tavern. Send guns, tanks, and all that shit. 10-4. S.O.S. Help us please.
 I found it! I found it!
Hurry!
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
SHIT.
MOVE YOUR ASS!
Misfire!
Okay, I'm ready to come out now.
Oh!
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
HEY! OPEN IT!!
Wha?
OPEN THE DOOR!
GET ME OUTTA HERE!
HELP! GOD-DAMNIT!
Oh please, no.
COME ON!
 HELLLLLLLLP!!
What the hell was that?
Dad's neutered.
Awesome!
 Now is the time to band together. We need to rise up against these monsters of the night! Those creatures are no match for the human spirit! We can do it! We just need to believe in each other! In all of us! We need to make a stand! Right here! Right now!
Dude, are you gay?
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
 What?
What?
What do you mean what?
Huh?
What's going on between you two?
Nothing.
 I saw something down there earlier tonight...
You saw nothing.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
There's a tunnel.
What tunnel? Where?
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
What's it for?
What's it for!?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Is it gassed up?
Fully.
Four door?
Two.
Open?
Covered.
How many?
Holds four.
Max?
Seven.
Nine?
Seven.
 Keys.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
 Give 'em to me, I know the tunnel.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Fuck you too.
Get in line!
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
I'm in.
Anyone else?
 I'll go!
No, don't.
Get 'em Shirley!
Just stay here, you'll be safe. I'll be back.
 I'll keep an eye on her.
You're full of shit! You think I'm gonna let you all leave the rest of us here!?
We're going to get help.
We gotta try.
Anybody else?
 Yeah, I'll go.
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Watch your feet around this group.
I love you.
I love you, too.
 I'll take the car keys, you handle the doors.
Don't lock this door! If we turn back I don't want to --
We'll be ready.
Right.
You all sure about this?
Follow me.
Where's the tunnel?
In the corner, behind the curtain.
Hellloooooooo.
Easy.
Beef jerky.
What's wrong?
Nothing, just lookin'.
You feel a breeze?
It's just cold.
Yeah... I don't know...
Keeps the kegs fresh. Don't worry about it. This place is creepy in the daytime, too.
 Scared?
No. You?
Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
The door... on three.
One... two... three!!!
Well, look at that.
Hey, little fella.
Let's go.
 She's not very nice, is she?
Yeah, this looks good. Real safe.
Shhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Nice set-up.
A bit of heat and a sprinkler... viola, hash heaven.
Looks clear.
You sure?
Ha-Sheesh, there's a lot of smoke here.
 Your boss must do pretty well.
He hasn't been able to really perfect it yet. Either he waters them too much or he cooks them with the lamps. I told him --
Fuck!
Crap!
Oh no. Oh no. Oh please...
Shut up!
NOW!
Hold it!
Whoa!
We got it!
Ohhh.
What?
Look.
We just smeared a skunk.
Shit!
Oh lord, that is wretched.
Oh that's awful!
 Let's go back.
Okay.
We gotta be close.
What?
We just made enough noise for all those things to hear us!
No way. Not yet.
It's a little bit farther.
Bad, bad idea. This is getting reeeaalllly lousy.
It's nothing.
Let's move.
 I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
Stop it.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
It would seem like this would be an opportune time for something nasty to happen. A couple of life's peripheral characters to be... well... offed.
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
Just an observation.
Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
Duck!!!
What the!?
Whoa!!!
Look out!
DON'T!
YOU'LL HIT US!
Aahhhh!!!
Come get a taste!
Take it Bitch-Beast!
Let's go!
Wait God-dammit!
I fucking knew it!
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
Just move!
 OHH Fuck ME!
Stop!
What was that?
Oh boy.
Go back! Go back! Go back!
Move jackass!!!
Stop pushing!
We're gonna make it --
Good lord!
Come on!
Eat it!!!
DOOR! DOOR! DOOR! OPEN THE DOOR!
COME ON! HURRY!
COME ON!
Look out!
Sorry about the rest of the family.
Prepare to join 'em!
Oh shit.
Hey! Send it up! Send it up!
Hey! Hey! He's in the shaft!
Move it! Move it! Move it!
NASTY FUCKERS!
Come on!
He's dead.
Shut up!
God-dammit!
It stopped. It fuckin' stopped!
Do something!
I'M ALIVE! OPEN THE DOOR!
Stop!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
HE CAN MAKE IT!
I will not die because of him!
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
They'll get in! We'll all die!
Smile!
Welcome back.
F-f-fuck you.
What the hell happened?
You okay?
They were all over the place.
You smell like ass!
We shot a skunk.
We're lucky to be alive.
Yeah, maybe.
 Get something on that.
 Don't do that again.
 What now, Geronimo?
My truck.
Didn't you see what just happened, dick wad? They own this place.
Not necessarily. You said we had five in the beginning? And now there's two still in the basement?  I think we have enough firepower to get outta here. That's not bad, our odds are getting better. Right?
If you ask me, I'm gonna just lay right here, wait for sunrise, then walk on out of here.
OHHH!!!
UGHHHHH!!!
Get on the tables!!! ON THE TABLES!!!!
CRAP!
Sweety!
Oh!
Hold on!
Helllllp!!!
HELP MEEE!
BONSAI!
Hot potato!!!
Stop!!! Stop!!! Stop!!!
You're into this aren't you?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
Let's wait it out.
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
There's a delivery tunnel out the back door.
We line everyone up in the tunnel, light the flares, toss the fire bombs, and then come out blasting.
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
What's in the back?
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
So what do we have to do?
IT'S ANOTHER GOD-DAMNED BOTTLE NECK!
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
But not flush against the tunnel?
How many feet will we be exposed? Without any cover?
I dunno... a few yards.
I don't like it.
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
You got something better?
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
Bullshit.
No bullshit.
Who's for the truck?
We'll be food, dickheads!
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
 You gotta be with me on this.
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Amazing you made it this far.
 It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
It's the safest place until sunrise.
You seem mighty collected about this.
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
Well aren't you stoic.
Not everyone's gonna be able to shoot at those things, you know.
That's right. Rubber legs, baldy, honey pie, gramps, stumpy, and "no son" ain't gonna be of much use, so you better think of something better.
I've killed two. How many have you killed?
You know, you don't sweat much for a fat chick.
Hot shit!!!
What the hell's your problem!? You trying to kill me!?
Right.
We're gonna die!
What the hell!
Stop shooting! Stop shooting! All they did was pull the power!
Clever fuckers.
What the hell's going on here!?
I heard something!
They're pacing. It sounds like they're pacing down there.
Shut up! Everyone shut up!
STAY QUIET.
They're figuring out where we're sitting.
OH JESUS!
HELP!
Get up! MOVE! MOVE!
Hold your fire!
We gotta go!
What are they doing!?
She's calculating...
We got company!
Who is it?
It's a sheriff!
He's fucked.
Someone do something!
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
Look out! Look out!
Get out of here! Get out of here! Get the fuck outta here!
No! Don't let him go!
Call for help!
Oh god! They're gonna get him!
Oh Jesusss!
NOOOOOO!
We should go! We should go right now!
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
Let's roll.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Am I too heavy for you?
Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
We should stick together out there.
I'd love to.
Are they still out there?
Jesus...
What?
I don't know, they're doin' something.
SHE'S CALLING FOR HELP!
The fan has officially been buried in the shit!
Come on!
Maybe next time, dear.
Light the flares toss them! Fire everything you've got!
RUN!
Honey pie!!!
Keep her!
Come on!!!
My leg!
Go! Go!
Not without you!!!
Go!!!
Burn you bitch!
Stay together! There can't be more than a few of them out there!
FLARES! Shoot the flares!
PICK IT UP!
Get in! Hurry!
Fuck!
Come on! They're all in!
 I'll cover!
 Move this girl!
 Under attack! Under attack! Can anyone hear me!? We're under attack!!!
Look out!
HUH --
Blow the goddamn hatch!
Clear!
Get to your cars!
GO-GO-GO!!
OH NO! GIVE HIM BACK!
 Keep moving, he's dead!
OH JESUS!
HELLLPPP!
I thought we lost you --
You FUCKERS!
 Get in! Get in!
 Get in!
AHHHHHHHH!!
DO IT!
Get me FUCK BIRDS!
No you don't!
VENGEANCE!
 Oh Jesussss...
Help me! HELP ME SOMEBODY!
HANG ON!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Get away from meeeee!
NOOO!!!
AHH!!!
Oh god! Oh god! Oh god!
COME ON! GOD-DAMMIT!
Look out!
Shit!
 I meant to tell you so much!
AHHHH!
Close your eyes, hon.
 WOOOO HAAA!!!
 Fuck!!!
AHHHH!!!
Help me! Help me!
I'll give you gas cocksucker.
Did we make it?
I think --
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
They'll be back.
Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
We're safe until dark, but we need to get to that bomb shelter.
You know where it is?
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
We'll meet in three hours?
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
Don't worry about that. Just go.
Right.
 I'm sorry about your son.
Thank you.
Where are you two going?
We're going to get my little girl.
I wish you luck.
Oh no...
They're alive!
I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...
It's right up there, in the back of the store.
 Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
Where is everyone?
I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?
She's supposed to already be here.
Your family?
I'm sorry.
Hey!
I'm glad to see you! This is a ghost town!  Did you find your girl?
 Over there!
Charlie!
Charlie!
Hold it!
Honey!?
CHARLIE? CHARL --
NOOOOO!
Back up!!!
Charlie! Charlie! No!
Oh god.
Well, I'll be damned...
