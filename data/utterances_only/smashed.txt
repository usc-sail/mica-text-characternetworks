That was so good, baby!
Bullshit.
I'm serious. You sing like an angel -- a drunk angel.
If you were writing about my performance for your blog, what would you say?
I'd say that, uh...my wife is the sexiest, most amazing woman alive.
That would be such a shitty article -- nobody would read it.
 Aw...we need to find you a lady, Owen.
Yeah -- I've been trying to flirt with the bartender, but...I can't tell.
She's hot! What can't you tell?
She looks like she could kick my ass. No way would she go for a guy like me.
You're being a little girl -- just go talk to her.
 I don't know...forget about it.
 I'll take point -- follow me.
I want to buy a gimlet for me and a double-shot of whiskey for my brother-in-law `cause he's had a hard week.
`Kay.
That's fifteen.
Wait -- don't you wanna know what happened to him?
 What happened?
He just got back from England -- because he went there for a girl! A preppy, bitchy girl. Diane Court...that was her name. He loved her so much that he went with her because she had a fellowship or something. He gave up being a kickboxer. A kickboxer!                               *  And she dumped him.
 You kickbox?
 Yeah.
 And he teaches kids at the kickboxing studio. Oh, they're so cute!
 A lot of `em don't have parents -- so...it's kinda more than just a teacher/student thing.  I know it sounds silly, but I feel responsible for them -- like...  ...I could be their parent.
 I think I got him laid.
Yeah?
She seems totally game.
Sure she just didn't want to get into your pants?
I think I'm done for the night.
Yeah?
She's seen "Say Anything."
Eh, well...what're you gonna do, huh?  Wanna drive us home?
No -- he needs to keep working it!         * You guys stay here.
I don't want to watch my brother not score. I want to go to bed with you and... (whispered into Kate's ear) ...you know.
I'll be home when you get there. We can "you know" then.
 Yeah, man -- you don't have a job to wake up for in the morning or anything.
Writing is a job! Not having to report to an office only makes work harder.  Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen should take us home -- you're too drunk to drive.
So's Owen.  I'm not that drunk. Besides, you know I focus when I drive -- it sobers me up.
Tell that to the cops.
 I love you, baby. I'll be waiting for you in a nice warm bed. You have exactly one mission: get your brother laid -- and don't talk to any other women.
That sounds like two missions.
No, it's just one.
 It kinda sounded like two, right?
 It did.
 GoodbyeIloveyouboth!
You okay?
 Yeah. Are you?
 Um...sure.
Good.  Hey, I'm not really okay.
Oh...
My bitch sister just took off and left me here so she could hook up with some asshole. Now what am I supposed to do? Huh? I don't have a car here.
I guess I could...
You'll give me a ride? Oh my god! Thank you!
I was gonna say "call you a cab," `cause, you know -- I don't even know you.
It's not far. Please? Pretty please...?
You know, you shouldn't drink and drive.
I wasn't --
Just kidding. Can I have a sip?
I'm really thirsty.
It's, uh...whiskey.
Fuck yeah, it's whiskey! I love whiskey. You're the real thing, huh? A hardcore drinking bitch like me!
I don't know. No.
Can I smoke in your car?
 Okay, fine -- go ahead. Can you just roll down the window?
Of course -- I'm not uncivilized.
 WHOA!
Not what I thought you meant.
Want a hit?
No, I...is that pot?
 Of course not! What do I look like? A stoner? 
 It's crack.
Oh, shit! No...no thank you.
C'mon -- it's good crack.
I don't, um...I've never smoked crack.
 Really? This stuff is the truth -- and it'll sober you up.
Uh...I think you should go.
I'm not getting out in the middle of nowhere. Do you know what could happen to me all alone out here at                     * night?
I don't know -- people might offer you crack?
Seriously? It's not a big deal -- just take a little hit.
I said no.
One hit won't hurt you. It'll sober you up.
 Smoke me!
One puff. Then we are both going home.
Fine.
You've got money, right?
 ...'cause I feel like I understand what it's like to be homeless, ya know? I mean, if you didn't know me, if we hadn't connected tonight, you might think: "There's some upper-middle-class, NPR listening, self-congratulatory, insulated, lazy liberal bitch. Probably never had to worry about anything." But that's not true at all! I grew up poor, man. Single mother. McDonald's used to have one day a week where they sold 29 cent hamburgers, and another day where they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My mom and me would go there and she'd get twenty burgers -- that was the limit, probably set up for folks just like us -- and then she'd put `em in the freezer and we'd microwave `em for dinner throughout the week. 
I was kinda overweight until high school, to be perfectly honest. Eating used to be my thing. When I started drinking, though, I kinda stopped eating so much.  But anyway, the point is: You and me, we're not so different.
 Huh?!
Shhh...it's okay, baby. Go back to sleep.
What happened? I came home and you were gone and I waited and waited.
It's a long story.
I was worried. I kept calling you.
I ended up...
You smell funny. What do you smell like?
I fell asleep in my car. Near the bar. I was too drunk to drive.
So, why didn't you come back or call me?
Charlie --  -- I'm fine.
Well, maybe I'm not. I worry, baby. I love you -- and you know how you get sometimes.
I love you too. But I'm home. It's over. I gotta get to work.
I can't be worried about you all the time.
Don't worry so much. I'm fine.  C'mon -- let me get you to bed.
I'm up now -- how `bout I make us bacon and egg sandwiches?
 Magic words.
Check for your mom's on the table.
Thanks, baby.
Why does the coffee taste so much better when you make it?
Because I make it with love -- and bacon.
 Now, if I add a "C," what word do I have?
Yes, Hillary?                                         *
Can?
That's correct! Can. You've won an all-expenses paid trip to the blackboard, Hillary!                                  *
C'mon...there's a washer-dryer combo in it for you.
Great job, Hillary -- let's give                      * her a round of applause!
Can anyone use "can" in a sentence?
Yes?
"Hurry up in there -- I gotta use the can!"
 Wonderful, Angela. You get a Camaro with flames painted on the hood.
Now --  -- what's another word I could make by adding a letter to "an"?
C'mon...
Yes -- Ramon?
P.
P...okay, what word would that make if I added a "P"?
Um...pan?
Pan! That's right. Ramon Martinez...COME ON DOWN!
Wow! Just look at that excellent penman --
EW! GRODY! GROSS! YUCK! IT SMELLS LIKE CHEESE! SLOPPY JOE! GRANDPA! SHRIMP! BACON!
 I'm so sorry you had to see that.
Mrs. Hannah -- are you pregnant?
What?
My mommy threw up when she was pregnant with my little sister. Are you pregnant?
Are you?
Yes.
Vice Principal Davies will be looking after your students for the rest of the day -- so you don't need to worry about that.
Oh, that's really good to know. I'll have to thank him.  I just feel awful for getting sick in front of my students.
Oh, please -- they're troopers. I'm sure they've seen plenty worse.  So -- how long have you been pregnant?
Um...it's the first trimester.
Well, it's very exciting. You must be thrilled.
 Uh-huh.
Can I ask a...personal question?
Okay.
How's it...  ...going for you?
Huh?
The pregnancy, I mean.
Having kids wasn't in the cards for me. I came close, but...
...I mean, it's like I've got a couple hundred kids here --  -- but...I don't fool myself. It's not the same.
 Well...it's hard to explain.
Of course...
I wouldn't call it a burden, but --
It's a responsibility.
Yeah. Exactly.
 You're so lucky.  Can I...touch it?
Um, I don't...okay -- but it sleeps a lot.
Of course.
Like...a lot.
 Hello in there. Can you hear me? You're a tiny miracle. Did you know that? A miracle.
 Thank you.
Is everything, um...okay, Mrs. Hannah?
Yeah, well...I'm really embarrassed -- but I feel a lot better. And I just wanted to say thank you.
Look -- I'm not a fool.  I know you were drinking this morning.
I saw you.
 Oh, no, I...
Drinking when you're pregnant is really dangerous.
I know that! Oh, God, I...  ...listen -- I'm not actually pregnant.
What?
I'm just really hung over. The kids started asking me questions after I vomited and I panicked.
Oh. That's...not good.
I know. I...please don't say anything.
Just...go home. Get some sleep.
I had such a crappy morning.
Me too. I spent like three hours at the post office trying to buy stamps and stuff.
I told my class I was pregnant.
 Oh, baby, that's --
I'm not. Pregnant. So don't worry.
 Oh.  `Cause it would be great news -- if it was true.  `Course then I'd have to drink your beer...
Well, it was a lie. I just lied to my class. After barfing in front of them.
 Ooh...
Yeah, that's what they said.  Listen...I can't do this anymore.
What do you mean?
I dunno. I think I might...drink too much.
Oh. That. Yeah...you kinda do.
I know I do -- I'm a fucking mess...
Baby -- that's not true. You're beautiful. And brilliant. And I love you. I wouldn't be married to a "mess."
I left work after puking in front           * of little kids. And...now I'm               * drinking in the middle of the day.          *
Well, those things happen sometimes.  I mean, they shouldn't happen all the time, but...it's the price of, uh, truly living life.
Isn't that like a slogan for some kind of beer or toothpaste or something...?
No. And it's true -- you and me, we're not just some boring couple in the suburbs who don't sleep with each other and have nothing to talk about except whatever TV show they're currently into.  We, like...still know how to party.
Yeah...  ...I think I need to slow down.  And I might need help.
I'll help you.
I know, but...I might need more help.
Yeah? Like a therapist?
I don't know -- I just get stupid when I'm drunk, and I'm drunk a lot.
We just like to have a good time.
Yeah, well...  ...you've gotta promise not to tell this to anyone.
 I promise.
That includes Owen.
Of course.
Well, last night I kinda, um...  ...smoked some crack.
WHAT?!
After I left the bar, I, uh, picked up this drunk girl and...I don't really remember what came next, but I ended up smoking crack with her.
 Uh...how's that even happen?  You give someone a ride and she rewards you with crack?!
Well...she seemed desperate. She really needed a ride home.
Where?
Downtown. I think she maybe lives in...a tent?
What?
Well...she might be homeless. Or a prostitute. Or just some lost sorority girl.  To be honest, I'm not sure...
 Oh, my god...you smoked crack with some random stranger? Did you...share a pipe?
Ughhh...  Just playing Devil's advocate, but maybe it's the crack-smoking you need help with and not the drinking.
I'm just saying.
The drinking led to the crack- smoking. The drinking leads to everything stupid I do.  I mean...can you even remember the last time we had sober sex?
We'll chill out with the booze for a while. We can just be wine-with-                   * dinner people.  How's that sound?
Maybe you should go to, uh... one of those meetings. They have `em over there.
Yeah, right.
Remember when I was shit-faced and took that Q & A pamphlet from there?
 Holy shit! And we answered "yes" to like every question and at the end it was like, "If you answered `yes' to any of these you're an alcoholic!"
Yeah...  ...that was fun, wasn't it?
Hey --
-- look out for that crack!
What crack?
Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a crack there...  ...but you must have smoked it last night.
"Have you missed days of work or school because of drinking?"
Absolutely.
"Do you envy people who can drink without getting into trouble?"
Envy isn't exactly the right word...
"Do you have `blackouts'?"
Yeah, but who doesn't?
"Has your drinking caused trouble at home?"
No! We're great.
Yeah. Definitely. But we still had a lot of "yes" answers.  Yep...we still qualify as drunks.
I'm gonna go!
 Yeah, right.
No -- I'm serious! I'm gonna go. What time is it?
Eight.
See ya.
 Uh-huh...
 This is me: going.
You've been boozing.
So? You should come too!
Yeah, right. You can't go to AA wasted. It's like a rule or something.
Oh, yeah? Watch me!
 Hey, I'm Donovan. Welcome.
Hi Donovan -- I'm Kate!
You must be a newcomer, huh?
A what?
 Um, I'm not really allowed to talk to new chicks, but there are lots of women here who can help you out.
 Okay.  Do I just sit wherever?
The meeting already started so just try to find a spot anywhere.
Are you new?
To this? Yeah. Why's everyone whispering?
It's hard, huh?
I guess.
Everything's going to be fine. You're home.
Not to embarrass anyone, but so that we may get to know you better - - is there anybody here in their first thirty days of recovery?
I'm Kate. I...I'm...I guess I'm a little drunk right now.
Do you want me to talk about my childhood or something?
 You know, Kate, we actually ask that you don't share if you've had                  * a drink or any mind-altering substance in the past 24 hours.
 I can -- I kinda hate my dad and don't talk to him. And my mom...oh, man...I don't even know where to start. She's, like, stuck in the 80's and kind of a metalhead. Her last boyfriend called himself a drummer but really just gave drum lessons to little kids and --
 Welcome, Kate.  It gets better.
 I like drinking is the thing. I mean, I don't want to say you guys are wrong or anything...
Thank you -- we're all here to help. We do have to move on, though.
Don't worry, sweetie -- there'll be plenty of time to tell your story.
Hey, I'm Amber, alcoholic. I can't really believe that it's been five years. I mean, my life was a mess back then. Now I'm back in school, I have an amazing man, I love my parents -- it's crazy...
 How old is that girl?! Can she even go to bars?  How old are you, Amber?
Be respectful.
 Um...okay? It's because I did the work. I got down on my knees and prayed every night! I went to a meeting everyday!
Everyday?
It wasn't easy, but I've gotta say, I owe everything to AA. Well, AA -- and God, of course!
God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change -- courage to change the things I can - - and wisdom to know the difference.
AMEN!
 Okay...I think I'm good.
So much for that.
Was it a bunch of old biker guys?
No, it was...I don't know. Enthusiastic people. A lot of really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE!
Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm sorry it wasn't cool.
I can't really imagine never drinking. I guess I don't have to, though --  -- you're the one with the problem.
Hey -- I love you. I don't want you to have to drink.
I don't have to drink.  I just really like to drink.                            *
 Good -- `cause you're my favorite person to drink with in the whole damn world.
Oh, no you didn't!
Are you trying to have some sex?
You know I can't sell you this, Kate.
What? You can't tell I'm 21? Come on -- I'm in here all the time. You know me.
Yes, I do, Kate. And I know you're old enough -- but it's too late.
C'mon -- we can just pretend it's before two...
 Stop it.
It's just a little wine. I'm not driving or anything.
I don't think so. Sorry.
Come on, dude -- I'll let you have a sip if you want.
It's the law. I can't sell alcohol after 2 a.m. You know that.
Why don't you give it to me, then? That wouldn't hurt anything. A gift -- because we're friends.
I could lose my job.
 You distract him, okay?!
Look -- why don't you get a bottle of water or a coffee or something instead?
Water or coffee? Fuck you. What -- just cause I won't suck your dick?
 Oh my god. Okay, enough -- you gotta go.
Seriously, Kate. You should go.
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
This is bullshit!  I have to pee.
What the fuck are you doing?!
 I didn't mean to! Sometimes I just have to pee really, really bad.                         *
 Get outta here NOW!
 C'mon...can't we drink together?
Charlie!
 Not again.
Come back to bed, baby.
I have to go to work. You snoozed my alarm again. I'm gonna be late.
Well, you peed on me so I guess                     * we're even.                                         *
I have a weak bladder.
Well...I can't go to work like this.
You work from our kitchen.
Yeah, but changing the sheets is my real job.  Hey -- where were you last night?
Huh?
I woke up at like 4 a.m. and you were gone.
Where would I go at 4 a.m. alone? You must've been dreaming.
I...
I can only imagine the chemistry experiment that's going on --
 -- in there.
Are you gonna have a boy or a girl?
I don't know yet.
When will you know?
Not until summertime. You guys will be on vacation.
If you have a boy what will you name him?
Maybe...Woodrow Wilson?
That's a name for a man -- not a baby!
Thanks again for covering for me.
I can't promise to cover for you every time you get pregnant.
There won't be another time.
I genuinely hope not. Look -- I didn't tell Barnes, but if anything like this happens again I'll have to.
Okay...Kate?
 Okay...  ...David?
Dave.
I know -- Dave Davies...yup...hah- hah. Anyway, uh, is everything okay with you?
I don't know.  Um...no? 
I puked in front of my class and then told everyone I'm pregnant. That's not really okay, huh?
No, I don't think so.
I went to AA last night.
 Oh, yeah? What'd you think of it?
It was awful. I kept getting shushed.
I don't normally tell people I work with this... but --
-- I'm a bit of an expert when it comes to these things.
 You?
Yeah, me. I've lived a strange one.                    * I'm nine years sober, AA and NA.  I used to drink cocaine. (off Kate's shocked expression) It's really cheap in the Philippines.
Listen, Kate. I know meetings can be weird. Especially at first, but if you want to...you never need to feel like you have to...but the ones I go to are pretty small. Nice little groups.  I'd be happy to take you.
Maybe that would be good...I don't know.
No pressure, okay. That shit saved my life, though.
 Well, I'm scheduled to observe Ms. Carol's art class. They're making macaroni art, so...I'm pretty stoked.
 Mrs. Hannah -- I've got something for you...
Folic Acid! You need it now like never before.
 Thanks.
I bet your mother is over the moon, huh? Probably planning you a baby shower...?
Oh, well...she and I aren't that close.
Oh, I'm sorry. Well, listen -- any motherly thing you need -- I'm                       * here, okay?
Now drink up -- that baby in there's thirsty!
Okay. (takes a sip of orange juice) And...you're kinda the only person at school -- besides Mr. Davies -- who knows I'm pregnant. Could you...?
My lips are --
Hey...
Howdy.
How was your day? And what's that smell?
Eh -- alright. Couldn't find oatmeal so I made ketchup soup.
 Charlie! You need to eat.
What? It's tasty.  So...I'm going to see that band                      * from Iceland with the triplets play                  * tonight. Want to come with me and Owen to check it out?
Oh, that sounds fun, but...
C'mon -- Owen can't pick up girls without you.
I don't know...this guy I work with -- Mr. Davies --
The Vice Principal?
Yeah -- turns out he's sober and invited me to a meeting.
 Wow, that's...uh, cool.
What?
Nothing -- I just...I didn't think you really loved the meeting you went to yesterday. In fact, it sounded like you hated it. So I'm kinda surprised you're going back.
Well...this is a smaller meeting. It might be different. I dunno -- I think I want to give it a fair shot.
Besides -- I was hammered last night.  Go on and have fun out drinking with Owen tonight. Seriously. I'm just gonna, you know, try something         * different...
I'm here for you, okay? Even though I drink -- I could slow down if you need me to.  I'm sure I could.
This is a little more my speed. No one here is the slightest bit hip.
Does everybody just...kinda, you know -- talk here?
Pretty much. Someone leads -- tells their story. And then everyone else shares -- talks.
So since you're taking me here does that make you my sponsor?
No -- I don't think I could do                     * that.  `Cause, um...  ...well, it could get weird. But                   * I'll help you find one if you want.  We should sit down.
 I can't believe I'm really here.
It gets better. Weirder, maybe -- but better.
...all I knew about taking care of myself was fucking people over and lying to get by. I had no idea how to even look for a normal job or pay my bills on time -- or pay my fucking bills at all.  Now I pay my bills online.
And I found a love in cooking. I've                * got my own catering business now.                  * And...maybe I just replaced alcohol with chocolate chips and cigarettes, but still...it's been years since I woke up in a park -- in a different state.
I kinda like her.
Sponsor potential?
Get her number at break.
I feel like you're my wingman.
Arlo, Alcoholic. There'll now be a ten minute break. Smoke em' if you got em.
Hey, I liked your speech.
Thanks. All that dumb shit happened so I'm glad that now it's at least entertaining.  What's your name?
Kate. This is my first meeting. Or... first meeting where I'm not wasted.
Oh, yeah -- I remember doing some of that.
I don't really know how this stuff works. 
But...could I get your number? I mean, I may not need it, but...
Yeah, of course. I can help explain it to you -- and also, we can just talk.
Okay. Yeah.  You've been sober since you were 24?
That seems really young.
I didn't have much of a choice -- I crashed my car into a nursing home.  I think the break is just about over. This meeting is the kind where everyone can share. Sharing always helps me, so...if it's not too weird -- try introducing yourself and telling the group what's going on.
...anyway, that's where I'm at today. Thanks for listening.
Okay, um...hello. I'm Kate and...  ...I'm an alcoholic?
Hi, Kate.
Sorry. I don't mean to laugh -- it's just saying those words...  ...I think I'm an alcoholic, but I don't really know. I drink -- a lot. I've always drank. Everyone I know drinks a lot. I never really thought I had a problem -- lately though it seems like maybe I do. I just want to be able to drink a beer without it turning into twenty -- or wetting my bed.  It seems like every time I drink something awful happens. All the shit that I used to laugh off isn't really funny anymore. The dumb drunk stuff has gone from embarrassing to scary.  I'm kinda...scared.
A SERIES OF short, quick scenes:
How about ninety days?
Is there anyone here who has ninety days of continuous sobriety?
I'm Kate. I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Kate.
 Congratulations.
I'm really proud of you, Kate.
I kinda can't believe it's been ninety days.  The longest I've gone since high school without drinking was, like, a week.
My first three months were such hell. I think I'm only sober today because I just never want to go through that again.
It's weird -- in after-school specials the getting-sober part was only like a minute of the movie and suddenly...daddy's all okay.
But it's so fucking hard and weird and suddenly I have all these other problems now that drinking isn't the problem.
Like what?                                  *
Everything else. Work, my non- existent relationship with my mom...
When was the last time you saw her?
 A year, at least.
Well...maybe it's time.
Maybe.  And then there's my marriage. I mean, Charlie's great. Really great, he's supportive, especially at first. It's strange, though. I feel like alcohol was the thing that connected us and now that I don't drink we lead these two very different lives.  We haven't slept together in forever...  I haven't pissed myself in awhile, though. So that's good.
It takes time.
 Keep working the steps.  Let's grab coffee tomorrow, okay? I should actually run you home now and come back. I need to start locking up.
I could stick around and help you...
 I could take you home.  If you want.
My ex-wife -- she doesn't drink -- well, not like us, but as soon as I got sober I started to change and she just...didn't.
I didn't know you were married.
Yeah, I was married once --  -- in my other life. But I shouldn't be talking to you about this stuff.
Why?
I don't know...
Because you're a dude we can't talk? I don't get that "men stick with men, women stick with women" stuff.
Well, if you were sitting where I'm sitting you'd understand.
Are you trying to tell me that you have a crush on me?
What am I, one of your students?            * Crush?
Yeah, crush.
 I kind of do, yes. I have a crush on you. I know that's wrong -- you're newly sober and married and I shouldn't be thinking about you like that. But yeah, I should put that out on the table.  Honesty.
It's okay. I think you're a really good guy.
Oh, great -- good guys are the nerds that carry the pretty girls' books.
Oh, c'mon...
I think you're beautiful.
And smart, and sexy, and cool...
And I know it's wrong, but -- in meetings I stare at your lips and your legs and all I can think about is fucking your moist pussy.
 Oh, crap! I don't know why I just said that. I'm really, really sorry.
WHAT THE FUCK?
 Oh, that was a bad thing to say, right?
YES.
I'm so, so sorry. I'm just confused, and I don't know how to talk to women --
Jesus -- you can't just go around telling people you want to fuck their "moist pussy."  Who even says that?
I'm really sorry.
I have to go inside my house -- where I live with my husband.  Thanks for your creepy version of honesty.
You okay?
 Yep -- I'm just pacing myself. The tortoise wins the race.
Actually, I'm not really in the mood.
But I wanted to give you a 90 days gift.
It's okay -- the 90 days was the gift.
Sorry if I was doing a bad job -- I'm kinda hammered.
It's alright. Charlie...  ...I miss you.
Huh?                                                *
I mean...I don't know. I don't really feel connected to you anymore.
Did I do something?
No.  We don't talk that much.
We used to talk, but now you come home and go to meetings and by the time you get back I'm --
Kinda drunk.
I was gonna say "tired."
There's some stuff I need to do this weekend. I think I'm gonna go up to Lake Arrowhead.
Really? To see your mom?
Why?
 Do I need a reason?
With your mom? Kinda.  Is this the "amends" step?
No.
Well then why're you going?
 We send her checks. But we never actually see her. Sometimes it feels like I'm paying her to not be in my life. I thought it would be nice to visit her.  And Jenny thinks it would be a good         * idea.
What?
I don't know...I mean, do you do everything your sponsor tells you to do?
No. Do you think I'm brainwashed or something?
I dunno...it's been a long damn time since you've seen your mom.  And you didn't listen when I suggested we visit her.
 Oh, baby -- I listen to you. This just...it felt like the right time.  With all the changes I'm going through.
Well, can I come with you? It'll be like a little vacation.
Um...I think I should go alone.
Come on, if you do that you'll just get depressed. If I go we can try to make it fun. Go hiking and stuff.
Well, if you go, don't take this the wrong way but -- I'd like it if maybe you didn't drink.  Just while we're there.
 I think I can handle not drinking for like a day.
Ah...the lawn-gnomes. I missed those guys.
 Hi, Holger!
So...we gonna go in?
 I should've brought something.
You're fine.
Something, you know? Flowers, or...
Wine?
No. Definitely not that.
 Go on...
S'minute!
 Oh, God...
 Katie!
What're you doing here?
I left you a message, mom.
Oh, you know I don't check that thing. (notices Charlie; slightly flirty) Hello there, young man.
Hi, Ms. Foster.
Well, then...  ...what a lovely surprise -- you two came to visit. Hell has frozen over.  Just kidding. Come inside -- let me fix you both some drinks.
Just water for me.
...you wouldn't believe how much the neighborhood's changed! After Mr. Baker passed away and the kids put Mrs. Baker in a home, the people that moved in, oof!
It's like they don't even understand the concept of birth control in their country!
 If you ask me, I think it's a meth house.  They've always got those little five year old twins "playing" in the yard, but I'm pretty sure they're the lookouts.
That's pretty wild, mom.
Right? (notices that Kate hasn't touched her drink) What's wrong, honey? Think I forgot how to mix `em?
I told you I just wanted water.
Oh, please! Where I'm from, "no" means "yes."  Am I right or am I right?
 Huh-huh...
That's actually why I wanted to come up, mom.  I stopped drinking.
 Are you telling me I'm going to be a grandma?
Oh -- that's so exciting! I'm gonna be a grandma!  And you know that "no drinking when you're pregnant" thing is just a myth. I drank plenty when I was pregnant with Kate -- and look how she turned out!
I'm not pregnant, mom.
Oh.
I just needed a break. I'm sober for the first time in years.
Well...  ...we'll see how long that lasts.
It's been a while, actually.
 90 days.
 You've sure picked the right partner --  -- for this little mission.
 Hey -- I'm not drinking either...today.
 Drink if you want to, Charlie.  Charlie didn't stop drinking. I'm doing it by myself.  And...I started going to 12-step meetings.
Ah...yes. Assholes Anonymous.  Katie's father went to those meetings a few years after we got married. Dried up. Left me. You can see how well that worked out for me... (Rochelle gestures to her living room) ...I raised his daughter in this PALACE while he's somewhere in Florida with his shiny new wife and kids.  Bastard.  You better be careful -- they change.
I thought you'd be happy for me, mom.
Oh...I'm sorry -- I'm not being a good hostess, am I?
I'll microwave you your favorite.
I'm sorry if I acted like a bitch.
It's okay, mom. I know you can't help it.
This place shut down a decade ago and then there was a fire and now it's basically abandoned.
We came here every year the week before Christmas. 
And then I worked here in high school -- selling hot chocolate. And they had real reindeer, too. They kept `em over there.
My mom worked here when she was younger. I think everyone who grew                  * up around here worked at Santa's Village at some point.
This is what I think of when I think of Christmas.  Thanks for coming up here with me.
Of course.
I'm sorry my mom's so awful.
 She just can't handle her liquor.
Did you ever hook up with guys when you worked here?
Huh?
You know -- sneak off with a co- worker and do it against a pine tree or something?
Um...no.
I mean, if I were a teenage boy working with a stone cold fox like you I'd totally want to hook up with you here. Like...in the ginger bread house.
You were probably the coolest girl in town -- and the prettiest. I'm sure everyone was in love with you.
SURPRISE!
I couldn't keep quiet. Sorry. I just had to tell everyone so we could celebrate.
 Oh...you shouldn't have.
You don't have to thank me -- just open your presents!
Wow...
Go ahead.
`C'mon, Kate! You're gonna love what I got you! Is it a boy or a girl?
 Oh, it's so...nice.
 It's to hang over the crib!
Uh-huh...
Mmmm...it's so moist.
Kate!
Kate?
 What?
Listen -- I am so, so sorry. You have no idea how much this has been eating me up.
What you said to me was really fucked up.
I know.
What were you even thinking?
I wasn't -- I was just...I try to be really honest.
I get that. But you can't force your "honesty" on everyone you know.
 I'm flattered that you have...feelings for me. I am. But I'm married.
I know. I'm sorry. I'll apologize to your husband if you want.
No -- you don't have to do that. I didn't even tell him. But...you can't say that to a girl -- like, ever.
Okay.
Seriously. Consider that a rule of thumb.  Someday, you're gonna meet a nice, available lady -- but if you say "moist pussy" to her, you will never, ever, ever get to see that part of her body!
 Okay.  Thank you.  I feel like this was a really good talk.
...getting married would fucking                     * suck. I can't even imagine waking                    * up to the same person for the rest                   * of my life.                                          *
What's up, Kate?                Hey, Kate.
I see you guys found the birthday                    * cake Jenny and I baked.                              *
Yeah, thanks! You should get a                       * slice.                                               *
* I, uh...kinda thought we'd all eat           * it together.                                 *
Baby -- I didn't even think about            * that. I'm sorry.                             *
It was really good.                          *
We have plenty of tequila to make            * up for the cake.                             *
Kate's in AA -- so she can't drink.          * She hasn't drank in forever -- like          * thirty-eight days or some shit.              *
Ninety-five days, actually.                  *
That sucks! Do you still smoke               * weed?                                        *
No, I wasn't a big weed smoker               * anyway.                                      *
You smoked crack though, didn't              * you?                                         *
Shit -- I hear crack gets you so             * high!                                        *
No -- my wife doesn't smoke crack.           * Jesus...                                     *
What? I'm joking around. I know              * Kate's not a crackhead or some               * shit.                                        * * It was just that one time, right?            *
* Thanks, Charlie.                                        *
* It's your birthday, man, so I'm not                     * gonna make a big deal out of this --                    * but you need to shut the fuck up                        * sometimes.                                              *
Listen -- I'm sorry. He's drunk...really drunk.
I'm not mad at him -- I'm mad at you! You said you wouldn't tell anyone about what I did.
I'm...sorry. I...was drunk too when I told him.
Great.  Why don't you guys just go to the bar now?
You wanna come?
I'm hanging here.
I'm sure they have near-beer, baby. It'll be fun.
I'm staying in.
That sounds like a lot of fun.
Bye.
I love you.
I love you...?
Yeah...  ...I love you too.
Yes?
Mrs. Hannah -- shouldn't you be more fatter?
What?
`Cause of the baby. My mom got real fat.
 Well..."Shouldn't you be fatter?" is the correct way to ask that question.
Now, one day when you're very old and wise fourth graders, you'll learn about multiplication and --
Mrs. Hannah -- Shouldn't you be more fat?
Well, I...
...I'm not going to have a baby.
OOOH!
See -- I was pregnant but, it wasn't my time, I suppose...
Mrs. Hannah -- did you kill the baby?
WHAT? No -- of course not!
`Cause my mom says that when you kill a baby you go to hell and you can't even go to church to ask god for forgiveness.
Mrs. Hannah -- are you going to hell?
No! I didn't kill my baby! Okay, listen kids -- we shouldn't be talking about this. But...  ...sometimes women get pregnant and then early on -- before it's even a baby -- they stop being pregnant.
Because a doctor murders it!
No -- not because a doctor   murdered it.  It's called a miscarriage.   That means it wasn't my plan --   it's just what happened.  Does anyone want to ask me   any questions?
Let's get back to subtraction -- or addition. Or both.
Well, that was bound to happen at some point. Kids notice things like that.
But I had no idea how pro-life little Winnie Reddy is.                        *  Remind me to wear my "May the fetus you save be gay" T-shirt to the next banana split night.
And just think: the kids got a lesson about life and death that nobody planned on. I mean, you're years ahead of the standard curriculum for, uh, third graders.
Does it matter that I lied? That I was never pregnant?
You want me to answer that as a friend or as someone who takes the twelve steps very seriously?
Well, the good thing is that it's all over now. Principal Barnes will think you're a martyr for losing a baby.  The kids won't ask about it anymore and as long as you don't toss your cookies again you won't have to deal with it.
 And the bad news?
You lied. To your boss -- and a bunch of small children. Who trust you. And rely on you to help them differentiate right from wrong.
 That's all, huh?
Well...  
...I gotta say -- this is the boringest meal I've had in about as long as I can remember.
Who're you texting?
 Jenny.                                      *
She's like a parole officer.
She's my sponsor.
I'm glad to know every little fuck- up I have is gonna become a topic of conversation with some chick I don't even know.
 So...what'd you do today, honey?
I finished some writing and met up with Owen to watch the game and toss a few back. Dear.  You do anything special?
I lied to my class again. I told them that I had a miscarriage.
That's not funny.
Yeah, it is. Telling kids fucked-up stuff is totally funny...in, you know -- a kinda fucked-up way.
Great, well -- I'm glad I'm not actually having a baby.
God, Kate -- come on. What else were you supposed to do?
Well, I feel like a piece of shit for lying.
It's not that big a deal. Jesus. Is this what those meetings teach you? To make drama out of nothing?
It's not nothing. I lied to little kids and to my boss because I can't take responsibility for my actions.
Why don't you go and tell the Principal that you were never pregnant? That the reason you puked is because you smoked crack all night? Would you feel better about yourself then?
I've been thinking about doing that, actually.  Yeah. I think I would feel better about myself.
Fine. Do it, then. I guess you don't need a job.
I could be like you -- I could stay home drinking all day and never do anything responsible.
 I never do anything responsible? What about buying this house that we live in? Or the food that we're eating?
Having rich parents doesn't make you responsible. I think it's pretty much done the opposite.
Oh, I'm sorry that I have a family that supports us -- and not the other way around.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Nothing, Kate. But you can't be mad at me because my family has helped us out. You should be grateful we don't have to struggle.
I wouldn't care if we struggled with money. I've struggled with money my whole life.  I'd rather worry about where my next meal is coming from than if I - - in some drunken stupor -- married a man who just wants to party and meet bands.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm talking about you being a baby. A selfish baby.
You know what?
What?
I fucking hate AA! It turned you into a bitch. A brain-washed bitch.
At least I'm not drunk all the time.
Yeah, you don't drink booze for three months and suddenly you're some saint? You have it all together and I'm just a baby?
I'm trying, Kate. I'm trying to understand you. But it's hard. You're different and maybe it's good that you're different. Maybe I'm bad and bad for you or something -- because I didn't think the person you were before was so awful. I loved that person. Yeah, she drank a lot and she did some silly things...but she was my Kate.
You loved that person? Do you not love me now?
Yeah, of course. But it's different. You're different.
Before I was a mess.  I'm finally getting my life together -- and you loved me more before?
 Kinda, yeah.
I feel so fucking weird right now -- Charlie doesn't love me like he used to and I've lied to my students multiple times. 
 I just don't feel...normal right now.
Well, you're not normal.  None of us are.
Everything in life isn't connected to being an alcoholic.
I'm not just talking about alcoholics.  People are fucking weird. We all have a lot of shit we carry around in our heads that doesn't make sense.  At least alcoholics have tools to work through it.                            *
"Steps"...
Yeah, steps -- and talking and listening and crying...
I have the crying part covered.
I know, right? I think my first year I cried tears I'd been saving since I was eight.  It's hard to live your life...honestly. You know?
Any idea what you're gonna do about your school situation? What you're gonna say?
I don't know what I'm gonna do about anything.
Listen...you wanna stay in my guest                     * room tonight? You can watch movies, get some good sleep...?
You sure that's okay?
Yeah, of course. That's why I spent money on a guest bed -- so people could sleep in it.  I know it might feel like it, but really, you don't have to figure everything out tonight.  You've got time.
I'm so sorry, Kate.  I haven't told many people this, but when I was young -- younger than you...I lost a child too.
I'm...I'm really sorry.
It's okay. It was a long, long time ago. Still hurts sometimes. But eventually...you move on. You have to.  Have a seat.
I got a phone call from a very upset parent. That's how I found out about...you know. Frankly, I'm not sure why you didn't feel like you could tell me.
I freaked out -- a student asked why I wasn't fat and I just froze up and then another student was saying I killed my baby and I didn't know what to do.
I'm not angry with you -- but I need to be clear that this doesn't happen again.
It won't. I promise that.
By "not happening again," I mean that you don't discuss any controversial topics -- things the school board deems "family matters" with your class.  No sex. No god. No drugs and alcohol.
Okay, I...
...I can't keep doing this. I feel awful.
 I know this all must be hard for you --
No. You don't understand.  I have to be honest with you.
What do you mean?
Principal Barnes...I wasn't ever pregnant.
I lied -- to the class and to you -- because I was scared.
But...you vomited in class.
I know. And when that happened I didn't know what to do because the truth is --
Oh, my god -- are you really ill? Is it cancer?
No, well, yes. I have a disease, but, um...  ...it's alcoholism.
What?
I've been working on it. I'm one- hundred days sober. When that happened I'd been out drinking and was hung over and --
You vomited in front of children because you were hung over?
Yes.
And lied, saying that you were pregnant?
Well, a student asked if I was pregnant -- and "yes" just kind of fell out of my mouth.
That's sick, Kate.
I know.
No, I don't think you understand how wrong that is. To lie to me -- to the children. You know I felt so terrible for you when I found out that you had a mis -- ?  -- how can you play with people's emotions like that?
I was sick.
Jesus...you told us you had a miscarriage.
I'm sorry.
I threw you a baby shower.
I'm really sorry. I am. I've been wanting to tell you the truth because honesty has become really important to me. I'm in AA now and doing the steps and working with a sponsor and everything.  It's really hard. I mean, I think my husband might hate me, and --
I'm sorry, but what you did is totally irresponsible.
I know.
 I can't have you here anymore.
 Am I being fired?
No, no -- the state wouldn't allow that without a report. I'm not going to write a report. Because, frankly, I have no idea what that report would say.  But I'm forcing you to take a leave of absence and I think it's in your best interest if you find a job elsewhere.
Listen -- I'm really sorry, but I'm doing the right things now.
I believe you -- or I want to. I really do. But honey -- I believed you before.  I'll have a sub take over your class starting tomorrow. It's late enough in the year that we can just say you're having personal problems
-- which seems to be the truth.
Principal Barnes --
Not another word. I'm upset right now -- very upset -- and I think I'm doing you a favor by not reporting you.
Thank you.
Kate -- what's going on?
I told Principal Barnes about everything.
 What? Everything? Did you tell her about...?
 Huh?  Oh, God -- no. I told her that I'm an alcoholic. And that I lied. And she fired me.
 Oh...  ...my god, Kate -- I'm sorry.
I've been going to AA and trying to be sober and this is what it got me.  Fired, for telling the truth.
I'm sorry. I wish there was something I could do.
I'm a fuck-up. I'll always be a fuck up. I'm just like my mom.
 No, no -- you're a wonderful, smart woman Kate. You can't let this get you down.
I gotta go.
Let me walk you to your car.
What do you need?
Whiskey. Double.
Can I have another one?
Sure -- you gotta pay for the first one, though. Eight bucks.
Look, Miss -- I don't wanna be a downer or anything `cause I take it you've had a bad day, but um... I think you need to go home.
Why?
Cause you're pretty drunk -- and it's four p.m.
What about him?
You're not kicking him out.
I'm just trying to be a pal.
Stop it -- you aren't my pal. I just got fired, and I just quit AA.  It didn't work.
Oh, boy...
You know what? I was fine -- had a husband that loved me and maybe I sometimes did embarrassing stuff, but it was a phase. 
I go to AA and sober my husband and I start fighting and stop fucking -- and sober I get fired! Isn't that what's supposed to not happen?
Wow, okay, well...I'm real sorry. But this place gets a little nuts after sundown and I don't think a pretty girl who just left AA should be here.  I'm gonna call you a cab.
NO! I don't want a cab. I want --  -- drugs. Can you hook me up?
C'mon...let's go out back and smoke some crack.
Lady, you're done.
You think I'm above smoking crack? `Cause I'm not. And are you really gonna tell me you're not a little attracted to me...?
No.
Just a teensy bit...?
Not in the slightest.
Well...you might want to consider investing in glasses, buddy. `Cause I'm a...a stone cold fox. And I'm smart. And I'm...
...a good person.
I think it's time for you to go home. Now are you gonna let me call a cab?
 NO! I'm not. I've got friends. They'll pick me up.
You do that.
I'll call Mr. Davies. He has dreams about me.
Hope that works out for you.
Can't believe my luck. I just want to get drunk and a bartender won't let me.  Life is stupid.
You hear me? Life is FUCKING STUPID!
Davey-wavey...I called you. Why'd you bring her?
We're worried about you, Kate.
 Parole officer.
She's your sponsor.
It's gonna be okay. You stumbled. You'll get back up.
How `bout we drive to Mexico and party our asses off? My treat.
 Sounds fucking stupendous, right?
Kate! Are you sure you're --
 Fuck off.
 Babe -- you gotta hear this with the speakers hooked up. It's insane.
Whoa...what happened to you?
I'm drunk. I'm fired from my job.
Oh, no...
We got any drinks?
Uh...we have soda. I can make coffee.
Don't be cute with me. You know what I mean.
So...I guess you aren't doing the AA thing anymore?
What gave that away?
Come on, baby -- let's do some shots.
What's going on?
I'm celebrating. What the fuck does it look like?
Are you gonna be a little girl or are you gonna drink with me?
I don't know what the right thing to do here is.
Okay, so let me see if this makes sense: you say you miss the old Kate -- the Kate who drinks and blacks out and has fun.  Well...here she is.
Baby, I didn't mean that. I was just being a jerk.
Fuck yeah you were. And what? Now you won't drink with me?
I don't know. Having a beer or something is one thing, but...I think you really may have a problem.
Well thanks for all the support when I was trying to be sober!
I'm sorry. I didn't realize --
Of course you didn't realize! You don't fucking care about me.
What are you talking about?! Of course I care about you. I love you.
I love you too. Love is the easy part. It's the rest of the shit that's hard.
Take off your pants.
Look -- I think you should get to sleep. You're really wasted.
I don't wanna sleep. I wanna fuck.
Please, will you stop?
No! I want you to fuck me!
Really. This is weird.
Be a man and fuck your wife!
No! Jesus -- what the fuck is wrong with you?
With me? With me?! What the fuck is wrong with me? I try hard and I get shit on! Fucked up family, fired from my job -- this marriage. Nothing's wrong with me! What's wrong with YOU?!
Kate, you need to --
What? What? What do I need? I can't drink because I'm crazy or something and I can't stay sober because of you!
You're blaming other people for your problems.
Stop it! You're acting like a freak!
No! What's wrong with you?
I can't be sober and be with you.
How's it coming?
You tell me.
* Delicious.                                                *
 Thanks.
At this meeting we give cakes to celebrate sober birthdays. We have one birthday tonight -- for Kate, for one year.  Jenny and Dave are giving her the                         * cake.
Hey, I'm Kate, alcoholic.
Hi, Kate.
I've heard that your best day drinking is worse than your worst day sober.  Well...that is SO not true! I had amazing times drinking, dancing, and laughing...feeling like the most adorable, charming girl in the world. And I was adorable.  I'd piss my pants, but I was still cute.
When I first tried getting sober, I figured that as long as I didn't drink...everything else would just magically work out. But it didn't.  My marriage fell apart. I got fired from my job. And that shit happened SOBER! I never read that in any pamphlet...  ...that isn't what I signed up for.  Um...so, I relapsed. Another shitty slogan I've heard in the rooms is that when you're sober for a bit and drink again "the disease waits for you, picks up where it left off."  I'm sorry you guys, but I HATE those slogans. They all sound like bumper stickers. But, I have to admit...for me, that last one is pretty damn true.  When I drink...I become another person. And that person is a pretty big asshole. Well, unless you want to give me drugs or buy me drinks -- then that person is awesome.
I wasn't happy being the "good-time girl," though. And honestly, I wasn't very good at it. 
 My life is really different than it was a year ago. I live alone. I'm bored a lot more. I have a job that pays a lot less.  I'm thankful for the program -- for my friends in here who took the time to help me and give a shit about me.
There are people that used to be a part of my life that I miss -- a lot -- but...  ...I'm really grateful for this boring new life of mine.
I was in North Carolina for a while                     * -- Durham -- playing minor league ball. I had some real heat. That's when I met Crash, here.  He'd been sent down to single-A to teach me how to carry myself as a pro ball-player. We got involved with the same woman -- an older chick -- but Crash won her in the end.  He's really taught me some...important life-lessons.
Wow...that's a pretty crazy way to meet.
Yeah. It is.
You guys are sorta like that movie...what's it called?
 I don't know. Which one?  Do you know what movie she means?
"Bull"...something? What is it?
Whatever. It'll come to me.  So...what do you do now, Crash?
I write about music.
Really?
Yeah...I do freelance for a lot of magazines. But print really is dead. So now most of my stuff winds up on websites. Which is depressing. `Cause you can't hold it -- you can just look at it. It's like...
Like what?
Huh?
You were talking about writing for websites and you kinda trailed off, honey.
 So, Crash -- why don't you tell this nice lady about the 21 days you were up in "The Show," and what the crowds were like, and --
It was crazy. I...
 I'm sorry -- I'm sure you're a great lady. You have lovely hands and hair but...
...I'm gonna go to the...I'm just gonna go.
 You want a ride...?
 Um...is he cool to drive?
Yeah, he'll be fine -- on his bicycle.
He rides a bicycle?
Oh, yeah --  -- as a teenager, he was a bike racing champion growing up in Bloomington, Indiana. He and his friends were called the "Cutters" -- and they beat a bunch of rich college kids in this big race. It was great. 
 Back then, I was a kickboxing instructor...
 So, I got into a little trouble -- drunk in public. On a bicycle.  Um, I was thinking...maybe I need to go to one of those meetings. I'd like to go with you, though. If that's cool.  Let me know if we could discuss it sometime, okay? Maybe you could come over to our -- um, my house?  Uh...yeah. Thanks.
 "Let me know if we could discuss it sometime?"  Such an idiot...
Miss our house?
Um...yeah. Sometimes.
 Miss me?
Sometimes.  I've been sober for a year.
Really?
Yeah.
They gave you that?
Yeah. A couple of days ago. Tuesday.
Oh...wow. Congratulations. That's really...really...just great. I mean it.  Tuesday is the night I got pulled over.  Parallel lives, huh?
So -- you dating anyone?
 Charlie...
Are you?
No.
Me either. Owen keeps trying to get me to be his "wing-man" and it's ridiculous and these girls in bars are so lame and I just keep thinking how I wish I was meeting you in a bar for the first time and I didn't come with any baggage and I could buy you a drink and flirt with you all night and ask for your number.  Wanna go out sometime?
I don't think it's a good idea.
I fucked up, didn't I?
Yeah, I did. I know I did. I had a beautiful woman who used to love me and now when I see her she doesn't even want to look me in the eyes.
Charlie, please don't do this.
I miss you. I miss the way you taste and smell and...I miss things about you that used to drive me nuts! I miss you liking shitty 80's music and fake punk-rock from the 90's...
I don't like shitty 80's music.  I like good 80's music.
...and all I want to do is touch you one more time to just, remember -- to make sure it was real.
 Or...maybe I'm a just a delusional fucking idiot.
You look really thin.
Yeah?
When did you last eat?
I dunno -- like...I'm not sure. (seems slightly concerned                           * that he can't remember) I think, um...
Should we order something?
Sure, yeah -- or I could make a bacon and egg sandwich...
I don't know. I haven't really been doing the meat thing.
Jesus. It starts with alcohol. Then meat.  Have you given up fun, too?
 Sorry. Bad joke.
Fine. Bacon and egg sandwiches. But I'm gonna make them.
Okay...
Sorry.
I don't care if you drink a beer.
You sure?
Yeah. Whatever.
 No...I'm good.
Have you been playing a lot?
I haven't played in over a year.
Then how're you beating me?
I don't know. Innate talent?
I haven't met anyone even vaguely interesting since we separated.
Um...stick to the game, okay?
I've been masturbating like crazy.
Charlie --
I miss you.
Stop it.
Okay. Fine.
You could've been killed.
 What?
Riding your bike -- drunk.
But I wasn't.
But is that really the point?
What are trying to say?
 I worry about you.
 Yeah, I can understand that. I used to worry about you. But now I know you're okay.  That makes me happy...I mean, it fucking sucks that you're better off without me but I'm glad you're doing well.
Would you move back in if I came to meetings?
You should go for yourself, not to make me happy.
But, would you?
I'm not moving back in.
Listen, I should go. It's gonna get dark soon.
We can always turn the lights on.
I don't know...
So, would you at least...let me take you out on a date?
Maybe...?
Okay...fine. 0 for 2.  Last question: can we just...play one more game?
C'mon...you keep kicking my ass. It's embarrassing. You've gotta give me a chance to redeem myself.  Please.
