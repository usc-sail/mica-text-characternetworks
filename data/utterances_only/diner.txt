Hot nuts, hot nuts, get from the peanut man.
What's up, Fen?
Just breaking windows, Boog
What for?
C' mon, don't be a sWuck.
I know that glass is made from sand, but how come you can see through it?
Leave the windows alone. What's the matter with you?
It's a smile, that's all.
I'm cracking up.
Gave her away.
What?
Gave her away. David Glazer said she was death.. So, I said if you like the way she looks, take her.
What are you, the Salvation Any?
Charged him five bucks.
C'mcn, upstairs. (as Ferwick just stares at him) C'mon . They walk away
Me? What about her? She didn't have to go. I'm nuts. Get that.
That's what you get from dating eleventh graders. Brains aren't developed.
Falsies. --.-
First hand info .
Shit, then what as .1 pissed about? They disappear up the, steps.
Where's Elyse?
Talking with your wife about the fucking wedding plans.
Gettin' cold feet?
They've never been warn. Boogie is talking with DLANE, the young eleventh grader that Fenwick had the falling out with. She is an attractive petite girl with large breasts.
How can you take Glazer over the Fen?
'Cause. r4' BOOGIE Diane, did you know that Glazer bought you for five bucks? That's the kinda guy he is.
He did?
Do you want to leave with Glazer?
Not really, but Fe^.wzck scares me. Why don't you take- me home?
Diane, I'm in law school at night, I have to go home and study. I just stopped by here, 'cause I appreciate fine music.
I thought you worked in a beauty parlor.
I do during the day. - (he puts his hand up and strokes her
Diane, go with Fen. For me, okay?
7R3 speeds by. Diane is in the car. Fenwick is telling her scnething and she laughs Boogie and MODE; t, follow. Behind them, Shrevie and his wife BETh follow in a 1950 Hudson Hornet. Fenwick floors his car and disappears around a bend. The other cars do not keep pace'.
Elyse feels that Eddie is getting very sensitive about the wedding.
I k:_ow. We were talking about it.
The closest of the close. You t-_.ow Billy's flying in this morning?
I didn't hear about it. Thought he was just coming in for the wedding day.
We didn't want to mention it. Surprise for Eddie. Shrevie's car follows in the taillights of Boogie's car. Fenwick's car is nowhere in sight.
Elyse's mother is very upset with Eddie. They picked out a yellow and white motif for the wedding. You know, like we did, tablecloth, napkins, maids-,of-honor. Anyway, Eddie objected. He wanted blue and white because that's The Colts' colors. Refused to give in.
Yeah, so?
Well, you know how stubborn Eddie is .
Could be worse. It could be black and gold. Steelers' colors. Shrevie notices Boogie's taillights come or.. He slows down. Something is wrong up ahead. f EXT. ?.CADSIDE - NIGHT Fenwick's car is turned over. The headlights of the car shine brightly against a tree.
--_S.t's. ficult to see exactly what has happeried.Jn the darkness of the road. Boogie, Modell, Shrevie and Beta exit the cars and walk toward the accident. As they approach we see Fe_zwick lying halfway out of the car covered in blood. Diane cannot be seen.
(-,?eac ting to the sight of Fenwick's
Oh Jesus. Boogie kaeels nest to Fenwick. -After a beat,. Fenwick explodes with laughter.
You son-cf-a-bitch ! Fenwick screams in laughter.
I really got you guys, didn't I? Didn't I? Been carrying a ketchup bottle around for weeks. Diane steps out of the woods. She laughs nervously.
11 I hid in the woods. Didn't want any ketchup on me. Fc: W ICK Weeks, just lookin' for the right ti=e.
You got me. Christ, I thought you bought it.
Real hard holding back the laughs. Real hard.
You outdid yourself.
That's very matt,-re, Fenwick.
Fuck mature.
Sorry, Beth.
Tug--ied the car over yourself? FEi1Gi I CIK Yeah, give me a hand.
No way.
C'man.
 Fenwick, you to ed that car over. You must put it upright yourself. You need some discipline in your life. F.:- i " + 4 1 CK C'mon, guys. It was easy pushing it over 'cause of the angle. 1:'11 be a bitch getting it up.
Boogie and Modell get in the car. Shrevie and his wife ge c 111--the?uason- - - - -
Have you tried? You haven't tried.
.Sbmuck, _another five seconds an3 you'd have us for free. They laugh. Shravie starts his car.
You guys t eal ly are sick, you n k ow that.?
That's 'cause you got no sense of humor. He pulls away. Sr.REVIE
out the window) See you guys later at the dine=.
Exi . -DINER - NIGHT The diner is one of the typical late S0's metal and glass structures. Almost deco in design. Cars are parked in front, including Shrevie's Hudson Hornet. CAXR4 PANS to a car parked over in a corner. TABACX has his truck open, filled with pants. A few guys are going through the goods as Taback tries to wheel-and- deal.
 Seven bucks. All wool. You can't beat it. h T e GUY holds it up.
The crotch looks too short. Don't ca--e for that.
What are you afraid it's gonna got caught In the crack between your legs?. The other guys "Whoco" in reaction to Taback's put-down.
You sure are hot shi . since you've taken over your father's business here. He throws the pants back and walks away,
INi . DINER - NIGHT The diner is the late-night hangout... made up of a mixed bag crowd. Around one side, the aluinun siding SALE'S?. N guys in their 30s and 40s. Some HIGH SCHOOL ERS , only there on the waekends, and the, Boogie-S?irevie c_cwd. (The guys in their early t,?enties .) One thing is quite apparent. There are no girls present, except WAIT=S.SSES. T h at is the unspoken rule. NO DATES. Eddie, Shrevie and Modell sit in a booth. They all eat french fries and gravy.
You can't compare Mathis to Sinatra. No way.
They're both great singers.
Yeah, but you can't compare them. Sinatra is the lord. He's big in movies, everything.
That's true. There's hardly any blues in movies. Just sidekicks.
C'mon, they could've put Mathis in 'From Here to Eternity.' They had blues in the war.
Mathis didn't come around until after that movie.
Are you telling me Mathis could've played Maggio? Is that what I'm hearing?
Who do you make-out to? Sinatra or Mathis?
For that, Mathis.
I'm married. We don't Wake-cut. They laugh. - Fern wick enters and heads toward the guys' booth.- passes the -Waitress .
How'd it go? FEiWWI C:K Pretty good. Said she never wanted to see me again.
charmed her, huh?
AI-I-did was -park the --car on a nice lonely road. I Looked at her and said, 'Fuck or fight.' The guys laugh.
You maniac. FE:l I cK Kidding. Said she wanted to see me again. Liked aye, sort of.
Emis? Fenwick nods. He sticks out his pinky. Eddie gabs it with his pinky. Therefore it's the truth.
The guy's canvassing the neighborhood, and I notice he's stopping at the brick houses. He's trying to sell aluminun siding to the brick house owners.
Don't remember.
?'oa,. nobody bets two thousand and forgets.
Okay, so? What's the point, Bagel?
Where you getting C40 thousand? You haven't got a pot to piss in.
Game's a lock.
Nothing's a lock. You want me to call it off? As a favor to your father, may he rest in peace.
Bagel, get in. Trust me. Boogie Walks off. - -
Kids today. Nobody's interested in making an honest buck.
Heard he wants to be a lawyer.
That's what I'm saying. You call that an honest buck? Boogie approaches the guys and sits do
Bagel heard about my basketball bet.
I'm down for fifty.
Woo, biz spender. I'm telling you. They're shaving points on the game. This is no bullshit tip. Get in, guys.
I'll think about it. Listen, who do you pick? Sinatra or Mathis?
Presley.
Presley. You're _ick.
Did I tell you guys I'm taking out Carol Heatrow tomorrow night?
You're taking out Carol Heatrow?
She is death.
Only go for the best.
Cold.
What's the bet she goes for my pecker on the first date?
The only hand on your schiong is gonna be yours.
Bet me t-wen t-r .
You got it.
I'm in.
Me, too.
I'm in, but we need validation.
All right. I'll arrange it.
--A .our -engine- prop -comes into-vi view asTt rates its approach. The plane sails inches off the runway and then touches down.
to include Shrevie's Hudson Hornet, as it backs up, moving toward Billy. As it approaches, the back door opens .
(thr awing his
You g' ys ara too much. Hcw' d you know I was ccain' in this mcFn._nc?
C'mcn, get in. Billy climbs in and slams the door shut. The Hudson pulls away.
He's crazy is t-,hat he is. With the Shrevie here it was just nuts, but Eddie? T?:at's lunacy.
Mari age is a? right. I'm not complaining.
Not complaining. Uz u, sounds good.
What? He's getting mar_ied on New Year's Eve.
Not until she takes the test.
Boog, what are you talking about?
Are you shitting me?
You know Eddie and the Colts. Very serious. The test has something like a hundred and forty questions. True and false, multiple choice, short answer.
Oral cast. He doesn't want any cheati:,g.
What happens if she fails? He's going to call. it off? Is that what I hear?
rte swears to 1.tThe was supposed to be two months ago. Elyse keeps delaying. Heavy pressure.
Her plan could be, though, to stall until the last minute. Then if she falls, it doesn't matter. It's a fait accompli. Kno.t's tied.
Fait accompli, my ass. He walks.
I doubt it. I tell you, it was a real surprise. No call. Just a note. Why do you figure, all of a sudden?
Botton line? Elyse turns into -- - Iceland and Eddie's not the type to look elcev.here. Eddie goes for the marriage, and Elyse is back to being the Bahamas again.
You dgn' t know that for sure, Boog.
I'm a good judge of human nature.
The Hudson is parked out front. The morning light is just beginning to break. THROUGH iZ WINDOW we can see the - guys sitting in a booth eating. They are obviously having a good time. Shrevie takes a sip of coffee. Billy says something and Shrevie puts his hand to his mouth. Coffee pours through his fingers and down his chin.
-And hat' -was-nothing -compared to what happened in Miss Nathan's class.
This is great. I was there.
Had her for Art class. Third floor. She catches mq talking. Tells me to see her after class. I jumped up from my seat and started screaming 'I can't take it - any morei You're always picking on met I can't stand itt' Then, I ran to the window, opened it and jumped out. She freaks and faints dead away. She forgot the gym roof was six feet below.
----Her eyes closed. -- She swayed for - - a moment and then toppled right over her high heels. Out cold. I was hysterical.
The topper was the Principal. Donley comes in and sees Miss Nathan on the floor. He doesn't I .ow what to make of it.
Than She=an, remember him? Normally a shruck, but ne stands up and says 'Snhrhhh, she's sleeping, Mr. Donley.' T h an he sees Billy in the window.
I said, 'I'm sorry I'm late, sir, but my bus broke dour.. Is Miss Nathan up yet?' All the guys laugh.
You're missing the action now, Billy. Half the guys are a: U. of B. night school. A Lot of fucking laughs. 
- : Cto?BiiIy) - A Masters in Business. That's the lowest. Billy shrugs his shoulders as if to say, "What. can I - tell you?"
Who's there?
Eddie, of course. Burton.
Burton?
Dropped out of rabbinicalschool. Henry...
-Cliff, -.the Mouse..-.- -
Youssei.
Thrown out.
Yeah?
Accidentally stole some money from one of the teachers.
U. of B.'s busy at night, huh?
And then there's me.
Yeah? You at law school?
Thought I'd take a pop with the law. Although I'm still working the beauty salon.
See you guys at the diner tonight. i He slats the door shut. The car pulls away. Billy walks up the steps, pulls out a key and opens the .door.
Seconds later the door opens. t.S. SI:2ONS, a short, heavyset woman, stands there.
Yeah, thought I'd spend the holidays here. Lot of parties, I hear. He enters.
No.
He still. sleeping?
Whaddya say, Bill?
Still the early riser, huh? Eddie reaches over to the night table and lights a Pall Mall.
Nothin' changes.
Except you getting married.
Yeah, ain't that a kick. Ae gets out of bed, picks -up a--pair of pants off the floor and steps into them.
Nothing's happening arc=-d. c==us , so... Eddie puts a shirt on and slips'a tie with an aebeady make scot around his neck. He pulls t:e tie ud , then starts buttoning the rest of the shirt.
You bring in that girl with you?
Broke up.
Shame. In that picture you sent, looked like she had great knockers.
Yea?-i. I Didn't figure on you and Elyse so soon.
Eddie searches the floor and picks out two socks that are sLi= i ar, ut rot the same. -
I figured New Year's Eve would be good. Get married. Party through the night. You know. He puts the socks on. They have holes in the heels.
I was pissed off, Ed, figured you would call, or something. Let me know you were planning it.
Yeah, I know. But you're my best man. He walks into the bathra.,m. CA2--ERA FOLLOWS. He splashes some water on his face and wipas it with a wash rag.
(with a mouthful
Yeah? I left the diner at five. They didn't say anything to me.
Surr .se, I guess.
How'd they know?
Barbara Keller told Fenwick.
You keep in touch, huh?
Yeah.
You re tiIl n3ili g her, a= en t you, you son-of-a-bitch. Eddie spits the toothpaste out and sticks his ncuth under the faucet to rinse, .aking sure to keep his tie dry.
Never did. Eddie wipes his mouth with his hand.
Who you kidding? He puts the cigarette back in his mouth and starts out of the room. Billy follows.
Talking.
as they start down the stairs.
Talking? Shit, if you want to talk there's always the guys at the diner. Yov don' L -need a girl if you want to talk.
Eddie, you'll never change.
Da=. right.
Mrs. Si=cns is cleaning the refrigerator as Eddie and Billy enter.
EMPTY_LINE
I'm hungry here.
You want something to eat? Make it. I haven't got all day to wait on you.
Come on, Ma. Don't give me that shit. -A fried baloney sandwich will be good. M.rs. Si=ons t:..Ts around angrily.
A fried baloney sandwich is not a lot to ask for, for Christsake! Mrs. Sion picks up a butcher knifa off the sink cct:rte; and waves it at Eddie.`-
You want to stab me? Come on l Come on! He brings his fist up and ass,,=es a bossing position. Mrs. Simmons moves toward Eddie welding the knife. Eddie backs around the table. Billy watches this scene without ex- 1f pression.
Take your best shot. Then I'm going to p=.,ch your lights cut, Ma.
Who do you think you area
Lome on! Come on2 Go for the cut, then you're down and out. The short, heavyset woman continues to stalk Eddie as they move around the table. Billy is not disturbed or surprised, T h is is apparently an ongoing occurrence,
I'-ie gat fists of granite. You're going down. S i=ons turns away.
I'm not going to ruin a good knife on you. It's not worth it. ..cdie t.T-:s to Billy and smiles .
No thanks.
No, really.
Is this show in 'color or is there something wrong with the set?
This is a black and white set, but I don't think . that - show is in color, anyway.
I don't like color television. Don't like. that color for no thin' . Saw 'Bonanza' at my in-laws, it's not fog me. The Ponderosa looked fake. Hardly recognized Little Joe.
It might have needed some tuning.
It's not for me. You got an Emerson? Hear they're real good. Screvie and theCustcmer move down the aisle Ferriick enters the store. He looks like he is slightly drink.
Here's an Emerson. This is portable.
You got that 21-inch Emerscr.. 711-4 e cabinet type.
The console model.
Kenny! We get some of the Emerson consoles in?!
Let me check out in the warehouse!
Be right back. That'll take a minute or two for him to check. The Customer nods and Shrevie walks up to Fenwick.
I talked to Boog. He's going to take Carol to the Crest tonight.
So what do you want to do?
I figure I'll be there. Sit a few seats away.
--- Think 3 ` Ll -be -there -too : - - Don'-t----- want any judgecent calls. r r _.WICK Bong's got about'a hundred dollars riding on this thing now. Making bets left and right.
Jesus, hundred bucks, already? F EMNi CK Lot of paople bectin' for. Carol. Sh_evie senses that Fenwick is a little off.
What the hell you been doing? You been drinking- already?
Yeah? I guess so.
What for? It's coo early.
Heturns_and sta?rr__s tv_head out of th 4Qrc F L' aIY l CK
Fen, sure you're okay? Fenwick turns back and smiles at Shrevie.
Hey... yeah. He turns back and exits.
Colt Char,.picns`:ip is tomcr- ow. Want =,e to get you a ticket for the game?
T Can you get one this late?
Yeah. You can't be in Bala'-ore and not see the Colts win the Championship. It would be sacrilegious. They enter the pool hall.
Billy and Eddie come down the steps into the pcol room. The place is old and dirty looking. Candy wrappers and cigarettes litter the floor. KNOCKO, a gray-haired man in his 60's, sits behind the cash register reading she Wall Street Journal. On the back wall there are pictures of the semi-nude girls from the men's magazines of the period. Some are autographed to Knocko.
As the guys approach, Knocko looks up and smiles.
Billy, Billy, Billy.
Row you doing, Knccko?
Eat, sleep, you know. Never see you and the guys anymore.
You know how it is. Time to move i W n, I guess.
Eddie's the only one who still pops in. Still loves the game.  You doing okay, Billy.
Wonderful. All your crowd turned out fine. Take seven. It's got a new felt.
Eight's better.
Take eight. The pool maven here. They walk toward the tables. The place is quiet. After- noons are not the action time.
After a beat, Eddie's head. comes INTO FRAM behind the ball. He closes one eye aQ he '.fines up a shot.
I'm scared shitless, to tell you the truth.
You know anybody who's Mot?
If I had a choice, I'd just date Elyse all my Life. Just date her and the hell with the rest. I like dating.
as Eddie backs off the shot and starts to Bove around the table. Billy sips an or3rige soda.
What are you doing it for? Eddie approaches Billy; reaches for the bottle and takes a sip.
1tat -am 4-doing_i..t -ford--I've been dating Elyse for five years. What am I... I have no choice.. It gets to a point where a girl says, 'Hey, where am I going?' He hands the bottle back and chalks his pool cue.
Sudde^I Methaa wa??ks away.
He memcrized the whole movie? Eddie lines up another shot.
h T e younger guys, I tell ya, are crazier than we were. He shoots and misses. From another table a GUY yells out.
Eddie, you taking any of Boogie's action?
Yeah! No way he pulls this off.
Shrevie stands in the lobby with his wife, Beth, an attrac- tive girl. Eddie and Fenwick enter and walk over to Shrevie.
for bringing Beth) Beth heard the movie was pretty good.
Eddie, where's Elyse?
She's hcme studying for the football test. 
You're kidding.
See- the Bcog yet?
Not yet. FART. MAGET, an enormously fat guy, enters with a FRIE.TD. The Friend stops at the candy counter.

(staring for a
I think so.
In surprised she's with h--m. - fro= what I've heard about her, Boogie wouldn't seen her type. Eddie is as;azed at hcw beau, ciu1 Carol looks.
She is death. Death. Fenwick spots the GRIPPER walking toward the Men's Rcon. The Gripper stands about 6'4" and is all muscle.
Davit The Gripper's :era.
Where? Fenwick nods toward the Yen's Room.
Hope he doesn't see me. Every time he sees me, he puts the grip on me.
Saw him put a grip on a guy at the diner. Gripped him right through his corduroy jacket. Made him stand on tip-toes.- S'r'_P'.EVIE Where's Billy?'
Cowin' with that Barbara Keller chick, I think. Bccgie gets a large box of popcorn and a Coke and starts into the theater with Carol. Just before he enters he gives a smile to the guys.
Guess I might as well get a seac.
Let's sit in the back. BE'1"s.-I Why?
Carol's hand dips into the popcorn box on Boogie's lap and takes out a handful of popcorn. Shrevie, seated in the back, is restless, wondering what iz happening. Beth is mesr-arized by Troy Donahua. Billy sits on an aisle, =aware of the quiet intrigue that is . taking place. - ?.. Carol's hand again reaches into the box and takes out a few kernels. Boogie's eyes glance toward Fenwick. Fenwick shakes his. head and mouths "Bet's off. Not fair." Boogie nods "Yes. Troy and Sandra walk the beach. The romantic score swells. The yotzia- audience is caught up in this screen love affair. Carol reaches into the- popcorn box once again. Suddenly she screaws. She bolts up from her seat and races up the aisle. The audience iq alive with chatter, war, wondering what has happened. Boogie turns to Fenwick and smiles. Then he heads ue the aisle after Carol.
(as she watches Boogie racing up the aisle after
What's going on?
Hold on, hold on a second.
You'are disgusting!
I know it was terrible, really horrible and all, but it was an accident.
An accident! She starts into the Ladies' Room. Boogie holds her arm.
Wait! Carol! Woo! Seriously, it was an accident. Swear to God.- -
An accident. Your th?.ng just got into a box of popcorn?
Damn near that. Can I be straight with you? Carol tries to settle dc--n.
Boogie'...
There's a good reason, but it's a little embarrassing to me. So maybe you don't want to hear it. I'll understand. A long beat.
Co on. Let me hear this.
I don't like to tell this to girls, but you really are a C knockout, really.
L.j BOOGIE ? h;-, use sitt`rg rtex? toy u in there got me crazy. I got a hard on.. I don't like to admit it, but I did. You don't know me, but I always try to come off being cool. Don't like to look like I'm hustling, and there I am, sitting next to you with a boner. Am I embarrassing you?
Well, it was killing me. So ..o stop tho pain, it was digging into my pants and all, I opened -----m7 fly. - Lmosen everything up. Give it a little air, you know. And it worked. Everything settled down and I got caught up in the picture. Forgot all about it. Then when I saw Sandra wearing the bathing suit in that cove scene, you know, it just popped right out and went right through the bottom of the popcorn box. The force of it opened the flap. Carol stares at him, wondering if ? s is telling th= Lrut`:. The beautiful "Su_.^ -per Place Love Theme" GROWS LCCSER for a few seconds ar som=one comes through the doors and heads for the candy counter.
It just pushed the flap open?
It's Ripley's, I tell ya. An d I couldn't move the box or you would have seen it.
That's true.
 Come, on, let's go back inside. As they go through the doors we hear Troy say:
I want. to kiss you here in front of God and evcryone.
Troy Donahue.
What kind of a name is Troy?
He's gorgeous.
 Troy. Fenwick and Eddie approach.
Cute.
Booszie and Carol exit the theater.

Outstanding! See you guys later. Come on, Beth.
Are we going to eat?
Nah, not-in the mood. Shrevie heads toward his Hudson. Be_h fol.Lows.
It was the 11th... no 10th grade. Billy was playing ball against one of the high school fraternities. I think they were ULP. Billy came sliding into second base-to break up a double play. - The second baseman s Billy, thinking he was out to hurt"hJm Billy punches the guy and the whole ULP team -j=-?.d him. r Beat the shit out of him. They approach the Hudson. Shrevie goes around to the driver's side and opens the door and ge:S inside. He then opens the door for Beth to get in.
He's been after them all these years? That was forever ago.

I tried to call.
Switchboard closes down at ten.
I was just getting the feeling you were avoiding me, Barb.
That's -.lot true, Willy. They enter the control room. The control room overlooks the studio floor. Technicians are setting up the cameras, microphones, lights. -over- the control room a bank of monitors hang down from a metal shelf. The TEC:=`iICAI. DI? CTOR is talking over a headset, balancing video levels. Barbara slips cis a headset and shuffles through some papers.
infor=a_ion) Governor's press conference is on Three? There's a B roil to that. Four? Okay. Goodwill Charity Christmas Party? Three also? And :h-s slides? One? Barbara looks up at the clock. It reads: 10:58. h T e Director rushes into the booth with the news script. He quickly sits and puts on his headset.
- Ten seconds. Billy steps forward to get a better view of the activity on the floor. The Director becomes aware of his presence.
Who's the visitor?
Friend of mine. Five seconds.
And one, mike, cues
President Eisenhower returns from Wrld Peace Trur. Steel dispute continues . " These and other stories next.
Roll three. Three and track. A cor ercial cones up on the air mot i car .
Willy, after this I still have a lot of work to do. Why don't you call in the morning?
Where's the news opening?
On six.
What's good?
Punch I.D. and announce. A slide of the television station's call letters comes uo. The Alti'NOUNCZR in a glass booth off to the right speaks:
This is Wi?'4R TV 2 in Baltimore, wishing all our viewers a Merry G<_ Christrias and a Happy New Year.
Two days till the test. If she passes, t7.ro more days to the thing tae marriage.
Where you going? Puerto Rico?

Shrevie, you happy with your d rtar- _a ge , or what?
To be honest, I dcn't kncw. You kncw. . How can you not know? It's not like you're trying to figure out the difference between Pepsi. Cola and Rcyal Crown, for Chris' s.tke . S FR-t viE Beth is te -ific and everything, but I don't know. Eddie locks off, not happy with the answer.
Well, that's okay. We've got the diner.
The house is a pleasant two -s tcry wccd s t=cc r_,d e . A yellcw porch light is on. Bocgie and Carol walk ut the steps to the front door. Carol opens the door with the key. She back toward Boogie.
Do you want to come inside?
-Are your. parent:. around?

Not Stay away! I'm not going to get gipped! You're not going to get me to walk on my tiptoes in pain. Oh, no.

We gave little Joel Cher--I a nickel -apiece to find cut is they were real. Told him to be slnbcle. He walked over, reached uc and grabbed. T::rned to us and yelled, 'They're real!'
The whole thing with girls is painfu?. And it keeps getting acre painful... instead of easier. Billy downs his beer and orders tT,o more.
Remember 'copping a feel'? Boogie was the first. Said it was great. So, when I tcck out Ruth Ray I figured I had to do it.
Ruth Ray, eighth grade.
Right. Sat on the couch in her club cellar for hours, trying to figure out a way to get my arm arc:,tzid her. Finally, I learned the 'move.' I yawned and put my arm around her shoulder. He demonstrates on Eddie.-
Bong, you should get outta here. Tank's Inside. Boogie gets out of the car and slams the door shut. He looks coward the diner and thinks a moment.
He'll just keep looking for me. He starts toward the diner.
Boag..
Tank. --
Lucky can.
That so.
Yeah. The Bagel just raid off your debt. Boogie looks at him, trying to size up the situation. Wcnderirg if he's r=ning a nurbey for scale reason.
T'hat's the story. Tank starts past Boogie.
Tank tu :s. Boogie slams his fist into his stcWach. Tank drops to one knee in pain.
Thanks, Bagel.
Your mother called. She was frantic. So, out of respect for your -f at:.er. - - - He sips his coffee. Then h,.i picks up a toasted bagel and butters it.
Probably right.
Ccee to work for me. There's a lot of money to be made in the home improvement business. You'd be very good at it. Boogie thinks about it. Bagel chews on his bagel.
Well, I was only really using law as a come=on for the girls. They like that. But, what the hell.
Call the two thousand an advance.
I'll work for you... for awhile. Then, I'll have to move on to bigger things.
Always a dreamer, eh, Boog?
If you don't have good dreams, Bagel, you've got nightmares. He flashes him a smile.
tNT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT Billy and' Eddie are still dri^king at the bar. They are not drunk, just ve-cy happy.
I'll tell you one chinz that happens when you get mcrried. You have to give up your old friends. Billy listens to the music, slapping his thighs, crying be get the band to pick up the beat.
It won't change, only if we let it. Billy keeps ,slapping his thighs, but the dr.:mmer and the saxophonist continue on, unaware of Billy's private urgings.

Since then your hu o has moved up to the sixth grade, is that it? Eddie laughs. He enjoys the put-down.
You're all right.
You guys have made my night. You should come dewy, and hang out more often.
Don't think I can. Getting ma--- ' ed. Billy looks- at him. - Eddie smiles. 
Figured she would have gotten the Alan Aaeche question that Shrevie screwed up.
Benefit of the doubt.
Exactly.
I love weddings. Just never found the time to settle... or wanted to.
No marriage.
Got a girl?
Not really. Just in love.
Does the girl know?
Yeah, I told her about it.
Told her? Did you show her? Billy thinks about that as they enter an all-ciaht cootee shop.
Nice morning.
Yes, it is.
Mornings I've always felt are a good time to ride. - Ann doesn't- respond. -
Not around here. Here. Boogie looks around what seems like endless ccun yside. He's over,whelmed.
-- '---I was wait ng for an invite. Ann studies him.
Let's ride. She kicks her horse and gallops off. Boogie follows As they ride AWAY FROM CAMERA.
The guests sit in fold;.ng chairs eagerly waiting for, the wedding procession to begin. The MUSIC BEGINS. However, it is not the traditional wedding math but rather the Baltimore Colts'Fight Song. Even though the organist has softened it, there is still _a _"rah-rah" quality to it. The flower girl comes down the--- aisle throwing white flowers on the blue aisle. Modell with his GIRLFRIEND.
What is that music?
Colt Marching Song. Sounds good, huh? The ushers come for4ar3. Boogie and Fenwick, followed by Shrevie, who walks alone. They are all smartly dressed in black tuxedos. The bridesmaids come forward. Beth and another girl. Fol- lowed by tao more girls. Followed by two more girls. Billy and Eddie start down- the aisle. Behind them is Eddie's Mother and Father. They walk on either side of his grandmother. The COLT ING SONG CONTINUES ON. Eddie sees someone sitting one seat in from the aisle. He whispers to Billy.
Moon Shaw? Where?

The six-piece band plays a nice, perky, dance t ne. Some women dance with women. Mothers dance with sons, fathers and daughters and some husbands with wives. Shrevie dances with Beth and they seem to be enjoying themselves. C.?NaRA PANS TO Fenwick and the eleventh grader, Diane.
Why not travel the United States? Fr`IW CK It's been done. Europe. Europe looks like a smile. Cr=1 'RA PA NS TO Boogie and Ann C'._sho'.m. He is staetieg Co walk coward the buffet table.

That was nice of him.
So, I'll work and care for the child. It can be done. I'll just have to put up with those who want to think badly of me.
That's not going to be easy.
I know
You know what I realized just yesterday? I've been intimidated by you. I always liked you because you were strong, independent, and all. But I've been intimidated by that as well. I've always held -.back with you.- When we kissed, I held back. The same when we made Luve in New York. I keep thinking I have to be special, like normal passion wasn't proper... as if it were just too ordinary and we were beyond that.
If that's the case, think that's a hard thing to
