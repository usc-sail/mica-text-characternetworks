Well...how do you feel?
Ask me in about five minutes.
I'm talking about graduation. Being totally free to do whatever we want now.
It feels excellent.
Gotta throw the anchor over.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
C'mon, Jimmy. Something's bothering you.
It's just that we're right around that old summer camp where all those murders took place.
What murders?
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
Tell me.
There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
What stories?
There was this boy named Jason Voorhees who drowned in Crystal Lake...
Hhhhelp....me....I'm drowning...
None of the counselors heard him.
Mmmmmmommy....
A bunch of years went by and everybody forgot about it.  That's when the murders started.
Jason did it...?
That's what some people thought. But they were wrong.
His mother blamed the counselors for his death and tried to kill them all.  She got her head chopped off by one of them.
So the murders stopped?
No.
Legend has it that Jason came back to avenge his mother's death, vowing to kill every teenager from the area.  And every now and then, the murders start up again.
Forget about it, Suzy. They're just stories.
We're the last graduating class, right?
Right.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
Right.
So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
Right. Except that Jason isn't real so none of it matters anyway.
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
C'mon, I'm serious.
All right, I'll check it out.
Jimmy...?
Jim...?
Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean it...
Gotcha good, baby cakes.
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
And you'll never do it again.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
No.
JJJJJJJJason...
Uh-huh. You must really think I'm an ass.
Ohmygod...
Remember girls, the shuffleboard tournament will start at six p.m. sharp. A non-attendance will restrict your time in port, understood?
You're telling me this boat has a pool with a three meter board?
It's a ship and that's right. Plus a disco, gym, game room and a lot more.
I think I'm gonna blow off New York and just stay on this thing.
You'll do no such thing, Mr. Wolfe...
Your itinerary has been carefully planned and make no mistake, it will be executed accordingly.
 Of course...wouldn't want to risk enjoying this trip.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
Rennie's not coming.
But I thought...
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
Sean -- where the hell have you been? We're already into early departure protocol...
Be right up, Dad.
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
What about not-so-great writers?
Just felt a little chill.
Really?
That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
I don't know what to say...
Are you ready for drugs, sex and rock 'n roll or what, girl?
Hello, Tamara.
Hi, Mrs. Watanabe. Just kidding.
Yes, I'm sure.
Don't worry about a thing, Mom. I'll have a terrific time and I won't do anything stupid, okay?
I love you...
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
Really?
I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
He bought you that?
More or less. It's part of my college fund.
You can stop right there, Miss Mason.
Only graduating seniors are allowed on this cruise.
What are you talking about?
You never turned in your final biology project, so I've had your diploma rescinded.
You can't do that...
It's already been done.  Congratulations on the 3.9 average, Miss Watanabe. You're in stateroom two- fifty-five.
Look, Mr. McCulloch, I got in a car accident yesterday and missed our appointment. It's okay, no big deal, just a bruised arm...  ...so I brought my project along today. It's in my suitcase. Really.
She's telling the truth, Mr. McCulloch. I saw her pack it.
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
Perfectly.
A major prick.
What are you going to do?
Improvise, of course.
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
You have no right...
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
Hhhhelp me...
Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...
I just got a little dizzy. I'm fine.
 Let's take in the brow.
Yes Sir.  Take in the gangway and single up all lines.
Hello, Dad.
Hey, Admiral Robertson. Love your ship.
She's a beauty, isn't she? I should've retired from the Navy ten years ago.
You've really been generous to give us this cruise. I know I speak for everybody on board.
Hell, there's just twenty or so of you -- we only need a skeleton crew and it's a pleasure to sail her anyway.  By the way, congratulations on winning the intramural diving championships, Miles. I'm sure you made your old man proud.
Have you decided on your departure protocol, Admiral?
Actually, I thought I'd leave the honors to my son.
Dad, I don't think...
 Relinquishing command of the Princess Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson.
But before you take the helm, take this.
Something old and something new. I used the sextant when I was your age, but now they have these goddamn computers to do all the work for you.
 Have you decided on a plan of departure, Captain?
How about if we start up the forward engines and come around. 180 degrees...
Aren't you forgetting something?
We're in foggy weather! Send out the international maritime signal that a vessel is backing down, followed by a security broadcast warning other ships!
This voyage is doomed.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Rennie...
Hi, Sean.
I heard you weren't coming.
 We changed our minds.
I got you a present.
But I didn't get you one...
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
Sean...it's beautiful.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
I'd love to.
Your father was looking for you, Mr. Robertson.
I guess I'll see you later.
There's a storm predicted tonight.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
I'm staying.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
She didn't push me into coming.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
I'm staying.
 Is this axe awesome or what?
Too cool, J.J. Your parents came through.
No lie. I hear there's a big power room down below where I can get supreme concert hall echo. Come down and shoot a basement tape on me, okay?
Sure...but I gotta shoot some shockumentary footage first.
Man, don't tell me you're still trying to scam on Tamara...
How long have we known each other? Don't be a dweeb, Wayne. She's not interested in you, only what you can do for her. She's a user.
She's sexy.
So's this guitar. So what?
I'll catch you later.
This place is aching for a video. Wayne, you're an asshole.
What do you think...time for some personal experiences to fuel our minds?
I agree.
Okay Toby, calm down...
I'm not sure we're supposed to be here, Tamara.
Is that a muscular bod or what?
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
 My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me.
Gorgeous guy at ten o'clock. Look sensual.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
You're joking, right?
Have you seen my niece anywhere?
Yeah, motivating downstairs, I think. What's the problem, Mr. McCulloch?
Senior predictions started five minutes ago and she hasn't shown up.
Some of us don't want our futures predicted.
In your case I'm sure that's true.
The night time is the right time.
 No thanks.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
 I guess not.
Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
Is that unbelievable or what?
Jesus, you scared the hell out of us.
Have you seen my dog? I think he came this way.
No, we haven't.  Care for a hit?
No thanks.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
Toby?
Oh yeah. Ready to party and then some.
What are you doing in here?
Nothing.
Are you girls using drugs?
Do you think I would use drugs, Mr. McCulloch? We were just exploring the ship.
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
They're out of town.
Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
What are you going to do?
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
A half-twist short. I'll hone that dive yet.
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
 Yeah...a lot.
 There's something I haven't told you...
Wow, sorry...
It was an accident, I swear...
What happened?  Rennie, are you okay?
That was truly excellent.
 Yeah.
Time to check out the waiters.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
But...wait a minute!
Some friend you are.
I can't swim.
It's not that simple.
 Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
Dear God...
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
It wasn't her fault.
Stay away from her...both of you.
He's come back and you're all going to die.
Just...leave me alone...
The door's open.
I'm in no mood for any more stall tactics, Miss Mason. Where is your final project?
Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne first, Charles?
Where did you get that alcohol?
I packed it. Just for us.
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
Take a closer look, Charles. I want to make sure I labeled all my organs correctly.
Oh, you've done it now. Not only are you going home, I'll see to it that you spend next year back in a high school classroom!
I don't think so, Mr. McCulloch.  Did you get anything good?
Oh yeah.
You'll never get away with it.  And you can forget about ever attending any film school.  You're both going to be very, very sorry.
Relax, Wayne. He won't risk doing a thing.  Can I have the tape?
This is going to sound supremely lame...but I've had the major hots for you since our sophomore year, Tamara.
That's sweet, Wayne. Look, I'd love to chat but I'm really pressed for time.  Let's try to get together later, okey- doke?
But I thought...
Thanks for the camerawork.
Wayne, you're an asshole.
It's not real, it's not real...
Please...please don't...
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Me too.  Let's go talk to my Dad.
Let's kick in the stablilizers, Mr. Carlson, and get the seas off the quarter. These kids are in for one hell of a storm.
Yes Sir. Activating comfort cruise mode.
How olds your boy now, Carlson?
Nineteen months.
A tremendous age. Take some advice from a salty old man: don't push him too hard.
This is the bridge. Approaching weather suggests we secure the main deck and...
Better have them doublecheck the lifeboat stations as well...
Can he really take us home?
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
What about you?
If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
Oh Jesus...Dad??
He's...he's dead...
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
 That's a very good question and I'd appreciate an answer.
Attention everybody, attention. This is Sean Robertson...
There's been...  What I mean is, this is an emergency...
Miles -- have you seen J.J.? She was supposed to be jamming down in the power room but...
Repeat, this is an emergency...
I want everybody to meet on the bridge...
What the fuck is this?
Stay calm, but get here as quick as possible. Walk with a friend if you can...
God, I wish this was a joke, but it's not.
What is happening???
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
What do you mean???
I don't know what I mean! All's I know is that there's no one guiding this ship anymore...
Can't you call for help??
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
Where are they?
The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them
I didn't mean for you to go!
Just radio for help, okay???
Mayday, mayday, mayday...
Please...can anybody out there hear me??
Sean, what's going on?
Jesus Christ...
Who did this, man?
Is the radio even working??
Isn't there some international S.O.S. thing you can do???
 Channel 16...the distress frequency...  Mayday, mayday, mayday...this is the Princess Ruby. Please, somebody answer...
This is Coast Guard cutter Dallas. What is the nature of your problem, Ruby?
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
 What is your location?
I...I don't know...
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
Yes...
The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
I've got the numbers.
Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
Hello? Are you there??
I demand to know what is going on...
Where's the radio?
It's...dead.
You're all going to die.
You're the last ones. He's come back for you.
What are you talking about?
Jason Voorhees.
You're insane, old man. Jason Voorhees has been dead for over thirty years.
He walks this ship, here and now.
A killer walks this ship indeed. And it's certainly none of us...
You're the one who's insane!!
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
Walking corpses are not real!
Yeah, well these dead bodies are sure enough real.  I say we regroup and find this motherfucker before he finds us.
You'll do no.such thing and watch your mouth, young man! I'm in charge here!
School's out, McCulloch.  Let's go.
Christ...where's Rennie??
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
 The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
Jason...Voorhees?
Have you seen Tamara?
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
But she might be in trouble...
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
I don't care about being hip anymore.
I'm sorry, but I've gotta find J.J.
Toby?
Tamara? Are you around here anywhere?
Tamara?
Tamara?  I just want to talk with you.
Toby? Where'd you go?
You had me worried to death!
But Sean said...
I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
I managed to scrounge this shit from the game room and hallways. Grab what you want.
What are you taking, Julius?
 Nothin'.
 We're talking the possibility of Jason Voorhees here.
Nothin' but this gun.
Can't we at least talk about it?
I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
This isn't a request.
Uncle Charles!
J.J. -- you down here?
We got a major problem, Wayne.
No...
No no no...
 I don't know.
 We could hit a reef, collide with another ship...we could be out here for weeks before anybody spotted us.
She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you. (like Sean isn't even in the room) Has he brought it back on course yet?
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
Well?
It worked...we're back on course!
What's that?
The fire alarm...
Can you shut that damn thing off??
There's only one person who needs to see it. And I'm going to find him.
I doubt very much that one even exists.
Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.
We have to get everybody together just in case the fire's for real.
I'll take the upper deck.
Miles??
Hhhhelp....me....
Hhhhelp me....I'm drowning...
Hhhhelp....me....
Rennie...??
 The window...
I don't understand what is happening to me...
It's gonna be okay...
What is it??
The power room...
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...
Is the ship going to sink??
I don't know.
The emergency lights just kicked in...
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
 I'm not going near any lifeboat!
But Rennie...
I'm not!!
Rennie??
Come on, answer!!
Water has gotten to the engines.  We have to get everybody off this ship...
What did you do with Rennie??
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
This is Jason's fault!
 Not another word, do you hear me??
Why aren't you with the others, woman??
Jason Voorhees is dead!!
Dear Christ...
We have to get off this ship!!
Everybody in -- I'll get the hoists
Get in the boat, Rennie!
I...I can't...
 You can and you will!!
Stop it!!
Toby...
Come on...faster....
Start rowing!!
He's gone...
It's Julius!
 If we don't find the shore soon we're all going to die.
Hey man, if I can make it, so can. you.
Hey man, wake up! Check it out!!
God damn, we're in New York! You did it, my man!!
Hhhhelp...me....
No!!!
Come on -- everybody up the ladder.
A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
No!
We can't let those gang-bangers get away, man...
You heard him! We have to call the police
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.
Please don't...
C'mon...
Get me the police -- this is an emergency...
Use the combos and keep the feet light...
Jason takes the first swing, Julius deftly dodging him and countering with left-right-left combination. They have absolutely no effect. Julius follows up with a round of kidney punches. Again, nothing. Julius finds himself being forced back against the rings, which in this case is the edge of the roof. He risks a glance backwards and sees:
Take your best shot, motherfucker...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
We have to find the others.
Freeze.
It's okay -- she's with me.
My apologies, Miss. My unit's right over here.
Hey!
Rennie, thank God...
Jason's here in New York.
Don't be ridiculous!
Is this the lass in question?
 Yes.
Who is...Jason?
He's a walking corpse, a phantasm from hell.
So try me.
You're right -- I find it a tall tale indeed. But you seem like honest folks so I'm inclined to believe at least some of it.
I'm sure he'll pop up soon enough. Why don't you climb in the back while I radio for backup.
There aren't any handles!!
Rennie, for God's sake slow down!!
Miss Van Deusen...
What a beautiful day.
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
That's what you said last year. I think the time for your first swimming lesson has just come.
You don't want to end up drowning like that Voorhees boy, do you?
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
He is not.
Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.
You're telling a lie.
Am I? Let's find out.
Better swim before Jason drags you down, Rennie. Come on, you can do it...
I...I can't...
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
Hhhhelp...me....
You pushed me...
 I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
You son of a bitch...
He was down there!!!
You keep away from her!
You...are...NOT POSSIBLE.
I was at school when they told me. 'Rennie, we have some very bad news... your parents have been killed in an auto accident.'
It seems like everybody I care about ends up...
Not this time.
Toby...
What's wrong, boy?
Hey!
Come on...
Hey pal, you can't do that...
NO!!!
It's over, Rennie. It's finally over.
God...please no...
Somebody help us!! He's going to kill us!!!
You're dead meat, slime bag.
Hey man, it's cool, it's cool...
 You have to call the police...
Please, hurry...
There's a pay phone in back.
...but it's broken.
You don't understand -- there's a maniac trying to kill us!!!
 Welcome to New York.
Look!
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Can you help us get out??
I sure can and we don't have a minute to waste.
What do you mean?
Toxic waste, son. This sewer floods out with the stuff on the 13th of every month, right at midnight.  And that's less than ten minutes from now.
Follow me.
Run, Rennie...
You never got me in the lake, Jason. And you're not going to get me now either.
Get up, Sean!!!
 Climb!!!
Mmmmmmmmmommy...DON'T LET ME DROWN, MOMMY...
Hhhhelp me....
I hear there's a statue here that's 22 stories tall.
Oh Toby...
