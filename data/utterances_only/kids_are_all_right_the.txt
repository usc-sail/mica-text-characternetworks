They walk inside.   We HEAR a baseball game on TV in another room.
B minus in geometry, yo!   This shits the bomb!
Add it up, son. Laser takes the bill, bends over and snorts a line.
Part Oxford reading room, part teenage girl's lair. Leaning against the bed we see JONI ALLGOOD . It's her room. She pours over a game of Scrabble.
Oh my God, Joni, there are so many hotties in your class. You are so gonna hook up the first week.
Just cause you're a 24 hour drive- thru doesn't mean everyone else has to be...
Hey, she worked her ass off! She deserves some hot jock sausage! Jai looks repulsed, and hurt.
 Whatever. Why don't you guys just do it and get it over with?
What? I'm just asking.
Uh, maybe because we're friends...
Oh, really...? Sasha turns to Joni like an agent provocateur.
Laser and Clay wrestle on the floor while Clay's DAD watches a baseball game on TV. They bump into the couch. Clay's dad looks back, menacing.
Hey, ladies! Take it down a notch.
What did I just say?!
Let me go!
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. CLAY Dad, your pits smell like burnt ass! Get off me! As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son, we note a trace of longing on his face.
6                                                                  6
7                                                                  7
Laser!   Knock it off!
What?!   I'm not doing anything.
NIC ALLGOOD  pulls up into the driveway beside a beat up white TRUCK covered in AA slogan bumper stickers.
Nic enters.   Drops her bag and heads for the table.
Hi guys.   Sorry I'm late.
Don't worry. We just started.
27 fibroids. All in the lining.
Honey, that's disgusting.   We're eating. JONI Did you do that laparoscopically?
That's right, Smart Girl.   And we got `em all.
Hey, whose truck is that?
Mine. NIC Yours?
For the business.
What business?..  The gardening?
 Isn't it landscaping. JULES Yes, thank you very much.
 Okay...  Do we have any Cabarnet left? JULES I didn't look, honey.
Hey, what's up?
Laser, no phone calls at the table.
 Lemme hit you back.
 Who was that? LASER Nobody.    Clay.
Can I ask you something? What do you get from your relationship with Clay? LASER What do you mean, "get"?
Do you feel like he's the kind of person who will help you grow? LASER Mom, you're windshield wiping me.
Hey, did you start on those thank- you notes for your birthday gifts?
Not yet.   But I will...
I just think it's easier to knock them out when it's fresh. JONI Yeah, I know, I'll do them tonight.
Great...I mean, you don't want to have to start with an apology. You know? Then it's embarrassing. JULES Okay, honey. She got it. Let it go. NIC Okay, I'll let it go...  I mean, if it was up to you, our kids wouldn't even write thank-you notes, they'd just send out good vibes.
I know...
 Big girl. You're a big girl... JONI Mom...
As Joni cranks out thank-you notes, Laser enters.
What? Laser looks nervous.
Have you thought any more about, you know, making that call...? JONI Yeah.   I don't want to.
Okay...I was just wondering if you changed your mind.
I haven't.
How can you not even be curious?
Sorry, Laser. I just don't want to, okay? I'm leaving soon and I don't want to deal with that right now.  And also, that could really hurt moms' feelings...
God, why do you worry about them so much? They don't even have to know about it!
Look, you can do it when you turn 18, okay? LASER I never ask you for anything.
I just don't understand why you bought the truck now.
Because if I'm starting this business I need something to haul my equipment in.
Okay. It just seems a little cart before the horse. JULES What does that mean? NIC Sweetie, you don't even have any clients yet. JULES Well you're the one who's always telling me to "act as if!"
 That's true. I do. You're right.
Look, I'm sorry. It's good you bought the truck. Its proactive.
Hey...
Wanna watch a movie?
A movie-movie?
Yeah. We haven't done that in a while.
I don't like the guys in this one. They're too shaved.
Don't focus on it. NIC How about the one with the biker gang?
We left it in Hawaii.
 I'm cold, honey.
Sorry.     I couldn't breathe. Jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner. The transition is awkward and Jules gets caught in the top sheet. As Nic repositions herself, she leans on the VOLUME CONTROL BUTTON and suddenly the porn is blasting at full volume.
Shit!!     Where's the remote?!
Joni turns to the wall, confused.    She hears the porno music pulsing though.
Nic finally recovers the remote and hits mute.
Jesus Christ! Nic flops back, traumatized.
The whole neighborhood heard that! JULES No, they didn't.
Well, that was a vibe kill.
Paul walks in carrying the box of tomatoes. He approaches TANYA,  the restaurant's super sexy hostess. PAUL How you doing, foxy?
Mm, flapjack, you're smelling ripe.
Oh, sorry... TANYA No, I like it. It's earthy.
What can I say. I've just been out there, you know...hoe-ing. (looking at the seating chart) How's it looking tonight? They stand close to each other, peering at the chart.
Gonna be tight. PAUL Really...
Hello.
Hi, is this Paul Hatfield?
It is.   Who's this?
My name is Wendy Minter. I'm calling from The Pacific Cryobank. PAUL Okay.   What can I do for you?
I just need to confirm that you donated sperm with us between 1991 and 1993. At the mention of the word sperm, Paul goes pale.
Yeah...I did a little bit of that back then...
Paul enters. The kitchen is humming with COOKS prepping for the dinner rush. He looks around for a quiet spot.
As you know the Cryobank has a confidentiality policy which prohibits us from releasing your identity without your consent.
Uh-huh. Paul heads to the back of the kitchen, searching for privacy.
Paul moves into the pantry, finds the farthest corner.
Well we've been contacted by a young woman conceived using your semen, and she's asked if you'd be open to having contact with her.
OMITTED 19                                                              19
You must of figured you'd get a call at some point.
Not really. I mean I was 19 when I did it. It was so long ago...I just figured no one actually used my stuff.
Why?     I'd use it.
 This is so weird. I mean, a part of me's really curious...
So what are you gonna do? PAUL I don't know.
Hello?
Paul anxiously paces his overgrown back-yard on his cell phone. He picks weeds as he talks. Conversation intercut.
Hi, I'm looking for Joni Allgood.
This is she...
Hi.  This is Paul...  Uh, your donor...?
Oh!   Hi...
Is this a good time to talk?
 Yeah...
Where are you going?     It's your turn.
So...  How are you?
I'm good.      How are you?
I'm well, thanks. Banal, awkward pause.     Paul jumps in to fill the void.
So, Wendy at the Cryobank said you call-- Joni cuts in, nervous and businesslike.
Actually, my brother   asked if I'd call you because I'm   18 and he's only 15 which is too   young to call-- anyway, he'd like to   meet you...if you want to...
 Your brother?
Yeah. Well, technically my half- brother. Each of my moms had a kid, you know, with your sperm... PAUL No.   I didn't know.
Oh. PAUL Both of them?
Yeah.
Like in two? JONI Uh huh.   Like in gay.
Good deal.     I love lesbians. Paul cringes at his lameness.     Joni doesn't know what to say.
26                                                                26
I just don't want you to have big expectations.
Will you quit saying that?    I don't have any expectations. JONI Okay. I'm just saying he might be weird. I mean, he donated sperm... LASER Well if he hadn't done it, you wouldn't be here. So respect, yo!
Paul sits alone at a table facing the entrance.   He nervously checks the door as customers enter.
Joni and Laser enter the restaurant.   They look nervous too.
Joni.    Hey. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too. Paul holds out a hand to Laser.
And Laser, right? LASER Right.
Very cool name.
Thanks.
Thanks for making the trek all the way over here. No one knows what comes next.
Cool, I got a table set up for us out here...
Listen, feel free and ask me anything you want, okay?  Or we can just hang out. That's fine too. Whatever you guys want.
Okay. Paul presses on, trying to break the ice.
Anything you want to ask me, Laser? LASER I...uh...I didn't really have any specific questions... PAUL  That's fine. I'd love to know about you guys. What about you, Joni? What are you up to? JONI Uh, well, I just graduated high school. I'm starting college in the fall. PAUL Oh yeah?     Congratulations.
Joni's the brains in the family. She won a National Merit Scholarship.
Shut the front door!
Yeah. And she got like an 800 on her Verbal SAT. JONI Okay, Laser...
What? I'm just saying you're really smart.
No, I just work harder than you. PAUL Don't stress it, Laze. School wasn't my thing either and I turned out okay. LASER  Laser. PAUL I'm sorry. Laser.  So tell me about you, Laser. What are you into? Laser freezes.   So his sister jumps in.
Laser's an amazing athlete. PAUL Oh yeah?
Did you play any sports in school?
I played a little basketball in junior high.
That's it?
Pretty much. The whole "team" thing got on my nerves, you know like, "Hey, let's go kick some ass, man!" What about you? LASER I play some Soccer. Basketball. Baseball. You know, team sports.
Hey, I wasn't bagging teams in general. Teams are great. I'm just weird like that.
Yeah, I like teams.
So this is your place?
Yeah, I've been working on it for a while. I also have this organic co- op farm down the road. We use a lot of the stuff we grow there for the restaurant. JONI  That's so cool.      I'm totally into local. LASER  You are?
Uh, yeah Laser! I've been like trying to get moms to buy local for forever.
So, like, do you raise pigs and stuff? PAUL No.  No pigs...  But it's a great spot. You guys should come check it out sometime.
Yeah...Definitely...
Is that yours?
Yeah.    You like motorcycles? LASER Yeah, but...our moms are kind of anti-motorcycle. JONI And by "kind of" he means they'd kill us if we ever rode one.
That's too bad.   They're fun.
Well it was great to meet you guys.
I hope this was okay.
Yeah...totally...thank you.
Really nice to meet you, Laser.
Yeah.
I just never pictured him that way. I just...I don't know...He was so cool and interesting. I can't believe that was him...He was so nice, you know?... LASER I guess...
You guess?
Yeah... JONI God, Laser! You're the one that wanted to meet him so bad!
I know.
Well what did you think of him? LASER I don't know. He seemed kind of into himself.
30                                                            30
Hey bug, come here. We're watching "Locked Up Abroad: Uganda." LASER I saw it.    It was gnarly. NIC Where are you going?
Clay's.
Don't be back late, okay?
I know. JULES Can I have a hug before you go?
Mom... JULES Just a quick one.   Please!
Hug her.    That's what she's there for.
Ugh. Maybe we should just sit him down and ask him already.
What?    "Are you and Clay fucking?"
"Exploring" is the word I'd use...
And what if he is "exploring?" This is the age for that. Why should we care?
We shouldn't...  I just don't understand why he's exploring with that loser.
Look, we don't even know what the deal is. We're jumping to conclusions. NIC I feel like he has so much potential and he's just wasting it.
What are you trying to say?
What do you mean, what am I trying to say?
It feels like there's some subtext here.
What are you talking about? JULES I don't know: Like mother like son? Is that it? Both of us aimless, wandering in the darkness, "wasting our potential?" Nic won't go there.
Okay, honey, you're on a whole other tangent and I have no idea what you're talking about.
Well, maybe it hasn't risen to the plane of consciousness for you yet.
Yeah.   Maybe not.
So what were they like?
Sweet. They were really good kids. The boy's kind of a sensitive jock and the girl's kind of innocent but whip-smart and super cute.
Sounds like you connected. PAUL Yeah, we kinda did.
Where'd you leave it?
We didn't really leave it anywhere. Brooke, the sexy Wiccan volunteer, comes up to Paul bearing a basket of freshly-picked fruits.
Hey Paul. Paul leans over the basket.
Whatcha got? Oh cool. First strawberries of the season.
Don't they look awesome? I thought you should have the first taste. And with that, she smiles, hands him the basket and leaves.
 "I thought you should have the first taste...of my pussy."
Whoa...
Dude, I don't think they smoke pot.
Hold up. Clay freezes. CLOSE ON a row of sex toys including a fancy pink, Japanese "all-in-one" dildo and a few DVD's.
Whoa!
Yo, it's alive!
Dude, put it back!! Laughing, Clay throws the dildo back in the drawer.    Then he grabs one of the DVDs and spins back around.
Dude, we're watching this.
Think the whole thing's like this?
Want me to fast-forward?
37                                                             37
38                                                             38
Jules pulls her truck into the driveway, almost running over Laser's bike.
Laser, your mom and I accept you and love you unconditionally? You know that, right?
Yeah.
And you know you can be open with us about anything.
Yeah, I know.
Laser, is there anything you want to talk about? LASER Like what? NIC Anything.     Anything on your mind.
Well there is something.
It's more of a question, really.
That's okay.
We won't judge you. Laser looks at his moms.       Nic and Jules brace themselves.
Why do you guys watch gay man-porn? Nic and Jules look at each other, thrown.
Well, first I have to say we rarely watch that movie-- Jules touches Nic's arm.
Honey... NIC And secondly, I really don't appreciate you snooping around our room. Was that Clay's idea? I have to say again, I don't like him. He seems untended...!
Honey, that's not what he asked--
 Fine. Do you want to answer his question?!
Well, sweetie, human sexuality is complicated. And sometimes, people's desires can be...counter- intuitive...  For instance, since women's sexual responsiveness is mostly internal, sometimes it's exciting for us to see sexual responsiveness more, you know...  ...externalized. Laser looks at them, still baffled.
Like with a penis. LASER But like, wouldn't you rather watch two women doing it? JULES You would think that. But in most of those movies, they've hired two straight women to pretend and the inauthenticity is just unbeara-- NIC Okay, that's enough! Laser, your mom and I have a sense there's some other stuff going on in your life and we just want to be let in.
What do you mean? JULES Are you having a relationship with someone?
You could tell us, honey. We'd understand and support you.
I just met him once.
What do you mean once?
Did he find you on-line?!
What?! NIC Who did you meet once?
Paul!    I met him with Joni. NIC Who's Paul?!
Why was Joni there?!
She set it up. NIC Forget the set-up!   Who is Paul?!!
Our sperm donor. Jules and Nic go white.
Wait, did you guys think I was gay?!
Joni has been pulled into the family conference. Nic and Jules are trying to remain as calm as possible. Nic slugs a gulp of wine.
Look, guys, we understand why you'd be curious about your biological father. That's totally natural.
But why didn't you tell us?
Because we knew you'd be upset.
WE'RE NOT UPSET!!
Honey... (to Joni; expressing her upset more calmly) We just wish you'd have included us in your thinking. But what's done is done. You met him, and now you guys can move on--
 Actually...  I want to see him again. JULES                             LASER You do?!                         You do?!
 Yeah. I was gonna tell you.
Whoa! Whoa! No. No way.  Nobody is seeing anyone until we meet him!
Yeah, I get it. He's their biological father and all that crap but it still feels really shitty. Like we're not enough or something, you know?
Of course I know. I don't want to time-share our kids with someone. Especially when it's Joni's last summer home. No way.
Jesus, Jules! The plumber was just here!
 Look, we need to be smart about this. If we act like grubby bitches, we're just gonna make it worse. JULES I know...
Let's just kill him with kindness and put it to bed.
I'm with you, honey.  We're gonna get through this, okay?
I love you, chicken.
I love you too, pony.
46                                                                46
Paul! It is so great to meet you. I'm Nic. This is Jules.
Hi, great to meet you two.
I hope the traffic wasn't too bad. PAUL No, I've got my bike so...I just sort of weave through.
Great.   Well, come on in.
This is for you. I don't know if you guys like wine... Nic takes it.
Are you kidding? We love it.  And a Petit Syrah. What a treat! Let me get some glasses.
Beautiful house.    How long you guys lived here? JULES Almost ten years. Wait, has it been that long?  We moved right after Laser broke his leg, I remember that because we had a ramp for a while, so that would have been...ten, no, nine? No, ten years this fall.
Okay.
You okay?
 Yeah. Fine.
Go easy on the wine, hon.   It's day time.
Okay. And same goes for the micro- managing...
Everyone sits at the picnic table.
I hope the food's okay. Joni told us you own a restaurant.
The food's great. Can't go wrong with salmon and corn. Nic finishes a glass of wine as Jules takes note.
So Paul, did you always know you wanted to be in food-services industry?
Well, I always liked food. NIC No, I was asking because I remember reading in your file, back when we were looking for, you know, sperm, anyway, you said you were studying international relations.
Oh yeah. Wow, that was a long time ago. Yeah, I was considering it, but then I dropped out of school.
You dropped out of college? PAUL Yeah, it wasn't my thing.
 No?    Why's that?
It just seemed like a massive waste of money after a while. I mean, I wasn't "doing" anything. I was just sitting on my ass listening to people spout off ideas I could've just as easily learned reading a book. Paul sees that his little rant may be alienating the moms.
I'm not saying higher learning uniformly sucks. I mean, college is great for some people.  PAUL Joni, I'm sure you're gonna love it. That's just me. I'm just weird that way.  Which is probably why I ended up in the food-services industry.
See what he did there, mom? You said "food-services industry," then he said "food-services industry..." NIC Yeah, I got it, Laser. Thanks.  So, Paul, what about your social life?
My social life? NIC You know, are you married, divorced, seeing anyone?
Mom!
What?   We're getting to know Paul. PAUL No, never been married or divorced. I date a little, but I'm just kind of focused on my work right now. NIC Oh.
So, how'd you guys meet?
We met at UCLA. I was a resident in the ER and Jules had an emergency. JULES My tongue went numb.
Really?
Laser, that's not nice.
What's not nice is subjecting your kids to the same story 1000 times! PAUL  What happened to your tongue? JULES I don't know. I just lost all the feeling in my face and tongue and I thought I might gag and then, you know... PAUL Choke?    Die?...
Yeah...exactly...
Well it was pretty clear to me she was just having an anxiety attack and she'd be fine.
So what'd you do for her? NIC Gave her a Vallium. Tried to get her to relax, talk, move her tongue around. LASER Mom, that's gross!
 Actually, she started teasing me and that really helped.
I was trying to distract you.
I know. And it worked. You were really funny. NIC You were really pretty.
So that's it. My tongue started working again.
And we've been glued at the hip ever since.
That's a great story. JULES  We like it.
So Nic, I know you're a doctor. How `bout you, Jules? What do you do? Jules never likes this question.
Well, I, you know, I studied architecture in college...
Right... JULES But I'm not an architect. I mean I was on my way to becoming one. But I quit before the kids were born. PAUL Well, that happens...
When they got a little older, I started a Balinese furniture import business...
Right on.
Yeah.   But that didn't work out.
Well, business aren't easy-- JULES Actually, I'm in the process of starting a new business.
Good for you. What kind? JULES Landscape design...  But not like a gardener! I mean, yes, there's a gardening component to it, but the real work is to create unique, eco-friendly outdoor spaces that harmonize with the surrounding environment. Do you know what I mean? PAUL Absolutely.
Hey Paul, did Joni tell you about her graduation speech? PAUL No, she didn't.
It was incredible. So full of wisdom and hope...  Hon, go get it. I'm sure he'd love to hear it... JONI  No, mom, I'm sure he wouldn't...
Sure he would.   Come on.   Go get it... JONI  No, it's okay...
Sweetie, don't be embarrassed.
I'm not embarrassed!   Jesus!     Give it a rest already!
I'll get the ice-cream. JONI  I'll help you.
 Honey, that's your forth glass. NIC Actually, it's my third.    But thanks for counting. Paul turns to Jules, trying to revive the mood.
Hey, I was just thinking. You know, I bought this place last year and the backyard's a wreck. Would you be interested in working on it?
 Oh, that's okay.
No, seriously. I don't have time to work on it myself.
Thank you. That's really sweet. Why don't you think about it. PAUL Why?  I just did.  I mean, if you're not up for it that's okay--
 No! I am!  I'm up for it!... Jules smiles at Nic: "Isn't this great?   My first client." Nic looks less than pleased.
49                                                                 49
...I'm just saying, the plan was to limit his involvement-- JULES You're unbelievable. You're all over me about getting clients, I finally get one and you're-- NIC He's not just a client, Jules. He's our sperm donor! Have you ever heard the phrase "Don't Shit Where You Eat?"
Yes, and I think it's disgusting. The two separate, go down separate isles.     When they rejoin, Nic is contrite.
I'm sorry. He just seemed sort of...self-satisfied to me.
Yeah, he was working the whole "alternative" thing pretty hard.
 "I just need to get outside and `do' things, not sit on my ass and learn. But that's just me. I'm weird that way."
...We could do a kind of a Secret Garden thing with trellises and topiary...  ...or something more Asian, minimal, with a rock garden feel. It's up to you... PAUL What do you think?
Personally, I'm tired of minimal. I'm into more is more. Let's not try to tame the space. I think it would look great all lush and overgrown and fecund... PAUL Fecund?
I'm sorry, you know, fertile...
No, I love that word. You just don't hear it that often.  More is more. Yeah. Let's do that.
What?
Sorry, I just keep seeing my kids in your expressions...
You and Laser have the same mouth.
You think so?
Yeah. The observation strikes Paul. Suddenly, he's feeling a kind of fast-tracked intimacy with Jules he hadn't expected.
Jules and Laser play Ping-Pong as Nic gets home with Chinese take-out for the family dinner.
What's the score?
Pretty close. Laser cranks a forehand that whizzes past Jules.
20-3...match point. NIC So how'd it go today?
Great.   We settled on a concept.
What is it?
It's hard to explain. You have to kind of see the space to get it.
 Laser, did you write Pup-pup a Get Well card?  Laser! What do I have to do?! I bought you a card. I left it on your desk. All you had to do was-- LASER Mom, settle! I will...
Don't tell me to settle, mister. And if it's not in the mail by tomorrow morning, we're not going to the Dodger game Saturday.
Whatever, I have other plans anyway.
What other plans?  I'm asking you a quest--
I said I'd do something with Paul! Laser serves a rocket, whizzing past a flailing Jules. He tosses the racquet on the table and leaves. Nic yells:
You used to be so cute!
We cut onto Paul and Laser, looking out at something.   Laser is holding a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA.
This may not be a good idea.
Are you filming?!
 He's not gonna make it.  Clay, you're not gonna make it!
I think he may be right, dude. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. CLAY Will you quit being a man-gina and run the camera! I'm only doing this once so keep my shit in frame! Laser sighs, then holds up the camera. Paul looks at Laser, wondering why he puts up with this guy.
ARE YOU OKAY?!
Did you get that?!
Seriously, dude, are you okay?
I'm fucking fine! Fuck! Did you fucking get it?!
Maybe next time we can hang out just you and me. LASER Clay's cool. He's just gets a little amped sometimes.
That's not amped.    That's being a dick. LASER He's not a dick, that's just his way. PAUL Okay...I just didn't like the way he was talking to you.
 Well, you don't know him.
 You're right...I don't...
Hey, can I ask you a question? PAUL Sure.
Why'd you donate sperm? PAUL Well, it's a lot more fun then donating blood. Laser doesn't laugh.    Paul realizes he's gonna have to give a "non-joke" answer.
I don't know, I guess I thought, you know, if I can help somebody in need, somebody who wants a baby...
So you did it to help people?
It was a long time ago...
How much did you get paid?
Why do you want to know? LASER I'm just curious. PAUL I don't know, like 60 bucks a pop.
That's it?
It was worth more back then.     You know. With inflation...  Hey, I'm glad I did it...
Hello? Donor Dad? Stone cold fox. JAI Must you take everything beautiful and make it dirty?
I'm just saying. Spermster's a hottie. Is he single?
Okay, first of all, ewww. Second, he's a really good person and I'd prefer it if you didn't taint him with your whore juice.
Fair enough, hairy muff. I'm outta here. You love birds can split my letters...
You want to keep playing?
Sure.
Sometimes I feel sorry for Sasha, you know... JONI Yeah...
It's like she has to sexualize every experience, you know? It's just sad... That stops Joni in her tracks.
Yeah, it is. It's really sad. Jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it.
Jules walks in to find Nic in sexy satin man-PJ's, sitting at the rim of a RUNNING BATH. There are candles burning.
Wow.    What's this?
Come here.     Sit down.
I'm sorry I've been such a bitch lately. I know I'm not being my highest self.
Yeah, well...
You've been really patient with me. I just want you to know that hasn't gone unrecognized.
Get in.
Oh god, chicken, that's the spot. NIC How's the water?
Perfect.    You wanna come in? NIC In a bit.     You enjoy it first.
Oh, I forgot the lavender salts.
No, don't stop...
No, I meant to put `em in....
Don't move...
Nic?!!
CUT TO THE KITCHEN -- 54                                                               54
No, we're planning on being here through mid-August so...  No, I promise, I'm not going anywhere.
59                                                               59
Look, I'm gonna go to the nursery in the morning so we should probably make sure you're signed off on the Bougainvillea...
What's that?
Strawberry rhubarb pie.      Fresh from my garden.
Good, huh?
Oh my god.     That is criminal. PAUL Have more.
No, please, just take it away... PAUL You had one bite.
I have another you may as well just tape it to my ass cause that's where it'll end up.
Hey now, don't go negative on your ass.
So...you're good with the plants?  Look, we don't have to do that. We could do go in a totally different direction if you--
No, I'm just thinking. Hang on.  Yeah, I'm good with the plants.
Sorry. Sometimes I mistake silence for criticism.
I wasn't criticizing you.
No, I know...I just...  Sometimes Nic can be a little critical, you know. She's a perfectionist.
That doesn't mean you have to be negative.
Excuse me, Senora? Hello?
What's up?
5 o'clock. JULES Yeah.     Okay.
Same time tomorrow?
Yes!    Same time!
Okay.     I'm gonna take off too...
 Same time tomorrow? Jules pushes Paul, laughing.
That's mean.
Here, take this...
No!
Just give it to the kids. JULES Okay!   God, you're such a pusher! Jules grabs the pie and gives him a kiss on the mouth, almost as a mistake. Before they know it, they're making out.
Whoa. I'm sorry. That was...I don't know where that came from... PAUL  It's okay...
Okay.   I'm gonna go now...
Jules...?
 ...but I shall return! Jules bolts for the door, clutching her pie.   Paul watches her go, stunned by what just happened.
So how'd it go with Paul?
 What do you mean?
I don't know. Did you break ground? Did you dig in? I don't know the terms.
No, we just talked...conceptually.
Oh, so it was less of a "doing" day, huh? Was he okay with that? JULES You know, maybe we should lay off the Paul digs a little. NIC Okay.   You're right.
And I also think we should start composting.
63                                                               63
Sweating and dirty, Joni and Paul pull radishes from the ground. They're in a zone together. Paul takes off his sun- hat and put it on Joni's head.
You got your mom's fair skin.     You didn't get my Mediterranean genes...
Thanks...
Ugh.    Ignore.
Who's that?
My mom, Nic. She's making me insane. PAUL Why?   What's she doing?
She's treating me like I'm 12. It's like she doesn't want to admit I'm an adult. PAUL She's your mom.     That's her job.
What? To smother me to death? That's not her job.
Well, if you want things to be different, you've got to make that happen. That's your job.
Laser walks with Clay. Clay sports a homemade arm-cast for the skateboard mishap we witnessed earlier.
That jump was cake, dude!    I so could've made it.
You were like 20 feet short, dude! There was no way.
Yeah, well if Paul wasn't there I could have landed it. That guy creeps me out.
Whatever. CLAY He's kind of a fag, dude. Tryin' to act all like your dad and shit.
Hey buddy.     Good boy.
I've seen this dog around.        I wonder if he's lost.
Let's pee on his head.
What? Clay unzips his fly.     It's difficult with the plaster cast.
Dude, don't do that. CLAY Come on.     Hold him...
Dude, Quit it!
 Duuude, quit it!
Go!   Run!    Get out of here!
Why are you such a fag?!
Why are you such a dick?!
Here, put this on. Joni takes the helmet and puts it on. Paul fastens the buckle for her. They get on the bike and take off down the hill.
Paul takes Joni home on his motorcycle via Sunset Boulevard. She holds Paul tightly.
The ladies sit in the living room watching TV.
Relax. She'll get home when she gets home.
Quit telling me to relax! They go back to watching TV.   After a beat, we HEAR a motorcycle pull up.
What the fuck...!
Funny how someone conveniently forgot to tell me they were driving home on a motorcycle!
Mom...
You know how many people I've seen come into the hospital paralyzed from motorcycle accidents?!
I'm a very safe rider...
That is so not the point I'm making! Joni knows this is something I'd never allow.
Mom, I'm 18 years old! I won't even be living here in like next month!
Yeah, well, you're living here now! JONI Yeah, well why don't you get a jump on it and pretend like I'm not!
She's never talked to me like that.
 You know, Nic. If you eased up on the restrictions, maybe there'd be less tension... NIC  Really? You think so, Paul?     Is that how it works? Jules walks up to intervene.
What's going on? NIC Oh, nothing. Paul's just giving me child-rearing lessons.
I was just saying--
Listen, when you've been a parent for 18 years, come talk to me! PAUL I was just making an observation.
Yeah, and I need your observations like I need a dick in my ass!
70                                                                70
Joni?  I was just upset. You know how I feel about motorcycles. Joni opens the door.
 I know how you feel about them. But I'm an adult now and you have to respect that. Goodnight.
72                                                                72
CLOSE ON Jules' thong peaking out of her jeans. Luis walks across Paul's field of vision, interrupting his reverie.
Paul?
Hey.    What's up? JULES Look, I'm sorry about last night. I'm really embarrassed.
Don't be.    She's the one who wigged out. JULES I know, she's just going through a lot of stuff right now... PAUL Jules, it's okay.      You don't have to defend her.
And look, I just want you to know, about the other day, the kiss, that's not something I...do. PAUL Yeah, I sensed that.
I just wanted to clear the air.
The air is clear.
Paul, I can't!
You don't want to?!
No, I do! It's just...  I have a guy outside!
75                                                              75
Oh.   Well.     Hel-lo!
What?
Nothing. Paul flips her on her hands and knees and they go at it some more.
Hello?   Excuse me, Senora Allgood?! They stop mid-thrust.
You gotta be fucking kidding me! She dislodges from Paul and starts dressing furiously.
Jules runs out to meet Luis, waiting patiently at the door.
What's up?
Where do you want the stones?
 The stones? Over by the fence.
 What? I was using the bathroom.  Do you need to use the bathroom?
That's H. PAUL I know.
Lay-up.
Hey, don't take it easy on me cause you're winning--
Nobody likes a show-off.
Hey, can I ask you a question?
Oh god.   Okay. Hit me.
When you die do you want to be buried or cremated?
That's your question?
I want to be cremated.
I think I'd rather be buried. LASER Why? That's just taking up more space in the earth.
I don't know, something about the idea of being burned into this chalky powder and sprinkled--
What do you care?   You won't even be conscious.
That's true. I guess I just want to be in a place where people can visit me.
 But why?! You'll be dead! You won't even know they're there!
Joni and Sasha are at a table eating dinner. Tanya has temporarily joined them. Sasha checks out Tanya's oversized African bead necklace. Joni watches Paul charm customers. SASHA God, I love your necklace!   Where'd you get it?
I don't know, some flea market--
In Africa?
No, more like Pasadena.
Well, it's really awesome. Paul saunters up to the table and stands behind Sasha.   He mindlessly places his hand on Sasha's shoulder. PAUL Sorry guys, I need to steal Tanya back now. Sasha clocks Paul's hand. She carefully and without looking back places her hand on top of his.
That's okay, Paul. TANYA  Well ladies, it was fun talking with you. SASHA/JONI You too.
Okay, I'm sorry but your donor daddy is giving me the sex vibe. JONI No he's not. He wouldn't do that.
Why not?    He's not my dad.
God Sasha, that's totally gross! Not everybody wants to have sex with you, okay? Especially when you act like a slut.
Fuck you.
Well it makes you seem insecure and desperate. SASHA I'm not insecure and desperate! I'm just a normal sexual person! And maybe you'd get that if you weren't so uptight!
Fuck you.    I'm not uptight!
Nic and Jules dine with their friends, JOEL and STELLA. Nic's drinking like a fish.
Oh my god, these heirloom tomatoes are insane.
Joni brought some home from Paul's garden the other day. They were huge!
So, the kids have been spending time with him?
Oh, yeah, they're spending all kinds of quality time together.
 Well, it's great they like him so much.   You know, you hear these stories about kids meeting their donors and the guys end up being nothing like they were on paper. NIC No, everyone's getting along famously. Apparently Paul can do no wrong... Nic grabs a passing waiter by the arm.
Can we get another bottle of the Seavey Cabernet? Jules gives Nic a look.   Joel and Stella feel the tension between them.
Hey, have you guys tried those Aai fruit packs?
No, but they're pushing them like crack at Whole Foods.
I know.    Joel's addicted.
What I do is I throw one in the blender with some bananas, frozen strawberries and hemp milk and I'll tell you, it's sensational.
Oh, just fucking kill me...
Honey...
I'm sorry guys, but I just can't, with the fucking hemp milk and the organic farming and heirloom tomatoes.  "Oh no, don't throw that in the trash, no man, you gotta throw that into the composting bin so the fucking worms can shit all over it and turn it into glorious multch and we can all feel better about ourselves." God! What a bunch of bullshit!
 How about some green tea, honey... Nic slams her glass on the table.   Explodes.
You know what, Jules?! I like my wine! Okay? So fucking sue me! And fyi, red wine has a chemical called Resveratrol in it, which has been proven to significantly extend human lifespan!
Yeah, if you drink a thousand bottles a day!
Fuck you. Nic storms off.   Jules turns to Joel and Stella, ashen.
I'm sorry.
What the hell is going on with you?
This whole Paul thing is driving me crazy! I feel like he's taking over my family.
No. He's not!
 Okay! Okay. I'm sorry.      I'm just exhausted...
Maybe you need to take some time off and recharge.
 Sure, and who's gonna pay for that? Jules looks pissed off, and hurt.
Look, I'm sorry, I just feel like I'm carrying the whole load here.
Because that's the way you like it! That's the way you keep control!
What are you talking about?
Oh come on! You hated it when I worked! You wanted me at home, taking care of the kids. You wanted a wife!
That is just not true!
You didn't trust any of those nannies! And you sure as hell didn't back my career!
What are you talking about? I just helped you start another business! JULES Yeah, so you can feel better about yourself! NIC No, so you can feel better about yourself!
Are you even attracted to me anymore?
Do you still want this?
No. Just the check please.
God, I feel so drugular right now.  I really want a cigarette! Do you have any? I haven't had a cigarette since Laser was born. Do you smoke? PAUL Sometimes. But I don't have any here. Want me to run to the store?
 Yeah. Wait, no. Don't.     Sorry.
Do you think I'm just like some sad- sack middle-aged lesbian?
God, that's it. I was trying to figure out how to describe you to my friends. Thank you.
You want to get that? PAUL No. I want to get this...
Hi Paul. It's Joni. I just wanted to apologize for my friend, Sasha. I was really embarrassed when she put her hand on your--
Hey, Joni.     I'm here...
No. Honestly. I didn't even notice...
Hey, Joni?     Can you hold on a second?
Did you go to Home Depot? LUIS Yeah.   I just got back.
That was fast!
Yeah, no lines.
What's that look? LUIS What look? JULES The look you're giving me right now! LUIS That's no look.     That just my face.
Look, I'm not gonna play this game with you! You need to keep your judgements to yourself!
Senora, I didn't give no looks! JULES I don't ask you why you keep blowing your nose constantly! I mean, if you have a drug problem that's your business...
I don't have no drug problem! I have the allergies! JULES Then why are you a gardener?!
Cause I love the flowers.
Look, this isn't gonna work. I'll pay you through the end of the day and then we're done.
The family sits in silence, having breakfast.     Nic looks around the table, feeling like a pariah. NIC Look, I know you've all been enjoying your time with Paul. And I know I haven't been as open to him as everyone else and this has caused some...friction...between us. But I'd like to try and change that... Everyone keeps eating, uncommitted.   "And...?"
So I was thinking. Maybe it would be nice if we all had dinner at his house sometime. That way, I could get to know him a little better, and I could see all the good work mom's been doing with his backyard. Nic looks at Jules and smiles. Everyone nods.     They recognize this is a big step for Nic.
86                                                                   86
How's it going? JULES Okay...
Here, let me help.
We can't be doing this...
I know...
I'm married... PAUL ...and the kids...
Yeah, and I love Nic.
I know... They stare at each other and we cut to...
Paul and Jules lie in bed. Jules looks nauseated.   Paul offers her a pack of smokes.
I got you some cigarettes. JULES  Jesus, what's wrong with me? I shouldn't have fired Luis like that. That was totally wrong...
Come on. Don't be so hard on yourself. Things get messy sometimes...
That wasn't messy. That was fucked up. I'm totally fucked up...
I think I'm really falling for you.
Paul, don't...
Jules takes a shower, washing off the evidence.   She looks nauseated by her lack of willpower.
Pretty good night. That table had like 5 bottles of wine. PAUL Wow.    Yeah. Good night.
Joni's pretty. She's got some of your genes.
I think she looks more like her mom actually. But thank you.
It's cute seeing you in dad mode. PAUL Yeah?
Yeah.  It makes me want to fuck you.
 Oh yeah?...
Yeah... Tanya moves imperceptibly closer.
I've been missing our sleep-overs.
Yeah, it's been a while.
You want to meet up later?
Tanya, you're so sexy and beautiful, but I don't think we should do that anymore.
What happened?
You know, our thing is really fun and easy, but...I don't want to be 50 and still "hanging out." You know? If I really want a family then I have to stop getting in these situations that don't go anywhere. Paul just looks at her.   Tanya gets it.
 Oh.
TANYA Fuck you.
I'm gonna do some planting over there so it won't look so bare...
It looks great, honey. Very indigenous. I'm so proud of you.
Hey, so how's that guy Luis working out?
Oh, I had to fire him.
 Really?! JULES Yeah, he had a drug problem.
Whoa.   What kind of drugs?
Blow, I think...
Hey Nic, I think you're gonna love this `98 Screaming Eagle. NIC You know what, I think I'm gonna stick with water tonight. But thank you so much. The Allgoods look at Nic: this is a first.
God, Paul, this steak is delicious. What's the seasoning?
I just mist it with a little truffle oil.
What a good idea. We should try that. Right, honey?
 Mmm-hmmm.
And it's done to perfection.
So it's not too rare? NIC No, it's perfect. Juicy. Tender. Exactly what rare's supposed to be.
Good. A lot of people in the restaurant order a steak rare and they freak out at the slightest sight of red. NIC Ugh, isn't that annoying? That happens to me all the time when I'm grilling.
Don't people know that rare means red? NIC Right?!   It means bloody!
Exactly! They should see what rare looks like in Argentina. The cow's practically still mooing. Laser chuckles at Paul's joke, then reigns it in.   Joni tries to insert herself in the conversation.
I really want to go to Argentina. Buenos Aires is supposed to be--
 ...So Paul, I was checking out your album collection over there. Quite the eclectic mix...
Thanks...
You don't meet too many straight guys who love Joni Mitchell. Joni glares at Nic: stop being such a Paul hog.
Oh yeah, you a Joni Mitchell fan? NIC  Not really. We just named our daughter after her. PAUL Cool. Right on...
What's your favorite Joni album?
I think I have to go with "Blue." Nic raises her hand in a testify.
Yeah?   You too?
Oh God, I probably spent half of high school in my room crying to that album. That record kills me.
I know, it never lets up, you got "River," "California..."
"A Case of You..." PAUL "All I Want.."
Mmm!!
NIC I am on a lonely road and I am traveling traveling, traveling, traveling/Looking for something, what can it be/Oh I hate you some, I hate you some/I love you some Oh I love you/when I forget about me...
I want to talk to you/I want to shampoo you/I want to renew you again and again/Applause, applause/ Life is our cause/When I think of your kisses/My mind see-saws...
Do you see/do you see/do you see how you hu-urt me baby/so I hurt you too/then we both get/soo-ooo- ooo blue...
Don't quit your day job, mom.
Hey. It's hard enough to open your heart in this world. Don't make it harder. LASER You're right.  I'm sorry, mom. Nic looks at Paul.    Stunned.   Then looks at Jules and points to Paul.
I like this guy.
You didn't tell me you were named after Joni M.
It's just so dorky. I don't really like to bring it up.
I think it's cool. NIC  Hey Paul. Where's your bathroom?
Just around there.
You know what? I think I will try some of that Screaming Eagle.
Nic on her knees in Paul's shower, pulling a clump of tell- tale red hair from the drain.
Nic skulks out of the bathroom.   She looks out and b-lines for the bedroom.
Nic pulling pillows off Paul's bed.   Her look tells us she's found hair here as well.
Paul and Jules talking comfortably.
96                                                                 96
Nic and Jules perform their nightly ablutions.   Jules is sonic-caring her teeth.
 Well, you and Paul seemed to get on like gang-busters...
You're sleeping with him, aren't you. JULES  What?
Just be honest with me. Don't make me feel crazier than I feel right now!
Where is this coming from?!
I found your hair in his drain! JULES  What? I was working.    I got dirty so I took a shower. NIC Oh yeah?   You take a nap, too?
Are you in love with him?!
No! NIC What, are you straight now?!
No. It has nothing to do with that!  JULES  I've just felt so cut off from you lately... NIC Oh, right, so it's my fault!
No! Who said anything about fault? Just listen to me!
I'm listening!   What?!
I just needed... NIC What?   To be fucked?
No, appreciated!
It's always what I'm not doing for you, isn't it? Well here's what I don't to you. I don't work out my issues by fucking other people!
He's not just "other people!"
No, you had to go fuck our sperm donor! You couldn't have picked a more painful way to hurt me...
Where are you going?! NIC I need water! My mouth is dry!
Jules wakes up looking crusty from a rough night on the couch. She looks like she hasn't slept at all.
Hey Laser.     Honey?
What?
Listen, I know you and Joni heard what's going on. I just want you to know that what happened with Paul and me is over. There's nothing going on now. LASER Okay.
I know you might need some time to process your feelings around this, but I just want you to know that I'm here for you if you want to talk about anything.  Is there anything you want to talk about?
 Not really.
 Okay then. Go back to sleep.
Joni?
I don't want to talk to you.
Can we just--
I said I don't want to talk to you!!
Okay.   I'm sorry.
103                                                               103
She's a wreck. I've never seen her like this before.
Is it him...?
 Hello.
Hey Joni, how you doing?
You're such a phony.
Excuse me?
You act like you're so groovy and together but you're not. You're a shitty person!
What happened? JONI With my mom?!
Listen, can I just come and talk with you--
What's wrong with you?! PAUL Joni...
Don't call me anymore. Joni hangs up and start crying.    Sasha hugs her.
Sweaty, nauseous with remorse, Paul turns around to find fetching young Brooke, waiting for him with a wicker basket of huge cucumbers. BROOKE Hey Paul, look at these cukes...
Jules sits on a lawn chair smoking a cigarette.    Her cell rings. She answers.
Hey, it's me. I just talked to Joni. Conversation intercut.
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.   I should have called you. Jules sucks a big, anxious drag off a cigarette.
What happened? JULES Nic saw my hair in your bathroom.
The other night.
Yeah. PAUL Fuck...
Yeah. Beat.
Listen, it's all out in the open now. Let's make this happen.
Paul...
No, I'm serious. Fuck it. Let's get the kids together and do this thing.
Paul, come on...
No! I'm sick of this life. I want a family. I'm ready--
 Jesus, Paul! I'm gay!
Slow down, tiger.
I like the scruff.   It's sexy.
Uh, `scuuuse me...
You're excused.  Hey, can I talk to you?
Joni...Joni...
What?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine... Joni pulls free and escapes, leaving a confused Jai in her wake.
Just getting another pillow.   The couch is kind of saggy.
Is your back okay? Jules perks up: is this an invitation to share the bed again?
It's a little ache-y. NIC You should take some Advil.
Suddenly they hear bumping and loud footsteps downstairs.
Hey.    How was the party?
Fine.
How big was it? JONI I don't know. Medium...ish...
Are you drunk?
No. Nic enters from the stairs, having caught the last piece.
I hope you had a designated driver. JONI Why?    I'm not drunk.
Well, you seem drunk to me.
Yeah, well, you should know. NIC  What did you just say to me?!
I'm going to bed.
No, you're not!    I'm not done talking to you!
What do you want from me?! I did everything you wanted! I got all A's! I got in everywhere I applied! Now you can show everybody what a perfect family you have! JULES Don't talk to your mom like that! Joni spins to face Jules.
You're really gonna tell me how to act? Now?!
Hey, I'm still your mother. JONI Whatever...
Don't touch me!
I'm so sick of both of you!
The sun rises on this formerly happy home.
Jules wakes up on the couch.   Sits up.   Rubs her aching back.
Joni packs for college. The room is littered with half- filled packing boxes. She picks up a pile of clothes from the corner and sees the farmer's hat Paul gave her. She puts it aside, not sure what to do with it.
Did you pack that lamp I gave you?
Yeah. NIC Well, we can always get stuff up there, too, if you need it, I mean if the room's dark or you need extra bedding... JONI I'm not going to Siberia, mom.
I can't believe this is our last dinner together. LASER Oh God, are you gonna cry?
I wish you were gay.    You'd be so much more sensitive.
 What are you doing here?
I needed to talk to you before you left. JONI There's nothing to talk about.
I just want to apologize again for what happened. I can't tell you how much I regret it.
So like, everything that happened between us. What was that? Was that just bullshit?! PAUL No, it wasn't bullshit at all. I know I don't seem credible right now but I really care about you... Paul struggles to keep his emotions in check.
...and I just hope someday we'll be able to see each other again. Do you think that could maybe happen?
I don't know... Joni looks down welling up.
I just wish you could've been... PAUL What?
Better...
You've got some balls, mister!
Nic, hold on...
No, you hold on! Let me tell you something, you really hurt my kids! PAUL Well, they're kinda my...
 No! They're not. This is not your family. This is my family! You're just a fucking interloper... Jules joins Nic, concerned things are getting out of hand.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone... Paul and Jules share a look as Nic deals the coup de grace.
If you want a family so much, go out and make one of your own! Nic heads back inside and slams the door behind her.
I need to say something.
Look, it's no big secret your mom and are in hell right now. Bottom line...marriage is hard...really fucking hard. Just two people, slogging through the shit, year after year, getting older, changing. It's a fucking marathon, okay?! Everyone is silenced by the outpouring.   Jules soldiers on.
So sometimes you're together so long, you just stop seeing the other person. You just see weird projections of your own junk. And instead of talking to each other, you go off the rails, and act grubby and make stupid choices. Which is what I did. And I feel sick about it because I love you guys and I love your mom and that's the truth. Sometimes you hurt the ones you love the most. I don't know why. Maybe if I read more Russian novels I would...
Anyway, I just wanted to say how sorry I am about what I did and that I hope you'll forgive me eventually.  Thank you.

The Allgoods are on the road, heading to college.

The station wagon passes through the campus.
As they drive past buildings and dorms, Joni sees STUDENTS swarming the campus. She takes it all in, nervous, excited. Nic and Jules steal looks back at Joni, feeling her nervousness, wishing they could take it away.
Laser dollies Joni's boxes though the corridor and while Joni and the moms follow behind.
Guys, it's okay.   I got it.
Where'd you go?!
We had to move the car.
I thought you left. JULES We wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
Give us some credit.
It's gonna be weird not having you at home.
Sorry to leave you alone with them.
It's okay.     I can handle it. Laser backs up. Then the moms both come up and hug Joni, tears streaming down their faces.
Guys, come on...  Look, I'll talk to you soon.
The family drives home. Jules is at the wheel. Nic's in the passenger seat, eyes red and puffy. Laser's in the back.
I don't think you guys should break up. A long beat.
No?   Why's that? LASER I think you're too old.
Thanks, Laser.
