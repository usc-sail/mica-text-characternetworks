 That was pretty what you were whistling.  Whistle some more.
 You got a cigarette?
Oh, I think so--
 Filter tips.
 You smoke it.  Smoke it, Dad.
 I'll light it for you, Dad.
Mixed up in that beating on Twelfth Street?
No.  Plain drunkenness.
This says he was picked up there.
They had him on the carpet for an hour at Headquarters.  He's clear. Plain drunkenness.
Young squirt.  All right--You want to lean him against something? Stand him over there.
You going to tell me your name now?
 Where's your hair?
It's all gone.
Did you get a haircut?
No--it just fell out!
 Aw--
What gang does he belong to?
Give him a couple of years.
Where's your mamma, honey?
I don't know.
Judy--we're ready for you now.
 He hates me.
What?
He hates me.
What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
 He doesn't like anything about me-- he calls me--he calls me--
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
 He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Do you think your father means that?
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
That one?
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
You weren't looking for company, were you?
No.
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
I'll never get close to anybody.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
She wouldn't give me their number.
What's your number, Judy?  We'll see if your Dad will come and get you.
Unless you really don't want to go home.  Would you rather stay here?
Lexington 05549.
Hey!
 Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Yes, ma'am.
You shivering, John?  You cold?
Want my jacket?
 You want my jacket?  It's warm.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
 What?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
 My mother?
She's being called for.
You said you'd call my father.
Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.
John Crawford?
Yes, sir.
Come with me, John.
Jim!
Happy Easter.
Where were you tonight?  They called us at the club and I got the fright of my life!
Where were you tonight, Jimbo?
You think I'm funny?
 Why didn't you take my jacket?
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
 Plato.
You talk to the man nice now, hear? He's going to help you.
Nobody can help me.
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?
No, sir.  I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it.  I guess I'm just no good?
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Where did you get the gun?
In my mother's drawer.
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
She's away.
Seems like she's always going somewhere.  She got a sister in Chicago and she go for the holiday. She says her sister is all the family she has. GENE Where's your father?
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
Do you hear from him, son?
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
 Head-shrinker?
 Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
Well maybe she better start.
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
You don't?
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
 Say, listen--
 Jim--don't hum.
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
Listen--can't you wait till we get home?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
Sorry.
What about you, Jim?  Got anything to say for yourself?
Not interested, huh?
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
He's just loaded, honey.
I was talking to Jim.
 Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
Tell him why we moved here.
Hold it, Jim.
You can't protect me.
 You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
Then what is it?  I can't even touch you anymore but you pull away. I want to understand you.  Why'd you get drunk?  You must have had a reason.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
He said a little drink.
 You're tearing me apart!
What?
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
That's a fine way to behave!
 Well you know who he takes after!
Outside, Jim.  Come outside.
Excuse us a minute?
 Sure.  Sure.
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Grandma?
Get lost.
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
Wash up and go home.
Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
 Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
No.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
Leave me alone.
No.
I don't know why--!
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
Try the desk.
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
Mess that kid up?
 He called me chicken.
And your folks didn't understand?
They never do.
So then you moved?
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
But you don't think that's a solution.
 Things pretty tough for you at home?
She eats him alive and he takes it.
What a zoo!
What?
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
Pretty mixed up?
If he could--
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
 Chicken?
I bet you see right through me, don't you?
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
 Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
 Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Okay--
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
 You serious?
I'm sorry.
All right, darling.
 This was all very unfortunate, but he made a mistake and he's sorry-- so we're not going to have any more trouble.  He's always been a lovely boy--
Lovely!  Grandma--if you tell another lie you're going to turn to stone.
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
 Have some cigars.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
Frank--he doesn't want any.
 Beau!
 What are you trying to do, get yourself killed?
 Yes!
Your eggs are on the table, dear.
 Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
 It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
It's a wonder we don't all have TB or some other terrible disease after living in all those smokey cities!
Well, drink your milk anyhow.
 There aren't so many factories here.
Mother--
 You make any sandwiches?
My first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess--
 There's nothing to be nervous about. Here's peanut butter and meat loaf--
What did I tell you?  Peanut butter!
Well, there's a thermos of orange juice and some apple-sauce cake in the wax paper to wash it down.
I baked that!
 'Bye, Mom.
Goodbye, dear.
 So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
And listen--watch out about the pals you choose--Know what I mean? Don't let them choose you--
Come out of the alley, Beau!  This is the last time I'm going to call you.
Beau!  All right--go to school alone!
 Hey!
 Hey, didn't I see you before some place?
Hi.  I saw you before.
Bully for you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
Now that's true!
 See?
"Life is crushing in on me."
 "Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Where what was.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
 Who lives?
See, I'm new.
Won't mother be proud.
You're really flipped--aren't you.
 Where's Dawson High School?
You going there?
Yeah--why--
Dig the square wardrobe!
 Yeah.  So where's the high school?
 University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
I was just getting my car.  I could take you.
The kids take me.
Oh.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
A what?
 Goodbye!  See you!
 I'm not so bad.
Stella-a-a-a!
Steady Marlon!
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
 What's that?
A new disease.
 Friend of yours?
I'm glad they let you out.
Nobody chickened.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
They always live.
Where's University and 10th? JUDY  That way!
 That way!
 That way!
Hi--can you tell we where I go? I'm just starting here.
 Mr. Bassett's office--203.  He'll tell you where your home room is--
Thanks a lot.
 Hi.
 Hi.
Hi there.
You remember me?
No.  I don't think so--
I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
For many days before the end of our earth people will look into the night sky and notice a star, increasingly bright and increasingly near.
As this star approaches us, the weather will change.  The great polar fields of the north and south will rot and divide, and the seas will turn warmer.
The last of us search the heavens and stand amazed.  For the stars will still be there, moving through their ancient rhythms.
The familiar constellations that illuminate our night will seem as they have always seemed, eternal, unchanged and little moved by the shortness of time between our planet's birth and its demise.
Orion, the Hunter.
Boy!
 What?
 Once you been up there, you know you been some place!
Gemini, the Twins.
 Cancer, the Crab.
I'm a crab!
Taurus, the Bull.
 Moo!
 Yeah, moo.
Moo.  That's real cute.  Moo.
Hey, he's real rough--
I bet he fights with cows.
Moo.
Sagittarius and Aries--all as they have ever been.
You shouldn't monkey with him.
What?
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
I don't want to make friends.
And while the flash of our beginning has not yet traveled the light years into distance--
Has not yet been seen by planets deep within the other galaxies, we will disappear into the blackness of the space from which we came.
Destroyed as we began in a burst of gas and fire.
 The heavens are still and cold once more.  In all the complexity of our universe and the galaxies beyond, the Earth will not be missed.
Through the infinite reaches of space, the problems of Man seem trivial and naive indeed.  And Man, existing alone, seems to be an episode of little consequences.
That's all.  Thank you very much.
Hey, it's over.  The world ended.
What does he know about Man alone?
 May I have your attention?  May I please have your attention? Classes will meet at the busses outside.  May I have your attention?  The heck with it.
Excuse me.  Excuse me.
John, where you going?
I forgot something.  I'll get a hitch.
What you looking at?
Nothing.
 What's your name!
Jim.  What's yours?
 Plato.  It's a nickname.
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.
I know.  That's why I came back.
You scared?
I just don't want trouble.
He has a knife.
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
No.  It's perpetual motion.
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
Jim?
I'm here.
 They're still there!
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
No.  In the morning.
I just have a feeling.
If you don't want trouble, I know a place we can go--
It's a big mansion and we could sneak around there and they wouldn't even know.  You could be safe--
There it is.
Should we go?
 The shadows are getting long.
 Le soleil tombe dans la mer.
 You know something?
What?
 You watch too much television.
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
I'm cute, too.
Meaning me?
What?
Chicken?
You shouldn't call me that.
 You always at ringside?  You always travel in this rank company?
I thought only punks fought with knives.
Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
Les jeux de courage!
 Machismo.  Machismo.
Machismo?
Somebody find him a knife.
Jim!
You know the action?  No cutting. Just sticking--jab real cool.
 What you waiting on, Toreador?  I thought you wanted some action!
Big brave bull.  Hah!  Toro!  Hah! Hah!
Moo!
Come on--Fascinate us.  Impress us. What's happening?  Let's go!
I don't want trouble. BUZZ  You crud chicken!  You're wasting our time!
Yeah--that's pretty close.  How about a little closer, Toreador? Cut off a button and you get to join the club!
 Mr. Minton!  Mr. Minton!  Trouble!
Look.  There's your audience.
Oh, I don't think so.  From the school?
Ole!  Ole!
Buzzy!  Look out!  He's got a chain!
 Hey!  Chicken Little! BUZZ trips PLATO quickly and kicks him while he's down. CRUNCH grabs the chain.
All right--you want it, you got it!
Honk.  Let's split.
Split for what?  Couple old poopheads?
You satisfied or you want more?
How 'bout you?  Say the word and you're cold, Jack--you're dead.
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
Where can we meet?
Know the Millertown bluff?
The bluff, Buzz!  That's dangerous up there.
Draw him a picture, Chicken Little. Eight o'clock.  Cookie, you call Moose and get a couple cars.  We're going to have us some real kicks. Little chickie-run.  You been on chickie-runs before?
Sure--that's all I do.
All right--all of you--start moving!
You mean l'il ol' us?  What's the matter with the nice man?
Don't clown with me.
Why'nt you go suck on something sweet?
You think you're tough?  I got a son twice your size and I can still handle him.
Don't lose control, Mr. Jamison.  I think if we just explain--
Explain to these?  They think they own the world!
The world is round!
The world is flat!
All the world's a stage!
The world goes round the sun! Goodbye proud world! I got the world on a string! The world's my oyster! Hey!  A fish-eater!  Brain food.
 Sometimes the world is too much with us, isn't it, son?  What was the disturbance?
Nothing.
You're bleeding.  Are you all right?
I scratched my mosquito bites.  I'm fine.
I'm fine--thanks!
Are you really going to meet them?
Who knows.  Plato?
What?
What's a chickie-run?
Mom?
Hiya, Jimbo.
You thought I was Mom?
Yeah!
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
 And you dropped it?
 Yeah!  Shh!
That's funny!
I better clean this up before she sees it.
Let her see.  What could happen.
Dad--
Dad--don't.  Don't.
Time now for the seven o'clock news. Friends, the next time you go shopping.
Judy.
What are you wishing for, Judy?
 I wasn't wishing.  I was looking at the moon.
 "Man in the Moon, how came you there-- Up in the sky where you are shining-- Floating so high in the frosty air--? Oh, say--Man in the Moon!"--
 How did you know that?
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
We were romantic then too--
Are you and Mom home tonight?
No.  Why?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
 Daddy--
Good evening.
Hi.
 Didn't you forget something?
What?
 What's the matter with you?
 You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
 I didn't want to stop.
Didn't want to stop what?
Nothing.
I was talking to Dad.
I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
 Bertha!  You can serve the souffle!  Fish souffle.  You don't have to stand there, darling.  Drink your tomato juice.
I guess I just don't understand anything.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Why?
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
 Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
Stop it now!  Sit down!
 Hi, rascal.
 Hi.
May I please be excused?
 Hey, hey, Glamorpuss.  I'm sorry.
 I don't know what to do.  All of a sudden she's a problem.
She'll outgrow it, dear.  It's just the age.
 The atomic age!
 It's the age when nothing fits.
You awake?
Yes.
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
I'm not hungry.
Hey--I want to ask you something.
 Shoot, Jimbo.
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
 Is there some kind of trick answer?
What would you do, Dad?
 I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
Blood.
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
We don't have time.
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Well, now--
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
Jim?  Will you listen?  You can't go out till we--Jim!
Jim?  Jim!
 Hey, Chicken-Little.
Where's Toreador?  He beg off?
He's not scared of you.
 Yeah?  Goon!  You seen that adolescent type anywheres?
He won't show.
Well, you going to wait all night? I'm getting nervous, man!  We got to do something!
 Hey, Buzz!
What?
Over there.
How'd you get here?
I hitched.
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
No.  It's okay.
Come on.  Let's see what we're driving.
Just him.
Stay there.
What you say your name was?
Jim Stark.
Buzz Gundersen.
Hi.
Glad to meet you.
Got some goodies for you, Buzzie-boy.
Flashlight?
Looks good.
Clean as a whistle.  They both got plenty breeze.
Look good to you?
Sure.  It's fine.
Okay.
Is he your friend?
Yes.  My best friend.
What's he like?
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Okay.
Better try the doors.  Jump out.
No--quick, man!  You got to break quick.
 This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
Yeah.
I like you, you know?
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
 We got to do something.  Don't we?
Feel okay?
Give me some dirt.
Hey, Toreador!  She signals.  We head for the edge.  The first guy who jumps--chicken!
What's happening?
Good luck, Buzz.
 Judy.
Me too.
Thank you.
Hit your lights!
 Oh!
 Where's Buzz!  Where's Buzz!
 Jim!  Jim!
 Down there!  Down there is Buzz!
Come on, Jim!  We got to get out of here!
Get up!  Get up!  Come on!
Go on!  Move!
 This is fine--
 Judy.  Will you be okay?
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Who has?
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to-- (pauses--then excitedly as though an idea had suddenly struck him) Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
 Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
 O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
 Hello, little cute sister.
Hello, darling, baby-pie, glamor- puss, sweetie--
 Beau!  You belong in bed!
He's home!  You're home!  You're all right!
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
Go ahead.
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
I was in it.
How!
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
Mom--I'm not--
And you wanted him to make a list!
Will you let him tell it!
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
Just relax, please relax!
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
Good Lord!
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
You're absolutely right!
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
You what?
No!
Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
I don't think so--
Well--
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
What's that got to do with it?
Why should you be the only one.
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
That's right!
Except yourself!
Will you wait a minute?
You don't want me to go.
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Just tell a little white lie?
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
I don't want to learn that!
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Do I have to spell it out?
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
Son--this is all happening so fast--
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something (stops as he sees the emptiness in them) Mom?
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
Dad?
Stop it!  You'll kill him!  Jim! Do you want to kill your father?
Let go of me--
You want a good crack in the mouth?
This place appeal to you or something?
What's he going to pull--
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
You see any cops?
 You monsters start home.  We're going to--
Yeah.  Yeah.
We're following you so better get there.
You see any cops?
No--
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
I think I should go home.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
 You clean out of your head?  Come on!
 W-O-J-T-what?
O-W-I-C-Z.  Wojtowicz.  What's the matter, man?  That's the craziest name in town!  It swings!
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
 Man, this cat never stops.  He just keeps going like Big Jay at a session! OFFICER Shut up.
He's writing a book about me--
What I could write about you they wouldn't print.
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.
What's the charge?
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Listen--
 He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
Come back tomorrow.
I'll wait for him.
Why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  Ever been booked before?
Who wants her?  Who?  Jim who? Never heard of you.
What do you want!
You know what we want.  We want your friend.
We got eyes for him.
Listen, you guys ought to go home. The cops are cruising every--
Where does he live?
You better tell us and I'm not kidding.
My old man's got a gun.
His old man's got a gun.  What do you think of that! (drives a hard blow at PLATO's belly) Your friend talked--  Now you talk!  Talk!
 What you doing!  What you doing to him!  You clear out of here 'fore I call the police!
Clear out.  Go on!  Go on now!
Let's go, Crunch.
Why you like to mix with bad boys like that?  Why you get in trouble all the--
I have to go out.  I have to warn him.
You not going anywhere!  You staying home while your mama's away.
John!  What you doing with that! You leave that be!  Put it down before you hurt yourself.  Hear me?
 John!  You stay home!  John!  John!
Coming up now another request--this time from the boys down at Anna's Pizza Paradise--A new arrangement of a great oldie in rhythm and blues.  Jim, this is dedicated to you--from Buzz.
They'll be looking for you.
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
It doesn't matter to them.
You were looking for me, weren't you?
 No--I was just--maybe--
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
Want some milk?
That's all I can do when I'm nervous.  Drink milk.  Here--have a slug.
You still pretty upset?
I'm numb.
You cold?
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
Neither can I.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
No.
Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What?  You still here?" Man!
Hey!  You smiled!
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Why?
I'm getting that way, too.
 Have you ever gone with anyone who--
Sure.  Lots of times.
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
 Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
Why did you do that?
I felt like it.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
Where you going?
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
I'm never going back.
Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium  Would you go with me?
You can trust me, Judy.
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
Frank?  I'm frightened.
What's that pounding?
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
He's home.  I heard the car.
Are you going down there?
Look--just relax, will you?
See?  It stopped.
I still think you should go down.
 Who's there?  Anyone there?
 Open it.
 Who's out there?
Where's your son?
What?
Where's your baby boy gone to, Daddy?  We want him.
Look in his room!
Jim!  Jim!
Son?
Is anything wrong?  I'm your neighbor.
Oh, no, thanks.  I just wanted to-- to be sure my garage was closed.
Is he there?
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
 Judy?
What are you doing?
Where's Jim?
I don't know.  Do you--do you know where he is?
No.  No, I don't.
I know where--
Hope I didn't bother you.  Goodnight.
Hey, come back here.  Who are you?
Jim!
Who's that!
It's me!
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
They're looking for you!--
Yeah?
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
We know.
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
Judy.
Help me in!
Hey where'd you go?
I'm here.  Shut up.
Come out come out wherever you are!
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
No.  I'm scared.
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
 Wow!  Well now-there-then!
Isn't it crazy?
Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
Oh, Jim!
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
 You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
Well--we're newlyweds.
There's just one thing.  What about--
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
See, we're very modern.
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Talk to them!  Heavens!
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
What?
There's only one key.
We'll take it!
Come on!
What time is it?
Hang loose.  We got all night.
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
You still want to go home, Moose?
No.
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
What guts?
 Quick!  Fill the pool!
Let's see how long we can stay under.
Man, you're schizoid!
 I'm what?  What?
You can't talk underwater!
 I bet you hear everything I say!
 Isn't he schizoid?
 Hey!  How 'bout that!
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
Not lately.
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
No.  Seriously.  What's your trouble?
I don't know but whatever it is, it's gone now.  I mean I'm happy now.  Here.
I came here before.
When was that?
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Who?
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
Plato, where's your father now?
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
It's all right.
Sure.
 You have a long life-line.
So have you.
Ever been in a place like this before?
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
How many rooms do you think there are?
I don't know.
Should we explore?
Hey!  Will you look at this room!  Judy?
 Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
Hi.
Hi.
 What?
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Why?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Are you?
 Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
You don't need to do that.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
 What a relief!
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
You disappointed?
 Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
What?
You smell like baby powder.
So do you.
I never felt so clean before.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
It is for me too.
I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
I mean it too.
What you stopping for?
You scam a car up there?
So what?
Nobody's lived in that hunk of junk for five-six years.
Well, what do you know!  I feel a kick coming on!
This is Unit 17.  Unit 17.
Come in, Unit 17.
We just zeroed three kids in a heap. Crest Drive and Observatory.  Looks like house-breaking.  Send us some help.  They may be armed.  Over.
Good morning.
Moose!  Take the steps!  Goon!  The other side.
Come on!  Let's make it!
Save me!
 What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
Plato!
 I don't want you for my father!
Your father!
 You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
 Get away from me!
Jim!
 Halt!
 Come here.
Plato!
Come here, son.
No!
Plato!
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
Plato!
Jim!  Watch out!
Take the house!  I'll head him off.
Halt!  Halt!
--located at Summit Drive--the Planetarium. RAY  The planetarium?  One kid inside-- five housebreaking in area.  Will proceed.  There are some kids in trouble-- you'll have to go with me.
Perfectly all right.
 Plato!
 Plato!
Did he hit you?
No!
We have to go back!
No!  I got to find him.
After he tried to shoot you?
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
He needed you, maybe.  So do I.
He needs you too.  Come on.
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
They're killing him!
Come out of there.
You're making it tough on yourself, kid.  Come out quietly now.  You didn't kill anybody yet.
 Need a little help here!
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
How'd he get in?
Smashed the front door.
Any other entrance?
 Down in back.
 Silence.  Please maintain silence. Keep back and stay off the pavements.  Keep back and stay off the pavements.  There will be emergency vehicles coming through. This warning is for your own protection.
What's going on?
I don't know, lady.  Some kid's in trouble.  Stand back, please.
I got to know.  My boy run off tonight.  He had a gun with him, too.
Hello, Ray--Know anything about this?
As much as you do--Loan me your mike, will you?
 Help yourself.
 I am addressing the boy in the planetarium.  I am speaking to the boy inside.  This is Ray Framek from the Juvenile Division--
 You are now surrounded.  You are surrounded by many armed police. Whoever you are, drop your weapon and come outside.
 Come outside.  Clasp your hands over your head and come outside quietly--
Frank!
Stay here.  That was my son!
You sure?
I think I know my son.
 Jim Stark!  I'm addressing Jim Stark.  Nobody will harm you or your friends if you follow these instructions.  We are here to protect you.  Drop your guns and come outside.  Nobody will hurt you if you do as I say--
Officers!  Another boy and girl just ran into the planetarium.  We do not know if they are armed. Hold your positions until further instruction.
 Ambulance.  Ambulance is coming through.  Clear a passage.  Will you people make way there?
 Plato?
 Plato?  Plato, you in there?  Hey, I'm going to open the door now. You'll be able to see me and you can shoot me if you want, but just remember one thing, Plato--You're my friend.  That means a lot to me.
Plato?
I'm here.
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
I've got a gun.
I know.  Light a match, will you?
That's swell.  How are you?
I'm fine.
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
No.  At dawn.
Why?
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
Here.
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
Hey, look at the stars, Plato. Stand up and look at the stars.
That's fine.
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
You sure?
Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
No.
I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
Can I keep it?
What do you think?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
My gun?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
I need it.
You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second.
You promised to give it back.
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
Why?
They like you.  Okay?
Come on!
Hi, Plato!
Hi.
Who's that?
Just a guard.
I shot at one of them.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
 Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
 Plato!  Don't be a fool!
It's Jim!
Plato!
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
 But I've got the bullets!  The gun was empty!
Plato?  Plato.  Hey, Jerkpot!
 What did you have to do that for?
Let him alone!  He's mine!  I'll take care of him!
It's all right!  It's all right!
For a minute...that jacket...I thought...  You couldn't help it, son. (reaches out, gently, but firmly) You did everything a man could do.
Stand up, Jim.  I'll stand up with you.  Let me try to be as strong as you want me to be.
He depended on me.
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
 This poor baby got nobody.  Just nobody.
 He was always cold.
Mom--Dad--this is my friend.  Her name is Judy.
