When did it start?
At 05:00. We're seven minutes in.
 Private Miller, we are now going to ask you several questions. How do you feel?
Uh, I feel a little queer sir. But... It's good. Good queer.  Sir. Good queer, Sir.
But...uh...even though I feel queer, Sir, I should mention that I'm also feeling quite gay...so, a little queer, but mostly gay.
Private Miller. When you think of your superiors, what emotions do you feel?
 This went out...Sir.
We will send someone in. Now answer the question.
 Private Miller? Answer the question.
Oh...um...what was the question again?
 What are your emotions towards your superiors?
COUGH   COUGH  Fucking shit.  Well, now that I think of it, it's strange that they are called my `superiors'. Does that make me their `inferior'? I mean, that's pretty fucked up.
 I've seen enough. Shut it down. Bury the hatch, sell the land, and dispose of him. This never happened.
 Hey! What the...what are you guys doing! Let go of me! (desperately looking at the mirror) Sir!!! Sir!!! Help me!!!
 This is General Brat. We've reached a final conclusion on Item 9.  Illegal.
looks out of place in his black suit as he drives he sits in his cluttered and worn old lady car. He smokes a joint while listening to talk radio.
Of course not! Who wants a pocket full of coins? Seriously. Weighs down your pants, clangs around. With all this unnecessary new security everywhere, we'll be setting off alarms left and right!
Um, I didn't order a pizza.
Excuse me, miss? Are you Sandra Danby
Uh...yea-
Sorry, miss, but you've failed to show up to your divorce proceedings 4 times under court order. You've been served.
Oh great! Thanks a lot asshole! Real clever! Go fuck yourself!
Fuckin' eh.
Nice! Hot Steppa!
 You think you know, chico/I know what Bo, don't know/touch them up and go - uh oh!/ Chi-chi-ching-chang!!!
Can I help you?
Just here to check out some units.
Come in.
Oh! Hey there. Are you here to fix the fax machines?
Nope.
You owe American Express $4068 dollars. Sorry, but you've been served.
Everything! They should be able to collect garbage TWICE a week. Why not? 
As a tax payer, can't I say that? Come get my garbage a bit more! Is that so f- ing crazy? I'm not asking for free beer Tuesday's or anything. And the whole city would be more aesthetically pleasing and smell better. And don't pretend you can't smell it. Ever been to New York? Great place, smells like piss, though. (takes a hit and starts coughing) Twice a week,  cough  might fix that.  Hold on one sec.
I need Dr. Terrence, immediately.
Of course. One moment.
 Hi there, I don't think we've met, I'm-
Dr. Edgar Terrence. You're the guy who repeatedly refused to take care of the monkey tree that spills onto your neighbors property. And now, because of that, you've been served.
Let me through, damnit.
My name's Corber.
You're Joshua Aaron Corber?
 Get out of town! Clarice did this, didn't she? I was just telling her before I left how I've never been in a limo. Can you believe it? 35 and I've never been in a limo. Man! It's not stretched, is it?
Sorry, but you've been served.
Ah fuck!  Fuck! You fucking asshole!!! FUCK!
 Hey! Nice. New chicken fries.
...3:09 in the PM and we-
Dale!
Mmm. Minty.
Hey Kyle.  So, should we head back to my place and finish up the trilogy? Matrix: Revolution. Whose it gonna be, Angie? Man or machine?
Of course. But can we just head to my locker first? I left some stuff by mistake.
Sure.
So, are you going to come over for dinner tomorrow, `cause my parents are beginning to think I made you up.
Well, yeah, I really want to meet them. Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow...let me think.
You don't have to feel weird about it. They know how old you are and they're fine with it. They just want to meet you and see that you're a cool guy and that I'm not dating you just because you're older.
Of course. I know that. It's just...tomorrow's tight. I've got a whole bunch of cases that I can finish tomorrow. It's probably going to take me into the night.
Fuck. Well, then you have to just come over sometime this week or something, okay? `Cause it's getting weird for them.
I will. I promise. I'm not trying to avoid this, for real, I've just been crazy busy.
Hello? Can I help you?
Pardon?
You can't just waltz in here and hit on the students. Get out now before I-
Mr. Edwards, he's my boyfriend.
This is your boyfriend? How old are you, 30?
And you're dating an 18 year old?
I'm 19. I moved here from Morocco.
Alright, well this school is for students and faculty only. Friends can't just stop by.
Dude, you may be a teacher here, but we're about the same age, so don't get all high and mighty. It's not that weird. Frankly, it's natural.
Well, in that case, get off school property or I'm calling the Police Liaison officer. Angie, no offense to you, but if this guy's dating someone your age, it's because nobody his age will date him.
Hey Angie. You were hilarious in drama today.
I'll wait in the car.
So, do you want to get some food?
No...actually I can't. I have to go serve a guy.
Now?
Yeah. It sucks. I'm sorry. We can hang out later though. You can come over.
We'll see if Neo is truly the one.
 Yo?
Yo. It's Dale. Mind if I come by and pick up some shit?
What's up, Saul.
 What the fuck?!?
What?
I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did you get in here?
Whoa...sorry, man. someone just let me in. I-
That's fucked up, man! This building is filled with fuckin' assholes. What else is the buzzer for? Fuck.
I'll buzz next time, man. I'm real sorry. I'm just not familiar with your, uh...protocol yet.
Hey, stuff your sorry's i n a sack, bro. We're always cool. It's those fuckin' jaggoffs.
Um...sure.
Brass tacs. I've got this new bud. Unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but fortunately, it's hands down the dopest fuckin' shit I ever smoked. And I've smoked some dope fuckin' shit.
Better than that Blue Oyster weed?
Dude. Seriously. It's like if that Blue Oyster shit and the Afghan Kush I got had a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest Northern Lights and that red-ass Espresso Snowflake had a baby, and then by some miracle those babies met, and fucked - then this would be the shit they'd birth.
Smell it.
What is this? It's spectacular.
It's called Pineapple Express. My guy Red told me it's when this Hawaiian flood takes special dirt to the weed or some shit. It's pretty scientific. And I'm the only guy in the whole city who has it. And, its only ten bones more for a quarter.
So...can I get a quarter?
No doubt. Just let me grab my scale.
What's with the look? What?
Where's the scale?
Oh shit! The scale. Be right back.
 You know what's weird? How sometimes, your brain just chooses to like, not keep things in it, you know?  Fucking scale.  Shit. Where is it?
Holy shit! What the fuck is this thing?
 Ah, the cross-joint. You've never seen one of these? Not surprising. They are, like, the apex of the vortex of joint engineering. NASA built the first one in the eighties.
You can actually smoke that contraption?
You light all three ends at the same time, then, you smoke it as it resonates the main section, creating a "trifecta" of smoking power. It's like, three times as powerful as a normal joint.
Well, be careful with that thing.
Dude...you wanna smoke this thing with me?
I can't even light it on my own.
 Wow. So like, uh...so like, so like what do I do?
Alright. Firstly you light these two ends. Then I will light the tip, making the trifecta complete. Are you ready?
Holy...
It's...uh, it's good to cough.  COUGH  It opens the  COUGH  capillaries...gets you twenty-five percent higher. 
And that, combined with the pineapple weed, and the cross-joint  COUGH  you're a good thirty to forty times higher. I don't know the exact math, but, pff, you're pretty fucking gong-showed. You know what I mean?
It's crazy. The better the weed, the more I wish I could think of how to explain what's so good about it, but the...uh, the better it is, the less shit I can think of in total, you know?
Okay, so, like, you've been buying from me for, like, a few months now and I really gotta ask.  What's with the suit?
I'm a process server.
You`re a servant? Like, a butler.
No, process server.
I'm hired to give people papers they don't want. It's pretty much the easiest job on earth.
Nice, man. Where'd you get that job?
Well...uh, I got a totally useless degree two years ago, then I did nothing for a year, then my dad got so fed up he hooked me up.
I got it pretty sweet, though. Today? I smoked like five joints, gave out some pieces of paper, and I ate some Burger King-
Hey man, did you get those new chicken fries?
Yeah man. I'd get on that shit. They're fucking mind blowing. So, then I hot- boxed my car and then...got some action from my girlfriend.
Does she smoke pot?
A little. She's in high school.
That's fuckin' sweet! Ilegal love! You're like Jerry Lee Lewis. I just read his biography.
No, no. She's 19.
 Oh. It's still cool I guess.
Yeah, it's awesome, although I think she's getting old enough where she's realizing I don't do much. And these high school guys these days. They're all roided out and going to Harvard. Even on my best days, I look like a fat, dumb piece of shit next to them.
Whatever, man. It sounds like you got it pretty good. I wish I had a job that easy. Fuck.
Dude...you've got, like, the actual easiest job in the world.
Hey! You're right, man. I never thought of it like that.
You can actually do whatever the hell you want. You get to sleep all day and people come buy weed at night.
That's totally true. Except tomorrow. Thanks to that bitch daylight savings, I gotta go change my grandma's clocks forward at 7am. Or 8am. I seriously can't figure it out.
Sorry to hear that.
Yo, so, like, what have these people done that you go after?
Let's see...tonight I'm going after-
Ted Jones. He forgot to pay his-
Dude! My guy, Red, gets his weed from a Ted Jones. He's, like, #1 supplier in town. Maybe it's him!
I doubt that, man. There's probably a lot of Ted Joneses's out there.
Yeah, but not like this one, man! He's what I want to be one day. He's like the "Jesus of Weed". So...I guess he's like Jah. Or Scarface.
Well Saul, that was crazy. Thanks.
No worries dude, peace.
Oh shit on me.
Pineapple Express.
Ha! Ha! Ha! Screech.
 Fucking hell.
Hello?
 ...me in! Let me in! Let me in!    Let me in! It's Dale! Let m--
 Denton? Dale Denton?
 ...the love of shit, let me in! Pleeea-
 ...fucking, don't smoke that shit if you can't handle it.
 Dude, whoa. What the fuck are-
He fucking killed him, man!
Be quiet, man, I got neighbors-
 He killed him!
 Somebody killed somebody?!?
Yeah, man! I can't believe it. A cop! A lady, and a guy.
Somebody killed a cop, a lady and a guy?
No! A guy!
A cop killed a guy?
No! A cop and a guy killed   another guy! The lady and the guy...No,   a fucking woman, a police woman, and   an old guy, shot a guy, a younger guy,   in the fucking window at Ted's house!
Was the guy Ted?
Which guy?
I don't know, the old guy who shot the guy?
I don't fucking know. He was this big, old, grey haired guy with a gun, and he fucking took him, and he shot him! Right there in the fucking window! BAM!
I heard Ted's got grey hair!
And they saw me! They saw me see them shoot the guy!
What!?! They saw you?!? Why the fuck did you come here? Did they follow you?!?
Did they follow you here!?!
No! I panicked. I was having a coughing fit, I crashed, I crashed into a car. Fuck, two cars. They must've heard at least. They knew someone was there.
But they don't know it's you?
No. I don't think so. No.
So...they're not coming here?
Cool. So, what's your game-plan? You gonna call the cops? Cause if you do, I'd appreciate it if you left my shit out of this shit.
I'm not calling the cops - one of them was a cop. They could all be cops!
Did you see any blood? Was it sick?
Yeah. I saw some blood.
I wonder who the guy he shot was?
I don't know, who do drug dealers kill? It was probably another drug dealer. He was Asian. Are there Asian drug dealers.
Hell yeah, man. The Koreans teamed up with, like, the Vietnamese or some shit. They're crazy mother fuckers. Number two in town.  Heh. Ted's cappin' the competition. Yo, you want some of this?
So, like, exactly what was the sequence of happenings?
I'm sitting across from Ted's smoking a massive joint of that weed you sold me-
Oh, the Pineapple Express. It's so rare it's almost a shame to smoke it, like killing a unicorn...with, like, a bomb.
When I threw it...out...the window...
What?
This weed is actually that rare?
 Yeah, it's like, "the rarest".
So, you are actually the only guy in town with this weed?
Fuckin' rights, I am. Red told me he was giving me an "exclusive sneak preview".
And am I the only guy you gave it to?
Yeah. So, we're the only guys.
But, like, another dealer, couldn't identify it, the pineapple weed? Like, if they found a roach of it, right?
I could. Why?
 We should go, we shouldn't be here! We should go!
No...seriously, why?
I left a roach of this weed in front of Ted's house!
So what? I leave roaches all over fucking town.
No, listen - they could find the roach and say, "This is pineapple weed, Saul's the only guy in town who has pineapple weed, therefore he must have witnessed the murder or know who did - let's go kill him."
Mother of fuck!
Let's go!
Wait!
Why!?! Let go of me! Let's get the fuck out of here!
Saul, wait! Grab anything we might need, like your weed and money and stuff.
Are you sure you're not forgetting anything?
Yes! Come on!
Fuck! I forgot something!
Dude, I was so scared going back, I thought there was gonna be guys there, and then you'd be gone, and there was this music in my head-
We'll take the stairs, it'll be faster.
Go back! Go back!
Okay, man. We gotta try to relax.
Why?!?
We don't want to draw attention.
 Whose attention!?! You think they could be down there? In the Lobby? Right now!?!
I don't know! Who knows? Just try to be cool.
Oh my god!!!                  Ahhh!!!
What the fuck was that?
That was bad - Calm! Calm! Calm!
Oh. Pardon.
Look.
Ted? He's gone, but he was just here. I think he knew we were coming.
Okay, what do you know about Ted?
What? Ted? Nothing. For all I know he's tracking us with space satellites right now! He's got grey hair, that's all I knew.
Let's go to your place.
No way! What if they did see my license plate!?!
Okay, so let's got to a hotel, or a motel, or a Holiday Inn.
Well, how much money do we have?
All I've got is the seventy-five you gave me.
That's it!?!
Well, how much money do you have?
Uh...nine bucks.
Well, shut up then! I've got more than you!
Fine. Forget the hotel.
I wish we could just go nowhere.
Okay...where's nowhere?
So what do we know? Nothing. We may or may not be followed because we don't even know if he found the roach or not. And, we could just be completely crazy. But, the question is this: even if he found the roach, how could he know where you were?
 He couldn't. Cause I'm in the woods. It's impossible! Unless he's, like, hanging on the bottom of the car or some shit, but I mean-
No, what I mean is, if Ted found the roach and identified the weed, how could he connect it to you?
There's no way. He could only find out from Red.
Who is this Red guy?
Red's pretty much a middleman between Ted and guys like me. And we're mad fucking tight. One time he convinced some girl he knew to give me a hand-job within, like, five minutes of me meeting her.
But let's say someone calls asking who he sold this pineapple weed to, he'll say you, because...why wouldn't he?
Fuck that. That's bullshit. He would have called me if that happened. A hand-job, Dale! Imagine if I'd gotten you a hand job by now!
Yeah, but Saul, he's a fucking drug dealer.
So? I'm a fuckin' drug dealer. What, you don't trust me then?
Um...I...call him. Yeah, sure, call him.
Thank you!
You're right. You are. I'm just being paranoid. Sorry, dude.
 Ow! Hello?
Yo, Red. You okay man?
Saul! Oh. I, uh...stubbed my toe.
Dude, watch the toes. Wear shoes in the house. But Red, I gotta get straight to brass tacs, I need a favor.
Sure man, anything. I'm Red.
You sure as fuck are, buddy. So, you know how you gave me some of that pineapple express stuff? Don't tell anyone you gave it to me.
Sure man, no problem. Red swears it, hombre.
So, can I come on over now?
 No! We should do it tomorrow!
 I'm in the middle of a convo, man. Let's just go and get this shit over with.
Come on, man. Tomorrow. I'm scared shitless. I want to think things through before I do anything. Let's go in the morning. Please.
Yeah...okay. Less scary shit happens in the day.
 Red?
 -I can hear him talking to someone, so- Yo! Saul? So, you're gonna come by in the morning?
Yeah, right after I see my grandma.
Sure, your Grandma's retirement home- Ow! Fuckin' stupid god-damn toe. I, uh, is that the one on Granville and 41st.
Yeah man. I've only got one. So, we'll be chillin' by noon.
Well, cool brother. Noon it is.
We should definitely hit up the casino again sometime.
For sure. We should definitely hit up the casino.
Nice. Now let's do some fucking stone cold chilling. I'll role a jigga, on the house.
Why isn't he coming now? What did you say?
 I didn't say shit, man! There was another guy there and he said tomorrow!
Why did he mention the casino? The Asians run the casinos. Is Saul Asian?
No, man!
This might be more than we thought.
Than you thought. I thought it would be more than you did. I'll call Ted.
I always liked smoking weed in the forest.
I'm going to go call Angie. Make up some bull shit.
Dale...wait!
Yeah, the phone...I mean, I don't know how this shit works, but...can cops... you said they might be cops...could they triangulate our phones or trace `em or some shit like that? I don't know. I feel like I've seen that.
I mean, shit Dale, maybe they can trace them when we're not even on them!
What the fuck is that?!
Are we on fucking "Lost"?! What the hell is that?!
It's them!!!
Holy fuck. That was close.
 You know what? You're right. We should just get rid of them. We should just smash `em.
Fuck. I just bought this thing. Maybe I can just take the batteries out?
No! Smash it!
Shit!
What the fuck was that?!
Fuck! I was trying to throw it at that tree!
What tree?
That one.
It was a cheap piece of shit. Came free with the plan. It must've smashed when it landed.
Who the fuck knows?!? I don't know!! Why couldn't you have just smashed it on a rock like a normal person?
I was trying to smash it! How often does a guy smash things? I'm rusty. Fuck.
Did you at least see where it landed?
Over there, somewhere. Wait! We could call it!
With what? I just smashed my phone!
Man, it's not like they got McGuyver workin' on the case. I bet they can't even triangulate it.
Well, then you shouldn't have said anything, cause now you've convinced me that they can!
Fine! Fine. Let's just find the stupid thing and get back to doing what we were doin'.
Do you see it?
Dude, this is the scariest place I've ever been in my life.
You ever see that movie where all the people are in the woods and they slowly get killed?
The "Blair Witch Project."
No...Shit. That one's way scarier than the one I was thinking of. Mine had Arnold Shwartzenegger in it. Now I'm thinking of the fucking Blair Witch.
 Stop!
 What-
 Sshh!
 What is-
 Sshh! Can you hear that?
 What?
 Just listen.
 I literally hear nothing.  Wait...
SAUL!!!
 ARGHHH!!!
Shit.
AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!
 Let me in! Let me in!
Let's go! Go!
Is there anyone even out there?!?
I don't know!
If you don't know then why the hell did you run like that?!?
I don't know! I'm freaking out, man! Let's just go!
No! We're not going anywhere!
But there could be something out there!
There's nothing out there, that's why we're here. God, man, you scared the fucking shit out of me.
Well, I'm not getting out of the car. I'm staying in the car.
-white accent walls would go nice with a dark colored room, say a burnt sienna, but don't forget...
Talk radio? You fuckin' joshin' me? Why don't we just shoot ourselves in the nuts?
Shut up, okay? It's my car.
Fine. Well, I'm going to smoke a joint before I go to sleep, and don't worry about it, even though you're being a dick, it's on the house.
Don't do me any fucking favors. I got my own.
Thanks to me!
Shut up.
Saul. Saul. Get up. Wake up.
Fuck me.
What's the time?
 It's too early.
It's...
This can't be right.
What does it say?
It says, uh...
It couldn't be three in the morning, could it?
It's three o'clock!?! We were supposed to be there at noon!
 Wait! My grandma's clocks! It's daylight savings!  Fuck! No! They go forwards an hour! Dammit-
It's four o'fucking clock?!
-I didn't go to my Grandma's! Fuck! And we've gotta call Red.
 How?
We'll find a pay pho...fuck! His number was in my phone!
You remember where he lives, right?
Yes, I remember. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Are you insinuating I'm forgetful? That's right, I know the word insinuating.
Let's just get out of here.
What the fuck? Come on.
 I think the battery's dead.
Are you fucking serious?
It's dead.
It's dead?
What the fuck happened? How did this happen?
How? We fell asleep!
Yeah. With your stupid talk radio. No surprise, that stuffs, like, made to put people to sleep.
We gotta...let's just...we'll walk. We'll walk to a road and hitchhike to Red's.
For real?
Yeah, "for real". We'll be late, but we'll get there. Then we can fix this insane situation.
Stop fucking around, man. Come on. Leave that thing alone.
It's like, my thumb is my cock!
 Thanks a fucking ton, Sharid.
So, what's this guy like?
I don't know. He's short...and stout. So he's like a tea pot. Hehe.
Well, do you think he'll be there?
I don't know, I mean, we are only...eight hours late.  That's actually pretty late.
 Who is it?
Red! It's Saul. Open up.
 Who's this guy?
Dale. Nice to meet you.
Dale who?
I think it's    better if you don't know my last-
 Dale Denton. He's with me. No worries.
 What happened to your clothes? Where'd you call me from, man?
We were in the forest laying low. Thinking.
Uh, Red...what...uh, is your lip okay?
Whoa! Dude, have you been crying?
What? Oh, I uh...  ...I got a cold sore, I've never got one before. I started crying.
A cold sore? Is that fucking herpes?
...uh, yeah, man.
Ewwww! That's sick, man. Do you know how many joints we've shared? I told you, man. This is from that time you ate the lollypop straight from the strippers sna-
Saul. Ask him.
 Okay, Captain Demando. Can you just chill out, maybe? So, Red. I gotta ask-
Okay, first of all, stop. What's this all about? That's what I want to know.
Alright. Well, Dale's a servant for protest lawyers, and-
Whoa, whoa! Saul, I don't think...well, Red, I don't mean to be rude but I don't think we should tell you any more than you need to know.
Fuck that, Dale. This is my house, I deserve to know.
Dude! Let's just tell him. It is his house.
Look. Red, I just don't want to pull you into the shit we're in. It's just trouble.
Don't be weird about this. If he wants trouble, it's his right to have it.
Whoa! Whoa! I don't want trouble.
That's why we only need to clarify one thing - nobody's called about Saul or the pineapple express or anything like that?
No one. Nada.
Awesome! Look at that! Everything's fine. We had a crazy night in the woods, which I assume we can both put behind us like grown ups, and now we can use Red's giant bong to get super-duper high.
Alright, well, wicked. Make yourselves at home. I'm just going to use the ol' telephone-o.
What the fuck!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Dale!   What the fuck are you doing?
 We can't let him call anyone! He's acting weird!
Fuck you man - this is my house!
I'm sorry. I just, I don't think I can-
Dale! You fucking nut. You're stoned and paranoid. Just chill the shit out, guy!  I'm sorry, Red. I shouldn't have brought this guy over here, he's a total lunatic.
 AAAHHH!
Holy cock!
Dude! He's sorry! Wait!
WHY!?!?!
Dude, we're friends, what the fuck is wrong with you? Ow! Dude! Are you fucked off that shit again!?! Ow!
I have to! They'll kill me!!! Please don't fight!
AAAHHHHHH!!!
Why, man!?! Why!
I'M SORRY!!!
He's going for the phone! Bathroom!
 SAUL!!! Phone!!!
What the fuck Red!?! What the fuck is going on!?!
I don't know!!! They're going to kill me!!!
You didn't stub your toe, did you?
Now tell us-
They're gonna come back and kill me!!!
DALE! HELP!
Red, you motherfucker.
It's happening! It's actually happening! He knows my name! Red knows my name!
We should beat it out of his sellout brains. You're a shitty friend, Red! Fuck the Casino! Go alone!
This is fucked, what do we do now, he knows my name!?!
He knows my name too!
Well what do we do? He's gonna tell them!
We're not gonna have to kill him, are we? I don't think I could do that.
Maybe we could talk him into killing himself, or, like, make him promise not to tell.
Well, we have to find out what he knows.
 I don't know anything...you broke my bong...
Tell us everything. Now!
Don't look at me, you sellout bastard. Now start talking!
I can't...I don't know anything.
What do we do? He's not gonna talk.
I think we beat it out of him.
For real?
Okay. Red. Here's the deal: if you don't tell us everything, we're going to beat you up.
Don't beat me up! Saul, dude, I'm Red!
You were Red. Now you're no one to me.
You've got five seconds, okay? Ready? Five, four-
Please don't.
Three, two...one!
That didn't hurt.
You didn't even hurt him! Hit him hard, man. Like, fucking hit him!
Wait! I...I...
No!
Ow! Fuck, man! Stop it. Listen...two...two guys came here, they...they were here when you called-
Seriously?
Who were they?
They work for Ted. Budlofsky and Matheson. Fuckin' crazy weird guys. They were here all day, but you guys didn't show. They said they'd kill me if I didn't bring you to them, they said I'd-
How many cops does he have in his...uh, payroll, or whatever?
I know there's this lady cop. He could have more, I don't know. He's got pretty crazy connections. He's also got a cool- ass hideout. It's crazy man.
Listen, I-
Who's his competition?
The Asians!
Asians? Which Asians? Indians are technically Asian.
The...the Koreans, I think. Everyone just calls them the Asians.
What else?
I swear to god that's all I know...I swear...
Alright. We should...tie him up and...and get the fuck out of here.
I made a gravity bong here once. I know where his duct tape is.
Come on, let's tape this piece of shit up.
I can't find the edge.
What?
I can't find the, oh...wait...
 Shit. They're actually here to kill him.
 What do we do?
 I don't know.
 Fuck. Oh, man.
 Guys, guys...listen to me-
 I'm fuckin' sorry. Okay? I fucked up. I'm a son-of-a-bitch. I forgot bros before hoes, even though these guys aren't hoes. You know what I mean. But I can fix this. 
I know these guys, it's cool. Just head out the back, I'll stall `em. Won't tell `em nothing. You can count on me!
Thanks, Red.
Dale Denton! It was Saul and some dude named Dale Denton! They just ran out the back!
In here!
No. I've got to get to a phone!
We should hide!
But, if Red tells Ted's guys my name, then they'll go to my apartment and find out about Angie!
I think we should stay!
Why?!
Because I'm in the dumpster already! Shit! Fine!
They're long gone.
Find out what he knows.
Red, you gonna tell us anything helpful?
I just did, Matheson. Fuckin' Dale Denton's the other guys name. He was with Saul, they kicked my ass. What more do you want?
You hear that?
Ask if either of them were Asian.
Hey. What skin color were these guys?
What? Um...white, they're both white. I think Denton might be a Jew, but I couldn't really tell.
You hear that, Ted?
Dale Denton. Not Asian. Alright. Kill Red.
 Oh fuck...you shot me, you motherfucker! Fuckin' Matheson...fuck you! You've eaten dinner here, man! Tacos! And now I'm gonna fuckin' die from this, probably. Get the fuck out of my house!
Fuck.
Carol, there's another name to run. Dale Denton.
Does he have something to do with our friend in there?
If the Asians have the balls to send an assassin right into my home, we can't be too cautious. The boys say Denton and Saul are Caucasian. Maybe after their assassin failed, they hired this outside guy Denton to finish the job.  Also, the boys said that Saul mentioned "going to the casino."
"Going to the casino"? I don't like that.
 I'll be back in an hour with everything there is on Dale Denton. He'll be dead by the time we make our pick-up tomorrow.
 But my parents live   in Canada. You don't think they're going   to go to Canada, do you? How would they   get a Canadian phone book even?
 All I know is Angie's new number is on my fridge and they could see that, so I have to get to her.
My Grandma lives here. They wouldn't go after her, would they? She's got a different last name. Belogus.
 " cough  It's Dale. I'm probably at work, maybe we'll talk later.  BEEP "
Budlofsky!
Dude, stay here. I'll be back in a minute.
Hells no! I don't want to be alone! I want to go with you!
Saul, just watch my back. I'll literally be five minutes. Please.
Fine. But hurry.
Angie!
It's Dale! You came.
Hi, Dale. Nice to meet you, sit down and have some couscous. Can I get you a drink?
What the hell happened to you?
Dale?   What happened to you?
Nothing, I was in the woods and...  ...Hi, I'm Dale. Uh...it's nice to finally meet you both...I apologize for my appearance. Robert, Charlotte-
 Shannon.
Yes! Shannon. I've heard a lot about both of you.
Very nice things.
You were in the woods?
 Alright, now, here's what's happened - I've been thrust into a kind of, ah...situation. So, uh, if we could all just start to evacuate...
...that'd be really, really good right now. I'll answer all your-
Is this a joke?
What is this Angie?
I think it is a joke.
 Listen. There are people after us and they could come here. I'll tell you anything you want, just please, let's go!
He's serious?
Yes, I'm serious. Super serious! We have to get the "F" out of here!
Get the hell out of my house.
Okay, Mr. Anderson, look, here's the deal - I saw a crooked cop kill a guy while I was working...this morning. The cop shot the guy then saw my car drive off, and I think they might have seen my license plate and, so, I ditched my car...in the woods, so...
No fucking way.
Who are these people? Why are they-
I think their drug dealers.
 Why?
Well, it's complicated. See, the...uh...it doesn't matter right now, we just have to get out of here.
Let's go to the police!
No, they are the police!
I'm getting my gun.
Robert! No!
We bought it for a reason!
 You... huff ...Angie? Dale! It's happening!
EEEHHHH!!!
ARGGG!!!
 Dale, it's one of the drug dealers!!!
No! I'm Dale's dealer, I'm S-
Angie! Stop! It's Saul!
What did you do, Angie?!
Ow!! Fuck. Now I'm gonna need a tetanus shot! They fuckin' kill. Fuck!
Saul? Dale, who is-
Dale, they're coming!
Fuck! What the hell?
Get out your fucking gun!
What the fuck is going on?
Stop! Stop! He's with me!
Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Holy fuck!
Dad, put the gun down!
Robert, what's going on?
Just nobody move, okay? Except Shannon and Angie. So, you two don't move!
Oh my god.
Sir, please, he's my friend, he's helping me, he's-
Stop shooting, man! I'm Dale's dealer
Guys! Please! We have to get out of here. Robert, Angie...Mrs. Anderson-
 It's Shannon.
I know! Look, we have to get out of here. I'm sure everything is going to be fine but better safe than...not.
Is this...for real-
Yes. Terribly real.
Ready?
No. One sec.
Hurry the fuck up.
Chill out, man. You're nagging isn't helping.
Ew! It's a bloody fork! What are these people doing?
Fuck. Look at that. Fuckin' mashed potatoes in my wound.
Baby! Get in the car quick. Angie, in the car!
Dale - get in the car!
 You stay the fuck away from my family!
Shut up dad!
 I...I think it would be best if I didn't go with you. I don't want to put you in any more danger.
What are you going to do? What should we do?
Angie, get in the car!
Alright, baby. Here's the plan - go to the Holiday Inn downtown and use a fake name. Something like... (looks around, focuses on Robert's car) Car...lyle.
Carlyle?  I...I have so many questions. I just...how can this be happening? Where...where are you going?
I have to stop this. I don't know how, but don't worry. I'll keep you safe.  But still, watch your back. You never know where they might be, whoever they are.
I love you.
Uh...thanks.
Um...you're welcome. And nice to meet you guys.
Why aren't we in that car?
Let's run, man! Run!
Huff   Huff  Where are we running?
Somewhere we can think.
A fork?
A bloody fork. In his girlfriends house. And the blood was fresh.
Maybe he killed her, to protect himself.
Or maybe it's the Asians fucking with us. What the fuck is going on!  Any luck with the cell phones?
They smashed one and left the other one in the woods to distract us. Took us an hour to find it. And we found Denton's car, which was filled with all these strange disguises. These guys are for real.
I want to talk to the Asians. Get me Cheung's number. Now.
 Hello?
Cheung. It's Ted.
 Record this conversation.
 Ted. This is surprising. What would you like?
Cheung, I want you to call off your man Denton. I don't know what he is, a scout, assassin, and frankly I don't care. I just want him gone. I want him dead. If you do this, I'll consider it a peace offering, otherwise, you're asking for war. And just in case you forgot, I'm number one, and there's a reason for that. You've got 24 hours to reply.
Ted Jones is slipping. Our assassin failed to kill him, but it did rattle his confidence. It's earlier than planned, but we should strike now, while he is confused. Let it be known-
-Li-Youngs death will not be in vain.
Victory joint complete. Here ya go.
"Tell us what you know!" How fuckin' balls was that?
Like, really balls.
And I think I fought pretty well, don't you? You know, for my first time. We were like Tango and Cash, man.
Or Scarface!
BOOM! Knocked the door right off it's hinges!
And you probably saved Angie, which is fucking pimp.
I probably couldn't have done it without you. Thanks, man. It is fucking pimp.
We're in this together, right? So, ya know.
Thanks, man.  You know, my last dealer was a total dick. You're by far the coolest dealer I've ever had.
 Wow. Thanks, man. I seriously appreciate that.
Yeah...like, the time before last time, I totally had weed. I just kind of wanted to chill with you.
 Really? That's awesome, man. That means a lot to me, `cause, like, plenty of dudes come in to buy and pretend to be all buddy-buddy with me, but in my head I'm always, like, "you don't like me, you like my drugs, so fuck you, buddy!" You know? And just so you know, I totally could have lit that cross-joint on my own. I'd just have to use candles, but, like, I've never smoked one of those with anyone before.
So, do you think we should leave town? We could just get on a bus and go, right?
We only have, like, fifty bucks. I don't think that could even pay for one ticket.
What about your sack?
Oh man. It's still fucking killing me.
 No dude, your sack of weed. Can't we sell some?
Of course. That's my bread and butter. We just have to go to a highschool. It's the easiest market. Chester A. Arthur is like, a block a way.
No way, man. I'm not going to sell to kids.
Why? They're gonna get it from somewhere. I mean, we got it from guys like us.
Well, then not kids at that school.
Well, there's a bunch of private ones nearby, but they're into way crazier shit than weed-
I can't do it, man. I'm not going to a high school is there anywhere else we could go?
 We could go to Crackhead Park.
What's that?
It's a park. Really close, actually. Full of crackheads. They smoke weed too, though.
Hey, stop it. Stop it. You wanna buy some weed, or, like, what?
See, that's the problem around here. Target demographic has a real, uh, fickle attention span. You gotta wow `em.  Hey! Who wants some weed!?!
Fuck this place.
Yo. `sup. You guys want some chronic?
 Man, this is great.
Cough   Cough  What's it called again?
Pineapple express. They said it, like, eight times, you fucking `tard.
Oh, so sorry if I-
Come on, man. Puff, puff, pass.
You know, I went here for a year. Kicked me out for having a swiss army knife. Everyone has a swiss army knife!
I got like, thirty for my Bar Mitzvah.
My Bar Mitzvah sucked.
I touched Jessica Lubell's tit at your Bar Mitzvah.
You touched a tit when you were twelve?
Lubell? Are you joking? Those are the finest tats in the grade!
Fuck that, dude. Angie in 12th grade has, like, the sweetest tits ever.
Hey!
What? You know her?
Yeah. She's my girlfriend.
Whoa. You're that dude. You lucky fucker.
 Yeah. She's pretty sweet.
And we're all high, that's hilarious.
Alright gentlemen, it's time for me to teach you some business. Brass tacs - this is the best weed you've ever smoked, agreed?
So I'm gonna make this simple. How much did you get between you?
A hundred and seventy eight.
Alright. You gimme all your money, you can each take two handfuls of weed. That treat ya right?
That's fucking awesome!
I know. Keep it on the down low.
 Jason'll never believe this...until I show him all this weed!
And we, my good man, are officially scott fuckin' free.
There are still people trying to kill us.
But at least now we can afford to run. I'm gonna go buy some celebration snacks. Let's have us a little mardi-gras fiesta.
Don't move!
Don't move! This stuff hurts. What's in your hand?
I'm sorry, Ma'am. It's weed. I'll get rid of it right away, I was just smoking this. I...I thought it was decriminalized. Or something. For medical purposes. I have epilepsy.
Selling pot to my students isn't "decriminalized." I'm the liaison officer for this school and I just caught four students showing off handfuls of marijuana to their friends. They told me they got it back here. Put your hands up.
Wait! I wasn't selling anything! All I have is this little joint.
You call this little?
I don't even have any money! How did I sell weed if I don't have any money?!? I was just smoking it. I swear. Please.
It's possible you're telling the truth. I'm going to run a check and if it turns out you don't have any priors and all you've got is this small amount of marijuana, I'll let you go with a fine. Take a seat.
They got Dale. Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck...
 Denton.
What is this for? What did that thing tell you? What did I do?
Hit and run, Mr. Denton. A double, actually. You hit two parked cars two nights ago.
The lady cop. She's gonna kill him.
You don't understand! You have to let me go! Dirty cops are gonna kill me! Please!
This...this lady cop, and these guys Budlofsky and Matheson, they all work for Ted Jones, and-
 Ted Jones?
Yeah. With grey-hair. Tell me you know what I'm talking about. He lives near Evergreen Heights. He-
Are you telling me you saw Ted Jones and a police office shoot someone?
Yeah. An Asian someone.
Stay calm, do as your told, I'll get you down to the station.
 Yes ma'am.
Oh my god! Is that blood? Oh my god!
NO! What are you doing!?!
Saving you. Hold on, amigo. Tango and Cash!
Freeze mister! Don't even...
No! She was going to help us!
 Oh...my balls...I seriously think I popped one...
 IT'S HER! The lady cop!
 Then who's that?
NOOOO!!!                      AAAAH!!!
The slurpee! I can't see!
Turn on the wipers!
Dude, I seriously can't see!
Kick out the window! Isn't that what they do?
I don't know. Okay.
Oh fuck! Shit!
Get it out of there!
Ah! Ah! My leg!
 She's following us! She's gaining on us!
Her car's better!
Ha! I can see! Through my leg hole!
Do something!
Hold on. I've got an idea.
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!?!?
Oh shit, man! I'm sorry! I thought she'd keep going.
Turn on the sirens!
JESUS!!!                         SHIT!
Run!
Saul! Saul! I'm locked in!
You dumb fucking fuck!!! HELP ME!!!
So... huff ... huff ...fuckin' sorry... huff ...forgot...
Don't touch me, you asshole!
Okay, only one way to do this, hard and fast. Bend over.
Ow! Ow! Hurry!
I am!
Which saw do you like most?
The brown ones nice, but the metallic ones seems more...
 Okay, I'm going to go call Angie. Be right back.
A thank you would be nice!
Could I have the, uh, Carlyle room, please?
Dale?
Angie! Thank god you're okay!
I'm fine. How are you? Are you okay?
I'm great. I'm fine. I miss you. So, here's the plan, babe. I'm going to leave town and contact a government official or something. From somewhere safe. I know this shit is all fucked up and I just can't apologize enough.
Dale. I've realized some problems and-
I know there's a problem! That's the thing, that's why I-
Dale, shut up and listen. People are trying to kill you, and me! Dale, drug dealers are trying to kill me, because of you! It's fucking over, man. Are you kidding me? For gods sake...
Angie, no! No! Don't you get it? I was thrown into this situation, I had no control, but I am dealing with it. This kind of thing happens, you know-
NO! IT DOESN"T!  You're immature, Dale! I'm six years younger and I'm saying this! And the fact that you think you're some kind of fucking genius just makes it a hundred times more infuriating!
What? You're telling me you think I'm a dumb guy?
You're not how you think you are Dale, and it's pathetic. Call me when I can go home.
Alrghit, I'll see you soon. And I'm sorry again about the clocks.  Ha! What a douche bag.  Yeah, love you too.
Yo, so before we go on the lamb I gotta go see my grandma, okay? She was worried `cause I didn't show up to help with the locks. But before that I've got to smoke another bowl.
Are you joking? You're actually gonna smoke marijuana?
Why not?
How can you smoke marijuana after what we just went through? That clearly happened because we were smoking marijuana.
No. It happened because those fucking kids didn't keep that shit on the down low. Which is weird, `cause they really seemed like cool kids.
If you haven't noticed, we're not very functional when we're stoned, Saul.
When I saved you with those Slurpees I was stoned. What do you gotta say to that? Maybe the pot is what gave me the creative capacity to come up with such a great plan! The Beatles were high!
You didn't save me! She was going to protect us, and now we're wanted for all sorts of crazy shit!
Fine. Smoke marijuana. But you know how "Scarface" ends. Face down, dead, in your own fuckin' water fountain.
For one thing, I'm done dealing pot. Mostly, because I don't know where I would get it now, but still. And "b", fuck you, man. You can't judge me. We're exactly the same, and this whole thing's your fucking fault. You're the one who dropped the roach!
It's not my fault!
It's marijuana's fault!
Stop calling it marijuana!
Grow up, you fucking two year old.
See! This is why you're a douche bag, Denton. Because you think you're better than others, but you're just a dumb pothead burnout, same as me.
Maybe I am a pothead burnout, but at least I'm not the dumbest most annoying guy in the world. The only reason I ever bought weed from you was because you're shit is so good, not because you're cool.
But you said you bought when you already had a few times, just to hang out?
Bullshit! I just like...liked having lots of different kinds of weed at once.
Here. Buy yourself a good last meal.
Super size it, bitch.
Saul! I'm sorry, man! I didn't mean all that! Saul!
Guy drove like a mother-fucker. It was amazing.
This is not good. We should have this under control. We haven't heard shit from the Asians. Got these lunatics after us. Shit.
We should probably get to the farm.
Solly?
Hey! Mrs. Mendelson!
HOLY SHIT!!!
Eat it!
OW! Shit...ow, ow, ow!
Solly Silver?!?
Mrs. Corber! You gotta hide me!
AHH!!! FUCK!!!
 NOOO!!!
Yeah!
Oh, god this is terrible. Poor Faye. Poor, poor Faye.
Hey, uh, what's going on here?
It just happened.
What did?
Faye Belogus' grandson was kidnapped from right inside the building. We all saw it. They fought in the majong room and hurt the new nurse, Stefan.
Uh...thanks.
If I was there, I would've kicked an ass.
Mrs. Belogus. I wouldn't worry, Saul's going to be fine.
ARRGGGHHH!!!
 Fuck. I regret everything.
Get up.
Oh fuck. That looks painful.
EEEHH!!!
Don't. Ted wants him.
Fine.
 El Dorado.
Dude, look at all this weed.
Shut the fuck up and keep moving.
What the hell is that?
Ow.
Hello? Anyone here? Red?
Oh my god.
 What? Who the fuck!
Stay the fuck back, Denton! I didn't do shit! I'll gut ya if I have to, tooled ya once, tool ya again!
 I...what? I'm not here to fight, man, I-
Good, man. I'm fuckin' tired.
I'm dyin', Denton. Fuckin' shot. Right here-  
I'm having a little going away party and I don't remember inviting you, cocksucker. So I'm gonna ask you to leave. In my dying moments, I don't want some asshole I barely know around.
Go to the hospital, man! Are you crazy. You don't have to die.
Yes I do! What? I go to the hospital, I'm gonna end up in But that doesn't matter `cause once Ted finds out, which he will, I'm dead wherever I am. I'm fucked through and through. Now if you'd be willing to give a dying man his wish, could ya run on into the other room and pop in disc two of Tu Pacs "All Eyez On Me". I want to listen to it while I die.
You don't have to die.
Will you stop saying that, I've excepted it, man. I'm at peace.  cough
Red, I need you to tell me where Ted's base is. He took Saul, and I can't bail on him. I'm going to get him back.
Fuckin eh, amigo.
Blaze of glory, motherfucker.
This is awesome! We're so gonna show those motherfuckers. Think they can kill me? Fuck no, you can't! Not how I roll.
What are you doing?
So, this is the backside of the farm. If you stay low in the grass you should be fine. If someone is shooting at you with an automatic weapon, zig zag. It makes you harder to hit.
You're not coming to help?
Fuck no! I've been shot. By these guys. I was in shock before, but the air on the drive cleared my mind, I should get to the hospital. You saw Reservoir Dogs, right? I got shot in the best spot possible. I could have a long and fruitful life ahead of me. Full of possibilities. Go get `em, slugger.
But how do I get out of here if I rescue Saul?
I've no idea. I'm sure it won't be that hard. Kill some dude and take his car, or just take it or whatever. Good luck, amigo!
I'll blow his fuckin' brains out if you don't-
Oh my god.
What the fuck was that, Budlofsky?
Haven't you seen "Speed"? "Shoot the hostage".
In the leg, you fucking moron!
Still worked.
Throw him in with the other guy, and everyone stay alert. Jared, go watch outside. This is fucked up. Somethings going down.
I think he's got a gun.
What?
You're kidding me, right? Die Hard?
I had to try.
Hey! He's got another one taped to his stomach!
And his leg!
Dale!?! What the fuck? Did you rat me out, you shitty bastard? That what happened?
No! I came here to save you!
To save me? Ha! That's rich! You're caught, too. And now I have to die with some asshole.
Saul, I deserved that, because I fucked you. You're right, this whole things my fault, and they only way I can make it up to you is by rescuing you, and that's why I'm here. To save my friend.
Tell ya what, Dale. You actually save me and I'll consider forgiving you for this mad shit.
Good. `Cause I will.
Oh really? What, you forget to tell me you shoot lasers out of your eyes, or you got some kind of secret blowtorch strapped to your dick? We're not gonna escape, Dale, we're losers, and sinners, and after we die, we're gonna go to hell!
We're not losers! We did that car chase. That was all you, man! You got away from the cops. I've watched, like, nine billion hours of worlds wildest police chases and I've never seen a guy get away. Not once! But you did it. You did the impossible.
We can hear you out there, and it's annoying. Shut the fuck up.
 Perfect! Now rub your wrists against my belt! My belt buckle'll cut the tape. Do it! This is it!
 Hurry!
 Yes! Yes! You know what this is called, Saul? This is called saving you.
You have them?
Got them downstairs.
Where did you find them?
We found Saul at his grandmother's and Dale Denton busted in here like a madman, armed to the teeth, and-
Yeah, he just plugged Frank and then I disarmed him. We got `em both holed up downstairs.
He shot Frank? Jesus. Fuckin' Frank.
Who the fuck is this Dale Denton?
Well, we'll torture these two bastards and find out everything they know. What about the shipment? Ready to move out?
We'll be good to in 10 minutes or so.
This isn't working. Turn around. I'm using my mouth.
 Someone's coming!
 Yo - if I cough, I'm going to make a move, if I cough twice, you take the lead. Got it?
 What? No! What if you actually cough?
Hey man, whatever you're doing, I get it, okay? So just stop it, alright? Just cut it-
AAAHHHHH!!!
Holy shit, man! I'm sorry!
AAAHHHHH!!! ARGH!!! YOU SHOT ME! I'VE NEVER BEEN SHOT! HELP! HELP! AAAAAHHHHH!!!
Has anyone seen my bigger knife?  Do you guys hear that?
Arg...
BUDLOFSKY!!!
Dale? You're alive!
What happened?
They got your ear.
 My what?
Here. Get up.
 AAHHHH!!! MY EAR!!!
YOU KILLED MY EAR!!!
 You shot me..
 Well, you kneed my balls!
You shot him?
Whoa.
Uh...stay there.
On three.
One, two, three!
You go down. I'll take care of this.
ARGGG!!!
Look at all this fucking weed, man. Where the hell are we? Is this some underground weed city we don't know about?
 What's that noise?
 I don't know! That guy just blew half my fucking ear off!
 There's some dudes in here. I saw them when I got dragged down. And there's some kind of super-suit or something.
Were they armed?
 I don't think so.
I can't hear them.
You could boost me up! We'll sneak out.
Shoot back!
Really?
YES!
Now run!
AH!!!                         WHOA!!!
Nice. You got him.
Lance? Holy fuck! You sons-of-
Holy shit. I killed him.
About time you killed somebody. You're the one whose supposed to be saving me, and I`ve killed two bad guys already.
You'll never be able to pull me up, but I'll boost you up there and you just fucking run for it, man.
What? No fucking way, Dale. What about you?
Don't worry about me.
Whoa. That was awesome.
You're a good man, Dale Denton.
Hold on!
Wha-
Denton!!!
AHHH!!!
Ew. Gross, man. A fuckin' dead guy.
Fuck...
 Oh god.
Where are you, you son-of-a-bitch?
Ha!
Fuck tha po-lice.
I'm a fucking cop, you moron.
AAAAAAARRRRGGGGGHHH!!!
You can't fucking take me. I'm young. Virile. Prime of my life. You're old. Old and dying.
I don't know who you are, Denton, or why you're trying to ruin my life, but you're fuckin' dead!
AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!              AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!
Crazy  huff   huff , psycho bitch...
Hey Saul!
I owe you one. In the gut. Then the balls, and then the-
 You just got killed by a Ford Fiesta motherfucker!!! How you like me now!?!
R...Red?
Saul! `sup! Dude, me and that Dale guy are rescuing you. And getting revenge on those whose shot us in the gut.
RED!!!
Oh no...
Oh yeah!
Now prepare to eat shit and die-
Sorry, Ted...
...but you've been served.
Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Aaaahhhh!!!
Ow. Ah. Ow. Okay... cough   cough
Saul!
Saul!  Cough   Cough  You're okay!
 Cough   Cough  What the fuck happened?
We... Cough ...we did it. We beat them. We won.
No fucking way. Seriously?  How did that happen?
I have absolutely no idea.
They were fighting Asian dudes, man.
Asian dudes? So, okay...maybe this is revenge for that Asian dude I saw Ted kill.
So we're, like, in a drug war. That's cool.
What's cool is that you came back for me man. You did, right? You weren't just captured again, were you?
Hell no! I was scott-free. But how the hell was I going to leave you there after you came to save me? Fuck that.
Motherfuckers. Motherfuckers. Light me on fire? Kill my Fiesta? Fuckers.
Red? You okay?
Fuck yeah, I'm fine. I'm Red. You're makin' me feel like a broken record. Now can we get the fuck out of this shit hole.
What should we do now? Can we go home?
I've gotta get downtown, try and win Angie back.
Tell her you cut off your ear for her, like that crazy artist.  But, seriously dude, your joking right? She'll never take you back, ever. Just grow up and date a woman your own age.
Do you think we should have looked for the ear? They probably could've re- attached it, eh? I mean, this ear thing kind of fucking sucks.
Oh my god, they blew your ear off, man! Fuck that's gross. Can you dudes switch sides? I don't want to look at it.
Don't worry, man. Look at Evander Holyfield, he looks totally normal. And plus, I saw this thing on the Discovery Channel, they can actually grow ears, like, in a petri dish, or even on the side of a mouse. And you only need half of one. It'll be a fuckin' cinch.
I just realized I've 100% lost my job by now. I haven't called in for days.
Who fuckin' cares? I thought you wanted to be a talk radio dude anyways? And, like, I never said anything, but you do have the voice. Like, when I didn't know what you did, I kind of thought you might have been doing cartoon voices, you know, like that Shrek shit, and that's why you wore a suit.
You do have a good talk radio voice. I love that shit, too. I...wait, say something again?
What? Why?
You're that dude whose always calling KSTAR about havin' two garbage days. I totally agree with you, man. I work out of my house, and it's, like, one of my main concerns, garbage pile up.
Saul, what're you going to do?
Work at a bong shop.
I'm still selling weed. Fuck you guys.
Do you hear something?
All I hear is ringing.
Dude, I'm kind of freakin' out. Like...I don't know...like, there might be someone out there. I mean...how do we know we got them all?
What the fuck are you guys talkin' about? I don't hear shit.
Well...the barn did collapse in a ball of fire, and we probably each inhaled about ten pounds of weed smoke, so...it's just, you know-
...a little paranoia.
 Stop!
 Are you guys fuckin' with me?
 What-
EMPTY_LINE
 What is-
 Sshh! Can you hear that?
 What?
 Oh fuck. I'm freakin' out.
 Just listen.
 I literally only hear ringing.
Fuck this noise!
I'm following him.
Wait! Me too!
