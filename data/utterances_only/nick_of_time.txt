Amtrack 2 64, the San Diegan, from San Diego, Del Mar...
...San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, and Irvine is now arriving at Gate Nine.
Amtrack 264 will be departing in fifteen minutes from Gate Nine for Oxnard, Ventura...
...Santa Barbara, Lompoc...
...Santa Maria, San Luis Obispo...
...and points north.
Look sharp.
That one.
Nah.  Hates his wife.
I hate rollerblades.
Lynn!  Lynn!!
Lynn, don't walk ahead of me, OK?
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
We made it.
We made it.
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
Keep your eyes peeled.
What about them?
Too old.
Him!
If you ever had an idea it would die of malnutrition. First those blue hairs then some Spic.  Leave this to me. I know people. It's my job. I'm a people person.
What the fuck are you looking for?
I'm looking for them.
Where?
Right there.
I gotta make a phone call, Lynn. Do you see a phone?
Come on, you.
 Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
On TV.
You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
 Hey, it's OK to talk about her. You can talk about her all you want. You know that, don't you?
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
No way.
How did you see us kiss?
That's it? That little peck of a kiss? Oh, brother, you missed some kisses.
Ooh, I'm gonna be late. I gotta call.
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
Young love.
 Foreigners! Fuck!
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
Hello, is Mr. Conners there? I have an interview with him at twelve- thirty. Hi, Mr. Conners, this is Gene Watson. Sorry to call you at the last minute like this but... Hey, hey!
Watch that! Lynn, come here!
Sorry. There's some crazy kids on skates. Listen, the train just got in, I'm afraid I'm going to be a few minutes late.
Great. OK, I'll get there as soon as I can. Bye, now.
 Ready?
Nods.
Let' s do it.
Whoops.
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Right.
Perfect.
 Perfect.
Could I see some identification, sir?
What?
 I.D. Could we see some?
Uh, sure. What's, what's the problem? Will a driver's license do?
That'll do just fine.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Yes.
Where's that?
Near Lompoc, north. What's...
Come with us, sir.
I'd like to know what...
Don't cause a ruckus, sir.
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
Come with me, honey.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
You stole that.
No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
What is going on?
Into the van, Mr. Watson. Front seat.
Let's get your seatbelt on. Always gotta wear your seatbelt, isn't that right?
I want my daddy.
There's your daddy. See? We're your daddy's friends.
That's right. The policeman is your friend. Isn't that right, Daddy?
Daddy?
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
Everybody does?
Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out.
This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack!
Laughs.
It goes in that little hole.
Let me do it.
 It's loud!
Removes a Pro Label Machine from under the seat. She begins to type in several characters.
Let's get down to business.
Who are you? You're not the police.
Brilliant.
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
You wouldn't...
Try us.
Get your hands off her.
Mr. Watson, you're not paying attention. Your daughter's life depends on you. Do you understand that?
Yes, yes, I understand.
Good.
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
Yes, I'm listening.
She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.
When you leave this van you will get yourself a cab and take it to the Bonaventure Hotel. Then you will take this.
...and you will kill the woman whose picture is in there. Not just shoot her, mind,! kill her. I'd recommend you empty the gun into her. Close up. Got all that?
You're out of your mind.
What's your point?
I will do no such thing.
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
Don't worry. We'll take good care of the kid.
It is now 12:16. If the woman in the picture is alive at 1:30... (holds up a walkie- talkie) ...I call my partner, your daughter is dead.
And what happens if I don't call you?
I kill her anyway.
Did you hear that, Mr. Watson? Do you understand?
The woman in the picture...
...or your daughter.
Oh, my God...
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
Only you.
You're wasting time.
Where is my daddy going?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
Just like Power Rangers.
Let's test this thing. You on?
 Reading you.
You'11 need some cash.  I'll hang onto this for the time being. Oh, and...
You'll need these.
Get moving, Mr. Watson. Time's a wastin'.
Mama!
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
 Go ahead, sugar Die.
 Lynn calling Daddy. Lynn calling Daddy. Come in, Daddy.
Lynn!
 I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
That's enough.
 'Daddy has to go now.
 He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
Over and out.
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
 At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Unless you do what you're told. Go do it!
And don't forget I'll be watching you.
Where to, sir?
The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
Amtrack?
What?
You just come in on Amtrack?
Uh, yes..
Business or pleasure?
Business.
Where'd you come from?
San Diego.
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
Sorry.
'S okay. What do you think?
Huh?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
Aw, too bad.
Somebody close?
What?
The grave. Somebody close?
Wife. Ex-wife. Almost ex. We were separated. She was thinking about a divorce.
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
Oh, yeah?
Jesus! Watch it, buddy!
I'd love to hear about your problem, but the ride's over. Three-fifty.
Three-fifty. I hope your problem doesn't have anything to do with my three-fifty.
Right. Right.
What do I want with an accountant?
I got one for the airport. You free?
You bet.
Oh, my God. Oh, no.
Oh, shit.
Oh, sweet Jesus...
Could you tell me where the Emerald Bay Room is?
Third floor. Yellow stairwell. Follow the signs.
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
No problem.
 Whoops!
Nice body check.
You know my wife has a deeply personal reason for going after repeat drunk drivers. They are felons and they should be treated as such. A drivers license is a privilege, not a right.
Excuse me, is the...thing over?
Yes. You didn't miss much. The food...chicken again.
Eleanor Grant is gone?
Yes. Nice speech. But it's the same at all these...
Check your itinerary. Move along.
This says "invitation only".
Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
They-didn't hear a word I said. The mike was too low on the podium.
How much did we pay for that room?
We didn't.
Somebody did.
A Have Nolin pre-check the PA systems.
Excuse me, sir, this car is for the Governor. You can take the next one.
Don't you dare, Franco. This is one of our biggest supporters.
Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial incumbent. That's a mouthful isn't- it? I love saying that.
Whose idea was it to have a lunch right after the brunch? I'm about to bust as it is.
We'll just walk through, do a little grip-and-grin, then get ready for the press con.
Governor...
I need your help.
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
Its'...ah...about my daughter....
Room for one more?
I think we can accommodate you.
Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial incumbent.
A pleasure to meet you, Governor.
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
I...
Yes?
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
I've got the pen if you've got the paper.
How about that?
Is that something precious?
No, that's,..that's fine
What's her name?
Her name? Her name is Lynn.
It's funny. I don't even keep a pad of paper with me anymore, everything's gone so electronic.
If it wasn't for double A batteries I'd be in big trouble.
Are you all right? Elevators make me queasy, too.
She was right in front of you! What's wrong with you!?
Are you 'fucking with me!?
The gun...
What about the gun?
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
You...
You won't get many chances like that, Mr. Watson. That's the way life works. Don't blow the next one.
That's pretty good.
I've done much better ones than this.
You have, huh?
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
That's good.  That's good, sweetie pie.
There, all loaded. Ready for the hunt.
Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they...?
 You don't see your face, you don't pay!
Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they say? What you need is a shoe shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.
Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a load off. Put the world in perspective.
So, are you a visitor or lucky enough to live in The City of Angels?
I'm...I'm visiting.
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
 I'm just an accountant.
Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?
Now you take tips. Time was a tip was between a man and his customer. Not any more. They've figured out what they call a formulae, don't laugh, it ain't for babies. They take your sales, see, and slap a percentile on there, figuring that somewhere between your lies and your bad luck they'll hit on the mean amount, mean meaning "in the middle", but if you ask me it means "just plain mean". Why you can have Uncle Scrooge wring a nickel over your poor out-stretched palm, or Daddy Warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins like manna from heaven, don't make no difference, they'll tax your behind according to that same figure. Doesn't seem quite right., does it?
No. No, it doesn't.
Hey, Huey, how's it hangin'?
It's a load, my friend, but somebody's got to carry it.
I have to do something.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
I said I have to do something.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Is within himself.
Drove me crazy. There must have been one on me. I didn't add up so she left. That's what attracted me to her In the first place. She made up her mind and she did it. She wouldn't sit around waiting for...whatever. She'd do something. She'd do something.
Yes, well, you know, for a quality shoe you can't beat a good wingtip. Wears like iron. You're a wise man. There ya' go. Two bucks.
You got anything smaller?
Keep it.
It's a twenty.
Keep it.
Well...thanks muchly...
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
Thanks.
You get another chance in ten minutes.
Then I have time for a drink.
All right, Mr. Watson, but make it just one. I don't want you...
So where was I?
I don't know. Something about the Governor's new regime.
Oh yeah. She's dumping the Good Old Boys like yesterday's newspapers.
The white boys are in for it. When they got her elected they never thought she was gonna make the Governor's office look like the United Nations.
We're talking Custer's Last Stand here. The only minorities not on her staff are the ones still lost in the Rain Forest.
 Lynn!
Shhh. You'll wake the baby up.
 What we have here is what they call a Mexican standoff. The thing you gotta ask yourself is, "What's behind the seat?"  Now, a twenty-two'd go right through it, but even a button will throw a twenty-two off so there's a good chance it'd get screwed up somewhere along the way, miss the target. Maybe a thirty-eight?  A thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight, unless it hits metal, then it'll bust up in little bitty pieces. They'll keep going but they'll be slowed down quite a bit. How's about a three-fifty-seven?  It'll go through the seat, her, you, the dashboard, shit, it'll go through the engine block before it knows it's hit anything, end up in some pedestrian three blocks away. What do you think? What's my poison?
Well it's a comfort to know you've got the co-Jones to pull that thing out. Whether you've got the balls to pull the trigger we've still got to see.
 He's coming back in.
 I've got him in the crosshairs.
Pool Deck?
Fourth Floor. Take that escalator.
My wife is not interested in negative campaigning. She wants to accentuate the positive. I don't know about you but I find that refreshing.
Have you ever thought of running for office yourself?
 Me?
I'm just a business man.
I know what you're thinking.
What would you do in my place?
Me?
The bitch would be dead. Course I ain't sayin' which bitch.
There's a plot to kill the Governor. If you don't believe me, check that guy right there. He has a gun.
So do you, Mr. Watson.
You got this under control?
Yeah.
It doesn't look like it.
It's under control.
It better be.
I oughta throw you after that walkie- talkie but I'm going to give you a break because you're an amateur.
Gentlemen...
Yeah, thanks. Have a cracker.
Have a cracker, Mr. Watson.
There was this guy. Big guy. Irish- Italian. Red-faced, black-haired, jolly son-of-a-bitch.
Nobody could make me laugh like him. We closed more bars together than I can count. He was my pal. I loved that crazy mick, I'm not ashamed to say it. But he was fuck-up. He had this image of himself. Thought he was con man. Always trying to shave the edge. Nickel and dime. I'll always miss him. Tell me why.
What...?
Tell me why I miss him.
He's dead?
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
How should I...?
Tell me why he's dead.
You killed him.
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
I loved that motherfucker but I got the call and I put him down like a sick animal. So if you've got any doubts about what's going to happen if you don't deliver let me tell you something. I'd make gravy out of your little girl just to season that black Irish cocksucker's meat.
Do what you're supposed to do. Do it now.
Shit!
It is my extreme pleasure this afternoon to introduce to you...
...a woman who can only be characterized as a one-of-a-kind.
Feeling better?
An iconoclast with class...
The elevator. You weren't feeling well.
A genuine lady who's not afraid to get into the trenches...
Are you better now?
...and go to the mat with greedy special interests...
The finest Governor our state has ever had...
My friend and yours, Governor Eleanor Grant!
My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
Sure, sure, I'll help you. Let me get Mr. White. I'm sure he can assist you, he's our...
 No! You have to listen to me.
I'm listening, I'm listening.
My friends, my good friends...
Please...please...you have to believe me... They have my daughter.  They want me to kill Eleanor Grant  or they'll kill my daughter.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
I don't know. One of them is following me. If he knew what I'd just told you they'd...
Look, how did I get in here with this!?
I don't know.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
You're right, it is.  Here.
Will you trust me now?
I guess I'll have to. Come on, there's one person we can go to.
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
...I remember that horrible night as if it were yesterday. A phone call pulling me out of sleep, the terrible news...
My husband and child senselessly killed by a drunk driver.
We've got about ten minutes.
Are you sure?
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
But...
Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
Okay...
Hey.
I think you better put that away.
I think you're right.
But tragedy, if it doesn't destroy us, has a curious way of giving us strength.
I doubt if I would be before you now, if I hadn't been put through that crucible of loss.
And though I can never forget William and Bill Junior or the love I felt for them...
I have found joy again in serving this great state. I have found love again in my second husband Brendan...
Where are we going?
Ms. Brooks ...
Is he in?
Yes, ma'am.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
What is it? Is there a problem?
We need to see you, Brendan.
 We have to hurry.
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
What? What are you talking about?
We need people we can "trust. We only have a few moments...
This is...this is insane. How do you know this?
I know it because I'm the one who's supposed to kill her.
You are!?  You brought this man here!? You brought this man to my room!?
I had to. Her Security people may be involved...
Is there a problem, Brendan?
There certainly is. This man says he's been hired to kill Eleanor.
Not hired. They're blackmailing me.
Who is this "they"?
I don't...I don't know. Please, Mr. Grant! They have my daughter. I'm not some lunatic. Your wife is in trouble.  Someone is trying to kill her. Someone is trying to make me kill her. Please, listen...
And on the strength of this story, you bring this man to Brendan's suite? Does that show good judgment, Ms. Brooks?  I'm just a friend of Brendan's, but it seems to me...
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
 What?
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
I see. Where is this gun?
Have it.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Could I see it?
My goodness. It certainly looks real.
What's your opinion? You're the expert in these matters, supposedly.
Jesus Christ!
 Yeah, I'd say it's real.
Are you out of your fucking mind!?
Somebody mind telling me...  What the hell happened!?
Help me get her off the rug.
What have you done to me!? Christ almighty!
No!
You fucked up.
That's enough.
You want me to kill your kid!? You want me to kill you!?
Don't let him go!
I killed you.
You fucked up.
You nearly killed him, too, you idiot!
Nearly doesn't count.
I'm on record. I never wanted this. I wanted simplicity; a telescopic sight, a powerful rifle, but no. What was good enough for Oswald wasn't good enough for you two. You had to get fancy. Drag some shmuck in off the street, stick a gun in his hand.
It's academic now. She had to be killed.
What were you going to do, Brendan? Lock her in a closet?  You're in the fucking kitchen now. Get used to the heat. He's been seen all over the hotel, looking like some Loony Tunes. We even got him on video. It'll work. Don't worry about it.
Is he awake?
Yeah.
Oh Great. Why don't we just give him our home phone numbers while we're at it?
It doesn't matter what he hears.
That's what it looks like. She was alive a minute ago. Now she's dead. Because you wouldn't do what I told you to do.
Get going. You've only got a few minutes to pull it together.
It's too late for that.
There is a dead woman on my bathroom floor!
What about it? She's Eleanor's assistant and they will have been shot with the same gun, by the same lunatic.  Some, anonymous loser who went over the edge.
 Only thing better would be if he were a postal worker.
He won't be doing any work once I get through with him.
And in a few months you're in the Governor's mansion. The people'd make you king of California if they could.
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
I kill her - and you kill me.
Keep your voice down.
Even if you don't, Her Security men will.
How am I supposed to get away?
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
 Come back.
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
 Come Back....Fucking Radio.
I told you she'd be alright, if you do your job.
And I'm supposed to trust you?
What choice do you have?
After you.
Look out there! You see the van?
You see it?!
Come back.
 Yeah.
Do it!
 Daddy...?
Lynn!
Security. Take the next car.
Again.
 No, please...
You got one last chance. Half an hour and that kid is dead. I'll kill her myself. I'll rip her fucking head off right in front of you!
 Daddy, did you hear me scream?
She told me to scream as loud as I could. Did you hear me?
The next time I tell you to do something, you goddamn well do it!
Hey, fuck you! You want to baby-sit a screaming kid in traffic, come out here and do it yourself. He got the message, didn't he?
Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they say? What you need is a shoe shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today.
 Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a load off. Put the world in perspective.
So, are you a visitor or are you lucky enough to...
 You got a complaint?
You remember me?
I remember. The big tipper.
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
Oh, man...
Please. Something is going to happen...
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
Please...
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
Come on, let's get some privacy.
He's deaf.
He can't hear a word we're saying.
You wouldn't be kidding me now, would you, Mr. Watson?  Hey, nigger! Is that right? You can't hear me? Nigger?
Why, looky-here. My customer-quotient just got multiplied by two. What do you think of that?  You'll have to forgive me, sir. Didn't hear your approach. Fact of the matter is, I'm deef as a post. Compliments of the United States Army...  ...Artillery Corps. Can I give you a shine, sir? You don't see your face, you don't pay.
 Yeah, sure, give me a shine...  ...shine.
I'm putting your toy back in your pocket, Mr. Watson.
It's all wound up. Now let's get out your itinerary.
One thirty. California Ballroom.
 That's right. That gives you...
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
Let me talk to her again.
No.
I want'to talk to her.
Forget about it.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
Don't you threaten me.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
You know what I'm gonna do.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
It would be a lot less trouble just to let me talk to her.
 Come Back.
 Yeah.
Put her on.
What gives?
Just put her on.
 Daddy?
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
 I'm tired. I want to.go now.
I know you do, honey.
Can we go now?
 Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
To be a hero?
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
 All right.
He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
That's enough.
Will you promise me that?
 I promise.
All right. Kisses to you.
 No...kisses to you.
No. Kisses to you.
 No, kisses to...
I don't care who the fuck you do it for just so you do it. Hey.
You done yet?
Just about.
Two dollars, if it pleases you.
It doesn't. I remember when it was a fuckin' quarter.
Twenty-five minutes.
Thanks for the tip.
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
Cover your mouth.
What?
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
That's right.
Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
That was your kid on the walkie- talkie?
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
What are you supposed to do?
Kill the Governor.
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
Who?
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
Oh, Jesus ...
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
Then why'd you drag me into it?
 It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
Yeah, all right, listen...
 So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it....
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
What are you going to do?
I haven't the faintest idea. Go on now. I'll get word to you.
If nothing else, someone heard my story.
Keep the change.
Don't think I won't.
I need a drink.
Give me a ...a gingerale?
No shit. If I hear that stop the violence routine one more time I'm going to shoot somebody.
Here's your Ginger Ale, sir.
They're all the same.
You know what bothers me?
When they get all weepy eyed about the "ordinary citizen", the "regular Joe", the "normal American". Gimme a break. There ain't no such animal. We're a nation of two hundred forty million special interest groups.
Well, I'm just a regular guy.
Is that right?
Yeah, that's right. But I've built a good solid business out of nothing. Don't underestimate the regular guy.
Sir, you haven't paid.
It's on the Special Interest at the end of the bar.
Hey, Sir, don't make me call a cop.
Laughs.
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Shut up.
 Let's all hope so.
Quick, off with the shoes and pants. Trade with Gustino. The big guy's coming.
C'mon, ladies. No time to be shy.
Gustino! Drop 'em!
And cover up them socks. Man, who dresses you?
Fue.
Meet Irene.
Hi.
Irene is going to help.
Thank you.
Where am I going?
You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
Yeah.
You're going to go see her.
What!?
You sure she's asleep?
I took up extra pillows. She take a nap before her big speech.
What am I supposed to say to her?
It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
 Irene...?
 Excuse me...
Who the hell are you?
No, please.
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
My security people are right next door.
I appreciate that.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
That's...a comfort to hear.
I have a problem.
Ah.
Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
I remember you...in the elevator.
That's right.
You were very nervous.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
I need you to listen to me. Carefully. Three lives depend on you listening very carefully to what I have to say.
 Of course. But suppose we set up an appointment. I have an important speech to deliver and you're cutting into my nap time.
Krista Brooks is dead.
How do you know that?
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
You shot her?
No.
Who did?
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
What?
And your husband works for somebody else.
What the hell are you saying?
He's gone.
Hey, Gustino, what takes you so long? You need to eat more fiber.
You got anything to read?
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
I don't blame you. I don't have any proof. But nothing like this occurs in a vacuum. You can't be totally oblivious. You must suspect something. You're doing things which are making people angry. People who have been in power a long time are losing their jobs. You know them better than me. How much does it mean to them?  How far would they go to hang onto it?
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
 I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
This? I've never even fired one.
Indeed.
 Franco! Franco.'
What is it, Governor!? What's wrong!?
I...I'm afraid I've had a bad dream, Franco.
Well?
I don't know.
What are you going to do now?
I don't know. I have to get back.
What are you going to do!?
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
 Where is he?
In the john.
Get moving.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
It's time. It's time now.
Where are we going?
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
Out of there, Mr. Watson! Your time's up!
You forgot to wash your hands.
I've got faith in you, Mr. Watson. I know you're not just a regular guy, see, I know that. Even if you don't know it yourself. Maybe that's why I picked you.
I know what I have to do. I'll do it. Let's go.
Hey, El, how's the head?
Eleanor.
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
It's an important speech.
I'd say critical, not that it's any of my business.
It's just another speech in a Tower of Babel so high that Nimrod himself would be put to shame. Cancel. Make my apologies.
Excuse me.
I'll trot along. Nice to see you, Eleanor.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
What's he doing here?
Who, him? Just visiting.
He's my friend. And he did help you to get elected, after all.
Don't remind me.
 What happened here?
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
Eleanor, please. I'll put it this way. This speech or a half-dozen rubber chicken-fund raisers. What do you say?
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
All right, I'll do it.
That's my girl.
But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
 I've been a bad boy.
Ladies, gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to introduce to you the esteemed spouse of our Governor. Let's give a big L.A. welcome to Mr. Brendan Grant.
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, campaign volunteers, and those of you who were looking for any excuse to take off work for the afternoon...
We have with us today the first woman Governor of our great state...
Governor Eleanor Samara Grant. What can I say about her....that won't get me in trouble when I get home tonight.
She's a woman who loves our great state.
A brilliant legislator.
...who will soon win her second term as the greatest Governor California has ever seen!
Ladies and gentlemen...
I am honored to present to you our esteemed Governor and my beloved wife, Eleanor Samara Grant!
Thank you! Thank you all!
Look out! Look out!
Look out!
My God, he did it!
You little son of a bitch.
Are you all right, Franco?
 I'd be better if they'd put sleeves on these damn vests.
 It's time....You read me?  I don't hear from you I'm going ahead now.
Why do you keep looking at me?
That's my job. I'm your babysitter.
I'm not a baby.
You're a big girl, huh?
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
Close your eyes.
Why?
I've got something for you.
A surprise?
You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
Good afternoon, madam. Hello there, little girl.
Hey, hey, what are you doing!?
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
Fuckin' A.
I don't think so.
Hey!
I think this is worth a dollar.
Goddamnit! Gimme that!
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
Gimme a dollar.
Fuck you!
Gimme that thing!
Goddammit, give it to me, you Sunnavabitch!
Daddy blew it.
Very good...Mr. Watson. I told them...I could make a killer out of you.
There's nothing like a good wing- tip.
What time is it?
Lost my watch.
Any comment at this time would be most premature. Please, we'll have something for you in a couple of hours. Please...
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
I would also like to apologize.
For what?
For not believing you.
Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.
You have a very brave father, Lynn.
He's a hero.
Yes, yes he is.
Dads are like that.
Can we go now?
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?
Good luck.
Same to you.
Thanks for the shine.
Thanks for the tip.
 Come on, kid. I gotta make a phone call.
Kisses to you.
No, kisses to you!
No, kisses to you.
