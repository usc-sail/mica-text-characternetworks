-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo.
 Is that Bandit in the lead?
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.
 But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
That's the point, Dickey.
Oh.
Now, you just find him, son.
Yes, sir.
Say, hoss. Where might I locate the Bandit?
Ain't seen him.
 Over there behind his rig.
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
 Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
 What's he get if he wins here?
 If...?
Five thou.
Chickenshit money.
 Could you turn your head?
Look, Kyle; I ain't in this Truck Roadeo for the money. It's the challenge. You know, the ecstasy of victory, the agony of defeat.
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
 See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
You know how rumors start.
I think you're just yellow.
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
 Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
 Last year, this was a new rig.
But it wasn't a Kenworth.
 Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
 Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
He's thirsty.
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
How much style?
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
 You paying for the gas?
Whaddya mean, we're not going to the show tonight?
 Hot Pants, I got no choice. I gotta make a run to Texarkana. Over.
 But you been promising to take me for three weeks.
 Baby, I...
 Break. Break.
 Yeah, breaker; come on.
 Hot Pants, this here is Sugar Man. I'll take you to the show tonight. Pick you up at seven. How am I hitting you?
 Bull's-eye, Sugar Man. Bandit?
 Yeah?
 Go sit on a cold carrot.
 Goddamn, Waynette; you sure do look foxy today. If you weren't already married, I'd...
Don't give me that horseshit, Bandit. You ain't seeing him.
 Yes, I am.
 No, you ain't.
Hi, Uncle Bandit.
 He ain't your damn uncle and get that mutt outta here. He just peed all over my hot curlers!
 Cledus.
 No.
 Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
 Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
 How'd you know?
Look, all we gotta do is make a run to Texarkana...  ...in twenty-eight hours.
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
 That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Or in the slammer.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
 Waynette!
 This ain't fair. You're letting him talk you into this.
 I swear to God, pumpkin; I'll be back before you know it.  And then I'll make you glad you was born a woman.
Well, I just might not be waiting this time.
Honey, please... Don't be this way. You know I'd do anything for you.
Anything?
Take Fred.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
All right, Fred; enough fun.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
 Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
No.
See.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
 And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
 How long's this gonna take?
I don't know, man. Ask him?
 We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Also boring.
But I still don't think...
What are you doin' now?
 Running blocker.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Go.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
 Six. Got it.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
 Twenty-one is nineteen.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
 Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
 Bandit One, am I hitting you?
 You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
 I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
 Bandit?
 Yeah?
 Why are we doing this?
 Because they said it couldn't be done.
 Bandit Two, do you read me?
 Loud and clear.
 Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
 He's history.
 Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.
Shit! No one's here.
 That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Let's keep it that way.
 Liquid gold.
 Redneck heaven.
You know how to drive one of these things?
Can a pig whistle?
 Hit the brakes!
They're jammed!
So much for whistling pigs.
Let's get the hell outta here.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
 Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
 We still on schedule?
 Forty-two minutes ahead.
 I hate to say I told you so.
 Save it. We got a long haul.
 Clear and rolling.
 Thanks.
 Hey...
 Who's the unlucky guy?
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
Bandit I, do you copy?
 This is Bandit I, come back.
 Who's the broad? Over.
Kate McConnell.
 Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
 Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
 Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Never fails. Bandit gets a chick. I get...
Hey!
 I swear to God, officer; the car was. already like this, we were just trying to...
Did you see the gal who was driving? She was wearing a wedding dress.
 Yes, sir. She got into a cherry- looking Cobra.
You get a look at the driver?
No, but he had Georgia plates. BAN- ONE.
Why're you driving so fast?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why? You have a bowling date?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
Who'd want to?
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
 A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
But you could get killed, right?
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
An existentialist.
 A what?
Eyes on the road.
 So tell me about yourself.
Okay.
Well?...
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Having fun.
Is this fun?
Driving?
Driving, talking to me...
They're both a challenge.
You have a great profile.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
Where you from?
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Seriously?!?
 Would I lie to you?
Guess what?
I give up.
You just passed your nemesis.
Smokey.
Better fasten your seat belt.
 Good idea.
 Bandit Two. I'm gonna leave you for a minute. Back in a flash.
 Keep 'er between the ditches.
What the hell's going on?
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
And I thought I had problems.
Anything?
 We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
Can I ask you something?
Shoot.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
 Bandit I. Bandit I. Do you read me?
 Say this is Bandit I. Then, over.
 This is Bandit I. Over.
 Where the hell are you?
 Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
 You can't swear on these.
 What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
 Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
 Shut up, Fred.
 Who's Fred?
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
 So will I, hoss. So will I.
 These things are fabulous.
You know, you're not a bad driver.
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
 Bandit II, do you copy?
 This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
 On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
 Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
 What's your twenty?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
 Not for long, you ain't.
 Breaker. Breaker.
 Go breaker.
 Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
 Go head on, breaker.
 I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
 What's your twenty and what's your handle?
 My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
 That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
 I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
 A Texas Bear in Arkansas.  Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is.
 I'm gonna get that bastard. No one makes Buell Clayton look like a fool. Let's get going.
 I'm whipping around you, Bandit II. Smokey on the rubber.
 You're gonna have to create your own lane, buddy. You got oncoming.
 You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Still with me?
 Bandit I, do I have copy?
 Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
 That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
 What's he...
 Uh, Cledus; I noticed.
 What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
 If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
 This is Sheriff Clayton. In pursuit of a black Shelby Cobra, Georgia license Boy-Adam-Nora. Ocean-Nora- Eddie. Request assistance.
 This is Sheriff Branford of Crossett County. We're already on this joker's case.  I got two units intercepting him at Hamburg crossing. You say you was a Sheriff?
 That's a big ten-four. Sheriff Buell Clayton. Texas.
 Texas? What the hell you doing in my goddam county?!?
 I said...
 I heard what you said. And I said...
 I don't care what you said. You're from Texas and what you said don't mean jack diddly here in Arkansas!
What the hell you looking at?
 This is Sheriff Clayton again. I lost the Cobra, but he's deadheaded toward you doing damn near 140. If I was you I'd set up a roadblock.
 -- And if I was you, I wouldn't be telling me what to do! Now take a hike, buster!!! (he angrily hangs up the mike and turns to his Deputy) Block the road.
Well?
We lost him.
 Bandit do you read me?
 This is Bandit, you're coming in long and strong.
 My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
 Thanks Silver Tongued Devil, we'll avoid.
 Adios.
 Classy guy.
Christ, it looks like a Smokey convention.
 We'll meet again, Bandit.
I'm gonna pass this fruit!
Just back off the hammer, boy.
But sir, he's gonna get away.
He ain't gonna get nothin' but a brief mention in the obituary column.
 The bridge up ahead is out.
 Listen, we can either give up or...
Just do it.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
 Christ, what channel are we on?...
Eleven.
 Bandit II. Bandit II. Give me a shout.
 I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
 What does the old Timex say?
 She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
 I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
 Bandit?
 Yeah, guy?
 Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy. (slaps Fred on the butt)
You heard the man. Step on it.
 The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
 Hey...
Enjoy your Kenworth.
 What's your pleasure?
 Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
No what?
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
Jesus, Richmond; you look like squirrel shit.
You wanna drive fourteen hundred miles for these cheap bastards? I feel like leaving my rig in the middle of the highway and tellin' them to kiss my antenna.
I know what you mean, good buddy.
Hi.
 The bus ain't passin' through these here parts for a piece.  I know. You only have a second.
They wouldn't take Master Charge so I traded in my gown.
 Coffee?
Please.
Jesus!!!
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
 Order up!
That's me.
See ya, Kate.
Ciao.
 Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
 Another time.
 -- Believe me, fellas; I'd love to schmoos, but...
Don't be so conceited. You don't even know us.
 To know us, is to love us.
Hey, how y'all doin'?
Who wants to know?
Listen, guys; I'm in a rush. Otherwise I'd arrange it so they had to carry you outta here in doggie bags.
You and what goddamn army?
 Bandit, please...
 Bandit?!? You're the Bandit? The fella been runnin' the blue troopers ragged?
Lemme shake your hand, boy! You're my new goddamn idol.
 You're the rage of CB land. We been followin' you for hours.
If we'da known you was the Bandit, we wouldn't a never lipped off to your old lady.
Well, she's not exactly my...
 Lemme have your autograph, hoss!
I've done twenty-eight Broadway shows and no one's ever asked me for an autograph.
 Listen, guys, I gotta cover ground. I'm due in Atlanta in less than ten hours.
Good luck.
Give our best to Jimmy Carter.
It's on the house.
 Thanks.
Son...
Godspeed.
 What the hell are you doing?!?
 He's after us again!
You know this guy, don't you?
 I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
By stealing my car?
I would've come back for you.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I'm gonna get you, you dirty, stinking, rotten sumbitch.
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
You could've asked.
You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
Like what?
My first father was a redneck. He taught me how to drive fast and pants people.
 Breaker, this is Bandit I, how are your vocal cords?
 My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
 On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
 Do I have a choice?
 What's your twenty?
 'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
 I just passed two Kojacks with a Kodak.  Man, this highway's crawling with Bears. Ain't no way we gonna make Atlanta on time without you runnin' blocker.
 I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
 What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
 As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
 If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
I think we should switch seats.
 You go ahead. This seat's more comfortable.
Mississippi's the other way!
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
 -- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
 Uh-oh.
I think you'd better let me...
Baseball needs a little pizzazz.
 This is beginning to piss me off.
 -- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
 I'm at marker eight-five.
 Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
 Yes, ma'am.
How's your twenty?
Here you go, pal.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
I ran into complications.
I hate to say it...
Then don't.
 -- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
 Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
 We're gone.
Bandit?
 Nice ass.
 Let's hit it.
 Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
 Let's roll, Fred.
C'mon, Fred.
 Fred!!!!!!
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
 I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
Your foot fall asleep?
 Bandit two, Smokey in a plain brown wrapper coming your way. Over.
 An unmarked police car.
How do you know?
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
 What's the matter, Cledus? You got mike fright?  Bandit two, do you copy?
 Yeah, yeah, yeah? What's up?
 Never mind. It's nothing.
 Anything else you don't want me to know?
 Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
 I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
 You take the front, I'll take the back.
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
Now what?
We're outta motion lotion.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
Save my seat.
Say, Cobra: what's your pleasure?
Fill it.
Check the hood, my man?
Aw right. This is a clean machine. Yeah, I was thinking 'bout getting me one of these myself. But I figure I'm conspicuous enough to the police as it is, so why encourage them more, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
 Bandit, do you read me? Over.
 This is Bandit. Who we got on that end?
 Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
 Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
 You.
 Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
 You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
 Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
 That'll be eight-seventy two.
-- Outta ten.
 Have a smooth one, Cobra.
 It's all right. It's not your car. You're doing fine. Just keep going.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
I'll believe it when I see it.
 Breaker. Breaker.
Pick it up, Breaker.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Ask if he delivers?...
Been hearin' all 'bout y'all and wanted to let y'all know, y'all got the Mississippi Bears eatin' their badges. They can't find hide nor hair of y'all.
-- This is Sheriff Buell Clayton, Texas Highway Patrol. That Cobra y'all been lookin' for with Georgia plates, ain't got no more Georgia plates. She's now running with Mississippi tags. Charles. Alan. Richard. Two. Seven. Three. Vehicle now southbound on Interstate 82. Heading for Alabama.
 -- That's a big ten-four, Texas. Now, we gonna nail that joy ridin' sumbitch.
I'm proud of you.
Yeah?
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
Good-byes are always tough.
 What happened?
 Bandit two, come on.
 I'm all ears, good buddy.
 You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
 It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
 We'll be waiting. Over.
 Are we in Atlanta already?
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
 You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Kate...
Ummm?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
 I'm gonna dedicate this next one to a man out there who's capturing the hearts of us all. Hey, Bandit; take care of yourself and your woman. Hear? It's raining out and the Red- Headed Stranger's singing this one especially for you.
 Hey, pumpkin pie, how you doin'? I should be home real soon. Yeah, Fred's fine. Still po'ed? See, time heals all wounds. Anyway, just wanted to check in. Okay, sweetie. You too. Bye-bye.
Hey, man; this your goddam mutt?
He just bit me.
Fred? C'mon, man; he don't bite.
I said the mother bit me.
He couldn'ta bit you. He's got better taste than that.
Hey, back off, huh!?!
Animals like this should be put to sleep.
Yeah, let's put the poor little sumbitch outta his misery.
 Hey, pal; I told you. Cut that shit out.
 Hey, c'mon fellas...
That's seventy-three eighty-four.
Pay me next time through, son.
Bandit I, bring yourself in.
 Bandit I, do you copy?
 We're listening, Bandit II. Back.
 Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
 You okay?
 Just fine. What's the weather like?
 God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
 Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?
How 'bout one more for the road?
 -- How we doing?
 It's gonna be close. Real close.
 -- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
And?
He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
My very words.
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
 Bandit II?
Talk to me.
 We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
Let's boogie.
All right, Kate. You clock it and let Cledus know when this school bus goes through.
 Bandit two, you read me?
 You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
 A yellow school bus just flew past us. I'll count up to closing time -- starting... Now. 27, 28, 29, 30, 31...
...40, 41, 42, 43, 44...
...45, 46, 47...
 ...48... 49... Here comes a black Porsche. Pull in.
 Here we go again, Bandit II.
 Goddammit. I'm in a goddam hurry, goddammit!!!
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
What kind of a guy is he?
The minute you see him, you'll know.
 This is Bandit. I'm about twenty- five miles outside of Georgia. Heading in on Eighty-five and looking for a Smokey report.
 This is First Madame, Bandit.
 We knew you'd be coming our way and decided to take care of the Bears for you. You know, a little personalized roadside service.
Send me the bill, First Madame.
Better yet. Why don't you pay up in person?
Maybe I'll catch you on the flip- flop. Over and out.
Believe me, she's got a heart of gold.
What are you gonna do when you get home?
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Thanks, Kate.
 Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
 Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
 What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?
 Come head on, Bandit. We'll slip you into the rocking chair.
 Mister B, I don't know how to thank you.
 Thank me by not getting caught.
 Bandit II?
 I'm all ears.
 You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
Hot Lanta, here we come!
Why are you stopping?
Weight Station.
 Bandit II?
 I'm here.
 You're coming up to the scale house.
 I'm cucumber cool.
 What's the problem?
 Oh, Jesus...
Yep.
Hey, I'm a truckin' whore. They got the money, honey; I got the time.
Wanna open her up?
C'mon fella, this paint's due in Savannah yesterday.
Word is some joker's running blocker for an illegal load. We're just spot checking.
C'mon, Ebersol... I've been through this chicken coop a hundred times...
 We're just gonna take a quick peek- see. You'll be outta here in no...
 ...in high speed pursuit of a black Shelby Cobra. Mississippi license Charles-Alan-Richard -- two-seven- three. Vehicle eastbound on Interstate seventy-two. Request assistance.
Oh, dear God in heaven!
What'll we do for excitement on our second date?
 Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
 What's that, pardner?
 Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.
 I think it's time to call a mayday.  Breaker. Breaker. This is Bandit to Hot Pants. Come back.
 Why should I?
 Because I need your help, sweet thing. (glancing back, the five Smokeys gaining ground) And I need it bad.
 I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
 Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
 What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
 Yes.
 I'm begging.
 I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
 But you'll do it?
 I'll do it.
 I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
 You sure do.
 Yes, I actually dated a woman who still wears hot pants.
 How's the clock, Bandit II.
 Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
Hey, this could be the biggest house I ever played to.
Paydirt!
-- We just picked up the Cobra eastbound on Interstate 72 heading for the Peach Tree Classic. Over.
All units converge.
Talk about being popular...
 I hate to say it, man; but I think it's over. Time to lay down our hand.
 Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
 Yeah, but...
 When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
 But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
 Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
 You got my barley pop?
What do you think?
 Have any trouble getting here?
About one to five years worth.
 One to five?
 Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
 Well, I guess I gotta hand it to you.
 I wonder if they'll let you take a K- Whooper to prison?
 Mind if I cream your son?
 Don't sweat it. I'll have y'all out on bail in no time. Fools like you are valuable.
 Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
Well, thanks for the lift.
 Hey...
 What can I say?
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
 Get your hands off my daughter!
Your what?
 He's just exhausted.
That man is your father?!?
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
Absolutely.
 Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking.
What are you thinking?
 You gotta admire the man's determination.
 Well, was it worth it?
 I'll take care of Fred.
See ya, Bandit.
See ya, Kate.
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
