INTERCOM Dick Laurent is dead.
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
What are you going to do?
I thought I'd stay home and read.
Read?... Read what, Renee?
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
I like to laugh, Fred.
That's why I married you.
Wake me up when you get home.
What's that?
A videotape.
Who's it from?
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Does it say anything on the tape?
 No, nothing.
Well, let's see what's on it.
 Come on.
It must be from a real estate agent.
Maybe.
Good book, huh?
 Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Same one you were reading the other night?
What night?
When you didn't come to the club.
Oh. Oh, yeah.  No. This is a different one.
I called, you know.
Called?  When?
From the club.  You didn't answer.
I must have fallen asleep.  I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
 I told you you could wake me up if you wanted to.
I had a dream about you last night...
Yeah?
You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
 Fred?  Fred, where are you?
Then there you were... lying in bed... but it wasn't you... It looked like you... but it wasn't.
Fred, are you all right?
You're up early.
That dog woke me.  I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Who the hell owns that dog?
What's that?  Another tape?
Yes, I just found it on the step.
Don't you want to watch it?
I guess so.
Well, do you wanna watch it?
Yeah.
We've got to call the police.
All right.
...yes, I've been on hold for ten minutes... I can't... All right, thanks.
Hello, yes... Good... My name is Renee Madison... My husband is Fred Madison, the jazz musician... we    live at 442 Hollis Street... Right... 442 Hollis... near the observatory... Someone's been in the house... at night... while we were sleeping... I know because they sent, dropped off a videotape... two videotapes... to show us... That's right... Yes... it... the second one... shows us asleep... Someone broke in and taped us while we slept!... Isn't that enough?... Okay, sure... We will... 442 Hollis... Yes, we'll be here.
So?
Two detectives are coming out.
That's it.
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
Very strange.
What is?
The angle.  The high angle shot on the tape.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Right ... This just glided along.
This is the bedroom.
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
This is our bedroom.
There's no other bedroom?
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
You're a musician?
Yes, I thought my wife ...
What's your axe?
Tenor... Tenor saxophone.  Do you...
 Tone deaf.
 Do you own a video camera?
No. Fred hates them.
I like to remember things my own way.
What do you mean by that?
How I remember them.  Not necessarily the way they happened.
Do you have an alarm system?
Yes, actually we do... but we haven't been using it.
Why not?
It kept going off for some reason.  False alarms.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
No.
Maid?  Relative?
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in.  Nobody else has a key.
 Let's check the doors and windows... See if there's been a break-in.
As best we can.
If anything else happens, you'll call us. Al hands Fred a card.  Ed hands Renee a card.
We will.
Thanks, guys.
It's what we do.
What the hell is going on?!
 I wish I knew.
What was that?!!!
What?
On the tape!  There was something else on the tape.
There!  Play it!
You don't remember being awakened?  It looks like you were aware of someone.
Or something.
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
Why would anyone do something like this?
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
Or not so recently?
No, not to me.
I...    no. No. No threats.
We'll take the tapes with us, if that's all right with you?
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
I don't know if I want to stay here.  I don't feel safe.
Where would you feel safe?
I don't know. maybe a hotel.
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
The first night ... Not the last two.
Why not?
 I forgot.  Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
Acting paranoid?!!! Someone is in our house while we're sleeping, filming us, and you don't want to act paranoid?!!! I thought you set the alarm!
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
But that doesn't solve the problem.  Who is doing this?  And why?
We'll find out, Mrs. Madison.
We've met before, haven't we?
I don't think so.  Where was it that you think we've met?
At your house.  Don't you remember?
 No, no I don't.  Are you sure?
Of course.  In fact, I'm there right now.
 What do you mean?  You're where right now?
At your house.
That's absurd.
Call me.
 Dial your number.
 Go ahead.
How did you do that?
Ask me.
 How did you get into my house?
Who are you?
It's been a pleasure talking to you.
I thought you were getting me a drink?
Just a minute.
Andy, who is that guy?
 I don't know his name.  He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
Dick Laurent?
Yes, I believe so.
 But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
He is?  I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
I don't.  I don't know him.
 Dick can't be dead.  Who told you he was dead?
Honey, who?... Who's dead?
Let's go home.
But...
Now!  We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
How'd you meet that asshole, Andy, anyway?
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
What job?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
He's got some fucked up friends.
Stay in the car!
I told you to stay in the car!
Why? what is it?  Why did you make me wait out here?
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Was there?
No... of course not.
It's so odd... Waiting out there, I had the strangest feeling... Like this had happened before.  I mean, your telling me to stay outside while you went in like that.
 Fred?  Fred, where are you?
Renee!
 RENEE!
Stay put, killer!
I didn't kill her! Tell me I didn't kill her!
Hi, doc. Workin' late tonight, huh?
Party at the mayor's house, George.  This is his daughter, Joyce.
Howdy, Joyce.
Howdy, George.
 Just like Christmas.
I don't know if I can watch this.
 Leave any time you want, lover.  I won't take it personally.
 Easy, girl, easy.
You talking to me or... her?
 A corpse can tell you plenty, Joyce.
Have you reached a verdict?
Yes, we have, your honor.
Please hand it to the bailiff.
And what is your verdict?
We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree.
Fred Madison, the jury having found you guilty of murder in the first degree, it is my order that on a date to be determined, you be put to death in the electric chair.
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
How could I miss it?  The TV won't quit with that stuff.
They're gonna cook him.
Andy's from Utah.  He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
Which would you choose?
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
The heart, I guess.
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on.  Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity.  Savage pain, Marian.
Oh, that's hot... So you'd rather be hung, huh?
Absolutely... Soon as your neck snaps, you black out.  It might take a while for the body to die, but you wouldn't feel it.
You might be right, Raquel.
Guess who?
Make yourself to home, fella.
 Here he comes.
See you soon, Sammy.  Don't think takin' a jolt is gonna get you outta payin' me back the twenty you owe me.
Don't take it personal, pal.
Un fuerte abrazo, amigo!
Hang in there, honey.
Keep an eye out for me, Sammy G.
Show 'em you got big stones, bro.
 Line check.  Okay.
Any final words, Sam?
Something wrong?
My... My head.
Headache, huh?  Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
No, no.  I want to go in.
What's botbering you, Madison?
The pain is getting worse.  I need more aspirin.
I can't give you anymore.  I'll talk to the doctor.
You sleeping okay?
 I can't sleep.
You'll sleep now.  Take him back to his cell.
What is it?
Aspirin... fly head.  I gotta have more aspirin.
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
But my head...
Shit, that wife killer's lookin' pretty fucked up.
 Which one?
Who are you?  What are you doing in this cell?
This is Johnny Mack at station 8. Yeah, look, somethin' crazy's happened.  No, I mean, Madison ain't in his cell.  No, there's somebody in there, but it ain't Madison! Right, right.  Okay... Captain Henderson's comin''?... Right.
F-u-u-u-ck me!
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
That's not Fred Madison?
No, sir, it's not.
Who is it?
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
Yeah, Mack?
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
Repeat that, Bill.
Warden, it's not him.  It .was not Fred Madison in that cell.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
I don't know.  The guards say they've never seen him before.
Where is he now?
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Did you ask him who he is?
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
I want to take a look at this man myself.
What is this, Rogoff?
I don't know yet.
Who is this man?
He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away.  We'll find out soon enough.
He's not Madison?
(slowly, deliberately Not even close.
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
A headache?
I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill.  I've never seen this man before.  Neither have the guards.  I don't think he's in the system.
Where the hell did you come from, mister?
Well, gentlemen, we know who the stranger is. His name is Peter Raymond Dayton. He's twenty-four years old.  His birthday is April 21st.  He was born and raised right here.  He lives with his parents, William and Claire Dayton at 814 Garland Avenue.  Pete Dayton was arrested five 
years ago for auto theft, for which he was put on probation for one year.  That was his first and only offense.  No record since then.
How about Madison?  Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
Nothing, Marsh.  Vanished.  There's an APB out on him.  His photo's been faxed nationwide.
How the hell does she know?
How the hell... 7
One of the guards must have leaked it.
What's the word on the street?
Good, let's keep it that way.  Keep a lid on Dayton.  Nothing gets out about him.
I have a statement to read... Fred Madison, an inmate being held on death row has, apparently... has escaped.  An all-points bulletin has been issued to authorities not only statewide, but nationwide.  We are confindent that he will be apprehended very soon.  No further details are available at this time.  Thank you very much.
Warden, nobody's ever escaped from death row before.  How did he get out?
I'm Warden Clements.  This is Captain Henderson and Dr. Rogoff.  Please, sit down.
Mr. and Mrs. Dayton, as you were told over the phone, your son, Peter, is here.
He... He was discovered this morning... in a cell on death row.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
The wife killer?
Yes.
How is this possible, Warden?
...Tell me, what was Peter's condition the last time you saw him?
His condition?  What do you mean?
His physical condition.
 Same as always.  Pete takes care of himself.
I saw him before he went to the garage day before yesterday.  He's a mechanic. Look, is he okay?  Can we see him?
He has a hematoma on his forehead and a condition called blepharitis... that's redness and swelling around the eyes.
Was he in a fight?
These conditions don't indicate a fight.
But what is the cause then? ... And how did he get in that cell?
He can't talk.  Or won't.
That doesn't sound like Pete.
Your son has experienced some sort of trauma, I'm afraid.  We were hoping that the two of you could help explain the cause of the trauma and how he came to be here.
You don't know Fred Madison?
No... Only what was in the news.
Do you think Pete knows him?
I wouldn't know how.
 You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
When he went to work, right.
What about yesterday?
He didn't come home.
Sometimes he stays at a friend's.
Any particular friends?
A girl's, a buddy's.  I don't know.  He's his own man; he comes and goes as he pleases.
I want to see him.
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
 Pete...
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
Pete, what happened to you?
It's okay.  Take your time, honey.
 Where ... am I?
You're in the state penitentiary.  You were found in a cell on death row.
My head hurts.
A man named Fred Madison was occupying that cell.  He's missing. we're trying to find out how it is you were in there and not him.
I... I don't know.
Do you know Fred Madison?
 No.
 Warden, can we take him home?
 From a medical standpoint, I don't see why not.
We need to find out what happened here.
 Have you made any charges against him?
No.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
 You just gonna let him go?
We'll get a tail put on him.
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
Are you hungry, honey?  I'll fix you something.
No... I don't feel so good.  I would like some aspirin.
Coming up.
Thanks, Al.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
Yeah.
I'm in the kitchen.
Where's Pete?
Out in back.
You talk to him?
 No... Here he comes.
How're you feelin'?
 Better.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'.  They miss you pretty bad down at the garage.  I told 'im you still had a "fever".
Okay.  Thanks.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Yeah.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
What night is that?
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Do you remember?
No... I don't.  Why?
Where the fuck have you been?
Hey.
You look like shit.
What happened?
Just haven't been feelin' well.
You're not contagious are you?
I don't think so.
Good... You up for a drive?
Where to?  Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
They found a cyst on my god damn ovary. Had to cut it out.  You wanna see the scar?
 Hadn't slowed her down none.
 Shut up, bone-head.
Just goin' up'ta "Tops"... Maybe the "Ten Pin".
Sheila'll be at "Tops".
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Okay.
 Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
Do ya good.
I hate ridin' in this fuckin' car.
Take it easy, Pete, "V" loves this rod.
Look at that goin' my way.
Oh my, oh my.
Keep it in your pants, "V".
This rod is a fuckin, embarrassment, Carl.  Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
Listen.
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
Hey.  Where have you been?
 You want somethin'?
No, I'm okay.
I missed you.
Yeah?...
Yeah.
What happened to your face?
Nothin'.
What are you guys doin'?
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
You want some company?
Sure.
 What's happenin'?
They're comin' with us.
 Pile in.
Why haven't you called me?
Sorry... I...
 What's happening to you?  What happened to your face?
I don't know.
 What do you mean? ... You've been acting strange lately ... Like the other night.
What night?
Last time I saw you.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Whatiya mean?
You were acting like a different person.
Who else could I be7
I don't know.
You still care about me?
Sure.  Sure I do.
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
You really don't remember?
No... I told you.
It was weird...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
I don't want to talk about it...
Sheila?!
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete.  How are you?
 Feeling good, Arnie.  Ready to get to work.
Wonderful, Pete.  Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy.
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy.  Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Sure.
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Sure, Arnie.  Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
PETE!!! WHERE'S PETE?!!
What happened?  Somebody givin' you trouble?
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Thanks, Mr. Eddy ... whatiya need?  Just the regular tune-up?
I want you to ride with me.  Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
Now listen... It only happens when I'm accelerating.  I think it's the carburetors.
No, it's not the carburetors.  Pull over, but keep it runnin'.
Best god damn ears in town.  You guys are lookin' at him.  The man with the best god damn ears in town.
Give that a try.
All right!
Beautifull Smooth as shit from a duck's ass.  Let's take a ride.
Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
Oh, shit... Is that what I think it is?
 This is where power and mechanical excellence pays off.
DON'T YOU EVER FUCKIN' TAILGATE.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
 I...    I didn't say anything...
Tell him you won't tailgate.
EVER!!!!
I won't ever tailgate.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
No.
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME.  I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES.  FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR. (hitting the driver once again - hard) CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
 FUCKIN' "A".
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
I can see that.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Eight, nine car lengths.  A hundred and sixty-two feet.
At sixty?
Fifteen car lengths.  About two hundred and seventy feet.
 What'd I tell ya.
Wait a minute ...
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.
You like pornos?
Pornos?
Yeah.  Give ya a boner.
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Suit yourself, champ.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
You will.
You recognize that guy?
Yeah... Laurent.
Why'd you change it?  I liked that.
Well, I didn't.
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
 Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy.  You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
It'll be ready.
You're my man, Pete.
What do you want?
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
I don't know.
Come on... get in.
Come here.
Why don't you like me?
I do like you, Sheila.
How much?
 Hi. I'm Alice Wyatt.
Pete Dayton.
I was here yesterday.
Yeah, I remember.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
 I don't know.
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
Look, I don't think it's a good idea.
Where's your phone?  I have to call another taxi.
 Over there.
 Can you give me the number for United Cab?
 Thanks.
 Yes, I need a taxi at Arnie's Auto Repair, the corner of Fifth and...
 We won't be needing a cab, thanks anyway.
Why don't we just skip dinner7
'Fucker gets more pussy than a toilet seat.
 Take off my clothes.
 I want more.
Me, too.
Can I call you?
Yeah... Call me at home.  I'll give you the number.
 Okay, baby.
 Is that car following us?
I'll lose 'em at the light.
I don't recognize the car...
 I'll get it!
 Hello.
 It's me...
Hi.
I can't see you tonight.
 Okay ...
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Sure.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Pete?
Me, too.
I'll call you again.
What's the matter?
Nothin'.
You okay, man?
What?
You okay?... What's wrong7
Pete... You okay?
Yeah.
I'm, okay... You okay?
Sure, I'm okay.
Where'd you come from?
I've been here.  You were lookin, right at me.
I was?
Yeah.
I didn't know you cared.
Come on.
 Pete... Pete...
What a fuckin' job.
His or ours?
Ours, Ed.
Hey.
Sit down a minute.
What's up?
Sit down.
You don't look so good.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
Yeah? what did they want?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night.  They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
But I don't remember anything.  What did you tell 'em?
 We saw you that night, Pete.
You came home.  Your friend Sheila brought you here.
Sheila?
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this.
We know that.
Who was the man?
Never saw him before in my life.
Did you tell the police this?
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
What happened to me?
Please tell me.
No.
Why didn't you tell me you brought me here that night?  To my house... my parents told me.  What are you tryin' to hide?  Sheila... Tell me... Who was with me?... Who was the man?...  ...When you brought me home!  What was he doin' there?  What are you cryin' about?...  Sheila?
How ya doin', Pete?
Okay.
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde?  She stayed in the car?...
Her name is Alice.  You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this ... (he opens his coat and pulls out his .44 Ruger Blackhawk and holds it up in front of Pete's face) ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
 What?
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
So, Pete, you're lookin, better.  What have you been up to?
 I'll get it.
Hello.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
 Okay.
Up here... Come on.
I already got the room.
He'll kill us.
Are you positive he knows?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
So what do we do?
I don't know.
We should stop seeing each other.
No... no.
I don't want to live without you.
We have to get away... We have to get some money.
I know a guy... He pays girls to party with him... He always has alotta cash...
He'd be easy to rob... Then we'd have the money... and we could get away ... We'd be together.
Have you partied with him?
I used to.
You like it?
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
What deal?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
What's he do?
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
Pornos.
Yeah.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
Pete... Don't...
How'd it happen, Alice?
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends.  He told me about a job...
In pornos?
No... A job... I didn't know what.  He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
 I went to this place... They made me wait forever.  There was some guy guardin' the door... I started gettin' nervous... In another room I could see some guy liftin' 
weights... Both these guys gave me the creeps... They never said anything to me... So I just smoked cigarettes and waited.
Why didn't you just leave?
You liked it.
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
I don't want you to go away.
 I love you, Pete.
 I love you, Alice.
So, should I call Andy?
Andy?
That's his name...Andy.  Our ticket out of here.
Yeah.  Call him.
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus ... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
Okay...
Lemme call him now.  Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Okay.
Andy?... It's me, Alice.  How ya doin?...  Andy... I can get away tomorrow night... I could come to your house... That sounds good... Around nine... Yeah, me too, Andy... Great... See ya then.
Set.
Why are ya goin' so early?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
I'm not goin' home tonight ... I'm goin' somewhere else..  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Oh, yeah?... What else?
This... and this.
Are you my man?
 Yes.
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
Are you?
 THERE'S SOMEONE WITH HIM!!
 Sheila?
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
Sheila...
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
Hey... Sheila.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
YOU'RE SORRY!!
Go home, Sheila.
YOU'RE SORRY!! YOU PIECE OF SHIT!! YOU'RE SORRY!!
FUCK YOU!!
Sheila... Stop...
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
Why don't you two come inside and talk things over quietly... Come on... Come on in, Sheila.
 You are different.
Sheila...
 TELL HIM!
Sheila... Don't.
I don't care anyway... I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton... I won't bother you or any member of your family again.
Pete... There's a man on the phone.  He's called a couple of times tonight.
Who is it?
He won't give his name.
Hello.
 Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Who is this?
You know who it is.
Mr. Eddy?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Okay.
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
Yeah.
That's good, Pete.  Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
We've met before, haven't we?
I don't think so.  Where was it that you think we've met?
At your house.  Don't you remember?
No. No, I don't.
We just killed a couple of people...
What?
You heard me... We thought we'd come over and tell you about it.
What's goin' on?
Great question!! In the east ... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think?  It's been a pleasure talking to you.
Pete... I just wanted to jump on and tell you I'm really glad you're doin' okay.
You got him.
 Alice, I...
 Wow!
Put this in your pocket.
You all right?
We killed him.
You killed him.
Alice?
It was an accident... Accidents happen every day.
Alice...
 We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Is that you?  Are both of them you?
That's me.
Pete?...
Where's the bathroom?
Up the stairs - down the hall.
 Did you want to talk to me?
  Did you want to ask me "why"?
Don't you trust me, Pete?...
Stick that in your belt.
 Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Alice?
Come on, baby.
You drive.
Come on.
We have to go to the desert.  He's at his cabin.
We'll have to wait.
Why me, Alice?  Why choose me?
So we can be together... You still want to be with me, don't you Pete?
More than ever?
I want you... I want you...
You'll never have me.
Here I am.
Where's Alice?
Alice who?
 Her name is Renee.  If she's told you her name is Alice, she's lying.  AND YOUR NAME, WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR NAME?!
You just got in before the big storm hits.
I need a room.
Hey, Al, look at this.
It's her, all right.  Fred Madison's wife ... with Dick Laurent and Mr. Dent- head over there.
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
You know what I think?
What's that, Ed?
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
Renee?
What the fuck? What's going on?
 You're coming with me.
 What do you guys want?
 Now you can hand it back to me.
 You and me, mister, we can really out- ugly the sumbitches, can't we?
 Dick Laurent is dead.
