At 3 P.M. on this particular day, this was happening-
I'll knock your block off, you big stiff ! You're a bum !
Strike ! You're out !
I wonder if any big shots are getting married today ? They stop at the door of the room.
Hey, the guy with the cheaters.
Mortimer Brewster, the dramatic critic ?
"Two by two they come and go. Hip hip hig hay !"
Good morning, children. Your name, please ?
Elaine Harper.
THE CLERK Speak a little louder.
Elaine Harper.
Thank you. Yours ?
Mortimer Brewster. The clerk puts his hand back around his ear.
How's that ?
Mortimer Brewster.
Speak up, sonny. There's nothing to be afraid of.
I want to keep this undercover.
Love her ? But of course you love her. You're going to marry her, aren't you ?
No-no, you don't understand. Come here, come.
You see, I don't want this to get out for a while. I'm Mortimer Brewster.
You're who ?
Mortimer Brew...
Mortimer takes the receiver from him and speaks into it.
Goodbye, dear.
Don't you understand ? How can I marry you ? Me, the symbol of bachelorhood. I've sneered at every love scene in every play. I've written four million words against marriage ! Not only hooked, but to a minister's daughter, and not only a minister's daughter but a girl from Brooklyn. And look at the way you look ! What is that sort of contraption you've got there ?
That's a pin I borrowed from your aunts. You know what they're saying, "Something borrowed..."
Yeah, I know that "Something borrowed, something blue." Old, new. Rice and old shoes. Carry you over the threshold. Niagara Falls. All that silly tripe I made fun for years. Is this what I've come to ? I can't go through with it. I won't marry you. And that's that.
Yes, Mortimer. MORTIMER What do you mean, Yes, Mortimer ? Aren't you insulted ? Aren't you going to cry ? Aren't you going to make a scene ?
No, Mortimer.
And don't No, Mortimer me, either ! Don't you see marriage is a superstition. It's old-fashioned. It's... a... a... Ohh !...
The girl in front of Elaine winks to Elaine. Elaine winks back to her.
O'Hara, don't be a jerk. You don't seem to realize. I'm turning over to you the nicest, the best beat in Brooklyn. Now look at that old church. And them old houses. O'HARA Did George Washington ever do any sleeping around here ?
Of course he did. Well, this whole neighborhood just stinks with atmosphere. And look at that old house there.
Are the original owners still over there ?
Now, don't crack wise about the Brewster sisters. They're two of the dearest, sweetest, kindest old ladies that ever walked the earth. They're out of this world. They're like... they're like pressed rose leaves. They have come near a police call box. Brophy takes a key out of his pocket to open the box
Pressed rose leaves ?
The old girls must be kind of hard up, huh ?
No, no. Their old man left them fixed for life. And don't you call them the girls, either.
Brophy. Is Lieutenant around ?
Then, so why here do they rent a room for ?
They don't rent rooms. But you can bet if anybody came looking for a room, they wouldn't go away without a good meal and probably a couple of bucks in their pockets. That's just their way of digging up people to do good to.
Reverend Harper, I do hope you don't disapprove of Mortimer just because he's a dramatic critic and takes your daughter to the theater every night.
It's not so much that I disapprove of his being a critic, but no man, no man with this published attitude on marriage...
...should take any man's daughter anyplace...
...at any time.
I must be catching cold.
 No, dear. It was Reverend Harper who sneezed.  Bless you.
We mustn't be angry with Mortimer. He's so very much in love with her. And Sister Martha and I are so happy about it. He used to come to see us only occasionally, and now, now he's in Brooklyn six nights a week.
Remember now, watch your language.
Besides, you know I'm not a swearing man.
You'd be surprised what they'd consider swearing.
Oh, will you excuse me ?
No, no, Teddy, dear. Thank you. I'll go.
Oh, come right in, Mr. Brophy.
Miss Abby, we came for the toys.
Oh yes.
This is Officer O'Hara. He's taking over my beat.
How are you doing ?
May I welcome you to our neighborhood, Mister O'Hara.
Gentlemen, what news have you brought me ?
Colonel, we have nothing to report.
Huh ? He eventually understands what his Sargent is trying to tell him.
Oh no, absolutely nothing to report.
Splendid ! Thank you, gentlemen.  At ease.
You know the Reverend Doctor Harper from the church next door ?
Hello, Reverend. This is Officer O'Hara, the new man on the beat.
How do you do, sir ? It's nice to meet you.
The toys are on the chair up here, by the library door.
Oh, Teddy, will you run upstairs and bring down your Army and Navy from Aunt Martha's room. They're all packed.
That's splendid work you men do, fixing up discarded toys for the kids at camp.
Charge !
It gives us something to do as we are sitting around the station. You get tired of playing cards.
So these are the toys ?
How's Missis Brophy ?
Oh, she's better, thank you. But a little weak, still.
Well, I'll better get some beef broth for you to take to her.
Oh, Miss Abby, please don't bother. You've done so much already.
Oh, Stuff and nonsense ! I won't be a minute.
Gentlemen, if I know what pure kindness and absolute generosity are, it's because I've known the Brewster sisters.
Oh, Teddy, you promised me you wouldn't do that anymore.
But I have to call a Cabinet meeting to get the release of those supplies.
Now don't do that again. Do you hear me ?
He used to do that in the middle of the night, and neighbors raised Cain with me. They're a little afraid of him anyway.
Look, Sarge, I promised you I wouldn't swear, but what the heck...
...What's going on here anyway ?
Oh, he's quite harmless.
He thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt. So what, there's a lot of worse guys he could think he was.
Huh ?
That's right. I'll make a note of it. He's a very interesting character.
Isn't it a shame, Father, isn't it a shame, Reverend, that a nice family like this should be hatching a cuckoo ?
Oh, well, now, isn't this nice !
Good afternoon, Miss Brewster.
How do you do, Mr Brophy ?
Good afternoon, Miss Brewster. O'Hara has picked up the toys and he joins the group.
Reverend Harper, how do you do ?
Oh, Miss Martha, this is Officer O'Hara. He's taking over my duties.
How do you do, ma'am ?
I'm very glad to know you.
Thank you. Abby joins the group.
Oh, Martha, you're back.
Here's the broth for Missis Brophy. Be sure it's good and hot.
You bet I will, and thank you very much.
The Army and Navy are ready for action.
Oh, Colonel, this is grand. It'll make a lot of kids happy.
What's this ? The Oregon ?
Oh, Teddy, dear, put it back.
But the Oregon goes to Australia.
Now, Teddy...
No, it goes to Australia.
These are lovely. Thank you very much.
Not at all.
The children will go crazy.
Oh, now, don't mention it.
Well... So long, Colonel.
Hey, Sarge.
Hey ?
Oh, yes.
Dismissed !
Well, goodbye and thank you. ABBY Good bye.
Careful of the step here now with the toys.
Good night.
Young man, let that be a lesson to you.
Goodbye. She closes the door, and goes back to her sister and Reverend Harper.
Well...
Well, I must be going.
Charge !
Charge the blockhouse !
Blockhouse ?
Oh, the stairs are always San Juan Hill.
Oh, I...
Bless you !
Have you ever tried to persuade him he wasn't Teddy Roosevelt ?
Oh, no !
Oh, he's so happy being Teddy Roosevelt.
Oh, do you remember, Martha ? She comes back to her sister and Reverend Harper.
Once, a long time ago, we thought if he'd be George Washington, it might be a change for him, and we suggested it.
And do you know what happened ? He just stayed under his bed for days and wouldn't be anybody.
Well, if he's happy, and what's more important, you're happy...
Oh, our only worry for Teddy is after we are gone.
Yes, indeed. That is quite a problem.
But Mortimer's made all the arrangements for Teddy to go to Happy Dale Sanitarium after we pass on.
Splendid idea ! A very pleasant place.
Yes...
Dear, sweet Reverend Harper.
You know, Martha, I really do believe he's beginning to see the light.
I'm sure we needn't worry about him. He won't interfere with our plans for Mortimer and Elaine.
Oh, did you just have tea ?
Yes. And dinner's going to be late, too.
Ohh ! Why ?
Teddy ?...
Oh, Teddy, good news for you. You're going to Panama and dig another lock for the canal.
Delighted !
That's bully ! Just bully ! I shall prepare at once for the journey. He starts mounting the stairs, stops and goes back a few steps down, takes his imaginary sword out, points it forward, and runs upstairs, yelling :
Charge !
Abby ! While I was out ?
Yes, dear. I just couldn't wait for you. I didn't know when you'd be back, and Reverend Harper was coming.
But all by yourself.
Oh, I got along fine.
I'll run right downstairs and see.
No, no, dear. There wasn't time. And I was all alone.
Well ?
Martha, just look in the window-seat.
Oh ! It's Elaine !
You, darlings.
But, Elaine ! ABBY What did she mean ? You don't suppose they've gone and...
Elaine !
Listen, buddy. This old cab has seen osculation but...
You ain't seen anything yet. You've got to drive us to the station.
You'd better take her hat.
Oh thanks.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a... And her brooch.
If you find her hairpins, you can keep them. Hold on to that.
Yeah ! Mortimer runs across the churchyard to meet Elaine.
There they are.
Here's your hat.
Just throw it. I don't like that look in your eyes.
What ? What's the matter ?
Father preached in sermon about it only last Sunday. MORTIMER He did ? He did ? What did he say ? What did he say ?
He was against it.
Ah ! But that was only Sunday.
Please ! For heaven's sake !
But, Mortimer, right out here in the open with everyone looking ?
Yeah ! Right out here in the open with everyone looking. Let everyone in Brooklyn over 16 look.
But, Mortimer, you're going to love me for my mind, too ?
One thing at a time.
Oh ! There's that look again !
There's that look again, Mortimer ! You better get used to it.
Look like you're going to see it often. It goes just before this. He kisses her very passionately.
You know what we're doing, darling ? We're wasting time. Look, I'll go tell my aunts and you tell your old... No, you'd better not tell your father just yet. You'll run that cold of his into a pneumonia.
Oh, I can handle Father. He's a dear.
Look, why don't we wire him from Niagara Falls ?
Niagara Falls ?
Then that's why you stopped at your office.
Yes, certainly ! We're going to go the whole hog. Niagara Falls ! Everybody ought to go to Niagara Falls. You should've seen my secretary's face when I made the reservation. We've got a drawing-room on the train, the bridal suite in the hotel, and tomorrow morning we go over the falls in a barrel.
Go on, darling, hurry and pack.
I don't have to. I started packing the day after I met you. She starts moving away. He holds her back.
There, you see ! You see ? That's what I mean. That's what I hate about women.
I wonder what Mary's doing now ?
Go on, darling, the train leaves in an hour, and hurry.
It'll be a few minutes before I'm ready. Father may want to pray over me a little.
Whistle when you're ready. Oh, Elaine...
Yeah.
When you whistle, open the front door fast. If you see a tall, dark streak of light, it's me.
What ? Now ?
No, not now !
Look surprised when he tells us.
 Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha !
Hold on to your bustles. We're married. Elaine and I are married.
Oh, darling, how wonderful ! Oh, Martha, isn't it wonderful ? They're married!
Yeah ! Don't pretend to be so surprised either, you two old frauds. Can I use the telephone, darling ?
Yes, of course.
Isn't it too, too wonderful ?
And to think that it happened right here in this room !
Oh, now, here, here, now ! Hello ?... Hello ? Benson's Florists ? This is Mortimer Brewster. Did you send those roses to Missis Brewster's apartment ?... You did ? Good. Now, send four dozen more to drawing room A, Canadian Limited, Grand Central Station. Yes... And hurry then. And throw in a flock of orange blossoms.
But before you go, we can have our celebration. I'll open a bottle of wine and we'll sing. And we'll invite a few of the neighbors in.
And, of course, a wedding cake. MORTIMER Oh, darling, you won't have time to bake a cake. We're going to Niagara Falls. I've got a taxi waiting.
Oh, it's all ready. It's been ready since..
Yeah, I bet it's been ready since the first day I met her, huh ?
What is it ? Did everybody in Brooklyn know I was getting married, except me ?
Oh, we knew you'd find out about it in time.
Come here. I've got the two nicest aunts in the world. Of course, you've got the nicest nephew in the world, too.
Well, I'll run along and get everything ready.
Oh, dear. I do hope the Reverend isn't too angry. You know how your books upset him.
Well, I'm going to burn all my books. And I'll let the Reverend Harper light the first match. Oh, by the way, did I leave some notes here for my new book ?
You mean Mind Over Matrimony ?
Yes ! Shhh ! Where are they ?
I hid them someplace...
Come on, come on. Let's go.
Now you behave. She goes away on her search.
Let's find them before Elaine sees them.
Hello, Mortimer !
How are you, Mister President ?
Bully, thank you. Just bully. What news have you brought me ?
Just this, Mister President. The country's squarely behind you.
Yes, I know. Isn't it wonderful ?
Well, goodbye. I'm off to Panama.
Goodbye, Mister President.
A new lock for the canal, you know.
Oh, tell the news to Mother.
Oh, dear.
Did you find those notes ?
What's the matter ?
There's a baby picture of your brother Jonathan.
You ought to put that in the fire with my books. My, what a face !
I remember now. He used to scare grownups with it.
Just the thought of Jonathan frightens me. Do you remember how he used to cut worms in two with his teeth ?
Oh, Jonathan ? Oh, he's probably in prison or hanged or something by now.
I saw a play, which had a character in it. Reminded me of Jonathan.
No ? Really?
Yeah. Oh, a honey of a lunatic. One of those whodunits called Murder Will Out.
Oh, dear ! Abby goes into the kitchen.
Yeah, what a play. When the curtain goes up, the first thing you see is a dead body.
The next thing...
Hey, mister. He remains a few seconds seated of the seat, with a very puzzled face.
Happy bridegroom !
Congratulations, darling !
Never mind that now. I know.
Now, listen, darlings. Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha, you know how we've always planned to send Teddy to that Sanitarium, Happy Dale ?
Oh, yes, dear. That's after we're gone.
Yes, we talked with Reverend Harper about it.
No, no. Teddy's got to go to Happy Dale now. At once ! Now, he's down in the cellar. Get him up here right away.
But, there's no such hurry as yet, you know.
No... When Teddy's working on the canal, you can't get his mind on anything else.
Well, look, darlings. Look, I'm frightfully sorry, but I've got an awful shock for you.
Teddy's killed a man, darlings !
Nonsense !
 But there's a body in the window-seat !
Yes, dear. We know.
You know ?
Of course.
Yes, but it has nothing to do with Teddy.
Now, Mortimer. You just forget about it. Forget you ever saw the gentleman. MORTIMER Forget ?
We never dreamed you'd peek.
What the... Who is he ?
He's a Mister Hoskins. Adam Hoskins. That's really all I know about him, except that he's a Methodist.
Oh ! He's a Methodist ? Isn't that nice.
That's all you know ? But what's he doing here ? What happened to him ?
He died.
Look, Aunt Martha, men just don't get into window-seats and die.
No, dear. He died first.
Oh, well, now wait ! Stop all this.
Now look, darlings, how did he die ?
Oh, Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive. The gentleman died because he drank some wine with poison in it.
But, how did the poison get in the wine ?
Well we put it in wine because it's less noticeable. When it's in tea, it has a distinct odor.
You mean you...  You put it in the wine ? ABBY Yes. And I put Mister Hoskins in the window-seat, because Reverend Harper was coming.
Ohh ! Look at me, darling.
You mean, you mean you knew what you'd done and you didn't want the Reverend Harper to see the body ?
Well, not at tea. That wouldn't have been very nice.
Ohh ! It's first-degree.
Now, Mortimer, you know all about it and just forget about it. I do think that Martha and I have the right to our own little secrets.
Oh, Abby, while I was out I dropped in on Missis Schultz. She's much better. But she wants us to take Junior to the movies again.
Well, we must do that, tomorrow or next day.
Yes, but this time we'll go where we want to go. Junior's not going to drag me into another one of those scary pictures.
No, they ought not to be allowed to make those pictures just to frighten people.
Operator ?... Can you hear my voice ?... You can ?... Are you sure ?...
Then I must be here.
Aunt Abby ! Aunt Martha !
Oh, the dears. Isn't Halloween a wonderful time for them ?
Yes, it is. They have so much fun.
Now, Mortimer, don't be so impatient. We'll let you lick the bowl out.
Lick the bowl ? I don't want to lick the bowl. I want to know what we're going to do !
Well, we're going to celebrate, dear.
Celebrate ? There's a body in the window-seat !
Yes, dear. Mister Hoskins.
Oh, I know what his name is. I just want to know what we're going to do. We can't turn you over to the police.
Yes. You just should get stop worrying about it.
We told you to forget the whole thing.
 Forget ? Look, my dear aunt Martha, can't I make you realize that something has to be done ?
Now, Mortimer, you behave. You're too old to be flying off the handle like this. MORTIMER But, but Mister Hodgekiss...
Hoskins, dear.
But whatever his name is, you can't leave him in there.
We don't intend to, dear.
No, Teddy's down in the cellar now, digging the lock.
Oh, you mean you're going to bury Mister Hodgekiss in the cellar ?
Oh, yes, dear. That's what we did with the others.
Look, here, Aunt Martha. You can't...
Others ?
The other gentlemen.
Oh ! When you say others, do you mean others ? More than one others ?
Oh, yes, dear. Let me see now. This is eleven, isn't it, Abby ?
Oh no, dear. This makes twelve.
Abby, dear, I think you're wrong. This one is only eleven.
No, dear, because I remember when Mister Hoskins first came in, it occurred to me that he'd make just an even dozen.
But, look, Abby dear, I really don't think you should count the first one.
Oh, I was counting the first one, and that makes it twelve.
It does ?
Well, she's probably right. Abby usually is. I get them mixed up sometimes.
Makes it twelve. Well...
Hello ?
Oh !
Well, whatever is the matter with Mortimer today ?
Why, Abby, what do you think happened to him ?
Hello ?
Not now. Not now. For heaven's sake, keep your shirt on !
Oh... Oh, Elaine, I didn't mean...
Now, let's see. Where were we ? Twelve.  Twelve !
Yes, dear. Abby thinks we should count the first one.
Never mind about that. Just sit down.
Now, tell me, who was the first one ?
Mister Midgely. He was a Baptist.
He was such a lonely, old gentleman, Mister Midgely was.
All his kith and kin were dead.
We felt so sorry for him.
And then, when his heart attack came, and he sat there dead in that chair, looking so peaceful. Remember, Martha ? We made up our minds, then and there, that if we could help other lonely, old men to find that same peace, we would. MORTIMER Why, you poor... You mean, he dropped dead right in this chair ?
And then, you see, Teddy came up from digging in Panama, and he thought Mister Midgely was a yellow-fever victim. And that meant he had to be buried immediately.
So ?
So, we all took him down to Panama, and put him in the lock and gave him a decent Christian burial. There, now you see ?  That's why we told you not to bother about it, because we know exactly what's to be done. Mortimer is sitting on the table, and seems not to know what he must do next. But he suddenly stands up.
Wait a minute !
Come here, darlings. What about the others ? All twelve of them didn't walk in here and drop dead.
Oh, no, dear. Of course not !
Well, so, so...
Mortimer.
Wh... what?
Do you remember those jars of poison that were on the shelves in Grandfather's laboratory all these years ?
You know your Aunt Martha's knack for mixing things. You've eaten enough of her piccalilli.
Well, dear, for a gallon of elderberry wine, I take one teaspoonful of arsenic, then add half a teaspoonful of strychnine. And then, just a pinch of cyanide.
Mmmm ! Should have quite a kick.
Yes, as a matter of fact, one of our gentlemen found time to say : How delicious !
He did ? Well, wasn't that nice of him ?
Abby, we mustn't be standing here gossiping all night. Well, we must get that cake frosted.
Oh no, darling, don't worry about the cake. I couldn't eat a thing. ABBY Oh, you newlyweds! A sip of wine will give you an appetite.
That'd be nice, darling, a sip of... A sip of wine !
Wine !
I'm beginning to think the cat's in on this.
He's wonderful. Happy as a lark. Singing away, digging locks. He closes the cellar door.
Got him working on a yellow-fever victim. Oh, I can see the headlines now : Murder Incorporator Rides Again right across the front page. Let me see... Teddy ! Of course. Everybody knows he's crazy. Let me see. Who can I call up ? Dewey, La Guardia, Winchell ? No, Winchell's no good. Old Judge Cullman !
I wonder if I got his number.
What am I doing with tickets ? He throws the tickets on the desk. He picks up the phone, and starts dialing.
Information... Hello ? Information ?... Get me the number of Judge Cullman on North Shore Road, Brooklyn. Yeah, would you call me back ?
How it would be marvelous if he wasn't there.
 Hey, you !
Thought you were tall, dark streak of light.
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here ? Didn't you hear me whistle ?
Whistle ? Oh, yes, yes. I heard you whistle. But...
Hey, how do I look ?
Oh, you look fine, you look fine. Now, run on home. I'll call you up tomorrow. ELAINE Tomorrow ?
Yeah, you know I always call you up every day or two.
Oh ! you and your gags ! Where's your hat ? Come on. The bags are in the taxi.
Huh ? Taxi ? Huh, huh, huh ?
Yeah, come on !
Oh, Elaine, I'm so sorry. But something's happened.
What'd you do, lose your nerve ? Hey, where's that look I was going to see so often ?
Oh, stop ! Don't whistle in my ear, please.
Mortimer, what is wrong ? Look at your hair. He bends down for her to see his hair better.
Oh, my God, what color is it ? Quick ! Has it turned ?
Oh, darling, what's the matter ? What happened ?
Oh, Elaine, if I could only tell you, Elaine. You smell so nice.
Oh ! Oh !
You better go home !
But, darling, we were married today.
All right, go home, go to bed, get some rest !
Rest ?
Who ? Who ? Judge Cullman ?
This is Mortimer Brewster. Look, Judge, I'll tell you why I called you. It's about Teddy.
I've got to come over and see you right away. Oh, I'm afraid it won't wait until tomorrow, Judge. Yeah, you see, it's very, very important. We've got to do something about it immediately. But it's practically a matter of life and...
Elaine ! Elaine, frightened, jumps up from the seat. Mortimer rushes to her.
Will you get out of here ?
Mortimer, what in the world is going on around here ? I don't even know where I stand !
Anywhere, but don't stand there !
But, darling, Niagara Falls !
If it does, we'll let it ! ELAINE Now, wait a minute ! Listen. You can't marry me one minute and then throw me out the house the next !
Oh, darling, I'm not throwing you out of the house !
Will you get out of here ?
Mortimer !
I'm sorry, Judge. But... a thing happened. But, Judge, about Teddy, you see...
 Mortimer !
Hold it. You see, Judge, it's his bugle blowing. Yes, the neighbors have been complaining, and the police are all set to throw him into a state institution.
How do you like that ?
I read an ad here about a room to rent. ELAINE Oh ! Shut up !
Well, I thought that if you sign the papers, I can get Teddy to commit himself, and get him in Happy Dale... Yes, it's a wonderful place, Judge... You will ?... Fine ! I'll be over right as soon as I've made another call.
Doorbell's ringing, dear.
Oh, how do you do ? Come in. The kitchen door has remained open, and we see Martha still working on her cooking.
 I understand you've got a room to rent.
Yes... Do step in.
Well, are you the lady of the house ?
Yes, I'm Miss Brewster.
 Yeah, operator ? Give me long distance, please.
And this is my sister. Another Miss Brewster.
My name's Gibbs.
Well, do sit down. I'm sorry, but we're just setting the table for dinner.
Now, this would be a nice comfortable chair.
Oh. Hello, long distance ? I want the Happy Dale Sanitarium, Happy Dale, New York.
Is Brooklyn your home ?
I haven't got a home. I live in a hotel. Don't like it. MARTHA A... are your family Brooklyn people ?
 Hello ? Hap...
Haven't got any family.
 Well, operator...
All alone in the world ?
Yeah.
 No, no...
Well, Martha....
 No, Happy Dale... Yes.
Well, you've come to just the right house. You sit down.
 Dale. D like in dig, you know, when you dig a lock. That's right. A like in arsenic. Got that ?
Is there always this much noise ?
Oh ! He doesn't live with us.
I can see the headlines now. Oh, please.  Hello ? Back to the table.
I'd really like to see the room. Well, I don't think I'll like it.
The room's upstairs.
Won't you try a glass of our wine before we start up ?
Never touch it.
Well, we make this ourselves. It's elderberry wine. GIBBS Elderberry ?
I haven't tasted elderberry wine since I was a boy.
 Oh...
Thank you.
 Operator ! Well, I don't want the Happy Dale Laundry ! I want the Happy Dale Sanitarium ! Sanitarium ! Sanitarium ! Sanitarium ! Yes, like a broken record !
Have your own elderberry bushes ?
No, but the cemetery's full of them.
Well, skoal.
 Hello, operator! No, operator, what's taking you so long ? It's only across the river ! I could swim it faster ! Yes ! Hello ! Hello...
 What ?... What, they're busy ? Busy ? They're busy and you're dizzy ! No, I'm not drunk, madam, but you've given me an idea !
Mortimer ! Ah-ah ah-ah !...
Darling, don't ah-ah ah-ah, I'm nervous. Don't do this.
Mortimer. Not that.
Get out of here ! Do you want to be poisoned, do you want to be murdered, do you want to be killed ? Do you ?
They... they're nuts !
Hey, you're telling me !
Look, you can't do things like that !
Now I don't know how I can explain this to you, but it's not only against the law, it's wrong.
Oh, piffle !
It's not a nice thing to do. People wouldn't understand.
He wouldn't understand. What I mean is... Well... This is developing into a very bad habit !
Oh... Yes...
Hello ?... Who ?... Oh, Happy Dale Sanitarium ? Oh, that's amazing, operator. Yeah... Happy Dale ? Oh, let me talk to Mister Witherspoon, please.
Mr. Witherspoon speaking... Oh, how do you do, Mister Brewster ? How are you ?
Uh... uh... Well, Mister Witherspoon, do you... Oh, I'm fine, thanks. How are you ? Mister Witherspoon, do you remember that conversation we had about committing my brother Teddy to Happy Dale ?... You do ? Well, we want to commit him there immediately.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, that's too bad. Well, I'd hoped we wouldn't have him for some time yet. Well, you see, Mister Brewster, we have several Theodore Roosevelts at the moment, and it would lead to trouble. Oh, trouble... Oh, now, if he thought that... Look, Mr. Brewster, we're a bit short of Napoleons at present. The Bonaparte. And if... Oh... oh, I see. Of course. Well, if your mind is made up. Yes. Yes. Have you had the papers drawn up ?
No, but I'm going to attend to it right now and call you as soon as I have them. Thank you, Mister... What ?... All right. Thank you, Mister Witherspoon.
Another Roosevelt. Oh, dear, dear.
Now listen, darlings. I've got to run over to Judge Cullman's, but, before I go, I want you to promise me something.
Well, we'd have to know what it was first.
Well, I love you both very much. And you know I'd do anything in the world for you, don't you ?
Yes, dear.
All right, then I want you to do one little thing for me, like good girls. ABBY What do you want us to do ?
Don't do anything. I mean, don't do anything ! Don't let anyone in the house and leave Mr. Whosit right where he is. Oh ! Get off that thing. I can't talk to you... I can't concentrate.
Now, look, darlings, I wouldn't want anything in the world to happen to either of you.
But, what on earth could happen to us?
Well, darling... Anyway, you'll do that little thing for me, won't you ? All right. Abby nods.
Where's my hat ? There it is.
But, Mortimer.
 What, darling, what ?
We were planning to hold services before dinner.
Look, couldn't that wait until I get back ?
Oh, and you could join us in the hymns !
Yes, darling, I could join you in the hymns. I'll sing with you, I'll dance with you, I'll do anything. But... remember, don't let anybody in the house until I get back. You promise ?
Good.
 Mortimer !
What ?
Uh-uh-uh-uh !...
Stop that uh-uh-uh. What is it ?
Mr. Hoskins' hat !
Ohhhh !...
Do you still want me to wait here ?
Yes ! Call me a cab !
Yeah. Okay, okay !
Hey, cab !... Here you are.
Don't open it. I'll sit with you !
Yeah, that's right. I can go faster that way. Sure.
Wait a minute ! What am I doing ? Hey !
Come here !
Fancy getting nice Mr. Hoskins' hat all mussed up.
Shame ! Such a nice hat. She crosses the room and, takes a brush on a cupboard near the window-seat, and starts brushing the hat.
You know, Abby, Mortimer didn't seem to be quite himself today.
No. Oh, well.
Well, what were you saying about Mortimer ?
Oh, I think I understand why he seemed so upset.
Why ?
He's just been married. I believe that always makes a man a little nervous.
Oh, yes. The poor dears.
I'm so happy for Elaine. Oh, Abby ! If Mortimer's coming back for the services for Mr. Hoskins, we're going to need another hymnal. There's one up in my room.
Oh, I'll go, dear.
Abby, we promised Mortimer we wouldn't let anyone come in.
Abby ! Two men, and I've never seen them before.
Are you sure ?
Yes. ABBY Let me look.
You look.
Do you recognize them ?
No, they're strangers to me.
Well, we'll just have to pretend we're not at home.
Come in, doctor.
This is the home of my youth. As a boy, I couldn't wait to escape from this house. Now I'm glad to escape back into it.
Yes, Johnny, it's a good hideout.
The family must still live here. I hope there's a fatted calf awaiting the return of the prodigal.
A fatted calf ? Oh, Johnny, I'm so hungry.
Look, Johnny. Drink.
As if we were expected. DOCTOR EINSTEIN Yes.
A good omen.
Who are you ? What are you doing here ?
Aunt Abby. Aunt Martha. It's Jonathan.
You, you get out of here !
I'm Jonathan, you know. Your nephew, Jonathan.
Oh no, you're not. You're nothing like Jonathan, so don't pretend you are. You just get out of here.
I see you're still wearing the lovely garnet ring that Grandma Brewster bought in England. And you, Aunt Martha, still the high collar to hide the scar where Grandfather's acid burned you.
Why, his voice is like Jonathan's.
Have, have you been in an accident ?
My face. Doctor Einstein is responsible for that. He's a plastic surgeon.
But I've seen that face before. Do you remember when we took the little Schultz boy to the movies and I was so frightened ? It was that face.
Take it easy, Johnny. Take it easy. Don't worry. The last five years, I give him three different faces. I give him another one right away. That last face. I saw that picture, too, just before I operated. I was intoxicated.
You see, doctor, what you've done to me ? Even my own family think I'm...
Johnny, Johnny ! You are home in this lovely house.
You know how many times he tells me about... about Brooklyn, about this house, and about his aunts he loves so much ? They know you, Johnny. Please tell him so.
Well, Jonathan, it's been a long time.
Bless you. It's good to be home again.
Well, Martha, we mustn't let what's on the stove boil over.
If you'll excuse us for a moment, Jonathan. Unless you're in a hurry to go somewhere.
Well, Johnny, where do we go from here ? You know, Johnny, we got to think fast.
The police, they got pictures of that face. I got to operate on you right away. We got to find someplace. We got to find someplace for Mister Spenalzo, too. While talking, he has taken another sip from his bottle.
Don't waste any worry on that rat.
But we got a hot stiff on our hands.
Forget Mr. Spenalzo.
But, Johnny, we can't leave a dead body in the rumble seat. You shouldn't have killed him. Just because he knows something about us, what happens ?
We come to him for help and he tries to shake us down. Besides, he said I looked like Boris Karloff. That's your work, doctor. You did that to me.
No, please, Johnny, take it easy. We'll find some place and I'll fix you up right away.
Tonight.
Yes, tonight, but I have to eat first.
This time, I want the face of an absolute nonentity.
Yes, Johnny. I know exactly what I'm going to do.
You see, I'm going to take this piece here and lift it up...
Be careful about the stitches this time.
You leave that up to me. I'll give you nice little ears and...
You were careless last time. DOCTOR EINSTEIN And new stitches. And on the eyes I'll do a Schmidt. That's my specialty. You see, I take it together like this...
Leave the eyes alone. Leave the nose alone.
Poor Teddy. I imagine it's for the best.
Well... Ours not to reason why, ours but to do...
Sign right here, please, Judge. Excuse me. Right there.
Sometimes I think, with the world in its present chaotic state...
Yes, I know, we'd all be better off at Happy Dale. I sign here as next of kin, don't I ?
Only last week I created a mild sensation at the Bar Association, when I said...
Yes. Goodbye. Good luck, Judge. Thank you.
Tell Martha and Abby I'll be over this week. I've been feeling rather lonely.
No ! No ! Oh no ! Never tell them you've been lonely. Never ! JUDGE CULLMAN Why, I... I... I...
Judge ! Tell me, are you a drinking man ?
Why, no. I never indulge.
Good ! Then you'll live longer.
Of course a little wine now...
No ! No ! For heaven's sake, no wine ! No wine !
I may be committing the wrong Brewster.
Well, I'm sure you both want to get to wherever you're going.
My dear, sweet aunties, I'm so full of your delicious dinner I'm unable to move a muscle.
Yes, it's nice here.
I found it ! I found it !
Gentlemen, be seated. Jonathan and Einstein pretend they are standing up, but they immediately sit back in their chairs.
Here it is, gentlemen. The story of my life, my biography.
Here's the picture I was telling you about, General. Here we are, both of us. President Roosevelt and General Goethals at Culebra Cut. That's me, General, and that's you.
My, how I've changed !
Well, you see, that picture hasn't been taken yet. We haven't even started work on Culebra Cut. We're still digging locks. And now, General, we will both go to Panama and inspect the new lock.
No, Teddy. Not to Panama.
Oh, maybe some other time, Mister President. Panama is a long ways off. TEDDY Nonsense ! It's just down in the cellar.
The cellar ?
Well, we let him dig the Panama Canal in the cellar.
General Goethals ?
Yes, sir.
As President of the United States, Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, and the man who gave you this job, I demand that you accompany me on the inspection of the new lock.
Teddy ! I think it's time for you to go to bed.
I beg your pardon. Who are you ?
I'm Woodrow Wilson. Go to bed.
No, you're not Wilson. But your face is familiar. Let me see... You're not anyone I know now. Perhaps later, on my hunting trip to Africa. Yes, you look like someone I might meet in the jungle.
I think, perhaps, you had better go to bed, Teddy. He and his friend want to get back to their hotel.
General Goethals, inspect the canal.
All right, Mister President, we go to Panama.
Bully, bully ! Follow me, General. He opens the door to the cellar, then turns toward Einstein, taps on the helmet Einstein is carrying and then on his own helmet.
It's down south, you know.
Oh !
Well, bon voyage !
Aunt Abby, I must correct your misapprehension. You talked of our hotel. We have no hotel. We came here directly.
This is not your home, and I'm afraid you can't stay here.
Doctor Einstein and I need a place to sleep. You remember that, as a boy, I could be disagreeable. It would not be pleasant for any of us if... but I don't have to go into details, do I ?
Perhaps we'd better let them stay here tonight.
Hey, Johnny, Johnny. Come here. Quick.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, Doctor Einstein and I are turning Grandfather's laboratory into an operating room. We expect to be very busy.
Hey, Johnny, down here, what do you think I find ?
What ?
The Panama Canal. And it just fits Mister Spenalzo. See the hole he's digging. Four feet wide, six feet long. He just fits ! You'd think he knew we were bringing Mister Spenalzo along. That's hospitality.
Rather a good joke on my aunts. They're living in a house with a body buried in the cellar. Einstein laughs.
Hey, how do we get him in here ?
Yes, we can't just walk Mister Spenalzo in through the door. We'll bring the car up between the cemetery and the house, and after they've gone to bed, we'll bring Mister Spenalzo in through the window.
Hey, Johnny...
We're moving the car behind the house. You'd better get to bed.
The car is all right where it is until morning.
I don't want to leave it in the street. That might be against the law.
Abby ! What are we going to do ?
Well, we're not going to let them spend more than one night in this house, for one thing. But what would the neighbors think ? People coming in here with one face and going out with another.
And what are we going to do about Mister Hoskins ?
Oh ! Mister Hoskins ! It can't be very comfortable for him in there. And he's been so patient, the poor dear. Well, I think Teddy had better take Mister Hoskins downstairs right away.
General Goethals was very pleased. He said the canal was just the right size. From the table, he picks up the book he had shown to Dr. Einstein, and starts looking at it.
Teddy ! Teddy, there's been another yellow-fever victim.
Dear me ! This will be a shock to the General.
No, Teddy, we must keep it a secret.
Yeah !
A state secret ?
Yes, a state secret.
Promised ?
You have the word of the President of the United States. Cross my heart and hope to die.
Now, let's see. How are we going to keep it a secret ?
Well, Teddy, I think you'd better get back down into the cellar. And then, when I turn out the lights, when everything's dark here, you come up and take the poor man down to the canal. Now get along, Teddy.
And we'll come down later and hold services.
Where is the poor devil ?
 In the window-seat.
It seems to be spreading. We've never had yellow fever there before.
Abby. I've never even seen Mister Hoskins !
Oh, my goodness! That's right, you were out. Well, you just come right along and see him now. You know, he's really very nice looking, considering that he's a Methodist.
We're bringing the luggage through here.
Jonathan, your room is waiting for you. You can go right up.
I'm afraid we don't keep Brooklyn hours. You two run along to bed.
Oh, but you must be very tired. Both of you. And we don't go to bed this early.
It's time I came home to take care of you. Behind Jonathan, Einstein has come into the room and is closing the window, and then the drapes.
 Take the bags upstairs.
For the instruments, I'll come back later.
Good night.
Now, we'll all go to bed.
I'll wait until you're up and then turn out the lights.
Run along, Aunt Martha. Just off the laboratory, Doctor.
All right, Aunt Abby.
I'll be right up.
Now, Aunt Abby ! Turn out the lights.
Aunt Abby.
He's all right, Johnny.
I'll open the window. You go round and hand him through.
But he's too heavy for me.
You go outside, Johnny, and push, and I'll stay here and pull. And then together we take him down to Panama. Huh ?
All right. We must be quick. I'll take a look around outside the house. When I tap on the glass, you open the window.
Yeah.
It's dark in here.
Where am I ? Oh, here I am.
Who left this open ?
Johnny ?
Okay, Johnny, wait a minute. Hand him over. Now I have him. Allez ! Up ! Now, wait a minute, Johnny. You lost a leg somewhere. Hey, help me. He's so heavy. Now I have him. Now I got him.
Be careful.
Oh, but his shoe came off. Help me, Johnny. He's so heavy. Now I've got him !
Hey, Johnny, somebody's at the door. Go open, quick. I'll manage Spenalzo. Go, quick !
Mortimer ! Aunt Abby !
 Aunt Martha !
 Who is it ? Is that you, Teddy ? JONATHAN Who are you ?
I'm Elaine Harper. I live next door.
What are you doing here ?
I came here to see my husband, Mortimer.
Why did you say your name was Harper ?
Well, it is Harper. I mean, it's Brewster. I'm not very used to it. I'm a brand-new Brewster.
Doctor !
It's all right, Johnny. It's okay.
 Maybe you'd better explain what you're doing here.
We happen to live here.
 You don't live here. I've been in this house every day, and I've never seen you before. Where are Miss Martha and Miss Abby ? What have you done to them ?
Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves. May I present Doctor Einstein ? He puts the shoe on the table, then lifts the tablecloth to look underneath it.
Doctor Einstein ?
A surgeon of great distinction. And something of a magician.
Now I suppose you're gonna tell me that you're Boris...
 I am Jonathan Brewster.
Oh ! You're Jonathan.
You've heard of me ?
Yes, they talk about you.
What do they say about me ?
Oh, just that there's another brother named Jonathan, that's all they say. Oh, that explains everything. Now that I know who you are, I'll just be running along, if you'll kindly unlock the door.
That explains everything. Just what do you mean by that ? Why do you come here at this time of night ?
Well, I just thought I saw Mortimer drive up. I suppose it was you.
You thought you saw someone drive up ?
You saw someone at the car ?
Yes.
What else did you see ?
Oh, just that, that's all !
I see. Is that why you came over here ?
Oh no, I came to see Mortimer. But if he's not home, I'll run...
You've given two names.
You're hurting me !
I think she's dangerous.
No visitors. It's going to be a private funeral.
Teddy ! Teddy, tell these men who I am !
Oh, that's my daughter, Alice.
Oh, no, Teddy ! Teddy !
Now, Alice, don't be a tomboy. Don't play rough with the gentlemen. He pulls out his imaginary sword and rushes up the stairs.
Charge !
Teddy !
Doctor, the cellar.
Let go of me ! Let go of me !
What's the matter ? What's happening down there ?
What's the matter ? What are you doing there ?
We caught a burglar, a sneak thief. Go back to your room.
We'll call the police.
I'll handle this. Go back to your room.
Do you hear me ?
Don't answer that.
Don't answer that !
Let go of me !
Where's Teddy ? Is he upstairs ?
Never mind that now, darling, please.
What are you doing with your best clothes on ?
Holy... What's that ? What's that thing there that looks like a cigar-store dummy ?
It's your brother Jonathan, and this is Doctor Einstein.
Aunt Abby, didn't I tell you not to let anybody in the house ? Who did you say it was ?
It's your brother, Jonathan !
I've come back home, Mortimer.
What ?
I've come back home, Mortimer.
I've come back home, Mortimer. Listen, it talks ! JONATHAN Yes, I talk. Mortimer, have you forgotten the things I used to do to you when you were tied to the bedpost ? The needles under your fingernails.
Mortimer, he...
Wait a minute.
Holy mackerel ! It is Jonathan !
I'm glad you remember, Mortimer.
Yeah, I remember. How could I forget you ? Where'd you get that face ? Hollywood ?
Oh, don't you two boys start quarreling again the minute you've seen each other.
We invited Jonathan and Doctor Einstein to stay.
What ?
Just for tonight.
Oh no, you don't, I'm staying here tonight. In fact, I'm staying here from now on.
Mortimer, what about me ?
There's no room for anybody else in the house.  Please, darling, just a moment.  So take that little squirt and beat it !  Now where's Teddy ? I've got to see him right away. Is he upstairs ? He starts climbing the stairs.
Mister Brewster ! We don't take up much room. Johnny can sleep on the sofa, and I'll sleep on the window-seat.
Nothing to...
Window-seat ?
Certainly not on the window-seat. I'm going to sleep on the window-seat.
I'm going to sleep on the windows-eat from now on.
Mortimer !
Now look. Now look, Jonathan. Now, be a good fellow. Here's ten dollars. Go out and haunt yourself a hotel.
Mortimer, you know what I do to people who order me around.
Hey, Johnny. Mister Spenalzo.
What ?
What's going to happen to Mister Spenalzo ?
We can't leave him here in the window-seat. Johnny ? JONATHAN Doctor, you know, Doctor, I've completely lost track of Mister Spenalzo.
Wait ! Who's this Mister Spenalzo ?
A friend of ours Johnny was looking for.
Don't you bring anyone else in here. Now, come on, beat it, both of you !
It's all right, Johnny. While we are packing, I'll tell you about him.
JONATHAN I'll take care of you, Mortimer, in just a little while.
How do you like that ? The guy stays away for twenty years and picks tonight of all nights to come back. Oh, Elaine, what are you doing here ?
Mortimer !
What's the matter, darling ?
I almost got killed.
Killed ? Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha !
Oh, no !
Oh, no ! It was Jonathan !
He mistook her for a sneak thief.
Oh, that.
ELAINE  It was worse than that. He's some kind of a maniac.
 I know, darling, I know.
 Oh, Mortimer, I'm afraid of him.
 Oh, darling, don't worry about it. I'm here now. Now forget it.
We were married today, we were going over Niagara Falls in a barrel, your brother tries to strangle me, a taxi's waiting, and now you want to sleep on a window-seat !
Window seat... Witherspoon. Darling, you'd better run along home.
What ?
Yes, yes. Go home like a good girl. I got things to do.
Mortimer ? But... but...
No, no, please.  Hello ? Operator ? Get me Happy Dale 2-7-0, please.
But, Mortimer, didn't you hear what I was just saying ?
Yes, 2-7-0.
Your own brother Jonathan, he was trying to strangle me ! MORTIMER Please ! This is important !
That ?
Hello ? Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon ? This is Mortimer Brewster.
Yes, Mr. Brewster, yes.
Well, I don't understand you. BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
 Look, look, I...
He was going to kill me !
 Wait a minute, I can't hear the man.  What ? I've got the papers all drawn up. I know it's late, but I want you to come down here and get my brother immediately ! I's got to be done.  Please, darling, please.
By the way, you've had the papers signed by your brother and the doctor, of course ?
Oh, the doctor ? Oh, holy mackerel ! I forgot the doctor ! Mortimer takes a piece of paper from the inside pockets of his jacket and puts it on the desk. Elaine is still whining at his side. ELAINE Mortimer !
 Please, be quiet ! Can't you see I've got to get a doctor ?  Hello ? What kind of a doctor ? A family doctor ?
You can take your honeymoon, your wedding ring, your taxi, your window-seat, and put them in a barrel, and push them all over Niagara Falls !
 Thank you, darling. Thank you.  Oh, look, why don't you come down here anyway ? While you're getting here, I'll get Teddy's and the doctor's signatures both.
Yeah. Elaine ! Elaine !  Yeah, I'll get both signatures. Yeah, well, come right away.
Elaine ? What's the matter with her ?
Oh, dear !
Elaine ! Elaine !
Elaine !
 Oh, let me sit down. Let me think about this thing. Doctor, Teddy, signature...
Hoskins !
Ye gods ! There's another one ! He closes the lid and walks across the room toward the kitchen door.
Aunt Abby ! Aunt Martha ! Come in here !
 We're busy.
No, you come in here now !
Yes, dear, what is it ? Where's Elaine ?
Wait a minute. Didn't you promise me not to let anyone in the house while I was gone ?
Jonathan just walked in.
I don't mean Jonathan !
And Doctor...
And I don't mean Doctor Einstein ! Who is that in the window-seat ?
We told you. Mister Hoskins.
He is not Mister Hoskins !
There !
Who can that be ?
You're trying to tell me you've never seen that man before ?
I certainly am. Well, this is a fine how-do-you-do ! It's getting so anyone thinks he can walk in this house !
Now, you look here, Aunt Abby. Don't you try to get out of this ! That's another one of your gentlemen, and you know it !
Mortimer, how can you say such a thing ? That man's an impostor. And if he came here to be buried in our cellar, he's mistaken.
You admitted to me you put Mister Hoskins in the window- seat.
Yes, I did.
Well, this man couldn't have got the idea from Mister Hoskins !
Oh, no.
By the way, where is Mister Hoskins ?
He must have gone to Panama.
What ? You buried him ?
No, no, not yet. He's just down there waiting for the services, poor dear. We haven't had a minute, what with Jonathan in the house.
Oh, dear. We've always wanted to hold a double funeral. But I will not read services over a total stranger !
A total stranger. Aunt Abby, how can I believe you ? There are twelve men down there, some you admit you poisoned them !
Yes, I did. But you don't think I'd stoop to telling a fib ! Martha ! She enters the kitchen.
Martha ! Martha ! What do you think has happened ?
A fib !
Jon... Oh-oh... Ah-ah...
This may interest you, Mortimer. I've decided that we're staying. And I've also decided that you're leaving, and I mean now.
Listen, handsome. I'm in no mood to debate the question. Are you getting out, or am I throwing you out on your ear?
I've led a strange life, Mortimer.
Martha, you come straight along here. You just look and see what's in that window-seat.
No. No, no, Aunt Abby, don't...
Jonathan, let Aunt Martha see what's in the window-seat.
Aunt Abby, darling, I owe you an apology.
I've got some very good news for you. Jonathan is leaving. And he's taking Doctor Einstein and that cold companion with him.  Listen, Jonathan. You're my brother, you're a Brewster. So, I'm giving you a chance to get away and take the evidence with you. You can't ask for more than that. Well ?
All right, in that case, I'll have to call the police.
Don't reach for the telephone. Remember, what happened to Mister Spenalzo can happen to you, too.
Spenalzo ?
I knew he was a foreigner.
Put down that telephone, Mortimer.
Oh...
Hello ! ABBY Oh, Officer O'Hara !
I saw the lights and thought you might have sickness in the house...
No...
Oh, you got company ? Oh, I'm sorry I disturbed you.
No ! Come in.
Yes, do come in. She closes the door behind him.
Come right in, Officer O'Hara. This is our nephew, Mortimer.
Oh, pleased to meet you.
And glad to see you, fellow.
And this is another nephew, Jonathan.
Pleased to make your acquaintance. Hey, your face is familiar. Haven't I seen a picture of you somewhere before ?
I don't think so.
I'll be running along.
Oh, come on. What's the hurry ? Why don't you stick around until my brother leaves.
I got to ring in, Mr. Brew... Say, you're not the Mortimer Brewster, the book-writer and the dramatic critic, are you ? MORTIMER Yes, why ?
Oh, what a break for me ! I'm a playwright.
No ?
I'm working on a play now.
You are ?
Yeah.
Well, well, well ! Maybe I can help you with it.
Oh, would you ? Oh, what a break ! I get wonderful ideas, but I can't spell them.
You can't ?... Oh, I can spell like the dickens. Constantinople ? Come on, come on, let's go into the kitchen.
All right.
You can tell me all about it.  Couldn't you whip up a sandwich for Officer O'Hara ?
I hope you don't mind eating in the kitchen, Officer O'Hara.
And where else would you eat ?
 See you in a moment.
Now, listen, Jonathan, this is your last chance. I'll keep O'Hara busy in the kitchen and give you a chance to get out. All three of you : you, Doctor Einstein and Spenalzo. JONATHAN Mortimer...
Now if you don't leave here in five minutes, I'll bring in Officer O'Hara, and introduce him to Mr. Spenalzo.
Mister Brewster, my play takes place in...
I'll be right with you, O'Hara. Right with you. Right with you. Just give me one moment.
Now get going ! All three of you.
Doctor, this affair between my brother and myself has got to be settled.
But, Johnny, we've got trouble enough as it is. Come, let's go.
We're not going. We're going to sleep right here in this house.
What ? With a cop in the kitchen and Spenalzo in the window-seat ?
That's all he's got on us. We'll take Spenalzo and dump him in the bay. After that, we're coming back here. Then if he tries to interfere...
No, no, Johnny. No, please.
Doctor, we've got a wonderful setup here. We can make a fortune. Two old ladies as a front. Only Mortimer stands in our way. I never did like Mortimer.
No, Johnny, please, take it easy. Please !
Doctor, you know when I make up my mind...
Yeah, I know, when you make up your mind, you lose your head. Look, Johnny, Brooklyn ain't a good setup for you.
Okay, Johnny. Okay !
Take the instruments and hide them in the cellar. Move fast. Einstein takes the suitcase and walks to the cellar. Jonathan opens the lid of the window-seat.
Mister Brewster, you don't know what goes on in Brooklyn.
Oh, I don't know.
No. My mother was an actress.
Oh ? Legitimate ?
Of course she was. She was my mother.
Oh, excuse me.
Peaches La Tour was her name.
Hey, Johnny, Johnny, come quick !
What's the matter ?
You know that hole in the cellar ?
Yes.
Well, we got an ace in the hole.
It's no fly-by-night idea. I've been working on this thing for twelve years.
Well, you have ?
Yeah.
Well, rehash it in your mind. I'll be back in a minute.
Oh, swell.
I like the first act.
But I didn't tell you the first act, Mister Brew... I...
No, I thought I told you... He closes the lid, kneels on the seat and looks through the open window.
Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan !
Yes, Mortimer.
What are you two doing still here ? I thought I told you to beat it.
We're not going. MORTIMER You're not going ?
No.
No.
You stay out of this. All right, you asked for it.
Officer O'Hara ?
 Coming.
Now, if you tell O'Hara what's in the window-seat, I'll tell him what's down in the cellar.
Cellar ?
There's an elderly gentleman down there who seems to be very dead.
What were you doing down the cellar ?
But what is he doing in the cellar ?
Now what are you going to tell O'Hara ?
Hey, your aunts heard my opening, it's swell. They want to hear the rest. Shall I bring them in here ?
No, no, no, no. You can't do that now. You'd better ring in.
Oh, the heck with ringing in ! You got me rolling now. I want to tell you the whole plot.
You know, you can't tell me in front of those two fellas, they wouldn't appreciate it.
Huh ? Hey, lowbrows, huh ?
Let's go some place we can be alone. I'll meet you there later.
Okay. Say ! How about the back room at Kelly's ?
Kelly's ?
Yeah.
Oh yeah, fine place for Bohemian atmosphere. Genius at work.
You ring in and I'll meet you at Kelly's.
Fine.
Fine.
Why don't you both go down in the cellar ? O'HARA That's all right with me.
No, no, no. There's a much more literary atmosphere in Kelly's, I assure you.
Okay.
We'll meet later
This opening will kill you.
You will.
I'm waiting to be born, you see, and the doctor comes in...
Oh, the doctor !
Yeah !
Yeah. Now, Look, you ring in and I'll see you later.
Okay. You won't stand me up, will you, Mister Brewster ?
No.
This is a great play, you'll like it. I'll see you down there.
Can't wait ! Can't wait !
Doctor, doctor. Where are those papers ? Oh, there they are.
Oh, oh-oh ! You're smug, aren't you? You think you've got it over me. But you haven't. You think I'm afraid to go to the police about Spenalzo because you've got hold of Hoskins. Well, I'm not !
The moment I get Spenalzo... I mean, the moment the doctor signs this, I don't care who knows about him, Hoskins, I mean. And you better feel the same way about Spenalzo. Yes, Spenalzo !
Where are you going ?
To the Doctor. Where do you... Oh ! Mortimer stops and starts running downstairs, and then to the front door.
When I come back, I expect to find you gone. Wait for me !
We'll wait for him.
Did he look guilty !
Well, Martha, I think we can start the services now.
Oh ! We thought we heard you leave.
Perish the thought, dear aunties. That was just Mortimer. And speaking of services, Aunt Martha, will you make us some coffee while we take Mister Spenalzo down to the cellar ?
Oh, no. No, Jonathan. You've got to take him with you !
There's a friend of Mortimer's downstairs waiting for him.
A friend of Mortimer's ?
Take his feet, Doctor. Mister Spenalzo and he will get along fine together. They're both dead.
Oh ! He must mean Mister Hoskins.
Mister Hoskins ?
You know about what's down there ? ABBY Of course we do. And he's no friend of Mortimer's. He's one of our gentlemen.
Your gentlemen ?
Yes. And we won't have any strangers buried in our cellar.
But Mister Hoskins ?
Mister Hoskins is no stranger.
Besides, there's no room for Mister Spenalzo. The cellar's crowded already.
Crowded ? With what ?
There are twelve graves down there now.
Twelve graves.
That leaves very little room and we're going to need it.
You mean that you and Aunt Martha have murdered twelve... ABBY Murdered ? Certainly not. It's one of our charities.
Why, what we've been doing is a mercy.
So you just take your Mister Spenalzo out of here.
You've done all that right here in this house and buried them in the cellar ?
That's wonderful, Johnny !
We've been chased all over the world, and they stay right here in Brooklyn, and they do just as good as you do.
What ?
Yeah. You got twelve, they got twelve.
I've got thirteen.
No, Johnny, twelve. Don't brag.
Thirteen.
There's Mister Spenalzo. Then the first one in London.
Yeah.
Two in Johannesburg, one in Sydney, one in Melbourne, two in San Francisco, one in Phoenix, Arizona.
Phoenix ?
The filling station. DOCTOR EINSTEIN Filling st... Oh, yes.
Three in Chicago and one in South Bend. That makes thirteen.
You cannot count the one in South Bend. He died of pneumonia.
He wouldn't have died of pneumonia if I hadn't shot him.
No, no, Johnny, you cannot count him. You got twelve, they got twelve. The old ladies is just as good as you are.
They are, are they ? That's easily taken care of. All I need is one more. That's all. Just one more. And I've a pretty good idea who it is.
I'm a very lucky man to have caught you at home, Doctor Gilchrist.
This is most irregular, most irregular.
I'm sorry to have dragged you out of bed, but, you see, you're the only one who can help me.
I know Teddy blows bugles, but I can't commit a man to an institution just on that.
Oh, well, if only you had a little talk with him, I assure you you'd be convinced by him. Here's the house I...
There goes Hoskins. DOCTOR GILCHRIST Who ?
What ? What ? Did I say... Oh, I...
Now, you better wait.
Here ?
Yes, I'll bring Teddy out. Well, you see, I wouldn't want to alarm the old ladies, you know, seeing a doctor and everything. You wait here, huh ? He helps him finish tying his necktie.
In the cemetery ?
Yeah, that'll be good.
It's Halloween.
Oh, don't worry about that. At Halloween, the pixies won't be out till after midnight. Now look, you wait here. Make yourself comfortable. Pull up a tombstone. I'll be right back.
Hey, 22.50 !
What ?
22.50 !
Oh, yes, looks good on you !
Yeah ! Not the suit, the meter ! Looks good on me. 22.50 !
Did you give him a twenty-one-gun salute ?
Yes, with a Maxim silencer.
Hey, you. Five more bucks and you'll own it.
Oh no, thanks. It wouldn't fit me.
Oh, Mister President, may I have the pleasure...
Doctor Livingstone !
Livingstone ?
 Well, that's what he presumes.  Mister President, the doctor would like to have a few words with you in private.
Certainly. Welcome to Washington, doctor.
Arlington is beautiful at this time of year, is it not, doctor ?
Yes, indeed. The doctor looks back at Mortimer, seeming a little frightened. Mortimer remains alone, with the papers in his hand. We still hear the hymns sung by the Brewster sisters in the background.
Well now, that's that. It gives me a chance to rest.
Well, so far, so good.
Not so good.
Do you or do you not love me ?
Oh, Elaine. Elaine, how can you say such a thing ? Darling, of course I love you.
Do you ?
Yes, darling.
Hey, then why have you been treating me the way you have ?
Oh, Elaine.
Elaine, Elaine, darling, I love you so much, I can't go through with our marriage.
Have you suddenly gone crazy ?
No, no, I don't think so, but it's only a matter of time. Now, look, darling, you wouldn't want to have children with three heads, would you ? I mean, you wouldn't want to set up housekeeping in a padded cell.
What are you talking about ?
Well, I don't quite know really. Look, I probably should have told you this before, but you see... well, insanity runs in my family.
It practically gallops.
Oh, darling, just because Teddy's a little strange, that doesn't mean...
Oh no, darling, no, no. It's way back before Teddy. No, this goes back to the first Brewster, the one who came over on the Mayflower. Yeah. You know, you know how in those days the Indians used to scalp the settlers ? Well, he used to scalp the Indians.
Darling, that's ancient history.
Yes, Doctor, I'll run for a third term, but I won't be elected. And that'll mean the last of the Roosevelts in the White House.
That's what you think.
Of course, if the country insists...
Oh, darling, all this doesn't prove a thing. Look at your aunts. They're Brewsters, aren't they ? They're the sweetest, sanest people I've ever known.
Yeah.
Well, even they have their peculiarities.
What of it ? So your family's crazy. So you're crazy. That's the way I want you, the way I love you. I'm crazy too, but kiss me.
No, no. I... Ohhh !
Goodbye, Ambassador. I've enjoyed this little talk very much. Anytime you're in Washington, drop in to see me at the White House.
Those papers. Those papers.
Go away.
Oh, papers ! Papers ! Yes.
I'll enjoy committing him to any place.
You will ?
I've just been appointed Ambassador to Bolivia !
Ah, you see ? Didn't I tell you ?
No. Don't worry about that. Just go on signing the papers. Oh dear. Thank you.
Okay, thank you.
All right ! All right ! We'll find out whose house this is ! I'm warning you, you better stop it. There's no use doing what you're doing, because it'll just have to be undone.
 Aunt Abby, go to bed !
It's a terrible thing to do to bury a good Methodist with a foreigner.
Hello.
Mortimer, where have you been ?
Uh-uh ? Oh, I was getting some papers signed. Is Teddy in his room ?
Oh, Mortimer, what is the matter with you ? Running around getting papers signed at a time like this.
Martha and I are going for the police.
Police ! He quickly get back downstairs
Oh-oh-oh ! Wait-wait-wait ! You can't go for the police.
Oh, no ? You know what Jonathan's doing ?
He's putting Mister Hoskins and Mister Spenalzo in together.
Oh, darling, let him.
This is all fixed up nice now. Nice and smooth like a lake. The President will be very proud of his Panama Canal.
Oh, Johnny, bed feels good already. You know, we didn't get any sleep for forty-eight hours.
You're forgetting, Doctor.
What ?
Now, look. If Jonathan and Mister Spenalzo aren't out this house before morning, we're going for the police.
Yeah, but I'll get them out, I promise you that !
Then you get the wedding silver.
Yes, but remember, no police ! No police ! All right.
There's a thing. Look, go to bed, will you ? Fine. Get out of those clothes ! You two look like a double blackout.
My brother, Mortimer.
I just heard him upstairs.
No, no, no ! I am tired. You forget, I got to operate on your face tomorrow. He sits down on the bottom steps of the stairs.
 You are going to operate tomorrow, Doctor. But tonight we are taking care of Mortimer.
No, but Johnny, not tonight ! I'm sleepy. We'll do it tomorrow. Or the next day.
 Look at me, Doctor. You can see that it's got to be done, can't you?
Yeah, I know that look.
 It's a little late to dissolve our partnership.
Okay, okay, Johnny, okay. We'll do it. But the quick way, huh ? The quick twist like in London.
 No, Doctor. I think this calls for something special. I think, perhaps, the Melbourne method.
Not the Melbourne method, please ! Two hours ! And then when it was all over, what ? The fellow in London was just as dead as the fellow in Melbourne.
No, no, no. Don't do that, Mister President.
But I cannot sign any proclamation without consulting my Cabinet.
This must be secret.
A secret proclamation ? How unusual.
Yes, it's the only way we can outsmart the other fellow.
Who's the other fellow ?
That's the secret.
Oh, I see ! Very clever. Well, if it's a a secret proclamation, it has to be signed in secret.
Of course, Mister President.
I'll have to put on my signing clothes.
Oh, you already have them on, Mister President.
So I have. Wait here.
Hey, Mister Brewster.
Yes, what is it ? Mice ?
Hey, Mister Brewster, you get out of this house.
Can't you see I'm busy ?
 Ta-ta-ta taaa !
Thank you, Mister President. Oh, what a load off my mind. Boy, could I use a drink ! Thank God for that.
 Get out of here, will you, please ?
Huh ? What did you say ? Speak up, sonny. I can't hear you.
 Johnny's in a bad mood. You get out of here !
Stop underplaying. I can't hear you.
Please listen to me. Get out.
Stop all this ! What are you doing ? Look, Doc. Are you really a doctor ?
Yes, Heidelberg, 1919. You go... He takes his sleeve again and tries to move him to the front door.
Heidelberg ? How'd you... How'd you come to hook up with Jonathan ?
I tell you later about that, but you go now. Please listen to me.
Tch-tch-tch ! Stop it, Doctor, now stop it !
You get out of here ! Look, look, when Johnny's in that mood, he's a madman. He's a maniac ! And then things happen. Horrible things.
You get out of here !
Will you stop it ? Now look, stop telling me about Jonathan, I'll take care of Jonathan, and you take care of yourself. Now, get going, little fellow.
What's that ? What's that ? Wait a minute.
Oh no ! My schnapps !
I could use that. I could use that.
That's mine.
Please. Only for dramatic critics. Now look, you beat it before things start popping around here.
But, look, Mr. Brewster, please. You've just been married. You have a nice little wife waiting for you. Please go now. Please.
Tell me, don't those plays you see all the time teach you anything ?
Oh, stop it, don't get me on the subject of plays ! I've got a lot on my mind now. I've got to wait here for Mister Witherspoon.
At least people in plays act like they got sense.
Oh, you think so ? Did you ever see anybody in a play ever act like they got intelligence ?
How can somebody be so stupid ?
You ought to have my job a few nights. Listen to me, brother. When you get out of prison, you have yourself wheeled over to the Garrick Theater. Oh ! Oh ! There's a play there that's been running so bad that it'll still be running when you get out. Now, in this, there's a man... Now listen to this...
Now, he knows he's in the house with murderers. So he ought to know he's in danger. He's even been warned to get out of the house. And does he go ?
Yes.
No, he doesn't. He stays ! This fellow doesn't even have sense to be scared or to be on his guard. No, no. The murderer even invites him to sit down. What do you think he does ?
Well, I don't know. MORTIMER He sits down ! I remember what he did. He deliberately pulls up a chair like that and he sits down in it.
Isn't that great ? So there he is, all waiting to be trussed up and gagged. What do you think they used to truss him up with ?
 Oh, what ?
 The curtain cord.
Curtain cord ? But didn't he see him get it ?
Seen him get it. No. The silly chump sits down with his back toward the murderer.
All he has to do is look around, but does he ? No !
 No... Look, you see, brother Heidelberg, in a play or even in a movie, for that matter, ...a fellow never sees or hears anything. No. That's right.
But what does he do ?
Oh, what does he do ? Well, the big chump sits there. This fellow's supposed to be bright. He sits there.
Now get a load of this. Look, look at the attitude. Large as life ! He sits there waiting to be tied up and gagged. The big dope !
You were right about that fellow. He wasn't very bright.
Yes, Mortimer. I've been away for twenty years. But never, my dear brother, were you out of my mind.
In Melbourne one night, I dreamt of you.
The more you struggle, Mortimer, the more you strangle yourself. Later on, you may consider that a blessing.
Now, Doctor, we go to work.
Johnny, for me, please, the quick way. Please.
Doctor, this must be an artistic achievement.
Please.
After all, we're performing before a very distinguished critic.
Johnny, please !
Doctor !
All right. Let's get it over with. No, but, Johnny, I cannot see this without a drink.
Pull yourself together, Doctor.
But I can't pull myself together without a drink. Johnny, you remember when we came in here, there was some wine. And then they took it. Where did they put it ?
Johnny, I found some wine. I found some wine.
Here, I'll split it with you. We both have a drink before we operate. Oh, I am so happy that we don't have to operate without a drink.
Doctor. One moment, please. Where are your manners ?  Yes, Mortimer. I realize now that it was you who brought me back to Brooklyn. We drink to you. Doctor ! To my dear, dead brother.
Prosit !
That idiot ! He goes next. That's all. He goes next !
Not Teddy ! Not Teddy ! Please !
We'll get to him later.
Not Teddy, we won't get to him at all !
Now, we have to work fast. The quick way.
Oh, the quick way, oh yes ! If it has to be, then the quick way. Yes, I'll help you with it.
Hey, the colonel has to quit blowing that horn. JONATHAN It's all right, Officer. We're taking the bugle away from him.
I'd better talk to him myself. Where's the lights ?
Hey ! You stood me up ! I've been waiting for you for over an hour at Kelly's. What happened to him ?
Nothing. He was explaining a play he saw the other night and that's what happened to a poor man in the play. He walks away with his jacket in his hands.
Oh, I see. Did that really happen in a play you saw ? How do you like that ? You can't trust nobody no more. They practically stole that from the second act of my play. You know, in the second act, just... Well, maybe I'd better start at the beginning.
Huh ? Oh, yes, sure.
Nooo ! You've got to hear the plot !
My mother's sitting there, making up, see. And, like a flash, suddenly, out of a clear sky, the door comes open and a man with a black mustache comes in.
He turns to my mother and he says, Miss Peaches La Tour, will you marry me ? That's the first scene. My mother doesn't tell him they're married. That's the surprise !
Oh, What a kick ! All right. Twenty-five years pass. Well, in the meantime, there's me. Growing into a magnificent specimen. So what do I do ? I join the police force and become one of New York's finest. Well, I'm cleaning out a crooked laundry, see ?
Little do I know it, but there is a dope fiend with a long knife crawling after me. I'm in great danger. It's getting you, ain't it ? I can see it in your eyes.
Well, you ain't heard nothing yet.
All of a sudden, a fire breaks out. What an effect ! The firemen rush in and who do you think is leading them ? Mayor Fiorello La Guardia !
What's the matter with him ?
Yeah, probably your play put him to sleep.
What ?
I personally, I like it very much.
It's probably over his head, huh ?
Yeah. O'Hara looks at Jonathan's face.
Where have I seen that face before ?
No, please.
Well, the scene changes. It's an evolving stage. I'm walking along my beat, well, like that, casual-like, when a guy that I'm following, it turns out he's really following me !
 Don't let nobody in.  I figure I'll outsmart him. There's a vacant house on the corner.
Hey, Johnny, the cops !
So, I ducks in there. I sees the door handle turn, so I pulls out my gun, braces myself against the wall and I says : Come in !
Oh, hello, boys.
What the Sam Hill's going on here ?
Hello Sarge, what do you think, this is Mortimer Brewster. He's going to help me write my play.
Do you have to tie him up to make him listen ?
O'Hara, you better report in the station. Why didn't you ring in ? You got the whole force out looking for you.
Right in the middle of the second act. Did they send you guys here looking for me ?
No, we came to warn the old ladies. There is a difficulty. The colonel blew that bugle again.
Yeah, I heard him.
The neighbors are all phoning in. The Lieutenant's on the warpath. He says we've got to put him away someplace.
Now, who the heck is this ?
Oh, that's Mister Brewster's brother. My play put him to sleep.
Oh ! That's the one that ran away. So he came back.  Brophy. Get me Mac.  Haven't you got yourself in a mess ! You're two hours overdue at the station. I better let them know that I found you.
Hey ! It wasn't that bad, was it ?
 Mac ? Tell the Lieutenant he can call off the big manhunt. We found him... At the Brewster house... Shall we bring him in ?... All right, we'll hold him right here.
The Lieutenant is on his way over. JONATHAN So I've been turned in, hey ? All right, you've got me. I suppose you and my stool-pigeon brother will split the reward.
Yes, reward ! Now I'll do some turning in !
 Oh, wait a minute, Mr. Brewster.
You think my aunts are sweet, charming old ladies, don't you ? Well, there's thirteen bodies buried in the cellar ! Yes, thirteen.
Be careful what you say about your aunts, they happen to be friends of ours.
I'll show them to you.
Don't you make any trouble for them, do you hear me !
 Never mind, Mr. Brewster. Leave him to me, I'll take care of him.
 You come down to the cellar.
 Now, wait a minute.
Thirteen bodies. I'll show you where they're buried.
Oh, yeah !
Go down to the cellar with him, O'Hara.
Yes, come to the cellar.
Well, look, do I have to ?
Sorry, maybe I don't want to go down to the cellar with him.
O'Hara, go on down the cellar with him !
Now, please, Mister Brewster. I'll tell you the rest of my play later.
Go on down to the cellar with him.
Gee, do I have to, Sarge ? Look at that puss. He looks like Boris Karloff.
 Don't !  Sarge !
 Look out, Pat !... Look out, Pat !
 He's got a gun...
 I got him, Pat. Look out !
Fight. Go on and fight.
That's enough, that's enough. Everybody off.
 Pat ! Pat, look out!
Amazing... Such a fine day, too. All I did was cross the bridge and I was in Brooklyn. Amazing. Amazing, amazing.
Don't... Don't bother me now.
Buddy, you could use this in the third act.
Oh yes, I got something better than this. Let me tell you...
I'll see you later.
I got the papers signed. There, they're all signed. What do I care ? Go ahead, go ahead, fight, fight, fight-fight- fight !
I'd better call up and see if Witherspoon has left.
Telephone. Hey !
I'll get every one of you ! I hate cops. I'll brain the first one that comes near me !
Yeah. A little higher, please, brother.
Thank you very much. Yeah, that's fine. Jonathan suddenly realizes what Mortimer is doing and turns his head toward him. Brophy immediately comes behind him and hits him with his stick. Jonathan starts falling, and Mortimer has to pick up the telephone not to loose it.
Oh ! Don't do that, please.
Get him, Pat.
 Come on, doc...  That won't have any effect. I've tried it before...
Oh, it did. Dear me ! Isn't that amazing ?
Oh, dear. Wish I could relax like that.
Witherspoon !
Come in.
What has occurred ?
Never mind ! Didn't I tell you I'd handle this myself ?
Well, Lieutenant ! We were just acting in self-defense.
 What happened ? He put up a fight ?
This isn't the one who blows the bugle. This is his brother. He tried to kill O'Hara.
All I said was he looked like Boris Karloff.
Boris ?... Turn him over.
Kind of think he's wanted somewhere. Rooney stands up and looks at Brophy with an ironical smile.
Oh ! You kind of think he's wanted somewhere ? If you guys can't look at the circulars we put up in the station, you can at least read short detective stories. Certainly, he's wanted somewhere. In Indiana ! He escaped from the prison for criminally insane. He's a lifer.
That's my brother !
For Pete's sake, that's the way they described him. He looked like Karloff. Why'd you have to knock him off ?
He tried to get us to go down to the cellar. He says there are thirteen bodies buried down there.
Thirteen bodies buried in the cellar, and that don't tip you off the guy's come from a nuthouse ?
Thanks, pal.
Say, lieutenant, about my not ringing in, I want to explain...
Where have you been all night ? Don't bother to tell me.
Oh, I was right here writing a play with Mortimer Brewster.
Yeah ?
Yeah.
Well, you're going to have a long time on that play.
Yeah ?
You're suspended. Now go on. Report in.
 Take this guy out in the kitchen and bring a pillow. I want to find out where his accomplice is.
 What is the meaning of this commotion ?
The guy who helped him escape. He's wanted, too.
Here.
Forty-eight hours I've been after these guys. Nothing to eat. No sleep. No wonder Brooklyn's in the shape it's in. With flatheads like you on the force. Falling for a story like that ! Thirteen bodies buried down in the cellar.
But there are thirteen bodies in the cellar !
Who are you ?
I'm President Roosevelt.
 What the blazes is this ?
He's the guy that blows the bugle. SAUNDERS Howdy, Colonel.
Well, Colonel, you've blown your last bugle.  Come on, get this guy out of here.
Dear me ! Another yellow-fever victim ?
What ?
All the bodies in the cellar are yellow-fever victims. BROPHY No-no-no, Colonel. This is a spy. We caught him at the White House.
Take him out and bring him to. I want to question him.
If there is any questioning of spies, that's my department.
Hey, you, keep out of that.
You're forgetting that as President, I am also head of the Secret Service.
Huh-huh-huh !
Who are you ? What's your name ?
Usually, I'm Mortimer Brewster. But I'm not quite myself today.
Oh, you're his brother. Now, look, Mister Brewster, no argument. He's got to be put away.
No, no, no arguments, Captain. No arguments. Just a minute, take it easy. Read this.
Teddy's going to go to Happy Dale tonight. I'm just waiting here for Mr. Witherspoon.
Well, as long as he's going someplace. He's scaring the neighbors, what with that bugle and all. And that cockeyed story about thirteen bodies being buried... Rooney stops, looks around with a suspicious eye and takes his hat off.
You know, I've been without sleep for forty-eight hours. I'm liable to think anything.
I know just how you feel.
There's people dumb enough to believe a story like that. Last year there was a crazy guy, started a murder rumor. I had to dig up a half acre plot before I could prove... Ohh ! What's this ?
What's the matter ?
These papers are no good.
Why not ?
He signed it Theodore Roosevelt !
He what ?...
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
Is your cab engaged ?
Yeah ! I'm losing dough every minute. Got me offers ?
I'm Mister Witherspoon of Happy Dale Sanitarium, I have come here to collect a Brewster. I would like you to drive us back to the sanitarium.
I knew this would end up in a nuthouse ! Witherspoon comes back a few steps.
We like to think of it as a rest home.
Mister Brewster ? Mister Brewster ?
Mr. Witherspoon is here.
Supposing the spy steals this document and finds the name Theodore Roosevelt on it. Think what that would mean to the safety of the nation !
No, it's chicanery.
Oh, wasting the time.
He's come to. He's ready to talk.
Hold him till I get there.
Yes, sir.
Let me explain. The name Brewster is code for Roosevelt.
Code for Roosevelt ?
Yes, don't you see ? Take the name Brewster. Take away the B and what have you got ? TEDDY Rooster.
And what does a rooster do ?
Crows.
It crows! And where are you hunting in Africa ?
On the veldt !
There you are ! Crowsveldt.
Ingenious ! My compliments to the boys in the code department.
Hey, that's all right ! Do that again for me.
Never mind ! Give me that pen. This is fun.
Now, now, all I got to get is Witherspoon.
MORTIMER Oh ! Oh ! Mister Witherspoon, I can't tell you how glad I am to see you. Mister Witherspoon... Before... Look... You will take good care of Teddy at Happy Dale ?
Best of care of him, Mister Brewster.
Oh, that's fine. And no wagon when he leaves.
Why ? To take him away ? Oh, never, never. Taxicabs. We always... I have one waiting now.
Yes, look, it means a great deal to me. You will personally see that Teddy's happy at Happy Dale ?
He'll be very happy at Happy Dale. MORTIMER Oh, that's good.
You know, I sometimes envy some of our patients, secretly, you know.
Oh, you do ? It must be a nice place. Because I've never been to Happy Dale.
You never can tell.
Oh, this is a particularly happy moment for me tonight, Mister... Mister Brewster. Yes, I've never met a dramatic critic and I had been so anxious to.
Oh, the woods are full of them.
I have here something that will explain what we're trying to do out there at Happy Dale.
Oh ! A pamphlet about Happy Dale ?
Oh, no-no, it's a play. Something I've been working on for some time now. When Mortimer sees Witherspoon flipping the pages of his booklet, a slightly frightened look comes to his face.
It's a dramatization of many of the little incidents that have happened here at Happy Dale.
Captain ! Captain !... Captain !
Now, I want you to read this very carefully. I want you to be just as harsh as you like. I shan't mind, you know...
Captain, this is Mister Witherspoon. Witherspoon looks at Rooney with a smile.
Oh, yes, yes, he'll be very happy at Happy Dale. Come, my boy.
What is this?
No, no, no-no, Mister Witherspoon, you got it wrong. This is... this is Captain Rooney.
The police ?... Oh !
I'm sure! Here are the papers, all signed. Now you can take him away, Super.
I'll be in my office vetoing some bills.
Mister President, I have good news for you. Your term of office is over.
Is this March the four ? MORTIMER Practically.
Let's see... Oh ! Now I go on my hunting trip to Africa ! Well, I must get started immediately.
Is he trying to move into the White House before I've moved out ?
Who, Mister President ?
Taft ! MORTIMER No, no, Teddy this isn't Mister Taft. It's Mister Witherspoon, he's going to be your guide to Africa.
Bully ! Bully ! Wait right here. I'll bring down my equipment.
Happy man.
Goodbye, Aunt Abby, goodbye Aunt Martha. I'm on my way to Africa. Isn't it wonderful ?
Charge !
It's all right, Aunt Abby, I've got it.
Oh, dear. And Happy Dale is full of staircases.
You've come to meet Teddy, haven't you ?
 No, he's come to take him. Teddy's been blowing his bugle again.
Oh, no-no, no, he can't go now ! We won't permit it.
We promise to take his bugle away from him. We won't be separated from Teddy.
I'm sorry.
Mortimer, how can you allow this ? You promised.
Mister Brewster's got nothing to do with this, see. The law is the law ! Teddy's committed himself and he's got to go.
Well, if he's going, we're going, too !
Yes, you'll have to take us with him.
Why-why... why not ? Why not, indeed ?
Oh well now, indeed, it's sweet of them to want to go, but it's quite impossible. We never take sane people at Happy Dale.
Oh, no-no-no-no... MORTIMER  Now, these two little sane people, mixed up with all the others, will get lost in the shuffle. You could arrange that.
Oh, no-no-no-no...
Just put them in and they'll get all mixed up.
Oh, no ! No, no ! No ! Too dangerous. Dissension, jealousy.
 Now, let's be sensible, ladies...
...Here I am wasting my time when I could be doing some serious work. You know, ladies, there are still murders to be solved in Brooklyn. It ain't only his bugle blowing, and neighbors being afraid of him. But things are going to get worse. We're liable to have to dig up your cellar.
Our cellar ?
Yeah.
Oh-oh !
Yeah, Teddy's been telling around there's thirteen bodies buried in the cellar.
But there are thirteen bodies in our cellar.
What ?
Yes. You just ask our nephew, Mortimer.
Charge !
 Isn't that amazing ?
Now, Mortimer, you behave yourself. You know very well there are thirteen bodies down in our cellar.
Certainly there's thirteen bodies down in the cellar. And there are hundreds more up in the attic, Captain !
What is this ?
You mustn't mind Mortimer.
How about it, lieutenant ?
I'll be right there.
He's been a little strange all day.
Well, right now I wouldn't know what is and what ain't strange anymore. I'll better have a look in that cellar.
I'll tell you what we'll do, Captain. I'll bring my bodies down from the attic and you get yours down from the cellar, and we'll get them all together, and we'll send them to Happy Dale.
No, no, you wouldn't have to dig. The graves are all marked. We put flowers on them every Sunday.
Flowers ?
Sure, I put neon lights on mine.
Humor them, humor them. Smile.
What ?
There's one down there, a Mister Spenalzo...
 Hasn't got it yet.
...who doesn't belong here and who's going to have to leave.
But the other twelve are our gentlemen.
Your gentlemen ?
Oh, you'd like mine better. None of mine are gentlemen.
You mustn't mind him at all. He got married today.
 There is a Happy Dale far, far away. There is a Happy"
 Yeah, yeah.
He got it. It's amazing.
 Look, Super, don't you think you can find room for the ladies ?
Just the ladies ?
Just the ladies, not me !
How about it, Super ?
Well, of course, they'd have to be committed.
Well, Teddy committed himself. Couldn't they commit themselves also ? All they have to do is sign the papers.
Certainly.
Oh well, if we can go with Teddy, we'll sign the papers. Where are they ?
I have them, ladies, I have them right here.
 Sign them up, will you, Super ? I want this all cleaned up. I'm going out to talk to that spy. Maybe I can understand him. Thirteen bodies down in the cellar.
Ladies, if you will sign right here.
 Right here ?
 Yes, please. It's on the right-hand side right there.
I'm really looking forward to going. The neighborhood here has changed so.
Yes. Especially since they won that old pennant thing.
Oh... oh, dear, I'm so sorry. We've overlooked something. It's absolutely compulsory that we have the signature of a physician.
A doctor... Oh ! Doctor Einstein ! Come here and sign some papers, please.
Good night.
Come here, Doctor Einstein.
A doctor ?
Oh, yes, yes. Doctor Einstein almost operated on me earlier this evening. Come on, Doctor.
Here. Just sign right here, please, Doctor. Einstein signs the paper Mortimer gives him. Meanwhile, Rooney and Saunders are coming out of the kitchen and crossing the room.
Were you leaving, Doctor ?
Yes, please.
Oh ! Aren't you going to wait for Jonathan ?
I don't think we go to the same place.
 Hello, Mac. We picked up that guy that's wanted in Indiana. His accomplice's description is one on the circular, on the desk. Read it to me, will you ?
 Yeah... About forty... Five-foot-three... One hundred and forty pounds... Pop eyes... Talks with a German accent... Poses as a doctor... Okay, Mac. Thanks.
It's all right, Lieutenant Rooney. The doctor here has completed the signatures.
Oh, that's great ! Thanks, Doc. You've done Brooklyn a great service.
But Dr. Einstein !
 Now, Mister Witherspoon...
No, no, you're Mister Witherspoon, I'm Mister Brewster. WITHERSPOON  It's contagious, yes. It's your turn.
Now, don't play games...
You sign. You sign as next of kin.
Oh, next of kin. Why didn't you say so ? I'm all confused. Don't mind me.
Mr. Witherport.
Spoon. Mortimer picks up a spoon on the table and gives it to Witherspoon.
Oh, here it is.
Come up and pack my duffel.
Duffel ?
Yes, duffel. Pack his duffel. He's President, you know ?
Oh !
And bring along my bugle.
President.
Don't charge !
Mortimer. Mortimer, we're really very worried about something.
Oh, now, darling, don't be worried.
Me too, Mortimer.
Well, of course, darling.
You'll both are going to be very happy at Happy Dale, will you.
Oh yes, dear, we're very happy about the whole thing, but that's just it. We don't want anything to go wrong.
Well, what would go wrong ?
Mortimer, will they investigate those signatures ?
Oh, no, they won't look up Dr. Einstein...
But it's not his signature, dear. It's yours.
Mine ?
You see, you signed as next of kin.
Oh, what's wrong about that, darling ?
Well... Martha, you tell him now.
Well, dear.
What, dear ?
You're not really a Brewster.
Your mother came to us as a cook. And you were born about three months afterwards. And she was such a sweet woman and such a good cook, we didn't want to lose her. So brother married her. Your real father was a cook, too. He was a chef on a tramp steamer.
You mean... you mean I'm not really a Brewster ?... Oh !
Oh, darling ! Don't feel so badly about it.
I'm sure it won't make any difference to Elaine.
Elaine ! Elaine ! Where are you ? Can you hear me ? I'm not really a Brewster ! I'm the son of a sea cook !
Mortimer ! Mortimer ! Mortimer ! It's true ! It's true ! I saw them. Mortimer, it's true.
It's true ! There are thirteen bodies down there !
 But I saw them
What's all this screaming about ?
 But I saw them...
It's way past her bedtime. With his mouth still pressed on her, he lifts her and carries her across the room to the front door.
Quiet !
But, Mortimer...
Goodbye !
Bye.
Goodbye, darling !
What is all this ?
They're going on their honeymoon.
Well, they're off to a flying start.
 I pull my gun at...
Hey !
What ?
I really did see...
Hey ! You'll own two cabs !
Huh ?
I mean the meter !
Oh, Mortimer.
 Oh, Mortimer.
 Oh, we're going to Niagara Falls. Call me a cab, dear.
Yes, love.
But, Mister Brewster !
No, no, I'm not a Brewster. I'm a son of a sea cook.
Charge !
I'm not a cabdriver. I'm a coffeepot !
