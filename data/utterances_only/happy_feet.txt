Like you're no-one, cos the world is full of us, and everyone's the same
How do you stand out from the crowd? How do you find someone special?
I know. I know. "You sing your heart out." That's how mum found dad in the first place
 "Babe...I got you Babe..."
 "When a man loves a woman..."
"Love me tender love me true, all my dreams fulfil.
With them it was love at first song.
But with me everything was a different, right from the moment I was born
First rule of survival: get yourself laid before winter.
Apparently I only just made it.
Afterwards Mum went off to the sea to keep warm. Dad stayed home like dad's do, incubating.
Safe home baby....
I'll miss you.
Tell me what it is about the cold and the dark. Soon as the sun goes away, everyone gets religious
When all others leave...
We Remain.
When the Sun vanishes...
We Remain.
Deny the pangs of hunger. Seal the gaps. Share the warmth....
Caruso's the leader because he's so incredibly old. Some say more than 40, but you know how penguins exaggerate.
....Each one taking his turn to defy the wind.
...As we invoke the Great One, Penguin of Penguins
 OK. Invoke. But keep moving
My dad was never that devout. Often his mind was on other stuff.
 "I wanna be loved by you, alone and nobody else by you boo boo pee doo"
Amen to that honey
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, pal! Ya lettin' out the heat!
...Quit shovin'! ...Hey watch where you're putting your feet
Brothers, BROTHERS! The Devotions!
Oh no! I dropped it! Where's my egg!
S'okay. S'okay. No harm done.
I guess he was wrong about a lot of things.
But I did learnt this from him:    the power of positive thinking
By the power of our Devotions...
We turn the world once more.
By our devotion to the Wisdoms
We bring back the sun.
...It's   a   boy! ...It's   a   girl! ...What   a   peach! ...What   a   bruiser!
Late opener, huh? You thinks its alive?
I'll say. Listen...
Well, how about that?
Whoa li'l buddy, slow down!
 Ow! Freezy, Fuh-Fuh-Freeezy! All Freezy!
...Jees! ...You ever see a chick move like that before? ...is he damaged? ...is he deranged?
What? Come on. He'll grow out of it.
Come here, li'l Mumble. Let's get you warm and toasty.
Get him to do it again Daddy
Shh. Quiet
 So What happens now, Dad?
We Wait
Is she coming soon?
Any day now.
Tell me again what she's like
 a wiggle when she walks, a giggle when she talks, makes my world go round....
 Hey. Thought I told you not to do that
Sorry. When I get happy my feet get happy too.
Well tell em don't.
But Why Dad?
`Cos it ain't penguin.
Gee I'm hungry
Everyone's hungry son. The mommas are bringing fish soon.
What's fish look like.
You'll see it when she brings one
...Wives-ho! Wives-ho! ...Hubba-hubba! Wives-ho! ...Better late than never.
...Barbra-Ann! ...Peggy Sue!   CONTINUED: MALE PENGUINS ...Hey Paula! ...Roxanne!!
NORMA J.?!
You're not as fat as I thought you'd be.
It was pretty slim pickings. Something's happened I tell you
Even the squid were hard to get We had to swim forever
Everyone split up. A lot of the gals never made it back.
...Delilah?
...Gloria?! Gloria??!
Since my baby left me. I found a new place to dwell. Down the bottom of lonely street at heartbreak hotel
Woah I'm so lonely baby. I'm so lonely baby. I'm so lonely I could...
WISHFUL?
 O Honey. O Baby. You made it!
You hurt?
 Just tired and hungry is all. It was dreadful out there....
But who's this.
I called him Mumble.
Did she get one. Did she bring one back.
Just a little krill that's all
Can I see it?
Later, bud. Give your ma time to regurgitate
Aw. But isn't he just a darling?
 I got one! I got a mum everyone. I got a MUM!!
After that, with food being so scarce everyone was busy busy busy. Mom and dad were working so hard I didn't see much of them. Besides I had school to go to.
Settle class. Settle. We will begin with the most important lesson you will ever learn. Now does anyone know what that is?
Michael?
Don't eat yellow snow?
True but, that's not it. Mumble?
Swimming? Catching Food?
Anyone else?
It's our Heartsong, Miss.
Your Heartsong. Yes. The melody you hear inside, the thing that makes you different from every other penguin. So. Let's all be very still now and listen. And when you hear your song, let it come out. Who's first.
Me! Me! I've got one!  "I can't get no...satisfaction.... I can't get no...girly action..."
Well Michael, if you think that's really you. What have you got for us, Ella?
 Voulez-vous coucher avec moi...ce soir?
 That doesn't make any sense.
Well Mumble...perhaps you can do better
Mine is more sort of a...
Bim bam-a-loolah a bim bam bom
You heard that in there?
You like it?
Dear, that's not even a tune.
It's not?
No, a tune is like...  La la la la la la la la.
Oh, La la la la la
 Listen carefully, Mumble. La la la la la la la la!!
La la la la la la la la!!
 La La La La La La La La!
But that's what I'm doing,
Whats funny?  What's funny?
 It's bizarre. I don't understand it. Did anything happen - you know...- during early development?
No. All fine. Normal incubation, wasn't it honey?
Well Yeah, it was a kinda...a tough winter I guess, and he did hatch a little late, but...  Is there really nothing we can do?
Of course there is. Thats why we have Mrs Astrakhan.
CAN'T SINK? Rubbeesh. Every little pengvin has a sonk. Vhen I have feenished, your singink vill be givink everyone the goosepeempel.
So. Closink the eyes. Liftink chin. Deep breathe here in the downbelow. Now...most important part, find a feelink. Happy feelink, sad feelink, maybe lonely feelink.
So?...So?...
I'm thinking.
Don't think EET!! Feel eet! Through the whole body, from the beak right down to tippy-toes.
And then slowly, very slowly...
Vhat? Vhat is this?
What?
The feet. The jiggy-jog. Don't do eet. Do not move muscle. Rigid like plank, like board. NO MOVINK!!! Now...calm. Remember the feelink.
Feelink...ok.
And be spontanuous.
No! Stop! No jiggy-jog!
I'm being spontanuous.
Not with the feet, with the sonk! You vant to meet beautiful girl? You vant to make the Egg?
Oh yes.
Well singk! "Ba Ba Bleckship, tvinklestar...La la la la la la, la".
 "Twinkle, twinkle, little star. How I..."
Hokay. Enough. Stop. Hokay! Ve go back to the top. Forget the body, look inside the soul. No notes, no sonk, only feelink. Happy feelink. Sad feelink. Enormous feelink, so enormous it fills the whole body. It must escape or you explode! Now, open your leetle beak...
Yes, yes, lift up the head! That's it!
You take a big breath, good and...now! Now!
Disaster! Catastroff! I never fail! Never!
Its tough when you realise you'll never fit in. Plus I was beginning to moult
I couldn't face the class in this mood So I just kept going.
Looking for what? I don't know? A different type of penguin?
And that's exactly what I found.
Not the nicest place in the world but at least you could do what you liked here.
Hey, whacha doin' dere flipperbird?
Me? Oh, nothing. What are you doing?
Oh we just dropped in for a spota lunch. Hey hey hey...
 Lunch?...There's food? Here?
 Leg or wing?
But ...but. I'm a penguin.
Exackly! De flipperbirds - dat's you - eat de fish. De flyinbirds - dat's me - eat de flipperbird an' de fish. Right now D'ain't no fish -- so...you do the math.
And dis time I'm getting the juicy bits.
I don't have juicy bits! Look... all bone and feather! Feel for yourself.
...Hey, break me off a piec'a dat! ...'Smyturn ta pullimapart ya skanky shit- squirter. ...You! Lastime ya pullimapart ya took all the choice stuff!
Wait! WAIT!
Every seen anything like this?
 Nope.
Ok boys, for once we gonna do dis civilised. Now...
Hey! What's that on your leg?
Interesting you should ask?
No! No! Don't startim on that!
Shaddap! The flipperbird aksed me a question. (fixing Mumble with a crazy bloodshot eye.) I got two words for ya: "Alien Abduction".
 ... Now of all times ... Always before we eat
Quiet ya ignorant morons!  ...a lotta folks don't believe this but ...dere's somet'in out dere. Creatures. Not like us. Bigger...Fiercer...smarter, too.
Aks me how I know.
How...?
`Cos I bin capturebyem that's how! I seen `em!
Unbelievable.
Whaddayamean unbelievable?! It's true! I'm sittin' on a rock, mindin' my own business when suddenly... dere onta me. Dese bein's...like big ugly penguins, fat flabby faces with frontways eyes, no feathers, no beaks...an' dese, dese appendages! Dey probe me, dey tiemeup and strapmedown...dey take dis pointy t'ing and stick it inta me! Den...blackout!
You don't say
Gets worse! I woke up and there's dis thing on me!  Go home and every flyinbird starts dissin' me: `Hey Yellaleg'`What's happenin' Whats that on your leg, Yellaleg?' It was humiliatin'!!
At least those aliens didn't eat you.
True. I guess my cries for mercy appealed to their better nature.
So - You think I could appeal to your better nature?
Nice try kid. But No...
Hey! Whatcha think ya doin' down dere flipperbird? Get back up here dis minute!
...Come on, out witcha! ...Ya sneaky-ass flipperbird!
...Great, Yellaleg. ...What did we tell ya ...ya leddim geddaway, dincha with ya screwy alientalk.
Hey, Don't peck me or I'll peck you and when I peck you know you've been pecked...
Compared with that, school almost seemed like fun
Most days I hid at the back, dreaming about the world beyond
Time passed. We all grew up
But right up to graduation I never did find my heartsong
Graduates, today you leave the safety of our community for the first time, forsaking the trusted solid ice for the terrible magic of the deep.
Caruso. He couldn't help himself.
Things are not as they were. For five years now we have known nothing but famine. But you are our hope. Upon your survival depends the very future of the entire Penguin Nation. Dive deep, swim far. May the Great Penguinus go with you. And remember...
Excelsi-yah! Yah yah yah!
Excelsi-yah ! Yah yah yah!
Dad, Ma, can I go with the others
I don't know Wishful. I still don't think he's ready.
Dad? I'll learn to sing later. I'll find my voice out there. In the deep. Truly.
Dad. Pul-eeeze.
Yeooow!!
On you go then, buddy
Thanks Pop. See ya Ma.
 Remember `Stranger Danger'! Never talk to a seal!
Oh my. Stupid. I'm sorry...
 ...You think we'll ever see him again
 Its out of our flippers
...What do you think, here? ...Are you kidding? ...How about over here then?
...That last place looked better.
..I agree. ..Much better.
...then again....
Outta my way flipperbirds! Coming through!!
...What was that?
Mumble?
...Lunatic! ...where did he go? ...See any blood?
Whatcha waiting for? It's fantast...
Go Mumble!
I had an instinct I'd be good at this. Actually we all were. We were the best.
"Suntanned bodies and the waves of sunshine. Those California girls and the beautiful coastline. In the warmed up weather, let's get together and do it again..."
Mumble?
Ella?
Woah!
I've got you! No I don't.
Yes I do.
Hi Ella.
The only bad thing about being with Ella. It was always so darned crowded.
...Ella! ...Where da get to? ...there you are!
"In the warmed up weather, let's get together and do it again."
...FISH!!
 Ella? You get one?
Not this time.
 Here, have it.
Thank you Mumble, but it's yours.
 I want you to have it.
Why don't I have it
Hey! That's a felony! Mumble, let go!

 So fly flipperbird. Fly.
...Is he breathing? ...he's certainly not eating
...Maybe I should just...
Hey. The fish is for Ella  Take it. Really. Its for you
Thank you.
 You're welcome.
 "...Good, Good, Good...Good VibRatiOns..."
...Mumble, ...Knock it off.
"...AaahhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhh..."
 Mumble, the thing is...

....It's better if you just listen.

...Oye! Ritmo Cubana! ...Riba Riba! Shake those hips! ...Yo penguino, bust a move!
...Then mebbe something like... ...No. I got it. Watch me!
Or how about ...
 ...Eat my ice, lardface. ...Kiss my frozen toosh, rubber butt
I know where you live.
...Yeah, it's called The Land, tubby. ...Flop back anytime!
...Hey, ain't you coming, tallboy? ...Or you got something better to do?
Wow, there are so many of you!
...Hey, this is nothin'. ...Used to be twice as many of us. ...Yeah, back when you could still catch a fish.
The shortage has affected you too?!
...Who you calling shortish? ...All I know is a lot of us ain't comin' back. ....And Some folks so hungry they eating rocks
 ...Eating rocks!!? ...That is major funny.
Why funny? That's terrible
...Just kidding the rocks are for nest- building ...That's how its works here. The one with the most rocks gets the chicas. ..Chica boom chica boom chica boom boom BOOM!
So why aren't you guys collecting them
..Cos we got personality!. ...Without us the chicas got no boom boom. ...Without us the fiesta will be a siesta.. ...Watch and learn tallboy.
...Hola Conchita!
...See something you like?
Hey. Cool. Where'd you learn that?
...The big guy. ...He from out of town. ...He with us.
Do it again.
...Sorry Show's over.  ...Treat em mean and keep em keen   CONTINUED: THE ADELIES ...hold back `til the season, when they begging for it.
 Yeah guys, in your dreams
...You see. Some penguins got it, some don't And the Amigos,  WE GOT IT!
....you think I could get some of it?
Hombre, you got so much already, you dangerous.
Yow!
You really think so?
...You got the biggest personality of any of us. ...Except for me, maybe. ...Put that ego away, Ramon, you gonna hurt someone.
So for a while I forgot about finding a song altogether.
...We were a team
...there was so much to do, so much to see
...Arriba! ..Addidas amigos!
...Where's the tall-boy ...I thought he was with you.
....stuff down there beyond my wildest imagining.
... You sure he went in there? ...Mumble! ...Done go near it, looks like it can bite
Ramos!
Oh! There you are
Guys!    I want to speak to you.
...Forget it ...We're not going back there ...Never
But its dead. It can't hurt you
...Maybe its got a brother still alive.
But that's what we have to find out. Don't you see. Things like that could be eating the fish.
Okay. Okay. Here's the plan: we go and ask the revered one.
The who?
...Reverend Loveday. ...The One who Knows ...First we gonna need stones though
Why stones? Wait for me
First, the devotion...
A moment...  ... and your question?
The Mystic Beings are speaking to me. Yes! She is alive and happy and you are in her thoughts...
One pebble, one question. Next!
I sense...you are the one with the question.
...How does he do it? ...He just one look and he know.
A little nervous? That's normal. Take your time.
I was wondering. Have You ever been abducted by Aliens?
No time wasters. Next!
...Seor! That's not his question. He's new here.  ...The yellow thing ...Ask him what's taking the fish?
 ...you see I met a Skua once, with something like that on his legs....
...Skua? Leg? What's he talking about?
... and he said he was abducted by Aliens.
 Listen friend, this is my Sacred Talisman, bestowed upon me by the Mystic Beings...
Looks like they bestowed it very tight.
...during my Epic Journey of Enlightenment to the Forbidden Shore!
So these Mystic Beings, did you see them?
I hear them. They talk to me all the time I am their instrument. They chose me to......
Did they have frontways eyes? No feathers? Fat flabby faces? Did they probe you and stick a pointy thing into you?
Enough! How many questions is that? You don't have enough pebbles.
But I haven't had any answers yet!
SILENCIO!! The Mystic Beings are speaking. They say show some respect stranger. Especially to the One who Knows.
The reason there are not enough fish is simple: There is not enough love in the world. Love is the answer!
 Okay, everybody, turn around to the penguin next to you and give them a great big hug. Comeon, everybody...hug! This is a safe place.
Now. The Mating Season starts today so here's what everybody should do: go forth and multiply! If you'll excuse I myself must retire for a moment to the couch of indulgence... okay ladies, who's gonna be first
..Me Loveday. ..Me! ..No Me !
One at a time! And don't touch the Talisman!
....I liked him better when he was just plain Pedro. ...Did he say it starts today ...why didn't someone tell us. ...We gotta get to work guys!!
...Hola Baby! Get your chica boom-boom here. ... Turn round, look at us!.
...How many rocks you got.
...Forget `em honey. They only one between the six of them...and they just spent it.
 Wait. Look.
...You like it ...Arriba! ...What do you need stones for
Try sitting on the ice for a month. It might come to you Salsa Boy. Come on, Consuela.
...Their loss, guys. ...Ramon, where you going?
Gotta be some rocks left here somewhere!  Hey big guy, got any love stones over where you come from?
We don't collect them. All we have to do is , well... We sing
...Easy as that? ...So why aren't you over there?
La la la la la la la laaaaaaaaaaaaa!!
 ...What's he doing? ...Its a distress call ...Its world music ...Get out of here!
See. That's how I ended up with you guys. And emperor who can't sing isn't an emperor at all.
Man. You're an emperor all right, You're a king among emperors. The singing we can fix.
You can?!
No problem. Which way's this colony of yours?
...We'll all come. ...Yeah I like em tall. ...You jus' gotta do exac'ly as I say.
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?
Tall and tanned and young and lovely The Girl from Ipanema goes walking And when she passes each guy she passes goes `Aaaah'
Oh, and I want her so badly How can I tell her I love her? Yes I would give my heart gladly 
Mumble?
Tall and tanned and young and lovely..
 Hi Ella, what do you think?
Hola bonita!
Mumble, that's just cheap
Wait up! You and me baby, we can make sweet music. I may be short but I'm a love god...Ooww!
Ella. Wait!
I'm sorry.
 When you left without saying goodbye I thought something had happened, then I thought he just doesn't care.
Don't care? I never stopped thinking about you.
And then when I saw you singing, for a second I thought...
I can't sing.
I know. I know. Its impossible.
But I'll show you something better
Sing something to this!
 What's the point. It's embarrassing
Just try it. This once.
Okay, that'll work. Just keep it going.
"...turn around you fool You know I love you more and more..."
"Tell me why is it so Don't wanna let you go I never can say goodbye, no...no no no..."
This is it Ella! This is the song inside me!
 STOP...THIS...DEPRAVITY!!!
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS ABOMINATION?!!
I'm just showing them Happy Feet
Happy WHAT?! This is an OUTRAGE!
It is exactly this kind of disrespectful, heretic behaviour that has brought the Scarcity upon us! Don't you see...we are being brought to account by the Forefathers!
... The kid was never quite the full Penguin. ... It all began the year he hatched. ... That's right! He's the one who brought the blight!
 Wait. Wait. You think it's my fault that there are no fish?!! Doing Happy Feet can't cause a food shortage.
...then what did?!
My own opinion? I think living beyond the ice there are creatures we've never met before Aliens. Mystic Beings. Big, flabby......
 ...He has abandoned the faith. ...He has driven the fish away.
 ...Come on hombre, loosen up, ...the tall guy was just trying to....
Don't touch me! Heathen!!
BACK OFF, YA SCREWY-ASS FLIPPERBIRD!
 ...Skua talk!! He's talking Skua talk!   CONTINUED: THE ELDERS ...He's the spawn of evil!! ...The devil penguin!!!
This is craziness
No, Son they're right.
You too pa?!
Truth is, I'm the cause of it. I dropped the egg. I made you how you are. If only you'd come back to us, relinquish the dark side
No. Dad. No. What have they done to you. You're talking like Caruso.
Just do it. Pray to the Forefathers for forgiveness.
No. You're nuts. All of you. I'm outa here.
Wait! Mumble!
Its no use Ella. I can't live with that.
Can you live without it?
I believe in you, Mumble. But without the huddle we can't make an egg. Without the egg, what are we here for?
...True ...That's a big question
Guys. Can Me and Ella be alone for a bit
OK. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to talk an alien. I'm going to find what's causing the shortage
But what about?...
Its the only way. You're right. Unless we have food theres no future for any of us - you, me the adelies, anyone
But...
Give me a year, just until the next great gathering. If I don't make it back ....at least I tried
But...
Now go back. I love you. Go.
"Together we stand"
"Divided we freeze."
Recite the Wisdoms!
"In the Wisdoms we trust."
"When all others leave..."
"We Remain."
Louder. More fervent bretheren. "When the Sun vanishes..."
"We Remain."
Tell me again where we're going.
To find the mystic beings.
How do we know where they live.
We'll ask Loveday. He's been there.
...Not so close. We got babies on board
...Wow. Does nesting make em touchy
...LOVEDAY, you okay?? ...what happened ...Too much boom-boom for one penguin?
Just one question! And I want a straight answer! Where do I find the Mystic Beings?
Why don't he speak?
Talisman...sounds like Talisman!!
...He's possessed! ...It's a seizure!
No. He's choking! The Talisman's gotten way too tight.
...Why din' you say so? ...Hold on we gonna take it off. ...You pull that side, I pull this side.
Stop. You're hurting him.
Any better?
...It not gonna come off. ...Of course it's not! It's sacred!
LOVEDAY, where did you get it?
...It was bestowed on him. ...By the Mystic Beings!
They didn't bestow it on you?
...Poor Guy. ...He don't know what he's saying.
If it wasn't bestowed, what happened?
...Oh, this one's easy. ...He swam.... ...On his Hectic Journey of Delightenment... ...To the Forbidding Shore.
And then....?
...Well to me that's gotta be bestowing.
You looked up and...... It just got caught around your neck?
...No way. No. He's the revered one ...He speaking symbolically.
 Loveday, did you ever meet a Mystic Being? Really?
But this thing was made by someone. And if we find them, they could take it off.
So where do we Go, Loveday
Oh my! Now he thinks he's an Elephant Seal
He wants to go to the top of the mountain.
The forbidden place is over the mountains...
...In the land of the Elephant Seals!!?
...Beyond the land of the Elephant Seals!!?
So who's coming
Oi
...Stop. Enough. We must've gone past it ...Past? Don't kid me. We're not even close.
Hear that?!
...Refresh my memory do elephant seals eat penguin? ...No, no...jus' krill and fish. ...Sure of your facts are you?
Well I guess we're about to find out
Excuse me, we need directions...to the Forbidden Shore.
We're looking for the Mystic Beings
Aliens, the ones who made this.
Could they be taking our fish?
But If your grandpappys saw them and they survived, maybe they're not so fierce.
You calling me a liar son?
He's calling your grandpappy a liar. And you know what, Maybe he's right.
Why you. Flop over here and say that!
Come on Loveday, lets go
 ...Go where? ...didn't you hear what he said ...Its Forbidden
They don't know. They've never been there
Stop! I'm hearing voices. The mystical guys. They say: "Your life is perfectly good as it is...forget this stupid mission".
Ramon. That was embarrassing, man.
So we walked ... and walked .. and kept walking. Over the hills and into Blizzard country
...Oh man! This is no place for a penguin! ...We should be migrating out to sea by now!
We need to huddle!
Huddle??!
Form a moving circle! Share the cold, share the warmth!
...Oh yeah, nice. ...That's definitely better. ...Good call big guy.
I said a circle!
...No, no. This can't be right! ...It was better the other way.
...Hey! ...What happened to the Huddle?!
 Just keep moving! Toboggan, if you have to!!
...Oh no, now I got chest pain ...tell you, this is a good way to get snow blind 
You think this is it? The Forbidden Shore?
....The way I feel": the "frostbitten" shore ....So what are those black things?.
Hello?! Is there anyone out there?
Hello!!
...No need to shout. ...Yeah, somebody might hear you. ...I think we seen all there is to see round here.
What is it?
They must be here somewhere. They wouldn't leave all this stuff lying around.
Maybe they invisible.
What is that?
A whale?
As long as it's a good whale, not the other kind.
What other kind?!!
The ones with teeth!!
...Jump! ...Swim for it!
No!! Stay on the ice pad where its safe
...You call this safe amigo? ...Maybe we should split up. ...You split up I'm staying right here.
Woooaaaahhh!!
 LOVEDAY! LOVEDAY!!
Aliens?!
Stop! Please!....
...It's very important!
WE...HAVE...TO...TALK!
...AMIGO-O-O-O! ...LET IT GO-O-O-O-O!!
...You found them, you found Aliens! ...Now we go back tell everybody who's taking the fish.
...Don't feel bad Tall Guy. ...They were just too fast. Too big. ...Too everything.
They've stopped!
Mumble. I owe you my life amigo. And I say this because I admire and deeply respect you. If you are thinking what I think you are thinking. You are out of your crazy head
Say Hi to Ella for me
You say Hi. Come back and say Hi to her yourself
Oh. One other thing. You guys
What?
Excelsi yah!!!
...can you believe that ...brought us all this way and killed himself ...no he didn't! look!
...A dive like that, and still he lives! ... Yeah like when he did his Happy Feet, his feet had wings. ...A normal penguin could never have done it.
You don't think we should go with him
...Don't sweat it Revered One. Many are called, few are chosen.   CONTINUED: ADELIES ..Hey, how tall you think the Tall Guy was? ...Who could say? Four times my height at least...
About this Revered One stuff, you guys
Yeah
Maybe just call me Pedro
 HEY! YOU CAN'T DO THAT! WHAT ABOUT US?! THE SCARCITY! THE SCARCITY!!
HEY YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET AWAY WITH THIS?!! NOT IF I CAN HELP IT YOU SHIT- SQUIRTER ALIEN CREEPS.
Too loud.
Too loud!
He's looking for a mate, mate. And these days, I tell you they're few and far between
Talking of which, I never seen a penguin this far out. Watch you don't hit The Convergence mate.
The Convergence?
Where the cold water meets the warm, mate. Once you cross it, there's no getting' back. What you tryinmg to prove anyway?
I'm trying to talk to the Aliens!
The who?
On the black iceberg. The ones taking all the fish!
Them. Fish is just the start of it Mate. Them aliens is the ones who took out the whales.
They kill whales! That's impossible
Straight up mate. Biggest creatures ever lived. Decimated, mate.
So if I wanted to talk to them, where would I go
Anywhere and everywhere. Over the sea, under the sea, Jees, I've even seen them fly. The great southland's swarming with em
Where's that. Do you think the Whale would take me there?
No way mate, he won't go anywhere near `em. And neither should you.
Don't say I didn't warn you
When I finally saw one, the Alien was even more hideous than I'd imagined
... frontways eyes, no feathers. Big teeth with blood around them. Strange fleshy beak. A meat eater
 The - fish - are - ours. Understand?
We can't live without them!
Speak Adelie? Skua-talk?
Oh no! Not the pointy thing!
I woke in darkness. Unable to move. Was I dead? And if I was dead, where was that light coming from
Wow. They brought me home
Excuse me, where are we.
Heaven. Where d'you think?
Oh. So we're dead. Right
Dunno. Don't care. We got food. We got water. You hear a seal now and then, but you never meet one. Perfect.
Fish!
Where?
Fish time. Fish time!
Every day after that, it rained fish in the afternoon.
Fish on land and fish underwater.
Sometime you got a live one but there was nowhere really to chase it
Aliens everywhere, watching you eat, watching you sleep
 What have you done to my wing! This is not my home! I want to get out of here!
After a while, you learn to stop fighting it. Stop protesting, take the knocks.
...just take what comes and live inside your mind
Sometimes I thought about dad and mum. Sometimes the Amigos, and others I'd met along the way. But mostly I thought about Ella, wondering who she ended up with. Whether she had enough food to eat. whether she still remembered our song.
Look Mommy! It's dancing!
What? What did I do?
You like that? Well how about this.
Oh-Oh, another one gone troppo
You think its infectious
I sure hope not
Yes. Yes. At last something was happening. I was finally getting through to them!
...What's that? ...Where? ...Coming from the Inland!
...Is it a Penguin? ...Is it one of ours?
Hi, where is everybody!?
Who wants to know?
I used to live here. When's the Great Gathering?
This is it. I guess
This is all that's left?
... So Who's this? ...Kinda small for an emperor. ... Where did you say you were from?
Mumble?! Its Mumble!!
Ella! Is it you. You haven't changed a bit.
Are these all yours?
They're my singing students.
So. You never....
Of course not. I was waiting for you.
But that's fantastic. I've got so much to tell you - to tell everyone.  I found out who's been causing the Scarcity!
Huh?
I know who's been taking our fish! I made contact with Aliens! They're coming here. Right behind me. Listen.
...Who's doing all the shouting ...Its Mumble. He's worse than before.
No, honestly Aliens will be here soon! You have to believe me. We came in a big hollow bird and they landed on the ice and....
You again! And still full of the same old nonsense.
But its true!!
Move along everyone. Pay no attention. There's no such thing as aliens
So who fixed him up with this.
...Does it hurt? ....Its not made of feathers thats for sure ...what's it gonna do
It's so they can find me.  That's them now. Listen.
You led them here. Are you crazy!!
You said they didn't exist.
They'll slaughter us. Head for the sea!
No. Do this. Do Happy feet.
Its what they understand. They can't talk, they can't sing. They speak with their feet. Do it.
Now look what you've done!
...its the end of the world. ....Its all Mumbles fault. I told you
Just do what the kid says.
Recite the wisdoms! "Together we stand". "Divided We Freeze".
Come on, everyone! Happy Feet! It's our only chance!
"When all others leave, we Remain
FEET!!
CHANT!!
FEET! FEET!! HAPPY FEET!!
That's it! Excellent! Riba Riba, penguinos! Shake those hips. Come on, bust a move!!
Adhere to the wisdoms!! The Ancients will protect us
....Aliens. ... I never doubted it for a moment
More feelink. BE SPONTANUOUS!!
 You know who that is? That's my boy!
 Know him? He ees my star pupol! I TEACH HIM EVERYTHINGK!
From that day on, No one quite knows how it happened, but the black icebergs began to disappear and the fish became abundant once more.
...So what do you reckon?
Yes, quite extraordinary. (stares at the screen) some kind of neurological disorder? a nutritional deficiency perhaps. We'd certainly back the long-term study.
And the international treaty?
Yes. This is exactly the leverage we need for an embargo. No fishing whatsoever...legal, illegal, sanctioned, whatever.
So we all step up policing of the pirate factory ships. And we pressure that country to stop their so-called `experimental' fishing.
Yes, if our government asks your government to approach their government to call off their fleet...
Better if their government hear it from our government via your government...
What the heck. The amount of publicity this is generating, they'd have world war three if they didn't stop.
Ella's gave up teaching to look after our chick. We take turns looking after her and going to get the fish.
I worry about her, sure. Theres so much big stuff out there it can be kind of frightening.
But the way I see it. Theres so much out there we don't understand...,
Or am I not making sense here?
Is there a problem? I thought this one was barren.
More or less. But one of the stars we're harvesting supports these things here.
So...?
Well. Exactly. But what we didn't know about before was these things here
Just thought you'd want to see them before...you know.
Hmm.   Charming
So.    We go ahead. Or...?
No. Better leave them be. See what sector twelves got to offer instead.
