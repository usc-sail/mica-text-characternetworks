Oh Pete! Oh my god! This is crazy!
Oh my god. So incredible. Want to know a secret? I took a Viagra.
What?
I took a Viagra. Those things totally work. This is awesome. Why don't I use this every day?
What? What did you do? Wait. Stop.
What's the matter?
You just took a Viagra to have sex with me?
I thought it would make it better. It was better. It takes some of the pressure off.
Because you can't get hard without a Viagra? Is it because you don't think I'm sexy?
I thought you'd think it was fun for me to supersize it for once.
That is the worst birthday present you could ever give someone.
I was just trying to go turbo for your birthday. 
My hard-ons are still in analog. This shit's digital.
I don't want a turbo penis. I like your medium soft one.
Look, I can get it up. Just not that far up.
Where did you get this?
I got it from Barry.
What? You got it from Barry?
Why do you care? This is my dick we're talking about, not yours.
We are young people. We don't need medication to have sex.
I only took it because it's your birthday. I thought you'd like it. Happy fucking fortieth birthday.
I am not forty! And I don't want to have a husband who has to take Viagra to get a hard-on.
I don't have to take it every time, but once in a while...
Fuck forty! Forty can suck my dick.
Your breath smells weird.
Wake up, wake up. Time to get up.
We're ready!
Make a wish!
Can I watch Lost?
You can't handle Lost. It's too violent, and you won't understand.
If I don't understand it, why can't I handle it?
Because you're eight.
I can handle it. I've seen a shark eat a guy on Shark Week.
Shark Week is fake.
No, it's not.
All of it is reenactments.
I know but they--
That's scary! You shouldn't be allowed to watch that.
--they show the reenactments but they actually happened.
It's going to give you nightmares.
I can handle a nightmare. You're a nightmare every day for me.
Hey. Don't eat that cupcake.
What?
The one you just put into the sink. I saw you were hiding that.
This cupcake? You think I'm going to eat this cupcake?
Yeah.
I so don't want this cupcake. Look.
You're still going to eat it.
I'm going to eat this cupcake?
Just put it in the trash.
What would you like to do today? Your choice.
Anything?
Yeah, anything.
Just hang out with you guys.
Don't you want to get a massage? Or do something fun? Forty's huge.
I'm turning thirty-eight.
Okay. Thirty-eight. We'll move on. Isn't it weird that our birthday is the same week and that we're going to have a party, and it's just for me?
No. I don't think it's weird at all. Because you're turning forty and I'm turning thirty-eight.
Come on. Do you really want to be one of those ladies who's just so insecure about their age and they lie and then they've got to remember.
You don't get it. You don't understand how it works. I don't want to shop at old lady stores. I don't want to go to J. Jill and Chicos and Ann Taylor Loft. I'm not ready yet. I need two more years.
That is so insane, it kind of makes sense.
What did you get me for my birthday?
I thought you said that we shouldn't get each other gifts this year?
What do you mean? You're supposed to get me a surprise gift. This is a big birthday. I'm turning forty!
Mom!!
Mom! Why can't I get new clothes?! Nothing fits me!! God damn it!!
I am going to work out. I'll be back in about an hour.
Hey, did your father call to wish you a happy birthday?
No. That's no surprise.
Come on.
Coming.
You've got to keep up with us, sweetheart. That's why your body looks like your body and her body looks like her body. Before, after. Before, after.
You guys just go on without me. I'm just gonna... fuck.
Hey, thanks for letting me join this team.
It's not really a team, it's just a bunch of guys who get together and ride.
I know, I know.
Bike lane, asshole! It's always the guy in the fucking Infiniti.
So why on earth is Pete taking Viagra? What's going on?
I don't know. I think maybe he just isn't attracted to me anymore.
That is ridiculous. If you were my girlfriend, I would not need a Viagra. I would need an anti-Viagra pill. To try not to get a boner.
But everyone gives you a boner.
Don't sell yourself short like that. You give me a boner.  Barb doesn't give me a boner.
Maybe things are just getting stale. That's why maybe I work out really hard. Maybe he'll be able to get a boner again.
Why do you need to have sex, Deb? Sex is the number one thing people fight about. 
You stop having sex, there will be no more fights. I am living proof. I have no sex, and I am the happiest I've ever been.
I knew it. I knew you were not having sex. I can see it on your face. It's all puckered and pained.
I'm enjoying our non-sex period, that's all I'm saying.
Don't you miss it?
Well, I wouldn't know, because I don't have any feeling down there anymore. I have nerve damage from my C-section so everything is just kinda-
She's numb down there.
I could sit down hard on a fire hydrant, and I wouldn't even know that I was sitting. I could get stung by a hornet down there, and I would not feel it. You could put anything in there, and I would not know what the object was. I used to pee in a nice stream, and now it just kind of goes like a shower head.
That is the saddest thing I've ever heard.
I think you need a family. Don't you want a family?
No, I think I want to Clooney it.
Clooney it?
Yup.
He doesn't seem happy.
Yeah, he is.
No. He's lonely.
No, he's not.
See, I think he has sad eyes.
Aw, you sweet little thing. He's doing sad, lonely eyes. To get the next lady. I can do it too, watch.
I bet George Clooney is really lonely. Just him and his pig.
You'd fuck him.
I wouldn't.
So would you.
I would. I wouldn't feel it but-
You'd fuck him with your numb vagina. Yes, you would. Ocean's thirteen inches, that's what you'd find out.
Do you think?
I mean that was idiotic. You have to understand. That's like the one thing you don't do is tell her you used Viagra. I think that's even on the warning label.
We're in one of those phases where everything the other person says just annoys the shit out of each other. All the time. It's a blast.
Don't worry about it. You just gotta ride that out.
This sounds terrible but do you ever wonder what it would be like if, say, you were separated by something bigger, like death. Like her death?
I have given it a fair amount of thought.
Not in a painful way. Just quietly slid into death. Like a gas leak.
Absolutely. It has got to be peaceful. I mean this is the mother of your children.
I'd want it to be a peaceful -- just like, drift, into a coma, from which she never awakens.
Then you move on. Then you're a widower.
That's just it. People love widowers.
They love widowers. It's like the polar opposite of divorced guys.
It's the best.
It's like, oh, that poor widower. You know. If I could only--
Somehow...
...make him happy.
Somehow ease his pain.
...cocksuck away his sadness.
Did you know that the Pixies did this song about a Salvador Dali short film called "Un Chien Andalou"?
This music doesn't make people happy.
This song kicks off Doolittle, one of the best albums of the last thirty years. An important record.
Look how angry you get while listening to this.  It's my birthday. You don't control the radio on my birthday. I control the radio on my birthday.
Sadie's watching Lost.
Sadie, how many times have you watched Lost this week?
I've only watched eleven. I have eight more and then I'm done.
How many are there?
A hundred and fourteen?
Are you kidding me? You can't watch over a hundred episodes of a show in five weeks. It'll melt your brain.
It's not melting my brain, it's blowing my mind.
That's really bad, Sadie. You're not allowed to do that.
My relationship with Lost is not your business. It's extremely personal.
Stop it!
Be nice to your sister. You guys are going to cherish each other one day.
Stop it! Stop!
It's your birthday, you don't need to go to the store.
I know, just five minutes. I think Desi and Jodi are fighting.
All right, five minutes. But then I'm pulling you out.
Hi. How's Jodi treating you?
Jodi? Oh, Jodi's my new BFF. She's like a little kitty cat. Sometimes she comes and rubs up against my leg.
You're a ball of shit.
She loves me.
Huh.
Can you do inventory so that we can do the sidewalk sale? And you really need to pay attention to the numbers because we have twelve thousand dollars unaccounted for.
I think it's probably Desi. She's been having a really hard time using these simple computers. 
It's because she's stupid. I think she might be stealing.
She's not stealing. She's our best employee. She made nine grand last month.
Well, how much did I make?
You brought in twenty-two hundred.
That's not bad.
Well, that's not that good. I mean, I'm not comparing you, but you're not as good.
 All right. See you.
I don't think she's wearing underwear.
What?
It's all dark up there.
What? Why are you looking?
I didn't mean to look, I just said, `Hey- woah!' There it was.
Maybe she's wearing dark underwear.
Yeah. Maybe she has underwear that has a picture of a vagina painted on it.
Stop looking.
Maybe some deep oranges and browns and maybe dark greens? That would really play up your features.
I'll just take out my AmEx and you pick what stuff you think is good.
Woo! Where's daddy?
I think he went to poop.
Pete!
What are you doing?
Going to the bathroom.
We're all downstairs waiting for you. You've been up here for a really long time now.
Oh, I'm almost done. I'll be down in a second.
Charlotte just did her first flip on the trampoline, and she landed on her feet. She was really proud of herself.
Oh, that's great.
And you missed it.
She'll do it again.
It's just that this is the fourth time you've gone to the bathroom today.
Give me a break.
Why is your instinct to escape?
It's not my instinct to escape from you. It is my instinct to come into the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom.
How come I don't smell anything?
It's because I shoved an Altoid up my ass before I came in here.
Let me see then.
What?
Let me see!
No, I'm not going to let you see.
You're not going to let me see because you're not taking a poop.
I've been flushing as I go.
You're flushing as you go? Who takes a half hour to go to the bathroom?
 John Goodman.
Don't press Enter! I'm not sure I want to make that move!
You know, when I started this label, my dream was to work with musicians and bands whose music I just admired so much. The person that I thought, "My god, wouldn't it be incredible to work with" was Graham Parker. Tonight we have him. Solo. Because we couldn't afford to fly in The Rumour.
It's just not my kind of music.
Really. What is your kind of music?
I like Lady Gaga.
Oh, god, of course you do.
What?
Shallow dance music.
It's not! It's fun, and it's about release and sex and power.
You know, you don't have to like it. It's really not for you, that's fine.
This is a job. This is not a hobby. Can't you love him just as a hobby? And sign a fifteen-year-old hot girl so we can eat?
Graham Parker and The Rumour had two albums in the Rolling Stone Top 500 Best Albums of All Time. Two of `em. If I can just sell ten thousand records to his hardcore fan base, we're golden.
 The last of Graham Parker's fans just died.
Sadie. Sadie, what are you listening to? 
Okay, this is music that makes people happy. And this is what people buy. Right, girls?
Why did you take it off?
Now, something that really rocks.
This is called good music. From somebody's heart.
This is bumming me out. This isn't fun.
Just listen to these words, okay?
I don't understand the words.
This is lyrics, this is poetry. This is what is going to survive in a hundred years.
It just doesn't make people happy.
It makes me happy. I can dance to it.
You're the only one in the room who's happy.
Sometimes, I wish just one of you had a dick.
Well, we don't want one.
 Is there something that you can do to be helping me right now?
Yeah, I'm ready to help. Just tell me what to do.
Can you go get a lunch box or something?
For me or for them?
Charlotte! I've got a test!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Charlotte, I'm going to kill you!
Shhh!
Hi, any day now, huh?
Katie's dying for a play date. Let's hook these two up.
That would be great, I'll call you.
No.
"No" what?
No.
What? She's sweet.
She's evil.
Hi. Listen, Charlotte really needs to get here on time because she needs the extra time to just settle in.
Oh. We are on time.
Being on time means being early.
Oh. Okay.
Well, it's nice to see you in class. We'd like to see more of you.
I come to--
Hi Debbie!
Hi, Grandma Molly.
How are you? I'm so happy about the science fair. It's going very well I heard. I love you. You look so beautiful. Happy birthday! I just learned it's your fortieth. Are you forty?
Yeah.
I remember when I was forty, and then I blinked and there I was, going to be ninety. My god, where did it go? One day you're going to blink, and you're going to be ninety, and I won't be around to see it. And that makes me very sad. I'm telling you, I'm warning you. Don't blink. Don't blink.
And then you missed the mortgage payment, and that's the second mortgage. You've got to tighten your belt. You've got to go home, sit down, look at your expenses, come clean with Debbie.
Oh, god. I can't tell Debbie.
You have to tell her, Pete.
She knows it's bad, but she has no idea just how bad.
If you sell the house, it'll really buy you some time.
No. Debbie's not really into selling the house.
As your business manager and your friend, I can't recommend that.  Hey, how funny would it be if I bought your house?
Okay. Bye.
Hang in there.
What are you doing?
I'm contextualizing him as one of the great figures in rock history.
You can't show him in his prime in `77 and then jump straight to him as he is now. It's terrifying. You have to reverse it. You've got to show him as he is now very briefly, and then show him in 1977. You have to "Benjamin Button" it.
I don't know what you're talking about, okay? All rock stars are older now. Steven Tyler, David Bowie, Mick Jagger--
Paul McCartney.
Okay, stop it. Everybody you're mentioning looks like an old woman now. You're just mentioning a bunch of Jessica Tandys. Keith Richards gets away with it. But that's because Keith Richards looked seventy when he was forty, and now that he's seventy, he looks sixty- nine. He's regenerating.
I like it. And I think Graham Parker is sexy.
Would you fuck him?
Yes.
You'd fuck him, and you won't fuck me?
I mean, I kind of fucked you once, if you could have finished.
Oh, I finished.
You know what, enough of who fucked who and who finished what.
I finished.
Look. It's a retro label. That's our niche. That's our market. It costs money to break new bands, I can't do that.
Oh, okay. And also you're the guy who turned down Arcade Fire.
Everyone turned down Arcade Fire.
It's crazy, there are so many of them!
We don't have the money to market a new band. We just need to make Graham seem relevant. Who is he talking to?
Um, the Jewish Journal.
The Jewish Journal?
Apparently old Jews are the only ones who still buy hard copies of records. Because they don't like to download music. Because they don't know what downloading means.
Why is this album different from any other album?
It isn't.
What is he wearing?
It's a hat with the Oreo logo on it.
Why?
I don't think he's being ironic, I think he just really likes Oreos.
Look. The Paul Westerberg record did okay. Frank Black did all right. The Haircut 100, not so much. We have to break this record. Otherwise, we're not here next year.
He's coming. Oreo man is coming.
Hey guys, how are you?
Aren't cookies the best?
Yeah. Jewish Journal guy loves the record.
Great!
Got a bit of a problem. Touch of gout.
Gout?
Yeah, my whole family, they all had gout.
Jesus.
That's very unfortunate.
My auntie Queenie, she had a foot like the size of a small pig. I've got a photo of it.
I'd love to see that photo of that gout foot.
A couple of bunions as well.
Fuck.
I've got to go to the podiatrist, and I hope he can shoot me up with something.
Yeah, well, let's get you to the podiatrist.
Bye, Graham.
See you later, Graham. Good luck with your gout!
Rock and Roll, baby.
The happiest period in people's lives is from age forty to sixty. So this is it. We're in it, right now.
Says who?
Says a lot of people, most people.
Huh.
We have everything we need right now to be completely happy. We're going to blink and be ninety.
What?
So, let's just choose to be happy.
Yeah.
Your eyes are kind of glazing over.
No, I'm just processing it all.
Some of these I wrote for you. So, we have to exercise every day. Spend more time alone together. We have to go to the therapist every week.
That's a little pricey.
No stressing over tiny things.
Yeah, that's good. You should do that.
We have to get more involved in school. Have more patience with the kids. And we need to work on our anger.
Yeah, I think it would be good if you could take care of your anger.
No, I said both of us.
That's what I said. Our anger.
Okay. No more smoking.
Yeah, you've got to cut that out.
I don't want to make this about a fight, I want to just be positive.
Sorry.
Okay, and then no more holding on to resentments. We have to just let that go.
So, you're saying that if we're arguing and I apologize, you'll let it go and not throw it back in my face later?
Well, I don't do that, but I will continue not to do that. What did you write?
All of that. That's plenty. That's a lot.
And you're going to eat better?
Oh, yeah. I've been doing a decent job, but I don't think there's anything wrong with having some fries every now and again.
And then I'll smoke that day.
That's not the same thing.
It is the same thing.
I like fries.
And the other thing is your dad stuff.
The not letting him guilt trip you all the time, because that puts a lot of pressure on you, and the whole family feels it. He's a grown man, and he's not our responsibility. And you're not giving him money anymore, right?
No, I haven't been giving him money for years, I told you.
Can you please put that down?
A lot of people are RSVP-ing to your birthday party.
You sure you don't want to just do a joint birthday party?
No.
We always used to.
No.
Did Jodi tell you she thinks Desi's stealing?
Are you serious?
Yes.
How much?
Twelve thousand dollars.
Oh, god. And Desi's taking it?
Well, I don't know. That's what Jodi said.
We really need the store to work.
It is. Don't put that kind of pressure on me.
That's not what I mean.
Are you nervous about money? Are we okay?
Yeah. Maybe we just suck it up because she's clearly earning so much more than any other employee we have.
Oh, yeah. For sure. We can't fire her. We're barely breaking even with her.
That's why we have to keep her.
Look at this, she's making out with somebody.
Is she screwing him??
That might be like a dry hump.
Look at the position of her skirt.
That's too grainy to know for sure. Oh my god, this is the middle of the day. Customers could be in there.
At least she's getting some.
What did you say? "At least she's getting some"?
Yes.
What are you talking about? We had sex the other night. You have to give me a little credit for that.
It's not about credit. We need to have more passion. Like this.
That's not passion.
It looks like passion to me.
What--
What is she doing?
Oh my god. Don't do that!
What am I doing?
Don't fart in the bed!
I'm not, it's the springs.
This is why we never have sex. That's disgusting. You're gross.
I don't know what you're talking about.
 Sadie. Sadie, Sadie! Sadie, Sadie!
Charlotte. I'm doing my homework.
Okay, watch this. There's a haunted cow back here, and I'm pretty sure it does not have milk!
Did you see that? They took me away!
You're no fun. You never want to play.
Charlotte. How many times do I have to tell you--
 Sadie! Sadie, Sadie! Is boring!
You're so mean since your body got weird.
Close the door.
Did I tell you that my son is going to Stanford?
No, that's great.
Great for us and great for him. Cough again. Everything looks good.
Your face is close to my face.
Descending colon. I'm about four feet in right now.
 That's what he said.
Do you grind your teeth?
I grind all night.
I think we need to turn the gas down.
Turn it up!
No, we're going to turn it down.
Turn it up!
Do you have to breathe right on my neck?
Sorry.
What are you all doing for Christmas?
I don't know.
Do you have a tree and everything?
Yes.
Isn't that fun. Get in the spirit--
Hi, sorry I just have one quick question. On your form you said you were born in 1974, but your paper said 1972. I just need to know which it is.
Oh. It's 1974.
Because on your last form you said that you were born in 1975.
Didn't you tell me you were born in 1976?
No. That's funny.
So you want to go with 1974?
I'm not going to "go" with 1974, it is 1974.
Okay. Just remember to write 1974 every time.
It's okay. It's 1976.
I lie about my age, okay?
Okay.
Okay? Okay? Okay?!
You're tightening up.
Oh my gosh.
I know how old you are. By counting the rings! Little gyno joke.
What are you doing?
Getting ready to go for my ride.
You want a blow job?
Yeah. Why?
I really want a cigarette right now.
Well, happy to help.
Charlotte, where is my backpack?
Hello?
Mom's busy!
Why are you locking the door? Mom!
What's going on in there?
Mom, I can't be late for school, I have a test!
Mommy can't talk right now!
This isn't funny, Mom. I need to go.
Mom, let me in!
That's not going to help.
Put on your shoes. We'll meet you in the car.
Sadie hurt me!
I didn't!
Hit her back!
She's faking!
 I'm not!
Go downstairs.
 Stop crying!
 Stop crying!
Stop it!
God damn it!
 Open the door! Open it!
Forget it.
No. Don't forget it. Don't forget it. Don't. Oh, god.
Hey, Boychik.
That's the eleven o'clock from London.  Drop something valuable, you shit.  How are you?
That's loud.
Every eight minutes, buddy.
You look pretty good. Your hair is different.
Yeah, I'm growing it out.
I'd get it cut.
Daddy, you never play with me.
I do but right now look who I'm talking to. It's your brother.
You don't look like my brother.
I told you honey, that's because of the egg donor. Remember?
I came from a test tube.
How's business?
It's not good. Nobody wants curtains. They think of it like a luxury. It's not a luxury. You need shade, you need privacy. Who wants to have other people watch you fuck?
I know how you feel. You know my business is going through some growing pains right now.
Daddy come play with us.
Be careful, don't jump on Daddy. Remember, Daddy has high blood what?
Blood pressure.
That's right. Can you go outside without me for a little bit? 
All right? Do the Three Stooges routine you were practicing.
I can't tell them apart. I swear to god. I need tattoos.
Look, I wanted to talk to you about scaling back a little bit. You know, Deb and I are thinking about selling the house.
I think that house is more than you need. I think it was too big of a purchase when you made it.
Yeah. In the meantime, I'm going to have to make some changes. Going to have to cut back.
What do you mean?
With you.
Oh. I'm sorry, what?
I can't lend you any more money.
No, that's a bad idea. That's not the way to cut back. I have three children, here.
What about Claire? Why can't she get a job?
Claire takes care of your brothers. What do you want her to do? If she goes to work, then I've got to hire somebody.
Well you've got to figure something out because I can't do it.
Okay, fine. Why don't we kill them? Come on, we'll kill two of them. I'll keep the best one. Really, it will save us both a lot of trouble.
Line up! Line up for murder! Come on! Who wants to be killed?
I do!
Okay, we're eliminating one, we're cheaper already.
Murder me!
Boom, dead. You're dead.
I'm dead!
All right, the kids are murdered. That will save us some money.
Why would you have three kids, anyway? I mean, you're sixty years old. You have no money.
Because Claire wanted a baby. If we didn't at least try, she would have left me. She was forty-five years old. Nobody thought it would take. 
The doctor when we were doing in vitro was winking at me like, "Don't worry, don't worry." We were very unlucky. And now we have these three beautiful children... Come on, I've got to tell you something.
What?
Your mother wanted you aborted.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
It's the truth. It was the seventies. We were twenty-two years old. That's what everybody did. You did some blow, had sex, had an abortion.
Really.
Yes. We were on the way to the doctor's office. I said, "Let's stop, have a pizza, talk about it, if you still want to do it after lunch, it's okay." The pizza saved your life. But don't give me money. Because I'm not worth it.
So how much do I owe you for saving my life?
I don't have a number. You just keep giving like you're giving.
Oh, hi Pete.  Why aren't you playing with kids?
We were playing with them all day. Pete's just talking to me about his fortieth birthday party... Whatever I can do to help.
Okay. Did you feed them?
I fed half of one. Okay, let's feed them. Who wants tuna with a side of jet fuel?
Hi, I'm looking for my dad, an older man?
So how's Sony treating Pete?
Oh, he's not with Sony anymore. He went out on his own. Now he's able to focus on the artists that he's really passionate about.
How's Sadie doing? Last time I saw her she was throwing her Cheerios on the floor. What a mess.
She just got her period.
Well. I guess she's not a little baby anymore.
It would be nice to see more of each other.
Well, we can certainly arrange for that. I'd love to see the girls.
That would be nice. Do you have a good day?
I would say the weekends, but our weekends are hell. Soccer competitions, kids exams. I mean, we're both so busy. I have young children, you have young children. I don't think we should judge ourselves too harshly about that.
I know, I wasn't. I'm glad we're here. I think this is a good start and that if we can spend more time together, it would be nice.
It would be nice.  Do you want to see pictures of the kids?
This is Kell, my son.
He's handsome. He's thirteen?
Yeah. And that's Alexandra, my daughter, she's a real perfectionist. A lot like you. That's the whole gang at Cabo.  Will you excuse me, dear? I've got to use the restroom. Be right back.
Daddy and I are making some changes so that we can be happier and healthier, and we're starting with this meal that I prepared.
I think it looks great.
Doesn't it look good?
What is that, grilled cheeses?
No, baked tofu. It's actually really tasty. And the lettuce is so fresh and tasty that you forget how good lettuce tastes on its own without dressing.
Yeah, dressing always gets in the way of the natural taste of the lettuce.
And another thing we've decided is to cut back on all of the electronics we use. What we're going to do is get rid of the wi-fi and only use the computer from eight to eight-thirty at night.
How are we going to go on the computer?
We're going to have a hard line in the kitchen.
Yeah, we'll supervise that.
You can't do this. You can't take away the wi-fi.
 No wi-fi! Ha-ha-ha!
You don't spend enough time with the family when you're constantly on your iPhone and your computer. You're only here five more years.
So you won't see me after five years?
No, but you won't be living with us. And you should get to know your little sister.
You've got the perfect friend right here.
I don't want to be friends with her now. I'll be friends with her when she's twenty and a normal person.
I don't want to hang out with her when I'm in my twenties.
You're on your computer too much as it is. You need to get outside more.
Yeah. You can build things. You can build a fort.
What?
Yeah, build a fort. Play with your friends.
Make a fort?! Outside? And do what in the fort?
When I was a kid we used to build tree houses and play with sticks.
Nobody plays with sticks.
You and Charlotte can have a lemonade stand.
Play Kick the Can.
Look for dead bodies.
It's fun.
Get a tire and then take a stick and run down the street with it.
Nobody does that crap. It's 2012.
You don't need technology.
No technology!
Charlotte, put that down.
I don't need to be monitored all the time on the computer. I don't do anything bad.
Nobody said you were bad.
I don't do things I'm not supposed to. I don't illegally download music. I don't look at porn like Wendy.
She is up to no good. She's not allowed to come over here anymore.
What's porn?
No, she said "corn."
This isn't turning out the way I wanted it to.
I'm not hungry.
No computer.
Listen to your mom.
I need to use it for my homework.
She's outplaying us.
I know. She's tough.
This is the best birthday present.
It's good to get away, you know? We haven't been to Laguna without the kids in years.
I know!
If we're happy, they're happy.
I mean I can't take it. With the hormones, and the crying, and "do my homework"...
Them's little bitches.
Them's lil' bitches! Bugging us for shit all the time. And they never appreciate anything.
God no. They're selfish assholes.
 Aw, I feel bad. I love them.
I know.
I miss them already. Should we go home?
Nah.
Why do we fight?
I don't know, it makes no sense at all.
It makes no sense.
When we get in a fight, look in my eyes. Let's remember this moment right now and know that we never have to fight.
But you're such a dick sometimes.
I know, I am a dick sometimes. People think I'm so nice, but I'm such a dick.
Thank you for admitting that.
And you get so mad at me. I feel like you want to kill me.
I do want to kill you.
How would you do it?
I don't know... poison you. I'd poison your cupcakes that you pretend not to eat everyday. And just put enough in to slowly weaken you.
I love it.
I would enjoy our last few months together.
Me too.
Because you'd be so weak and sweet, and I could take care of you but while killing you.
See? You know what I love about us? You can still surprise me. I figured for sure you'd knock me out with one fell swoop. But you would extend it over a series of months.
Have you ever thought about killing me?
Oh, yeah.
Really?
Sure.
How would you do it?
Wood chipper.
A wood chipper?
Did you see Fargo?
Yeah.
Wow. That's a bad plan. The cupcakes is a way better plan.
It is. You know what? I won't murder you.
Aw. I love you.
I love you too... Hey. You know what I brought?
What?
A medical marijuana cookie. Ben gave it to me last Christmas.
What?
Chocolate chip koo-kie.
Should we do it?
Let's eat the cookie, and then we'll order a bunch of cheeseburgers. Let's order the entire room service menu.
Just get all of it. You deserve it. You really do.
Wouldn't you rather have me around for less years and I'm incredibly happy than longer and miserable?
Yes, and I just realized that right now. Go get the cookie!
Should we watch porn when we eat the cookie?
Should we get a block of porn?
I don't think we need twenty-four hours of porn.
Yeah, but you know, two porns cost about as much as a block.
I think that's too much porn.
We don't have to watch it all, but for the value it makes sense.
How much are we supposed to eat?
I don't know. I think like six or seven cookies, right?
Plus, it's old. It probably has lost some of its-
Potency?
We should have sex. More.
I mean, girls have it so easy. You just show up with your sexual organs and you're good to go. All the pressure is on the guy.
It's true.
And I look at guys, like I look at a guy like Prince, and you know that guy fucks. I know I don't fuck like Prince. Prince can fuck. I fuck more like David Schwimmer.
You do.
I fuck like Ross from Friends.
How does he do it? The floating spoon.
Check it out. My dick and balls. I'm going to eat my own dick!
I ate my dick!
I think this room has rodents. I just saw it!
Have you seen my starfish? Where did I put my starfish?
I'm going to deep throat this eclair.
I want to make out with you so bad.
That was nice.
That was nice.
Mom! Charlotte's crying. She's got an ear infection again.
I didn't know what to do.
 We're home.
Are you okay? What's the matter?
I just want to rip my ear off, it hurts so much.
 I told you the pediatrician didn't know what he was talking about.
Oh, come on. You can't blame it on our doctor. Ear infections are common in little kids.
Not in kids over six years old. We're going to the Eastern doctor.
If she's in this much pain, we should call a real doctor.
Are you kidding right now?
Okay.
What we should do is easy and simple. No more dairy, no more wheat, no more sugar.
Sugar, wheat and dairy. Okay.
 What the fuck is left? Sorry. Isn't everything sugar, wheat and dairy?
She can have vegetables and f-r-ruits.
Oh, she can eat fr-r-ruits.
Fr-r-ruits, yes.
Any kind of fr-r-ruits?
Mangos, pineapple...
It isn't like there are safe fr-r- ruits and then unsafe fr-r-ruits.
No, no.
What about F-r-r-rench f-r-r-ries? Can we do something like that?
Are you okay? Would you like to come on the table?
I'm okay.
Why don't you go on the table?
No.
Why don't you go on the table? It looks like you need to get on the table.
I don't want to get on the table.
Pete!
What are you doing?
I need you to look at something. In my butt.
Why?
I think I've got something in there, and I'm not limber enough to see. I need you to look at it. I might have like an anal fissure or a hemorrhoid or a worm or something.
What are you doing with your phone?
Trying to take pictures of it, so I can compare it to something on Google.
Can we just keep like a small shred of mystery in our relationship?
Look, I saw you have two babies, okay? Seriously, I need you to get all up in that.
I do not want to investigate your anus.
It's payback time.
It's a hemorrhoid.
Thank you. Now erase that from your memory.
Where did she get those clothes? Those are expensive.
Where do you think? I don't want this to sound harsh, but everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie. Everything that comes into it is a dick.
Everything that goes in is dicks?
A dick.
Don't say that.
I'm sorry, I'm just being protective of the store.
I'm going to go talk to her.
Hey Desi. Is that your new Acura out front?
Uh, yeah.
It's so nice. Do you love it?
Well, I mean, it's not a fucking Porsche, but it'll do for now.
Hey Desi, would you mind wearing some of the clothes we have in the store?
Yeah, sure. I'm sorry.
Good?
You know, I actually made this one myself.
Did you?
Yeah. I did the tiger on a piece of paper separately, and then I transferred it to the t-shirt.
Wow. So you stenciled on the tiger?
I drew it on a piece of paper, and then I transferred the drawing to the t-shirt.
You have an amazing body.
Really?
Yes. Are those real?
My boobs? Yeah... Do you want to touch them?
Really?
Touch `em!
Okay.
Wow. Jesus. I mean they really are amazing. That's firm, for real. They're like a memory mattress. Like Tempurpedic, you know? They look amazing. My kids just sucked the meat right out of mine.
No. There's some meat in there.
Since I had kids, my boobs are just gone. They didn't even say goodbye. They just left.
By the time I'm forty, these are going to go National Geographic on me.
I feel bad about myself right now.
I think this is a really good offer on the house.
We expected more. I mean, I know it's a bad market but that's still way under what we were looking for.
I know, but based on the market, it's like you're gaining money. Because it's so much more than what you deserve. But these people are from Iran and they don't really know that they're offering too much. Is there any chance that Debbie will go for it?
I doubt it. I don't know.
There's a lot of inventory out there. What's her problem?
She has unrealistic expectations.
Did you miss me Travis?
It's Jack!
Hey, Jack.
My daddy doesn't know my name.
Can I go show them my crystals before they leave?
Yeah, really quick.
Go play with your tiny uncles.  So, what are you doing, spring cleaning?
I'm getting rid of everything in the house that has gluten or sugar.
Why? What's wrong with gluten?
Gluten's really bad for you.
I don't think so. It's wheat.
Don't you watch Dr. Oz?
As in the Wizard of?
Hey, Mom. We were wondering if we could use the computer to iChat.
Remember the rules? Eight to eight- thirty?
Yeah, but I have a friend over.
Hi Wendy. Why don't you guys go play? You could go build a fort!
Remember the Alamo?
Have you ever built a fort, Wendy?
Like on Facebook?
I will take this if you're going to throw it away, because at our house, we're wheat eaters.
But don't you want to live long enough to see your kids grow up?
That's up to god, honey.
But that's really not good for the kids.
The kids eat grass. This is fine.
Wendy's mom lets her go on whenever she wants.
My mom's pretty cool about it as long as I finish my homework.
Yeah. Well, I guess I'm not the cool one. But the rules are just different in our house.
But I get better grades than Wendy.
She does. She's so smart.
Let me just grab the candy worms.
Your rules are ridiculous.
Don't sass me.
I'm only sassing you because you're throwing out all the food in our house and I'm freaking starving. You're being stupid.
Wendy, can you go stand in the other room, please?
Yeah.
 Mom.
Give me your iPhone now.
The nougat things are good.
I have all my contacts in there.
Okay, if you don't give me your phone right now, then I'm going to have to take away your phone and your computer.
Jesus Christ--
That's it.
I need my computer to do homework.
No phone, no computer.
This is B.S. This is a bunch of F- ing S. You're acting like a B.
Kids! Time to go!
You go to your room right now.
 You are not allowed to use iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, iTunes, Netflix, Pandora, or Spotify!
She's a little pip. Just like her mommy. So I might have a job tomorrow, at least I'm going to go try to give an estimate. Do you mind taking the kids for a couple hours?
 Okay.
This is nice. You and I don't spend enough time together, do we?
We spend enough time together.
We do?
It's quality time.
Then we do. I'll go with what you think.
What else did they say?
Some kid named Joseph--
I know Joseph.
You do? He's making a "Hot or Not" list.
What?
So, Sadie said, "That's so   lame and immature that you're doing   that." And then Joseph says, "Yo,   girl. We're just having some fun   so don't be a bitch, yo."
That is not nice.
So, then Sadie said, "Don't call me a bitch." And Joseph said, "I didn't call you a bitch, I said don't act like a bitch. And by the way you're in the `Not Hot' column."
Who made him the judge of hot?
Do you realize what that could do to her self-esteem?
What a little fuckhead. I'll kill him.
So then Sadie said, "You're in the jackass column. I've got to go. I'm bored of you."
That is cool. That's taking the high road.
For some reason, there's an emoticon of a panda doing push-ups.
I wonder what that means.
I don't think it means anything, I think it's just adorable.
Aww. She's a good girl. She was polite, and she stood up for herself.
That's pretty cool.
What?
Shit. I thought she was coming in.
Oh my god, that scared me to death.
If she caught us, she would kill us.
I've got to make a call.
 We sold how many?
Six hundred and twelve album downloads.
Wait a minute. There are no zeros after that?
There are zeros, but all of them are before six hundred and twelve. There are none after.
How is that even possible?
Out of three hundred million Americans, six hundred and twelve people chose to download the album. You could personally call everyone who bought this record.
We're fucked! Here's the deal. I want you to meet me tomorrow morning at eight o'clock. I want a list of at least thirty ideas of what we can do to change this. 
We have to change this. I started a record label because I couldn't get a job, so I have no other options.
What financial problems?
Well, for one thing, you were right, you are missing about ten thousand dollars from the store. And then, Pete's record not selling well.
I thought we weren't supposed to hear for three weeks?
We heard.
You heard.
And they're bad. You know, it's that, and it's the money that he's been lending to his father, that's creating a strain.
How much have we lent him?
Eighty thousand.
Did you say "eight thousand" or "eighty thousand"?
Eighty thousand, over the past couple of years. And then you missed the mortgage payment--
On the house?
And you missed the rental on the office.
Does Pete know that?
Oh, yeah. We're on the phone all the time. Look, I know you're going through a hard time, and I want you guys to know that we're here for you, okay? Anything you guys need, that's why we're here. We're here for times like this.
What are you going to do?
There's not much I can do.
What are you doing?
I'm drawing the album cover for Van Halen's Diver Down.
If you spent a little bit more time focusing on Graham Parker instead of drawing album covers, I wouldn't be in this predicament.
I'm focused on Graham Parker.
You're supposed to help me with him! 
You're supposed to call the companies, you're supposed to get people to the show!
I've done everything I can, Pete. You had me pushing around a corpse. It was like being in fucking Weekend at Graham's.
What should we do? I'm out of ideas.
You fly in The Rumour. I can't sell a reunion concert without the band. It's ridiculous.
With what? I can't afford it.
You put this on yourself. You wanted the responsibility, take it on the chin, and stop acting like a bitch.
What did you call me?
Chin.
Pete -- wait. I have an apartment, I have health insurance, I have car payments. I have responsibilities.
Don't talk to me about responsibilities. I have a life. I have a family. I can't afford to sit in my apartment getting high, jerking off, and then going to Tommy's Chili Burgers at three in the morning.
That's not even the order that happens in!
I have everything to lose here. Everything.
Yes. Because you spent thousands of dollars on shit we don't need. You really need to spend thirty thousand dollars on a fucking neon sign, dude? Which is inside? It's not even outside. We know where we work.
If you want to sign a band, you have to look like you're the real deal.
 Princess Labia, how much is it to fly The Rumour in?
It's twelve thousand.
Twelve thousand dollars!
You know what? Fine. Fly in The Rumour. Put it on my AmEx.
No, you said it was impossible.
I don't think I said it was impossible.
Yeah.
I usually don't say impossible. I like to leave some wiggle room.
You said that my fibroid was like a giant boulder, like the one from the Indiana Jones movies blocking up my uterus.
And I need to stop using that reference of Indiana Jones. I think that's not appropriate when talking about the reproductive system.
It's okay.
Anyway, somehow the Eastern medicine has worked and the fibroid has dissipated.
That's great.
Yes. Your fibroid shrunk, and somehow it allowed you to get pregnant.
What?
You're going to have your third baby. Congratulations.
No.
Yes.
Would you like some water?
That's good news. Another baby, at forty.
Debbie?
I am thrilled. And Pete is going to be so happy.
So, you're okay?
What a relief. I can finally relax now, you know? I'm so happy, I really am. It's good.
Great. Great.
Hey, why are you in a bathrobe? It's the middle of the afternoon.
I took a late shower. Why are you busting my balls? Look, I'm sorry about the record. You're going through financial shit. This is what I live with. This is a horrible time in human history. What is that?
Something that might help both of our situations.
This is a drawing by John Lennon. I got it ten years ago for five thousand dollars. I don't know how much it's worth now. Could be five, could be twenty.
I don't want this. I don't even like it. I'm not going to hang it up.
It's not for you to hang up. It's for you to sell. That way I can give it to you and you can make some money, and Debbie doesn't know that I'm giving you anything.
Well, you're not giving me money. You're giving me a project. I don't know how to sell this. I'm not an art dealer.
Just sell it online. Do some research, make some calls. Or is that too hard to do with your high blood pressure?
All right. Don't get snippy. Just because you write a great song doesn't mean you can draw.
It's incredible. John Lennon drew it.
I think it's a Ringo. Don't beat me up if I get three hundred dollars for it.
Don't take less than sixty-five hundred for that. It's very valuable. It's important to me. I want you to sell it so I can help you.
Okay.
I'll see you at my party.
What should I bring? You want wine or something?
No. Don't buy wine with my money and give it to me at my party.
That's mean.
I love you. Bye.
All right. Bye... How do I call eBay?
She's so cute. She's so tall.
I know. How did that happen?
Do you ever wish we had a bigger family?
No, never for a second. Never.
Never?
Never. I love what we have. One? A breeze. Two? Brutal. Three? Put a bullet in my head.
I think about that gray-haired pregnant lady from school and I just feel bad for her. And I feel bad for the kid. Can you imagine? All the other little kids, "Where's your mommy?" "Oh, she's the one sitting in that scooter eating a soft cracker." Kids don't want to have old parents. You know, it would also be nice for us to spend some time apart. Kind of rediscover who we are individually. It would be so great to not see you for like a chunk of time so that I could really just miss you. Remember when we used to miss each other?
Hey!
Yo, sup?
I'm Sadie's mom.
Sadie...?
Sadie, the one you chat with on the internet?
Nah, man. That ain't me.
Well, it was you, I saw your picture. Did you make a "Hot" list and not put Sadie on the "Hot" list?
She was not on my list, no.
You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to make my own "Hot" list, and you know what? You're on the "Not Hot" list. How does that feel?
It doesn't bother me. I'm comfortable with the way I am.
Maybe you shouldn't be so comfortable with yourself. You know why? You look like a miniature Tom Petty. How's that feel? Huh? You think that haircut's cool? It's not. It looks like you put your Justin Bieber wig on backwards. You still comfortable with yourself? Why are you wearing a tank top? Huh? So you can show off your bald pits, you little hairless wonder? Cool tank top, man. So next time you think about writing something nasty on my daughter's Facebook page, just remember me. Remember me. I will come down here, and I will fuck you up.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Wait a minute. Hey. Are you crying?
Just let me go.
I'm sorry. I'm not in my right head.
I understand. My mom is going through menopause, too. It's a hard time.
What did you say?
You're going through menopause?
I'm not going through menopause! I'm not going to go through menopause for twenty years. I'm pregnant you little bitch. God damn it!
I'm going out to coffee with Desi to find out if she's stealing from us.
I've got the Graham Parker concert. Who's gonna watch the kids?
I don't know. Figure it out.
I just wanted to talk. Maybe we could go to a coffee house or something?
You want coffee? This place has coffee. They have all kinds of drinks.
What sport do you guys play?
We play hockey.
Oh, I like hockey.
Who do you guys play for?
We play for the Philadelphia Flyers.
You guys are all from Philadelphia?
No, actually none of us are.
Do you guys still have all of your teeth?
Do I look sexy?
So, should we go to the quiet area?
No, no.
We kind of have to have a little business meeting tonight.
Business meeting? You have to celebrate with us. We won tonight.
I want to party with these winners, come on Deb.
 Okay. Let's fucking dance! Yeah!
Thank you so much for coming, this is so exciting! For the first time in over thirty years, Graham Parker and The Rumour.
 Where are his fans? Where are they?
It's hard to watch a band when you know all of them remember D-Day.
What's press turnout like?
Are you serious? Nobody came.
Nobody is here?
Oh, the guy from Green Day is here.
Yeah, Billie Joe, I emailed him. He's a fan.
You've got to get a photo of the two of them.
No, he says he doesn't want to do any press, he's just watching the show.
Oh, how punk rock of him. "I don't like photographs."  Grow up, Green Day!
Shut up, Tom Selleck.
I wouldn't call them classically good dance moves, but you left it all out there. You're a blast to dance with.
Thank you.
We're having a little shindig at the hotel after this, you should come by and hang out.
You want me to come to the hotel?
Yes. I want you to come by the hotel with me.
Well, what would we do there?
Maybe we can find somewhere quiet, have fun, and see where it goes. Like adults do sometimes.
Like, sex?
I mean, if you want. If that's on the docket. I'm not trying to force that.
So you would do sex with me?
Do sex? What are you, Borat?
Are you hitting on me?
Yes. I'm hitting on you. You're hot and cool and nice and you have beautiful eyes.
I'm sorry. I'm married, I have two kids, and I'm pregnant.
That is what we call the "hat trick." Wow.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I'm just really enjoying you being so nice to me.
I hope this doesn't come off as super cheesy, but I think you're a very rare find.
Thank you.
And I would totally do sex with you.
 That was spectacular guys, really well done.  Hey, Graham.
Pete! How are you, man?
Well, the first numbers came in.
Happy? How's it looking?
About half of your last record.
Ah, so you were expecting it to sell. They never sell anymore. They used to sell. But now they don't. I'm not a sexy sixteen-year-old girl.
But I wanted to sell it. It's such a good record. I feel like I let you down.
No, I'm going to be fine. My overheads are so low. I just got a song in Glee. 
Guy in the wheelchair is going to sing it to the Asian girl, I believe. I don't know, I've never seen the show, but that's what I'm told. Secret is, make sure you have a small nut. That's the key to life.
Graham, I don't have small nuts, all right? I have big nuts. And I need to provide for them.
Graham, hey, what's up?
Billie!
How you doing, man? Great show. I'm inspired. I want to write a song right now.
Inspired, huh? That inspires me.
Let's go get a drink.
Let's get a drink.
 You coming?
No. I'm fine. You guys go. Congratulations on Glee.
You got a song on Glee? That's killer, man. That's so much money, that's good for all of us.
Why did you put that guy's teeth in your mouth? That's so gross. He was dirty.
No, he was wearing a tie.
That's true.
When I kissed him, I felt his little tiny teeth nubs with my tongue.
You did?
It was like kissing a baby. French kissing a baby.
Can I ask you something stupid? Do you know why we're missing money at the store?
Are you guys missing money?
Like twelve thousand dollars.
Wait. Do you think I took it?
Well, no. I did, but now I don't.
It's not me.
Then, why do you live in such a nice apartment and have such a fancy car?
Yes, you're right. Look. I... am an escort. I get paid to go out on dates.
But only three to five times a year. Ten times max. But it's not technically "prostitution" because I don't have to sleep with them.
Well, that's good.
But I always do. That's why I only do it four to eight times a year, fifteen times max.
Huh.
One year I did it twenty.
As long as you think it's safe.
It's safe. I only do it ten to thirty times a year.
So, who do you think is stealing money?
It's Jodi.
No.
Yeah. She's a pilled-out whore.
Since you told me, I want to tell you something.
You're pregnant.
How did you know?
Wow. Maybe you should tell Pete.
You didn't tell Pete yet? Why not?
I don't know. I just want him to want me. I don't want him to want me because I'm pregnant.
Go home and suck his dick and tell him then and he will love it.
You think?
He'll be so excited. Or even better yet, you should tell him while you're sucking his dick.  "I'm pregnant."
What are you doing?
I'm returning some emails.
What time do you have to go to work?
Like ten minutes ago.
Want to be late?
 No, I can't be late. Not today.
Do you see me? Standing here in front of you? Half-naked?
Yeah.
And does that make you feel anything?
Come on. Are you trying to start a fight?
No, I'm not trying to start a fight with you. I'm trying to fuck you!
Oh god, you know what? Today of all days you need to give me a break, all right?
Whatever.
I didn't realize it was intentional! I didn't say anything because I didn't want you to be embarrassed. I thought I was being gallant.
All right, fine, I'm an asshole.
You know what your problem is? You're never in the moment, you're never present. You're never in your body.
That's not true. I am in the moment. You know how I know? I want to get the fuck out of the moment. I swear, I can't win with you.
You can't just walk away.
How's the record company going, Pete?
What? Not great. I'm still waiting for numbers to come in.
What have you heard?
A couple numbers have trickled in. It's lower than we expected.
Then why are you giving Larry money?
What?
I know everything. I talked to the accountant.
All right, you know what? I don't want to get into some nasty fight. So can we please talk to each other like the therapist told us to talk to each other?
Fine. It makes me feel sad when you are dishonest.
I understand it makes you feel bad when I am dishonest with you. 
It hurts my feelings when you treat me with contempt and corner me and try and trick me into lying.
Okay. It makes me sad when it's so easy to trick you into lying because you're such a lying shitbag.
You can't do that. The therapist said you're not allowed to judge me.
That's not a judgment. That's just a fact.
Fair enough. Sometimes I withhold truth, that is true. But it's only because I'm scared to death of your crazy-assed illogical overreactions.
Well, it hurts me inside and triggers me that you're such a dishonest shit that you're lending your father money without telling me, while your record company is going bankrupt and we're on the verge of losing our fucking house!
What else are you lying about?
I've taken Viagra for two years. I ate six muffins downstairs a while ago and my cholesterol level is 305. My heart could explode at any second. These might be my very last words. 
And I gave Charlotte antibiotics when you weren't looking. That's why her ear got better. So, go fuck your witch doctor.
What are we even doing? This is not making me happy. You're not happy. You don't like me. I can feel that. I'm not blind. Jesus. We're like business associates. We're like brother and sister. There's no passion there.
We're not like brother and sister. You know what we're like? We're like Simon and Garfunkel, and somehow you turned me into Garfunkel.
I don't even know what that means.
Art Garfunkel.
What's wrong with Art Garfunkel? He has a beautiful voice.
He's got an amazing voice. He could put a harmony to anything, but what I'm saying is that you turned me into him.
What the hell are you talking about?
Simon controls him.
That's because Simon writes the fucking songs! He's the better one.
You know what? I see the way you look at our kids. You have so much love and compassion for them. You never look at me like that. Ever.
Would we even still be together if I didn't get pregnant fourteen years ago?
I'm not going to go down that road.
Would we?
Okay.
You know what? I don't even want to have a party here. You need to cancel it.
No, I'm not. I already paid for the catering, I put down deposits, and I`m not going to call everybody back in two days when change your mind.
Can you please stop licking your fingers?
Do you know how many germs are on your hands? And you're putting them into your mouth. It's gross. Stop.
I'm going to kill you!
Hey! Sadie, enough! She isn't hurting anyone. If you want to say something, keep your mouth shut.
You have never been nice to her and now she's getting aggressive with you. I told you this would happen.
I'm sick of everybody fighting.
What do you think you're going to be like when you grow up?
I don't know.
Do you think you want kids?
Just one.
Just one? Why?
Because if I have two then the one will fight with the other one.
Does it make you sad when you fight?
I don't want anyone to fight.
I love you.
Why isn't anybody talking? Why is it so quiet?
It's the sounds of silence.
 I don't think that I can really survive... I'm praying for the end of time, it's all that I can do. Praying for the end of time, so I can end my time with you.
Stop, Dad.
It was long ago and it was far away, it was so much better than it is today.
How many of those are you going to eat?
As many as I want.
I'm going to tell Mom on you.
Try it. See what you get for Christmas. Nothing. Snitches wind up in ditches. Remember that.
Peter!
Hey.
Catherine. I'm Joseph's mother.
 Oh, right. No, I know. Hi, Catherine.
Our kids have gone to school together for eight years.
Sorry.  Hello, Joseph.  
I hear our kids have been chatting online.
Yeah? I heard that your wife has been screaming at my son and I don't appreciate it.
Excuse me?
She screamed at my son.  Right? She threatened you?  She cursed at him. He's thirteen years old for god's sake. What the hell is the matter with her? You better check her meds and get them right.
Okay, why don't you back the fuck off, because that's my lovely, sweet wife you're talking about.
Oh, I need to back off?
Yeah, you need to back off because your kid is an animal. Why don't you put him on a leash?
 Turn around!
If he insults my daughter again, I'm going to hit him with my car. Got it? In fact, if you insult my wife again, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to show up at your house when you're sleeping, and I'll take your iPad and your iPod or your iMac and I'll shove them up your fucking iCunt. I've got nothing to lose. Your kid is the problem. My kid is a fucking angel. I don't have time for this shit. 
So I'm keeping it together. But if I wasn't at school right now...
Don't touch me.
I didn't touch you.
You touched my upper breast!
I didn't. I got right below your shoulder.
You got right here.  He hit my nipple!
You what?
You're insane.
Why would you do that?
Did you just touch my mom's nipple?
He just touched my nipple! Why would you do that?
I poked you on the shoulder.
I have very high nipples.
I touched your shirt.
What do you think is under my shirt? My breasts are under my shirt.  He just touched my breast.
Your shoulder, your shoulder.
That's a funny place to put a shoulder. My boob!
Hello! There are children around.
This isn't over. You're going to be sorry.  Let's go!
Why the fuck would you believe Desi?
You just admitted it.
Did I?
You stole twelve thousand dollars from me, Jodi, and I need you to pay me back.
Can you at least give me a referral?
You babysat my kids while you were on Oxycontin.
Oxycotton.
Oxyconton?
Oxykitten.
What's oxykitten?
Meow.
Jodi. You put me in danger. Me and my family.
It was a cry for help. Help.  Help. Why don't you help me? Just help. Help. Why don't you help me?
Are you high right now?
 Help me.
Is that about me? Is that the cops? Is this a set-up?
I need to go.
Okay, see you later.  Fuck you, Debbie. Fuck. You.
Joseph was very upset when I spoke to him about this, so I thought it was important that we join together and work this through.
Absolutely.
We're going to work through it, but Debbie told my son that he looked like Tom Petty, in a negative way--
Who's Tom Petty?
You know who Tom Petty is. And she said that if she had to come back, that she was going to "F up his pussy ass." Which is what she said.
Are you serious? I didn't. I would never. To a child? Your son has been defiling my daughter's Facebook page now for months.
These people are liars. He said that my son was an animal and that if I didn't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car.
Did you say that?
That's ridiculous. Who talks like that?
You do.
He didn't say that.
He said it. To me.
What I said was that we need to keep an extra eye on our kids because with all the technological advances, they need to learn to use them responsibly.
No. He called me an "iCunt."
A what?
Language, Catherine!
How am I going to relay what these two nutballs said to me unless I say it.
Can you please not talk like that, Catherine? Music Man is rehearsing next door.
Sorry, fucking Music Man. Maybe if I looked more like this fake bullshit couple, looks like they're in a bank commercial. That's what you look like. Like a bullshit bank commercial couple.
None of this talk is productive.
I'd like to rear up and jackknife my legs and kick you both in the jaw with my foot bone.
You're just really scaring me.
This is what happens when you corner a rat. You corner me, I will chew through you.
Catherine, you're better than this.
Fuck you, Jill. You're a horrible woman. This is why everybody hates you. This kind of shit. Ineffective. Bullshit hair. And I'm glad your husband died. Because you're a fucking asshole. He probably killed himself.
Okay, Catherine. I think we know what's happening now.
Now you know what we're dealing with.
I'm not going to eat that chicken.
Why not?
Because I feel like I'm going to be a vegetarian.
Can you become a vegetarian tomorrow?
No.
You guys have been reading my texts?
No, we haven't.
Yes, we have. We're supposed to keep an eye on you.
How did you find out?
Joseph told me that you flipped out on him and his mom and that you guys are nuts, and I agree.
Don't be disrespectful.
You're the ones who are disrespectful. Reading my texts is like reading my diary.
You were really sweet on your iChat. We were really proud of you.
Yeah, we were going to give you your computer and phone back.
Fuck you!
Okay, there's the first official "Fuck you."
That is not how we talk to each other in this house.
You guys talk to each other like that all the time! And to Joseph and his mom. You made Joseph cry.
Joseph has a crush on you. You like a boy who cries.
Shut up, Charlotte. You guys so desperately want me to be perfect and to make no mistakes. Well, you two are fucking insane.
Okay.
All you do is fight. Or you don't fight, which is even worse because it looks like you hate each other for weeks. You obsess over every little thing I do, and you don't trust in me or believe in me. Well, I'm fucking sick of it! Yeah, I said "fuck." Fuck fuck fuck. Ground me forever I don't care. I don't care about anything.  I hate everything, everyone's going crazy, I don't care if I have no friends.
Are you still upset about Lost?
Of course I'm upset about Lost! You guys took away my shit before I could watch the last two episodes! I don't know what the fuck happens!
She's becoming just like us.
I hope I never get my period if this is what happens.
Where did you find these?
I stole them.
Thank you.
No big deal.
Our kids are crazy. And it's our fault.
Do you think there's anything we can do to turn it around?
Sadie's thirteen. She might be a lost cause.
Where did she learn that kind of language? We don't talk like that.
I have no fucking idea... Do you think Sadie is this crazy because of us? Or is it hormones and Lost.
J.J. Abrams. He's ruining our daughter. That fucking geek.
I feel bad for us.
All of a sudden we're like a magnet for negativity. Why do people keep attacking us? What did we do? We're just doing our best.
Should we talk about our fight?
I think we're under enough pressure. Let's just let it go this time.
Yeah.
We can give each other a break.
Great. Thank you. And I'm sorry about my dad. You're right. I'm sorry that he's just an endless mooch.  The truth is, this isn't about us. It's about our parents.
We're not even mad at each other. We're mad at them.
Exactly.
Let's just take away our parents' power by loving them.
Can we do that?
Yes.
Thank god.
I kind of feel better already, do you?
I do.
I love you.
I love you too.
It's not us, it's them.
Totally.
What are you doing? We need to get ready for the party.
 I just finished the last episode of Lost.
We don't have time for this right now. We have a lot of people coming over--
 They're all dead.
What?
Jack, Kate, Sawyer...
I don't care about the show right now-
Jin, Sun...
Okay? I need you to just get in the shower. Get dressed. Let's just put it on hold.
Walt, Juliet. All those people.
Don't think about Lost today. Tomorrow: Lost. All day. I can't wait to hear about it. Jack? No way. Really? Right now, shower.
I don't make fun of your stupid Mad Men.
First of all, I don't get worked up over Mad Men.
That's because Mad Men sucks.
What Don Draper has gone through beats whatever Jack is running from on some island.
A bunch of people smoking in an office, it's stupid.
You're getting me off topic. Please get dressed.
I am so glad you're here. I need a buffer in case it gets weird.
Well, I'm ready to buff.
Here, grab these napkins.
So that's the girl who works for you.
Yeah, that's her.
Seems nice. My wife would never let me have a hot employee like that. 
Everyone that works for us looks like they've been in some kind of horrible accident.
You're comfortable with that around your husband?
Pete wouldn't know what to do with that.
You think our wives are looking at us right now?
Oh, definitely.
They look like pedophiles.
Hey, Pete!
Jason's here.
Peter, hi.
Hey, how's it going?
Great, you look well. How do you like what I've been doing to your girl? How do you like Debbie's after body?
It's nice.
Come on, show `em. Look at this.  It's beautiful. Look at that after- ass. Now it starts here, but it used to start here. And I brought it up. You're welcome.
Are you a trainer?
Yes, well, but not just physical. Spiritual. I'm sort of a guide.
You guys should talk. I think you'll get along. Come here, honey, I have to tell you something.
Who's that in the pool?
Mine.
Hello.
Hello, Debbie.
Remember my husband, Pete?
Oh, yes. I didn't recognize you with the long hair.
 I've been growing it.
Happy birthday.
Thank you so much.
Very old scotch.
Oh, wow. You know, I hope it hasn't expired.
No, scotch doesn't expire. It improves with age.
No, I know. Thank you so much.
What do you do in Chino, Oliver?
I am a surgeon.
Wow, what kind?
Mainly of the spine. My specialty is scoliosis surgery.
My mom used to talk to me like I had scoliosis because I'm a little hunchy, but that's a different thing.
Well, you definitely don't look right.
Hello everyone! I'm sorry we're late. I was in the lab cloning myself. We're going to have another seven more tomorrow... Look, we cut their hair different so we can finally tell who they are.
You like the new haircut, Travis?
I'm Jack, damn it.
Of course you are.
Larry, this is my father.
Really? How are you?
Oliver.
Oliver. "Can I have some more? Please, Oliver, I need a little morsel." I love that movie. You must get that all the time.
Not really.
I'm Claire, Larry's wife. Very good to see you, but excuse me, I'm going to go get the kids.
We won't see her now for the whole day. I'd help honey, but I've got the blood pressure, and I don't want to.
Dad, you want a drink?
Yeah, a little white wine.
White wine? Okay, heavy stuff.
So, who knew that Debbie had a dad! Where have you been for fifteen years? Never seen you at Hanukkah, Christmas, Ramadan, nothing. How do you get out of all that stuff? Do you have a wife?
My wife is at home.
Why didn't she come?
Construction. They're sanding our deck.
You let the woman sand the deck?
She supervises it, yes.
Hey guys.
Look how big the kids are. Sadie!
Hi, Larry.
 Hi, Sadie.
Mom. Who is Oliver?
What do you mean?
Is he your dad?
He is my biological father.
What does that mean?
He and my mom had a baby and that was me.
Oh, so you're our grandpa.
Why don't you ask your mother?
Yes, well, that would make him your grandpa. Do you want him to be?
Yes. Then we get another grandpa. Come on!
That was deeply uncomfortable. Thank god the pretty girl was here to divert our attention.
Oh, hi. I did not see you there.
I saw you there.
Did you guys come together? Are you a couple?
Sorry, the mustache is a little--
That's fair.
I just assumed.
This is a straight man mustache.
What is the different between a gay man's mustache and a straight man's mustache?
The smell.
Excuse me.
So, spinal surgery just seems to me to be at the top of the surgery chain.
Well, we're not cardio, we're not neuro, but I like to think we're an important part of the spectrum.
Do you operate every single day?
Most days.
Multiple times a day?
Three, four times.
So what's the price range? Like if I wanted--
Oh, I'd rather not say.
It's so big you're embarrassed to say.
I wouldn't say embarrassed.
Are there hunchbacks today?
Of course.
I've never seen one.
Well, that's because there are spinal surgeons.
That's because of you. Each time I don't see a hunchback, you're getting that much richer.
You like The Beatles, don't you?
Who doesn't like The Beatles?
Nobody.
So what's your sun sign?
Libra.
Oh, boy.
That's not good.
No, sir.
Not for me, that's not good. Sexually we are completely incompatible.
That's not true.
That's such a shame. That's as bad as it gets.
What's yours?
I'm a Cancer.
Really?
Is that good?
What does it mean?
That's really strange. Well, Taurus and Cancers are sort of soul mates of the Zodiac. We're like perfectly compatible. I balance what you lack, and you make up for what I lack. And a quiet Cancer almost always has a huge penis.
 You're making me embarrassed.
I wanted to make a toast. Thank you guys so much for coming... Pete's turning forty.
Weird.
And we're ready to start this new phase of our lives with open hearts. Ready to just choose joy and forgive everybody, so thank you all for coming.
Wait. Forgive who?
I think she just meant generally. You know? Put the past behind us.
And live without resentments.
But specifically who are you forgiving? I like to know the details before I toast.
Well, you and my dad and others.
I see. I know you have some issues with me, but I'm curious, what's he in for? Before today nobody even knew he existed.
My parents divorced when I was really young and we don't spend that much time together and I'd like to work on that. Just like we'd like to work on how you have financial issues.
 She means all the lending. And the borrowing...
I know what she meant.
You are a beautiful woman, but you are not totally maxed out. I would say honestly, you're a six. Six and a half. I could make you an eleven.
Really?
When I found Deb, she was a seven. And now she's a twelve.
I want to be a twelve.
You can't be lazy.
I don't want to be lazy.
Look at me. You cannot be lazy.
I won't be lazy.
Do you know how she got her body? Bodies By Jason.
Wow.
Say it.
Bodies By Jason.
Say it again.
Bodies By Jason.
And now just say Jason.
Jason.
Again?
 Jason.
That sounds right, doesn't it?
Yeah.
What the fuck is happening right now?
When was the last time you two saw each other, if you don't mind me asking?
Actually, we had lunch together last week.
And before that?
It's been about seven years.
Seven years? That's a joke, right? That's like two Olympics. And I'm the bad guy. What Debbie doesn't understand is that it's not bad to help out a parent. And it's certainly not bad for a parent to help out a child. I'm sure Oliver would agree.
Are you really doing this right now?
Am I doing what? I didn't start the toast.
Are you really about to hit up my dad for money?
What? He does four operations a day. It's perfect. It helps everybody, and it relieves his guilt from all the abandonment issues.
You can't buy forgiveness, right Pete?
I don't think anyone's looking for handouts... We'd pay him back.
If you two are in a bind I'd be more than happy to help.
No. It's not good to borrow money from family members because it causes resentment, remember?
Yeah.
What do you want me to do? Admit that my life is shit? Is that what you want me to say? You happy? Aren't I allowed a little joy with these children I never wanted to have?
You have never once stopped asking us for money.
Family helps family.
It's true. Family helps family. Look, I don't expect you to fully understand. Your dad left. You're broken inside. It's not your fault you can't feel love. There's something that you can't -- this is coming out wrong.
You know what? I would rather have my dad than your dad, because he doesn't drive me crazy. You know the best quality my father has? He asks for nothing. I don't know what the fuck he's thinking right now. Look at that. Nothing. I don't even know him. And I turned out perfectly fine without his input.
I just figured out what your problem is. You hate Jews. Which is so odd because your children are Jewish.
Don't play the Jew card, Larry.
I'm not playing any Jew card.
Seriously, it's used up.
You can't use up a Jew card. That's the whole point of a Jew card.
That's right. You can't use it up, it goes forever.
You know what? I have to go.
Great. What a big surprise. Bye Oliver. See you later. See you in another seven years. Make sure to say goodbye to the grandkids, who you met today. You know, nothing I do is right because of you? Nothing. No matter how hard I try, I'm just the asshole here, but you know what I realized? It's you. You're the asshole.
Good luck working that out. Happy birthday and go fuck yourself.
See you when the Cubs win the Pennant.
I'm going to light the candles. Get it going.
Maybe we should try the toast again.
Can you be quiet?  You just threw me under the bus.
No. We agreed to let go and forgive, but then you started ripping into my dad like a crazy person.
I'm not ripping into your dad. I'm just saying to him what you say to me.
Don't be such a ball buster.
I am not a ball buster. You make me one! I am a fun girl! I am fun- loving! I am a good time Sally! I dance hip-hop. I cannot believe I've wasted my whole life busting the balls of people who have no balls. I am the only one here who has any balls.
Mom?
Mom! What are you doing?
What?
You're smoking? In the front yard?
No, they're Barb's.
Mom! Since when have you been a smoker?
I'm not a smoker.
I thought you said smokers die.
I wasn't smoking.
I saw you.
Mom, you're smoking?
Deb, you can't smoke, you're pregnant. You've been doing so well.
You're pregnant?
No f-ing way. I don't want another sister.
I don't want her as a sister.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It just slipped out.
 Are you really pregnant? Since when are you pregnant?
Since when do you care? You don't want another baby.
You have no idea what I want.
I want an Asian baby.
We're not going to have an Asian baby.
Yes, we are!
They're not Asian.
Sadie.
We'll buy one.
Shut up, Charlotte.
You shut up!
Shut up, Sadie!
Shut up, Charlotte!
Shut up!
Okay, Sadie. Shut up.
Shut up, Charlotte!
Okay, stop saying shut up!
Since when are you pregnant? When did you find out?
Will you stop eating cupcakes, please! Stop eating cupcakes. Stop eating cupcakes!!
Hey! We just heard. You're having a baby! See, it can happen to anybody.
That is so wonderful. We're so happy for you.
 This is too adult for you. Let's go outside.
Well, I guess we're stuck together forever, then, right?
Weren't we always?
You don't even want a baby.
Of course I do. I never said that. Look, I didn't want one if I could choose.
I should put that on a Hallmark card. That's beautiful.
Good luck with the pregnancy, Debbie. But please, take care of yourself. It's a much riskier pregnancy after forty.
I'm not forty.
Of course you are. You were born on December 5th, 1972.
How do you know?
I was there. I'm the one who took your mother to the hospital.
That's not what she said.
Your mom was in labor for only twenty minutes. It was like you couldn't wait to meet me, can you imagine that?
I don't even know you. You can't just come into my house and reminisce.
 Look, maybe we were just not meant to be in each other's lives. I'm not sure this was such a great idea.
Hey, wait a minute. You did leave. And you didn't come back.
 My first life was ruined. I did my best with my second.
So I ruined your life? I was eight.
People do better when I stay out of their lives. That's what my son tells me. You think my life is so perfect? I've got a thirteen-year- old who's a pot head, I've got a wife who's keeping Zoloft alive.
You never said that before.
You don't think I want to talk to you about this? To share it with you? It's just not our way! We don't talk to each other, we don't know each other. I thought that's the way you wanted it. How do I get out of this? How do I get you all to just help me down off the cross?
You sound just like Sadie.
Who's Sadie? No. Your daughter, your younger?
The big one.
Your older. I know that! She's a wonderful girl.
Hi, guys. Some of us need to leave. Would this be a good moment to sneak out?
Where's Dad going?
Best birthday ever!
Bike lane, asshole!
Fuck you, you Twilight pimply-ass motherfuckers!
Your dad's still here.
I know. It's weird. Where the hell is Pete?
Mom, is it okay if Joseph hangs out here for a while?
Sure. Hi, Joseph.
Hi.
Do you want a piece of cake?
Oh, yeah sure. Thank you.
All right, then.
They are so cute.
So cute.
He looks exactly like Tom Petty.
Go around!
Watch it!
Hey, Pete. Great party!
Yeah. The best!
Then you shake it. And then a restaurant comes up.
Dad? Excuse me. I'm going to go look for Pete. Would you mind staying with the girls for just a little bit?
 Well, if you want me to.
If you don't mind. You don't have to.
Sure.  Can I let Sadie show me the last episode of Lost? She asked me if I'd seen it, I haven't.
That would be nice. Thank you.
Thank you.
 She said we could watch it.
I'm going to let you watch Lost. Come on.
Is it scary?
I'll cover your eyes if it gets too scary.
Are you mad at me? Did I say something?
Shh. Larry, please.
You opened your door on me.
I was right there! You are supposed to look before you open your door. I was in the fucking bike path.
Pay attention!
You're supposed to look to see if a biker is coming through. You're supposed to look!
No one is ever looking out for me!
Why?
Fuck you!
Why don't you pay for my bike -- and my face, you fucking prick!
Are you sure that's him? I don't think that's him.
 I'm going to write down your license plate number.
"Range Rover of Sunland."
What are you doing?
Ow.
I guess the party didn't turn out like you planned.
It wasn't a good party.
Hi. I'll bring you in as soon as his x-rays are finished.
Is he okay?
Yeah, he has a broken rib and he's been crying a little bit, but he'll be fine.
You know Pete was never a real fighter. But that's why he married you. That's why he loves you. Because you're the fighter, and you need that. One person in a relationship has got to punch.
Do you mean that in a good way?
Oh, it's a high compliment.
Thanks.
Listen, I know what you're worried about. You think he's going to turn into me, but I don't think it's going to happen. He's smarter and probably a little cuter. A little less Jewy. Although, after fifty, that's all going to change. Be prepared to wake up one day with a a rabbi. But the good news is, he'll love you forever. That's in our DNA. We stick around.
He worries about you. It puts a lot of pressure on him.
I know. I just don't have anyone else to talk to about it.
You can talk to Claire.
No. If I open up to her she'll leave me.
No, she won't, Larry, she loves you.
I know, but there's a certain point at which you just can't stay.  I guess it's hard to forgive somebody if they don't formally apologize to you.
Are you apologizing?
I'm very close.  Yes, I'm sorry. And I'm glad everybody's okay.
Thanks.
I'm off.
Okay.
This is awkward.
What?
I need forty dollars for a cab.
 That's funny.
No, I'm not kidding. You drove me. I wasn't prepared.
I only have a hundred.
That's okay. I'll bring you the change.
All right, give him a kiss for me.
I don't get it.
See, it's not sad, it's happy because they helped each other achieve their destiny.
Oh.
Great. I'm going to have some freaky ass nightmares.
I really liked our lives so much better before we tried to change everything. I'm sorry.
No. I'm sorry. I don't want to keep anything from you. I love you. You're my wife. I just didn't want to let you down.
Are you mad that I'm pregnant?
No. I'm not mad. I'm thrilled.
You don't feel trapped?
Sometimes I feel like I trapped you.
I don't feel trapped.
Really?
No.
You should, because I've trapped you. You can't go anywhere. I'm going to get you pregnant every ten years for the rest of your life. You can never leave me. Ever.
I never feel trapped by you. I'm so happy to be with you. I love you so much. You're my favorite person in the whole world. god damn it, why am I crying like this? Something is wrong with me.
You're pregnant.
Oh, yeah. Shit. I was just outside telling your dad that I liked him. What if he thinks I like him now?
No, he won't think that.
I don't want him to think I like him that much.
It'll never happen.
 Can you believe it? This is the craziest thing ever. What are we going to do with a third baby?
I have no idea. How are we going to afford it?
We'll sell the house.
We don't have to.
We kind of do.
We kind of do.
We'll make new memories in a new house.
I love you.
Is there anything you want to do for your birthday? It's been the worst birthday ever.
There is one thing, but I don't think you'll like it.
What?
I wouldn't mind going to see some music. Would you want to do that?
Yeah.
Really? I don't believe you, but you're sweet for saying that.
How do we break you out of here?
I can just leave on my own volition. It's not a mental institution.
Can you?
It's not like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Please don't put a pillow over my face.
Let's get out of here, McMurphy.
You got it, Chief. Will you carry me?
I like this song.
Really?
Yeah. Why?
Why don't you sign him?
Ryan Adams? No, he wouldn't sign with me.
Why not? You're the best.
Well, he is in between labels. Let's go try and talk to him after the show.
