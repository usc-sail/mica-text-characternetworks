Agnes!... Agnes...
I'm just going to put something here to stop the bleeding. Excuse me Sister. She'll be fine.
Here they are now.
Martha, it's you.
What about Roger? He's free.
They want a woman.
All you have to do is meet with her once or twice... then tell the court she's insane.
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
We're not telling you what to decide Martha. We're not even telling you to take this.
Is there any reason why you feel you shouldn't take it?
Today's my birthday. I always make bad decisions on my birthday.
Happy birthday.

Hi, it's Helen, calling to tell you that Mrs Davenport phoned to confirm her appointment at nine o'clock tomorrow, okay? Bye bye.
Hi Martha,    it's Roger. Can you call me at the    hospital. I'd like your opinion on a case.    Oh, bye the way, happy birthday.    Bye.
Hi, Marty it's Helen again. I cancelled your Wednesday afternoon appointment so you can visit with your mother. Bye bye.

Thank you. I um... I believe your Mother Superior's expecting me.
 Doctor Livingston I presume? I'm Mother Miriam Ruth. You needn't call Mother if you don't wish.  Most people find it uncomfortable.
Well... I...
 I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
Yes... I...
You can call me Sister.
... Thank you.
You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
They wouldn't understand, especially Sister Marguerite. She'd scare the pants off Queen Elizabeth.  Besides, I miss them.
You were a smoker?
Two packs a day.
I can beat that.
Unfiltered.
Well, you have questions.  Fire away...
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
No-one.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
Is that normal?
Yes.
How did she hide it during the day?
 She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
Didn't she have any physical examinations
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Who was the father?
I haven't a clue.
What man had access to her?
None as far as I know.
Was there a priest?
Yes, but I...
What's his name?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Could there have been anyone else?
 Obviously there was.
And you didn't try to find out who?
 Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
Why haven't you asked her?

 She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
Look, someone gave her the baby.
Yes, but that was some    ten months ago. I fail to see that the    identity of that somebody has anything    to do with this trial.
Why do you think that?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
The science of psychiatry.
 Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
 I am not with the Inquisition.
And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are! I don't want that mind cut open.
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
Yes.

You have a lovely voice.
No I don't.
I just heard you.
That wasn't me.
Was it Sister Marguerite?
You're very pretty Agnes.
No I'm not.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Let's talk about something else.
What would you like to talk about.
I don't know.
Anything... may I sit down?
Yes.
First thing that comes to your mind?
God!    But there's nothing to say about God.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Love.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Yes.
Who?
Everyone.
Well, who in particular?
Right now?
Uh huh.
I love you.
 Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Yes.
Who?
 Oh, there are so many.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Oh, yes!
Do you think he loves you?
Oh, I know he does.
He's told you?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
You've been alone together?
Yes.
Often?
At least once a week.
And you like that?
Oh, yes.
Where do you meet?
 In the confessional.
Agnes, do ever see Father Martineau outside the...
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Would you like to talk about it?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
Why should they?
I don't know.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
No. I was sick.
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
Where?
Down... there.
And what did you do?
I went to my room.
And what happened?
I got sicker.
I fell asleep.
In the middle of all the pain?
Yes.
Where did the baby come from?
What baby?
The baby they made up.
From their heads...
Is that where they say it came from... ?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Where'd it come from before that?
From God.
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
I... I don't understand.
Agnes, how are babies born?
Don't you know?
Yes I do,    but I want you to...
 I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants
Then let's talk about something else...
 No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
 Agnes...
 No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Would you like to ask them?
 What do you mean?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Anything?
 Anything.
What's your real name?
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
No.
Would you like to be?
Not at the moment, no.
Do you have any children?
No.
Would you like some?
I can't have them any more.
Why not?
 I've stopped menstruating
Why do you smoke?
Does it bother you?
No questions.
Smoking is an    obsession with me. Maybe one day    I'll become obsessed with something    else, then I'll stop smoking... Do    you have any more questions?
One.
What?
Where do you think babies come from?
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
Mummy wasn't very happy when she died ... and, I think she went to hell because every time I see her she looks like she just stepped out of a hot shower, and I... I'm never sure if it's her, or the Lady who tells me things! They fight over me all the time.  The Lady... I saw when I was ten. I was lying on the grass, looking at the sun, and the sun became a cloud, and the cloud became, a Lady. And she told me she would talk to me. And then... her feet began to bleed and I saw there... there were holes in her hands and in her side. And I tried to catch the blood as it fell from the sky, but I couldn't see any more because my eyes hurt because there were big black spots in front of them. And she tells me things like, like... right now she's crying Marie! Marie! ... but I don't know what that means.
... and... she uses me to sing, it's as if she's throwing a big hook through the air and it catches me under my ribs and tries to pull me up, and I... I can't move because Mommy's holding my feet and all I can do is sing in her voice... it's the Lady's voice, God loves you!
 God loves you.
Do you know a Marie?
No... do you?
Why should I?
I don't know.
Well... what do you think? Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
What's your opinion?
I believe Agnes is different.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.

 In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
She didn't! This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
So, someone else could have done it.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
And in your eyes?
I've already told you what I thought.
That she was unconscious, yes! So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?

I promise you Doctor, even if I had the inclination, how could I possibly catch her? She would have to be a very slow and patient nun.  Ah no... they're a very special and rare people those Sisters. Only a few of them left in this modern world, consecrated to the praise of God.

Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.

It's Martha, Mama. (hands over a tub of icecream) There you go.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
 Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.

Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.

Oh that one there, in the corner.

Yes.

This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
Shortly after she came to us.
And you weren't shocked?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
And what happened?
She stopped eating completely...
This was before her pregnancy?
About two years before.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
 He talked to you Himself?
No.
Through someone else?
Yes.
Who?
I can't say.
Why?
She'd punish me.
One of the other Sisters?
No.
Who?
Why would she tell you to do this?
 Because I'm getting fat.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
Agnes...
I'm a blimp.
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
Because...
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
He loves you the way you are.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Who told you this?
It's a sin to be fat.
Why?
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Agnes...
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Who tells you these things?
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
 That's not what he meant.
I...    I am a little child but my body keeps    getting bigger and soon I... I won't    be able to fit in, I... I won't be able    to squeeze into Heaven.
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
Oh my dear child.
 God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Who?
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
But she watches... she listens.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
I'm not hungry.
No I don't... the host is enough.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.

 Yes, of God.

Dear Jesus...
It started this morning and I can't get it to stop.
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand! She could have bled to death.
She has it now.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
Not simple, no.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
You bet I am.
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.

She lived here for almost seventy years. Every day she'd ring the bell, wake us up, call us to God. She took me to my secret place.

Sister Paul was in her eighties?   Did she climb up here often?
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
 No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.

 Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
 I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?

Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
You have trouble sleeping?
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
What things?
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
How did she know that?
Somebody told her.
Who?
I don't know.
Agnes...
You'll laugh.
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Did your mother see angels often?
No.
Do you?
No.
Do you believe she really saw them?
 No, but I can never tell her that.
Why not?  Mmm?
She'd get angry.
Agnes, did you love your mother?
Yes.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
I could never be a mother.
Why not?
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
Why not?
Because I don't want one.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
Like you?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
 A mistake...
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
A mistake... it was a mistake...
 If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
Not my fault.
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
I was a mistake.
What the child?
Everything... I don't have children.
Agnes...
Don't touch me like that! You don't touch me like that, I know what you want from me, you want to take God away. You should be ashamed, they should lock you up people like you.
You hate us don't you?
What?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.

I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
It's my affair too.
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
I'm only interested...

Only you think    you're lucky because you didn't have    a mother who said things to you and did    things to you that maybe weren't always    nice but that was because of me, because    I was bad, not her.

She tells you you're ugly?
Yes.
And that you're stupid?
Yes.
That you're a mistake?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Why?
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
How does she know that?

Oh, yes.

She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good, I won't be a baby any more.

Thank you.
You lied to me
 Your niece!
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
And Agnes' father?
It could have been any one of a dozen men from what my sister told me.
She was afraid that Agnes would follow in her footsteps. She did everything she could to prevent it.
Like keeping her home from school?
Yes.
Listening to angels?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Do you know what she did to her?
I don't think I care to know.
She molested her!
Oh, dear God.
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there? Lots of dirty little secrets.
 Oh God, if only I'd known.
Why didn't you? You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
I knew that after the fact.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Because I didn't know... 
Oh, God.
Larry...
Marty, what are you doing here?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
What? You think that the girl is innocent?
I don't know.
You got to be crazy.
prostitute.
Larry...
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
I'll ask around, see what I come up with. In the meantime you go home and get some sleep.
Thanks. 
 If I find anything I'll call you.
flicks the answerphone on. Her cat meows.
Hi Marty, it's Helen. Mrs Davenport
 Hallo, Doctor Livingston. My name is . I'm doing a Sunday article on Sister Agnes for the Gazette. I would appreciate it if you would give me a phone call on 942-2424.
Hi Marty, it's me. Listen I just talked with Detective Crawley who was at the convent. She said that there was one thing that bothered her that didn't make it into the report. The waste paper basket. The one in Agnes' room. (Martha freezes in the middle of lighting up) None of the other nuns had one. Bye.
... her that didn't make it into the report. The waste paper basket. The one in Agnes' room. None of the other nuns had one. Bye.
incences it and raises it up. Close on individual nuns at prayer including Agnes.
I've gotten the court's permission to hypnotise her.
And my permission?
I'd like yours too.
follows her.
We'll see about that.
Don't deny it!
I haven't decided yet.
The woman's health is at stake.
Her spiritual health.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
I know you don't.
Sentence her and be done with it, that's what you're saying and I...
An unhappy woman...
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
Why didn't you just throw the baby into the incinerator and be done with it.
Because I am a moral person.
Bullshit!
Bullshit yourself!
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
You just said...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Nothing...
What have we done to hurt you? And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do? Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh? You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
So instead of questioning that one rule...
 It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run
Stupid woman... and that's all?
That's all? That's enough!   She was a beautiful little girl.
And what has that to do with it?
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me? I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
Martha are sitting there talking. Martha is smoking.
When I was a child I used to hear my guardian angel. She sang to me 'till I was six years old. That's when I stopped listening. But I remember the voice. A few years ago I looked at myself and saw nothing but a nun who was certain of nothing. Not even of Heaven. Not even of God. And then one evening I saw Agnes standing by
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
No, it reminds me.
Would you like one? Huh?
I'd love one.
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
All right?
Fine thanks...
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
 Long, thin and filtered.
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course
Hand rolled.
Even Christ would partake socially.
Saint Peter?
Pipe!
Right...
Mary Magdelen?
 Oh, you've come a long way baby.
And Saint John would chew tobacco.
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Do you think they ever existed?
Yes I do.
Do you want to become one?
Become?     One is born a saint.
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth. 
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
Listen to her singing.
 I'd like to begin.
Begin what?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
Would it stop you if I did?
No.
May I be present?
Of course.
Then let's begin.
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
Yes.
Who am I?
Doctor Livingston.
And why am I here?
To help me.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Because I'm in trouble.
What kind of trouble?  What kind of trouble Agnes?
I'm frightened.
Of what?
Of telling you.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
 I had a baby.
How did you have a baby?
It came out of me.
Did you know what was going to come
Yes.
Did you want it to come out?
No.
Why?
Because I was afraid.
Why were you afraid?
Because I wasn't worthy.
To be a mother?
Yes.
Why?
May I open my eyes now?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
It grew.
What made it grow? Do you know?
Yes.
Would you like to tell me?
No.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
Will she be angry?
She made me promise not to.
Who?     Who made you promise?  It's    alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's    go to your room. It's the night about    six weeks ago when you were very    sick.
I'm afraid.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
I ate.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
I hate them.
And then what happened?
We went to chapel for vespers.
Hm hmm.
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
What is it?
Someone's following me.
Who?
Sister Marguerite I think.
Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby?  Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night.
Open your eyes.  What do you see?
My bed.
What else?
A crucifix.
Above the bed? Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different? What is it?
 A wastepaper basket.
Do you know who put it there?
No.
What do you think it's there for?
For me to get sick in.
Are you ill?
Yes.
What do you feel?
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
What do you do?
I have to throw up...
I can't... glass... one of the sisters has fed me glass.
Which one?
I don't know which one
Of what?
Of me. Oh... God! My God... (assumes the birth position and looks between her legs) Water... it's all water...
Why isn't anyone coming?
 They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
 Stop her!
What is it?
Who?
Go away, I don't want you here.
Is someone in the room with you?
No... don't hit me please...
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
 NO... no... I said leave her alone.

Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three... (claps her hands; Agnes comes to) It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?
Frightened.
Do you remember what just happened?
 Yes.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
There you go. It's alright, it's alright, it's all over. It's alright Agnes, that's right, that's right.
Ah excuse me. Hallo. I'm looking for some ah... ground plans for the ah... Saint Marie Madeleine Convent in .

Oh... very interesting I guess... (he pulls out a folder of plans) Excuse me...
They both look at the plans.
Ah viola! This has everything. Even the secret entrance. They all had that. Usually to get from building to building in the snow... (he indicates on the plan)
 That's how he got in... or she got out.
Oh excuse me, what did you say?
Nothing. May I take some notes?
Oh yes,

checks her lipstick in the reflective metal walls. The lift stops and the Sisters get off.
Is the Doctor in her office?
Ah, who shall I say is calling?
 General MacArthur.
Just a minute please, you can't go in there.
 It's... it's alright Helen, just close the door.
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
 You're what?
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
 One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
For the Church?
For Agnes.
You think she's a saint?
She's been touched by God, yes.
How? How? She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
The father!
Who is he?
Why must he be anybody?
 My God, you're as crazy as...
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
How  ?
Don't be ridiculous.
Well give me a reasonable explanation
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
This is insane.
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
You're saying God did it?
But how did it happen?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
But what    you are choosing to believe is a lie    because you won't face the fact that she    was raped... or seduced... or that    she did the seducing.
She is an innocent.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
That's what you believe she is?     The sum of her psychological parts?
That's what I have to believe...
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
 I'm not accusing. I'm recognizing.
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Somebody told her.
Who? That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Why would I lie?
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
I'm concerned about her health.
Who was that person Mother?    Was it you?
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
All I want is one more week.
Why? (continues in French, then...) You've done nothing to show any progress.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
I'll have a decision by next week.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
 You have proof?
I'll have it.
When?
Next week.
 No, no, no...
No!
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Yes, demain
Excuse me Mother, Doctor Livingston is here.
Martha hands    her a court order. Mother Miriam reads it briefly and hands it back.
This is permission to take her apart.
Where is she?
Hasn't she had enough?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
My God, but you're determined.
Who knew she was pregnant?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Was it you?
Is it because she's a nun?
Did you know she was pregnant?
Yes.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
I didn't guess until it was too late.
For what?     An abortion?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Too late for what?
I don't know... too late to stop it.
The baby?
The scandal...
You went to the room to help with the birth.
She didn't want any help.
That's a lie.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
And the baby.
No!
You tied the cord around its neck.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Before or after you killed the child?
I left it with her and I went for help.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Then she's a liar.
Agnes, can you hear me?
Yes.
I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.
What's the matter?
She said Michael.
What did she mean?
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
And the passage to the barn?
Yes.
Why?
So I could go to him.
Who?
Him.
How did she know about him?
She'd seen him too.
Where?
From the belltower the day she before she died.
So she sent you?
Yes.
What happened?
about as Agnes    moves nervously through the barn.
He's here.
Are you frightened?
Yes.
sounds as they fly around the barn.
Hallo...
... where are you?
Is it you?
I... I'm afraid... yes, yes I do... why me?... wait, I want to see you.
What do you see?
Halos...
on her back. Still all we can see are doves flashing in the light.
... dividing and dividing feathers and starts, falling, falling into the iris of God's eye. Oh... oh!... it's... it's so lovely... it's so... blue... yellow... blood wings, brown, blood...
to see two holes in her palms weeping blood.
His blood... my God...
Oh Agnes...
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
 Agnes... Agnes...
with blood.     Martha follows her.
Stay away from me...
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
No...
He    frightened you and he hurt you. It's not    your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who    he is so we can find him. Stop him    from doing this to other women.
Not your fault...
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
Of course you do. Who was it?
I hate him for what he did to me.
Yes.
For what he made me go through.
Who?
I hate him.
Agnes, who did this to you?
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
That's enough.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
 She can't remember.
What happened to the baby?
It was dead.
It was alive wasn't it?
I don't remember.
 Oh, don't do this!
Wasn't it!
YES!
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
She took the baby in her arms?
Yes.
You saw it all didn't you?
Yes.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
I thought I... I can save her.  I can give her back to God.
What did you do?
I put her to sleep.
H... how?
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
prays. Martha claps her hands lightly together once.
Sister   Marguerite and Mother Miriam. Justice Leveau is summing up.
In view of the situation as it now stands, and the testimony given here this morning, it seems quite clear that the defendant was in no manner responsible for her actions. It is therefore the judgement of this court that she be returned to the convent of Marie Madeleine where she will be cared for under proper medical supervision by a visiting physician.
to sum up in French when suddenly Agnes stands up.
 Oui. Do you have something to say?
 I stood in the window of my room every night for a week. And one night I heard the most beautiful voice imaginable. And when I looked I saw the moon shining down on him. For six nights he sang to me, songs I'd never heard. And on the seventh night he opened his wings and lay on top of me. All the while he sang -  Charlie Sweet... Charlie Sweet... Charlie's a...
Please, remove her from the court.
Would someone please remove the defendant from the courtroom.

I don't know the meaning behind the song she sang. Perhaps it was a song of seduction. And the father was a fieldhand. Perhaps the song was simply a lullaby that she remembered from many years ago. And the father was hope and... and love and desire. And a belief in miracles.
convent over    which Agnes' singing can be heard.
I want to believe that she was blessed. And I do miss her, and I hope that she's left something, some little part of herself with me. That would be miracle enough wouldn't it?
