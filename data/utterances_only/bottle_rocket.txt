What color hair does he have?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Right. The blond guy.
OK. That's wrong.
Dignan, it's --
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
Why?
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
 What does Starsky say?
He says. This is he.
This is he?
No. This is he.
Did you see what I meant about the window?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Would they do that?
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
Can I use your Tabasco?
Sure.
You don't see many women who like Tabasco.
She's really kind of hot.
 She's an attractive older woman.
Well, what do you think?
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
I'm not allowed to drive those.
Not even for emergencies?
 No.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
They are.
So who's going to know?
My brother.
Future Man.
Who?
Futute Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
That never would of --
Let's cut the bullshit.
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
What do you think the cops have?
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
What are you talking about, Bob?
Can you use a coaster.
Did you ever steal a car bdfore?
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T-Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
You stole a Trans-Am.
Yes. I did.
OK, Bob.
It's true, Dignan.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
 I'll just drive my car.
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
Your ball.
I told you not to take the earrings.
You got another ball.
I'm playing your game.
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
What?
Where are you going?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
How was I ridiculing you?
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
That's not what I meant, Dignan.
Did you see that?
Yeah, I saw it.
I'm lookout.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
That sets it off.
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
It had an alarm.
Yeah, I heard that.
 Five, seven, eight dollars.
 Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Eight dollars.
That's not bad.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Hector woudn't do anything.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Good question.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
You're paranoid, Bob.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
Could you grow cinnamon?
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
You could make your own cinnamon toast.
Are you a fag?
You're the faggot.
Little Richard. I don't believe it. They'll let anybody in this place. Sit down.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
 I don't know about that.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
The one and only Little Richard.
Are you named after THE Little Richard?
 Ha! Ha! Ha! Why don't you stick it up your ass. Great group of guys you're hanging out with.
What was that all about?
I can't believe you said that.
What did I say?
I told you he's crazy.
But he didn't say anything.
Hang on a second.
Little Richard. Wait a second. Hang on. I didn't mean to --
Let them fight.
Let them fight.
 Anthony.
OK. Break it up. Break it up.
I separated my shoulder.
OK. Hang on.
Just pull straight up. Anthony pulls up hard on Dignan's arm. Dignan tries not to yell, then suddenly he's OK and relieved.
Is it back in?
 Yeah.
OK, man. Let's go.
No. I'm not fighting anymore.
His shoulder went out, man. It's over.
You guys better get out of here.
Bob?
The guy is fucking insane.
I warned you, Dignan.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
Loop around real fast.
Just turn right here.
Where'd she go?
Maybe she turned.
There she is.
Bob, don't be so obvious.
I think we might of scared her.
Let's just go.
You blew it, Bob.
A gun is a firearm. A pistol is a firearm. But anything you hold in your hand is a weapon. A knife. A wrench. A ballpoint pen.
A ballpoiht pen?
Anyone who tells you a ballpoint pen is not a weapon needs intensive psychiatric treatment. You can stick them in the esophagus. You give them a ballpoint tracheotomy.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
You think we're going to be chased?
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
 I'm going to take a look at this.
 Hang on This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
 That's my responsibility.
That's your domain.
OK.
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
 Nothing. Go ahead.
 How many bullets can that hold?
Bob.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
 What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
 No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
 I paid for it.
God DAMMIT.
You two just don't give a shit, do you?
Dignan, calm down.
 You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Dignan! Stop!
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
 You're right. You're right.
What are you guys doing?
Nothing. We're just --
You seen my brother?
He's inside.
 Hi.
Goddammit, Bob! Get your shit together.
What are you guys up to tonight?
Nothing much.
Just hanging around.
Bye.
What'd Future Man want?
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
The only nut with a gun is going to be Dignan.
 You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
He electrocuted someone?
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
His name was Swifty?
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
That's too bad.
 You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
What are you doing?
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
 Let's get lucky.
I left my sweater inside.
Do you have a lost and found?
We're closed.
I left my sweater in there.
Oh. I see. Come on in.
We're closed, sir.
Where's that guy going?
He left his sweater.
Well, I left some money in there.
Where?
 In the cash relister. Step away from the door.
Where's the manager?
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
We know there's another stocker.
Rob?
Where is he? Where is Rob?
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
You got that?
Sure. Literature. The classics.
Is that the manager?
 Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Rob?
 Uh-huh?
Why aren't you in literature?
 It's all full up.
Open it up.
OK. Open the other. Let's go.
Put it in one of those.
A bigger one, you idiot.
 Don't call me an idiot, you punk.
I'm sorry. But that bag's too small.
OK, guys. Just...Sit tight.
Go. Go. Drive slow.
What happened?
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
This is natural.
 That's good. Keep it at forty.
Did we get it?
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
Holy shit.
We got it. We got it.
How much is there?
Don't count it.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
No. I was calm.
What about what that guy said?
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
Are you serious?
Yeah. He said that.
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Like he meant it.
Yeah.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
You really think he'll remember you?
 No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
See you.
See you, Bob.
Hang on, Bob.
That was really good driving. Seriously. I mean it.
We'll see you later, Bob. Good driving.
What's wrong with him?
What do you think?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Don't even say it, man.
Bob, will you please listen?
I don't want to talk about it.
Look, I admit I was wrong for not telling you before the robbery that your share wouldn't be as equal as ours. But the fact remains me and Anthony were much more exposed to danger.
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
 That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
What was that?
What?
Motherfucker!
What's going on?
Phil. What happened?
 Motherfucker. I'll kill him.
 Who?
I've called the police. Oh, my God, Phil.
Don't touch me! I swear to God I'll get that guy.
I know you will, Phil. There was nothing you could do. All you had was a golf club.
You're bleeding, man. Sit down.
What happened?
Some black man beat Phil up.
He didn't beat me up. He attacked me.
He took two hundred dollars.
 Tilt your head back.
He was probably on drugs.
They usually are.
As soon as I opened the door I saw him. A black guy. Looking through my dad's tool box. I wanted to trap this guy. So I closed the garage door.
And that's when he hit you?
 He struck me. I fell down. He took my wallet. Then he opened the garage door and ran away.
How'd the window break?
I hit it with the golf club.
How long do you have to go?
26 weeks.
And what does that cover?
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Hand to hand combat?
Ground defense.
Did you hear that?
What?
Shhh.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
There's a million places to hide around here.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I hope not.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
No, it was a rustling sound.
The dog. Look out for the dog.
Is this dog going to bite?
No. Shit no.
See? I don't know what he's talking about.
Where you going?
Move.
What's wrong?
He probably went into the next yard. Shine the light over here.
Those are...
Halt! Sir!
Bill! He's running!
The prowler! That way!
Way to go, Bob!
I told you they were there.
 So it's my fault?
Be quiet.
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
There were more than that.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
Nobody does.
Obviously. That's why we go on the road. The thing about cops is they have short attention spans.
Can I get that credit card from you?
 I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Why not?
Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
 Well, then cut it in half.
I keep it for emergencies.
Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
Here's mine right here. See?
See if mine are in there.
 Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
Look at the treads on those.
What about them?
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
OK, Dad.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
You were spoiled rotten.
Enough. Jesus Christ.
 You want to say it, Bob?
I'll just say it.
I'll say it.
OK. Go ahead.
On your marks... (waits a second, says very fast:) Get set go.
 You owe me fifty bucks.
Bob?
Anthony won.
Bob wasn't even looking.
Was that shirt made from a towel?
What?
 It's just terrycloth, isn't it?
Yeah. I think so.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Right.. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
True.
What the fuck is this?
Ram him, Bob.
Hit him!
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
He wouldn't move.
Is he chasing us?
I don't know.
Speed up, Bob.
You think he got my license plates?
He looked too shaken-up.
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
It's registered in my mother's name.
 What the fuck possessed you?
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
I meant tap him. As a warning.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
Well, Bob, Samson has decided that his hair is more important than our safety.  My friend, that is a reckless decision! Let's go, Bob.
Bob. Are you coming?
See you in a little while.
See you, Bob.
No, it's OK. Come on in.
It's hot out, isn't it? Yeah. This is a nice little town. So, what, do you do all these rooms yourself? Or what? I'm Anthony.
What's your name?
Inez.
Inez?
Let me give you a hand with that.
How do you say nineteen?
Dies y nueve.
Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
 No.
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
People think because they're in a hotel they can act like a slob. It's bad manners.
Were you born in Mexico?
Cuba.
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
Scuse me.
These towels are still warm.
I guess from the dryer.
I've never met anybody from Cuba before.
Housekeeping.
We're just checking out.
Hi.
Hi.
You can go first, Bob.
My brother's in jail.
What are you talking about?
The weed.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
They said he's a drug dealer.
Those assholes. We got rapes. Murders. Violent crimes every second. And this is what they come up with.  They're just fucking him because he's from a prominent family.
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
That could be anybody's.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage. DIGNAN Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
 I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
How long has he been in there?
I don't know.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
We'll have to see when we get back.
What do you mean get back?
 Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
This could be a trap. BOB Come on, Dignan.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
I'm going back.
 Not in that car you're not.
Watch me.
Good luck, since I got the keys.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
I can't do that, Bob.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
Look, Bob. I understand your loyalty. You're a good person. But right now you're not using your best judgement.
Future Man would not want you to go to jail I promise you. Just get in the car and we'll talk about it.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
I know it's not.
You don't even know his name.
Yes, I do.
What is it?
Just get in the car, Bob.
What's his name?
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
You're going to ride in the back?
Come on, Bob. Get in front.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
Let's go.
Hi. How's it going.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
No. We didn't.
We're making banana daqueris.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
May I have a word with you, please?
Sure.
What the fuck is going on here?
What. What's the matter?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
They don't?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
Which one was that?
On the left.
She's from Cuba.
No kidding.
Dignan.
 Anthony. Bad news.
How long are they going to hold him?
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
He needs to hire an attorney.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
Anthony, I --
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
As long as he gets out OK.
Obviously. That's a given.
Bob?
What?
Is that OK?
 Yeah. I guess so.
See, now we've got a plan.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
 God, yes. Like silk. Inez starts to giggle.
What?  What?
Like silk?
God. That does sound corny.  Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
No lifeguard on duty. Swim at your own risk.
You know, I did save Anthony from drowning once, Inez. Tell her, Anthony.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
This was in fourth grade.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
 Yes...It's true.
Son of a bitch.
He's gone. He stole the car.
Where was it parked?
Right here.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
Maybe he just went to the store.
He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.
He went back for his brother.
We said 48 hours.
That's a long time to be in jail.
We'll get him. Don't worry about that. We'll go back. We'll find him. And we'll blow up his car. Or do something. I promise you.
I mean, let's face it. Bob was dead weight. We're a lot better off without him.  But who could expect it? Just like that. Steals the fucking car. What kind of person pulls that --
Bob didn't steal the car. He told me he was going. He had to go help his brother.
When'd he tell you?
This morning.
Where was I?
You were asleep.
He told you and you let him do it.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
 If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real suprised, that was just an act. You were just --
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
If you say so.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
You want to look at the map?
See. Here's where we are.
I didn't know he had it in him.  I guess you could say the child has become the father of the man.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
Why don't you come with us.
OK.
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
No. I just have short hair.
Is that your chiquita?
No, my friend knows her.
She Chicano, yes?
You like Chicanos?
Sure.
Play pool? For one cerveza.
 You a good pool player.
Got a little lucky.
Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
I don't know.
She is a good looking woman.
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
What?
Fight. You know.
No. Just pool.
You Hoto?
 Fuck you. You a Hoto.
 No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
Right.
Pinche cabrone. Puta madre.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
Can you hand me those french fries.
I wish I'd been there.
Would of been nice.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
 We need a car.
I have an idea for that.
What?
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
I don't think we can do that.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
She doesn't need to know.
 I don't know, Dignan. I just -- DIGNAN Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
Shh.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
Then you better think of something.
How are you, Jerry?
 I feel great, Inez.
 I'll see you later.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
You don't know how to hotwire.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
What'd you say to Inez?
"I'll come back for you. I love you, Inez."
"I'm going to take you away from all this windexing and making beds."
Man, I don't know anything about cars.
You really know how to pick them.
I think we better go home.
Don't panic, Anthony.
I'm not. But there's --
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
Our money situation is not good.
 You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
We've got sixteen dollars.
That's not correct.
Give it to me.
Sixteen dollars.
I know.
Where's the rest?
I had to give some to Inez.
How much?
$383.
What!
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
She needed it.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
That's what she is!
I know that. But --
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Shut up!
What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
Stop!  Now listen to me.
Bob, where you going?
I'm not playing any more golf.
Why not?
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
You think I'm improving?
 Yes. You just got to stick with it.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
No, I don't mind.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.
I wanted to create an event. Something everyone would remember. And at first it worked perfectly. The whole school was standing around outside. Kids running all over the place. Everybody laughing.
Even the school custodian Swifty thought it was great. He kept laughing and shaking his head the whole time he tried to disconnect the generator. And then suddenly  total silence except for Swifty hanging off the generator with his leg stuck to it being electrocuted.
Actually he died of a heart attack brought on by the shock. He was an older guy.
I felt terrible. I'd known Swifty since first grade. He was Dignan's medicine man for Indian Guides. They called each other Rattlesnake and Killer Whale. Whenever Dignan came to visit me he would act like he and Swifty weren't that good of friends, but that was just to make me feel better. The whole rest of the school had turned against me.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Sixty days?
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
 It's a panther.
How's that 700 bucks coming?
I'm working on it.
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
 Were you adopted, Bob?
Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
No. I wasn't adopted.
Was Future Man adopted?
Jesus Christ! No.
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Is that Buckethead?
Get down.
Is that him?
Wait a second.
That's Anthony.
That's your friend Anthony?
Yeah.
What's he doing here?
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
Don't get too close.
Stop. He saw us.
Wait. Did he see us?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
Speed up.
Anthony!
Wait up.
Where you going?
Just walking Hector.
When'd you get back?
Ah. Couple days ago.
 You want to shake hands.
Who's in the car?
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
Sure.
This is Applejack.
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
You're Anthony?
Yeah.
I hear you're a good thief.
I'm just sitting at this bar drinking my drink when this fine chick walks by. She was a living doll. And the big motherfucker who came in with her sees me looking, when he walks by he steps on my foot. Doesn't say shit. Just takes a seat with his lady. Well, I holler out to him, If I was as big as you, ain't no way in the hell you'd of stepped on my foot like that. He just laughed. He says, Little man, take your foot and put it in your pocket. I said, No, how about I take my foot and I stick it up your ass? Man, we went to war right there. I hit him so hard I knocked his nuts in his watchpocket. But this motherfucker wouldn't go down. Then all the sudden, out of nowhere, Dignan came up behind him and smashed a bottle on his head. And that big old boy went down. That's how I met Dignan. Good cat to have on your side. He'll go to war with you. He don't give a fuck.
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker war.
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
Pretty much. He kind of fell into me. But wait a second.
I want you to look at this.
What is it?
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
Who's Mr. Henry?
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
 Uh-uh.
S. Cooper Trust,in San Francisco?
Uh-uh.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac. ANTHONY What exactly is this place? Freezers?
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
Abdul-Shabazz?
Just a nickname.
What time did he say to be here?
Right now.
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
What do you mean?
Feel this.
 You could give somebody a concussion.
Let me feel that.
 Ow. Shit.
How's the weather down there?
 Mr. Henry?
Come on in!
It's locked.
No, it's not.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
This is no good.
This is no good, bringing him here. What are you thinking? What the shit, man? Are you crazy?
I'm pulling your leg. Abe Henry.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
Thanks.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
Thanks.
Nice shot.
Is he in?
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
Yeah, I'm in.
OK, kid. Let's go talk about cops and robbers.
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success? The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
Grammar.
What do you mean grammar?
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
You mean like techniques?
 Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
 Yes, I do.
On the other hand you got to have the right equipment. I don't care if you're Harry Houdini. You can't pick a lock without a hairpin.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
The grammar?
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Oh, yeah.
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
You mean a safecracker?
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
Is he good?
He's damn good.
So what do you think of the plan, Mr. Kumar?
We'd love to have you on the team.
What is that? An orchid?
Good plan.
What do you think?
 He seems pretty good.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Not bad.
Come on in. What you been up to?
Not a whole lot, Bob.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
Yeah. It is.
Let's not even talk about it.
It was stupid.
Right. It was extremely stupid.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Man, I don't want to go into this.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
You said 48 hours!
I never agreed to that.
Bob, you're lying!
Bullshit.
All right! Backyard! Right now!
Let's go, Bob!
Dignan. Take it easy.
Bob!
No, Dignan. This is stupid.
Yeah. Dignan. Look. Let's just --
Stop, Dignan!
He doesn't want to fight.
Get out of the way.
No, Diqnan. This isn't --
Come on!
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
Dignan, we're friends. Take it easy.
Dignan. Dignan.
All right. Stop.
No fighting.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother. BOB I didn't have any choice.
I'm sorry, Bob.
That's OK.
 Shit, Dignan.
 What the fuck are we doing out here?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
I'm sorry, Bob.
That's OK.
Look. We want you on the job.
Let me get this straight. You don't play golf and you don't play tennis. So why do you belong to a country club?
You got me.
 You're a piece of work, Bob.
How you doing, Bob?
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
You keeping out of trouble?
I'm trying.
 This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
He said what?
He said you ran away from home.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
Bob.
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
Hi, Bob.
 So what's shaking?
Nothing much.
How's it going.
Fine, thanks.
John Mapplethorpe. (shaking hands with crew across table) How are you. Hi.
Good to know you, John.
Jackson says you told him I ran away from home.
I might have mentioned it.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.
The world needs dreamers, son.
What?
The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
 Nice to meet you.
I hope this doesn't offend you, Bob.  Your brother is a cocksucker.
No. That doesn't offend me.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
Eleven fifteen.
OK. Mark that down.
I did.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
It's like we've finally arrived.
What are you writing?
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
So do I.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here. ANTHONY  I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
You're wrong about Dignan.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
Hold it.
Anthony. I want.to say one thing to you.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
What do you mean?
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
That was a test?
Take a deep breath.
How does that feel?
It feels good.
Did Dignan take the test?
 Yes, he did.
How'd he do?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
That sounds like Dignan.
Woah. There he is. Applejack! What it is.
Is my car OK out there?
I love it. He always wants to know if the car's OK. Get a hot dog.
I don't eat pork.
Super K. Kumar. Come here.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
True.
What the fuck are you doing?
What was that all about?
Ramedan.
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
Me?
No, that door over there.
I don't want to die.
Are you afraid?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Exactly. Woah.
Death.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
No. Bob did.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
 Anthony, I'm petrified.
Is that sugarless gum you're chewing?
I'm not chewing gum.
Would you like a piece?
 Sure. Thanks.
If someone could copy my life story. If I had someone, man, to just write what I talk. I have so many stories. Bestseller, man.
I've been all over the Goddamn country. I've seen things.
I used to go to Vegas and do headstands.
No kidding.
Easy.
Come on, Bob.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Jesus Christ.
Give him a second. BOB Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
Good.
Join the party, fellas.
We're just going over a few things.
I'll tell you something, Dignan. It is possible to overplan. You don't want to turn the crew into robots. Right?
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Yes.
 Why?
Well, I think --
No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
This is good.
I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
Well, that's just it, Anthony. A lot of criminals have problems. Some of them are alcoholics. Some have drug problems. Others dome from broken homes. I see a real need for healing.
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
Yeah.
It's an esoteric journey.
We're renegades from despair.
 Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Absolutely.
Why'd you want to help us?
 Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
Next week we'll be drinking pia coladas.
 Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
Did that hurt?
This'll be a good trip.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
I don't think you will.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
 I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
He was a nice guy.
 He was all right.
Do you like Inez?
As a person?
Yeah. As a girl.
Yes. I do.
So do I.
You OK, Bob?
 No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
 Nothing. I was just asking.
Jesus, Bob.
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
 Sure.
I'll take one of those, too, please.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
You're all clear.
Roger.
 We all set?
Hang on a second.
 OK. Let's do it.
Let's get lucky, Bird Dog.
Scarecrow?
Yeah?
Everything OK?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
Uh-huh?
Take your second position.
OK. Roger.
OK. Six minutes.
Where did he go?
Who? Applejack?
Why did he go that way? 
He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.
 Bird dog? You in position?
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Any activity?
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Good. It's supposed to be.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Stand by, Bird Dog.
Jacknife. Come in, Jacknife.  Hello? Bob? Are you there?
 Bob? What the fuck is going on? Anthony? Who's in the elevator?
I don't know.
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
What are you doing?
My walkie talkie's busted. 1 can't tell what's going on.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
No.
What's happening? What's going on?
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
I couldn't hear anything.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
It's going back down.
 Applejack! What's happening?
What?
Bob! Get back in position!
Don't move! Get up against the wall!
 They're back! Get down here!  What are you doing here?
Time!
 Two minutes.
Where'd they come from?
The front stairs.
 Where were you?
My walkie talkie broke.
What's the story?
Can't get it. It won't... 
What can we do?
OK. Fuck it.
Let's go. Fuck it.
Freeze!
Nobody move!
Get against the wall!
Jesus, Bob.
I didn't do anything.
Applejack? Are you OK?
 What's wrong with Applejack?
He's having a heart attack or something.
 Let's go!
Help me move him.
Careful. Check his pulse.
Is he breathing?
I think so.
Jesus Christ.  What the fuck is that?
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Take him to the car, Bob.
Who tripped the alarm?
It's the fire alarm.  Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Where's Kumar?
 I don't know.
Jesus Christ, Anthony.  Did you lose him?
What?
What for?
What are you doing?
Let's go. Come on.
What were you doing in there?
Wait for Kumar.
Come on, Kumar.
The elevator broke.
Where's Applejack?
He's stuck between two floors.
You're kidding.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
Yeah.
Who's got the car keys?
Applejack drove.
 Run. Run. Let's go.
Jesus, Dignan.
What the fuck happened to the the plan?
Come on.
I'll see you there.
What?
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
Dignan, it's too late.
I don't think so.
You know, Rowboat. People who smoke cigarettes die. People who smoke cigars just keep on going.
Sit.
Freeze!
Drop the fucking gun!
Don't move!
You're caught, buddy.
Put your hands behind your back.
I'm not going to do anything.
 Why'd you try to run, buddy? Don't you know what freeze means? Don't you speak fucking English?
Take it easy.
 Calm down.
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
What's that?
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
Like amnesia.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
Oh.
Tell Mr. Henry I said that.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
 I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
He did?
Yeah.
You got to be kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
 What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.
The grandfather clock?
He got everything.
Wow.  Sorry, Bob.
You think Applejack knew?
 We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
Why?
We're not sure.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
No. That's true.
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
What do you mean?
Nothing.
You're living on a sailboat?
 It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it? ANTHONY Oh, I'd say about --
It's in the driveway.
 Temporarily.
Where?
Behind Bob's house.
Does it float?
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
So how is it in there? 
 What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
Do you have your own room?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own cell?
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
What's he in for?
He stole a tractor.
Do they let you --
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
 This sure beats the shit out of the shit they crap out in this joint.
 I might have to have another one of these.
Thanks for coming.
Hey.
I think I may have found a way out of here.
 You're kidding.
No. I'm not.
How?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Dignan, I --
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
What?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Dignan, I --
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
Scale the --
Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
Hold on --
Here we go.
Wait a second --
Now!
So long.
