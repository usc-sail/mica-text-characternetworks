Why'd they do that? I wasn't done.
I don't understand. Juice, why'd you gong this nice man?
We'll be right back with more stuff.
 Fuck. Shit. Piss.
 More stuff?
Yes sir, Mr. Barris. Everything you requested. Except I couldn't find a...  ... DH-10 directional fragmentation mine.
Well, it's late.  But thank you. Thank you for trying. You are a scholar and a...
Keep it. It's okay. Keep it.    You are a scholar and a...
 Thank you, sir.
Why are you not looking at me like that? Do I look ugly to you?  It's the not sleeping. I'm not sleeping, see. I have a lot on my...
 Um, another Gong Show rerun, sir?
 You know what I'd do? -- And don't tell anybody -- I'd rub... I'd rub Alpo brand dog food on my dick so the dogs would stick their noses into my... dick. Guaranteed big laugh, right? That was my trick, my great contribution to the world. How wouldn't I degrade myself, I ask you.
 I ask you! BELLHOP I... I... I don't know, sir.
Mr. Barris, maybe if you just don't watch the show every night, you wouldn't have to --
I always pay for the damn tv's, don't I?  Don't I?!
It's -- Yes, you do, sir, and we appreciate that -- It's just that there've been complaints from some of the other guests, and Mr. Andrews, the assistant manager, requested that I --
Still? Complaints? I specifically used the silencer this time! Specifically!
Well, the people in 917 found a bullet lodged in their wall. And while we want to accommodate you -- we certainly value your patronage -- there is an issue of customer safety.
Yes, of course.
My apologies. Buy -- 917, is it? -- buy them a magnum of your finest champagne. And... and your finest spackle. Oh, and get me a bag of plastic army men while you're out. I forgot to tell you before.
Thank you for your understanding, sir.
 And some black socks!   Seven black socks, you rascule!
Bellhop Johnson was clearly repulsed by the sight of me. And why not? I'm wrinkled... (searches for simile, then proudly) ... like a prune. Covered in liver spots...  ... like an old guy. My hair is falling out in clumps, leaving exposed patches of white, sickly scalp. A flabby inner-tube of fat hangs from my waist, practically obscuring my bedraggled prick -- dark and shriveled and dead. Still leaking urine even though I left the toilet ages ago. My asshole itches. Hemorrhoids abound. George Orwell said every man has the face he deserves by fifty. Does every man have the asshole he deserves by fifty, as well? Does every fifty year old asshole have the asshole he deserves?
It was 1981. I had holed myself up in this New York hotel. Parker Hotel. Terrified of everything. Ashamed of my life.
Ashamed?   What do you mean?
When you're young, your potential is infinite. You might do anything, really. You might be great. You might be Einstein. You might be Goethe. Then you get to an age where what you might be gives way to what you have been. You weren't Einstein. You weren't anything. That's a bad moment. But I remembered something Carlyle wrote: "... there is no life of a man, faithfully recorded, but is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or unrhymed." I realized my salvation might be in recording my wasted life, unflinchingly. Maybe it would serve as a cautionary tale. Maybe it would help me understand why.
My name is Charles Prescott Barris. I have written pop songs, I have been a television producer. I am responsible for polluting the airwaves with mind- numbing, puerile entertainment. In addition, I have murdered thirty-three human beings. I am damned to hell.
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1931, my early childhood remains accessible to me only as a series of elliptical, enigmatic memories.
The taste of bologna fresh from the butcher.
The sickly sweet smell of a burning babydoll on a crisp autumn day.
Velvet brushing against my tender young skin, as my mother dressed me.
A constant, inarticulate rage leading to fist fight after fist fight.
The calm I felt watching dust suspended in the early morning sunlight.
I remember fear.
Love.
You like the way mommy looks, Chuckie?
Yes.
I bet you would like to be a mommy some day, wouldn't you?
Yes, mommy. Please.
C'mere, you.
Rejection.
Expulsion.
When I was sixteen I had an experience with my little sister's friend Tuvia that left an indelible impression.
Phoebe's no Walter Page, huh, Tuvia?
I don't know who that is.
Of course you don't.  Why are you waiting around anyway, listening to this cacophonous cacophony, when you could be in your own abode disrupting the lives of your own siblings?
I don't know what anything you say means.
No.    You wouldn't, would you.
Hey.
 What?
Hey, Tuvia.
 Wha-at?!
You wanna lick it?
No.    Why should I?
Well, for one thing it tastes like strawberry. My sister tells me you love strawberries.
Yeah, well... I hate strawberries.
Honestly, a man's penis tastes exactly like a strawberry lollipop.
Look, I know that's not true, so --
It is true. It's weird but it's true.    I just read a research paper on it.
 My first love.
Uchh. Yech. It doesn't taste anything like strawberry, you creep.
 Well, what does it taste like?
Y'know, I'm gonna tell your mother what you just did.
If you do, I'll tell your mother you made our dog lick your crack.
I did not!
 So what?
Perhaps my whole life turned at that point. The repulsiveness of my sex confirmed by the tastebuds of a ripening pubescent girl.
And so I found myself in a downward spiral of debauchery. Endlessly chasing pussy. My only focus in life: to get laid, to get blown, trying to fool myself into believing that given the right combination of circumstances and deception, maybe the Tuvias of the world could desire me the way I desired them. I only wanted to be loved.
A constant, inarticulate rage led to bar fight after bar fight.
As much as I tried, I couldn't understand my past and my present was miserable, so, at twenty-four, I decided what I needed was a future...
... I had heard that television was an industry with a future.
Next, we'll have a look at the studio where they produce the Today Show.
That fella Raymond in payroll is kinda cute, huh?
Cute's all well and good, Mary Ann, but what you want is a man who's goin' places. A go-getter on the management fast-track.
Management trainee application, please.
How many people applying for this so far?
 Let's see, including you... about two thousand.
For how many positions?
 Five.
Tell me again.
Head of network sales at thirty.   Head of the entire network at forty.
And?
 Dead of a heart attack by fifty with all my millions left to you.
You're wonderful. I love you, Mr. Chuck Barris, management trainee.
Life was sweet. For a minute.
Baby doll!
I got fired.
Fired?
Fired.   F-I-R...
Fired?   What the fuck did you get fired for?!
I don't know, efficiency cutback. Some bullshit... Look, it's gonna be...
Well, I'm pregnant, you fuck!
Pregnant?
Yeah, pregnant!
What the fuck did you get pregnant for?!
What do you mean, what the fuck did I get pregnant for? You got me fucking pregnant, you fuck!
Well, fuck you.
So I figured I'd skip town. I intend to be important, y'know, I can't be saddled with this.. But then I remembered something Carlyle said: "Do the duty which lies nearest thee."
Who's Carlyle?
Dear God, why do I even bother?
Hey, fuck you, you condescending prick.
Hey, fuck you.
Hey, fuck you.
Hey, fuck you.
 Looks like I was just late.
I woke up and he was gone. No note. No nothing. I never saw him again. Until that stupid tv show he did.
The Gong Show.
I know what it's called, jerk.
In '61 I was thirty. I had become a minor suit at ABC. It was during the music payola scandal...
...so my job was to commute to Philly every day to the American Bandstand tapings, and keep an eye on Dick Clark.
Chuck Barris? He spooked me. I tried to keep on his good side becuase he was sort of... spooky.
How so?
I dunno, there was something in his eyes. Something dark, like unbridled ambition, maybe. Or an inarticulate rage.
On weekends I used to hang around amusement parks. Because that's where the young girls were.
I wrote a song about my experience.
Last night I took a walk after dark/to see a place called Palisades Park/to have some fun and see what I could see/that's where the girls are
I got it to Freddie "Boom Boom" Cannon through my friendship with Dick Clark. Dick really wanted to help me out.
I took a ride on the shoop de shoop/that girl I sat beside was awful cute/and when we stopped she was holding hands with me/my heart was flying/up like a rocket ship/down like a roller coaster/fast like a loop de loop/round like a merry go 'round...
Hi.
What?
Hi!
Oh.
I wrote this song.
Oh.    Uh-huh.
It's number three on the pop charts.
Huh.
See, I believe there's a great future in television.
Uh-huh.
So I'm going to take my royalties and create a pilot. A pilot is what they call a test tv show.
I work in tv.
Yeah. It's gonna be a game show. I believe there's a great future in game shows.
That's good.
Everyone loves game shows, right?
I don't know.
Well, they do.
That's great then.
I'm on my way!
Hello.
Hi.   Don't be alarmed    I'm with Debbie.
Yeah, I figured.
You hungry?
Um, no thanks.
Thirsty?
If you have a beer.
So how was sex with Debbie?   I've always wondered.
 It was good. Fine. Thanks for asking.
No problem. I just got fucked by this drummer cat. A really righteous Negro hipster.
Huh.   Interesting.
See, I believe in the brotherhood of man. Last week I got fucked by an Oriental.  What are you?
Jew.
That's what I thought. I had a Jew, but he was Sephardic. You look Ashkenazi , I'm guessing.
Ashkenazi.
Right. Ashkenazi... I haven't balled one of them.
You're a romantic.
Eh, I just don't get into all the bullshit between cats and chicks.
I know what you mean.
 You know what I mean?
I know what you mean.
Besides, you fall in love with a cat, you only get hurt. Right?
Don't I know it.
 We could ball if you want.     I seem to like you pretty well.
Well, that would be good. But, you know, I'm kind of here with Debbie. It doesn't seem right.
Yeah. That's true. I didn't think of that.  Well, I'm going to bed. Nice meeting you.
What's your name?
Penny.
I'm Chuck.
Oh, you're the one who wrote that Palisades song. I love that song.     It's such sentimental bullshit.
 ... so this ape and I were looking at each other. It was, like, across time and evolution. Then he began to talk, but it was a language I didn't understand, maybe Swiss. Then he turned into Perry Como, real square and... what's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Just because we fucked, doesn't mean there are strings now. It's okay.
Okay.
Okay? I only wanted to tell you my dream is all. Nothing more complicated than that. Don't panic.
I'm just used to all this dating bullshit, y'know. Now we're a couple. Now I'm obliged to give a shit what you say.
Don't worry about it, I'm not into those games either. So, anyway, this monkey turns into Perry Como and I say --
Holy fuck!
What?
Holy holy fuck!  You just gave me an idea. (starts pacing For a show! Fuck!
A show about monkeys?
In a way. About the craziest monkey of all: Monkius Humanius! Don't you see? About people! About sex. About romance. About the bullshit of dating!
I call it The Dating Game, Mr. Goldberg. And that's what it's about. A pretty girl asks three handsome guys, who she can't see, silly questions. And based on their answers, she picks one to date. And we pay for the date. That's it! That's the show! It's got everything!
No?
 They bought it!
They bought it they bought it they bought it...
They're giving me seventy-five hundred fucking dollars to make a pilot!
Oh my God!     Oh my God! We gotta go celebrate!     Let's go roller skating!
I can't, Pen. I got a date.
Okay.     That's cool.    Call me after.
Yeha, okay. I will.
I figured I was in. All I had to do was get the pilot made and I'd be a millionaire. Everyone would love me.
 Was anyone ever so young?
Chuck...
Albert's dead.
Well, he led an amazingly long life.
Still, it's hard to go on.
Y'know, you've been staring out this window for six months now.
I'm trying to come up with new tv shows, if you must know. Okay? That's what I'm doing. I believe there's a real future in tv.  Look. Ideas. Okay?
You're thirty-two years old, and you have no career and no prospects.
Thanks for the status report, Phoebe. Look, I just gotta come up with the right concept. Then, boom.  Which, by the way, I've almost got.
You're breaking mom's heart.     You know that, don't you?
Somehow, and don't ask me why, Phoebe, my being born broke mom's heart.
Hey Phoebe, you ever see what's-her-name, Tuvia, anymore?
Who?
Tuvia.   Your friend.   Tuvia.   The girl.
Oh. No. I heard something. I think she got divorced recently or something.
Oh, yeah?
Yes?  Well, if it isn't Strawberry-dick Barris.
Hi, Tuvia.
What do you want?
I came by to apologize.
Okay then.
Well, if it isn't Strawberry-dick Barris. Now what do you want?
So I'm back in town. For a while.      I thought maybe you and I could --
Jesus, you've got to be kidding.
You're a pretty angry young fella, aren't you? Can't fight worth a damn though.
Screw off, fag. Don't think I haven't seen you watching me in that bar for a week now.
Kind of a loner, I'd say. Fairly bright. A tad anti-social. Mad at the world. Can I buy you lunch?
Look, there's a schoolyard half a block down. Why don't you go trolling there?
I could teach you at least thirty different ways to kill a man with a single blow, Mr. Barris.
Might help you in future bar fights. Just a thought.
Oh, and there's money in it.    Good money.
 ... and I figure if I can keep afloat until I come up with my next game show idea, then all will be copacetic.
That sounds great, Chuck. Y'know, I've never known a television producer before. I'm impressed.
Yeah, yeah. So what's this money deal you were talking about?
Well, I work for a government agency, and I can always use good, enthusiastic men to help me carry out my directives.
What kind of work?   What government agency?
 Problem solving work.   For the Office of Diplomatic Security.
Office of what? Never heard of it.     Is that the fucking CIA or something?
Please be discreet, Mr. Barris.
 Jesus, it is the fucking CIA! Hell, I'll be a spy! Where do I sign up? Are you fucking with me? You're fucking with me, aren't you?
Hardly. And you wouldn't be with the company. You'd be a contract agent. Independent. No official tie to any agency. Is that understood?
 Why me?
As you know, I've been watching you. For years, actually. I've only let you know about it for the last week.
Jesus.
I'm happy to report you fit our profile, Mr. Barris. Are you interested in this work?
Well, what's the profile?
Are you interested in this work, Mr. Barris?
Yeah, sure, I wanna be a secret agent. Contract agent. Whatever. Get to fuck beautiful Eastern European women. Wear a trenchcoat. Sounds like a kick.
The work we do is very serious. It's essential in quelling the rise of communism and allowing democracy to gain its rightful foothold around the globe.
Sure.    Yeah. Okay.   That's good.
There are several efficient methods of killing a man, were you to find yourself without a weapon. The edge of your hand against the adversary's Adam's apple.  This will crush the windpipe causing strangulation and death.
Boxing your adversary's ears with proper force will cause his ear drums to burst and possibly result in bleeding in the brain. And death.
You're training me to be a killer.
See, Chuck, I knew you were fairly bright.
I can't kill people.    My future is in television.
Listen, you're thirty-two years old and you've achieved nothing. Jesus Christ was dead and alive again by thirty-three. Better get cracking.
I have ideas for shows.
Oh, good. Why don't you spend another six months developing 'em while staring out the window at mommy's house next to poor dead Albert the dog.
How do you know all that?
I know everything about you, Chuck. For fuck's sake, I know which hand you jerk off with.
Right. Leave in the morning, if you want. But I'm here to tell you this is honest work for good pay. You'd be helping to make the world safer. And your country would be grateful.
It'll toughen you up.
Glycerin is, of course, the best-known nitrating agent. Now keep in mind, nitroglycerin is extremely unstable. A slight tap, a one degree change in temperature and it'll blow up in your hands. Yee-haa, let's mix us up a batch!
Everybody take your 75 ml beaker and fill it to the 13 ml level with fuming red nitric acid, 98% concentration.
Salvador Panagra Renda, gentlemen.
Si.   In the flesh.
What have you got for me, Manny?
 Renda leaves his apartment every day at 8:30, alone, walks east two blocks to this news kiosk, buys a paper and heads south four blocks to the plaza of the Museum Nacional to read it.
Okay. Chuck, you're here at 8:25. Dress like a tourist. Start walking north. You should pass Renda here. Stop him and ask him in bad Spanish where the museum is. Make sure he doesn't understand what you're asking.
Okay.
 You'll be parked here. Brazioni, you're behind the wheel. Benitez, you're on the street leaning into the car chatting with Benitez. When Chuck stops Renda, you turn to help with the directions, stick a gun into Renda's ribs, and direct him into the back seat. Chuck, you get in first. Renda's between you and Benitez. Brazioni, whaddaya got?
Nice. You got suppresers with those, I'm assuming.
I am not an imbecile.
 Glad to hear it.       Wasn't sure.
 Where are you going to be, Jim?
Poolside, Chuck.
 Hola, Chuckito. Que pasa? YOUNG BARRIS So what'd this guy Renda do anyway?
It's your job to follow directives, not question their validity.
It's just...
He's a bad guy, Chuck.   He's one of the bad guys. Okay?
Bad for the U.S., right, Jim? Not bad in an absolute sense, just bad for the U.S.
Don't fuckin' dance with me, Barris. Renda's bad for the Tea and Biscuit Co. He's bad for me personally. You work for me, and Renda's bad for me. You're now officially a patriotic citizen of the United States of Jim Byrd.
Look, this is --
There's no backing out now, Chuck. We've let you in on everything. So you don't play, you don't leave Mexico. Comprende?
I was just --
 I like you. I really do. And you're gonna do fine tomorrow. And we're gonna become great friends. And you're gonna have a very nice little career. But you've got to grow up. There's a war on.
What war?
 That's not your concern.
Excusa me, por favor, Senor.
Donde es-bla ra-ba-blala los bloteros?
No comprende.
Ra-bla-bla-mamos las minjares?
May I be of some assistance here?
Day of the dead.
Por favor. No me mates, senor.   Tengo tres bebes. Barris sucks in a deep gulp of air. His hand shakes.   He pulls out Spansh-English dictionary.
Again.
Que? BARRIS Repitolo. Again.
No me mates. Tengo tres bebes. Barris flips through the dictionary. A church bell chimes, startling Barris. His gun goes off accidentally and the bullet hits Renda in the face, tearing most of it away. Renda falls, but is still alive. He screams out of where his mouth was. A wedding party emerges from the distant church.
Oh Christ.     Oh crap.
Beautiful country, isn't it?
Yeah.
You did us proud, Chuck.
Renda was a bad guy. He really was.
Yeah.
I had changed. I could see it in my eyes. Something dark.
No me mates. Yo tengo tres bebes.
"Don't kill me. I am three babies." I am three babies? What the fuck does that mean?  Oh. "I have three babies." Oh, God.
 Chuck, is that you throwing up?
Jesus Christ, Penny. You scared the shit out of me. What are you doing here?
Sorry. I just been crashing here for a few days. Waiting for you. Where you been, man, where you been?
Mexico.   Just on a little vaca...
You drank the water, didn't you?
Yeah.
You're not supposed to. Montessori's Revenge. You're not even allowed to open your mouth or your eyes when you take a shower. It's crazy. How come our water is so good and their water is poison? It's the same ocean.
I don't know.
It's weird, huh?  So I'm a hippy now. Look.
I've been in San Francisco, and it's amazing. Everybody loves everybody and there's lots of colors. We're gonna change the world, Chuck. Come back with me and be my old man, okay? Not that old! Ha ha ha.
Penny, I'm a little tired now, so...
Oh!   You gotta hear this song!
 "Cause I made my mind up, you're going to be mine..."
Penny, what did you do to my wall?
 Oh, it's a guy who called a couple a days ago. Gold-Bird. Isn't it pretty?
Leonard Goldberg?! You're kidding?  Hello, this is Chuck Barris returning for Leonard Goldberg.
Hi, Chuck!
Mr. Goldberg! I'm so sorry I didn't get back to you right away. I was out of town. Vacationing in Mexico.
Good for you. Listen, Chuck. We've ended up with a damn hole in our daytime schedule. I've been reviewing some options, and it occurred to me there might be a place here for you and your baby.
My baby, Mr. Goldberg?
The Dating Game.  That is your baby, isn't it, Chuck?
Yes sir, it is.
Are you still interested?
Yes sir.   Very interested.    Sir.
Good man. We'll need to start airing in about six weeks. Is that do-able for you and your people?
My people?     Six weeks?   Sure.   Yes sir.
Great.   Keep me posted.
Damn Mexicans and their water.
Bachelor number two, what would I like most about you?
I am very romantic and I would send you flowers every day.
Aww. That's sweet. Bachelor number three, what would I like most about you?
My big cock.
Bachelor number one, what nationality are you?
Well, my father is Welsh and my mother is Hungarian, so I guess that makes me Well- Hung.
Bachelor number three, I play the trombone. If I blew you, what would you sound like?
Chuck, quite frankly these episodes are unairable.
Look, Len, the show's spontaneous, it's unscripted. That's it's charm. I can't control what people say.
Be that as it may, Mr. Barris, we can't have black men getting blow jobs on national television!
The point isn't that he's black, Hank.
 Well, I know that. That's not what I meant.
Look, Len, nobody is indifferent to these shows. Right? And that's good. Show business must avoid indifference at all costs.
Even when taste is involved?
Taste is just a word.
You don't fuck with taste, my friend!
 What does that even mean?   I don't even under --
Chuck, we cannot air this stuff. That's it. If you can't figure out how to retain your spontaneity without the contestants being lewd, we're going to have to pull the show.
Hi, folks. Before we begin taping today, I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Peter Jenks of the Federal Communications Commission.
 Thank you, Mr. Barris. I don't know if any of you are aware of this, but it's a federal offense to make licentious remarks on a network television broadcoast. The penalty for this disgusting, un-American behavior is one year in prison or a ten thousand dollar fine or both. Anyone making a sick, subversive remark tonight will be arrested immediately. I will then personally escort the offender to federal prison for booking under edict number 364 of the Broadcast Act of 1963. And it's a long drive to that prison. Just you and me. No other witnesses --
 Any questions?
Okay.   Have fun, everybody!'
Sometimes as a younger man I stretched the truth to get what I wanted. "Through all the lying days of my youth/I swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun;/Now I may whither into the truth." Yeats. You heard of him?
Yeah.   Of course.
Sure you have.  Anyway, my little lie worked. We aired and become a big hit. A phenomenon, really.
 Terrific, Rod! Yeah, I'll get back to you on Monday. Great. Thanks. Bye.
 Ice! Ice! Ice! Ice! Ice!
Jesus, Barris, take a Darvon.
Hey, baby.
Asshole.
I know.    Sit. Talk to me.
I'm busy. We're in the middle of a bachelorette crisis out there.
I just got a call from the network. Drink?
You got any weed?
I wish.
Then I'll have a drink.   Bad news?
The Tammy Grimes Show is being pulled from Saturday night.
 Oh my God!  So?
They want to put a prime-time version of the Dating Game on in its place.
Shit! You're kidding!     That's fucking great!
But they say the day-time version's not hot enough. They want me to make it more exciting for night-time. I got forty- eight hours.
What do you have so far?
Nothing. Bupkis. I mean, the show is what it is. I don't have a clue. This could be my big break, Loretta.
Yeah, I know. Don't blow it.
Thank you for your help.
 Hey, I brought the ice.
Boy, didn't I teach you anything?
You son of a bitch!
You're so rusty, it's embarrassing.
You're a stupid fucking turd, you know that?
Can I buy you lunch?
Ah, lighten up, hombre.
My fucking neck hurts.    Okay?
Poor baby. Look, I've been put in charge of a fairly large wet operation and I could use your help.
Have you noticed, Jim, I've got a tv show on the air? I don't need to kill people for hire anymore.
I know you don't need to.    But you'd like to.
That's insane.
Think of it as a hobby. An avocation. Something you do to relax. You can be an assassination enthusiast, a murder bug.
I've got important things to think about here. I don't have time to fuck around with you.
Okay, I'll help you out with your little show. Tit for tat. That's the kinda guy I am. I've seen this Dating Game of yours, Chuck. And I have a thought.
What, now you're a television producer?
Hey, I'm CIA operative John Q. Public when it comes to tv and that should make my opinion of interest to you.
Let's hear it then.
Well, what do you have now? The couple gets sent to some stupid second-rate Hollywood shitcan restaurant, right? Sets you back fifty bucks? That's not too exciting a prize to us vicarious- living boobs out in TV-land.
Yeah, what's your point?
Up the stakes, Chuckles. Send 'em to some exotic locale. Europe, Southeast Asia, for example.
The network's not going to let me send two unmarried kids on vacation together.
 Send 'em with a chaperone. Some respectable old lady with a sewn closed snatch.
 Y'know, that's not half bad.
I'm telling ya. And... And sometimes you can be the chaperone, Chuckie. Let's say we have a job for you in Austria. You, a successful tv producer, above suspicion, chaperones the young couple, and while you're there, blam! you take care of some Company business. It's the perfect cover. TV producer by day, CIA operative by night.
I told you, I don't have to kill people for money anymore.
Chuck, when I said you fit our profile, very little of that had to do with you needing the money. Some of it, but very little. You liked it with Renda, Chuck. I saw it in your eyes. You liked it but you botched it. Don't you want to get really good at something, Chuck?
 Ready one, take one. Ready three, take three. Ready one, take one.
Number one, can you please tell me what a girl is like who hasn't been on a date before and how you can tell she hasn't been on a date before?
Ready two, take two.   This guy has never been on a date.
Well...
Jesus, she's gotta pick this guy.   This is just too good.
... I'll ask her what she likes to do and
Ready one, take one.   Ready two, take two.
And if she doesn't know what she likes to do --
Ready three, take three. The only date he's ever had is with his right hand.
... then I'll know she hasn't done it yet.
Excuse me, is this seat taken?
By you.
London is wonderful this time of year, isn't it.
Yes it is.
 Oh. Sorry.
Excuse me, is this seat taken?
By you.
London is wonderful this time of year, isn't it?
Especially the fog. It affords one solitude, even in a city full of people.
I'm Chuck.
Yes, I gathered.
And you are?
 Here you go, Chuck.
At least give me a made-up name. Something for me to cry out during those dark nights of the soul.
Cry out, "Olivia!"
That's Twelfth Night.
Very good, Chuck. I'm pleasantly surprised. You're not like the other murderers.
I thinks he's really pretty and I want to be her boyfriend.
 Here.
Do you have it?
Do you have it?
Sorry.     Yeah.
Don't worry, we're not gonna cheat you.
Just the same.
Thank you.     Oh, one more thing.
Sorry about your teeth.
It's Ronnie, isn't it?
C'mere, Ronnie. I want to show you something neat. It's okay.
I felt bad about Ronnie. But really I did that ugly, fat, stupid kid a favor. He was ugly and fat and stupid. More life wouldn't have changed that for him. No woman would ever have loved him. That's just the brutal truth, y'know?
Olivia?
It's Patricia, actually.
... and so then I spent a year in Operation Chaos, inside the anti-war movement as an agent provocateur, nudging it toward violence in order to discred it. That was fun. I got to wear granny glasses.
Sounds fun. So tell me, Patricia, why'd you come up here tonight?
I don't know. You're sort of cute in a homely way. And it's always lonely when that civilian you're fucking calls out the name off your fake passport.
"All the information I have about myself is from forged documents."
Nabokov.
Actually, I just gotta go into the bathroom and take care of something.
No, baby.    Leave the microfilm in.
Hey, buddy. This is Simon Oliver.
Hey.
Everything go okay?    You don't look too good.
Mr. Barris, do not ever again jeopardize one of my missions by killing a game show contestant. Is that understood?
You're welcome, pal.
Do I make myself clear?
Fuck you!    They're my contestants.
Amateur.
Faggot.
Chuck --
Lovely. Tell me, Mr. Barris, are you in possession of my microfilm?
Yeah, I got it.
Let's have it then.
It's up my ass, Oliver. Why don't you reach on up there and get it.
I just feel I deserve some appreciation for my efforts.
What do you think Patricia Watson was?
Prick.
Well, if isn't the hitman.
 What?
Hitman!    Hitman! Hitman!   Hitman!
I said, well, if it isn't the hitman. Just heard through the grapevine that ABC is going to pick up The Newlywed Game.
You're kidding me.
Not kidding you. Day-time and prime- time.
Oh, fuck, Loretta.     That's sensational!
Hitman!    Hitman! Hitman!
The Newlywed Game was based on my theory that almost any American would sell out their spouse for a washer-drier or a lawnmower you can ride on. Such was my respect for that most holy of unions. I must've been on to something, because the show aired for thirteen years.
Great wheels, man.
Yeah, I decided to start treating myself right. You spend so much time denying yourself things. Life's too short.
Yeah, I really gork what you're saying, man.
You really grok what I'm saying, man. Not gork.
Oh.  Really?
 Outa sight! Buy this one.
I'll take it.
I'll take the house.
Yay!
So, man, are you seeing anyone?
Nobody serious. You?
No.   I think we should get married.
Aw, Pen, don't start --
No, listen, it makes sense. You and I feel exactly the same about marriage, right? How much bullshit it is, right? And the odds of us finding someone else with the exact same view on it are small. So, it makes sense.
I liked Penny. I even loved her in my way. But the idea of tying myself down for the rest of my life... I remember my parents' marriage.
We need a new ice box.
A brand new Amana refrigerator-freezer with automatic ice maker!
Beautiful. Did you see that? How much they loved each other just then? That's what it's all about, kiddies.
Okay, guys, new business. We're winning our slots every week.
But that means we need you Bandits to get on the contestant mill. Our supply of dumbfucks is lagging behind our demand for dumbfucks. And I'm gonna be introducing three new shows in the coming months: The Parent Game, The Game Game, and the Dollar Ninety-Eight Beauty Pageant, so we're gonna really need you guys to carry your weight. Nuff said. Any other business?
Yeah. Rick took four slices of pizza at lunch yesterday. Everyone else only got two.
Oooh.    Is that true, Rick?    Where are you?
Here.    No, it's not true.
Any other witnesses to this alleged infraction?
I saw it.    He took four.    I only got one.
Rick, you're dead meat, buddy.  I sentence you to... dance for us in today's post-meeting version of "Out of Limits" featuring the musical stylings of the CBP Stompers.
Aw, Chuck.
Get up here, you rascule, you.
Sometimes Chuck would just disappear for weeks. I remember once we had a conflict on the set over the right way to throw that kiss at the end of the show, y'know...  ... and Chuck was just not reachable to resolve it.
What was the conflict?
Look, it's water under the bridge.     I'm not gonna talk about it.
The word's interpret.
Interpet.
Interpret.
Well, do you have an extra "r" then I could borrow?
I'm not going to give you a letter. You're lucky I don't make you forfeit a turn.
Oh.   Okay.
I'll run to the store and get some more.
All right.
Don't cheat.
You neither.
Intrepet's a word, right?
Intrepid.
Shit fuck piss.  Okay okay okay...
Pen, we should call it a night.     I'm kinda tired.
You're tired.
I got a date.
Since when?
I just met this girl.
Like, just now ? You mean just now?
Yeah.    Kinda.
Well, that's rude.
Sorry.
Yeah, well, see ya...
Hi!
Hi!
Wow, this is a beautiful place you got!
Hi.
Hi.
Chuck, this is Mindy, one of my roommates.
Hi.
Have a seat.
So... have you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior, Chuck?
 Yes, I have.
Yeah, I remember that religious girl, sure. Monica Something. Fleming. Oh God, she had the softest, fleeciest clam I ever experienced. It took a little more work than usual, but I got in there, baby. (smacks lips, then stares off into space) It was some clam. Oh Lordy. You get old, y'know, but the taste for soft clam, it just doesn't go away. This is the great tragedy of getting old.
Getting married to Alan is the best thing I've ever done. It's just so wonderful knowing that you've got someone by your side through everything for he rest of your life.
'kay, Mon.     He's off.
My sweet little clamato.
I'm pregnant.
 I can't be pregnant, Chuck.
Is it mine?
I can't believe you asked me that.
I know. I'm sorry.  But you're sure, right?
I hate you so much right now.
Look, we'll take care of it.
How?    Are you gonna marry me?
 Well, no. Not at this point.
I'm not murdering my baby!  I can't... do that. Please...
Beautiful country, isn't it?
Here we are.
 I can't I can't I can't I can't...
It's okay.     It'll be okay.
What a waste.
Tell me about it. I figure over the years I must've spent close to twenty grand on these abortions: airfare, hotels, doctors, gifts.
That's not what I meant.
And I don't even know how many of these fetuses were mine. That's what really kills me.
It was his.
Yeah.   It was his.
It wasn't his. I lied.
Yes, it was his baby.
Yeah.
The godamn son of a bitch.      He asked you to ask me this?
I was screwing a lot of guys at the time. It coulda been his.
Uh-uh. I just needed someone to pay for it. He was a wallet with legs.
Yeah, I was just a kid.   It ruined my life.
I don't really want to talk about this.
So I'm assuming this means Monica is out of the picture.
Yeah, I got baptized for nothing.
Chuck, I was thinking... I have this plan now, now that you're free --
God, you look cute today.
I always look cute. Don't distract me. What was I going to say?
I don't know.
You do know.  Chuck, why don't we get married? We've known each other forever. We've fucked each other forever. You think I'm cute, you just said. You always come to me when you're in trouble. And you're almost forty, Chuck.
 I know how old I almost am! That's it. Don't ever ask me to marry you again!
 I won't.
I'm sorry I yelled at you today, Pen.
I'm not crying because you yelled at me. This is it, isn't it? This is us.
I almost asked Penny to marry me right then. But I didn't.
Is that right?
Chuck?
Chuck?
 Uh.
Rod Flexner's here.
Shit piss fuck, send him in.
Chuck!    Great to see you.
What's up, Rod?
Well, the thing is, Chuck, some of your shows aren't doing too well in the old ratings war. The Family Game, for one.
Okay.
And How's Your Mother-in-Law is, quite frankly, in the toilet, Chuck.
Now, as you know, Dream Girl is flailing terribly.
And The Game Game has no life in it at all.
So I've been put in the unfortunate position of having to inform you that the network is canceling all four of these shows. Now don't shoot me, Chuck, I'm just the messenger.
 They killed my babies. Just like that. I pushed them into the world through the birth canal of my imagination. Lovingly. Tenderly. Where's the humanity of these people?
The fucking bastards.
What am I gonna do now?  Hey there, can I buy you a drink?
What are you blind, asshole?   This lady's with me.
 Fuck you!
Let's see, if I remember correctly, the next move breaks your neck, which kills you instantly or paralyzes you. Depending on your luck.
Please.
 Get out of here, you pussy faggot piece of shit dog-shit shithead.
 Hi. I'm Chuck Barris, tv producer.   Have you ever done any acting?
Hey, I was just in the --
What is she doing here, man?
She's --
This is our house, man. Our house! It's one thing to go elsewhere for your pussy needs. But this is our house!
This is not our house, it's my house.
It's our house! I found it with you. I decorated it for you! I spent six months sitting on that fucking couch she's fucking you on, fucking waiting for the fucking plumbers to come! God, you are such an asshole!
I should go. This doesn't feel right.
I'm dead now. I hope you're happy. The door's open. Love always, Penny
 Wanna see a stupid girl vomit?
Why were you with that girl in our living room?
It's not our living room, Pen.
That's your defense?   You know what it feels like to see you with someone else? In any living room.
You know who I am, Penny.    I don't force you to hang around.
 You don't force me?   Fuck. So you're saying you have no interest in this, one way or the other?
No, I'm not saying that.
Well, then, what are you saying, Chuck? Do you want me around or not? Do you even like me?
Of course I like you.
How much?
What?
I need to know how much you like me.
 I don't even know what that means, "how much?" How can I rate a person in that way? That's ridiculous.
You could if you felt it. If you felt it, it would be easy to rate me. You could spread your arms as wide as they would go and say, "This much, Penny."
Everything's complicated, Pen.    Nothing's black and white like that.
Do you want me around or not? If you don't, just say so, so I know. Okay?
I love you, Pen, in my way. Maybe not in that crazy, head-over-heels thing, but what is that, anyway? Romantic love. Isn't that just an illusion?
 But you just said you love me, right?
Over here, Strawberry-dick.
Jesus, how do you know these things?
We even know what she actually thought it tasted like.
Really? I could never find that out. What did she think?
It's a "need to know", my friend.   So tell me, what can I do you for?
I could really use an assignment, Jim. To straighten my head.
I got something for your head.
... and we're the sending the two of you for three days and three nights to beautiful... West Berlin!
Treesh.
Leibchen.  So, here's what we got.   Name's Hans Colbert.  Other side of the wall.   We don't like him very much.
 Bye-bye, Colbert, bye-bye.
You'll work with a kraut named Keeler. He's been trailing Colbert for a month now. Knows the routine. Keeler's a drunk, so you stay sober and take charge.
 Done and done. See you after?
Prove how much you love me, baby.   Kill for me. Then I'm all yours.
What you writing, Sig?
I am keeping track of all the goings on on this street.
Hey, Keeler, a bird just flew by.
Yah.   I know how to do my job.
 Under the seat, please.
Please, if you don't mind, a photograph. To remember.
 Who is it?
Housekeeping, Mr. Barris.
Good morning, Mrs. Reynolds.
 Another rough night, huh?
 The human psyche is a wondrous thing.
 Yes, I know it is.  We don't need this now, do we?    Why don't we just put this away?
Mrs. Reynolds, may I rest my head on your bosom for a little while?
Oh, that doesn't really seem like a very good idea, Mr. Barris.
I'm sorry. You're right. I just... I'm just without... comfort of any sort, and I... please forgive me.
 No harm done.
 Thank you. Thank you.      Thank you.   You are a scholar and...
It's fine, sir.
Mrs. Reynolds, what do you suppose God thinks of someone like me?
God?
Yes, God.
Well, Mr. Barris, your television shows have brought laughter and joy to millions of people. That's a very important thing, I think, in these difficult times. I would imagine God likes you very much.
Thank you, that's very kind.  So... I should get back to...
Yes, of course, sir. Don't mind me.
I'm really, really fucked.
Get in.
What?       Who the hell are you?
No time.      Get in or die.
Merde. KGB. They know who you are, Monsieur Barris. It is their intention to kill you very much in East Berlin.
Merde!   MERDE! PICARD Not to worry, my friend.
I am Paul Picard, by the way. Nice to meet you. Do not worry, I am not KGB.            I do not want to kill you, I want you to live a long happy life and have many dancing grandchildren to admire.
What the hell is that?
Your ride, Monsieur Barris.
No fucking way.
It's quite reliable and easy to operate. It will get you over the wall. Or you can stay here. In the German Democratic Republic. I will arrange for you to get a good factory job. No, you must fly, like Daedalus before you, to the freedom of the west.
Christ.   What about you?
They do not catch me, monsieur. This is my talent, to get away always. In guerre. In amour. This is my talent, and perhaps this is my curse.
 So, did you have a nice flight?
Fuck you, Jim. It was terrifying.
Seems the KGB knew exactly what you were up to. You were there to kill Colbert, they were there to kill you. I'm thinking we got a mole. So much hate in the world, Chuck.
Am I in danger still?
Jesus, yes. KGB didn't go out of business since yesterday, so far as I know. You're fucked, Chuck. But our main concern should be: if they know who you are, they know who I am.
Fuck off.     What do we do?
Bow out. Lay low. That's what I'm gonna do. You're lucky you have another career to immerse yourself in.
Thank you.     Thanks.   That was great.
I don't know, Chuck. It's looking bleak.
There's gotta be somebody in America with some talent. Ted Mack got bookings every week.
Bring in the next thing.
 Thank you. Thank you. We'll be in touch. That was wonderful.
We've been going about this all wrong. Rather than killing ourselves trying to find good acts, we just book bad ones and kill them.
Chuck, it's torture to sit through even one of these people --
We kill 'em before they're through. As soon as it gets unbearable, we kill 'em. Dead.
For God's sake, what are you talking about?
Celebrity judges ring a bell to end the act... to kill 'em. And when you kill something, it stops. This I know to be true.
Why'd you do that, Jamie? This is someone's grandmother. She was really trying.
This is The Gong Show, not the Van Cliburn eliminations.
This is a human being with aspirations. BARRIS  Oh, fuck me. This guy sucks.     He's bringing everyone down.
None of the hosts are getting it, Chuck. But we have a thought.
What?
You host.
You get it. And we believe your awkward, non-professional, mumbling persona is exactly right for the show.
I don't want to be on tv.
Listen, we can't sit through anymore of these test shows. Do it, Chuck, or we advise the network to pull it.
 Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to The Gong Show! I'm your host, Chuck Barris!  Ucchhh.
And now, here's the host and star of our show, Chuck Barris!
Welcome to The Gong Show. Here's an esoteric act if there ever was one. Ephemeral. It's an ephemeral act.  
BARRIS One that should get us our Emmy. Do we have an Emmy? We don't? Well this should get us one. Anyway, ladies and gentlemen... Big Nose!
Why?   Why?     Why?
I don't know. I don't understand.
 Well, win a few, lose a few.  We'll be back with more stuff... right after this message.
You can't quit.
I can't quit? But I get panicky, Louise, in front of all those people.
You lack confidence, that's all.
I lack confidence?
But we'll take care of that. We'll get you some confidence powder. Leave that to us.
Confidence powder?
Nose candy, Chuck. Blow. Snow.        Flake.
Blow, snow, flake?
Coke.
Oh.   Coke.     Okay.   Does that work?
Ladies and gentlemen, oh, this act is amazing, your gonna love this act. I'm telling ya. All the way from Pacoima... David Pincus!
Oh yeah, a real Jekyll and Hyde. Sometimes nice as you please. Give you the shirt off his back. Other times he'd rant like a crazy man. I remember once he screamed at me that I didn't know anything about dancing. "Nijinsky," he yelled, "now there was a dancer!"
Today I had a bad day today...
It was so bad, my wife didn't even know how to cook. 
BLACK COMEDIAN That barracuda took an egg, put it in a pot of water, and burned the water. We had to rush that to the hospital.
My mother-in-law...
Chuck used to love to discuss philosophy. I think he was very saddened that the public saw him as this sort of spastic moron. I remember at the time I was reading Wittgenstein. And Chuck was just thrilled to have someone else in addition to Rex Reed to talk about that stuff with.
Look, Jamie, you know as well as I that language does not exist without an outward criteria.
Certainly.  Wittgenstein said as much in Investigations. But if you read Ryle carefully --
 Chuck...
Can we pick up tomorrow?
Yeah. But consider my thinking on elementary propositions. I'm serious.
Will do.   Love ya.
Right back at ya, amigo.
I'm concerned about you. I think you need to get back into the life. Our sex was always amazing after you killed. Truth is you're not that great after your discussions with Jamie Farr.
Oh, c'mon.
 Jamie, I can't talk anymore tonight --
 This is Siegfried Keeler.     I need to see you.
Assassins do not fraternize. That Keeler was calling me could mean it was my turn to get hit.
 I am in town on business, Chuck. And I desire nothing more than your company for dinner. I consider you one of my closest friends.
Sure. Dinner sounds good. There's a place called La Scala. See you there at eight.
 Dinner sounds good with whom?
Keeler.
A very fancy place.
Only the best for my friend.
The friendships one develops during wartime are remarkably strong.
Yes.
So how is the business of television?
Well, it's hit and miss. I've got a new show called "Operation Entertainment" which I believe is going to kill. It's sort of a Bob Hope visiting the troops thing, but it's weekly and...
Why do you do what you do, Chuck?
Well, I like to think that I bring joy and laughter to millions of people. I'm not saying that my shows are as good as they could be. Yet. But --
Why do you kill?
Oh.
During the second world war, I had the pleasure of killing. Yes, pleasure. I found it exhilirating. Afterwards, I could find nothing else to fill me so much with life. So I became what I am today. I wanted the exhiliration again... of death.
Are you gentlemen ready to order?
I'll have the shrimp scampi and a green salad.
And for you, sir.
Um, Just give me a steak.    Rare.
Thank you.
"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy whole might. Work while it is called, for the night cometh wherein no man can work."
That's Carlyle!
Yes.
It's amazing you should quote him.   He's my hero.
I read in a book recently that killing your first man is like making love to your first woman. Every smell, every nuance, you remember with a special allure, as if the acts had occured outside civilization, outside time. And when the allure is gone, you are condemned.
Condemned?
I am condemned to live the rest of my life outside civilization. You will be too, my good friend.
The next day I heard Keeler offed himself.
You never really know in the world of espionage if something labeled a suicide actually is a suicide. But he was dead. That I knew.
When you called, I wasn't gonna come.
I'm glad you did, Pen.
I said to myself, enough.      Enough of this jerk already. Enough.
I could see how you would feel that way.
But I've come upon something interesting through my delvings into human psychology. It's called TA, Transactual Analysis.
Transactional Analysis.
Now see, by correcting me you're responding as "Parent" to my "Child."  "Here's the proper way to say this word, Penny." But that's okay. As long as we both understand that's what you're doing. Y'know, I'm okay, you're okay. So what's wrong, Chuck? Are you okay?
A guy I knew killed himself last night.
My God. Everyone you know kills themselves. Or tries. Who is it this time?
You don't know him.   A stagehand.
Why'd he do it?
He didn't like his work anymore.
Is being a stagehand really bad or something?
 Yeah, it's pretty bad.
You were supposed to meet me at The Palm two hours ago.
Oh fuck, I forgot.
Who is this?
I do not get stood up.   Do you understand?
Um, Penny, this is Patricia.  How did you find me?
Are you serious? That's what I do for a living.
Who's Patricia? What does she mean, that's what she does for a living?
You're dead in my book, Strawberry-dick.
Strawberry dick?   What's that?
There is no second chance. Get it?  Nice meeting you, Penny. I've heard a lot about you.  Oh, by the by, Byrd's dead.
And... and okay... I'm only gonna give you one more chance, man. That's it. Get it?
 Who sent you?! Who the fuck sent you?!
Nobody, man. We just waited for you to leave after the show. We just think the show is cool. We just think you're cool.
Please don't kill us.
Hey, Chuck.
Take it off.
Huh?
The fucking bag. Take it off.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Chuck Barris!
Here he is, the Prince of Puns, the Wizard of Whoopee... The Unknown Comic!
Chuckie Baby, Chuckie Baby, Chuckie Baby...
What?   What do you want?
What's the difference between toilet paper and a shower curtain?
I don't know.
 Here's the guy!
Get out of here.
 You're fucking crazy, man.
Phone call from someone named Tuvia.
Who?!
Tuvia?
I'll take it! Don't hang up!
Hello?
Hello, is this Chuck Barris?
Yes.
Oh, this is Tuvia Feldman.    I don't know if you remember me --
Of course I do.
I'm in town and I've been following your career and I wondered if you might want to get a drink. For old times sake.
Sweet Tuvia...
Ripe Tuvia.
Hey, Chuck, I got a talent.
Just take a second.
Chuck?
It's Tuvia! Remember? Hi!
Old Tuvia.
Hi.
You look great.
Ah, Tuvia. The fantasy of Tuvia forever cast out by the reality of Tuvia. Finally, because of my fame and her desperate straits, her poverty and single parenthood, she was going to submit to me. Finally I could've had her.  
BARRIS I could've had what had so long eluded me. But now she was old and I wasn't interested.
Tuvia was old, but not me.   I was the Game Show King.
What?
Paul Picard is dead.
 Fly, Daedalus, fly!
This is the moment we've been waiting for...
The winner is Miss Tiny Brooks!
And the winner is Taxi!
James L. Brooks, Stan Daniels, and Ed. Weinberger, executive producers.
I don't see why your shows are never nominated.
And I honor you, members of the academy, for recognizing and supporting high quality television.
But as I stood there, I realized, I couldn't kill Jim Brooks, the man who was responsible for such good stuff: Mary Tyler Moore, Rhoda, Cindy, Phyllis, episodes of My Friend Tony. I loved those shows as much as anybody in America.
I couldn't kill either of us, so I let us both live. Jim Brooks and me. The rest is history.
Hey, congratulations, Jim.
Oh, hey!   Thanks...
Chuck Barris. The Gong Show.
Oh, right.     Hey, thanks, Chuck.
Once again you deserve it. Your shows are the greatest. You bring so much... quality to the medium. JAMES L.BROOKS Thank you.     I appreciate that.    I really do
In the men's room at the Emmys, he says.
Yeah.
 Great. I'm just heading --
Uh-huh.
Hi.
Hi.
I thought it was you.
 It's me.
I'm glad to meet you because I wanted to tell you that I've seen The Gong Show and I think you are the most insidious and despicable force in entertainment today.
Well --
How dare you subject the rest of the world to your loathsome view of humanity.
I don't think it's that loathsome.
What is it then? To mock some poor, lonely people who just crave a little attention in their lives. To destroy them. So everybody's not brilliantly talented. They're still people. They deserve respect and compassion. I mean, who the hell are you? What the fuck have you ever done that elevates you above the pathetic masses? Oh, I forgot, you created The Dating Game. Wow, right up there with the Sistine Chapel. I guess that's what gives you the right to...
Excuse me, I've got to --
She was right. What the hell had I done with my life?
Wait, you're that guy. You're dead. This is screwy.
I only want to be loved.
That's all I fucking wanted!
Mr. Barris?
No, I'm...
My name is Louise Wechsler and I'm here from Tulsa with my family and...
Please, I'm not feeling well.
Just a moment of your time. I love your show. And, well, I, sort of, have a talent myself.
You can stop by the office to audition tomorrow.
Well, I'm leaving tomorrow and I was just wondering. See, I dance a little and I was just wondering --
Yeah, all right. Go ahead.
Very nice.
That was it. I just disappeared. The network had to put The Gong Show into reruns. It was 1981. I holed myself up in this hotel in New York. Parker Hotel.
Who Am I?
Who cares?     Shut the fuck up!
Fuck.   Shit. Piss.
Barris.
How'd you know where I was?
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, don't be an orangutan. We always know where you are. We always know what you're doing. By the by, I'd think twice before I'd attempt to get that tripe you're writing published. And there's a typo on page --
Look, what do you want, Oliver? I don't work for you anymore. I have things to...
I'd like you to come back for one last assignment, Chuck.
No.     Now get... Good-bye
I think you might be interested when I tell you it's the mole who fingered your friends Jim Byrd and Paul Picard... and Seigfried Keeler.
Keeler committed suicide.
Yes, of course he did. He threw himself from a twentieth floor window after he strangled himself to death with an electrical cord.
 I'm not interested, Oliver.
As long as the mole's alive, you don't have a chance in hell of remaining so. Besides, killing is in your blood, old man. You fit the profile.
That fucking profile again! What's the fuck is it?! What the fuck do you bastards know about me, that I don't?!
Indeed.   Where to begin.   First, let go of me.
Let's see. Well, you had a twin sister, stillborn, strangled by your umbilical cord. Your first hit, Chuck. Your mother always wanted a daughter. She blamed you for your sister's death. And, so, until your sister Phoebe was born, she raised you as a girl.
That's not true.
Oh, and your father the dentist? Not really your father. Your biological father was a man named Edmund James Windsor. A serial killer. A fact your mother didn't know when she had an affair with him in 1930. If you want to look him up, he was also known as the Tarrytown Troll, because he had been described by witnesses as short and ugly. Windsor died in the electrical chair at Ossining in 1939. We believed your self- loathing tendencies coupled with that extra Y chromosome and whatever else you inherited from your father would serve us well.
You're lying.
I'm trying to think what more I can tell you. I'm sure there's more. But you have me at a disadvantage here, Barris. I don't have your files in front of me.
Just leave me the hell alone!
Your mother always loved the game shows, and you so wanted to please her. We never expected the game show business to work out for you. But that it did, turned out to be in our favor. I guess your need to be a good daughter drove you more than we anticipated.
Huh?     What?
Chuck?    It's Pen.
Oh, Chuck.
Jesus, how'd you find me? Am I listed in some guidebook or something?
You sent me your last letter on hotel stationary.
Oh. Well, it's great to see you, Pen. You look beautiful.
I don't really. But I appreciate the lie. I know how you hate lying.  Boy, this place is scary looking.
Yeah.  The human psyche.
I came to take you back to California with me. It's a lonely state without you.
I don't know, Redhead.
I can't wait forever for you to ask me to marry you, you know. Well, apparently I can. But I really don't want to. Chuck.
Pen.
 I love you so much. You don't understand. I don't even know why. You're such a schmuck.
You don't know the half of it.
You're not gonna marry me, are you?
I don't know if I can.
I can't believe you finally left your two- hundred-dollar-a-night cave to see me. I'm honored.
Y'know, I got a visit this morning from Penny. She's wanted to marry me forever. But she doesn't know who I am, what I've, what I'm capable of.  
BARRIS And she can't ever know. So what does she really love? A lie. And I started thinking, Treesh, you are the only woman in the world who truly knows me. I know I've screwed you over in the past, and I'm really sorry. I just want you to know that you're the one I want to be with. I love you, Treesh.
I hate myself for how I've lived, Treesh.
Neitzsche said, "Whoever despises oneself still respects oneself as one who despises."
I never thought of that. Jesus, I can't even despise myself with any insight.
Insane asylums are filled with people who think they're Jesus or Satan. Very few have delusions of being the guy down the block who works at an insurance company. Wonder what that means.
Y'know, I wanted to be a writer once. I wanted to write something that someday some lesser person would quote. But I never did. I'm the lesser person, Treesh. I never said anything meaningful that wasn't said by somebody else first. I am disposable. I disposed of people and I am disposable.  You look cold.
Chuck, what's gotten into you? You're actually acting like a gentleman.
Well, it's late. I should get going.
I suppose you still won't tell me where you're staying.
No.   But I'll show you.
Drink?
Sure.    Bourbon.
I've been thinking a lot about you lately, Chuck.
Yeah?
I've missed you.
You could've fooled me.
Well, I've mellowed.
Look. Boston's a beautiful city. We could start over here. A normal person's life. Together. Selling insurance.
That sounds right.
To life.
To life.
 L'Chaim.
It's done and I'm done.   Agreed?
Agreed.   But if you get antsy... and you will.
Hey, Redhead?
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE You all know Chuck Barris: the creator of The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game, The Family Game...
Drive, Danny! Now!
What's going on?
 Pen, I have something to confess.
Okay.
 You know me as the creator of The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game, The Family Game, The Game Game, How's Your Mother-in-law, Dream Girl of 1968...
Operation Entertainment.
Yeah, Operation Entertainment. The Rah- Rah Show, Gong Show, The Dollar-Ninety- Eight Beauty Show, The Ra-Rah Show...
You said that already.
Okay.  Okay, but what you don't know is that I've brutally murdered thirty-three people for the CIA.
Y'know, I came up with a new game show idea recently. It's called The Old Game. You got three old guys with loaded guns on stage They look back at their lives, see who they were, what they accomplished, how close they came to realizing their dreams. The winner is the one who doesn't blow his brains out. He gets a refrigerator.
