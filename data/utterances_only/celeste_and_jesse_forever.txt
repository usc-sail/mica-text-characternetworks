I'm a Love Rhino...
Don't worry `bout me, I've Dont' worry `bout me, I've got a enough love for got enough love, for the two the... us. Oh please... oh shit, I gotta take this. Turn it down.
...I'm a Love...
Jess, turn it down, seriously!
Hello? Hi. With Jesse, running errands.  Turn it down. More.  Yeah, I can do it now. No, it'll be fast, right?  Hey, I have to give a quick sound bite for the New York Times, so no noise please? For a second?
Maybe. I may have an important call coming in too, so...
Okay. Ready? This year all trends point towards simplicity and comfort.
Jess, just go around him! (To the phone) Sorry. 
Consumers will be less likely to go out for entertainment.
Uhhh, things like Voodoo, casual wear and cookbooks will see a huge spike in the market.
What the shit??
Shhh. Phone call. That's enough of a blurb, right?
Does this tooth look dark?
Okay. Call me back if they need more.
Like a little darker than the rest?
Okay, thanks bye.  Can't you just sit still for two minutes? And we talked about this, no more smoking!
I wasn't smoking, I just found it.
Come on.
Really? Street lamps? No. Not doin' it. That is not art.
I think it's beautiful.
What are you doing? Why are you stopping?
Well, your appointment is not until noon and this is that place with the deadstock vintage Italian fabric. I thought it would be good for the guest room windows.
Oh wow...you are so thoughtful.
Thanks, Jess.
Whassup, muthafucka??
Jess, that place is insane. They have tassels that were manufactured for Mussolini's mistress...
Sorry, I'm on the phone. It's important.
Okay then.
Really? I just...don't know what to say. Thank you so much for calling me.
Did you get the job??
Well, sometimes things are just meant to work out.
Okay, great. Great. Talk soon. Bye.
Was that the job? Did you get the book job?
No, but Celeste...
...a swell came in last night. Out of the Northeast. It's overhead and it's glassy.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Malibu. The waves are peeling out there.
Is this about surfing? You're talking about going surfing. Unbelievable.
No, this is best part. Skillz got a hi-def digital camera and he's gonna film me!!!
Oh, god.
And we're gonna upload it on You Tube!
I'm not...
What? Is that not awesome?
No, yeah, I just thought it was about the Slate job you interviewed for.
Oh yeah. No. They haven't called yet. But if they don't think I'm the right artist to illustrate the book, then it's not the right job for me. You know what I mean?
I absolutely do, yes. You are a wonderful artist. But at some point, you will show the world that one day...right?
Hey, can I drop you at home now? Because I just missed a wave.
Well...
Wait! I just missed another one.
Yeah. Take me home, it's fine.
Be back by six so you can shower.
Why shower?
Dinner with Beth and Tucker.
Right, right.
Have fun shredding your glassy peel.
Aw, so wrong.
Love you.
Love you too.
Did you end up going to see that band at Spaceland last week?
Oh, The Injured Saint? Yeah, dude. They are real. You know what? They should be your wedding band. 
They're loud but they're affordable.
They opened for Darcy Fudged His Knickers. Now, they're amazing. You'd be lucky to book them for your wedding. Or you should see if Emergency Breakthrough is available. The horn section is tight.
It's already done. We got the best swing band in New England. Sugarfoot and The Swingin' Scrod.
I told you, I'm not doing it. Swing is so late 90's, honey.
I love you. We'll talk about this later.
So veee ahhh gawwnna share zeh beet zalad and zeh bolognese, riiiiiiight?
Yawh. But I em murdering zeh creme brulee alooooone. No sharrrrring.
I don't vant dessert. I vill joost have bite oof yorrrs.
Ve know zeh end of zat story. Yawh we doooooo!
Yawh!!!!
I can't do this. I just can't.
Are you okay? Oh no...
It's just not right. I can't hold my tongue. We can't do this anymore.
Honey, weddings are stressful, I know all about it. But you guys we'll be fine!
NO. WE are fine. What the fuck are YOU TWO doing??
What do you mean?
Yeah, what do you mean?
What do I mean?? You guys are not together anymore! This is not normal! You've been separated for SIX MONTHS and you hang out every day like nothing's wrong! It's fucking weird!
Beth...
No, Tucker, you think it's weird too. Speak up for yourself.
It's weird. Let's not play charades anymore.
No charades. We are separated and we're friends. You guys should be happy, all we did was fight before.
Yeah, you guys should be thrilled about this. You'll never have to pick sides.
Yeah, everyone's cool.
Everyone is not cool! This is not cool! It's just not working for me, I'm sorry.
Bett iz zo angry.
Yah, she iz uber angry. Yahhh.
Yeah, you guys are weird. I can't do this. It's fucked up.
C, look...uhhhh!
Ahhhhh! Oh god!
Beth and Tucker are crazy.
Crazy.
It's not weird that we hang out. Do you think it's weird we hang out?
No, of course not. You're my best friend.
Yeah you too. I mean, we can't not hang out. The last time we didn't talk for longer than a week was in 10th grade when you went to Space Camp Canada.
Yeah, that was 6 weeks of torture. I mean, the anti-gravity training was insane but I missed you.
Well, I'm exhausted.
Me too.
Hey, it's kinda chilly tonight, how's the heat in there?
Oh, it's fine. I'm fine.
Sorry I'm still living here. Times are tough and money's tight so you know...
Jesse, please, you can stay here as long as you like. It's your studio. It's actually really nice to have you here.
For me too.
Oh, don't forget, the contractor needs to get in there for measurements in the morning. So make sure your thingys, your sculptures, whatever...are out of the way.
Got it.
Night.
Night. Love you.
Love you too.
Large coffee, please.
Excuse me, sir?
Sir? You?
You do realize that you just cut in front of a lot of people.
Oh. Sorry, I didn't know.
Did you not?
I'm in a rush.
So you did know. And everyone's in a rush, so...
Well, she was looking at the pastries, I didn't think she was ready to order.
Well, it's not just her. It's everyone behind her too. So, if you want to ask all these people if it's okay to cut in front of them because you are late, be my guest. Just don't assume that your time is more important than everyone else's.
Have a nice day.
Prick.
American culture is dying. We have an unrelenting appetite for processed junk food, talentless pop stars like Riley Banks and recycled movie franchises like Transformers. The more we consume crap, the more we want crap.
Sounds utterly hopeless. Is there an upshot?
I think there will be a groundswell movement towards simplicity. People will start to listen to their most rudimentary needs-- they will crave mental, spiritual and physical nourishment. It's back to basics.
Wow, a lot to chew on. Well, thanks for being with us today. You're great, come back any time. For more on this gloomy but interesting subject, look out for trend forecaster, Celeste Martin's new book "Shitegeist," on bookshelves Monday.
Thanks so much, Rachel.
So I had dinner with the drama club last night.
Who's that?
Tucker and Beth. They're such dicks. They left in protest because they think Jesse and I are being "unhealthy." So judgy, right? We're fine.
You're only done when you're done.
Spare me the spiritual platitudes, Scotty. If we were gay,(she motions to Scott) no one would even question us being friends!
You and Jesse are clearly not ready to let each other go. And there's nothing wrong with that.
Yeah there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, what do you think?
Well, to be honest...
Wait, we're signing Riley Banks?? When were you going to tell me?? I just trashed her on Rachel Maddow. Great.
Yeah, that's why I wanted you to come in. It's a huge account..
Scott, you and I built this company so we wouldn't have to take an account like Riley Banks.
Well, you and I may not have a company if we don't take Riley Banks. Recession, remember?
She's like a...soul-less hologram.
She is releasing a new album. She wants us to do the branding and merchandising. We need to take this account.
Ok. Fine. I'm gonna go eat lunch.
If you are looking for my opinion, I do think you should start dating.
I don't do dating. The right guy will show up. And I'm still on track for my 25 year plan.
No one has a 25 year plan. Except for my mortgage company.
First child at 33. Second at 35. Which means I will only be 56 at my eldest's college graduation. The bad news is that I may not be at my 4th grandchild's high school graduation. But that's okay, I guess.
I'm fascinated with the mentally ill.
I've got time. I'm not worried.
Well, do me a favor and get your fuck on before you meet the next guy.
What are you doing?
Sorry, I was trying to be your saucy gay friend. It didn't feel good.
Yeah don't.
The economic climate is real bad, man. And I think my business is taking the hardest hit of all. It's brutal. And no one's talking about it.
You sell pot.
Not for long, dude. Have you been to those weed pharmacies? They're killing me. I gotta branch out. Maybe start working in methamphetamines? Or maybe teach pre-school. I always wanted to do that. I love kids.
Sorry, I know this is serious talky time but would you look at the fucking seat on that girl?
THAT is a party.
I don't think it's over.
What? Her butt? No, it will never be over. It goes on forever. It's like space. So great.
No, Celeste and I. I think she's just confused and overwhelmed right now about everything. But she'll come around. She always does.
Uh oh. It's been a while now. I think it's over, bro. It may be time to accept that and move on. Call that dime Veronica.
That was a one time thing, a couple months after Celeste and I broke up. Celeste does not know about that. And we will keep it that way.
Didn't know that was a hit and run. Sounded like you liked her.
Well, she's not Celeste. It's always been Celeste. I'm not ready to give up.
Okay, but remember, you can't re- heat a souffle.
Huh?
Also, there's Bettys everywhere. It's LA. Maybe it's good to remind Celeste that you can pull wool. Make her sweat a little bit.
It definitely wouldn't hurt to...go out with somebody.
Do you know what you want?
Yeah, I want to not be a quitter. I don't want to start all over again. I want everything that I believed to have been true to be true. I also want a goji berry/green tea swirl with yogurt chips and Fruity Pebbles. Please.
Hey, you should go out on a date with my friend here.
Um, wait, where's your wife? You guys are here like everyday together.
Well...we're separated.
Oh. Cool. I mean, bummer. But okay. I'll go.
It's so...grotesque.
But kind of beautiful. In a grotesque way.
Ugh, let's keep moving. Too many feelings.
I need to say this and then I'll never bring it up again. I'm sorry I wigged on you guys the other night but I don't know what you're doing. I think it's stupid that you're not together. You are best friends and that's the hard part. Nothing else matters.
Beth, the reality is I love Jesse dearly but he doesn't have a checking account. Or dress shoes. The father of my children will have a car. But...Jesse will always be my best friend.
Okay fine. I've said my peace. It's your life. But I definitely don't think he should be living in your guest house. I think you're kind of breaking his heart. Slowly.
Jesse is fine.
Can I show you something?
Sure.
Okay. Look.
What am I looking at?
It's a hair. On my NECK.
Ewww. Will you get that thing lasered off, please? What the fuck?
I can't because it will pop up somewhere else where I can't keep my eye on it.
Are you serious? That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. It's not a turnip.
Trust me, I know my body. It's a cruel land mine.
Okay, well at least pluck it for Chrissake.
I should, at least before my wedding, right?
What is wrong with you?
AHHHHHHHHHH!
Sorry sir, my friend has a really strong emotional reaction to modern art.
That was fucking rude.
Had to be done.
Hey...you're not working? Are you watching the Olympics? Again? And crying? Again?
Yeah.
God, you really love that, don't you?
Matthias' wife died in a car accident last year.
Well, three years ago now but...
And he dedicated his gold medal to her. The human spirit is...unbreakable.
Uh huh. Hey, did you finish that artwork for the Pop Form website?
Huh? Oh yeah, I'm almost done. I'm working on it. I think you'll really like it.
I'll like it more when I have it because I needed it yesterday, so...
Celeste, can you sit down for a minute? I have something really important to tell you.
Oh. Okay. Does it have something to do with the work you owe me?
I don't know how to tell you this but...I have a date tonight. I'm gonna start dating. People.
A date? Really? That is so great.
It is? You don't...
Yeah! Don't cry. Good for you, Jess.
That doesn't bother you? Wow, okay. Well, it's actually the Yogurt Girl. From Yoga Yurt?
Really? Yogurt Girl, huh. She's cute! But so young, right?
Super young. Her body is all-time.
Okay, no need for that. But this is good! You gotta crawl before you walk. I mean she's definitely not gonna be wifey number two, right? Ha.
Well, it's just a date.
Big move. I'm proud of you.
Thanks?
Can I get up now?
Huh? Yeah, sure.
Yeah, Skillz kinda made me do it and from the get go, she was way into...what are you looking at?
No, nothing. Are you gonna wear your hair like that?
What? Oh. I don't know, is it weird?
Not weird, just different from how it looks best.
Anyway, this is what we're doing right? We're getting divorced and we're friends and we're also dating people? That's what we're doing?
There. Better. You'll be great. You don't even need to be great. Just be you. Take her somewhere nice.
Okay mom.
Call me after?
So I was in school but then I dropped out because I really wanted to work in fashion but it's really hard to find a paid internship? So I went back to school and now I work at Yoga Yurt part time but I'm really looking to make money doing something I love? But I'm sure the universe is looking out for me and when the time is right, the right thing will come along, you know?
Where is it? They told me it would be in new releases...
That's what I call placement.
Well you probably shouldn't steal it. Even if it is yours.
There.
But you don't have the "O" on your cover, you can't do that!
Yes I can.
There you guys are...you're on Oprah's Book List?? That's so great!
Some people are browsing my book. Guys, come with me to eavesdrop ...
Jesse?
Veronica?
Yeah, hey. How are you?
Good, good. You look great.
Thanks, you too. How's your clothes pin collage going?
Slowly, but it's going.
Well, don't give up. Your work is really unique. And beautiful. I hope that doesn't sound...
No, that's means a lot, thank you.
I had so much fun...that night. I'm so sorry I didn't call you. My life is just...
I had a lot of fun too.
Oh sorry, Veronica, this is Beth and Tucker and Celeste.
Oh, this is your book? I read an excerpt online, it's really compelling.
Wow, thank you. That is so nice.
Well, nice to see you.
Oh you too. Take care.
What is that?
That was uh...Veronica.
Story?
No story. Just this girl I met a while ago.
Huh. She's pretty.
EXCUSE ME SIR? WHERE CAN I FIND MORE COPIES OF THIS BOOK "SHITEGEIST" FOR MY FRIENDS? I HEARD IT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!
Oh baby youuuuuuuu, you got what I neeeeeed...
And you say he's just a friend, and you say he's just a friend....
Oh baby youuuuu.... Oh baby youuuuu....
No, no, no. Ignore for sure.
Uh, I just need to... Hey.
Nooooo!
Uh huh. Okay. Okay. No, I'm not busy. Uh, I'm gonna go home.
Come on, after the show it's the after party.
There's an Ikea dresser that she needs me to "build."
Huh. Really, cowboy? Are you guys...
I told you pal, I know what I'm know I'm doing. She just needed time.
I'm in here! Fuck Sweden!
Oh baby youuuuu....
It was definitely easier to build the Brooklyn Bridge, I think.
Well, how hard can it be? It's a dresser, right?
Fuck me!!! Do you think they intentionally pick a random piece of furniture to make totally unbuildable, just to fuck with you??!
Thank you!
Wait. I got it.
Perfect.
Fucking lay-up.
Ruscha meets Basquiat...
...meets Serra meets Corky from "Life Goes On."
Yeah. He's a vegan, you know.
Cherish. That is so cute.
You're cute.
Hey. What are you doing?
I love you.
Okay...
We should talk about this.
Yeah. Whoa, we were drunk. What a bad idea. I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry. It was nice. And I love you.
Oh Jess, I don't...come on, we were drunk, and the dresser and I thought...you're dating other people!
Only to...god, I'm so stupid.
Oh no, I thought...
You thought what?
Well, clearly I wasn't thinking. Or I wouldn't have let it happen. Come on Jess, we're not getting back together, you didn't think...
You know, there's a guy that you can call, from Ikea, that will build you're dresser. You should call him. Hell, he'll probably fuck you too. I'm a fucking idiot.
Jess! No, I didn't..Jess!
Hello.
What?
I said hello.
Oh. Hi.
How was your practice?
My practice?? It was...wait, what?...it was fine. (who is this guy?)
I see you in class a lot. You have a great warrior two. Are you single?
Are you really doing this right now? You're really doing this right now.
Yeah, I can't believe it either. I don't do this, it's just happening, I can't stop...it...what do you do?
Just gonna jump right in there. Wow, Captain Conversation.
Paul. Here's my card.
You bring cards to yoga??
Look, you're really pretty. I'm not good at this. Help.
A financial analyst. Cool.
Not really. It's not cool. Did you ever tell me what you did for a living?
No, no I didn't.
Well, will you? I'd love to know.
I'm a trend forecaster. I forecast trends.
Trend forecaster. Really? Huh.
You traded in your Porsche for an Audi because the economy is tanking and you're afraid you'll lose your job soon. You bought a Samsung cell phone because you think it makes you seem more "business-oriented," unlike the iPhone which is for teenage girls. You go to yoga because you went to a sub Ivy League college, spent the last ten years working long weeks and drinking all weekend and you feel like it's time to do something "spiritual." Nice to meet you, Paul.
No, just make sure the San Fran focus group has a little more diversity than last time. It was like a rave. Without drugs. Okay.
Hey, Jess, it's me. I'm getting on a plane but I'd really like to talk to you. I don't know what happened last night. Hope you're okay. Call me.
I'm glad you called.
Hey. It's me. Again. I miss you. Anyway, call me. Okay. Bye.
I love you. I'm so sorry. I've always loved you.
Of course. Stupid.
Hey. You're back. I want to talk to you.
Yeah, I want to talk to you too. Where have you been?? It's been like two weeks. So much to lay down...like, did you know that pay- per-view porn is available in Cantonese?
Really? Like subtitles or dubbed? Wait, actually, I'm really close to your house right now. Can I come by for a minute? It's....important.
Okay. I have to tell you something.
Me too. Wait, you first. Are you gay?
No, not gay.
Um, you're not gonna believe this but...
Oh no, did you go on another date?
I'm having a baby.
I don't understand.
I'm having a baby.
What do you mean?
I am having a baby.
With another person?
Yes. With another person.
Um. What? Sorry, I'm confused. Wait, what? What the fuck? With whom?
With Veronica.
Veronica?? What's a Veronica?
You actually met her. That day at the book store.
Huh. But that's not even physically possible, that was two weeks ago.
Well, the truth is, I slept with Veronica three months ago. It was just a one night thing. But she's pregnant.
Whoa. Okay. Shit. Didn't know about that. But that's not important right now. This is not good. Alright. Okay. You and I are gonna deal with this. We will, we'll just have to. What do you need me to do?
No, you don't have to do anything.
But you don't even know this person, right?
Yeah I know her. I mean, I'm getting to know her. And I really want to make it work with her.
Make it work?? You slept with her once! What are you talking about?
I've actually been seeing her, well, a lot, recently. And I think I really like her.
So what you're saying is you got a girl pregnant and now you think you like her because she's pregnant? Or...I'm really confused.
The universe is fucking weird, Celeste. I slept with her months ago and never called her after. 
But we started hanging recently and she told me she was pregnant with my child. I know it's crazy, but it just feels...right. It was like this really weird retroactive gift. I don't know...
Can you excuse me for a second?
Sorry about that. I had something in my eye.
Right. Look, I know this is so sudden. And so weird. I've been holding on to us, this idea of us, for so long. And I know you've wanted me to let go. So I'm sorry. You were right, we're friends. We will always be friends. And I need that now.
Of course.
Thank you. Love you.
Wait, you had something to tell me too. Sorry...
It was nothing.
Hello?
Hey.
What are you doing?
I'm just following Diddy Twitty.
I don't...know what that means.
It's Sean Comb's Twitter page. There's also a singing competition on television. It's called American Idol? Keep up.
Okay saucy. You don't have to be so saucy.
Well, just part of our job, so...ready for breaking news? Jesse is having a baby with some girl. Crazy.
Whoa. Wow. Did you even know he was seeing someone?
It's this girl he slept with once a couple of months ago. 
And now he's "making it work" with her. Plane crash.
I don't know what to say. I am so sorry, Celeste.
No need, Scott, I'm totally fine.
Are you?
Look, I wasn't going to have his baby. So, good for him.
Well, it's great that you're so resolved about this but it's also okay for you to have feelings. It's very sudden.
Right. Well, let me see...mmmm, nope, I'm fine. I promise. Not in love with him anymore. It kind of makes it easier.
Oh my god, Diddy's snowboarding for the first time in Mammoth! Amazing. I actually have a date tonight.
Um...that's great. Who's the guy?
The yahoo who did Pop Form's taxes last quarter. He's been asking me out forever. Not the one, but it'll be nice to be admired.
I agree, go be admired. Who knows, you may actually even simulate human emotion.
Thank you.
My foot actually pronates. And my I.T. band is strained when I run, which really hurts. So Dr. Ozar recommended a foot specialist who made these customized orthotics for me and it's amazing how much better I feel.
Well, actually I...
OH MY GOD. My ex is here. Oh god, oh no, we just made eye contact. Maybe he didn't see me. Wait, he did. He's coming over. Oh god, this is so awkward. You should probably leave.
Wait, what? I don't think...really?
Yeah, just go.
Too late. Here he is, heyyyy.
I just wanted to say hi. I'm Jesse.
Oh, this is Matt.
Max.
Mack.
Max.
Nice to meet you, Max.
We're just here. Just eating. It's a date. I'm dating.
Cool. The puttanesca special is the thing to get.
Good to know. I ordered that.
Who are you here with?
Oh, just here alone. Watching the Lakers.
Kobe-LeBron tonight, right?
Yes. Epic.
So psyched I tivo'ed it.
Nice to meet you, man. Good to see you, C.
You too. You too.
He's cool.
Uh huh.
How was that? Are you okay?
I'm fine!
He always loved the meatballs here.
What?
Nothing. Do you like bread?
Bread? Um, yeah, I like bread.
Cool, cool.
This was great! I'm free next Wednesday? Sushi?
Um, I don't think we should.
Oh, because of mercury poisoning? I think that's a myth. I go to this acupuncturist that...
No, I think you may need some time. To get over, you know, your divorce. It took me a long time to start dating after mine.
Thank you for your concern but I'm just fine. I guess you're just not a match for me.
Well, have a good night. Good luck.
Whatever.
Hi honey!
Hi, wow, you are really out of breath. Did you fucking run here?? From West Hollywood??
Yeah I ran. Just started. It's really fun.
You're soaking wet. Isn't that like 12 miles??
13.5 actually. I was just clearing my head, you know, keeping the endorphins up.
Do you...want to sit down?
Oh, okay! Wow, is this it? It's so nice.
I'm so sorry but that's a one-of-a- kind piece that was handwoven by a tribe of Afghani women. So if you could maybe just sit over there?
Right. Sorry. Totally.
Wow, you are a sweat tsunami.
You should get it. It's really pretty.
Uh boy.
Don't worry. I know people who can get that out. Easily.
Okay. I guess I'm getting it.
The Riley account is a handful. I've been sooooo swamped.
It's great you're staying busy...
If it doesn't come out, I can have it reupholstered.
Thanks. How's dating?
Sorry, can I get your card?
Here you go.
Great. Dating's really great.
Have you talked to Jesse?
No, but I actually ran into him last night. I think he's getting a little fat.
I think he's been looking pretty fit lately.  Can I get a rush delivery on that?
So you've seen Jesse?
...Yeah, I have.
Huh. Have you hung out with...
Veronica?
Yeah.
Yes. I have.
So, my first available delivery is Monday afternoon. Does that work for you?
Yeah, that's fine. If you can you just call my cell...
She's dumb, right?
Huh? Oh no, not dumb. Simple.
Simple means dumb.
No, actually, simple in a really elegant way.
Elegant??
Okay, so you're all set then.
Elegant??
Thanks a lot.
I thought you would be happy for him.
I am, I just didn't realize that Monica was "elegant."
Veronica. And you know what? You would probably really like her.
You're not having regrets about Jesse?
Not one.
Please let me drive you home. I'm afraid you'll drown.
Sure. I have a date tonight so I should probably shower before then.
Yes. Shower. Who's the date?
Rupert Bates.
Rupert Bates? The Gap model?? Oh my god, he's so hot but he's like 15.
22. Skillz set me up. He's about to be a huge star. He's filming "20,000 B.C.?" It's the prequel to "10,000 B.C."
Fuck, I LOVED that movie.
I loved that movie too! It really spoke to me.
That was so...good.
I wrote that for my mum.
Lucky lady. So how do you know Skillz?
He provides me with the happy smoky green treats.
Ew.
Hello, Special One.
Oh...hi. Oh god.  Oh no, no, no I gotta go.
Ugh. My hair is so dry. It looks like straw.
Here. Do you want an Adderall?
No, that shit makes me feel like a robot. Speaking of robot, who the hell designed this place? It's like Spock and his eyebrows are about to walk around the corner.
Hi Riley, I'm Celeste, I'm a partner at Pop Form.
Hey. Wow, you're pretty.
Why am I breaking out?
Too much sugar? Coffee? Alcohol?
Ugh, maybe it's my skin regime.
Um...it's actually regimen?
Sorry?
Regime is a system of government. It's a "skin regimen."
Thanks, Scrabble. Nice to meet you.
Charming.
Celeste has some ideas for the logo which are looking really great.
Celeste? Do you wanna...
Right. Yes. Sorry. So we are going for an industrial feel with the artwork...
Hello, Special One.
Uh, you got my IM.
Sounds so awful.
Where are the guys who don't wear makeup for a living? And maybe a little intellect? A little intellect wouldn't hurt anybody.
Wait, wait. You've never met Nick, right? Nick Moran?
The photographer? You know him?
Yeah, we went to school together. This could be perfect.
 I'm uncomfortable with daaaaaating. I don't like any of iiiiiit.
Trust meeeee. You will liiiiike hiiiim. Also, I love cooo-ooock.
You really got to try a little harder to integrate the gayness, Scott.
So you pissed in your pants?
I waited seven hours. Three of them soaking in my own pee. But I finally got the shot of Ahmadinejad.
Wow. That is incredible. I think he's smiling, maybe.
He is. I think the piss stain running down my jeans made him laugh.
Well, the world will think you're brilliant. No one will ever know but me.
I was nominated for a Pulitzer. I didn't win.
Well, the guy who won shit his pants, so...
Oh my god, we missed our reservation. It was at 8:30. Should I call down and see if they can still take us?
How about room service?
Perfect.
That was really, really nice.
Um, yeah. So, what are you doing for the rest of your life?
Making out with you.
I don't remember it ever feeling like this.
What are you doing?
What do you think I'm doing?
Why are you doing that? Don't do that..It was going so well.
Shhhhh.
Watch me. I'm almost there.
Almost where?? No!
Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhh!
Celeste?
Hey, so, I'm glad you can meet up. 4pm is good. There's this little place by me, Vegan Vittles on Elysian Way, kinda hard to find, call me if you get lost.
Vegan Vittles.
No, I don't want to do a video chat. Yeah. Just tell her she needs to get to L.A. tomorrow. Okay. (she hangs up, now on the Blackberry) Sorry, one second, I just have to send this e-mail.
There. Hi.
Hi. What's up?
A lot.  Can I get some coffee?
We have yerba matte?
Um, green tea?
We have decaf green tea.
Water's fine.
K. Anything for you?
I'll get the veganchilada with the cashew cheese sauce on the side. Oh can I look at the seaweed menu?
Oh. Awesome. You do have the Baltic kelp today. I'll get that. Thanks.
Wow.
How are you? You look great.
Thanks.
Are you wearing...dress shoes?
Oh yeah, they're vegan.
You look good too.
A lot of pilates.
Huh, I didn't know you did pilates.
Yeah, well, Veronica's a dancer and has equipment at our house, so...
How's work?
Um...work is great.
Good.
My book is getting great reviews. Riley Banks is a new client which is huge. Things are going really well.
Great.
Listen, I know this has all been pretty weird.
It's only weird if you think it's weird.
Celeste, I never wanted to hurt you.
Thank you. You didn't. Glad we cleared that up.
Look, I actually wanted to see you because...apparently there's some kind of hold up on your side with the divorce papers and Veronica's actually not a citizen so..
What? Where's she from?
Uh, Belgium.
Huh. Belgium. Elegant.
What?
Nothing.
Point is, we need to...get married. I'm sorry. I really need you to sign those papers.
Well, Jesse, I've been busy with work. Because some people work for a living. So I haven't really been focused on what I can do to help you get on with your new life.
I'm sorry. I know.
What makes you think you are even suitable to be a dad?? You don't even know how to read the electric bill. How are you going to support yourself? Have you even thought this through?
I guess I'll have to figure it out. Veronica is really supportive of my work.
Really? Really Jesse? I paid the rent for ten years. If that's not supportive, I don't know what is.
That's true. And thank you.
We never even talked about kids.
You had reservations about having kids.
I had reservations about having kids with YOU.
Well, ditto. I think Veronica will be a really good mother.
Low blow.
I'll sign the fucking papers. I don't have time for this. You're ridiculous, this place is ridiculous. Fucking vegan kelp cashew bullshit. What the fuck is this place anyway. 
Do any of you have jobs?? Anyone? What do you do? Wait, let me guess. You grow pot.
Um, yeah. I do.
Exactly. Get a real job.
Jesse's a fucking vegan??
A vegan who's soon to have his work shown. At the Gagosian.
The Gagosian?? You're kidding. What, the fucking clothespin thing? When?? 
Don't tell me actually...how did anybody even know about his art, he doesn't...I don't actually want to know...god, he's on fire right now. Breaking up with me was the best thing that ever happened to Jesse. I should break up with me.
Now, now. Someone else's success is not your demise, C.
Shut up. Unless it's Jesse's. Who are dressed as again?
Beiber.
Ooh, he just got a buzzcut.
Really? Fuck. When??
A couple hours ago. It was on Perez.
That's so sad. His hair was everything.
I need to fucking drink.
We're doing Car Bombs in the kitchen. Wanna come?
Noooo.
YES.
What are you?
What? Oh, White trash.
White trash?
Huh.
Celeste?
Yoga?
Yeah, I haven't seen you there for a while.
I've been running a lot. Keeps you in better shape.
I can see that's important to you. (referring to the Car Bomb in her FACE)
How's your practice? (waving her finger in his face, laughing)
White trash?
Uh huh. What are you?
Um, a cereal killer, obviously.
You're "punny."
By the way, you were right.
About what?
About me. All of it, the car, the phone, the yoga. Except that I did go to an Ivy League school. Cornell.
Barely an Ivy.
I know.
Do you smoke?
At parties.
Me too. Let's go.
Sorry about that day at the gym. I feel really open after yoga...
Shhhh. Don't say open. Your costume's great. Don't ruin it.
I'm kidding. I only go to yoga to meet girls. Speaking of, what's the deal with you and me? Is this happening? Or...
My husband of six years wants a divorce so he can marry the woman who's carrying his child. That's the deal with you and me.
I'm sorry, that sounds tough.
He's having a baby with a girl he barely knows. He's so lost. He's just going about it all...wrong.
And you're right. Now what?
What do you mean?
Well do you want to be right or do you want to be happy?
Listen, Yoga, I don't WANT to be right, I AM right. People will let you down. I've accepted that fact, but unfortunately, most of the time, knowing that does keep you from being happy. But at least it's real.
No one has ever given a more self- righteous monologue wearing only a trash bag. Except for maybe the homeless guy outside my dry cleaners.
Time to go, drunky.
Call me!
Hey, it's Celeste. You know, I still have a bunch of your stuff in the office. You should probably grab it at some point. Okay.
You're going to be a really good dad.
What? Why did you say that?
I don't know, I just know it.
No one's ever said that to me.
At least they recycle.
This is...so weird but I just realized...what's your middle name? I don't even know it.
It's um...Godelieve.
Goldleaf?
No, Goldelieve. It means loved by the Gods. It's Dutch.
Sweet. Mine's Mordechai.
What does it mean?
Means I'm really Jewish.
Guitar Hero?? That's quite an extravagant purchase for a freelance writer and his "elegant" Belgian bride.
Shit. Shit shit shit.
Ow!!! Shit!
Celeste?
Hey!
What...are you doing?
I just...
Um...came over to drop off some of your stuff.
But why were you in the trash can?
I lost something.
In the trash can?
My bracelet. It was a whole thing. It's over now.
You've met Veronica, right?
Yes! Hi! Wow, you're so pregnant, right! I love your sweater.
Oh. Thanks!  Are you bleeding?
What? Oh , yeah, I guess I am.
Let me get you something for that.
NO. No, don't. It's fine, just a little cut.
Are you sure? I'm so sorry about this.
No, I'm sorry. So sorry. Well, I'm late for things. Have a good afternight.
You sure you don't want to come in for a drink?
Nooooo, no. That's very nice but no. Great to see you guys! Okay.
Is that mine?
Waht? Oh, yeah, that's weird. I don't know how...here you go.
Hey. Celeste. It's Paul. The cereal killer? There's this yoga retreat in Tulum that I just got an e-mail about...uh, that's not why I'm really calling. I just like you. Call me back if you want to drink some cold beer with me. 310 864- 2120.
You told her you liked her sweater? What are you, twelve?
It was a disaster. But you should have seen the sweater. So great. Beth, am I losing my mind?
Maybe. No. Please no more trash- diving. Let's focus on you now.
This guys Paul keeps calling me but I don't know...
C, you never know. Just go out with him. It doesn't have to be perfect...
I met him at the gym. I'm not meeting my husband at the gym.
Just go. Nothing to lose.
So where do you live?
Uh, I live in Westwood. In a condo.
Cool.
You are gonna love this place. You've never felt so relaxed in your life.
Ahhhhh. Wow, this is a unique place to take a date.
Yeah, I take all my dates here.
I feel special.
You are. They all are.
So how is being right about everything going for you?
Not...that well. I've been on a real winning streak, so I thought I'd call you.
You know what? I'm happy you did.
AHHHH! I don't know what your definition of relaxing is but...
Just wait. Trust me, you need this right now.
Why would you take me to a place where Asian people beat you up? That was absolute torture.
But how do you feel?
I feel great, actually.
So shut up then.
Where are we going now?
Don't try to control me. You need to let go. In yoga, we call it vairyaga.
Oh my god, don't, with the yoga.
This place is...really cool.
You sound surprised.
I am, Westwood condo.
I'll get us beers.
Hey!
Ohh!!
What was that for?
Vairyaga, bro, let go. Not everything has to have a reason.
Oooh...toe touch basket toss coming up...degree of difficulty 9. Gnarly.......nailed it! Way to go, Becky!!!
What the fuck is a Baby Bjorn?
It's a very, very tiny Swedish man.
It's a baby carrier that allows your child to benefit from parental intimacy without the confinement of a stroller. Duh.
Why do you know that.
Beth. We go to a lot of baby showers.
I put a lot of babies in the ladies.
Birthing towels, breast pump, Diaper genie? Fuck, I'm definitely having a baby.  How's Celeste?
She's...oh-kay. I'm fine-tuning her cannibus levels right now, just trying to find the right balance.
Celeste doesn't smoke pot.
She does now. She loves it.
How's Veronica? She's so sweet.
Yeah, less sweet pregnant but it's probably just hormones.
But are you into it?
Yeah, I really like her. She seems great. For someone that I don't really know that's having my baby.
MY JAM!
Are you scared?
A little. Yes.
That's great. You should be. Just keep saying "yes." I'm really proud of you.
She's like my top client now.
Step out of the shadows and into the light. Are you crying?
I don't know what I'm doing. Dating is stupid and all of a sudden, my ex-husband bakes cakes? It's probably fucking gluten-free.
What?
Nothing. Can you just roll a joint please?
Day by day, C. You need not trip.
What are they like together?
Who? Jesse and Veronica?
Yeah.
You know, they're oh-kay. Jesse is trying. It's not all rainbows and unicorns but...
So he's not happy.
I didn't say that.
I really like the logo.
Oh, thank you. Yeah, I think it's perfect.
The I.M. Pei influence is pretty cool.
Wow, yeah, there is a little of that happening. I.M. Pei. Huh.
Are you mocking me?
No, I'm just impressed that you know anything about architecture.
Why, because I'm a pop star? You know what your thing is? Contempt prior to investigation.
I'm sorry?
You're convinced you're smarter than everyone and THAT is your dark little prison.
Are you...?? How dare you...
Dark little prison?? Bitch, what does she know. You know what's a dark little prison?? Having to wear midriffs for a living. What does she...
What the fuck.
I started smoking again.
I can see that. That must go well with your pilates.
I don't know what the rules are and I'm sure I'm breaking them but...god, I really miss you.
You want to come in?
Veronica is friends with the assistant gallerist there and he just really loved my stuff. I don't know, we'll see...
Jesse, that's great. I'm so happy for you.
Yeah, yeah. It's great.
I should probably get home.
Yeah. It's really nice to see you.
You should go.
Can we just...lay here for a bit?
I can't believe I'm having a baby...and it's not with you.
Yeah.
We have a massive problem on our hands. I need you in the office. Now.
I don't see anything.
It's a penis. And a butt.
What? Really? I don't see it.
You can't be serious. (points to the logo) There's the penis. And there's the penis going into the butt.
I think it's a stretch.
Well, it's not a stretch, Celeste.
...teenagers were hoping to get a little bit of the teen star's fashion magic but instead, they have been suprised by what they saw.
There's homosexual butt sex in the logo. Does Riley think we're that stupid?? I will never support gay marriage.
Neither Riley nor a representative from Pop Form-the marketing company responsible-could be reached for comment.
Celeste, what did you do. How could be so careless?
Oh. Oh my God. Oh wow, I totally see it now. WOW. Ha. Haha. Hahahahaaha.
It's a cock in a butt!!! Hahahaahaaa!!
Stop it. Stop laughing.
Scott, come on...
No, this is not a joke. Our company's in serious danger.
You're being dramatic.
Get out. I can't, with you, right now. I have to deal with this. I'll call you soon.
No...okay.
Hey.
Hey.
We gotta talk.
I know. That's why I called.
Celeste...
Wait, let me say something. I don't know what happened last night. I don't know what's happening with your other situation. But I need to say this. For the record, I fucked up. I was cavalier about you. I took us for granted. And I know this may sound crazy but I'd be remiss if I didn't...if you were open to it...I think that I could do better. With you. With us. If there's a chance still...I'd like to know.
Jesse?
I'm sorry. I can't.
Hey!
Why did you come to my house last night?
I don't know.
Oh no, I think you do.
I made a mistake.
And?
I shouldn't have come.
You're a fucking coward.
I'm just trying to do the right thing with Veronica. I'm trying to change.
Well, you never changed for me.
To be honest, you didn't really let me.
Wow. All I did was wait for you to grow up! I rooted for you, I fucking paid for everything, I did everything for you!
Yeah, and I was never your equal. And you know what? I think you preferred it that way.
Right. Well, I know my success was never easy for you.
And how do you define success, Celeste? Because you don't look very successful right now.
And you are? Pretending to be a father? Pretending to be an adult?
What do you want?
I just want you to admit that you're wrong!
Wrong? Wrong about what? What did you want me to do? Wait for you to meet someone first? Is that how you saw it happening?
I didn't expect to meet someone so fast, but I did. And I think we have a chance to be happy together. I don't want to blow that.
You know what, Jesse? You definitely will blow it.
I feel really sorry for you. You might be alone forever.
Don't ever call me.
Don't worry about it.
She's so sad.
Is she? I don't think so.
No, she's sad. I can tell. I went to dance camp.
That's the first good thing that's happened to me in months.
Shit'll get better.
Will it? You don't know that.
How could he do this to me?
J-Thunder? He's not doing anything to you. You wanted a divorce.
But I didn't want it like this.
When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.
Huh?
Oh. It's Victor Frankl.
Huh.
I gotta go before Petco closes.
You have a pet?
No, but I gotta get a toy for this girl's cat, you know, so she'll give up the kitty.
Can I come?
No.
Will you bring me some Panda Express?
No.
Do you think the Obamas are really in love?
Yes. Enough questions. I'll pick you up at noon.
Noon?
Beth and Tucker's pre-wedding BBQ?
Right, right.
Hey, easy on the herb until then. That shit is powerful.
Hi honey, you remember Eileen from...
Do you have any more of that ranch dressing? It's the fucking booooooomb.
Hi Carol! Beth's getting married! I was married, remember? These guys are in for a fucking dogfight, right?
Let's get you a soda.
Do you guys have any tequila?
We only have Mimosas and Shandys.
I'll have both please.
I'm going to recommend some quiet time for you right now.
Can I smoke?
No.
I don't want to be alone forever.
Not forever, honey. Just until you sober up. You'll be fine.
Okay then, I'll just go to the other side of the pool. I promise I won't make you look bad.
At least she's quiet now.
I'm gonna get her out of here.
Hey Riley, it's Celeste. I just want to talk to you about this "error" in your logo. I'm so, so sorry, I will fix this...call me.
I just think it's corny to wear white two nights in a row. I want to rock a pattern, or maybe something in pastel...
How's this? C! Wake up! I'm leaving in an hour and I have to make a decision now. You owe me. You humped my grandmother yesterday.
Oh no, are you okay?
What the fuck does Riley Banks know.
Um...nothing. She's a tart.
Yeah dude! She's fucking moderately talented, blessed with a good face and has maybe 5 more years left of stardom. Who is she to tell ME what...
I never hung up, I never hung up! Fuck! Do you think she...
Hey Riley, what's up?
I need to talk to you. Come to my house. Now.
Oh boy.
The thing is, I have been having a really hard time in my life, everything is sort of falling apart and when you said that thing about contempt and investigation, it just sort of hit a nerve and...
Just, shut up for a minute.
I just found out my boyfriend cheated on me.
Oh. God, I'm sorry. I didn't even know you had a boyfriend.
Nobody knew. He didn't want anybody to know. Fucking ass hole. And now, my career might be over because you put a penis in my logo. Thank you for that.
I didn't know who to call.
So you called the smartest person you know.
Are you crying?
Oh, yeah, this just reminds me of someone.
A guy?
Yeah. A guy.
You miss him?
Yeah, I do.
They all fucking suck.
Kind of.
So it never gets better?
No, it doesn't. But you do. You're gonna be fine.
Hi...I know I won't...no I'm on the road already! Near...Bakersfield? Of course I'll be there...love you too.
I'm so sorry but I am the maid of honor and I am supposed to be at the wedding real far away, would you mind if I just got in front of you?...
Thank you so much, I really do appreciate...sir?
I'm incredibly late for this wedding and my dress is here, is there any way...
Hi. I'm sure you heard me ask the last guy but...
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
She pursued her love of Spanish men, but missed her Tucker, more than just as a friend.
And our princess returned home to her loving prince, and they've been together ever since.
And now we're gonna hear from Celeste, Beth's best friend in the world.
Thank you. Thanks a lot, girls, that was so...wow. There are no words. Well, this is gonna sound bad but I actually forgot that I was speaking tonight.
I don't where to start. Um...how do you get a nun pregnant? You fuck her?
Thanks, Tom. Man, it was much longer than I thought to get to Big Sur from Los Angeles on a Friday afternoon. Stellar call on having a destination wedding the weekend before 4th of July. Busiest travel day of the year. So thanks for that, Mrs. Weinberg.
But the truth is, I would go anywhere for Beth. She's my best friend. And I'm so happy for her. Senior year of college, we had a tradition. Every Sunday, come rain or shine, Beth and Tucker would meet me and Jesse at the Bishop with a 12-pack of Miller High Life, the champagne of beers, and we would meet to talk about what was important in the world, you know, Heidegger's influence on hip-hop. Or the feminist duality on "Melrose Place." Life's big questions. Beth and Tucker were just friends then but there was always something there. Just an ease they had with each other. Jesse and I spent years trying to get them together, unsuccessfully. 
But we all remained friends and watched as Tucker dated the most slutty, vacuous and vile girls on the planet. For five long years.
Finally, he removed his head from his ass, and saw what was in front of him. And that was beautiful Beth. And none of us could be happier about it; they were perfect. At last. Love wins.
Um...Jesse and I are getting a divorce. So that's...yeah, our timing was not as good, I guess. Beth and Tucker, you are lucky to be best friends. Work hard and respect that. It doesn't come easily. Be patient, don't always think you're right. And if you are, it doesn't fucking matter anyway. Fight for it, everyday, I wish I had.
I know this may not the best time to talk about this...but...at some point, we will have to talk about Tucker's dance moves.
He is so special. Not as special as that poem. That those girls did?
Wow. Wow.
Your speech was really...beautiful. Thank you.
I meant it.
I know.
You know what else is beautiful?
Oh god, tug it.
Aw yeah! Fuck!
Jesse?
Hey.
What are you doing?
What? Nothing. We're just...
Oh, Jesse and I do this thing where we find the littlest thing that resembles a penis and we just, you know...
I don't get it.
It's stupid.
Oh, the foods out.  See you on the dance floor? Watch out for Tucker though.
So, that's 38 points plus 50 bonus points for using all my tiles so...
Wait, wait, wait. I think I may have to challenge. Zooecia?? That's not a word, that's my hoochie cousin's name!
Are you challenging or not?
Yes, I definitely am.
Well, I will tell you that Zooecia is a sac secreted by a compound organism but here you go. (he hands her the Scrabble dictionary) Look for yourself.
Ha ha! I go again.
I've never lost a game of Scrabble in my life.
Well, nothing lasts forever.
I'm so sorry I beat you in Scrabble.
No you're not.
You're right, I'm not.
Will you get a condom?
Uh...I don't think we should...
No, you're using a condom.
No, I don't think we should sleep together.
What?
I just...I don't know.
Are you not into it?
No, no believe me, I'm into it.
Then, what's the deal?
I really like you.
Right, I'm confused...why not sleep with me then?
Because I think I might really like you.
Oh.  Oh. Okay. Well, I like you too.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE MOST EMBARRASSING SPEECH EVER! HOW WILL SHOW YOUR FACE TO YOUR FRIENDS EVER AGAIN?
ACTUALLY, WEIRDLY, I'M KINDA HAPPY I DID IT. I FEEL BETTER SOMEHOW.
WELL GOOD FOR YOU THEN.
THE GAYS REALLY KNOW HOW TO PARTY, HUH?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THIS IS A GAY CLUB.
IT'S OPENING NIGHT HERE. IT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT IS YET.
RILEY, THE CLUB IS CALLED SWALLOW.
Excuse me, can you please tell your friend Riley that we worship her??
Sure...
Wait, are you aware that the logo is...
It's amazing. All of our friends are rocking it. It's like the gay Izod.
Wow, so, what, you just buy the biggest size they make?
How dare you, I'm a size 10 in tween. I have a slight frame.
I LOVE IT HERE!!
Tweens don't want her anymore. But the gays do! Ten percent of Americans are gay, Scott. You're gay, start thinking gay. Gay Izod. She could be Lady Gaga by the end of the year. Huge market.
Wow, you might have just turned the cock in the butt around.
We WILL make the cock in the butt work for us. The cock in the butt will be huge!
So, it comes with directions and it's actually really easy to assemble.
Look, you do not know me. I do not want to assemble. Trust me, you do not want me to assemble. Bad things happen. Could I just take the floor model? I'll hook you up.
Lemme go ask my manager.
Thanks, dude.
Veronica? Hey, Celeste.
Of course, yeah, hi! What are you doing?
Oh, I'm getting a dresser. You?
Oh, you know getting...
Baby stuff. Baby stuff.
Beth is uh...throwing me a baby shower? So I have to register.
She is?
That's uh...really nice.
Very. And so helpful right now.
Of course.  Well, looks like you're really organized.
Organized, terrified.
You'll do great.
Thanks. I hope so.
Listen, I never got a chance to just tell you I'm so sorry about all this. Trust me, I didn't expect...
No, don't. Really. There's nothing to apologize for. I'm the one who's sorry. I mean, I dug through your trash.
Look, I don't blame you. For anything. This has all been so weird. Everything happened really fast.
Yeah, it did. But everything will work out. I know it. Jesse's book is coming out...
He's so talented.
Yeah, he is.
Well, good luck. Nice to see you.
You too.
Oh sorry!
Oh, it's okay! Bye again.
Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be...oh God give me a reason, I'm down on bended knee..ooohohhh ooooh
Ooohh ohhh. Til you come back to me..
I'm down on bended knee hee hee hee.
I think we're really good.
No, we ARE really good.
Aw shit!
Get ready. You're first.
Baby when I met you, there was peace on earth, I set out get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside. Soft inside? What the fuck?
Shhh come on. Focus.
You do something to me, that I can't explain, hold me closer, and I feel no pain. Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication.
Honest love, we feel, needs Honest love, we feel, needs conversation. And we ride it conversation. And we ride it it together, uh huh... it together, uh huh...
I can't.
What? Come on, we're so good together. Islands in the stream, that is what we are. Get in there!! This is my favorite part!
No. I can't.
I know I'm pitchy but I'm finding it. Sail away with me...
No. This. Us. I'm sorry.
What do you mean?
I just...can't.
Are you serious? Oh no. Why?
I think I need to be alone? I'm not ready. I'm having fun and I feel like I'm beginning to like you and I just don't think I'm ready for that.
What? Really?
Wow, you're breaking my heart.
I'm so sorry. You are so...great. But I'm getting divorced.
Celeste, I know.
I think I need to go through this alone.
Yeah. Yeah, okay. I respect that. Live by will, not by force.
What?
You're only ready when you're ready, you know? Don't force it. It's just some yoga shit.
Thanks.
But I do like you. I like you a lot. And when you are ready, if you're ready, call me.
Sign here. And here. And here.
And here. Here. Yup. Aaaaaand here. Here. Couple more. Here...
I like that tie.
Oh, thank you.
One more here.
Is it made out of organic mung beans?
No, I actually found it digging through your trash.
Ohhh, I see. All right.
So...we're divorced!
We did it.
You wanna walk for a couple minutes?
Sure.
These are beautiful.
I thought you hated them.
Yeah, well, I've never seen them at night.
What's up with you? I know we just got divorced but no one died, right?
I'm just feeling like maybe you were right. I am a fuck up. I don't know what I'm doing. My girlfriend left.
What? Veronica? Left where?
Left me. She wanted me to tell her everything was gonna be okay and I couldn't. I don't know why but I just...couldn't. She wants to go back to Brussels.
Okay, you can say it now. You were right, I blew it. Just say it.
Hey...don't do that.
Do what?
You are not a loser. You never were. You took a chance. I admire that and I believe in you.
You do?
I do. And I want to thank you.
For what?
For never being the person I wanted you to be.
Oh, you're welcome.
Go get her.
But I don't know if everything is gonna be all right.
Well, who does? Do you love her?
I do.
Then it's worth fighting for.
Okay. Okay.
God, I finally understand why you fucking cry all the time. Shit is emotional.
You deserve to be happy. And I wish that for you, always.
Me too.
So...I guess we were right.
Huh?
I love you.
I love you too.
Hey. So, you're probably giving your card to some girl in yoga right now. But if that doesn't work out for you...I think I may be ready. To beat you in Scrabble.
Excuse me, sir?
Nothing.
Hey, I'm sorry for cutting. My dog's in the car and he's really thirsty. So, thanks.
No problem.
