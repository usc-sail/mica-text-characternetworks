Strike three!
Check out Sugar... Puts on twenty pounds in two months; now he's going for twenty more.
 All muscle, baby. Rock solid.
Slow down, kid, it ain't going nowhere.
 If you hustled half as much as him, maybe you'd be hungry too.
Fly ball.
Fly ball.
Line drive.
Line drive.
Ground ball.
Ground ball.
Home run!
Hone rone!
What'd you tell him?
I told him to grip the ball more gently. Like a tit.
Pedro Berroa. Third year.     Hasn't developed like we hoped.
How much he sign for?
Forty-five.
Jesus. These kids keep getting more expensive. How much did you sign for back in the day?
3000.   When I was fifteen.
Salvador Torres. Been practicing with the team for almost a week. Still raw, but he's got a lot of potential.
We gonna sign him?
Soon. Soon. We want to play it low- key, see what his agent says.
How much you think?
They've gotten two offers from other clubs. Agent says they were around a hundred.
 He's good.
What about him?
Miguel Santos. Great arm. We signed him two years ago for fifteen.
Good deal.    He throw any junk?
 Sugar!
Show us your curve.
Not bad.   Mind if I try something?
Hey, kid, do you mind?   May I?
 Give him the ball.
Spike curve. Gives you more rotation, more movement.  You try.
Vamos!   Let's go! Pitch it!
It's okay, son, these things take time. You'll figure it out.
I want to talk to you.
I want talk to you.
Your performance in the mound is not as good as last year. What is the problem?
Your performance in the mound is not good as last year. What is problem?
I don't know. Maybe my mechanic.
I don't know. Maybe mechanic.
I want to give you a chance.   It is up to you...
I want to give you a chance.   Is up to you...
How are you, sis?
Any news about the States?
Is that all you have to say?
Hello, Abuela. You're looking beautiful.
What's up my people?   How's the TV?
Erica won't let me watch baseball.
Not during American Idol, anyway.
Buenas, Miguelito! Do you have any good news for your mother?
As a matter of fact, yes.
You're going to the United States?!
Not yet, ma... But I learned how to throw a knuckle curve.
A knuckle curve? What's that?
Sugar, come out and play!
When will you finish this?
Soon.   It's just hard to find the time.
It's pretty.
I'm trying to match the chairs my dad made, but I can't get it right.
Well, I think it's perfect.
I'll make you another when I'm done.
And the rest of the house?   How long till it's done?
Um, another month, maybe two... You know we just did it where Abuela's room is going to be...
 Don't tell me that!
Why not? We can do it in mom's kitchen next. Right over there.
 I hope you make it to the States this year.
You hope? C'mon, there's nobody better, baby.
 Okay, how about: I KNOW you'll make it.
Now you're talkin'. And when I do, I'll buy a Cadillac, drive it through the ocean, and bring you back with me.
You can't drive a Cadillac on water.
Yes! In the States they make cars that drive on water.
You're crazy.
You'll see who's crazy.   Just watch.
I want to see the snow.   Does it snow in Kansas City?
I don't know. But I'll take you to New York City. Yankee Stadium. It snows there. You wanta see me play in Yankee Stadium?
It doesn't snow during baseball season, silly.
So we'll go for Christmas.
Promise?
Next Christmas, we'll sail into Yankee Stadium in my Cadillac car-boat. Deal?
You are crazy!
 I liked her, but she asked me to cut my hair. I thought about it. She was cute, but... I liked my hair more.
I liked it too, Javi.
Then why'd you cut it last week?
I thought it was time for a new look.
Or a new girl.
Watch it, baby, that's a million-dollar arm you're messing with.
He's right!    All hail the golden arm.
You call that flabby rubberband an arm?
Oooh...
This flabby rubberband can throw 95. What can yours do?
I threw 98 in double-A Portland.
98? Then why you washing windshields now? I saw you try and bumrush Javy at the stoplight last week.
Various Sunday morning images establishing Miguel's hometown:
You're supposed to aim for the head!
I like this one. Good bat speed. Only twelve years old, out here four, five hours everyday. His mom tells me he's missing school. I say, yeah, but... have you seen his swing?
I'm showing his older brother to the Yankees on Monday.
 They don't know what they missed with you. It's cool though. They'll be knocking on your door, offering millions when you turn into a superstar. You'll see...
Have you been to New York?
 Nothing like playing for a crowd of New Yorkers. They're even louder than Dominicans.
What's the city like?
It's great. But you need to get to Kansas City before you start thinking about New York. Know what I mean?
You hear anything about spring training yet?
Yep.
And?
Miguel, Luis! Dinner is ready!
You'd tell me if you knew.
Maybe.
Wanna join us for dinner?
Not tonight. But give your mom a kiss for me, okay?
C'mon, Nelson! Fire it in, baby!
A lot of you are thinking about your families right now. Your girlfriends, sisters and brothers, grandparents. You're feeling the pressure. But, I'm going to tell you something very important, gentlemen... forget it. You've got to think about yourselves. Put all your energy into your game, into your development as a player. Forget about everything else in your life... and just play ball. You wanna succeed, you gotta be like a racehorse, focused on your goal. It's up to you.
Next up, Miguel! Here we go!
Berroa, see Alvarez when you're dressed.
So the Dominican's like, `Fuck, what am I gonna do?' He stays there, points up to the sky and says. `Look! There's a plane... Right THERE!'
Hey, Sugar!    They made me an offer.
Good for you. Congratulations.     How much they offer you?
 115,000. (sensing the other players surprise) But, you know, my manager's taking, like, forty of it... What'd you sign for?
Oh, you know, more or less the same. Did you get any other offers?
Yankees and Seattle, but not as much.
Just don't get cocky. No one likes a dickhead... Welcome to the team.
So, why do they call you Sugar?
Well it's like this... it started cause I'm sweet with the ladies. But mostly it's cause I got the sweetest knuckle curve in the whole Republic.
 Bullshit! You just learned that shit on Friday! It's cause he eats so much junk food!
 He's just jealous.
We got you a going away present.
You should try Los Campos. I heard the Dodgers could use a new first baseman.
Fuck that. The coaches are even tougher over there. I'm done, man. 
No more curfews, nobody tellin' me what to do and how to do it. For real, I'm glad this shit's over. I'm a free man.
 No caps indoors, son!
Cut the meat with your knife; eat the meat with your fork. NEVER eat the meat with your knife.
Or you'll chop off your tongue.
Ten p.m. lights out!
 "Tay me outta the ball game, tay me outta the crowd..."
"...buys me so peanut and crackay- yacks. I doe-care if I never get back. Roo, roo, roo for home teams, we doe- win is a shame..."
Santos, what the hell's wrong with you?
I think I have the flu, coach.    I can't pitch today.
You've got five minutes to get out on that mound, Santos.
Feel better now? Let's go!
Strike!
Wipe that smile off your face.
I am very disappointed. Just when I was starting to like you guys, you go and do something stupid. What do you have to say for yourselves?
But Alfonso was there too--
--No excuses. This is unacceptable behavior. You guys need to learn discipline.
You need to remember that you still have a long way to go, a lot of hard work ahead of you before you make it. First, there's getting your shot in the American Minor Leagues: rookie ball, single, double, triple A - all that before you even set foot in a major league ballpark. So, you better pull it together quick...
Because nobody's gonna take this shit from a couple Dominican rookies when you go to the U.S. for Spring Training this season.
You've been invited to Spring Training.
Phone call.    He said it's important.
Hello?
Don't forget to call everyday.    I want to know everything!
Everything?
You know what I mean, dummy.
Of course I'll be calling to keep you in check, make sure your grades don't slip.
Look who's talking.
You are my hero!
It was your father's.     I want you to take it with you...
You've been   given a wonderful gift, Miguelito.    And God willing, you will continue to   do great things with it. I love you so   much.
Miguelito! You gonna remember your uncle Angel when you're all big and famous? Don't forget your family, kid. Never forget where you came from.
Lupe! Cousin Lupe! Remember that time we went skinny-dipping at the Malecn?
When?
You were eight years old! Hated the goats so much. You would cry and cry and cry and cry. What a baby you were. Do you remember?
What's your name?
Lola!   Your aunt Lola!
Uncle Jeffe!
Your neighbor Ana. I grew up around the corner from here.
Don't give me any shit, kid.      I taught you everything you know.
I'm damn proud of you, kid.    Your father would be, too.
Thanks.    I owe it all to you.
Not all.   Just forty percent.
I spent the best years of my life playing in the States. Life gives you a lot of opportunities, but baseball only gives you one. Enjoy every minute of it.
How's your new curve?
It's pretty sweet.
Good.   Here...
What's this for?
Your autograph.
I'm kidding, you arrogant prick. It's so you can write your family... and me, too... if you feel like it.
Where's your boyfriend?
Which one?
I don't know; the ugly one.
Hector?
Okay, where's Hector?
 Some other party.
So what about the good-looking one?
Mmm, Fernando... I think he's out there dancing with Sofia.
I'm proud of you, sis. You're going to do great things too. We all know it.
I'm gonna miss you...
C'mon, let's dance.
Go on, I'll be out in a minute. And tell Fernando to keep his dirty hands off my girl.
Check this out.
To America!
To America!
What's up fellas!?
Jorge!
Never, never, never, drink from the hotel mini bar. That shit is expensive. You want beer, buy it at the store. You wanta see titties? They got magazines for that. Don't pay in the hotel.
You boys ready?
The greatest thing about the States? You can order breakfast 24/7. French toast is the best. It's nothing like Dominican toast.  French toast please.
Who's next?
French toast.
Brad Johnson. He just signed for a million dollars out of college.
There's a lot of guys like that. But you can't let that intimidate you. Everyone knows Dominicans rule the game.
What's this about Dominicans ruling the game?
No, he must've said Venezuelans.
Sammy, Manny, Pedro...
Santana, Zambrano, the Guillens!
Are you guys all from the same family?
Look who's talking... Are these your brothers?
What, all Dominicans look the same, now?
This is Miguel and Marcos. Up from Boca Chica.  
Orlando and Ed. We all played in Bridgetown together before I moved up to Double A and left these fools behind.
But you couldn't hang in Wichita.
I injured my knee, asshole.    But I'm healthy now. You'll see.
Fifty bucks you're back in Iowa next month.
Fifty bucks you're still an asshole next month.
You've gotta show us your best game here. Remember that, until you reach the top, there's always guys above you, hustling to keep you here. And guys below you pushing to take your job. We have 75 pitchers in this camp competing for less than 50 positions come April 3rd. So you gotta work hard...
Bring over Leonard.
Bring over Leonard!
Welcome to America, kid.
I have to admit... I'm getting a little sick of the french toast.
I pitched against Rob Leonard today.
No shit!   You strike him out?
Yeah.
Liar!
You don't believe me?
No.
Well, I got one strike at least.
So, do you like it there?
Mmmm...    It's different.
Different how?
I don't know. Just different.     Like the food is really sweet.
I thought you liked sweet things.
All the players are really good.
But not like you.
No, not like me. Of course not... But they're pretty good.
I miss you.
I miss you, too.
 Turn it off.
Just relax. Know your pitches. And take it easy. Ground ball. Okay?
 Just relax. Ground ball.
Strike!
Two!
Where did you learn English so good?
Back home in Caracas.
Like in high school, or something?
Yeah, but it's still hard though. People talk fast.
C'mon.    Let's grab some dinner.
Nah, I'm gonna stay and work out a little. I'll catch up later.
 Good catch.
Thanks... I got lucky.
French toast, right?
No...   Egg.    Egg, please.
Eggs. No problem. How would you like'm?
Yes.
Um, okay, uh... Scrambled?       Over easy? Sunny side up?
 French toast.
No eggs?   You sure?
French toast.
 Alright, honey. French toast it is.
Okay... This is scrambled.       Scrambled.
Scrambled.
 Over easy.
Over easy.
 This one's tricky... Sunny-side-up. Sunny...
Sunny...
Side...
Side...
Up...
Up.
Sunny side up... On the house.
Thank you.
 You're welcome.
They're sending Antonio back.
Shit.   What about you guys?
We're staying here.   Rookie ball.
Go take a look.
I'm not with you guys?
Straight to Single A, bro.     With Jorge. Congratulations.
Where is Iowa?
Can't I stay with you guys?
Don't worry, Sugar. The Higgins are good people. I stayed with them last time I played here.
Then why don't you stay with them again?
They have a no girls policy.
Jorge! Good to see you back in Bridgetown!
Thank you.   This is Miguel.
I go now.    Take care of my friend.
We've had Dominicans, Venezuelan boys, a Colombian, one from Panama, blacks and some Americans. Mostly Spanish boys, though. Johan Santana, Mendy Lopez and Ramon Martinez all stayed with us. Years ago.
Last year we had this boy, Junior Sanchez. Nice boy. Decent with the glove, but couldn't bunt to save his life.
Two-for-twelve in sacrifice situations.
Cost the team at least two victories.
Oh, that's being generous!   I'd say four or five.
Put your things down.   I'll show you around.
This is the kitchen. Help yourself to whatever you'd like. You can make a list of special foods you like to eat and put it here.
Oh, and over here, this drawer is a little funny.
You have to be careful or...
This is the washer and the dryer. For your clothes. You put the soap in this one. Sopa.
The other one's just hot air. Caliente.
Your room is up here.
 El banyo.
Your new cuarto. Bedroom. Do with it as you please. Just no girls. Chicas? No chicas.
No drinking. No cervezas in the casa. No chicas in the bedroom.
I already told him that one.
Okay.     What about quiet time?
Right. There's no real curfew, but you must be quiet after ten.
Diez. (holding index finger to mouth) Shhhh... after diez.
Ten.     Okay.
Si! That's all we ask. It's our job to keep you healthy and focused on baseball.
And we take pride in that.
Thank you.
Everyone is so proud, Miguelito.   It's all we can talk about.
Did you get the money?
Of course.
Good. And Victor? Can he start construction on the house again? I'll be sending money every two weeks now.
We just paid him. He's coming next week.
What about you? You get something for yourself like I said?
Me?   What do I need?
C'mon, mom...
What?
You didn't get anything?
Well, maybe I got some new shoes, but I'm not telling.
Three pairs, Miguel!    But who's counting?
Good for you, mom.
Miguel!   Time for dinner!
I have to go, mom. The lady is calling me. Smells like dinner.
Dinner? Don't forget who your real mother is, Miguelito. Are you going to prefer her cooking to mine now?
Impossible... I love you, mom.
Everyone loves and misses you.      Strike one out for me, okay?
Dear Lord... Thank you for the meal we are about to eat. And for blessing us with our new guest. And guiding him safely on his journey from the Dominican Republic to Bridgetown...
...And finally, Lord... Please look kindly over the Swing this season. May all the players stay healthy and... well, why not?... if there's anything you can do to help us win another championship, we'll take that too... Amen.
So, Miguel... Do - you - eat - meatloaf - back home?
I already told you, Michael, he doesn't speak any English.
I know but... I'm curious to know what he thinks of the meatloaf.
What do you care?   You didn't cook it.
 I doubt they have meatloaf in the Dominican Republic, dear.
I bet they have something similar. They probably just have another name for it.
This is good old-fashioned American home cooking, Miguel. Welcome to America.
I like.   Thank you.
Well, very good, Miguel. De nada to you, mi amigo. De nada to you.
If you guys ever need tickets for family or friends, just let me know two days ahead of time. Thursday's opener is already sold out, but I saved one row, so you need to speak up now...
Santos - you're over there.
 Que pasa, hermano?
 What up, Flaco?
Dude, I was totally psyched when I saw your name on the squad. Good times.
Yeah, okay.
C'mon, bro, let's find you a suit.
I can't afford a suit.
I didn't say buy a suit. I said find a suit. So when you make it big, you'll already know what looks good.
Hot damn!   That's what's up!
You like it?
I love it!   You look like an all-star, bro.
 "Starting pitcher for American League... from Kansas City... Miguel... 'Sugar'... Santos."
What about you, man?   You try one.
Me?   Nah... I'm all washed up.
C'mon...
Very nice.
Dude. You have no idea. Just wait till we go to Big Muddy's.
Big Muddy's?
You gotta be 21 to drink there. This is my old license. They won't know the difference.
Are you kidding me? Nobody's gonna believe I'm this ugly fool.
Believe me; they won't know the difference.
Hey there, Swing fans, welcome to another exciting season of Swing baseball. As always we've got some new faces who we'll get to know this year-- like Brad Johnson, the highly touted 2nd baseman out of Stanford. He'll make his professional debut tonight. Great night for Swing baseball... And also a great night to grab a bite and a brew at Harlow's after the game - your local pub and proud sponsor...
You think they know how to salsa?
 Go for it, bro. But remember, just cause they dance with you, doesn't mean they want anything else.
Not from you, anyway.
Yo flaco!
What's up fellas?     Good game.
What's with the flaco? I mean...  You call this flaco?
You ready?
Let's do it.
 Careful, Paco. This ain't the jungle.
How'd you like the service?  Our church? Hope it wasn't too boring for you. Did you go to church in the Dominican Republic?
I am sorry.    I do not understand.
S'okay. You understand more than a lot of folks around here I bet.
So listen, me and some friends   are hanging out later. You should    stop by my house after the game. It's    gonna be super chill. Grandma can take    you there, but here...
Can I borrow a pen real quick?
After the game. My house...     Good luck, tonight.
Santos, apparently feeling the butterflies on his first professional outing. Hailing all the way from the Dominican Republic, Santos wowed the club with his power during Spring Training. But he's off to a rocky start tonight.
Relax, Sugar. It's the same game we played back home. That's all it is. Just a game, man. So relax. Let's have some fun. Okay?
See?   Just like home.
Strike!
That's it!   There it is!
Nearly unhittable for the first 6 innings, that was only the second hit allowed by Santos tonight.
Good game, kid.   Enjoy this...
 Nice work, Sugar.
 But that wasn't my fault. I can go longer.
 Take it easy; it's your first game.
You hear that? It's for you, kid.
Hey Miguel.    C'mon inside.
 My first... strike-out.
Oh, Miguel... you're so sweet. Congratulations, I heard you pitched awesome.
Hey everybody, this is Miguel. He's from the Dominican Republic, and now he pitches for the Swing.
What's up, man?
Wanna play?
No.   Thank you.
It's like soccer. You play soccer?
Soccer?   No. Baseball.
Well this is called fooze-ball.   Fooze- ball.
Foos-ball?
Yeah, you got it.
I used to be a pitcher. In little league. I wasn't very good though.
I heard that the beaches in the Dominican Republic are really beautiful.
Hey guys, let's get started.   Everyone grab a seat.
I'm so glad you all came. Last year, we didn't have half as many people in our group. So, I think this just goes to show the great work we've been doing in spreading the word. But this year, I want us to work harder. Now, I know a lot of you are studying for SATs or working on college applications. And all of that is important, but we need to remember that our spiritual accomplishments are more important. What we do in school or for a job... that's just a small part of who we are. We're only here by the grace of God, so let's get out there and share that grace.
 One there is above all others, Oh, how He loves! His is love beyond a brother's, Oh, how He loves! Earthly friends may fail or leave us, One day soothe, the next day grieve us; But this Friend will ne'er deceive us: Oh, how He loves!
Mamaema.    Very bad.   Very bad word.
Mama-ema?    What's it mean?
Mmm... Like--
Cocksucker?
Cock-sucker?
Yeah, we say cocksucker.
Okay, cocksucker.
Mamaema.
 Who is your favorite player?
 Robinson Cano for the Yankees.    I know him brother. And you?
Roberto Clemente.
Who is that?
What?    You don't know about Clemente?
Is Dominican?
Puerto Rican. I can't believe it. This is tragic. Do you know who Babe Ruth is?
Baby Ruth?   El chocolate?
Hey, how'd it go with that girl the other night?
Girl?
Yeah, didn't you have a date, or something?
Oh, she no es my girl.
No sweat, bro. We'll find you a little honey on the road.
You like The White Stripes?
I don't know.
Check it out.
"Santos stings Owls with 8 Ks." What kind of shoddy journalism is this? There's nothing' about me in here.
At what point in the game did you realize you had your best stuff?
 When did you know you were going to be a good pitcher in this game?
I knew from the time I was very young I would be a good pitcher. Ten, eleven years old. Thanks to God, I have had the opportunity to develop my talents.
 He knew very early that he was going to pitch good. Eleven years.
It's not good. Because I haven't been playing good... No. I'm working hard, but, I don't know... I think they might... (Jorge glances back toward Miguel) Listen, I can't talk now.
Did you ever see "Y Tu Mama Tambien"?
Y tu mama what?
Y Tu Mama Tambien... It's Mexican.
No, I don't know this.
What are your favorite movies?
Terminator.
I like Matrisse.
Oh, Matrisse. Very strong.
Matrisse?   What's that?
He doesn't know Matrisse?
You don't know The Matrisse?
The Mattress? I don't know. (turns to Jeff, beside him) Dude, do you know a movie called The Mattress?
The Mattress?
With Keanu...?
Keanu Reeves?
Oh, shit!   The MATRIX!!
Matrisse!
Yeah, yeah, the Matrix is badass.   I was like, Mattress? What?
Nice play, kid.     How's your foot?
You okay?
Take it easy. Don't force it.     How's it feel?
 Don't push it. Does it hurt?
I'm okay.
Let him toss a few warm-ups.
All right, kid.     Give it a rest.
I am okay.   Please.
You're okay, I know, but let's just be sure... Give me the ball, son.
You've been pitching so well... it's a real shame.
Don't worry, Miguel, you'll bounce right back.
Where'd you say you were from, Brad?
Berkeley.
Oh, different world out there, huh? You like to surf?
Uh, no, I've never tried it.     But maybe someday.
Your parents visit here?
Yeah, I hope so. Maybe when they get some time off this summer.
How about you, Miguel?    What's your family like?
My family?
Yeah.   Like, who do you live with back home?
I live with my mother, sister, brother... and Abuela?
Grandmother.
And grandmother.
How about your father, Miguel?
My father, uh...  He die.
Oh, Miguel, honey.    I'm so sorry.
 You have other child...?
Yes, we have a son.   Anne's older brother.
He's in Iraq.
You like it here in Iowa?
Yes.  I like... Many new things.  Very different.
I bet. You've traveled a long way, huh? God must have something special in mind for you...
What happened there?
 Uh... When I boy... Um... I don't know--
Tell me in Spanish.
 Okay... When I was little, I wanted to eat some cherries from a tree. It wasn't our tree, and there was a fence to keep us kids away.
So I climbed up the fence to knock down some cherries with a stick, but I when I took my first swing-- whoosh. I fell. There was a lot of blood.
Sorry, I just...      Sorry.
I should help clean up...
We have another meeting Thursday...    If you can come.
I had a good run.
What happened?
It's over.
Why?
You know the drill. I'm not playing well, so they'll bring up somebody who is.
What about your knee? You just need some more time... You're recovering.
Sugar...
When do you leave?
They want me to fly back tonight.
Tonight?!
But I'm not going back...
I gotta cousin in New York.
You're going to New York?
Where else? There's no work back home. My bonus won't last forever...
Relax Sugar, I'll see you at Yankee Stadium someday... when the Knights come to town. I'll be in the front row, getting drunk, and cheering the loudest.
Not for you though. Yankee fans are crazy. I can't take the risk... I'll call you.
You worry too much, Sugar. I'll be okay. I mean, it's just a game, right?
How'd you play tonight?
 Good, good.
I bet you have lots of groupies waiting for you after your games.
I have a few.
A few?
Just kidding. I mean I would, but none of these white girls speak Spanish. Marcos plays in Arizona. Lots of Mexicans; everyone speaks Spanish. He has like fifteen girlfriends.
Shut up!
He's probably lying though.
I bet he's lying.
Jorge went to New York.
To the Yankees?
No. Our team cut him loose. He's got a cousin there... I don't know what he's going to do...
Shit...    What about his family?
 It's not right. He got injured playing for them. They owe him another chance. He's worked too hard for too long... I mean he's not a horse.
But you can't let it get to you. You've got nothing to worry about. Just keep playing well, and things will be okay.
Yeah...   I know. Things will be okay.
What is your book?
Welcome to the Terrordome.   It's about sports and politics.
You study at, um, university?
Yeah, I went to Stanford. Studied history and baseball. Did you go to school back in the DR?
Yes.   Little. Secondaria?
High school?
Yes.   A little of... high school.   But I sign when I have sixteen years.
You signed at sixteen?   Wow.   So you didn't finish school?
If you no play baseball... what you do?
Um... it's hard to say for sure, but I like history, so I'd probably go to grad school... maybe teach someday.
Brad!   We're up for B.P.   Let's go.
These are grandma's from the other night.
We missed you at our meeting, Thursday.
Sorry.    I forget.
It's okay, maybe next time.
You want sit?
I gotta go actually, so--
Okay, go.
There was an injury to the Wichita right-fielder. They called up Brad this morning... He left you this...
Yo!   Sugar!
Holy shit!     How'd you get here?
On a airplane, motherfucker.
Great, you guys know each other. Sal's our new middle-relief man. Throws a nasty cutter. You could learn a thing or two from him, Santos...
Okay.
What he say?
 Don't worry about it... Good to see you.
Good to see you, too, Sugar.  I'm a little nervous.
Look, just remember... it's the same game we played back home. Same rules, different place. Just have fun. It's only a game.
Santos allows his second homerun of the game.   First night off the DL, and not looking so sharp.
Sutton makes the call to pull Santos here in the 4th, bringing in rookie reliever, Salvador Torres for his Bridgetown debut.
Strike!
Strike two!
Strike THREE!
A stellar debut for Torres, who records the final out, baffling Josh Lansford with a nasty side-armed cutter.
Welcome to America, kid.
Just do me a favor... don't give it away to the first white girl you meet.
You started dropping your arm in the third. I think that was your problem.
He lost control of his breaking pitches and they just zeroed in on the fastball, which isn't as fast as it used to be.
Earl...
Don't matter, he can't understand anyway.
I know it's hard when you don't perform up to your own expectations for yourself. But you need to learn self- control. Can you understand what I'm saying? You need to learn that your actions have consequences. So we're gonna take the cost of the water unit you broke out of your next check... That's not something your family back home's gonna be too proud of... Is it?
So you should think real hard next time. Think about channeling that frustration you're feeling onto the field. Into practice. Channel it into working harder--
--I am work hard! Everyday I work hard.
So work harder, goddamnit! You think you're the only one on this team works hard?
 I don't understand you. You speak too fast. I just don't understand!
Look, you may think I don't know what you're going through, but I do. I've been on the mound; I've played through pain. I've been in your exact situation before. I've struggled too... I've...
Listen, your first time, take a half. Okay? No more. You gotta ease into it. Half.
And anyone finds these, you didn't get them from me, okay?
What's up?
What's up, Sal?
Did you hear I made player of the week?
You told me last night.
Which one do you use?
That one.
Thanks.
Miguel Santos appears to be in top form tonight, striking out two of three in the first. I don't want to jinx it, but this sure looks like the Santos we knew earlier this season.
Top of the fifth and Santos is showing some control issues. Not sure what's going on down there, but he seems to be talking to himself.
Don't worry about it. You're all good. Just relax. Throw strikes. They can't touch you. Just throw strikes.
Strike!
 You're outta here!
Fucking Puerto Rican piece of shit!
 Fuck you, cocksucker!
I'm sorry.
You played with your emotions, and your emotions got the best of you. Happens to everyone. It's just a nasty part of the game. Nobody likes to admit it, but it is. The true test of our character as athletes... is how we come back. It's up to you.
Hardy! Don't wander off; I gotta talk to you about that accountant...
So, um, anyway, I'm bumping Sal into your slot in the rotation. I'd like to see how you handle a relief spot.
Moving up from relief, Torres makes his third start for the Swing. I tell ya, this lanky kid from the Dominican Republic has surprised us all with his unique delivery and precision. Reminds me of a young Pedro Martinez... Hey there Bees fans, don't forget, closing night is approaching fast and tickets are selling out. So pick yours up at the box office today...
Oh, honey, you don't have to do that.
 No problem. I want to help.
Well, thank you, Miguel.
Thank you, Helen.
I forgot something in the clubhouse. I'll be right back.
Here, I'll load your bag.
Where's he going?
Bathroom.
 Talk to me.
Is Jorge working today?
Jorge?
Jorge Ramirez.
Jorge, the ball player!
Yeah!
Oh. The ballpayer... He left about two weeks ago.
I think he drives a car now.
Do you have a phone number for him? His old one isn't working.
 Sorry... But I think he was staying down at concourse village on 156th.
He still comes in to eat sometimes.
 You wanta see the inside, you gotta buy a ticket, pal.
 Sorry.
One room.
For how long?
I don't know.
Two hundred a week.   First week in advance.
Two hundred now.
This also please.
You speak Spanish?
Of course.
Is this your place?
Yeah.    Can I help you?
I like your work.
Thanks.    What are you looking for?
Oh, no, I mean... I don't know. I was passing by and thought maybe you might need some help. I know how to make furniture, and--
--I don't have any work right now. Sorry.
Right.    Okay, thanks for your time.
Do you know any other places like this where I might find work?
Have you checked the classifieds?
If you leave a number, I'll give it to him next time he comes through.
 Erica?
Miguel!   My God, where are you?
Miguelito, what is going on? Frank called last night. Where are you?
New York.
Oh, my God! What are you doing in New York? I don't understand. Your team is looking for you.
I can't play anymore.
Are you hurt? What does that mean, you can't play?
No.   I'm fine. It just--
We've been working for this your whole life, Miguelito. Oh, my God! You're so close. I don't understand...
Don't worry, mom. I have some money. We're going to be okay.
You have to go back. Listen, Miguel, my sweet sugar, call Frank. They'll take you back.
I can't go back--
Did I raise you like this?    Did I raise you to give up?
I didn't give up. I'm starting something new here.
What?   What are you starting?
I have to go mom. The card's almost out of minutes.
Where are you even staying?   Miguel--
Don't worry. I'm staying with a friend. I have a new job. It's all good. I'm sending money tomorrow.
Miguel--
I love you.    I'm sorry.
Hey, um, I was in here the other day.
Yeah, sure, did you find your guy?
No. I'm actually looking for a job today.
Fernando!  Tell him you like his shirt.
And then put it in here with the others.
When it's full, set to scrub, and there it is.
Do you know anybody with a room for rent?
But I'll ask around, let you know if I hear of anything.
You and Jorge used to play baseball together?
Yeah, you like baseball?
It's okay. I'd rather watch soccer though... Have you found him yet?
Not yet.
He'll be through sooner or later.
How long have you worked here?
Two years.
Do you have family here?
No. My wife and kids are still in Mexico.
My family's in the Dominican.
Hi, um, do you remember me?
Yeah, but, sorry, I still don't have a job for you.
That's okay. I already found one. I'm actually just trying to make a coffee table, and I'd like to buy some wood and supplies.
I don't really sell raw materials...
I just moved here, you know, and I don't have a space to work. Do you think I could do some work for you, help you clean up or whatever you need, in exchange for using your shop? You don't have to pay me.
Somebody paying you for the table?
No. It's a gift for my mom.   Something I like to do.
How old are you?
Twenty.
Who taught you to make tables?
My dad.     He was a carpenter in San Pedro.
Is that where you're from?
Yeah.
I grew up in Santiago.    What are you doing in New York?
I came to work. I used to play baseball.
The whole world plays baseball. My son's sixteen. Won't touch a piece of wood that's not a bat. I never cared for the game, myself. Too slow.
Your mom still in San Pedro?
Yeah.    With my sister and brother.
So, you're telling me that you want to make a table for your mom, then mail it back to her in the Dominican?
What's your name?
Miguel.
Osvaldo.
Hello... Is Sofia at home?... Yeah, it's Miguel again... Can you tell her... Just tell her I called...
 You just going to watch or you going to help me out?
Where you from?
Ukraine.
So you never liked baseball?    Not even as a kid?
It's okay. Sometimes during the playoffs I'll watch a game or two.
Who's your favorite player?
I don't know enough to have a favorite.
C'mon, everybody has a favorite player: Juan Marichal, Pedro Martinez?
Fine.    Jose Canseco.
Jose Canseco!? That's the best you can do?
Okay, what about you?
Roberto Clemente.
 Never heard of him.
Shut up.
What's so special about Clemente?
I read this book where he said something like, "If you have the opportunity to help someone and don't, then you're wasting your life." And he was a carpenter too.
Get out of here.
For real. He used to make furniture during the off season.
Are you fucking with me? Cause you know I can google this fool right now.
Google?
The internet. Don't worry, I'll teach you someday.
When did you get released?
They didn't release me. I left a few days before the season ended.
You left?    When was this?
About two weeks ago.
Holy shit.   Where are you staying?
Oh, you know, with a friend. But if you know somebody who needs a roommate...
 Why'd you leave?
Do you have any family here?
 But I'm okay... I have some money saved, a couple friends. I'll go home to visit soon.
Do you know a place called Ukraine?
Hey!   You owe money.   Full week!
I know.    I have tomorrow.   No problem.
Yes, problem. You pay tomorrow or you have big problem.
 Love, keep this in your room for me. Just a few hours. Til morning. I'll be back.
Frank... It's Miguel.
Jesus, Miguel, what the hell happened?
Sorry for calling late.    I'm in New York.
I heard. You're making me look bad. What are you doing there?
I got a job, but I don't know if I'm going to stay...
Where you gonna go? The season's over... Your visa's expired.
I know, but I thought maybe I could...
I can talk to Alvarez... But I don't know. Nobody's happy about this.
I know.   Sorry.
Look, Miguel--
Hey, Miguel.
I don't know where to go.
 Fuck you, man!
Fuck you too, bro!
What happened to you?
Me?   What happened to you?
I been looking for you for weeks.
I know. Rafi said you took my old job. Welcome to New York!
I called the Higgins to give my new number, but they said you split. I couldn't believe it, man, I had no idea.
Things got a little ugly after you left.
We all go through slumps you know.
It wasn't a slump.
What was it then?
I don't know, but I wasn't gonna wait around for them to throw me out.
I'm just saying...
Whatever, man, you wouldn't be saying that shit if you made it.
 Sugar! Rafi needs you in the kitchen!
They call you Sugar?
What can I say? The name sticks.
They got all kinds in this league, bro. Like fat cats in their forties, kids like you and me, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, even some white boys. I got this fifty year old catcher on my team, used to play for the Dodgers. Can't run for shit, but he's out there every week. Belly out to here. My man can still go deep though... You ever hear from that kid, Brad?
I did some research and I got a new favorite player now.
Okay, good.
Vic Power.    You know him?
You ought to. Greatest Puerto Rican first baseman ever. But that's not why he's my favorite player... Back when he first arrived, 1951, 52, he was playing in the minors. Little Rock, Arkansas. So the story goes, one day before a game, Vic stops into this diner for lunch. Hadn't been here long, so he knew very little English. Didn't even notice the "whites only" sign hanging in the window. And Vic was Black. I looked him up on Google. I mean Black like you. So he sits down at the counter and the little waitress comes up to big Vic and says, "I'm sorry, we don't serve colored people."
So he leans close to the waitress, tells her in his best English, "That's okay, I don't eat colored people."
I got the photos you sent, but you'll have to send more.
Okay, mom, but you know it would be a lot easier if you opened an email account.
Email? I don't even know how to use the TV!
I'm making a new table for you.    It's going to be real nice.
I'm sure I'll love it.     Thank you.
How's Erica?
She's good. Got a job at the factory. Just part-time, though, so she can keep up with school.
And Luis?
He's pitching now. You should see him, Miguel, got an arm like his brother.
Yeah, but can he throw a knuckle curve?
I miss you, mom. But, I'm working hard. I'll be home soon. Give everyone a hug for me.
I will, Sugar. I love you.
I love you, too.
Caballo!   This is Miguel from San Pedro.
The new guy. You ready to pitch?
I think so.
It's been a while, no?
Don't worry; he's ready.
Felipe!    Meet Miguel.   They call him Sugar.
What's up, Sugar?
Felipe played for the Dodgers Triple-A team. Hit a dinger off Pedro once.
Twice.
Twice.
I played for the Yankees.
Cubs.
Padres.
Kansas City.
Me too!    Bridgetown.
I was there in 96. I lived on a farm.
With the Higgins!
Yeah!
Vamos!    Let's play ball!
 Just like old times.
Strike!
Strike two!
Strike three!
