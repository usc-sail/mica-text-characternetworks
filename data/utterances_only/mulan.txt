We're under attack!  Light the signal!
Now all of China knows you're here.
Your Majesty, the Huns have crossed our Northern border.
Impossible! No one can get through The Great Wall.  [The Emperor motions for Chi Fu's silence]
Shun-Yu is leading them.  We'll set up defenses around your palace immediately.
No!  Send your troops to protect my people.  Chi Fu,
Yes, your highness.
Deliver conscription notices throughout all the provinces.  Call up reserves and as many new recruits as possible.
Forgive me your Majesty, but I believe my troops can stop him.
I wont take any chances, General.  A single grain of rice can tip the scale.  One man may be the difference between victory and defeat.
Quiet and demure...graceful...polite...[picking up some rice with her chopsticks and eating a mouthful] delicate...refined...poised... [She sets down her chopsticks and writes down a final word on her right arm] punctual. [A cock crows]  Aiya.  [Calling out]  Little brother. Little brother.  Lit- ahhh, there you are.  Who's the smartest doggie in the world?  Come on smart boy, can you help me with my chores today?
Honorable ancestors, please help Mulan impress the matchmaker today.
Please, PLEASE, help her.
Mulan--
I brought a spare. [Mulan pulls out a cup from underneath the back of her dress and begins to pour the tea]
Mulan--
Remember, the doctor said three cups of tea in the morning--
Mulan--
And three at night.
Mulan, you should already be in town.  We're counting on you to up--
--uphold the family honor.  Don't worry father.  I wont let you down. [Mulan covers over the writing on her arm with here sleeve]  Wish me luck. [Mulan hurries down the stairs]
Of all days to be late.  I should have prayed to the ancestors for luck.
Yep, this cricket's a lucky one. [Cri-Kee falls over out of fright]
I'm here.  [Seeing a stern look from her mother] What?  But Mama I had to--
None of your 'xcuses.  Now let's get you cleaned up. [They walk together into the preparation area]
Honor to us all]
[all the while Bath Lady undresses Mulan and pushes her into the Bath] This is what you give me to work with? Well, honey, I've seen worse. We're gonna turn this sow's ear Into a silk purse. [Bath Lady moves the silk partition aside showing Mulan in the bath]
It's freezing.
in case I forget something?
[Mulan follows Fa Li and sees boy stealing a doll from a girl.  Mulan grabs the doll from the boy and returns it to its owner] We all must serve our Emperor Who guards us from the Huns A man by bearing arms A girl by bearing sons
ready.
[Walking to catch up with the other maidens] Ancestors Hear my plea Help me not to make a fool of me And to not uproot my fam'ly tree Keep my father standing tall
Guard our girls And our future as it fast unfurls Please look kindly on these cultured pearls Each a perfect porcelain doll
Please bring honor to us Maiden #2 Please bring honor to us Maiden #3 Please bring honor to us Maiden #4 Please bring honor to us Mulan and Maidens Please bring honor to us all!
Speaking without permission.
Oops.
Well...
And silent! [Matchmaker sniffs the tea]
Why you clumsy--[Matchmaker feels Cri-Kee in her dress and dances around]  Wooo, woooo, wooooooo, [Matchmaker knocks over her pot of coals, and sits down on the coals.  Matchmaker jumps around screaming]  Ahhhhhhhhhhh [Mulan grabs her fan and briskly fans the charred area on Matchmaker's behind causing it to flame up.  Mulan looks surprised about her mistake]
Reflection]
Staring straight Back at me? [Mulan puts her hand on the Great Stone Dragon and looks toward the temple] Why is my reflection someone I don't know? [Cri-Kee rowing across the pond on a lily pad] Somehow I cannot hide [Mulan walking into the family temple] Who I am [Cri-Kee watches Mulan in the temple seeing multiple reflections of herself in the ancestors' stones] Though I've tried  [Mulan bows to the ancestors] When will my reflection show Who I am inside?  [Mulan finishes wiping off her make-up seeing her reflection in the stones] When will my reflection show Who I am inside? [Mulan gets up and heads out the temple]
My, my, what beautiful blossoms we have this year [looking up into the blossom tree].  But look, this one's late.  But, I'll bet that when it blooms, it will be the most beautiful of all.  [Mulan and Fa Zhou share smiles.  Drums start pounding announcing the arrival of Chi Fu and two guards on horseback]
What is it?
Mulan, stay inside.
Citizens  I bring you a proclamation from the Imperial City the Huns have invaded China!
By order of the Emperor, one man from every family must serve in the Imperial Army.  The Xiao family [a family member steps up, bows to the guard and takes the conscription notice from the guard].  The Yi family.
The Fa Family.
No.
Father, you can't go.
Please sir, my father has already fought bravely--
Silence!  You would do well to teach your daughter to hold her tongue in a man's presence.
Yes, sir. [Fa Zhou walks back into the homestead refusing to take his cane from Fa Li]
You shouldn't have to go.
Mulan!
There are plenty of young men to fight for China.
It is an honor to protect my country and my family.
So you'll die for honor!
I know my place, it is time you learned yours.
Mulan is gone.
Ancestors, hear our prayer Watch over Mulan.
Hey, let me say something. Anybody who is foolish enough to threaten our family, vengeance will be MINE.  Hrrrrr.
Protect the family.
I...ring the gong.
That's right, now, wake up the ancestors.
One family reunion coming right up.  [ringing the gong] Okay people, people look alive, lets go! C'mon get up.  Let's move it, rise and shine. You're way past the beauty sleep thing now trust me!
I knew it, I knew it. That Mulan was a trouble maker from the start.
Don't look at me, she gets it from your side of the family.
She's just trying to help her father.
Not to mention they'll lose the farm.
My children never caused such trouble.  They all became acupuncturists.
Well, We can't all be acupuncturists.
No, your great granddaughter had to be cross-dresser!
Let a guardian bring her back.
the most cunning.
Silence!  We must send the most powerful of all [Motioning to the Great Stone Dragon as it is seen through the window]
Your mis-guidance led Fa Deng to disaster.
And your point is?
The point is we will be sending a real dragon to retrieve Mulan.
What?  But I'm a real dragon.
chance is that too much to ask?  I mean, it's not like it'll kill ya.
Go, The fate of the Fa Family rests in your claws.
Don't even worry about it, I will not lose face.  [Mushu falls down the hill under the weight of the Great Stone Dragon's head and lands on the dragon's pedestal with the head falling on top of him]
Ow, my elbow.  Aw, aw, I know I twisted something. [Throwing the head off him]  That's just great.  Now what?  I'm doomed!   And all 'cause miss man decides to take her little drag show on the road.
Chirp, Chirp.
Go get her?   What's the matter with you?  After this great stone Humpty Dumpty mess, I'd have to bring her home with a medal to get back in the temple.  Wait a minute, that's it!  I make Mulan a war hero, then they'll be begging me to come back to work.  That's the master plan.  Oh, you've gone and done it now. [Mushu runs off stage right]
Chirp, Chirp.
You're lucky?  Ho, ho, heh.  Do I look like a sucker to you?
Chirp. Chirp.
Whach' you mean loser?  How 'bout I pop one of your antenna's off and throw it across the yard.  Then who's a loser, me or you?
Shan-Yu.
The Emperor will stop you.
Okay, okay, how 'bout this?  Ahem, [in her manly voice] excuse me, where do I sign in?  Hah, I see you have a sword.  I have one too.  They're very manly and tough [Mulan bites her lip as she mishandles pulling the sword out of the scabbard and it falls to the ground.  Khan rolls on his back in laughter.  Mulan throws her shoe and hits Khan in the head with it quieting Khan].  I'm working on it.  Who am I fooling?  It's going to take a miracle to get me into the army.
That's close enough.
Get ready Mulan your serpentine salvation is at hand.  For I have been sent by your ancestors-- [notices Cri-Kee making a hand shadow of a dragon on the rock and stamps him down with his foot] to guide you through your masquerade.  [bending down to Cri-Kee]  C'mon, you're gonna stay you're gonna work. [returning to Mulan] Heed my word, 'cause if the army finds out that you are a girl, the penalty is death. [big flames shoot up from the rocks]
Who are you?
Who am I?  Who am I?  I am the guardian of lost souls. [Mulan smiles big in anticipation of seeing her guardian] I am the powerful, the pleasurable, the indestructible [coming out from the rocks to show his real size] Mushu! Oh hah, hah, pretty hot, huh? [Khan stomps on Mushu.  Mulan pushes Khan back]
Ah, my ancestors sent a little lizard to help me?
Hey, dragon, dragon,  not lizard.  I don't do that tongue thing [flips out his tongue to show Mulan what he means].
You're uh...
Intimidating?  Awe inspiring?
Then you're gonna have to trust me.  And don't you slap me no more, we clear on that?  [Mulan nods emphatically].  All right.  Okey dokey, let's get this show on the road.  Cri-Kee, get the bags [Mushu starts walking to the camp].  [to Khan] Let's move it heifer.
is it, time to show 'em your man walk.  Shoulders back,  chest high, feet apart, head up [Mushu pulls Mulan's head back]  ...and strut 2, 3, break it down, 2, 3 and work it, [Mulan walks into the camp drawing the attention the men who see her.  Mulan walks into a tent and sees a man picking his nose and another man picking out dirt from between his toes with chopsticks] Beautiful isn't it?
No, they're men.  And you're going to have to act just like them, so pay attention.
tattoo will protect me from harm.
I hope you can get your money back.
I don't think I can do this.
It's all attitude.  Be tough like this guy here [looking at Yao].
Punch him, it's how men say 'hello.'
Oh Yao, you made a friend.
Good, Now slap him on the behind, they like that.
Wu hoo hooooo.  [grabbing Mulan buy the collar]  I'm going to hit you so hard it'll make your ancestors dizzy.
Ya Mi Ah To Fu Da.
Feel better?
Yeah. [Chien-Po places Yao back on the ground]  [to Mulan while walking away] Aaaaa, you ain't worth my time chicken boy.
Chicken boy!?  Say that to my face ya limp noodle!
Oh, sorry Ling.  Hey!
You're dead.  [They fight on top of Chien-Po.  Mulan runs away.  Ling notices Mulan and then points toward her] Oh, there he goes.
Hey guys.
Excellent strategy, Sir.  I do love surprises, Ha ha, ha, ha.
You will stay here and train the new recruits.  When Chi Fu believes you're ready, you will join us...Captain. [General Li hands a sword to Shang]
Captain?
Oh, this is an enormous responsibility, General.  Uh, perhaps a soldier with more experience--
Number one in his class, extensive knowledge of training techniques, [leaning back smugly stroking his chin] an impressive military lineage.  I believe Li Shang will do an excellent job.
Oh, I will.  I wont let you down.  This is, I mean, I...[somberly] yes sir.
Most impressive.
Good luck Captain.  [The general and his mounted troops leave the camp]
Soldiers!
Sorry, [in her man voice] Uhh, I mean, sorry you had to see that.  [with her fist she taps Shang on the shoulder]  You know how it is when you get those, uh [pounding her chest] manly urges and you just have to kill something [slapping her hand], fix things, uh, cook outdoors.
What's your name?
Ahh, I, uhhh, I, uh--
Uhh, I've got a name.  Huh.  And it's a boys name too.
I didn't ask for his name.  I asked for yours.
Try, uh, ahh, Chu!
Ah Chu.
Ah Chu?
Gesundheit.  He He, I kill myself.
Mushu?
No.
Then what is it!
Ping! Ping was my best friend growing up!
It's Ping.
Ping.
Of course Ping DID steal my gir-[Mulan reaches back and grabs holds Mushu's mouth together]
Yes, my name is Ping.
Let me see your conscription notice.  [Takes the notice from Mulan]  Fa Zhou, *the* Fa Zhou?
I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.
Um, he...doesn't talk about me much.  [Mulan tries to hawk up a loogie and spit but the saliva just runs from her mouth.  The recruits laugh]
I can see why, the boy's an absolute lunatic.
All right, rise and shine sleeping beauty.  [Mulan rises and blinks] C'mon [rapping on Mulan's head with each syllable] hup, hup, hup. [Mulan groans, lies back down and pulls the covers over her head.  Mushu pulls the covers off Mulan entirely]  Get your clothes on. Get ready.  Got breakfast for ya.  [Mushu jumps onto Mulan's knee with a bowl of porridge]  Look, you get porridge, and it's happy to see you.  [Mushu shows her the bowl with two eggs and bacon looking like a smiley face.  Cri-Kee pops up out from the bowl of porridge] Hey, get outta there, you gonna make people sick!  [Mushu uses chopsticks to push Cri-Kee out of the porridge]
Am I late?
Don't talk with your mouth full.  Now let's see your war face [Mulan looks at him with wide eyes and chipmunk cheeks full of food]. I think my bunny slippers just ran for cover.  C'mon scare me, girl!
What do you mean the troops just left?
I'd like a pan fried noodle.
Oh, oh, sweet and pungent shrimp [Ling and others begin to laugh]
Moo goo gai pan
That's not funny.
Yeah, 'cause I owe you a knuckle sandwich.  [grabs Mulan by the shirt collar drawing back his other arm.  Mulan hides her face with her hands.  Ling looks away, closes his eyes, and puts his fingers in his ears so that he wont hear anything]
Soldiers!  [The soldiers line up quicky.  Shang takes off his shirt and grabs a bow and quiver of arrows.  Mulan is duly impressed by Shang's physique] You will assemble swiftly and silently every morning. [Shang walks down the line of soldiers] Anyone who acts otherwise will answer to me.
Ooooo, tough guy.
One moment, you seem to be missing something.  [Chi Fu brings out two large bronze disks.  Shang takes out one disk and holds it high speaking to all the troops]  This represents discipline  [Shang hands the weight to Yao and the weight falls to the ground taking Yao's arm with it]  and this represents strength [Shang hands the other weight to Yao making him fall to the ground.  The troops laugh while Mulan looks concerned].  You need both to reach the arrow.
We've got a long way to go.
And you haven't got a clue [Shang throws his hand down into a river and retrieves a fish.  Mulan throws her hand down into the river and retrieve's Yao's foot.  Mushu comes out of the water with a fish in hand to give to Mulan] Somehow I'll make a man out of you!
This doll came from a village in the Tung Shao Pass, where the Imperial Army's waiting for us.
We can avoid them easily.
Hey, oh, ah, no, this is not a good idea.  What if somebody sees you?
Okay, all right, all right, that's enough.  Now, c'mon, get out before you get all pruny and stuff [holding out a towel towards Mulan keeping his eyes covered].
Mushu, if you're so worried, go stand watch.
Yeah, yeah, [walking in a womanly fashion speaking in woman's voice] stand watch Mushu while I blow our secret with my stupid girly habits. [back to normal] Humph, hygiene.
Me first! Me first! Me First! [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po run by Mushu smacking him in the face with colored boxers]
Ah.  We're doomed!  There a couple of things I know they're bound to notice!
Hey, Ping.
And I am Yao, king of the rock.  And there's nothin' you girls can do about it.
No we don't. [unnaturally]  We could just close our eyes and swim around.
C'mon don't be such a g--Ouch!  Something bit me.
Some king of the rock!  [Yao pushes him off the rock]
Boy, that was close.
I never want to see a naked man again.  [the rest of the troops run by naked and jump into the lake]
Hey, don't look at me.  I ain't biting any more butts.
They completed their training.
Those *boys* are no more fit to be soldiers than you are to be Captain.  Once the general reads my report, your troops will never see battle.
What?
You like him don't you?
No, I--
Yeah right, Yeah sure.  Look,  [pointing to Mulan's tent] go to your tent.  [Mulan walks away with a look of delight. Mushu talks to Cri-Kee]  I think it's time we took this war into our own hands [rubbing hands together].
Okay, okay, let me see what you've got.  From General Li, dear son, we're waiting for the huns at the pass and it would mean a lot if you'd come and back us up.  [sarcastically]  That's great except you forgot, "and since we're all out of potpourri, maybe you wouldn't mind bringing up some."  Hellooooo, this is the army!  Make it sound more urgent, please!  You know what I'm talkin' about?  [Cri-Kee starts writing the note again]  That's better, much better.  [taking the note] Okay, Let's go.
Khan-ie baby, hey, we need a ride.  [Khan squirts Mushu off his back with water from his mouth]
Who are you?
Excuse me!  I think the question is who are you?  We're in a war man!  There's no time for stupid questions.  I should have your hat for that, [the panda starts walking forward] snatch it right off of your head [swiping with an arm at Chi Fu's hat.  Mushu turns the upper half of the dummy around after the panda passes Chi Fu.  Chi Fu begins reading the message].  But I'm feeling gracious today, so carry on before I report you.  [the panda walks up a tree taking Mushu and Cri-Kee with him out of sight]
A Girl Worth Fighting For]
Moo
What do we want? A girl worth fighting for!
I don't understand.  My father should have been here.
I'm sorry.
The Huns are moving quickly.  We'll make better time to the Imperial City through the Tung Shao Pass.  We're the only hope for the Emperor now.  Move out!
What happened?!
Uhhh--
You just gave away our position.  Now we're--[an arrow hits Shang in the shoulder as he falls to the ground.  Shang pulls out the arrow]  [calling out] Get out of range!!
Save the cannons!
Oh sure, save the horse.
Fire!
Fire!
Hold the last cannon.  [Yao poised to light his cannon, pauses.  Shan-Yu and his troops appear at the top of the mountain]  Prepare to fight.  If we die, we die with honor.
Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu.
Ping, come back.  Ping!
Arrrrr.
Do you see them?
Yes! [Yao shoots an arrow with a rope attached]  Perfect!  Now I'll pull them to safe--[Yao grasps at air as the rope completely passed through his hands]--ty.
I let them slip through my fingers. [Mulan's arrow lands in Yao's hands.  He grabs on and is pulled toward the cliff, the soldiers grab onto Yao and hold him steady near the cliff edge with the rope taught over the cliff]
Pull
I knew we could to it.  You da man. [Mulan looks pleased] Well sorta. [Mulan grimaces]
Step back guys, give 'em some air.
Let's hear it for Ping!  The bravest of us all.
Ping, what's wrong?  [Mulan removes her hand slightly to show the blood on her hand and seeping through the armour] [loudly] He's wounded, get help!  [Ping starts to pass out.  The images of Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po begin to fade as she loses consciousness] Ping, hold on.  Hold on.
I knew there was something wrong with you.  [Chi Fu takes off Mulan's hair tie and throws her to the ground]  A woman.
I didn't mean for it to go this far.
It was the only way.  Please believe me.
A life for a life.  My debt is repaid.  [turns and walks towards the Imperial City]  Move out!
I was this close, this close to impressing the ancestors, getting the top shelf, an entourage.  Man, all my fine work, ffft.  [Mushu picks up a dumpling with his stick, slumps down in front of the fire Cri-Kee made and begins to cook the dumpling over the fire] [glancing up] Hi.
Eh, come on, you wanted to save your father's life.  Who knew you'd end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors, and losing all your friends.  You know, you just gotta, you gotta learn to let these things go [looking as if he's about to cry].
Maybe I didn't go for my father.  Maybe what I really wanted was to prove I could do things right.  So when I looked in the mirror [picking up her helmet and looking at her reflection in her helmet] I'd see someone worthwhile.  But I was wrong.  I see nothing.  [throws the helmet down and a tear runs down her cheek]
What!?  What do you mean you're not lucky?  You lied to me?  [Cri-Kee nods] [to Khan]  And what are you? A sheep?
I'll have to face my father sooner or later.  Let's go home.
Yeah, this ain't gonna be pretty.  But, don't you worry, 'kay?  Things'll work out.  We started this thing together and that's how we'll finish. [Mushu hugs Mulan.  Mulan smiles]  I promise.
Rrrrrrraaaaaaaaahhh!
Home is that way! [points to the opposite direction Mulan is heading]
I have to do something.
Did you see those Huns!?  They popped out of the snow, like daisies!
Are we in this together or not?
Chirp, Chirp.
Well, let's go kick some Huny buns!  [Jumps onto Khan and utters fighting words as they ride off to the Imperial City]  Wu Hu Ha Ga, Wu Hu Ha Ga
Make way for the heros of China.
Mulan?
The Huns are alive, they're in the city.
You don't belong here Mulan, go home.
Why should I?
Now where are you going?
My children, heaven smiles down upon the Middle Kingdom.  China will sleep safely tonight thanks to our brave warriors.
Huh?  Oh, I'm sorry, did you say something?
Mushu!
Hey, you're a girl again, remember?
I know what this means to you, Captain Li.  Your father would have been very proud.
I'll Make a Man Out of You  plays in the background during the next action sequence]
Boo.  [Shan-Yu steps into the balcony next to the Emperor] [to Hun Bald Man #1 and #2] Guard the door [they walk off down the stairs that lead to the balcony].  [pacing around the Emperor]  Your walls and armies have fallen, and now it's your turn.  Bow to me.
Okay, any questions?
Does this dress make me look fat? [Mulan slaps him]  Ow.
Who's there?
I tire of your arrogance old man.  [yelling and putting his sword at the emperor's throat] Bow to me!
No matter how the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow to it.
Then you will kneel in pieces. [Shan-Yu draws back his sword to strike the Emperor]
Chien-Po, get the Emperor.
No!
No!  [He looks down at the crowd and realizes he cannot find the Emperor among the throng of people]  Yrraaaaahhhh!
No!  I did!  [Mulan pulls her hair back to look like she did when she was a soldier]
So what's the plan?
Ummmm.
You don't have a plan?!
Hey, I'm making this up as I...[looks out a window and spies the firework tower] go. Mushu--
I'm way ahead of you sister.  C'mon Cri-Kee. [Mushu and Cri-Kee jump onto a kite and use the wings to soar over toward the fireworks tower]
Citizens, I need firepower.
Who are you?
worst nightmare.
It looks like you're out of ideas.
Not quite.  [calling out]  Ready, Mushu?
ha ha ha ha.  [Mushu's catches Cri-Kee with antenna on fire as Cri-Kee falls toward him] [to Cri-Kee]  You are a lucky bug. [Mushu pinches out the fire on Cri-Kee's antenna]
'Tis a woman.  She will never be worth anything.
Your Majesty, I can explain.
I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan.  You stole your father's armor, ran away from home, impersonated a soldier, deceived your commanding officer, dishonored the Chinese army, destroyed my palace, AND...you have saved us all.  [the Emperor bows to Mulan]
My little baby's all grown up and savin' China.  [to Cri-Kee] You have a tissue?
Chi Fu,
Your Excellency?
See to it that this woman is made a member of my council.
Is she allowed to do that?  [Shang, Ling, and Chien-Po shrug]
Um...[Mulan grins]  You... [Mulan smiles] You fight good.
[turning toward Mulan and grunts with disappointment in himself] Hmm.
Khan, let's go home.
Sir?
You don't meet a girl like that ev'ry dynasty.  [The emperor puts on his hat and walks back up the steps to his palace]
Mulan.
Father, I brought you the sword of Shan-Yu [hands the sword to Fa Zhou] and the crest of the Emperor [hands the crest to Fa Zhou].  [with head bowed] They're gifts to honor the Fa Family.
The greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter.  [Fa Zhou wipes away Mulan's tear then hugs Mulan]  I've missed you so.
I've missed you too Baba.
Great, she brings home a sword.  If you ask me she should have brought home a ma--[leaving her mouth open when she sees Shang]
Woo, sign me up for the next war.
Would you like to stay for dinner?
Yeeeeeahhhhhhh.  [Mushu runs to his post and Cri-Kee bangs the gong awakening all the ancestors]
Take it Cri-Kee.
True to Your Heart -- No characters sing in the song]
Thanks, Mushu [kisses Mushu on the forehead].
Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark
