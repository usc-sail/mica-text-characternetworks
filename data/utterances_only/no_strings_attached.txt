What about "Comrades-in-Fuck"?.
No.
What if we say we're in the Axis of Fuck? we formed a Fuck Alliance. We're neighbors 'on.. Fuck Street.
What's wrong with "buddies'?
Who says "buddies"?
Yeah, you're right.
It tickles.
Yeah. It does other stuff. But there's a boy on the, edge of the group : A sweet. face, 'and you wouldn't be surprised to- find but he's Jewish: A 12 year - old, Adam Kurtzman. He's the only boy not looking at Katie. Instead, he's staring off in another direction.
Hey. -
Hey. A 'long' pause'. -They're not looking at each other. Then
Do you want to, freak?
You freak, good.
Okay.
- "No, I don't want no scrubs"--
I don't get it.'
Urn. She doesn't want a -scrub; Because he's hanging out of his. best friend's ride, trying to -holler at her. Katie, in another part of the dance floor, is in the middle of a big freak-sandwich.
Emma scowls at her, looks at Adam.
Let's go to the dumpster-
So.
I've enjoyed camp. There's all kinds of fun activities. For example, I learned how to-archer.
That's good. That'll be useful if you ever make a time machine and go back'to the medieval ages:-and then your-time machine breaks, and you get attacked by knights.
You're funny. It's weird.
My life's pretty.fucked ug'.
My parents are gettinga divorce..' That's why I had-to go--to carp. SO. The couple making out next to them rolls over.really close. ..Emma pushes them back over.
Marriage sucks my ' butt .
Yeah. it sucks it. It sucks it. all 'ni-ight.
People aren't meant to be together forever. .'

I like frenching with you.
Okay.
Are you crying?
Pretty much.'
Why are-you crying?
Because- because camp'-s almost over-
Jesus.. Exwaa pats him a'couple times on the shoulder.
Look. I'm not really an affectionate person. Emu a, very uncomfortable, puts her-arm around him. He lets her. They.don't look at. each other.
Can I finger you?
Na.
Okay.
The-hot blonde, KATIE 11, is wearing her sexy-little nightgown and dancing to Ontkast's "Miss Jackson-"-
She's dancing with a -hot athletic guy,, SCOTTIE', ..who is trying to keep up with her sexy dance. moves,. but is mostly just waving his hands in the hair. At the edge-of the'group, two guys that don't look,that great in their boxers- ADAM, now 21, covered-in hair, and his friend,'ELI. Eli stares at Scottie dancing with the hot blonde, Adam is too busy kissing VANES,SA, a nice girl.

Uggh. I'm gonna go get more beer. -
Okay. I want to get'y"ou.wasted" tonight.
I'm just getting a beer. Vanessa walks away.

okay, well I'm from the United States, and I want to give that girl a penis mask.
Why? That's not even hot.
Um. Yeah it is.
You think it's hot to just sit there with your penis.on her face?
Look. Scottie's got a gay nipple.
What do you mean?
Look at it.
Oh yeah. That nipple is definitely more gay.= You can tell by the way it wants to get legally married to' the other nipple.
.,My dads are gay. I'm not ashamed of

She's got bat.eyes.

She's got angry bat eyes. Like staring at you from the dark. Its. pretty hot . I'd fuck.a bat. A bat in a cave. A hot bat in a cave. Adam starts to walk -over to her.

Wow. So grew up-to-be a lot smarter than nip.
Uh-huh. 'It's scary actually, how smart I am. Sometimes my neck gets sore because my:brain is so.big.
My neck gets sore. when I-eat string, cheese. Sometimes.. so what are you' doing Here? -At a party of Frat.
I'm trying,to get someone to rufee me'. I keep holding out my cup..
I'll rufee.you. I was gonna save it for a Freshman but whatever- I'll take you out to.the alley,. I'll light some candles- Some girls near by give Adam a dirty look and walk away.
So. Times have changed. We've grown up. Do you have -a girlfriend?
NO. Yes. Over there. Vanessa. Is her name. ANGLE ON- Vanessa, by the beer, talking to a bunch of other girls. She sees Adam and makes a kissy-mouth.

"Disks -and Balls".. Or "Dicks, Balls, and .Dogs" and'i'd ptit -pictures of dogs in it too.  I- don't know, I'm weird, deal with it. So why won't she sleep with you?
What do you need to be ready for? The rest of your life? It's just' sex, Adam. It's not a marathon.'You don't have-to train.
Oh yeah. I guess everyone hapsex at - MIT.
MIT can get crazy Kids are pretty much ready to fuck anything-. They know that based on attractiveness, they're on - the bottom of -the ' - biological food chain, so if the' opportunity comes along for procreation, they better fucking. ridethat shit.
What's'up with your.face?
I don't get it.,
It's like, beautiful.
My girlfriend's not fat-
Oh- yeah-. she seems great-
She is great- He rips open her shirt.
And I feel really'bad about this. He puts starts kissing her chest. Then starts coughing.
Oh. I got too much boob izi .my mouth.
Aren't they cool? They move around and stuff.
You didn't have boobs at Camp. Weehawken. Your boobs were still little stars in the sky. I had such a.big crush-on.you, Jesus. Emma starts taking off his pants.
Hey. Hey. Actually. I can't do. this.
Was the trumpet sound weird?
No. I just-I can't cheat on my girlfriend..
-Oh. Why not?

Yeah, but I'm keeping your pants.
Really? '
No. Here. She gives his pants back.
Your dad-was on that show?
Yeah.-That's him.
I always hated that TV show. T think it first came out when I was. teething, and I've just always associated it' with. pain in my gums.
So do you do this stuff all the . time? It.'s okay if you 'do, I might. call you a ho but it's okay-
No. I don't. But I don't have a problem with it.
What?
The affairs of the. heart. The fleeting passions of a drunken night.-The wayI .see it we're all just these big dumb.. animals. who, for the most .part; just want  to have sex with each other.: So maybe we should stop beating ourselves up for what-we feel and just make sweet bone.
You make a c ompelling  argument .
And also, it's somewhat improbable, but I like you. Adam beams.
Don't smile. Jesus.
What?
You want 'to come with me tomorrow? I have to go to-this-'stupid thing.
Um, I think I... . Yeah. Ii11 go with you. ' What is it?
Some stupid thing.
What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck?'
You have cookie on your face.
You said "some stupid thing." I thought you were getting your hair cut.
Oh. No.
You were burying your father.
Yes. NEIGHBOR DARIA comes up to-the food table.
1 , .'m so sorry Emma. He was such a good man. He was always sibi.ling.

.And who are you? Are you Emma's boyfriend?
No. ."11.m just-
I'm.her.baby--daddy. Adam. puts his hand on her stomach. Emma looks up at him, getting the joke. Glad to be'saved.

But the truth is, I don't even know- if it's mine.
Of course is his. He'.s the only ope I bareback with.
Yeah, thank you for being sorry for me. Have a nice day. Neighbor Dana walks away. Emma looks at Adam, smiles.
I wish:I'could take you to a funeral'every day.
You should try the Chex Mix.It',s. theBold Party Flavor.
E3ow-do they make it so bold?
I should've got him to move this pool out of here before-he went back to the hospital. Sandra hands-the bottle to Emma, who takes a swig.
What? Yod were going to stop  him from dying so he could come home, first and lift all the heavy stuff? That would'vejustmade him-want-to die faster.
It's okay.
Yeah. He was not the greatest.-  You should have left.-
I loved hint. Why?
Because you're crazy. Because you thought he'd change. Because you still root for the Tigers.
The Tigers are gonna come back.
-Yes..And maybe leprechauns are real.
You don't believe in anything hopeless, Emma?
The Toothfairy. And paying off my student loans.-Are you gonna come back inside-,-Mom? Because it's kind of depressing in there.- It's like. somebody died.
Yes. I think I will go back in. -You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get-so drunk I can't walk and then I.'m gonna watch "Bambi" and cry for a couple hours.
It's good to have a plan.
Id say- we should hook up or something, but I've gotta get back' before Mom watches "Terms of Endearment."
No- I' get it.
I'm glad you came.

Condoms, condoms, condoms-
They're in,the box, down by the-
It's like an Easter Egg hunt. But ' we're ,not celebrating Christ !
Inside the box there's ..a box- Adam takes out a large vibrator, the "rabbit",.

Is there a Rite Aid bag?,. ,Adam takes out a couple books.
00, "Snow Falling on Cedars "- what did you think of that?
Jesus. Ema, naked, runs past him, grabs a string of condoms and runs back to the bed. He gets up and chases her.

I don't really do relationships. I've tried and I'm not. good at it. After a couple months ,  my throat - starts to constrict and the walls start throbbing.
Like a peanut - allergy. -
Yeah, like an emotional peanut allergy.
What's an "emotional peanut"? Ha, ha.
You're on the rebound, you. should be having meaningless yet sate .sex at every free moment of the day. You need another relationship like you need someone to jump :out of that closet'and throw-a brick-at your head.
Oh my god, is that going, to. happen?
Look, I'm attracted to you---
And I of you. To you.
I'm going to be working 14 hour days and I just need someone who's going to be there at'2am, in.my ' bed, and who.I don't have to lie to or eat breakfast with-
I hate breakfast. And lying. And also war.
We need.to-make some ground rules.
Don't call me in the middle-of the - day to tell me you were "just thinking about me." No buying me things. No crying. No jealousy.

You asked her to throw a "beer at you. -
Why did'you say you had a wife?
1-don't know. Because people make jokes about their.wives. -
Why don't you just talk about your real life? -
Because I suck.
You don't suck. Just.keep doing it.
You sucked. Tell me the next time you do stand-up and I'11see if I can get myself arrested first.
Thanks for being friends with Eli, I know it can't be easy.

That sounds fun.
Oh' yeah. Sex on the couch.: Sex on the floor. Sex on' a boat. In a box. With a fox. in a house.' Ona mouse. . I do not-like Green Eggs and Ham. I do not like them. . -Emma.
I don't want to go out with Scottie anyway. He's too good looking.

It's just so soft--
He just left, he didn't even say good-bye.

Should I just,. like, ask her -out? I don't know how to 'do it. I sort of work with her-
Say: "Hey; I'Yre 'always wanted to know what you look like when you're not kissing ass."
That's a good.idea.
No it's a terrible idea, Jesus.
What-about "Let's-go get some coffee and bitch about work"?
Girls don't sleep with guys who use the verb "to bitch".
Flipsies?
They flip so Emma's of top.

That was my favorite show.
Thank you, Father. The Priest laughs.
You're so amazing. Adam spills some coffee, the craft services guy' glares.

I wanted to see you, buddy.
Buddy?
I want'to take you out to-dinner. With Vanessa.'We want to take you out to dinner.
Oh that's nice, but I 'don't really want to eat in a place where you're also eating.
Come on. We've got to talk about. this. It would mean alot. Come on. I'm going to stay and take pictures with the priests until you say yes.
Good. I'm glad that's settled.
It's so thick. Sumaire is looking at Adam's neck on an exam. table. Emma comes. in.
Oh -hey,. Emma. I'an freaking out about my neck-hair.
He said-he knew you.
Do you think it's possible that I unknowingly got bit. by adog and somehow, through a series of genetic mutations, I'm starting.to become. a dog? And now I'm :going to. have dog-powers-. Like smell And the power of bark.
 Yeah. Could be. I'll write that down.
And if I shave it,.:am I zapping my body of some sort of strength? Is it secretly "strength hair"?
Oh. That's a good point. What if it's "secret strength hair"?
should I take him up to psych?
No, Emma, I .don't need to: go to "psych," I'm just a-normal guy who's looking for answers: about his -neck--hair . . Oh my god, -oh my god, it's killing me,- I'm dying, this is dizziness,- check, this is heart-rate= increase, check-' - '
No Adam, this is because you're having dinner with your father..
T know that!
Yeah, that'll do it.
Please give me drugs. Sumaire and Emma-just look at him.
1gave him a milligram of. Benzodiazepine; so that's' the medical equivalent of hitting him with a large heavy object: and leaving him on the side of the road.
Look. My hand is a hammer.-
I just' worked 14 hours. i - Em a is really annoyed. Dr. Metzner,walksby, looking. over.
You're a good girlfriend.

Adam holds up his'car keys to Dr. Metzner.
made you.a hat.
I hope you're not going to use those car.keys'to drive.
Put on the hat.
You don.'t have to put anything on.
Put on the hat. Dr. Metzner puts the car keys on his head and doe$ a funny little dance. Enmia smiles at him. He smiles back: Adam sees it.
Give me my hat back. Now. -Now.
Emma-sits in her car, Adam is-on the sidewalk. He- can see
Vanessa and Alvin- through the window,- sitting waiting table in a relatively nice restaurant.
I'm all over this. I am 200 percent on my game.
No.
Not at all? I'm not airborne? Emma looks very. annoyed.
., So. How long have you two been. dating?
We're sex friends.
Yes. Yes we are. Awkward.
Happy Birthday, Adam.
It's your birthday?
It might be. Yes.
I got you a gift-.
I. love it. Thank you.
No it's- the gift is inside the bag.
INSIDE THE HAG! Wow! Adam takes out a set 'of - expensive looking- sheets.
I remember you only had one pair so. A tense ' moment .
I -loved you.
.Alvin is everything I loved about you, but he's just.a little bit more mature. Adam starts banging his head against the table.
Adam's-had a long day: I think he .should probably go home and rest.
What happened?
He 'actually- he had an allergic reaction to his own hair. If he hadn't come in when he did,-we might have lost him.
Oh yeah?
You know what the word 'is'? I've been thinking and 'I figured it out.
The word is Twat. Dad, you're a twat.
Sudden outbursts of emotidn are common. The. patient sometimes shouts out-things like-
want to swordfight you.
For example. - Adam stands up holding out his napkin as-a sword. Some people around the rdstaurant-look over.
Adam, we're happy- it's agood thing for everyone---
(imitating her voice,
Cha-cha cha aahahahcha--
I think-we're going to call it a
Hey, I know it wasn't-the right thing to do,but I!m,not good at doing the right thing. I've tried and I'm not .good at it.
When'did you try? You don't try. You just take. You take and take
What? You really want to-fight? Alvin stands up. A tense moment. Adam pokes at"the air a couple times with his napkin, but he's moving incredibly slow. -
You're too fast for me'.
M'lady. Is't thou chamber:hath -thou.
Let's get the fuckout of-here.
-Let's get the fuck out of'here. They start to walk out of the restaurant. Adam runs back and hits his dad as hard ashe.can with his napkin,- he runs back to Enuaa.
Ha; ha. II win. I win.
(turns back around,
It's the best sex of my life. Alvin and Vanessa- watch them leave.
I. always loved Venice as a kid. Because I thought: Atleast I'm not as crazy as these. people.
-But you are as crazy as-these. people.
Not him. There's a guy coverred'in silver body paint., yelling at'.the top of his lungs, and skating by on :a -skateboard.
who's got' the crazier-family?
I don't know, we'd have to develop an elaborate point'system.
I knoww. I've-never been in love. What does it feel like?.
Home.
Is that good?
Sometimes. Here. Adam gives the sheets Vanessa gave-him to a.guy'dressed as a cat.
For the kitty litter.
So. Sleep.
Oh. I thought we were having fun,
He strokes. her face, it's tender. It scares her.
Emma. .
You're breaking a rule.
What rule?
You're not allotaed to say '''Emma and look longingly in my. face.
That's a bad rule. He kisses her- .it's passionate, a grown:-up, kiss. it takes her off guard. He looks at her, serious,, inches from her face. She's uncomfortable, laughs nervously.
Hey, go to sleep. Emma heads down the hallway.
.Wait--
Am I running fast? I can't. tell. She turns around and sees him, laughs..
Go back to bed! Emma runs down the stairs, outside.
I can't do this.
What? What am I asking you to do?
Nothing.
So what's so hard about that? -
I love you.
EMPTY_LINE
love you. Be my-girlfriend.
Don't operate a motor vehicle. Adam, too tired to chase her, watches her walk to her car.
I'll operate your motor vehicle.
Good night..
Be my girlfriend. ' Be my. girlfriend forever.
Hey, you want to get the Addam's Family?
I got em. . '
Thanks dude.
 Sounds great. Emma does a routine check and the man groans, starts to shake a-little. The heart rate monitor picks up.speed. EMkA _ Sir?-Sir? Do you have pain? No orie answers her. The woman won't=break eye contact dith the.man. Some nurses rush in.
Do you feel something-- The tone of the heart rate monitor..Emma tries to; pump his heart with her hands. He's dead. The woman still won't break eye 'contact with, the .man. The teenager isn't- looking at a:ll.- The Nurse turns off the equipment, -looks to Emma', who stands frozen.
 The time of-death. Eimna walks out of the'room, past Dr. Metzner.
Dr. Netzner'nods, walks into the room. -
I'll take care of it.
I didn't know you smoked.'
I don't. I just- I .asked someone if I could borrow it. I mean- you can't borrow a cigarette-. I don't know- I don't smoke.
I'll just. Hold it. Which is weird. So. I hope you're okay-with that.
 People are going to die, Doctor Franklin, that's part of the job.
Yeah, I know that. I'm not, an idiot, Dr. Metzner. Respectfully. With a lot of respect.
Everyone else flinches. I:'ve never seen you flinch.
Well. I guess I'm like everyone..
No you're not. - Dr. Metzner tosses his cigarette, turns around to leave.
My dad smoked cigarettes.,
He -quit?
Be died.
Ah. That's the fun. part- for everyone who ' dies, there's always someone else you can fix.: And. then - - you go home and ti-y to. sleep. Welcome, to  the world.,- Emma. -Henry leaves. FEMALE INTERN, smoking-a little further down, has been listening to the whole thing. she raises her .eyebrows.
He's married. 3ust'so you know. Emma throws the cigarette in her hand 'away..
 Hey, can I come-over later? Adam, on the sound stage, is watching some crew guys pack up some lights. - ;

Oh. That's great!

I'm trying- to remember what people do on dates.
I don't known don't do that shit. I guess just smile a lot.:Are you. smiling?
Good.
I love-broccoli. Sometimes I think I'd like to live in a broccoli forest. But I would be made out of carrots. Adam's face is frozen into a big, fake smile.
T brought you a pamphlet.. She gives :him a "Quit Smoking" health pamphlet.
You don't.have to face thiss alone-.
Yeah. I like that about you..
No, I don'.t.think so.
Oh, I'm sorry, I sh.ouldn.'t-- .He touches her face. Kisses her lightly.
Let's get an enormous bed.
Tt's enormous!
You're beautiful.
You're near-sighted. Put on your reading glasses.
You should be. talking about your mother..

What did your therapist telL.you to do about me?
Not this. He kisses'her. Kisses her again.'.
That?
No. Not that. More kissing.
-Flipsies?
What did you _say?
Do you' want to get on top?
Can we just do it where you're, like, lying on me?
Yeah, cool. That sounds like fun. Adam continues on,. he's not having the greatest time'..
You're the Old Testament God. - Because you just, like, made me out' of clay.
Well that sounds good.
Okay, An awkward moment.
I have to go.
'Yeah of course.
I feel- really close to you..
Well. You are really,close to me:
I know. I'm a'jerk.
You're not a jerk, you're just- deeply flawed.
Are you jealous?
No.
Okay.
I got laid tonight too. And she'.s sleeping on all the-pillows. Why does she need all the pillows? Is her head made of paper?
There's an extra. pillow in your closet.
It's just- It's the first time since Vanessa, not counting you,
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Nothing..
You're jealous.
Your voice gets really high when _ you're- lying. -You sound like a munchkin. -
 No' it doesn't!
. .I'm not jealous!
Hey, where have you been?
Oh you know, I've been busy.
Doing what?,
Going to gang-bangs. I've been getting. involved in the gang--bang community.
Are you trying to make me jealous?
(pretending to, talk to
What was that? I can't hear you-- oh, I have  to go,  this girl is asking me if she can give me a vagina mustache- have you ever heard of that? No, stop. tickling me, you -tickler!
This isn't going to work-
I'm sorry, I have to go play her pussy like it'sa'harmonica.
Adam! Adam hangs up.. WIDEN TO REVEAL- He's in front of a synagogue, wearing a kippah.A middle-aged woman. stands looking at him.
Shabbat Shalom.
 "Big pimpin", spending G's, I be big 'pimpin' on b-l-a-g' s" .
Those aren't even the words- The Child Actor holds up a box of.tampons- pissed.

You're the best!
Just come over later-
Oh man,. i can't, I.'m doing so much- crazy sex .stuff, I am. exhausted. Emma, is there a word for when you've . been pimped ' rain?
That's too bad you can't come over. Because I'm naked right now. Adam freezes. Emma tries to quietly.. clew her sandwich.
Yeah?
Oh yeah, I'm so naked, Adam,- and I'm just lying on.a big bed with lots of... turkey...
Totally.
Mustard or mayo?
Both.
You're so funny in class-
Do youthink'I'm funny?
It was funny whenyou were Hillary' Clinton and.you _got eaten by. that bear. I didn't know Hillary Clinton could scream like that-
Yeah?
Wow. Yeah. 'You're so talented.
This is bullshit.
Oh, I'm sorry, can't talk, I'm groping--someone against my car. Joy gives him a funny. look.
Fuck you.
Fuck you. Adam hangs up the phone, smiling.
Hey, you want to get out of here?
Stop. Stop singing that. Joy walks up to the 'door'.
Hello?
Hello.
Oh Joy, this- is my-
'I'm his doctor. I did his testicle transplant.
Oh my god!
Yeah, we had to do an-emergency, ball. removal. We actually replaced them with the-balls of a small. donkey..
Oh my. god, you have-donkey balls?
I should'have told you.
I just have to do a quick check on them.
But it's so late- Yeah,-isn't it?
Yes, that's right.
I'm sorry, Joy. You're sort of a pawn in a larger game.-It's my
Bitch.
This is amazing.

Ring, ring, it's-the pumpkin patch, they want their pumpkin back.
Oh my god, you were crazed, I felt like Flava Flav-
Just shut up and fuck me.
Wow.
-So I think your balls are going to be fine.
I noticed you'didn't.say I had a. donkey cock,
-I got you a birthday present. Close your eyes..
open them. Emma is holding-a -rubber chicken with a ribbon tied around its neck in a bow.
Oh my god.
I just-.1 figured you were the kind of guy who'd like a rubber chicken.
Yes.'i am that guy.
It's like: What's funnier than a rubber chicken?
Nothing. Nothing is funnier than a rubber chicken.
You can put it in a pot.
Throw it in the shower when someone is showering.
Hit people with it.
And -they're like:.Aaali, .why are you hitting me with a rubber chicken? They kiss, it's- .tender.
I love it, I love my -chicken. What are we doing? I have to take you out.-I have to go on a date with
What do you mean?
Like -a.date. Like - I pick you up. We talk about our favorite books and TV shows and I pay for everything and then you reward me with an over- the-jeans cock rub.
That sounds terrible.
Come on, I'll take you to a museum.
Why would I.want to go'to a museum?
Is this what you want?
So much,-so much it's freaking me out.
.Okay.
You look great.
I look like shit on a biscuit. What are those flowers for?
.(hariding her the flowers You.
Why?
- T don't know, because you're my flower.
I know- I'm good at this. They get into'the car. Adam opens the car 'door-for her.
How long does it take to'go to a museum? An hour?
We're going to the Getty.
2 hours?
Jesus Christ.
I can't believe you made fun of my, music-when all you do is listen to Neil Diamond.
I made a date mix,
 Oh god..
What did y ou do today?
I chocked 5 ,prostates and I drained a genital wart. Adamturns the music up.
"rind us a dream that don't ask no questions-- bah, bah.'bah--"
Okay- where'.s the bathroom?
We don't have-.time for the bathroom. You're gonna have to man up. He takes her arm and they run-off..
This one is called The, Tri=ph of Chastity. The swan represents chastity. Emma puts her arm around him. and starts to, kiss his neck.
. Oh yeah? That's so : interesting-
No- no, kissing on the date She keeps kissing him, ..he's enjoying it.
No- not in front of "The Triumph of Chastity." JUMP CUT-. Adam and Emma in ,front of another painnting..
I bet you can.'t guess what this one's called.
Um. "Man with a pink flower."
You're right! The painting is literally: A man with a pink flower. JUMP CUTS-- A series of paintings with the Madonna, Jesus, Angels.
So I guess there are no paintings of enormous dreidels'.
Oh, I think I saw one called "Jew Eating Baby." JUMP CUT- Van Gogh's Irises.
T h is one's good. Is it for sale?.
This was.Vaness.a's favorite.
Ley, I think T'.ve got' to get back.
No, come on, you've got to see the' garden, it's like a gay Japanese monk had a nervous breakdown with a pocketful of'seeds.
It's beautiful.
I told you.
Do what? Spend time with each other' that doesn't involve ripping our clothes off, time that does't involve you texting me at 1 in'the morning and me running over like your little sexbunny- A nearby kid covers his mouth and starts giggling.
This is what a relationship is!
No it's not! Maybe that's what You did with Vanessa or whoev er, but ' that's not who I am, Adam. This stuff freaks me out.
I want -to be nice to you and do nice things for you- -
You already do nice things for me!. You make me laugh and you fuck my brains out. Some people- ipok over.
(lowers her voice a
Why do we have to do what-everyone else does?
Because T-can't do it-doing anymore if you're not my girlfriend!
Why does it matter if I'm your girlfriend or not, Adam? Why do I have to be yours?
Because .I'ia tired of pretending' that I don't feel anything, I'm tired of pretending like it doesn't -kill me to think that you're with anyone else- This is what people do, Emma-- they buy each other flowers, they go to museums, they don't sleep with other people-
Oh you mean like your parents? Like my-parents? Why would we let ourselves' get hurt when we don't have to?.
Because I want to get hurt by you. If I'm gonna get- hurt, 'I want you to hurt me.. Be my girlfriend.
No.
Goddamn .it. You drive me crazy--
You drive Me crazy-
I wish there was some way I could legally cage fight you.
I'll take you down. I'll take you 'down to Chinatown. I'll serve you dumplings filled with me kicking your ass.
what? She slaps his hand. He slaps her hand back. They start "slapping each other's hands.
Why are you messing everything up?
Why are you afraid of being loved?
Why did you get c6ckblocked by your father? A guard comes over.
You guys need to keep it down, this is a medi.tatioix garden.
This is our way of meditating.
 Yeah.
I want to lock you in.atiny, windowless room with just.-my butt.
1 ,wish I was a hamster, so I could play dead, and then when you put your hand .in the cage, I would jutp up and kill you.
Impossible.
Fine,, I'd jump on your face, and I wouldn't let:go, and your whole' life people would be-like: "Why do you have'a hamster on your face?" Why won't you be my girlfriend?
What if-we get-sick of each other and you get angry because I work all the time ,and then. I stop working and then I never do all-the things I want to do- and-
'You think anyone does all- the things. they want to do, Emma?
What if.we have kids and then we hate each otherand-we.have a 'horrible. divorce just like.your parents?
-Then the kids will start a rock- band together like Oasis.,'.
What if I get cancer and you don't want to take care of'me?
Then-you should hire a hit man to kill me- '
What if I'm never around and. sometimes. I'm mean to you and we only have'sex on our anniversary?
We'd take a cruise'to spice up our love life!
I don't want to take.a cruise to spice up our  love-' life !
We'd go to. couples therapy-
What if you have-an.-affair with our couples therapist?
We'll go to a couples therapist with female facial hair.
What if you have an of fair with a model?
You'd, be proud of me !
-You're right, I would--
And I'd just have sex with the model a couple times and then I'd buy you a diamond necklace and apologize.,
I don't want a-diamond necklace because you slept with a model! Emma pushes him, he falls into some'flowers.
.I'11 never give you a diamond necklace! Emma' jumps in the flowers frith him.
I want a diamond ziecklacei
I'll give-you one every day l They grab each other and start making out. They pull aWay from each other and keep pushing-each other::
I want to microwave your dick-
I want to tit-fight, that means I want to punch you in the tits a lot. They start Making' out again.. A guard comes over and grabs them one'on each of his arms. A' father, holding his Toddler. daughter, watches then.
 Please don't grow up.
I know.
Because I can't keep doing this.
I know,. I get it.
You do?
Yeah. So. Good-bye. Emma gets out of the car.'
I'm really not going to see-you again.
I know.'. I think'that's probably smart. Good-bye..-
Yeah. Bye. See ya! Not! Not gonna see ya.. Emma leaves, shuts the car door. She walks into the hospital, upset, trying to keep it together.
I'm really not going to see you again. Emma looks- up- Adam is standing' across the room, by the doors. The nurses look at her, confused.
I I know .
Seriously. No more. Not going to happen.
I know.
Good-bye. They, look at each other- waiting for something. to happen.. . The elevator dings. She gets on. He watches her get on-
Shit.
Fine, great. Adam walks'through.the hospital doors, back to his car.;
Yeah, yeah, we're bumping and we're grindih'- we're in. da club-
'What?
Let's get out of here.
I'm not.looking for a relationship-
Me neither!' That's so funny, neither one of us wants to mean. anything t o other one- we just want to hook up! Like fish! Like a fish -hook! (puts his finger 'in his mouth like a fish, hook) Oo, sex doesn't mean-.anything, aaagh, I.'m a fish! Look at me, I like sex and I'm a fish.
No, where are you going? Let's hook up and not give a fuck about each other! I want that tool.I'don't care about you at all! Where are you going? She's gone. He'puts-his head against his. car. Another girl walks by.
Hey, hey, buy me a shot.
I can't believe it. He's on fire.
I think what we. have here is an important life lesson: When you hate, everyone and you don't give a shit, a lot of girls want to have sex with you.
I don't want a relationship right
1"'m just not very good with
I. won't be able to call you,, I'm getting sent to Guantanamo tomorrow-
I just farted right when I threw up. The girl is running away.
1. think guys should"make an effort to be- more polite. Like if you know you're never  going to call her again, at ' least. send a' Thank You ' Caxd.
I like'to go the extra mile. If I'm drunk and pass out-before you cum, I'll-send you a gift certificate to Berl, Bath, and Beyond. People seem to be digging it, Adam is enjoying it. He seems more comfortable in'his skin.
So I got some commercial auditions. lined up.
Great, I'll do anything that makes any kind of money. Just maybe not something where I.have to ride a. horse-and then underneath it says: Herpes.
Got it. Say hi to your Dad for me.
You know my Dad?
Yeah,' he told me to go see your show.
Oh. He did? This comes as a 'surprise- it's not-clear what Adam thinks..
Dad.
.Hey, I wanted to call.to'- . I know you're probably mad at me,, but--
Thank you. Dad. For 'a. lot; of . things. Alvin smiles, relieved.
Yeah kiddo, I can do some-things right.
Are you buying drugs.right now?
Oh. I- um.

Adam has his hand awkwardly draped over her shoulder. It's not comfortable for either one of them.
That was.

 Hello Los :Angeles. Emma, with a hoodie over her scrubs, comes in the back.
Someone told me recently that I look like Richard Nixon when I Gum. Adam does a little- imitation of what that looks. like. Emma smiles, -kind of embarrassed. She looks over and sees Alv n and Vanessa there too, laughing.-She's surprised'.
And it suddenly became clear why none of my girlfriends ever wanted to have sex with me. I thought it was just because my dick was too big and it scared them-But apparently-that's not the problem. At all. Actually, I've heard it's like acupuncture- you're- on your back the whole time and you don't even feel it go in. That's what my ex-girlfriend told me before she started dating my father. Vanessa and Alvin laugh, Vanessa covers her head with-her hand.
Actually they're getting married. So Mother's Day just keeps getting better and better. (MORE JOKES

I don't need the apology shit.
I don't care if you need It., just stop for a second. so I can' explain--
Explain what?
Emma, you can't just call me and tell me that now everything's different, now, you love me, now you, want to be.my girlfriend- after I spent-months trying to get over you somehow, trying to tell myselfto forget-you- you can't just .call me and, expect me to just come running- which I did, I know, but I can't just jump back in, I can't just start over, all of a sudden.
I know.. It doesn't- work that way.. I . get i.t . They look at each other, at a loss.
Maybe-we just-'I don't know, maybe we blew it. Maybe ' our.'timing was
.Maybe, but maybe that's just the way. it. happened. Maybe we were just growing up. But I'm in love with you.
I want to write it on myforehead, t want to buy a t-shirt that's says: "I love.Adam Kurtzman" and wear it around all day long. What do you want me to do?.
I don't know.
I want that time back. I want to break all those rules. I want to try this. Let's try.
Yeah. Okay.
But we should still, you know, see
Come on. We don't 'have to break up, we never even started.
Wait, Emma, I have to go on again-. A guy comes. out of the club and calls.
Hey, Adam, get in here- Adam. runs back to the building.
Don't go anywhere, okay Emma watches h:im - go. She gets in her car, closes the door.
Are.youstill working? I'll meet you outside.
Is everyone gone?
.Vanessa went home to walk the dog.. We- have: a dog now. She named it Freckle. I don't know what to do about that.
I'm completely in -love with someone, and I'm brainstorming ways that I can never see her again without ruining my life.',
How'd.you get so screwed up?
I'm just like you- I'm going to fuck it all up. Like you. -Like you gave up on Mom.
' When ' we -first , had you, we hadn't slept in days, we were just shoving' food in our mouths over the sink whenever we could. And finally, I got it together enough to get. some take-out from one of the -restaurants we used to like.
And I set it all out on,the table, and the second we sat down, I think it was the first bite I took, you started crying. And your Horn and I looked at each-other-and just
uncontrollably laughing., We're on the floor, we can't breathe.. that kind of laughing.
So why'd-you start dicking around?'. Why'd you leave her?
I don't know. I-think the. simplest answer is: I'm a jerk. And--the. other answer is: Because - at -some point, we forgot how to make each other laugh.. And if that-sounds like a bullshit answer, you're probably right. But if it 'sounds really deep, then - that-'s, good too.
You're an asshole.
But you're not. Call her.
Don't tell me what to do. . I'm going to. call her.
So. Great. Let's do this.
Emma.
What. do you have- an hour? A half an hour?
I know. i
Yeah. I think so. -He walks up and puts his arm around -her.
How does this work--'head on your shoulder, head on- your .chest?
Whatever you feel like. She puts her head on his shoulder. it's uncomfortable, but it feels good.
I've got to go soon.
Are you okay? Honey? We just-got home.
I think I get it, Mom. Emma starts to cry, hard.
It hurts.
Yeah. It does. They 'don't-say anything- Sandra sits on the front steps of the house and just listens on the other end as. Emma cries.
Emma Franklin--do you know where she is?
I can't-tell you that, and.no.
whatif I start running through the hospital and taking everyone off - life support? -
