Fifteen minutes to delivery.
All clear from above.
What's happening?
What happened?
We've been hit. We're taking on water.
Grab the professor, quick!
Something must be below us! Shoot! Shoot!
Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, United States Navy. I'm gonna get you outta here. But you have to do exactly what I say, when I say it. My way -- no highway option. Do you copy?  Where's the briefcase?
How did you know where I...
KEEP SHOOTING!
Give it a second, they're almost out of ammo.
Now Lieutenant. Chopper's four meters at your 10 o'clock.
 I've got the Prof and the case. First round's on me back at Virginia Beach.
Hold on.
You know how to swim?
Oh my God. I can't believe you... how'd we... That was the most incredible...
Better keep that on `til we get to the rendezvous point.
 Why? Poison gas?
 No. I'm just not big on chit chat.
Lieutenant, thank you. (He pats his briefcase) You saved more than just my life today. Can I call my wife to let her know I'm okay?
Negative. Not imperative to the mission. We have to keep moving. I have strict orders to get you out of here safely.
I'm safe, Lieutenant. Please. She thinks I'm dead.  Don't you have a family?
 Make it quick.
Joe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler.
My kids. It's voice activated. Designed it myself. I do security, that's my specialty.  Those guys back there tried to get this case open for five days -- couldn't crack it. And you should see what happens to you if open it without the code. I have a picture of my kids in here, you want to see it?
Negative.
Battery's dead...
Honey, I'm alive...
We're almost ready.    Just gives us a -
Professor, RUN!!!
Captain, sir.
As you were Lieutenant.
We've been through a lot together Shane. You're the best man I ever trained. And a good friend.
... I know sir. And I except full responsibility for the mission's failure.
Why the hell did you let him use the satellite phone?
He had to call his family. A lapse in judgement on my part that I regret sir.
... Plummer was the best security expert the department of defense ever had -- a genius. He was working on a program that scrambles launch codes. He called it G.H.O.S.T.: Guided High-altitude Scrambling Transmitter. One pulse from the GHOST satellite and a country can't launch its own nukes. That's what the Serbians kidnapped him for, but they couldn't get S inside the briefcase.
The case was empty sir, as I stated in my report.
Not a surprise, really. Not like the professor to hide things where someone might look for them. G.H.O.S.T. is still out there,  which is why I'm going to give you another shot.
Sir. Thank you. I... appreciate your confidence.
I'll need to put a team together. I'm gonna need the mini sub, I need access to an EP3 aries 2 spy plane...
 Negative. It's not that kind of mission.
Two days ago, I got a call from the professor's wife... Widow. She told me someone had broken into her home. Searched the place, top to bottom. 
She's scared. The family's scared. Whoever killed the professor must think G.H.O.S.T. is in that house. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Either way, I need someone to stay at that house, and protect them. And while you're there -- find out if the program is in there.
That's it? Why would you want me for that, sir.
The professor's wife requested you.
Honey, I'm alive. Listen: A lot can happen between here and home -- if anything happens to me, call Lt. Shane Wolfe. He's a good man... anyway, I should go. I'll call you in an hour. I love you.
... You gotta problem with this mission?
Sirnosir. It's just that... I've never been very good with kids, sir. Not even when I was a kid sir.
Mom! There's some weird bald guy at the door!
 Look, if you're with the Hare Krishnas, we're not interested...
 Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, reporting for duty.
Of course. I'm so sorry.   Thank you for coming.
Come in and meet the rest of the gang.
KIIIDDS!!!
Get your butts down here and say "hello!"
You've already met Lulu. This is Peter, Zoe and Todd. Kids, this is Lieutenant Wolfe. He's the man who is going to be staying with us for a while.
Hi.
And this is Helga and Tyler.
 Ma'am... Baby.
Kids, go finish your homework.   And I'll be checking.
You have a pleasant family, ma'am.
Charles wasn't around too much. His work took him all over the world. He'd be gone six or seven months at a time. So I think for the younger ones it's a little confusing. Zoe and Todd... well, they're dealing like your normal teenagers. Maybe in Todd's case semi-normal.
Mrs. Plummer, I have to tell you that I did everything I could...
Charles was in a dangerous business. I knew it when I married him. No one's to blame here.  Everyone thinks that Charles told me or the kids where he hid it. And until G.H.O.S.T. is found, we're all in danger.
Nothing will happen to your family as long as I'm here. I've dealt with much...
That's Gary. He was Charles'.
Mrs. Plummer-
Call me Julie.
... Mrs. Plummer, I'll go secure the perimeter.
I'm glad you're here-
Julie, it's Bill Fawcett. I have some potentially good news.
What is it?
A safety deposit box under Charles' name was just found in Switzerland. I think it could contain GHOST.
That's wonderful. This could all be over!
There's a catch. Swiss law says only his family can access it. I'm going to need you on a plane tomorrow morning.
I'll be there.
Don't worry about the Kids, Helga will handle everything.  But if there is an emergency, all the emergency numbers are on the fridge. And on the phone. And on the back door...
Mom -- we'll be fine, chill.
 I know, it's just... I am a mom, it's my job to worry. ... I love you guys. I'm gonna miss you. I'll be back in 48 hours. And guys, whatever Lieutenant Wolfe asks you to do... do it. Okay? ll the children nod in agreement except Zoe who pops her chewing gum bubble.
Lieutenant, I don't want you to worry about anything except the safety of my children. Helga will take care of everything else.
Don't worry. They'll be safe with me.
Everything will be fine, Mrs. Plummer.
Tell me, are you licensed to kill?
... No.
 Too bad.
Prepare to be annihilated!
Could you turn that dow-
Hey-
... Where's the baby?
You run a very loose ship.
You don't like it? You're the SEAL. You do something. I make bottle.
... Zoe?
He's my boyfriend, tool.
So you're the one who broke in. Zoe -- go back inside.
Okay, fine... come on Scott.
Not with this kid.  You -- Gimme twenty!
I meant PUSH-UPS!
... I'll call you, Zoe!
My apologies. We had an intruder. A simple misunderstanding.
 We speak English, Kojak.
Oh. Sorry.
... Look, about the 2000 decibel alarm and the kleig lights and stuff... we own a bakery, so we're up kind of early. Would you mind?
Sorry.
Thanks a bunch. Oh, and we found this in our pool filter... Try to keep that zoo reigned in, huh baby-sitter?
Your mother thought you were in real danger. You should have told her the truth.
Who do you think you are -- my dad?
Let me go! It's Saturday night.   I have plans!
Not anymore.
Lights out.
Bite me!
When you're down and low, lower than the floor. And you feel like you ain't got a chance. Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Peter Panda Dance. Just hop three times like a kangaroo --
Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do. Three steps forward, one step back.
Then quick like a turtle lie on your back! riggle like a snake `til you can't no more.
This family's in for a rude awakening.
Huh?   Wha--?!
W-what are you doing??!
You're burning daylight. Move.       Move.
It's Sunday...!  And it's six a.m. You're insane.
Now move it!

Hey. Not in front of the kids. he gives him a look of disbelief.
What's it matter? Nobody speaks Romanian.
Usca mi-as chilotii pe crucea lu mata!

Listen up, ladies. Your behavior is unacceptable. In order to maintain a state of safety we need to maintain a state of discipline and order. I've only got one rule: Everything is done my way. No highway option. Do you copy?
Do you copy?
What?   I said -- do you...
 What?   I said -- do you...
Do not copy me!
Make up your mind.
eter farted.
Tracking devices. Now that I know I can't trust you... Never take them off. The panic button is only for emergencies. Touch that -- you better be dying, or you're dead.
I am not wearing that. Just because my mom's paranoid doesn't mean we have to take orders from you.
Let me explain how the chain of command works. I tell you what to do -- and you do it. End of chain. Now I'm not gonna have time to learn your names. So you are --  Red 1, Red 2, Red Leader, Red baby... wait, where's the older male? There were five.
 He walks like Dracula, with footsteps silent like death --
He's in his room.
Red 4!    Open this door!
It didn't have to go down like-
All I need is a hammer and some plaster of Paris. I can fix this.
Can I get by?
Here's your bracelet. If you'd been wearing it, this wouldn't have happened.
He has to go.
SORRY DUDE!
Whhhoooooo!
Stop it, Peter!
Hey, hey, good soldiers aren't afraid of anything.
This house is haunted. Daddy even said so. He said there's a ghost.
Really?   And where is this ghost?
I don't know.     I've never seen it.
Here he comes...!
He's coming back-
AHHH!!!
Uh-oh.
As we discussed, this is an urgent matter.
Can't you call somebody? Do something to get us around all this paperwork?
Sorry. Not in Switzerland, I can't.
This is absurd. If we can't get some faster service, we're going to have to file a complaint.
Marcel!
Oui.
Je ne comprende pas.
 I'm so sorry, the chief does not speak English. But I can tell you -- you will have access to the box tout-suite. As soon as your background checks clear.
Thank you. How long is that?
AGGH!     These brats!   Sugi Pula!
Red Leader, remain calm --
I am calm. I QUIT, that makes me calm!
Let's not be hasty.
Hello---  Don't even think about it.
Ah, Mrs. Plummer. (covering the phone, so Julie can't hear the struggle) No no -- everything's fine. You're gonna be gone how much longer?
Five business days?
That is not a problem. Just doing my...
Duty.
Ah! Things are GREAT!!! You do what you have to do.
Take care, Mrs. Plummer.
Red Leader! I command you to come back! That is a direct order! You can't leave a man behind!!
 I don't know the Peter Panda song!!
Don't worry, if she loves you, she'll come back.
Okay, listen up. There's been a change of plans. Your mom's not coming back as soon as she thought...
 When is she coming back?
Soon. In the meantime, we're just gonna have some more big fun.
That's what we've been doing?
But tomorrow's a school day.
I need a signed release for Driver's Ed!
I've got Brownies!
Whoa, WHOA! HALT! We'll take this hill one inch at a time. Only then can we rise to the challenge. All for one, and one for all!
 "Be all that you can be!"
That's Army. I'm Navy.     But I appreciate your enthusiasm.
Tell me that was the duck?
Hey.   HEY!
The things I do for my country.
Hi. Zoe thinks you look like the Hulk. I think you're cute.
 Thank you.
Do you know Kung Fu?
Affirmative.
Did you ever punch someone so hard that their head came off?
What's that medal for?
None of your business.
I'll trade you a SpongeBob button for it.
Is that so people can't hurt us?
I think -- it's time for you take a nappy- poo, in beddibye land, little girl.
Do I look like I'm five to you?
What are you waiting for?    Dig in.
Don't worry, I can get lots more of those. And I've survived off this stuff for months.
Like I'm really gonna eat all those carbs.
Okay, ladies. Your mama -- is not here to take care of you now. So -- here's how it's gonna be. We're gonna pull together, all for one, one for all. If I say in, you stay in, if I say out, you go out...
Ba ba do the hokie pokey...
I did not say at ease!
He's only two, he doesn't have any idea what you're talking about. I don't have any idea what you're talking about...
Can you kill a man with your bare hands?
You play too many video games. Yes.
... I can cross my eyes. Wanna see?
Negative.
Tyler hates it when I do that...
Plummer residence... yes, I know it's Monday. Oh. Thank you, sir.
Who was that?
Your vice principal. He said if you're late again, you and Todd are expelled. He wants to see you in his office. With your ... legal guardian.
We're gonna be late.
Not on my watch.
I always said these kids didn't need a baby sitter, they needed a parole officer. Looks like Mrs. Plummer finally listened.
 What's your name, son?
Wolfe. Shane. Lieutenant. I'm in charge of watching these kids for... a few days.
aby-sitter huh. Well, whatever work you can get. I'm Murphy. Duane. V.P in charge of discipline, conduct and truancy. Top to bottom, K thru 12. You're in my house now, boy. I coach wrestling, too. (re: Todd:) And the creeper here played hookey from every wrestling practice this month.
She's missed twenty-two Driver's Ed classes. Out of twenty-three. They're the worst students in my school.
Your school?
Good morning kids. What are you doing in my office, Murney?
I was explaining, that as vice principal, I am in charge of....
Very little. I thought I asked you to find out who stuck to the baloney slices to the cafeteria ceiling with mustard?
I'm got some leads. My informant's about to crack.
Then hop to it. I think I can handle this from here.
Red 1, Red 2. Get moving.
So. You're the new baby-sitter?
Bodyguard. You see, Mrs. Plummer called my captain, she thought the kids needed -
It's okay, Lieutenant, I was briefed of the situation by Mrs. Plummer. She told me all about you.
Lieutenant, huh? You with "The Teams?"  Petty Officer Third Class Claire Nelson at your service.
... You're kidding?
Four years at Naval base Coronado.   The Service paid for my college.
"Honor, Courage...
Commitment". That's the way I live my life, and the way I run my school.
Can't be too careful. So. Permission to stick around and keep eyes on the kids?
Permission granted. Welcome aboard. Just try not to frighten the children.
No one will even notice I'm here.
Clean as a whistle.
Back off. Official Business.
Give up now. Save us both a world of pain. Now -- last time: Open the hanger, Black Hawk coming in.
Open in T minus three, two, one...
What would you say is the secret with kids, Mr. Wolfe?
Show no weakness.
I'll drink to that. (she toasts, with milk.) Shane... Can I call you Shane?
... Sure.
So. When you agreed to serve your country, I bet you didn't know you'd be serving creamed bananas to one year olds, huh?
Hey -- I out rank you, you know.
Not here, you don't. You're on dry land, lieutenant. Well, not so dry where you're sitting, I guess.
Oh, man...
Don't take this personally -- but you're pretty good at this. Seriously, I'm impressed. A whole day, and all three Plummer's stayed out of trouble. That's... unusual.
Kick his butt, Todd!
Who started this?
He did.
Todd started a fight with five students at once?
The kid's mixed up. Look at him.
If I catch anyone on the team fighting again, next week's tournament is off. I don't care who starts it.
You heard the lady. Any more fighting and there'll be no more wrestling. Personally I think that's a little harsh. Boys'll be boys.  `Scept for Plummer here.
... Nice moves, man.
Pretty slick, Frogman -- I'm a black belt myself. S'why they asked me to coach the wrestling team.
See -- total control. Maybe you could stop by practice, we'd show the boys how a couple of pros do it, what do you say? Come on, promise I'll go easy on you.
... Sorry, sir. I'm on duty.
Oh, yeah. That's right. I forgot you had to baby-sit. Maybe some other time then.
Looks like pretty boy there's all bark and no bite.
... Don't even think it, Murney. He'd kill you so fast, I wouldn't even have time to get my camera.
Another day, another dollar twenty, minus taxes... aren't you gonna change him?
I'd love to, for one who'll eat, and not cry.
That's not what I mean, Lt.
Oh -- change him. Roger that. Uh...
Sirnosir. Not my job.
But...
Instructions are right on the box. Bathroom's down the hall. Have fun.
Emergency!
See! My nanny can kick your nanny's butt.
Thanks.
What hell do you think you're doing?
Tell me where the kids are and I'll let you all live!
Buddy, you're about to get a beat down.
Red 1?   Red 2?
14 year old Male, weird hair. 16 year old female. Ditto.  Cancel that a.p.b..
In the future, use our nonemergency number. That's the one to call if nobody's fleein' or bleedin'.
Shane are you okay?
 Just fine, thank you.
I should probably get going then. If you need anymore help... Call.
oo hoo! Hubba hubba!
Who are those people?
It's my troop, it's Monday. Monday, Wednesday and Saturday are troop nights.
Get rid of them.
I can't. Everybody's parents go out on troop nights. They won't be home `til ten. Mom's our den mother.
Tonight we're supposed to sell cookies.
Selling cookies isn't imperative to my mission.
We have to. If we don't sell enough cookies, we can't go the Jamboree, and if we can't go to the Jamboree.  Come on, Shane. You gotta help me out. They already think I'm a loser. And it's not like I have any other friends, cause mom never lets me out of her sight...
Alright, ladies. Here's how it's gonna be. Tonight, I'm gonna be your den -- commander. That means if you want to live to see tomorrow, do as I say. DO WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER?
Den Mother? ... I'm scared of you.
Good. Now -- wait here.
... yeah, he's a total psycho. I think mom found him from one of those Tough Love boot camps or something...
This is totally cruel and unusual! You can't do this -- we could run out of air!
.. he's got us on lock-down, it's like Oz or something. No, not munchkin Oz -- HBO Oz.  Hm... I dunno if that's a good idea, Scott...
I gotta get supplies. I can see you through the window, but if anything happens...
 I know.
Oh no... they're back.
Brownies?
BEAT IT, before I get my face punching badge on you.
Where are my troops?
Nope. You wanna buy a raffle ticket? We're trying to win .22's.
What happened?  Well?
Those boys over there broke our cookies.
Well then -- I'm afraid I have to eliminate them. If I don't come back -- avenge my death.
No!
This is not a toy. I'm here to protect you. Not cookies. Get in the car, we're going home.
You can't take us home yet, you're supposed to take us to dinner.
Where?
Welcome to Chuck E. Cheese!
I wish I were in Chechnya.
Anything elsh I can do for you?
In a big glass    This much ice... this much cyanide.
How `bout a re-fill on that pischer of Mischer Pibb?
What?
 Pischer of Mischer Pibb?   Mischer Pibb?
Let's fight!
I'm watching your brother...
I pressed two player. I thought you liked combat. Unless you're scared.
Prepare to be annihilated!
That's not fair. Nobody can jump thirty feet.
The Hulk can.
That wasn't a documentary.
This isn't fair. My joystick's broken.
You wanna switch?
 You don't have a baby on your chest...
You're not even trying...
I AM TOO TRYING.
Too slow... come on -- take a shot... oops too slow... swing and a miss...
In your face! I am the greatest hand-to- hand combat champion in the entire world!
Mom -- stop worrying.
I'm a mom, it's my job to worry.
Seriously, everything's cool. The guy's just a control freak.
It's only a few more days. I hate leaving you, but you know I have to do this. I love you.
I know. Don't worry, we're okay. Tonight I'm just doing homework -- in my cell.
Dude, this is outta hand. Who are all these people?
Jus' ma peeps. And the folks who read my BLOG.
Dude, not cool...
Move, move, move! Go go!
I figured you'd come back for him -- they almost always do.
Inexcusable, to leave a man behind like that...
Relax, we once found a kid in the ball pool when we opened in the morning --
WHOA, Whoa. Not okay, freestyling in the ball pool -- not okay.
Should we send someone in after him?
Clear out! GO GO GO!
Party's over.
No one leaves until this house is spotless! I want to be able to eat off the floor! The latrine! Hell, I wanna be able to eat in the kitchen!!
Oh no you don't. Now, we're gonna do this my way -- no highway option.
Start swabbing, ladies.
This is officially the worst party ever.
It was YOUR idea! I don't even know most of these losers.
... Thanks a lot, Rambo. My friends will never come here again.
Those people aren't your friends. They show no respect for you or your house. Because you have no respect for yourself.
I do too respect myself.
You got barf on your tank top. Company, downstairs!
You're not my dad!
We hate you, you hate us. You're like a robot. Why don't you just leave us alone?
You're right, Red 1. I'm not the man for this job.
Shane --!
In all my years I have never been treated with such disrespect. Not even from the enemy. Don't worry, as soon as your mom comes back, I'm gone.
Now what?
It's Scott...
Puberty... talking doesn't do any good. Go to your rooms.
 Go!
GHOST -- hand it over!
Okay -- who wants some?
Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow ow! Crap!
Kids.   It's safe. You can open up.
Please don't leave us Shane.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm sorry for giving you a hard time.
Shhh... It's okay.
Who were they? What did they want...?
They're looking for a program, that your father invented.
So Mom's not paranoid? There really are people out to get us.
They're not after you. They want this. But nothing's gonna happen to you, as long as I'm here. And I'm not going anywhere.
But I can't do this without your help, okay? We need a little more cooperation here.  Tell you what -- let's start over. From now on, you listen to me, and do what I say. (to Zoe and Todd:) And I... I'll listen to you too. Deal? Truce -- okay?
C'mon c'mon c'mon...
Hey mom we're fine, absolutely nothing happened you should worry about. Nope.
Mrs. Plummer... two men tried to get into the house tonight.
Oh my god!
No - it's okay. They're gone, everyone's fine. They were looking for GHOST, but they didn't find it. You have any luck?
Well, yes and no. We found something in the box... But we're not sure what it is. Bill thinks it's part of the GHOST. It looks like some kind of "key". We just don't know what its for.
The good news is I'll be home in two days, as soon as the customs paperwork clears.
 ...So soon? We were just starting to have fun. Don't worry -- we'll be just fine.
I gotta warn you guys: From now on, I'm gonna be sticking even closer.
Will Shane Wolfe please report to Vice Principal Murney in the gym.
Ooooooooh!
Don't worry. So, she wrecked a driver's Ed. car -- she'll pay for the damage...
That? Lady drivers, what do you expect. No, it's not that -- it's the boy...
Red two? I mean Todd?
Ordinarily I would wait for his mother to return... but -- I'm a bit concerned, and I'm not sure what to do...
Has he been skipping class?
Well -- yes. He does always miss sixth period. But this...
This is how he showed up to practice. And that's not all. I was doing a little re- con in his locker... and I found this:
If he'd had Hustler or something, boys will be boys -- but this is just sick.
He's not a NAZI.
It's certainly not normal.  See if you can talk to the boy.   Find out what's going on.
hope you won't go light on him -- that whole family's no good, if you ask me.
I'll talk to him.
You're a good man, Shane. Bet you're a hell of a fighter on the mats, huh? (Shane ignores him, and keeps walking.) Maybe sometime we oughta strap up, we'll give these boys a treat.
Another time, maybe...
It's a date then. I'll show you a couple moves. I promise I won't hurt you.
See that? You never know when your adversary is going to strike!
Did you kick me in the back? Is there a footprint on my jacket?
Come on Frogman! Don't be a sissy!
Wait Todd, I want to talk to you...
Smart kid.
Zoe, you're in charge. If anyone gets within forty clicks of the perimeter, signal me. Keep all doors sealed, do your homework, preheat the oven, and make sure Lulu brushes her teeth!
You want in or out?
Alright. All my Nazis are finally here. Okay, I want all of you at attention.
And on stage left -  VON TRAPPS! I need my Von Trapps!
Okeydokey. Starting from where we left off Gimme Rolf and Liesl -- let's give You are Sixteen a run up der flagpole...
You wait little girl, on an empty stage/for fate to turn the light on/your life little girl, is an empty page/that men will want to write on...
To write on...
You are sixteen, going on seventeen...
Baby Jesus, have I done some unspeakable evil that I deserve to be saddled with the world's worst production of Sound of Music?  We open in a week. The set's not finished... The cast is a bunch of clumsy goats -- every kick ball change would make Bob Fosse dig himself out of the earth, so he could have a heart attack again.
I'm sorry... I'll get it right.
None of you will ever get it right! Which is why, I quit.
And with that, he exits stage right... end scene.
You gonna fix him?
No. My hands are freezing.
I'm not going to quit. I hate wresting...
AT EASE.  Would you listen, just once? Look, I don't know a hell of a lot about this kinda stuff, but... You're good. A lot to learn, but with hard work, discipline -- you could make a go of this.
... but what about Murney?
That guy's an idiot.
"Sound of Music" is a great show. My dad took me to see it when I was a kid.
You don't seem like the musical type.
Come on. Julie Andrews was hot.
What if... girls'll think I'm... weird or something?
You know what girls think is weird? Wrestling. Men in leotards pinning each other to the floor? I've never understood that. Chicks dig guys who can dance.
Doesn't matter now anyway... show's off... it's over.
COMPANY -- CENTER STAGE!
DO YOU, OR DO YOU NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO PERFORM THIS MUSICAL?
We don't have a director...
No director? I have directed rescue missions in Afghanistan! I've directed numerous snatch and grabs in countries who's names you are not allowed to know. I have choreographed multi-pronged amphibious landings and stealth air attacks!  Do you think I have the stomach to whip this production into shape, or not?
Yes.
YES WHAT?
YESSIR.
... What's up?
 Nothing... It's stupid... Scott. I called him in his room, another girl picked up the phone. I know it's no big deal. I don't know why I let it get to me.
I don't see what you see in this guy.
It's just nice to think someone's thinking about you, you know? SHANE  It won't happen again.
... No wait! ...What are you gonna do? You're not gonna hurt him are you? Promise you won't touch him.
Okay. I promise. I won't touch him.
Tell me a story.
Okay. Let's see. Once there was a family of Elves. 
One day, the little Elf family -- Uh. Went into the magic forest. To find a secret gnome... facility, where gnomes where turning mushrooms into... Uranium. The elves had to go in and take it out.
Why?
They were ordered to. By the Elf Unit commander at Elf station bravo. So -- they waited for cloud cover, and they came in from the north...
The Elf Team decided on an L Ambush -- so three elves formed a base leg and laid down a heavy suppressive fire on the gnomes while the others maneuvered around to the right flank and walked through finishing off anything left alive... I mean standing...                    D ISSOLVE TO:
... And not one Elf got left behind that day. We got `em all. Even, the teeniest little elf of all -- Rodriquez.
You have to do the Panda Dance... or he won't stop.
Oh, c'mon... I can't remember that thing.
I'll write it down for you...
When you're down and low, lower than the floor. And you ain't got a chance. Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Panda Dance...
You have to do the dance. Like dad used to do. He made it up for him.
Just hop three times like a kangaroo -- Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do.
Take three steps forward and one step back...
What are you looking at?
Today you drive.
But -- I can't even pass driver's Ed.
Exactly.
Have you given a driving lesson before?
ot in a car, no... but it's a lot like a Bradley Assault Vehicle.
Especially when Zoe's driving.
Do you know what causes most accidents? ttention span. The most important thing is that you keep an absolute focus on...
THE ROAD! Don't look at me...
What?!?
You wanna drive?
No. Keep going. I trust you.
Good. Next lesson, 1500 hours.
Ha ha ha. Very funny. hey head into the school.   Shane spots something.
I know 437 ways to hurt a man without touching him. Broken promises lead to broken legs. Do we understand each other?
CHILDREN... STOP RUNNING!!
 Now... WALK! DOUBLE TIME.
Wow.   I'm glad I never had you for a CO.
 I've noticed improvement in your troops lately, too. Noon and none of them have been called to my office. It's a miracle. he sits beside him, and offers him a milk.
Buy you a drink, sailor?
Thanks.
You look nice today.
This old thing? Well, you never know who you're going to run into.
... Love it when he does that.
I've had it. I just caught this boy dancing under the bleachers like some kind of Bavarian fruitcake.
I want this freak outta my school and into treatment. Somebody needs to give this punk a talking to...
Hey. I'm right here. Talk. veryone is shocked that Todd talked back. A hushed whisper goes through the cafeteria. Murney turns around.
You got something to say? Boy?
Yeah. Yeah I do. I quit, Murney.
Winners never quit, boy. What're you so scared of, Freak?
I am not scared. I... I want to sing.
I'm in Sound of Music. It opens Friday...
A musical? You're blowing off wrestling for a musical?  This is what happens when there's no man in the house.
There is a man in my house -- me. (Murney turns:) Let's get one thing clear. I'm not quitting cause I hate wresting. I'm quitting because you're a bad coach. You suck. The whole team wants to quit. I'm the only one with the guts to do it. urney looks over at the Team. They look to the ground sheepishly, Todd's telling the truth. Murney looks around, humiliated, furious --
So -- you're a tough guy now?
Stay out of this, baby sitter!
You said you wanted to wrestle. You win. Let's do it.
After school. The Gym. Your ass is mine.
on, you're about to enter Murney's house of pain.
I'll be sure to lock up when I'm through.
Pinned!
Is he okay?
Dislocated nerve, that's all. He'll be fine in  two months.
That was awesome.
 Let's go, Todd. I got my troops waiting.
If you're ever lost in the woods, the first thing you have to do is find a source of drinking water! And make sure it's potable. If you're not sure, boil it for thirty minutes!
You have to eat, right? Well let me tell you you're not gonna find Girl Scout cookies out here.
We're Brownies.
No brownies   either. A lot of roots are edible. So    is some tree bark. When I HALO'd into   Rwanda, I lived off the underground   fern stem for three weeks!
Insects. They look nasty but they're full of nutrients that may save your life.
He's eating Roly-Polies!
 Wots of pwotien!
Okay -- we'll put Von Trapps here, here, and... here at the top of the stairs. Now the Nazis are gonna come in, this way -- and the Von Trapp is set...
... your life little girl, is an empty page/that men will want to write on... odd tries the spinning kick, but blows it, landing hard. Shane blows a WHISTLE.
Why don't we just let the Nazis win tonight -- huh? Now. From the top -- think of yourself as a gazelle prancing over the plains. Graceful.
Gazelle.   Prancing. Graceful.   Again.
Don't touch that dial sleep for a while -- HEAAAY! And say good night, Peter Panda.
Good night, Peter.
 Good night, daddy.
I'm not your daddy, Peter. But sweet dreams.
Brown...
Go away and we won't hurt you.
Uh oh. You're gonna have to pay for that.
That's my troop.
From now on, you do things our way -- no highway option!
I don't care what has been said, Brownies rock! Full speed ahead! Give me guff, I'm in your face! Brownies rule the human race!
Sound off!
One two! Three four! One TWO THREE FOUR!
West Side Story auditions in two weeks...
It's all in the wrist...
Don't worry.    I'm not gonna jump.
What's wrong... Scott?
o. Scott's fine. I don't know what you did, but he's really straightened up. Flowers, phone calls. ...I've never been in love like this before.
How long you been together?
A month...
That's longer than any relationship I've ever had.
You're okay, Shane. I'm not used to anyone giving me the benefit of the doubt. My teachers don't trust me. Mom doesn't. My dad didn't care about us, he was never here...
 Hey. Your father cared about you very deeply. He told me you were the greatest things in his life. That what's bothering you? Cause -- we can talk about it, if you want.
I miss him so much...
This was my dad's. He was the only family I ever had. Mom left when I was little, cause dad was always gone. Two years in... an indisclosable locale. Another six in... Another indisclosable locale. I didn't really have a home, so I went to military school -- then one day my mom got the letter. No more dad.
I always wanted to be just like him. I'm starting to realize, I never really knew him. I don't know if I'm like him or not.
That's horrible, Shane.
The hardest part was living without any details...why? How? Where? I always wondered if he thought about me.
Me too.   So how did you get through it?
You could say I just shut down my emotions. I turned off all feelings and dedicated myself to becoming the perfect soldier.
I never even got to say good bye.
The red tape is cleared up, we're on the first plane in the morning.
Mommy's coming home! Mommy's coming home!
When?
Tomorrow morning!
Mama!
Just another assignment. No reason for personal attachments.
Hey Gary, your wings aren't clipped. How come you don't fly away?  
I guess you've got it good.    Kids to play with. Three squares a day.
All quiet on the western front. I guess I better fix that Playroom window. hane rises.
What happened, Gary?
What do you suppose this is?
Sir! Excellent news. I think I found GHOST.
... Do you have it?
No. It's in a steel vault. I've been trying all night, can't crack it, sir.
 Good! Good work. Okay, don't do anything further. We'll be there shortly -- don't do anything `til I get there.
GHOST.
One things for sure. After we turn this in to my CO, whoever's been bothering you guys won't be bothering you anymore.
What's wrong, Lulu? You should be happy.
But, Shane -- does that mean you'll have to go?
You guys better get ready.    Your mom should be home soon.
I had a fight with Zoe when I left, so they probably trashed the place...
What's wrong?
 ... with songs they have sung, for a thousand years...
Welcome home, mom.
Captain.
 Good job, Lieutenant.
I'm really proud of you, Shane. I'm giving you your choice of assignment, anywhere you want. You just name it.
That's kind of you, Sir... pause) But I'll have to think about it.
Sir, all I've never known is the military. At nine years old my father put me in cadet school and from there I never looked back. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade it for anything and I have no regrets...
I should hope not.
But being with these kids has made me feel like there's more to life than taking out your enemy. And I think I want to explore that some more.
PUT YOUR HANDS UP!!
Give US THE KEY!
Mr. and Mrs. Chun?     They checked out-
ands up!
NOW!
 You promised us GHOST months ago!
I'm sorry, Mr. Chun. There were delays...
SHANE!!
He won't be baby-sitting you anymore.
I trusted you. Charles trusted you. So did the Department of Defense.
North Korea pays better.  Keep an eye on them. You -- with me.
You bring your stethoscope?
No.   But I've got some C4.
Charles never made things easy.
Just... had eyebrows... done.
Think I'm stupid? Now stop bothering me.
Now Peter!
Let's GO!
Hi ya!
That's cute.
That stuff doesn't hurt.
AGGGH!
Keep going!     RUN! Go GET HELP!!!
Hurry!   C'mon! Buckle up!!
They're headed for the car!
Relax -- I've got the keys, they're not going anywhere...
ARGHH!
Omigod!   What are we doing??!
Let's look for a cop!
How does it work?
How does what work?
Don't play dumb. It's getting old. I want to know how to get through the booby traps. What's the code?
I don't know any code -- Charles didn't tell me about the room...
If I knew Charles had hidden it so well, I wouldn't have killed him so soon. Don't make me kill you too.
Mr. Bill, my husband has question:
I have a clean shot at their tires. It's risky, they might wreck...
... Do it.
NO!
Bill, don't hurt the kids.
I know the code. I'll get you in... just please don't hurt anyone.
Change of plan. Bring them back unharmed.
What's taking you?
Don't wait for me!
Now!
Aah!     HEY --
Wheee!
Anybody got any perfume?          Hair spray... breath freshener...
Zoe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler!
The key is the kid's names. Watch.
You think this is a game?! SHANE But... That was the code! I swear! I saw Plummer use it on his briefcase.
Code or no code, go get it -- now.
You can't make him do this -- He doesn't have a chance.
 Haven't got a chance.
 ... When you're down and low, lower than the floor. And you haven't got a chance. Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Peter Panda Dance.
Just hop three times like a kangaroo --
Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do.
Three steps forward and one step back.
QUICK LIKE A TURTLE LIE ON YOUR BACK!
Look out Zoe! Rollers!
Come on. Use the gas, not the brake, 5-0.
I'd say you could lose your license -- but you haven't got one!
People are trying to kill us. They have my mom, and our bodyguard -- you have to follow me!
Just pull over!
Fine. Don't follow me!
That Baloney Bandit struck again. I accept full responsibility. My intelligence proved to be faulty, but if I had more resources...
 I told you not to pass her in Driver's Ed.
Wriggle like a snake `til you can't no more. Then better jump quick, like there ain't no floor.
 Almost done, almost done... "Just hold your breath, and jump to the left."
And that's the Peter Panda Dance.
Thank you, Shane. You were always my best man. I knew you'd figure it out.
You know, if you're willing to join up, I'd be happy to cut you in on the proceeds. What do you say -- we make a good team?
I was devoted to you, sir. And you betrayed all of that. All that we stand for.
I'll take that as a "no."
... I think you better open it.
Wait. That's just what you want isn't it?
You open it.
Oh come on. I walked the floor first.
There will be no mercy.
None requested.
AAAAAA!
You're a... terrible neighbor.
Shane!   Watch out!
Any last words?
... Say, good night, Peter Panda!
Zoe! You're going too fast!! You're not gonna have enough time to stop-
Hey, I'M the one in Driver's Ed!    I think I know what I'm doing!!
... GHOST.
Thank you Shane. It's finally over. Now we can go back to our peaceful...
FREEZE! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!
Whoa, WHOA!    What are you doing to these kids??
FREEZE. HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.
But, officer...
I said FREEZE. Zoe, you're in a lot of trouble... Reckless endangerment! Driving without a license. Numerous, uh... trafficS violations --
 These kids are heroes. They just aided in exposing a high-level espionage ring. I suggest you call the FBI. Now.
You expect me to believe any of that?
EVERYBODY!   HIT THE GROUND!!!
I WANT THE GHOST, TEN MILLION DOLLARS, AND A DIRECT FLIGHT TO PYONGYANG!
Ya!!
I think I'll call the FBI.
Mr. Wolfe... that was nice work.   You're a one-man battalion.
Just doing my job.
The Bureau is always looking for good men. Do you have a card or something?
Do you have to wear that thing in your ear all the time?
Yes.
Does it itch?
Yes...
If you're reading this, then Julie found the key. Julie, Tyler, Peter, Zoe, Todd, Lulu -- I want to say: I love you more than anything. I always have.
So. What happens now? You'll be stationed somewhere else, right? I guess there's no more reason for you to stick around here.
Well. I'm kinda, re-conning the situation, here... And to tell the truth. I don't see anything but reasons to stay. RINCIPAL CLAIRE So... What's the next move?
... I don't know. I'm on dry land. You're the superior office. You tell me.
Well. Summer's almost here. What if you and me did a little amphibious recon mission. On, say -- Maui?
Sir yes sir.
This is it. Your work here is through. Guess you have to go now...
Ah, come here you.
But...
He would've wanted me to give it to someone I care about. Like he did. Thank you. For everything. ETER Love you, Shane.
Your dad would be so proud.
Shane, we're never gonna see you again!
What are you talking about?      I'm gonna see you Friday night.
What's Friday night?
Tonight is the night we trained for, and failure is not an option! No detail is too small! We are the BEST! Remember your lines, hit your marks, and stay in character! I expect perfection! 
 Now let's break a leg.
YESSS!  Huu-ah!
