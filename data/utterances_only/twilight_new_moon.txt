"These violent delights have violent ends..."
BELLA "... And in their triumph die, like fire and powder..."
"... Which, as they kiss, consume..."
Edward!
Edward!
... Gran?
Bella... She spins to the voice behind her to SEE --
Stop - she'll see!
Oh my God.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday, Bells.
Dad, we agreed, no gifts.
At least mine's not wrapped.
Okay, this is actually kind of great. Thanks, Dad.
 Goes with this one from your mom. We coordinated - well, she coordinated me.
To put your pictures in, record your senior year -- man, senior year. How'd you get so old so fast?
Not that old.
I don't know. Is that a wrinkle?
I was kidding.
So not funny, Dad.
It was just a dream... but also my worst nightmare.
Wherefore art thou, Bella?
You finish the Shakespeare assignment?
He means will you finish his assignment? MIKE No, I don't -- okay I do.
I can help you with it -- but first --  I need a picture. My mom's expecting a scrapbook full of memories.
 I take `em, I don't pose for `em.
You do today.
You'll photoshop my nose if it looks big, right?
Don't worry, I'm in the picture; no one will be looking at you guys.
 Oh good. Cullen's here.
 Yay.
Check ya later.
Happy birthday.
Don't remind me.
Your birth is definitely a day to celebrate.
Not for me.
Eighteen is a little early to be worrying about your age.
It's one year older than you.
Bella, I'm ninety.
True. Maybe I should be creeped out that I'm dating such an old guy.
 Yes, it's the age that's creepy, not the fact that you're dating a vampire.
Class.
Right.   Class.
Someone wants you.
Bella! JACOB BLACK, 16, jogs up, carrying a used car part, long, black ponytail wagging. He looks 18 due to his tall, muscular body, but the gregarious Jacob is a little klutzy, still catching up to his growth spurt. He nods to Edward, who moves off to the side but eyes them.
God, Jacob, what are they feeding you on that rez, steroids? You're huge.
Wouldn't seem so drastic if you came around more.
I will, soon. But isn't your school, like, ten miles that way?
 Just here buying this for the Rabbit. I'm almost done with the rebuild. Gotta come take a ride when it's done.  Oh, and hey, happy birthday. Your dad told my dad. So...
I saw it the other day and thought of you - it catches bad dreams.
This, I need. It's great.
The bell's about to ring.
Ooh, look at you, all psychic.
I don't have that particular gift. But I can read a watch. I'm clever that way.
Bye, Jake, and thank you.
How come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
He's just a friend.
"Friends" don't spend two weeks looking for the perfect dreamcatcher.
Stop reading his mind if he bothers you so much.
Little hard to tune out.
Happy --
Shh!
-- birthday.
Alice, didn't I say no gifts?
You did. I didn't. I've already seen you open it and guess what? You love it.
You had a vision about my birthday.
And about the green dress you'll be wearing to your party tonight. Great color on you.
... My party?
Please?     It'll be fun.
 I... guess I can deal --
 -- Great! See ya at seven!
Wait, Jasper, no fair with the mood control.
Vampires.    You can't trust them.
Arms, take your last embrace, and lips, O you, the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss...
Here's to my love!  O true apothecary!    Thy drugs are quick.
I hate being... celebrated.
Come on, the last real birthday any of us had was Emmett's - I think Bing Crosby was on top of the charts.  You'll be helping us feel normal for a night.
There are worse tragedies than a birthday. Look at Romeo. He's responsible for his wife's death. Who could live with that?  ... Though I do envy him one thing.
 Juliet's alright... if you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
Not the girl - the suicide.  Nearly impossible for my kind. But humans, a little poison, dagger to the heart. There are so many options.
 Why would you even think about that?
 I considered it. Once.      When James had you trapped.
I didn't know if I'd find you in time. If I'd gotten you killed --
It wouldn't have been your fault --
Either way, I had a plan.
What plan?
There are... ways for us. At least one way. I would have gone to Italy, provoked the Volturi...
The who?
Is there something you'd like to share with the class, Edward?
 Certainly not. But I apologize for being a distraction. Perhaps you should rewind to act five, scene one, line twenty-eight eighty-nine --  "If you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight."
Eyes on the screen, people.
The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family...
The closest thing my world has to royalty...
Francesco Solimena painted this; he often depicted the Volturi as Gods.
Is that... Carlisle?
Yes. He lived with them for a few decades. He describes them as very refined - for killers.
The Volturi are also what you might call enforcers.
Of what? EDWARD The only rule they have: to keep secret the existence of our kind.
We don't make spectacles of ourselves, or kill conspicuously, unless we want to die.
Don't even -- talk about that. You can't let anyone hurt you. The Volturi or anyone else.
 Who else would hurt me?
You said there were more dangerous things out there than you. And I know you have at least one enemy --
You said she'd come after you for killing her mate.
Victoria? Yes, some day. But Alice will see her coming. And she won't win.
I hate that I can't protect you.
That was me being serious.
 I know. But you do protect me...  From boredom...  And loneliness...  You give me a reason to stay... un- dead. But it's... my job; to protect you...
... from everyone but my sister.
It's time it's time it's time!
Sorry about all this.   We tried to rein Alice in.
Like that's even possible.   Happy birthday, Bella.
 Found it in your bag.   Mind?
Dating an older woman.    Hot.
What?
It's a necklace. Alice picked it out.
 Show me the love!
For your scrapbook.    Now open your presents!
Alice, I'm the only one who even eats cake. That thing could feed fifty.
Hope you're hungry.    Here, this one's from Emmett. The others crowd around... Jasper somewhat away. Bella, no fan of being the center of attention, opens the gift to find an empty car-radio box.
Um... thanks?
Already installed it in your truck.
Finally, a decent sound system in that piece of --
No hating on the truck.     Thank you, Emmett.
Open mine.
Ouch - paper cut.
 Jaz... shhh --
Emmett, get Jasper out of here.  Emmett.
I'm sorry, I... can't...
I'll have to stitch this up.
I'll carry her to the kitchen.
I'll take care of her, Edward.  Check on Jasper. Go.
I sure can kill a party.
It's not your fault. Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us.
Seems like you're the only one it doesn't effect.
Centuries of practice.
Did you ever think of... living differently?
I enjoy   my work too much. Helping people,   saving lives. I'm hoping there's   a point to my existence, even if I am   damned.
Damned?    You're not damned.
Then you and I agree. But Edward doesn't believe there's an afterlife for our kind.  He thinks we've lost our souls.
 That's why he won't... He thinks he'd be damning me.
If you believed as he did, would you risk it?
Say something. EDWARD What do you want me to say?
That I'm a klutz. That I should have been more careful --
You got a paper cut. Normal people get paper cuts. And a normal boyfriend wouldn't have flung you into a stack of plates. A normal boyfriend wouldn't have had to fight the urge to kill you --
Stop.   I don't want normal, I want you.
You can't protect me from everything - something's going to separate us -- accident, illness, old age... as long as I'm human... EDWARD  That's your solution?   My ending your life?
Your giving me forever.
Carlisle told me how you feel, about my soul, but I don't believe that --
You should go in. It's late.
I'll leave my window open for you.
 I won't be coming back.   Not tonight.
Then... can I ask for one thing?   It's still my birthday.  Kiss me?
Edward.   You're here.
Walk with me?
We need to leave Forks.
What?   Why?
It's time. Carlisle's supposed to be ten years older than he looks; people will start noticing.
But... when?
Now.
I'll have to think of something to tell Charlie, but I can be ready --
Not you.   Us.
 What? -- no -- Edward, what happened with Jasper - that was nothing. EDWARD Nothing compared to what could happen. You don't belong in my world.
-- I belong with you --
-- You don't --
-- I'm coming --
I don't want you to come!
You don't... want me.
No.
I'd like to ask one favor though.
 Anything. EDWARD Don't do anything stupid or reckless -- do you understand?  ... for Charlie's sake. Just... take care of yourself.
I... yes... I will.
Don't worry. You're human. Time heals all wounds for your kind. Particularly if you're not reminded.
No, this is - don't do this.     Please. He sees she won't let go easily.    Takes a breath.       His face turns cold again.
Try to understand. Every second with you is about restraint. You're too fragile. I'm tired of pretending to be something I'm not. Reining myself in so I can be with a human.
Then take my soul. I don't care!        I don't want it without you --
 -- You're not good for me, Bella.
I've let it go on too long.     I'm sorry.
I promise, it will be like I never existed. Goodbye, Bella. And here, for the first time, we SEE how truly agonizing this really is for Edward. But Bella doesn't see.
-- Wait --
Edward?!
Move, Bella.
I'll call the Cullens again. Her note said she and Edward went for a walk.
They left town, Charlie. HARRY CLEARWATER Hospital said Doc Cullen got a big job somewhere else.
We'll find her, Charlie.
Charlie!
It's Sam Uley. He found her.
Thank you, Sam. Thank God.
What were you thinking, Baby?   Why were you out there?
He's... gone.
Dear Mom... I'm...  ... lost...
Edward took everything with him. Including my life. He promised it would be like he never existed...
... But I need to know he did.
It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest...
But the pain is my only reminder that he was real... that they all were...
I miss them. Especially Alice...
But I'm sure it's better for them, not having me around...
No.   We promised Edward.
But she won't do well without us. I get flashes of her, but they're unclear --
Forget her, let's drag Edward home.
He'll come back when he's ready. After Bella moves on.
Yes. When she's living her life, safe from danger --
 You mean safe from us.
 And when will that be?
Can you see him, Alice? They all turn to Alice... a beat. She closes her eyes, trying to get a lock on Edward -- PUSH IN ON ALICE as --
The only decision he's made...
... is to be alone...
Time passes. Every tick that goes by... aches...
Like the pulse of blood behind a bruise...
It's about time you got rid of those, Bob. Seen one too many bikers smeared on the highway.
Save the lecture, Chief. Soon as the garbage truck hauls `em off, you and my wife can rest easy.  Oh, hey, what's the word on that bear problem? Folks are saying they're huge.
 That's just... talk...
How you doin' there, Bella?
That's it.
That's what?
You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother. BELLA What?   Why?
I just - don't know what to do any more. You don't act like someone left you; more like someone died.
I'm not leaving Forks.
Bells, the bastard's not coming back.
It's not normal, this behavior. And frankly, it's scaring the hell outta me, and your mother.  Go to Jacksonville, Baby. Make some new friends.
I like my old friends.
You never even see them anymore.
I do, too. In fact, I'm... um... Jessica and I are going to Port Angeles tomorrow. Shopping.
 You hate shopping.
That's how good a friend I am.
 Alright. Shopping.
Hi Jessica, it's Bella...
... Yes, Bella Swan. Hey, any chance you feel like shopping tomorrow?
I don't get why are there so many zombie movies.
It's, like, a metaphor? For crass consumerism or something.
Not that you'd know anything about consuming. You didn't buy anything today.
I bought something.
Socks don't count. `Course, I was surprised you even called.
I've been kind of... out of it.
Kind of? I mean, at first I was worried. Then I'm like, okay, she's still bumming? It's not like I wasn't going through things, too. Like Mike deciding he wanted to "just be friends?" That was really hard and --
How `bout a ride, girls?
Move, Bella.
Come on.
I know them... I think...
Can we just go --
I want to see something.
Alright, we got a taker.
Turn around, Bella.     This is dangerous.
Stop.   Now.
... You're not them.
We'll be whoever you want, honey.
Ready for a thrill ride?
EDWARD Walk away.     Go.
I can break promises, too.
 ... Okay.
Bella!
... Wait
Stop - stop! - STOP!
Hey, I didn't force nothing on you.
What the hell is wrong with you?!
 I... saw something. JESSICA You.   Are insane. Or suicidal.
 The more dangerous... the more real it was.
So, what, you're like an adrenaline junky now? Go hang-gliding or bungie- jumping. Don't be a complete freak.
He wasn't real. I knew that. I didn't care. I needed to see him. If danger's what it took, that's what I'd find.
Bella!
`Bout time you came by.
I brought you something.
Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.
I rescued them from the dump. They'd cost more than they're worth to fix... unless one had a mechanic-type friend. JACOB Me, being the mechanic-type friend?  Since when are you into motorcycles?
Recently.
 The parts alone will be pricey.
I have a college fund I can dig into.
Charlie's gonna love that.
Charlie won't know.
Wow. Lying to Dad. Blowing through college money. Repairing dangerous machines - that I'm guessing you'll want to ride?
I really get it if you think this is stupid and reckless. JACOB Oh it's totally stupid and reckless.  When do we start?
We're going the wrong way.
Who cares?   Enjoy the scenery.
 And the West Nile virus.
You hear that?
If I knew you were such a wuss, I'd have brought my grandma.
Could be one of those giant bears. NATE There are no giant --
What the hell is that?!
I don't know!
Think it's gone?
Nate?   Nate!?
If we're going to be working on this every day, we should probably include some homework. Don't want the Dads to think I'm a bad influence on you.
You influence me?     Please.
I am older than you.
Age ain't nothin' but a number.
And I convinced you to secretly build us two-wheeled death machines.
 God, you're right, you're like Satan -- QUIL Yo, Jake, you in there?
It's cool, it's just my boys.
Hey, Jake --
Hey. This is Bella.         Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
So the bike building story is true.
Taught him everything he knows.
What about the part where you're his girlfriend? BELLA Oh, we're just friends.
Ooh.    Burn.
 I said she's a girl and a friend.
Embry, you remember him making that distinction?
Nope.
So I guess you guys have girlfriends. JACOB  Right. Quil took his cousin to prom.
Yeah, that's still a riot. You want funny, Black? I'll give you funny.
I got five bucks on Quil.
You're on.
I never forgot my reason for doing what I was doing... Jacob clowns for Bella's amusement, pretends to skewer himself with a pipe. She laughs.
But being with Jacob was a bigger perk than I expected...
Quil keeps asking to come over. I think he likes you a little too much.
Tell him I'm not into the cougar thing.
What is it with you and age? I mean, that Cullen guy was young, didn't seem to... bother you.
Not even Jacob could keep away the nightmares...
... the terror, the loneliness.
You're alright, Bells.   You're okay.
This thing's not working very well.
It's... not as bad as it was.
Yeah right.  I know what it's like, you know. When your mom left me. I had a hell of a time. Imagined doing all kinds of crazy things, just to stop the pain.
But hanging out with Jacob seems to help get your mind off... things.
He's been keeping me afloat.
That's good. He's a good guy.
We got lucky at the dump. You know how much a new crankshaft goes for?
Sure, I spend all my free time on crankshaft-dot-com.
I think that's a porn site.  These bikes are gonna be rolling soon. Where should we ride first?
Someplace sunny.
Like there's any place sunny around here.
I know a place above the cloud line --
Where is it?
Actually, it's... too hard to get to.
So we'll find our sunny spot, right?
Isn't that... Sam Uley?
 And his cult.
Oh my God!   Stop them! --
They're not really fighting, Bella. They're cliff diving.
What, on purpose?
Scary as hell, but a total rush.
Most of us jump from lower down.
Think I could?
Man, first motorcycles, now cliff diving?
You said it was a rush.
Maybe on a warmer day. And not from the top. We'll leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
You don't like them.
They think they run this place.   Acting all bad ass, calling themselves "protectors."
What are they protecting?
The tribe, the land, their right to be jerks. Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids; now look at him.
That's Embry? I didn't recognize him. What happened to him?
He missed some school - then, out of nowhere, he's following Sam around. Same thing happened with Paul and Jared. They weren't even friends, now Sam owns them.  Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something; it's kinda freaking me out.
Maybe you should just avoid them.
I try but...
Hey.   If it gets worse, we'll go to my Dad.   Or you can come stay with us.
Thanks.  If this is how you're going to react, I'll freak out more often.
I'll kill Tyler if he gave me his flu.
It's going around. My sister was so sick she couldn't come on our hike this weekend... so she didn't see it.
 Ang, maybe you should keep that to yourself --
We saw something, Eric.
I believe you. JESSICA No he doesn't. He's just trying to get lucky.
 Is that an option?
 It was jet black and huge; on all fours it was still taller than a person. A bear maybe.
Or Big Foot.
Or an alien. Lucky you didn't get probed.
 ... We saw it.
You're not the only one. Everyone stares.    Did Bella just speak?
My dad's been getting reports at the sheriff's station. A couple hikers went missing. People are scared.
I did hear some guy talking about it at the store.
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.
ECU ON JACOB AND BELLA'S FACES
You look scared.
I'm not.
Brake?  Clutch?  Right. Gas?  You ready?
Slowly... release the clutch.
Stop.
You okay?   Bruises, breaks -- ?
I'm going again.
I'm not sure that's a good -- Bella quickly rises and hops back on.
Guess we're going again. Now what are you going to do with the clutch?
Release it.    Slowly.
 I don't -- how do I turn!?
Bank it!   Bank - hit the brake!
What, are you training for the X-games?
I want to go again.
Forget it. I'm revoking your motorcycle privileges. Man, look at your head.
God, I'm sorry. JACOB You're apologizing for bleeding?
It doesn't... bother you?
It's just blood, Bella.
What are you staring at?
Just, you're actually... good looking.
How hard did you hit your head?
 Oh I - yeah.
Jake, you're hot.
Upgraded from good looking?
No, temperature hot.  You're burning up.
I feel fine.
What?   I can't hold your hand? BELLA It just... means something else to you than it does to me.
One, that's my problem. But two... we have fun, you think I'm hot --
Good looking.
I know you like me.
More than anyone.    But... that's all.
Because of Cullen?
Look, I know what he did to you. I can see it in your face every time his name comes up. But you need to know - I would never, ever do that to you. I promise I will never hurt you. You can count on me. BELLA I already do. You don't know how much. You're my best friend but... I don't think my feelings will change.
I'm sorry. I should've said something right from the start --
No. That's not -- I just feel... weird.
I told you, you have a fever. Probably that flu everyone has.
It doesn't... feel like flu.    I don't know what it is.
Hey Jake. Just checking to see how you're doing. And to say I'm sorry, about, you know... how I feel and... hope the flu passes fast. Call me.
Hi Jake. Your dad said you have mono. He won't let me visit but... would you call me?
Me again.   I just... need to hear your voice...
Jacob.   Please. Call me.
Harry and I will be back by three --
It's mono, Bells.
He's too sick to even call?
You just gotta wait it out.  You know, I don't have to go fishing...
 No, go. I'll call Jess or someone.
Good. But stay here or at Jess's. No hikes or anything. We're issuing a warning about those bears.
I was more afraid of the hole in my chest than I was of bears. Without Jacob, I needed Edward more than ever...
... I needed to know he existed. There was only one place I might find him, or the feeling of him...
Laurent?
Bella.
Laurent!
I must admit, I didn't expect to find you here.
I live here. But you - I thought you were in Alaska with Carlisle's friend.
Tanya, I was. It was kind of him to arrange, given my association with James and Victoria, "The Enemy."
You tried to help us.
I went to visit the Cullens, but their house is empty. I'm surprised they left you behind. Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?
Um... something like that.
Do the Cullens visit often?
Lie.
Absolutely.    All the time.
Lie better.
I'll tell them you stopped by.
Will they be able to reach you in Alaska?
I don't think so. Tanya's "vegetarian" family was pleasant enough. But the dietary restrictions were difficult - living on nothing but animals.
 Tell me Bella. Do you ever feel compelled to... cheat?
But that's not why I left. I came back here as a favor to Victoria.
... You're still friends.
 More or less. She asked me to get the lay of the land with the Cullens. Because, well... I'm afraid Victoria is quite put out with you.
That's... too bad.
Yes. She feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate, given he killed hers. Eye for an eye, mate for a mate.
Threaten him.
Edward will know who did it.   He'll come after both of you.
I don't think he will. After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected?  Victoria sent me here for information. She won't be happy about my killing you. BELLA No, Laurent...
 No, no, no. Don't be upset. I'm doing you a kindness. Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully - whereas I'll make it very quick.  And you smell so... mouth watering.
 Edward. I love you. Laurent is milliseconds from biting - then abruptly, his expression changes. He sees something in the forest behind Bella - and it terrifies him.
I... don't believe it.
Don't.   Move.
Bella?   What's wrong?
They're not giant bears -- I saw them. Up in a meadow --
Damn it, I told you not to go into the woods!
What did you see, Bella?
Wolves.   They're wolves, Dad.
BELLA Five of them. The size of - of cars. I swear. They went after -- something - - and I ran.
Harry, can you get some men from the rez?
Sure.   Yeah. I'll just --
 Jerry? Put a hunting party together -- tranq guns, large caliber shotguns -- there's something dangerous out there. BELLA Something dangerous. Victoria.
If she came after me, Charlie would try to protect me -- and he'd die.
I've gotta go to the station.
Good! -- That's good.
You okay here? You want to come with?
Actually, I -- need to see a friend.
Hi, Billy.   I know Jacob's sick but --
He's out with friends. BELLA  Oh.
I'll let him know you came by.
Wait -- he's got mono, right?    That's what you told my dad.
 You should go on home, Bella.
You cut your hair.
Go away.
What happened to you?
 I can help.
Sam got to you. What did he do?
Sam's trying to help me, don't blame him.
Then who? JACOB  How `bout those filthy, reeking bloodsuckers you love? The Cullens.
 I... don't know what you're --
You know exactly what I'm talking about.
The Cullens are long gone.    How are they to blame?
They started all this by existing. Goddamn leeches --
Jacob.
I can't be friends with you anymore. BELLA Jake, I know I hurt you. I should have been more up-front but -- I needed you, I still do. I don't know what that means yet, but if you give me time --
Stop.    Don't. It's not you --
-- "It's not you, it's me?"     God.
It's true.   I'm not... good.
You're wrong --
It doesn't matter.    This is over -- BELLA I can't take losing my best friend, too.
You already have --
Don't say that -- you promised --
Go home, Bella. Don't come back.
Billy called, said you and Jacob had a fight. But, hey, you guys will work it out, I'm sure of it.
I'm... going to change.
Why!?
 Bella! Ouch - damn it; open the window.
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of the way.
No! He launches himself THROUGH the window with great agility --
I pictured your room more... cluttered.
Why are you here?
I had to talk to you.   Alone.
To kick me in the gut again? It was bad before, but you made it so much worse.
I know. And I want to explain. But... I can't.
Then leave.
You're done with me, remember?   Get. Out!
Bella, I literally can't explain...
I broke my promise not to hurt you, I know. But I'm trying to keep it now. I need you to understand... even if you don't want to see me when you find out --
Find what out? He starts to speak -- but can't.   It's agonizing.   She sees he's in pain. Is concerned.
What's wrong?
I can't do it.
Yes, you can. I'll help you. We can... we can leave. Leave home, leave Sam.
It's not something I can run away from.  I would run with you though. If I could.  Wait. Wait, I already -- I told you. You know this -- you can guess.
I don't want to play games with you --
You have to! I can't tell you, but if you remember - it was that day I ran into you at the beach. I told you a story -- come on! I told you a story... about?
... about... "The Cold Ones?" You said it was a stupid tribal myth.
 Was it? Are the Cold Ones a myth?
What else did I say?
That... the tribe made a treaty with them. They can't come onto your land and... I don't know, I don't remember.
Try, Bella. BELLA You have to give me more. Tell me where to look. Is there something I should see -- ?
No, that's too dangerous --
I'll take the risk.    Jacob, show me.
Where was the last place you saw me... the way I used to be?
The motorcycles - that clearing in the woods. He nods slowly, then turns to go.    She stops him.
Don't go. There are dangerous things out there; more than you know.
If I was going to lose someone else, I needed to know why.
What the hell have you done?!
I didn't tell her.   You'd know if I did.
She's here, isn't she?
Bella, there's nothing to see here. You should go home.
Not until I know what you did to Jacob.
 What we did?!
Both of you, calm down --
Sam, she knows things about the bloodsuckers. She's been on the inside. She can help --
Like a leech lover's gonna help us.
Watch what you call her.
Get a grip, guys --
It's alright, Jacob, I'll go --
All you care about is her -- SAM  Paul, back off.
-- and she doesn't give a crap about you --
Jacob.
Too late.
Bella, get back! Paul FALLS FORWARD but halfway to the ground there's a loud RIPPING noise and Paul explodes in silver-gray fur, becoming a massive wolf crouched and ready to spring!
Run, Jacob! --
Jake, no!   Stop -- !
Take Bella to Emily's place.
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.
 Pay up. She didn't puke.
Told you she was tough.     She does run with bloodsuckers.
Wait. We should go back, make sure Jacob's okay.
I hope Paul gets some teeth in him. Serve him right.
No way. Jake's a natural. You see him phase on the fly? I gotta fiver says Paul doesn't touch him.
Easy money.    Paul's been at it longer.
Come on in.    We won't bite.
Speak for yourself. Bella warily climbs out of the car, joins them.     Embry pauses at the door --
Oh, hey, about Emily - Sam's fiance - just try not to stare. It bugs Sam.
Why would I stare? --
You guys hungry? Like I have to ask... Emily looks toward them now -- REVEALING the other side of her face: A scar runs from hairline to chin, three red lines that pull down her eye and twist her mouth.
Who's this?
Bella Swan.    Who else?
So you're the vampire girl.
And you're a... you're all...
Werewolves? I'm just engaged to one. But these animals --  Save some for your brothers.
Leave it to Jacob to get around Sam's gag order. BELLA He didn't say anything, or... couldn't.
That's a wolf thing. Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want to or not --
How `bout you shut up now, Embry?
You know Jacob's gonna fill her in.
Yeah, I know every stupid thought he has.  Wanna know what he thinks of you?
Like you need special powers to know that.
 It's another wolf thing. We hear each other's thoughts. Good for hunting. Embarrassing for everything else.
Freaking out yet?
 You're not the first -- mind reader I've met.
 Jake's right. You are good with the weird.
But I don't get -- how?   Why? --
-- Because there are bad things here. She spins - Sam is now standing behind her, the front door open behind him.
And they're getting worse.
Hey, Em.
Ha!   Pay up. As Jared reluctantly hands Embry five bucks, Jacob's eyes find Bella's. He nods solemnly to the door; we should talk.
You just have to... stop.
It's not a life-style choice.   It's in my DNA.
Killing is in your DNA?
Man, I thought maybe you wouldn't be such a hypocrite -- what, I'm not the right kind of monster for you? Can't measure up to your bloodsucking friends --
 Hey, they manage to survive without hurting innocent people.
Wait - innocent? -- so... you don't care that I morph into a giant dog. Just that I... kill people?
 "Just?" Those hikers' lives mean that little to you?
 Oh my God.
Bella -- Bella wait...  We're not killing hikers.   We're trying to protect them.
From what?
The only thing we do kill: Vampires.
 Vampires? Jake, no --
 Don't worry, we can't touch your precious Cullens - unless they bite someone and violate the Treaty --
That's not what I -- you can't fight vampires. They're too dangerous.
Please. We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.
You... killed Laurent? JACOB  ... He didn't seem like a friend.
No, God no.    But... how?
It's what we do, why we exist. A few "lucky guys" in the tribe have the gene. If a bloodsucker moves to town, our DNA kicks in, we reach the right age and the fever hits --
 "Mono."
I wish. Next thing I know, they're telling me, this is your life now. That future you saw for yourself? Gone.
It's bad, huh?
I just hate feeling... out of control. Like maybe Sam is right; you shouldn't be around me.
Like you could get rid of me.
You've seen Emily.
Sam lost it for a split second; Em was standing too close -- he's still messed up about it.  I don't want to be that kind of nightmare.
You're not like that. You save people, right? You saved me from Laurent.
Yeah, didn't mind taking him out. His red-headed girlfriend will be fun, too.
Victoria.     She's here?
We chased her all the way to the border the other night. But she won't stay gone. Keeps coming back -- if we knew what she was after...  ... What?
I know what she wants.      Me. SMASH TO:
James hated cars. He liked being close to the ground. But I'd steal one occasionally, to throw him off the scent... See, we played hide and seek sometimes. No one can hide like me --  -- but no one could seek like James.
What -- what are you -- ? VICTORIA Some games   lasted months... but we always got   hungry for each other.  So I'd let   him find me...
Michael?    Oh my God --
We never could get enough of each other...  We would have had forever to try.
Michael?!
James always loved a screamer.
Excellent. If the redhead's after Bella, we've got bait.
She is not bait.
I should leave town.
Victoria will follow you and make it harder for us to catch her.
No one can catch her.   She can escape anything.
Ooh.   She has special powers.
Some of them do.
Like... what? Bella?
The mind reader you said you knew. He was a suckhead? Can they all do that?
That would blow.
No, I -- shouldn't have - no.
She's still protecting them.
I don't know why. It's not like they stuck around to protect you --
Guys, back off.
Don't worry, we've got this place covered. She won't get near you or Charlie.
Hey, we should do something fun. Like... cliff diving, right?
I could use the rush.
Soon.   After we catch her.
You're here.
Bella.   Are you okay?
Yeah, I just... is Jacob here?   He wasn't at home...
He's with Jared and Embry, keeping an eye on things. I'm heading out soon. Should I tell him something?
You want to come in?
You got something, Harry?
Nope, nothin'.
Step back.
Stop this now, Bella.
You won't stay with me any other way.
Yes!
Breathe, Bella! C'mon!
Bella?   Can you hear me?
... Jake? She focuses, finally SEES Jacob hovering over her, relieved. Behind him stands Sam.
She'll be alright.
What the hell were you thinking?
I needed... to see... something.
What? The pearly gates?   If we hadn't heard you scream --
Get her home. I'm heading to the hospital. I'll meet you there.
Why would you jump? Didn't you notice it's like a hurricane out here?
I know. It was stupid --  -- Sam said hospital - someone's hurt?
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.
Oh my God - does my Dad know?
He and my dad are both over there.
Will Harry be okay?
I don't know. Come on. I'll find you something dry and drive you home.
Hundred and eight degrees over here.
Must be nice, never getting cold.
It's a wolf thing.
It's a Jacob thing.   You're just... warm.
 Like the sun.
 Like the sun.
Which always comes back.   You can count on me.
There are other cool things about all this, like -- I heal fast. Wanna see me stab my hand?
 Yeah, `cause that would be fun.
So... this wolf thing's not all bad? JACOB It's better. Now that you know. But...
... but...
It just... comes so easily to me. More than the other guys.
That's a good thing, isn't it?
Maybe. Or maybe it makes me less... human than the others.  Sometimes I'm scared I might... disappear, you know? Who I really am.
I won't let that happen.
Thanks for driving - for everything.
Holy crap -- !
There's a bloodsucker out there.
How do you know?
I can smell the stink.   I'm getting you out of here. As Jacob whips the truck around, the HEADLIGHTS ILLUMINATE --
Stop!   It's not Victoria --
Forget it --
It's Carlisle's car!   They're here. Go back! --
It's a trick --
Damn it, Bella --
Stop.   You gotta come with me. BELLA It's okay.   They're my friends --
Don't you get it? If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory. The Treaty says we can only defend our own lands.
-- It's not a war --
It is. And you'll only be safe in La Push. I can't protect you here anymore.
I don't need you to --
-- You're about to cross a line -- BELLA Only if you draw one.
I'm not letting you do this.
You don't have a choice.   I don't belong to you.
Bye, Bella, I hope you don't die.
Alice! ALICE You're... alive.
Oh my God, Alice.    You're here.
I heard voices - I didn't think it was you but - you're alive.
You keep saying that.
I saw you - a vision of you - you jumped off a cliff. I knew I'd be too late but --  Why the hell would you try to kill yourself?!
I didn't.    I was cliff diving.
Why?!
Um... fun?
That was fun for you.
Until I hit the water.
I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy... and what is that hideous wet dog smell?
Oh. Probably Jacob.      He's kind of a werewolf.
Werewolves are not vicious.
Until they lose their tempers.
They saved me from Laurent, they're protecting me from Victoria --
 Victoria? I didn't see her. I didn't see you get pulled from the water either.
It was Jacob who saved me. More than once. I couldn't have made it without him. You have no idea what it was like.
 Yes. I do. I knew leaving wouldn't be good for you. I tried to tell Edward, but he wouldn't listen.
 ... Does he know you're here?
No.   He's been... away...
What?
Wow, Edward finally answered the phone. I feel so honored...
I'm hanging up now...
Wait!... You should come home.  Esme's a wreck, Carlisle never smiles. Even Emmett's depressed. You've really done a number on them.
 I'm sorry. I am. But they wouldn't be happier with me around. Trust me.
I... I just miss... us.   The family.
I know. But the further away I am, the safer Bella will be. She deserves a shot at a normal life --
But see, you don't have to worry about that, not anymore --
Why, Rose?   Did something happen?
I - uh --
Tell me, Rosalie.  Tell me! --
 -- Alice had a vision. She saw Bella - - throw herself off a cliff... She's dead, Edward.
I... don't believe it.
Alice is there now. Thought she could help with the funeral or something.
Come home, Edward. It's time... Edward...? She's been disconnected.   Off Rosalie, worried...
Thanks for understanding, Bells. They wanted to keep the service small.
Don't worry about me.    Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah... but Sue, and those kids -- Leah's only a year older than you. And Seth's, what, fourteen...
There'll be a reception after. I might stay late, see if I can help.
You're not going?
I'm not the most popular person on the werewolf rez right now.
 Because you're friends with me.
Huh. Didn't see them coming. Didn't see him pull you out of the water - maybe my visions are allergic to dogs.
-- Alice.
 I'll go do some hunting.
Quil... you, too?
 Yeah. Me, too.
You alone?
Yes.   Shouldn't you be at the funeral?
Had to talk to you first.  I'll meet you there. Go on.
Look, Jake, I'm sorry I --
This place stinks to hell.
You're welcome to leave.      In fact --
-- How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying?
 Just Alice. And she'll stay as long as she wants.
Are the rest coming back?
Not that I'm aware of.      Anything else?
That's it.
Better go report to Sam.
I've done it again. I keep breaking my promise not to hurt you.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Yeah, it does.
Am I gonna lose you this time, Jacob?
It was easier when we were both human, wasn't it?
Swan residence.
He's not here. He's at a funeral...
Filthy bloodsucker.
Wait, who was it?
 Dr. Carlisle Cullen.
You should have let me talk to him.
He didn't ask for you --
Step away from me, Bella.
Alice, what's wrong?
... Edward.
What about him? What happened?
I just saw him in a vision.   He... thinks you're dead.
 That was him calling, not Carlisle.
Bella, he's going to Italy... to the Volturi...
Why do you have to go?
He won't believe Alice.    He has to see that I'm alive.
 He left you, Bella. He didn't want you anymore, remember?
But I still love him, and I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt. This wounds him. But she can't stop to soothe him.         She pulls away and continues packing.
What about your dad?
I'm eighteen, legally free to go. I'll leave a note.
Got the airline tickets.
 You Cullens might hunt animals but those monsters in Italy don't.
I'm well aware what the Volturi are. JACOB Then why are you taking Bella to them like a bottle of wine to a party?
Right, she's better off here with Victoria stalking her. The one you dogs can't seem to catch?
Let's go.
Please, Bella. Stay here.   For Charlie... for me.
Bye, Jacob.
Maybe Jacob's right. (Bella tries to interrupt) No. You need to realize - the Volturi could easily see me as Edward's accomplice. And you're a human who knows too much and tastes too good. They could kill us all.
Have you decided?
It was an intriguing debate.     We don't get many suicidal vampires.
Pathetic.
I'm afraid your gifts are too valuable to destroy. But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us. We'd be delighted to utilize your skills.
So you won't end this.
Not without cause.
Such a waste.
Where'd you get the car?
Hope you're not opposed to grand theft auto.
Not today.
How much time do we have.
He's waiting till noon, when the sun's at its highest... SMASH TO:
... He's going to make the Volturi change their minds.
 It's almost noon now.
There's Volterra.
Why are they all wearing red?
San Marcos Day festival. The perfect setting. Large crowds. The Volturi won't let him get far enough to reveal himself - he's counting on that.
We only have five minutes --
Where's the square?
Follow that lane --
He'll be under the clock tower!
Fare attenzione!
Edward! -- -- GONG! Bella's cry is drowned out by the BOOMING CHIME. She pushes toward him, fighting to reach him as --
No, Edward!    Don't!
Carlisle was right... heaven...
No, I'm here. I'm alive.
 You're... not real.
Look at me!    Alice was wrong.
Bella?
Please, step back.   I'm alive, I'm --
You're here.
I'm here. They share a long look, he's about to kiss her again... when suddenly, he stiffens -- and abruptly PUSHES Bella behind him, taking a protective stance in front of her --
I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen.
Aro wants to speak with you again.
No rules were broken.
We should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue.
Fine. Bella, why don't you stay and enjoy the festival?
The girl comes with us.
That's not going to happen --
Come on, guys, it's a festival.
We wouldn't want to make a scene.
There won't be any scene.    And we'll still win. EDWARD But not easily --
Enough.
 Jane.
 Who is she? ALICE  Just do as she says.
Follow me.
It's alright. Alice will catch you.
Buon pomeriggio.
What a happy surprise! Bella is alive after all. Isn't that wonderful?
Her blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty. How can you stand to be so close to her?
It's not without effort.
 I can see that.
One touch and Aro can see every thought I've ever had in my life.
You're quite the telepath yourself, Edward. Though... you can't read Bella's thoughts. Fascinating.
I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well.
Interesting.
I wonder if --
 No!
Let's see if she's immune to all our powers, shall we Jane?
Stop!
Jane, dear.    The girl?
Remarkable! She confounds us all.      So what do we do with you now?
 You already know what you'll do, Aro.
She knows too much; she's a liability.
That's true. Unless Edward intends to give her immortality...  But that's not your intention, is it. Shame.
Edward, don't!
 Stop this! Please!
Do it!    Kill me! Just leave them alone! -- as she yanks her collar back, exposing her neck to him. Aro is surprised and intrigued. A beat.
Enough.
Get away from her -- !
Edward, stop. I've already seen it.
 Alice, stay out of it.
I know what to do.
Ah yes, the clairvoyant. I saw your gift in Edward's thoughts. What is it you've seen? EDWARD ... don't...
I'm the one who will change Bella.
 Please. Be my guest.
Not here. Her father is in law enforcement. If she goes missing, there will be questions.
He is easily dealt with.
It will happen, Aro.   See for yourself.
Mesmerizing! To see the things you've seen, that haven't happened yet!
I'm so sorry.
 Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal. Go make your preparations.
You're letting them leave?
Dear Caius, the girl's disappearance will be conspicuous at best. And surely you see her potential.
 Let us be done with this.    Heidi will arrive any moment.
We will make sure she follows through. I would not delay. We do not offer second chances.
 Nice fishing, Heidi, save some for me.
 This way, please. Stay together...
Unusual tour, isn't it? TOURIST WIFE Bill, get a picture of that bust there.
-- Stop!
It... wasn't a dream.
Go back to sleep. You've been through a lot.
No, you might --
I'll be here when you wake up.
Why?   Out of guilt?
 You... think I asked the Volturi to kill me because I felt guilty? BELLA Didn't you?
I went to them because I thought I'd lost you.
You didn't even want me.
Bella. The only reason I left was to protect you. I wanted you to have a chance at a normal, happy life.
But it was so easy for you to leave.
I had to be convincing. But easy?     In my hundred years, I've never had a harder time than what I just went through.
I kept seeing you. Visions of you. Always protecting me. I thought I was going crazy.
Your own instincts were speaking to you. I wish it had been me. But you're the heroic one. You saved me.
You alright? Another nightmare?
I'm okay.    You don't have to worry.
Last time you said that, you disappeared. You want to talk nightmares? BELLA  I'm really sorry, Dad.
Just... don't ever do that to me again. Okay?  And you're grounded for the rest of your life.
I know.
Get some rest so I can keep lecturing you in the morning.
He won't forgive me easily.
Nope.
Will you? I don't deserve it but... I hope you will. Because I honestly have no idea how to live without you.
You won't be able to get rid of me once Alice changes me.
She won't have to. There are ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.
 They'll come after your whole family. You'd risk that just to keep me human?
Just? You really don't understand what you'd be giving up.
I really do. They look at each other; an impasse.    She decides something, grabs her jeans, pulls them on--
You're not the only one with a say in it.
You all know what Edward wants. And you know what I want. But I won't force myself on you...
I think the only fair way to handle this is by vote -- EDWARD You can't be serious --
 This is my meeting, Edward.
However this turns out, I'm not letting the Volturi hurt you. I'll go back to Italy alone --
The hell you will.   I'm not missing another fight.
That's not up for a vote, Emmett.    I don't want you involved.
We've always been involved, honey, and we're not going to stop --
No, please -- I want you to seriously think about this. If I join you, you'll be stuck with me for a long time - forever. It's a huge decision. And I want - I need your honesty here.
Then let's take a vote... Alice?
Like you're not already my sister.     Of course, yes!
I vote yes. It'll be a relief not to want to kill you.
Um.   Thanks? Okay, Rosalie? Rosalie, torn, looks at Edward who's stony toward her.
Edward, I'm sorry for what I did. I really am. And I know you're not ready to forgive me...  But this isn't the life I'd have chosen for myself. I wish there'd been someone to vote no for me... (she exchanges a glance with Carlisle - then...) So... no.
I vote hell yeah. We can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way.
I already think of you as part of the family. Yes.
Thank you, Esme. Carlisle moves, not to Bella, but to --
Edward --
You can't go along with this, Carlisle, you know what it means.
You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice. I won't lose my son.  But Alice has never turned anyone. It'd be safer if I did it --
Thank you.    Thank you all.
Where you headed?
Seattle.
 Sounds perfect.
When? BELLA After graduation.
Just two months.
It'll be best for Dad that way. I can pretend to be at college somewhere. Carlisle suggested it. But...  I wish you'd be the one to change me.
 Would you be willing to trade for that?
 Name it.
Five more years as a human.
The Volturi won't wait that long.
I'll settle for three.
 I won't risk it. It'll have to be Carlisle.
Why are you so willing to give up your soul?
Because I don't believe you've lost yours. And I want to share mine with you forever.
What is he doing?
He wants to talk to me.
Well, he can talk to me first.
You're still alive.
I've been calling you. JACOB Couldn't drop by?
He thinks I'm keeping you away.
 Stay the hell out of my head!
Dad grounded me, Jake. We're trying to get back before he wakes up.
Jacob, I know you have something to say to me, but I'd like to say something first. Alright?
 Thank you. For keeping Bella alive when I... didn't.
No, you didn't. And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.
I know. I'm still grateful.  But I'm back now. And I'm not leaving Bella's side till she orders me away.
We'll see.
Either way, we'll handle Victoria from here on out.
She's been laying low. Ever since your freaky sister showed up. Guess she can't stand you Cullens either.
She'll come back.
She does, she's ours.   She killed on our turf.
We'll see.
My turn to talk. I'm here to remind you about a key point in the Treaty.
 I haven't forgotten.
Good.
What?   What key point?
If any of them bites a human, the truce is over. That's bite, not kill.
 But... if I choose it, it's none of your business.
If you... what!? No.      No way.   I won't let you --
-- Bella, step back --
You're not gonna be one of them.
That's not your call --
 You know what we'll do to you - I won't have a choice -- EDWARD We're done here --
You don't speak for her!
Stop!
 Get out of here. Now!
 You do this, you'll be going through me.
I swear to God, I'm not moving.
 Give me a second. Please.
Read his thoughts.   Is he going to hurt me? Edward does, and finally, reluctantly backs away. But his eyes never leave the wolf's. They glare at one another.
Jacob, I love you. You're my best friend. But... I can't change how I feel. Please don't make me choose.  Because it'll be him. It's always been him.
But you know how important you are to --
There were problems ahead.     Seemingly insurmountable...
... If I didn't become a vampire, the Volturi would kill me. If I did, my best friend would do the job himself, or get killed in the attempt.
Victoria was still on the loose, putting everyone I loved in danger...
But I'd already survived the worst -- losing Edward. So I knew I could survive anything...
I'm here.   Always. And she sees that's the truth, believes it. He takes her hand and together they turn, heading out of the woods...
And soon, I'd be like him. We'd face our fate together. Forever.
