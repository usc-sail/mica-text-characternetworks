That's a funny one! Isn't that funnier?
It's hysterical, Manny. As long as we're laughing we won't be crying over the box office. Talk about depressing.
Twenty girls in feather boas prancing around like circus ponies! That's depressing!
 I love a good chorus line!
What's this?
It's a play.
Who wrote it, Annie?
Some guy - Driscoll. reading the jacket of book) From the Federal Theatre.
Don't knock it, honey - at least they get an audience.
It'll pick up .... Ain't that right, Manny?
 It always does.
The trick is to start the build right at the back of your throat...  Works well out through the nose too.
Have you eaten today?
 Oh, I'm not hungry. Don't worry about me. ANN Hey - you're all I've got.
Come on - take me to dinner.
You think the kitchen'll still be open on Third?
Soup and biscuits - perfect.
 Hey! Harry, what's going on?
Hey, open up! We work here.
Not anymore.
 It's all right for you! We haven't had a pay check in two weeks - how we going to eat?
They're not going to get away with this.
They just did.
Ann ... Annie! It's no use.
The show it's over - it's done. 'm done. I'm leaving, Annie ... I'm going back to Chicago. I'm sorry ...
I'm sorry, Ann. Ever since you were small people have been letting you down. But you gotta think of yourself now. You should try out for that part.
It's what you've always wanted. Oh, I know what you're thinking - every time you reach out for something you care about ... fate comes along and snatches it away.
But not this time, Annie ... not this time.
 Oh, hello Mr. Weston?!
Oh, Jeez ...
Look, Miss ... I told you already; call my office - leave your resume with my secretary.
Why would I want to do that when we can talk about it in person?
Because that's what a smart girl would do.
But I already sent you my resume - you returned it unopened.
What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very particular about who he works with.
Please, just an audition - that's all I'm asking.
esus - you don't give up, do you?
Mr. Weston, I know this role backwards.
ell, that's too bad - because we just gave the part to someone else. Sorry, kid - the play is cast.
Look - I know times are tough. You want my advice? Use what you got. You're not bad looking - a girl like you doesn't have to starve.
There's a new place, just opened.  Listen, princess - this gig ain't the Palace, you understand? Ask for Kenny K. Tell him I sent you.
 Just play the date, take the money and forget you was ever there.
How much more is there?
Another five reels.
Lights up.
This is it? This is what we get for our forty grand, Denham? Another one of your Safari pictures?
You promised us romantic scenes with Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie.
Come on, fellas - you know the deal - we agreed to push Maureen's start date so she could get her teeth fixed.
It's not the principle of the thing - it's the money.
Carl - you've been in production for over two months -
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen are gonna steam up the screen - once we get them on the ship. ELMAN What ship?
The one we've hired to get to the location.
What location? Carl - you're supposed to be shooting on the back-lot.
Yes, I understand that - but fellas, we're not making that film anymore - and I'll tell you why.
The story has changed, the script has been rewritten.
Life intervened! I've come into possession of a map. growing excitement) The soul surviving record of an unchartered island, a place that was thought to exist only in myth ... until now!
Whoa! Carl - slow down!
Is he askin' for more money?
He's asking us to fund a wild goose- chase.
I'm talking about a primitive world ... never before seen by man! The ruins of an entire civilisation - the most spectacular thing you've ever seen!  That's where I'll shoot my picture!
Will there be boobies?
Excuse me, boobies?
Jigglies, jablongers, bazoomers! ... In my experience people only go to these films to observe the ... undraped form of the native girls.
What are you - an idiot? You think they asked De Mille to waste his time on nudie shots? No - they respected the film maker, they showed some class! Not that you'd know what that means - you cheap low-life!
Would you step outside for a moment, Carl?
Gimme that - quick!
You won't like it, it's non-alcoholic!
Preston, you have a lot to learn about the motion picture business.
Don't write him off fellas. He's hot- headed sure, but Carl Denham's made some interesting pictures, he's had a lot of ... near success.
 He's a preening self promoter ...
 ... an ambitious no-talent! The guy has "loser" written all over him.
Look, I understand your disappointment.
He's washed up - It's all over town!
He can't direct. He doesn't have the smarts.
This jumped up little turd's gonna bankrupt us.
The animal footage has value?
Sure ... Universal are desperate for stock footage.
Then sell it! Scrap the picture! We gotta retrieve something from this debacle. ELMAN nods ... gestures to the YOUNG ASSISTANT.
Get him back in.
Mr. Denham?
I want the cast and crew on the ship within the hour.
o Carl, you can't do this!
Tell `em the studio's pressured us into an early departure.
It's not ethical!
hat are they gonna do - sue me? They can get in line! I'm not going to let them kill my film.
ou realize none of the camera equipment is on board. We have no permits ... no visas ...
hat's why I have you, Preston.
We have no insurance, no foreign currency - in fact, we have no currency of any kind -
Get in there!
ho's gonna pay for the ship?
Get out of there!
tep on it!
 You're finished, Denham!
on't worry Preston - I've had a lot of practice at this: I'm real good at crapping the crappers.
And two dozen of Mr. Walker's finest
Red label, 80% proof - packed in a crate marked "lemonade".
You got it ... and tell Maureen - she doesn't have six hours to put on her face. If she wants to be in this picture, she's gotta be on that boat!
She doesn't want to be in this picture.
Maureen pulled out.
She pulled out?!
Yesterday. I told you.
 You said we were shooting in Singapore, right? That's what you told her?
But we're not shooting in Singapore.
exasperation) Goddammit, Preston! All you had to do is look her in the eye and lie.
I gotta get to a phone ... talk to Harlow's people.
he`s unavailable.
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow? Mae West?
Mae West?! No! She has to be a size four!
ou gotta get a girl who'll fit Maureen's costumes.
 Fay's a size four!
es she is, but she is doing a picture with RKO.
ooper huh?  I might have known.
We gotta delay the shoot - shut production down ... We can't sail tonight!
Not an option.
Carl!
I said I'd find a girl.
For Godsake, Preston - think like a winner. Call Jack ... I need that Goddamn screenplay!
Defeat is always momentary.
 You gonna pay for this?
Excuse me ...
Ma'am, I think you dropped this.
Vaudeville huh? I worked Vaudeville once... that is a tough audience. If you don't kill them fast, they kill you.
Mr. Denham - I want you to know that I'm not in the habit of accepting charity from strangers, or for that matter ... taking things that don't belong to me. DENHAM t was obviously a terrible misunderstanding.
It's just that, I haven't been paid in a while ...
mock sincerity) That's awful. Anyway, Ann - may I call you Ann?
... You wouldn't happen to be a size four by any chance?
No! Oh God, no! You've got me all wrong. Miss Darrow, please! I'm not that type of person at all!
What type of person are you?
I'm someone you can trust, Ann. I'm a movie producer.  Believe me, I am on the level, no funny business. Please, sit down - Please ... Please.
 Ann, I want you to imagine a handsome explorer bound for the Far East.
You're filming in the Far East?
Singapore. On board ship he meets a mysterious girl. She's beautiful ... she's fragile ... haunted ...
She can't escape the feeling that forces beyond her control are compelling her down a road from which she cannot draw back. It's as if her whole life has been a prelude to this moment - this fateful meeting that changes everything. And sure enough, against her better judgement -
She falls in love.
Yes!
But she doesn't trust it. She's not even sure if she believes in love.
Oh really?
If she loves someone - it's doomed.
Why is that?
Good things never last, Mr. Denham.
So you're interested?
That's settled then. I don't want to rush you - but we are under some time pressure here.
Well I really -
Ann? I'm telling you, You're perfect - look at you! You're the saddest girl I ever met ... you're gonna make `em weep, Ann - you're gonna break their hearts!
See, that's where you're wrong, Mr. Denham, I make people laugh, that's what I do.
Good luck with your picture.
 Ann! Miss Darrow! Please!
Jack Driscoll?
ure. Why - wait! You know him?
Well, no - not personally. I've seen his plays.
What a writer, huh? And let me tell you Ann, Jack Driscoll doesn't want just anyone starring in this picture. He said to me, "Carl, somewhere out there is a woman born to play this role ..."  And as soon as I saw you, I knew -
 Knew what?
It was always going to be you.
 Is this the moving picture ship?
Not exactly ... it's actually this one over here.
Don't let appearances deceive you. It's much more spacious on board.
Haul away ...
Is this all of the equipment? This is all of it? We're taking the Bell and Howell? Good. You got all the lenses - you got the two and the six?
Carl!
Yes - to MIKE and HERB) Get it on board, fellas. Come on. NGLE ON: PRESTON hurrying down the GANGWAY. He rushes up to DENHAM ... his eyes flick to ANN, but he pulls DENHAM to one side.
 They're on their way. I've just had word.
Who?
 Men in uniform. The studio called the cops!
Englehorn! Cast off! Hoist up the mainsail - raise the anchor, whatever the hell it is you do - we gotta leave.
I cannot do that ... we're waiting on the manifest.
What? Who? English - please!
 Paperwork, Mr. Denham.
 I'll give you another thousand to leave right now.
You haven't given me the first thousand yet.
Can we talk about this later. Can't you see we're in the company of a VIP guest?
Ma'am...
Ann Darrow.
So you are ready for this voyage, Miss Darrow?
Sure...
Nervous?
Nervous - no. Why? Should I be?
It isn't every woman who would take such a risk.
 Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her cabin?
Wonderful idea, thank you, Preston.
Miss Darrow, if you'd just - Hi, my name is Preston, Carl's assistant.
Two thousand - it's a deal ... Will you take a cheque?
Do I have a choice?
Please, follow me. If there's anything that you need ... `excuse me fellas, if there's anything that you need please don't hesitate to ... ask ...
Jesus, Jack - you scared me!
Listen, if anyone comes to the door, don't open it. You haven't seen me ... say I got depressed and committed suicide. Say I stuck my head down a toilet! holding up a bottle) You want one?
No! I can't stay, Carl. I have a rehearsal for which I am now ... checks WATCH) ... three hours late.
What's this?
It's the script.
This is a script? Jack ... this is fifteen pages.
I know - but they're good! You've got fifteen good pages there, Carl!
I'm supposed to be making a feature length picture.
You told me I had more time. I'm sorry. Look I gotta go.
Jack - No - you can't do this to me! I have a beginning but I need a middle and an end! I gotta have something to shoot.
You got my notes - I gotta go. See you.
Alright, fine. We might as well settle up.
You're going to pay me?
I'm not going to stiff a friend.
I've never known you to volunteer cash before ...
How does two grand sound?
Sounds great!
Thought it might.
 Voila!
Thanks...
Carl ... you've written "Two Grand".
So I did ... Sorry about that  Let's start from the beginning.
 "Two Thousand Dollars" ...
It is the 29th, isn't it?
 Come on - it's the 25th, Carl, the 25th!
I'm sorry. Let me just ... It'll just take a second.
Never mind, pay me when you get back!
 Alright ... okay ...
Your cabin's just down here, Mr. Baxter. May I say how excited we are to have you back with us, Sir.
Be a sport and lend us a hand.
Oh, Christ!
 Appreciate the help, fella.
Let me get the door for you - welcome to your state room sir.
know, that's not a nice smell is it? I'm sure it'll disperse in a day or two. Did I ever mention how much I love your work, Mr. Baxter? I've seen every one of your pictures ... even the silent ones.
I haven't made any silent ones.
Dead slow ahead both, Mr Hayes.
Dead slow ahead both, Captain.
Oh Christ!
Goddammit!
I keep telling you, Jack, there's no money in theatre.
No, no, no!
You're much better off sticking with film.
I don't do it for the money, Carl. I happen to love the theatre.
o, you don't.
If you really loved it, you would have jumped.
 I hope you find it to your liking... it's quite comfortable. Your towels and linens are underneath the bed. That is the wash basin. I know, that's not a pleasant smell - is it? I'm sure it'll disperse in a day or two.
The closet ... your costumes - I hope you'll find everything is in order. If there is anything that you need, please do not hesitate to ask...fresh water, perhaps? I can bring it to you personally.
Knock knock! We can't have our leading lady deprived of the necessities of life. to PRESTON) Do me a favour - run a bottle down to Jack. It'll fend off his migraine.
They're still trying to find a place for him to sleep.
 You told him my typewriter is available for hire?
Yes - he didn't take it well.
 Mr. Driscoll ...?
He's on board?
Jack has his heart set on coming. Call me a softie - I couldn't say no.
This room very comfortable, plenty dim light ... fresh straw.
What'd you keep down here?
Lion, tiger, hippo - you name it.
What, do you sell them to Zoos?
Zoos ... circus ...  Skipper get big money for rare animal.  Careful! Camel have bad accident on floor. Stain unremovable ...
 Skipper catch any animal you want. He do you real good price on rhite wino. ENGLEHORN  Choy!
My apologies for not being able to offer you a cabin. Have you found an enclosure to your taste?
 Spoilt for choice.
What are you, Mr. Driscoll, a lion or a chimpanzee?
Maybe, I'll take this one.
I told you to lock it up.
 Sorry, Skipper! Lumpy said -
 Lumpy doesn't give the orders. What are you trying to do? Put the whole ship to sleep? Get them out of here!
Compliments of the chef -
Oh Christ - oh God!
Lambs brains in walnut sauce.
Jimmy!
You run those ropes up on deck like I told you?
Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.
How about you return Mr. Driscoll's pen first?
He doesn't mean any harm. I'll keep him out of Jyour way.
No, it's okay.
It's just he likes it down here, it's where I found him ... four years ago ... stowed away in one of them cages. His arm was broken in two places, he was wilder than half the animals in here. Still won't tell me where he came from - all I know, it wasn't any place good.
You gotta straighten up. You don't want to be on this ship for the rest of your life.
I do.
No, you don't, Jimmy. You wanna get yourself educated. Give yourself some options. Take this serious.
I do, Mr. Hayes, I do! Look, I've been readin'.
Where did you get this?
 I borrowed it ...
... on long term loan. Look at this.
"Adventures on a Tramp Steamer". See - just like us.
It's nice to meet you Mr. Driscoll - I'm actually quite familiar with your work.  Oh yes! ... Hello, Mr Driscoll - it's so nice to meet you! Actually, I'm quite familiar with your work. I'm a huge fan!  I've read everything you've ever written.
IKE I'm gonna have the ships' engines all over the dialogue - sea gulls, camera noise, wind and Christ knows what else!
I don't care, Mike! You're the sound recordist - make it work.
Ann! Come on in! Let me introduce you to the crew! This is Herb - our cameraman ...
Delighted to meet you, ma'am. And may I say what a lovely dress.
Oh! This old thing! I just - threw it on!
 Isn't that one of Maureen's costumes?
 What does a girl have to do round here to get some breakfast!
Lumpy! You heard the lady!
Fancy some of me ... ah ... Porridge aux walnuts?
ANN, I don't believe you've met -
That's alright Mr. Denham, I know who this is ...
Thrilled to meet you. It's an honour - to be part of this.
 Gee, thanks!
Actually - I am quite familiar with your work.
Really?
Yes, and what I most admire - is the way you have captured the voice of the common people.
Well - that's my job.
I'm sure you've heard this before, Mr Driscoll, if you don't mind me saying - you don't look at all like your photograph ... NGLE ON: JACK at the bar, holding a cup of COFFEE. He turns and glances at ANN.
Excuse me?
Wait a minute! Ann -
 Well, he's so much younger - in person.  And much better looking.
ANN! Stop! Stop - right there -
I was afraid you might be one of those self obsessed literary types. You know - the tweedy twerp with his nose in a book and his head up his -
It's nice to meet you too, Miss Darrow..
She's standing at the railing ... she doesn't know it yet, but they're sailing towards disaster. You got that?
She turns ... The First Mate is staggering towards her - there's a knife sticking out of his back!
ait a second, we're killing off the First Mate?
That's assuming she knows who the First Mate is.
Come on, Jack! It was an honest mistake. Ann is near-sighted - it could happen to anyone.
I was joking, Carl.
The point is: she's horrified. She has to look away. And that's when she sees it.
See's what? What?
 The island.
 We're filming on an island now? When did this happen?
Jack, keep your voice down! I don't want the crew getting spooked.
Why would they get spooked? What's it called?
All right ... It has a local name, but I'm warning you, Jack, it doesn't sound good.
 They call it ... 
What's wrong with this place?
There's nothing officially wrong with it. Because technically it hasn't been discovered yet.
 Okay ... alright ... so we arrive at this place ... typing) S ... k ... u ...
l ... l ... Island.
All right everyone, from the top.   And ... action!
I think this is awfully exciting! I've never been on a ship before.
I've never been on one with a woman before.
I guess you don't think much of women on ships, do you?
No, they're a nuisance.
Well, I'll try not to be.
Just being around is trouble.
Well! Is that a nice thing to say!
It's a dangerous thing, having girls on ships. They're messy and they're unreliable!
 Cut! Great!
Bruce, wonderful performance. You can relax for ten minutes.
That was very natural... I felt moved.
hat do you think, Driscoll? The dialogue's got some flow now - huh?
It was pure effluence.
beefed up the banter ...
Try to resist that impulse.
It's just a little humor, Bud - what are you, a Bolshevik or something?
Actors. They travel the world but all they ever see is a mirror!
Good legs.
Sea legs - I meant - you know ... sea legs. Not that you don't have good legs, I was just ...
... making conversation. Jesus!  Miss Darrow!
About the scene - today, with you and Bruce -
I know, it wasn't what you wrote. But Mr Baxter felt very strongly that when a man likes a woman - then he must ignore her. And if things turn really hostile ... no?
Interesting theory.
I know ... I should have -
It wasn't what I had intended ... but it -
I'm sorry - I was ...
You made it your own ...
I was nervous.
It was funny, actually ... you were funny.
Please - don't say another word. Good night.
Miss Darrow ...
You don't have to be nervous.
We're close. Head south-west.
There's no land south-west for thousands of miles. It takes us way outside the shipping lanes.
I won't sail blind in these waters.
'll make it worth your while.
There's nothing out there.
hen you've nothing to lose.
If someone were to tell you this ship is headed for Singapore, what would you say?
I would say they was full of it, Mr. Hayes. We turned south-west last night.
Gentlemen please, we're not looking for trouble -
No. You're looking for something else
 Yes .... we are. We're gonna find Skull Island! We're gonna find it, film it and show it to the world. For twenty five cents you get to see the last blank space on the map!
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
What do you mean?
Seven years ago, me and Mr Hayes - we were working our passage on a Norwegian barque.
We picked up a castaway - found him in the water - he'd been drifting for days.
His ship had run aground on an island, way West of Sumatra. An island hidden in fog. He spoke of a huge wall, built so long ago - no one knew who had made it ... A wall a hundred foot high ... as strong today as it was, ages ago.
Why did they build the wall?
The castaway - he spoke of a creature, neither beast nor man, but something monstrous, living behind that wall...
A lion or a tiger. A man-eater. That's how all these stories start.
 What else did he say?
Nothing. We found him the next morning ... he'd stuck a knife through his heart.
orry fellas, you'll have to do better than that. Monsters belong in B movies!
If you find this place -
If you go ashore with your friends and your cameras ... you won't come back ... Just so long as you understand that.
 How long do you expect us to stay out here?
 You're writing a stage comedy?
I'm writing it for you.
Why would you do that?
Why would I write a play for you?
Yes.
Isn't it obvious?
Not to me.
Well, it's in the sub-text.
I guess I must've missed it.
It's not about words ...
Message for you, Captain.
 What's going on?
Hayes! Why are we turning around?
 Englehorn, you can't just ...
 Outside!
There's a warrant out for your arrest. Did you know that? I've been ordered to divert to Rangoon.
nother week - I haven't got a film yet. Please - I have risked everything I have on this!
No, Denham - you risked everything I have.     D DENHAM What do you want? Tell me what you want? I'll give you anything.
I want you off my ship.
Set a course for Rangoon, Mr Hayes.
I'm finished. It's over for me, Jack.
How did you think this would end, Carl?
 Captain ...
Check our position. Use the stars.
 There are no stars, Captain.
What is that?
 What?
That.
I don't know ... what is it, a coffee stain?
Station the for'head lookout, and get me the depth by lead-line!
Aye, Captain.
 Thirty fathoms ... no bottom!
Reduce speed, steerage way only.
Dead slow ahead, both.  You should stop the ship.
15 degrees Port.  We're getting out of here, Mr. Hayes ... we'll find clear conditions.
 We have seabed!
 Twenty-five fathoms!
We're shallowing!
20 degrees starboard!
 Captain, you don't know where the hell you're going!
Get me another reading!
 Another reading!
Twenty-two fathoms!
Douse the lights!
Aye, aye Captain ...
 Ten fathoms!
 Wall! There's a wall ahead!!!
Stop engines!
Give me some power! Half astern, both!
Half astern, both, Captain!
Rocks!
 Rocks to starboard ... to port ... rocks everywhere!
Take the wheel, Hayes!
Full ahead!
Rocks to port, Captain!
Hayes!
he's taken a pounding ...
What about the prop?
Shaft's not bent, far as we can tell, but she's stuck hard against the rock -
Captain! You'd better come up quick!
You want me to bring them back?
I don't give a damn about Carl Denham ... I want this ship fixed and ready to float on the next high tide. We're leaving Mr. Hayes.
 Can you believe this, Jack? ... Skull Island! We got our picture!
Why does Marlow keep going up the river, why doesn't he turn back?
shrugs) There's a part of him that wants to, Jimmy. A part, deep inside himself that sounds a warning, but there's another part, that needs to know ... that needs to defeat the thing which makes him afraid.
"We could not understand, because we were too far ... and could not remember, because we were travelling in the night of First Ages ...
... of those Ages that are gone, leaving hardly a sign and no memories
We are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but there, there you could look at a thing monstrous and free."
 It's not an adventure story - is it, Mr. Hayes.
 No, Jimmy, it's not.
It's deserted ...
DENHAM Of course it's deserted. Use your eyes, Preston. The place is a ruin! Nobody's lived here for hundreds of years.
 Mr Denham ... I think we should go back.
will handle this.
Look chocolate ... you like chocolate?
Good to eat! Take it ... take it!
For Godsake, Denham, leave the native alone.
She doesn't want the chocolate!
t's alright - it's just a bunch of women and old folks ... they're harmless.
Mike?
AST ACTION: NATIVE MEN emerge as if from NOWHERE ... before anyone can react, they are roughly SHOVED and PULLED into the MIDST of the FURIOUS NATIVE MOB.
 Larri yu sano kor ... Kweh yon kah`weh ad-larr ... tor Kng.
Seen enough?
 Lighten the ship! Anything that's not bolted down goes overboard!
We got away. We gotta be grateful for that gentlemen.
What about Mike? He didn't get away - he's still there!
 Mike died doing what he believed in! He didn't die for nothing. And I'll tell you something else - I'm going to finish this film - for Mike.
Hear! Hear!
Where's Ann?
She went to her cabin.
Wheel amidship ... Full ahead, both engines.
Ann!
top! Stop! Turn back, we have to turn back!
They've taken Ann!
All hands going ashore ...
... report to stations! Jump to it!
What the hell are you doing? You want that boat to sink? Stow those rifles midships - come on, hurry it up!
Lower away!
 What in God's name was that?
 Behind the wall!
 She's gone!
She's gone!
Carl? What is it?  You saw something ...
You can take Hayes and fifteen others. I'll put a guard on the gate until you return ... The rest of you, stay with the ship.
Not you, Jimmy.
Com'on Mr. Hayes, look at `em. None of them knows a which way to point a gun.
Stay here.
Miss Darrow needs me!
No!
 Bring the tripod - and all of the film stock.
You wanna go with the six inch lens?
The wide angle will do just fine.
You got guns, you got food, you got ammo. You got twenty-four hours.
Twenty-four hours?
This time tomorrow we haul anchor.
Ann!
 Ann!
Christ! It's a bleeding bone yard!  They've been ripped limb from limb.
 ANN! Ann!
Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes. Pretend you didn't see me.
esus, Jimmy!
defiant) Hey! I need that!
 I'm not giving you a gun!
You were younger than me when they gave you one!
I was in the army. I was trained - I had a drill sergeant!
quietly) I just wanna help bring her back.
Don't make me regret it.
growling) Conserve your ammunition!
I'm knackered! I've gotta have a breather.
Hey fellas - we don't have time for this. We've lost too much ground already! Come on, - get up!
 They're not about to quit on you. Cut them some slack.
Alright, you got five minutes! Everybody stay in sight!
 Over here. I wanna get a wide shot of the valley.
Bloody Nora!
Is that what took Miss Darrow?
 There's only one creature capable of leaving a footprint that size ...
The abominable snowman!
 It's gotta be - what? Twenty - twenty- five feet?
 Carl saw it. Let's ask him.
Denham! no answer) Where'd he go?
Carl!!!
low) Walk forward, Bruce.
What?!
You're the star of this picture! Get into character and head towards the animals.
What the hell kind of place is this?  Are you sure about this, Denham??? Don't we have a stand-in for this type of thing?
need you in the shot, or people will say they're fake.
Nobody's gonna think these are fake!
ou're making them nervous! No sudden movement.
I'm not moving.
 Mother of God ...
What is it?! Where's Carl?
He's - he's ... um ... well, he's up there ... filming.
Run Jack!
Holy Christ!
 Go Jimmy - Run!
Leave it!!!
No!!!
 No!!!!
ACK crawls past huge HEAVING BELLIES and TWITCHING LEGS ... he staggers out of the DINOSAUR PILE-UP ... he turns back at the SOUND OF LOUD HISSING - a CARNOTAURUS is climbing over a DEAD BRONTOSAUR, it's gleaming eyes intent on JACK. The CARNOTAURUS leaps ...
 Go! Go!
 Carl!? Carl?! Get up!
Run!
Herb! Come on!
 Mr Denham ... ! Take the tripod.
Come on Herb - I'm pulling you up. Come on, hold on to your end.
 You gotta go!!
I'm not going anywhere without you!
You gotta leave me!
Jimmy, do a head count. I wanna know how many injured and how bad -
 Injured? Four of us are dead!
It's not your fault. What happened to Herb - it's no ones fault.
 You're absolutely right, Preston ... And I'll tell you something else. Herbert didn't die for nothing. He died for what he believed in and I'm gonna honour that.
He died believing there is still some mystery left in this world - and we can all have a piece of it - for the price of an admission ticket!  Goddammit Preston we're gonna finish this film for Herb. We'll finish it, and donate the proceeds to his wife and kids.
 We gotta get back to the ship. Englehorn sails in nine hours.
So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.
Hey, did you hear me? We're gonna be stranded here!
Miss Darrow was a great gal - no question. She was a wonderful person. It's a terrible loss. We're all gonna miss her.
I always knew you were nothing like the tough guy you play on screen - I just never figured you for a coward.
Hey, pal, wake up. Heroes don't look like me - not in the real world. In the real world they've got bad teeth, a bald spot and a beer gut ... be seeing ya.
Anyone else?
 No! I said no!
 That's all there is ... there isn't any more.
 What is it?
 Mr. Hayes ...?
If anything happens, I want you to run! Understand?
I'm not a coward - I ain't gonna run.
 It's not about being brave, Jimmy.
o back! Back across the log!
I ain't gonna run.
Get Jimmy out of here.
No! Let him go!  Kill him! Kill him!
 Look at me! Look at me!
 Bring him down! Mr Hayes!
deadly calm) You've gotta run, Jimmy.
No! I ain't gonna run.
Do as I say.  o with Jack ... All of you.
Run!
No!
 Shoot him!
Hey! Here! Over here!
Lumpy! Help me!
hey ATTACK KONG and ANN ... a BREATHTAKING FIGHT to the DEATH. KONG fights like a madman on three separate fronts ... Not only does he have to do battle with the TYRANNOSAURS, he is also PROTECTING ANN - constantly transferring her from ONE HAND to THE OTHER as the TYRANNOSAURS SNAP AT HER HEELS.
Wait!
Carl!!!
Jimmy?
It's alright ... it's okay ...
Look - it's you ... "Kong". See ... you. "Kong". This is you.
 It's beautiful.
Beautiful.
Beau-ti-ful.
Thank God.
Don't thank God, thank Mr. Baxter ...
He insisted on a rescue mission. Me? I knew you'd be okay ...
That's the thing about cockroaches; no matter how many times you flush them down the toilet they always crawl back up the bowl!
ey buddy! I'm outta the bowl! I'm drying off my wings and trekking across the lid!
Driscoll ... don't be a fool! Give it up, it's useless ... She's dead.
 She's not dead. Jack's gonna bring her back.
And the ape will be hard on his heels. We can still come out of this thing okay -  More than okay. Think about it, you've got a boat full of chloroform we can put to good use.
You want to trap the Ape? I don't think so.
Isn't that what you do? Live animal capture? I heard you were the best.
Jack!
 Look after yourself!
Keep the Gate open.
Sure thing, buddy! Good luck!
I'm sorry.
 Jack, run!
 No!
 This way! Come on!
NGLE ON: JACK and ANN are HELPLESS ... KONG almost HAS THEM! BAT- THINGS dive towards JACK and ANN!
 Hang on to me!
 Carl!
Please! Somebody help us!
 They've gone.
 Carl? Oh Christ! Carl?
Drop the bridge! Do it now, for chrissakes!
 Not yet ... wait.
Wait ...
 No Carl ...
 Now!!!
to ENGLEHORN) Bring him down! Do it!
ANN No!
Are you out of your mind? Carl!
Drop the net!
Gas him!
 No! Please - don't do this!
Ann ... He'll kill you!
No, he won't.
No!
Keep him down!
Stop it! You're killing him!
Get her out of here! Get her out of his sight!
Do it!
Let go of me ...
We can't contain him!
Kill it!
No!
It's over, you Goddamn lunatic!
I need him alive!
Shoot it!!!
Jimmy - get out of here! Get to the boat!  All of you! Run!
Get in the boat!
 No! It's me he wants. I can stop this -
Take her!
Let me go to him!
Row! Get the hell out of here!
Jimmy! No!
Go back!
Hold her!
Wait!
NGLE ON: KONG starts CRAWLING painfully towards ANN. ENGLEHORN has almost finished LOADING.
Leave him alone!
he whole world will pay to see this. We're millionaires, boys. I'll share it with all of you! In a few months his name will be up in lights on Broadway! "Kong - the Eighth Wonder of the World"!
Look at yourself! Look at what you've become!
No woman is worth this!
This woman is worth it. I've gotta win her back. I don't care what it takes.
She's not gonna buy it for a second!
Shuddup and hand me the grapefruit.
Tell me everything - every little detail!
So, he took me to a fancy French restaurant ...
French, huh?
Anyway about half way through the whore derves - he clutches my hand ...
He clutches your hand?!
 It felt like the right thing to do at the time.  Oh! I'm sorry - I couldn't help but over-hear!
He's looking into my eyes -
And that's when he told you how he felt?
No - he never said it.
He never said it?!
 He probably thought he didn't need to say it.
Then how does she know that it's real?
He said it was not about the words.
Please - if you feel it, you say it. It's really very simple.
He said we'd talk about it later. Only there was no later ...
It never happened.  I just thought that maybe this one time, things might actually work out - which was really very ...
... foolish ....
Men! They'll give you the world ... But they let the one thing that truly matters slip through their fingers. All for the sake of three little words!
 The three hardest words in the English language!
hank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Ladies and Gentlemen, I am here to tell you a very strange story ... a story of our adventure in which seventeen of our party suffered horrible deaths! Their lives lost in pursuit of a savage Beast, a monstrous aberration of nature! But even the meanest brute can be tamed. Yes, Ladies and Gentlemen, as you will see, the Beast was no match for the charms of a girl - a girl from New York ... who melted his heart. Bringing to mind that old Arabian proverb ...
You're on, Miss Darrow, five minutes.
nd now Ladies & Gentlemen, I'm going to show you the greatest thing your eyes have ever beheld. He was a King in the world he knew but he comes to D         you now ... a captive!
Ladies and gentlemen: I give you Kong - the Eighth Wonder of the World!!
Don't be alarmed, ladies and gentlemen. It is perfectly safe. These chains are made of chrome steel!
dramatic) Observe if you will, I am touching the beast! I am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.
We have in the auditorium tonight, a surprise guest. The real life hero of this story ... the man who hunted down the mighty "Kong"!
The man who risked all to win the freedom of a helpless female! A big hand for ... Mr. Bruce Baxter!
Ladies and Gentlemen, imagine if you will an uncharted island ... a forgotten fragment from another time ... And clinging to life in this savage place, imagine a people untutored in the ways of the civilised world. A people who have dwelt all their lives in the shadow of Fear! In the shadow of ... "Kong"!
 He was right ...
... about there still being some mystery left in this world ...
 And we can all have a piece of it ... for the price of an admission ticket.
 That's the thing you come to learn about Carl ... his unfailing ability to destroy the things he loves.
lease remain calm, Ladies and Gentlemen - for we now come to the climax of this savage ritual ... the Sacrifice of a beautiful young girl!
Behold her terror as she is offered up to the mighty "Kong"! A big hand folks for the bravest girl I ever met! Miss Ann Darrow!
No! No! Help me, no!
Where is she??
 Where's Ann?
I've no idea. I heard he offered her all kinds of money and she turned him down flat.
Here's your story, boys - "Beauty and the Man who saved her from the Beast".
 We have get these people out of here -
Everyone has to leave.
Well to be honest with you, I had some anxious moments ...
For a while there it looked like I wasn't going to get paid ... But as it turned out, Mr. Denham here has been more than generous -
et him roar! It makes a swell picture!!!
Head for the exits ...
Get your own seat Buddy - you ain't having mine.
ACK watches as KONG'S FEAR builds to a growing sense of ANGER and FRUSTRATION!
 Oh Jesus ...
Follow that ape!
It's all yours, Buddy!
Fire!
Standby to fire!
I can't give that order! Sir, the ape's holding a girl -
 Then I guess it's her unlucky day. shouts to his GUNNERS) Take aim!
Sir ...?!
 Shoot to kill!  Fire!
 Beautiful ...
Yes ... yes it is.
No!!!
No! No!
Come on, boys, move on! Show's over! Stay back! Behind the line!
Why'd he do that? Climb up there and get himself cornered? The ape musta known what was comin'.
It's just a dumb animal - it didn't know nuthin'!
What does it matter? The airplanes got him.
It wasn't the airplanes ...
... it was beauty killed the beast.
