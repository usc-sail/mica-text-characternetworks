Hey, you! You gotta message.
What?
Message in d'box!  You deaf?
Got my money?
What?  I...  How long have I been here?
Jeez, too damn long if you ask me! What about the two weeks y'owe me...
What is your name...  What is your name...
Hey!
I'll be back later.
Yeah.  Well, y'better be.
Gesundheit!
...but you told me the meeting was ten-thirty.
I know, sir, but I can't make it at nine-thirty...  It's  -  um  -  well, inconvenient...
Yes, sir...  I understand...  Yes... But, I've done fine so far without an assistant...
But...  But I...  I...  Nine-thirty.  Yes.
There you are.
You are lost, yes?
Co-operate.  Do not make this difficult.
You will not shoot, yes.  There is a place in your mind, a corner of darkness...
Good evening, sir.
Yes.  This way.
Welcome, gentlemen.  Youre early. Here for the examination, right?
The handiwork of an extremely sick individual.
Youve read the reports.  Not much to go on.  We know nothing about him, except that he likes to cut them... Always the same type of blade. Forensics match in each case... Anyway, it's all in the reports, read them for yourself.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
I see.  One things for sure, hes ambitious. Youll be a busy man from now on.
You can say that again.
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnt this his case?
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnt with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, hows your mother?
Shes getting better, thanks.  She...
Very good...
Lets go, Bumstead.  So much to do and so little time.
We are looking for Jonathan White.
What for?
Which room is he in?
The noodles.  Ill have some noodles.
We call.
A real shame...
YAAAAAAAAAH!
Dont fall asleep.  Might never wake, yes.
Fifty-six.
Fifty-six...  Fifty-six...
Where have you been?  The doctors been worried about you.
What?  Who are you?
Cmon, lets go!  We dont have any time.
Hold it a minute.  Lets start at the beginning, huh?
Shit!  Quick!  Run!
Shit.
We got another one upstairs
Great.
Dammit!
Sorry, sir.
Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Patricia Crenshaw.
Im your new assistant.
I didnt requisition a secretary.
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
Oh.
Ive taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsons office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
Good.
You wont regret this, sir.
Fine.
Keep newspapers here, birth certificates, records of deaths, that kind of thing?
Which would you like first?
Okay.  Newspapers.
Are you alright?
Sure.  Im fine.
Mmm-hmm.  Stairs at the end of the hall.  Third floor.  Turn left. Section C-7.  Row 35, near the toilets.
Dont mention it...
Im trying to reach nine zero eight triple two.  I cant get through...  What?!...  Shit!
It is?...  Which area is that number listed in?...  Is that near the ocean?...  The ocean...  Never mind. Have a Jonathan White listed?... WHITE.  Seventeen?  All Johns?  I see...  Never mind.
Coffee?
What?  I dont drink coffee.  A cup of tea would be good.  Milk and no sugar.
Making progress?
These are the investigations of a madman.  He has fabricated an entire bizarre paranoid delusion with no internal logic whatever.  This is a mess.  A horrible mess.  Its the second time now.
Look at this!
You typed this report?
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
Wrong?  Look at this!
It seems fine.
Fine?  Look here!
How can I submit this?
Im sorry...
Do you wash your hands before you type things?
Why, yes.
Well be more careful, please.
Inspector Bumsteads office... Yes...  Yes...
Yes, sir.  The Chief-Inspector said he would see you now.
Enter!
What is it?
A formality.  I need to speak with Thompson.  Officially I need your written permission.
Why do you want to speak to him?
A hunch.  He might be able to...
Bumstead, dont be so paranoid. Leave him alone  -  hes a sad case.
Its extremely important to my investigation...
Ill be the judge of that.  Anything else?
Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...
Absolutely not.  Up to my ears in cases right now  -  cant spare anyone.
Lost something?
What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
I need something to keep me awake.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
Your sign says you sell drugs  - well, Im here to buy some.  Okay?
Relax.  Sure!
Tell you what  -  let me cut yer hair, give ya watcha need half price. Cant argue at that!
I dont want a haircut.
Cut hair when I was in the navy, yknow  -  havent lost the touch. Bet youre happy bout that.  Huh!
Sell maps?
What of?
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
Grandpa thought customers might like some mood music.
Nice...
You still look familiar.  Its driving me nuts!  Sure I dont know ya from somewhere?
Not me.
Mnunn.  Cold lately. (lathers up Whites face) That night, couple weeks ago.  That was real cold.  Remember that?
Not really...
Yeah, Im like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure cant complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this aint no fucking rug! Ghead.  Feel it!  All mine!
Yes! Feeeeel it!
Beware!  The night is deadly.  There is a criminal among us.
It could be she!  The innocent across the street!
Or the temptress next door!
Or mister nervy stranger at the back!
You are thinking it could be anyone? And youre right!  Why, it could even be Mother!
Evil stalks our streets.  It seeks to hide in our hearts.  Have you not evil within you now?
He took my little boy!  Ill rip out his eyes!
You have sinned?
NO.  Ah...
I am listening.
Theres a...  woman.  I don't know but I think I, ahh...
You fornicated?
No.  I, ah...
You seem restless.
Someones after me.
Then we must call the police.
No.  I mean...  that isnt necessary.
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
Just let me sit here for a moment? Ill go soon, and stop bothering you.
Youre the murderer?  Yes!  That must be it!  Dont kill me!
Shut up!  Listen.  Walk out quietly.  Understand?
Dont kill me!
Shut up!
Please...
Im not going to kill you, okay!
CRIMINAL!
Its him!  Rip out his eyes!
What do you want?  Tell me!
Do not make us hurt you...
It will be inconvenient, yes...
How long have you been here?
Maybe ten minutes...  Thats strange.
Spinning backwards?
Yours too?
I want prints over here...
I want to see the doctor.  It's important.
What time was your appointment?
Look!  Tell him I'm here.  Now.
Yes, certainly...  Who should I say?
No idea.  Just get him...
It has failed.
This is becoming dangerous, yes!
Let's get this over with.
What about the dance-steps!  This is my responsibility, we must resolve this issue, yes?
Sorry.
The situation has changed.  This one is in possession of knowledge...
...to avoid influence, yes.
A freak!
Impossible!
It gets interesting, yes.
Stop this!  It has gone too far! Tell Mister Black!
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
You know something about me?
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing you remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Water?
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
What does she say?  The woman.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name is.
Your name is John White.
That's what people keep telling me.
And what's this about?  Why?
Bad dreams?
Yes.
Tell me about them...
Yeah well, why don't I ask some questions for a change.
If you like.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
That's right.  I am your doctor.
Known me for long?
Well...
Am I a killer?
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
Look, you know something about me, out with it!  Let's end this bullshit!  I want answers!
We won't get anywhere like this. Please.  Let's take things in easy steps...
Put simply...  a penetration of the left parieto-occipital area of the cranium...  complicated by inflammation that resulted in adhesions of the brain to the meninges.  Without going into detail...  the formation of scar tissue altered the configuration of the lateral ventricles, producing incipient atrophy of the medulla...
Look.  It was a simple question.  Can someone kill and not remember it?
I'm sorry.  I get carried away sometimes.  Possible?  I'm...  ah, afraid so.
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
Horrible...
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
Formation of memories is the most important of brain functions.
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
I'm nothing then.
Anything but, my friend.
It feels no pain.
Can I get my life back?
Maybe.
We know of two kinds of memory. Firstly, declarative memory.
And then there is procedural memory.
Follow?
Research on simple animals can be... useful.  To show us where memory storing systems are located, for example.  I am building an experiment with hamsters next. (looks at nearby cage of hamsters) Cute little things.
Listen to me talk!  You must be hungry.
Whole damn wing lost power.  Wiring's old.  Keep meaning to get it fixed. Here we are.
Ah.  Beautiful!  Head and all!  Just how I like 'em!
I'm sorry.  About before.
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
I have to talk to you.
It can't wait?
Excuse me.  Ah, make yourself at home.
Still kicking, huh?
How are things in here?
Ah, nearly done.  So tell me about your dreams.  I'm very interested.
Just the typical fabrications of a distorted mind.  You know, chased by mysterious men in black, that kind of thing...
Ah, our friends in black...  they are not just a figment of your imagination you know, in fact none of what you are experiencing is anything but real.
I know everything about you.  You have no choice but to trust me.
Scarey, isn't it?
Are you feeling alright?
What are you doing?
I have to go...
You can't go yet.  We've got so much to talk about...
You're tired.  You need to lie down.
Those pills...
Yes.  A little something to help you relax.  Harmless...
This is madness.  If we're caught...
Shut-up.  Help me with these straps...
Now you must relax, Anton.
Leave it!
Damn!  Whoever it is  -  get rid of them!
Keys.
I'm sorry I had to put you through this, Anton. (lowers syringe to White's forehead) There will be some pain, but things will be easier this way.
Hold it!
Police.  Nobody move.
He tried to kill me!
Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
You Schreber?
What's that?
A fish, huh?
Dammit! (glances at his watch) I'm curious?  How many so far?
What?  I...
Let's see, there's the little guy with no arms or legs.  And the young boy?
Young boy?
The six year old.  Sure, you remember.
Y'know, the kid you left in the meat packing plant, cut into pieces. Packed into brown paper parcels, wrapped in twine, that kind of thing.
You sure have demonstrated a great deal of...  imagination.  The baby was the best though.  Several cops lost their lunch over that one.  Head twisted off, spine pulled out, yeech...
Stop it.  You're making me sick...
We count seven so far.  Anyone we missed?
Inspector Bumstead...  Inspector...
What is it, Crenshaw?
Just reminding you...  your eight pee em...
Dammit.  Very efficient, as usual, Crenshaw. Remind me to give you my watch.  It needs fixing.
Yes sir.
Where are we going?
Shut-up.
Shit!
Gesundheit!
I didn't sneeze.
What are we doing here?
Get out.
Wait here.
Bumstead.  I'm here to see my mother.
Brought you these.
Move  -  forward.
Left  -  profile.
Right  -  profile.
Move  -  forward.
Move  -  forward.
Watch  -  the  - wheel.
Move  -  forward.
Stand  -  behind  -  the  -  screen.
Move  -  forward.
Face  -  the  - wall.
What's your name?
I don't remember.
Oh, no?
John...
...Murderer.
You'll sign a confession?
Okay.
Visitor.
Keep him away:  He's insane.
Please, stay calm.
This man wants to kill me.
Just one of his many delusions  - it's nothing.  Shut up!  Listen, damn you!  This is a fortunate coincidence  -  we won't get another chance like this.  Listen to me.
What do you want?
You're innocent...  You didn't kill anyone.
What am I doing in here then?
Listen to what I have to say.  Decide for yourself.
What's he doing here?
Says he is the man's doctor... (taps side of his head) You know...
I know it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
Yes.  And it's SCHREBER  -  with an 'h'.
Yes.  An "h".
The men in black  -  they're the killers.
You're a liar!
No, it's the truth.
So you're telling me the truth this time?  Is that it!
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
Not that again...
Everyone get's one  -  very much like this...  But this one's special.  It will help you understand, everything...
I'm not injecting anything into my brain.
Anton  -  I mean, John, there has been an experiment, a dangerous experiment.  I arranged it.  It was a lie from the beginning.  It almost worked, but things did not go as they should have.  You have been left  - blank.
You can change this, all this. (points at syringe again) But you must take it.
You've been working too hard.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
Why?
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
Concentrate.  Imagine the syringe rising.  Picture it floating above the table.
Do it!
It's a trick.
No it isn't.  You are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
Oh, sorry...
Your  -  time  -  is  -  up.
I gave you your chance, now it's too late.  They'll learn you are here soon.  It's all over.
Doctor!  What brings you here?
Just visiting my patient.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
He's seriously disturbed...
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
Loose ends?
Bumstead!
I need to speak to you.  Immediately.
Bumstead, these...  er, gentlemen are here to collect White.
Who are you?
Please, Bumstead.  Co-operate  - it's easier.
This is highly irregular.  I have a right to know.
We are from a mental asylum.
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
I see...
Yes, Inspector.  Has he been displaying any strange...  behaviour?
He's been a little angel...
If you could show them to the holding cell now.
Where is he?
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
 How could you have been so stupid?
I'm sorry, sir.
Alright, get out.
You stay.
Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
Yes, sir.
...earlier this evening it was reported a man fitting his description had been apprehended.
...and now for a message from LUMP-O food products...
He's up here!  He raped me!  Hurry! Before he kills again!
Sachiko.
That's me.  I'm a shadow.
Do I look like a murderer to you?
Yes?...  Who is this?...  Who's there?...
John?  Is that you?
Who is this?  What do you know about me?
John.
Please believe me.  It's me, John. Your WIFE.  I wouldn't lie to you. You told me I could come and see you -  now you want to just send me away again...
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
How do you know I'm innocent?
Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
They're dead, John.
You have an uncle.  You were very close.
This is where he lives. I'm sure he would like to see you.
Thanks.
Don't you want me?   My body? Remember how my skin feels?  Touch it.  I...
What's your name?
Elizabeth.
Yes...
I want to help...
Alright.  Here...
Know this place?
Of course.  Your home town  -  where you grew up...
How do I get there?  Tell me.
That's easy.  You...
...strange, I forgot.
Yes.  Very strange.
Go away!
Open up, Thompson.  It's me...
Bumstead?
Can't let you in...  sorry.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
Not that.  Anything else.
You don't look so well...  C'mon, let me in Thompson.
I can't talk about that.  As long as you understand, that's all.
Pull up some garbage  -  make yourself at home.
They've taken my mind, my memories...
What?  Who has?
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
What is going on?
Wish I could tell you, Bumstead. Strange business.  I... AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!
Get away!  Leave me alone!
It's  -  it's disgusting, I know...
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
No...  No doctor...
But...  How long has this been happening?
A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
Sorry...
I'm sorry...  This is embarrassing  - my husband doesn't know who I am...
The line of junction between two edges!
YES!
We have located him.  Now is the time, yes.
Let the tuning commence!
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him. (indicates Sachiko's corpse) She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
The other one?
His wife.
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
No one available.
They won't come out.
We'll interrogate them anyway.
This is the family of the victim  - apparently they were in the apartment when he committed...
What are you talking about?
Oh, yes...
They don't speak English...
How will we interrogate them?
Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
It's alright.  I won't hurt you.
Gentlemen.  Doctor.
I have called this meeting for a purpose, yes?  It is clear to you we are  - unhappy, yes?
Yes, of course.  I...
The tuning failed  -  when our agents arrived he was gone.  He knows things -  predicts things.  Explain to us, Doctor.  Why is the situation this way?  Yes?
I'm not certain I fully understand myself...
No excuses, dearest Doctor!  Answers. Yes?
Answers!  Answers!
You said this would be containable! Nothing works this time.  Why is this so?
Why!  Why!
I  -  ah  -  I...  it's a little cold in here don't you think?
We must find him.  This is your responsibility.
Yes, of course...
A call, sir.
Who is it?
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Put it through...
This is Bumstead.  Who is this?
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Yes, sir.  Everything?
All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me.
Please  -  I'm in a hurry.
Certainly.
Why give yourself up?
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
Uh-huh.  What are you scared of?
People...  after me.
Who?
I don't know who they are.
Why are they after you?
Don't know that either.
Don't know much, do you?
What is your name...  What is your name...
You have duplicated the personality, yes.
It is ready.  The Doctor was most helpful.
I hear a clock in my head, and I like it!
We hear clocks in our heads, and we like it!
A world in our likeness!
A world in our likeness!
Please.  Not that way.  If you could just follow the covering  -  the carpet gets stained and it's impossible to clean.
Everything the department knows about John White is in this.  Here.  Excuse me for a moment.
Age thirty one.  Brown hair.  Green eyes.  Five feet, ten and a half inches tall.  Until recently worked for a firm manufacturing scientific equipment.  Wife's name  -  Elizabeth. Father and mother  -  Harold and Edith.  Both dead.  A history of mental instability...  etcetera, etcetera.
That stuff helpful?
I suppose...  Why are you helping me?
You're case has been driving me crazy.  You see, I pride myself on being thorough.  There's too many loose ends with your case.  Thought it was best you were hidden until we understand more about the facts.  What do you know about these men in black?
If you shoot them here... (points at his forehead) you can kill them.  They're not people  -  like us  -  got insects in their heads...  Got any disinfectant?
It's my legs.  Been bitten.  Giving me trouble.
Insects?
Here. (hands things to White) Careful with your trousers.  That stuff stains.
Here.
Any idea what part the Doctor plays in this business?
Let's try and find out, shall we. (points at White's shoe) Lace is untied.
He with you shortly, sir...
Hello, sonny.  Cute outfit.  Mother get it for you?
EEEEEEEEK...  AHHHHHHH!... SHHHHIIIITTTT!...  FUUUUCKER!!
Huh?
I didn't tell you the entire reason I helped you.  It started with two little girls.  Twins.  Used to play with them when I was young.  Couldn't remember for the life of me what they looked like, then I understood why...
They didn't have faces.
What?
That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.
Everything was liquid beneath a thin surface that had always seemed solid to me...
Is there anything you haven't told me about this business?  Even the most insignificant thing?
No.  Nothing I can think of. Except...
Go on.
Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
Why, that's ridiculous.  You just...
We'll get to the bottom of this.  I mean it.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
You are mistaken.
What are you hiding?
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
Please, they'll kill me...
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
In there.
Just like that?
What is this place?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Look.
Put them on.
Get in.  Hurry.
 Where do you think this goes?
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
Follow me, and do exactly as I do.
NIGHT OF THE EYE!  NIGHT OF THE EYE!
The Eye is too small for the head of the pin!
Yes!
What is it that floats on the water? The Eye!
Indeed!
What do we do?
Fake it!
What?
The eye.  Master of time and space!
The Eye  -  um  -  delicious with horseradish on rye!
Good.
Nothing to it...
Eye...  eye, captain!
Um  -  yes...
My spine will bend for the Eye!
Was that for real down there?
I'm afraid so.
What the hell is that?
Quick.  My car.
What now?
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
I'll go see an uncle of mine.  Five  -  one  -  eight  -  three  -  double six  -  three...
Good. (looks in rear mirror) Uh-oh...
It's empty.
Take mine.
ARRRRRRRRGGGHHHH!...  HA-HA-HA-HA- HA!!
Where did it go?
Don't know.
Jump!
Yeah.  That's what I said! (looks at White  - rubs head) What..?
I'm looking for this address.
Upstairs.  Through there.
John?
Are you alright?  What are you doing here?  Is this one of your jokes, John?  It's been so long, I thought you'd forgotten your uncle Karl?
Uncle...  Karl.
Not often I get a chance to show these.
And this is me again about  -  um  -  I would guess about twelve feet further to the right of the last shot.  Now just behind the wall is the hotel I stayed at  -  sweet little place...
Hello...  Yes, he's here... (holds out the phone to White) It's for you.
Yes?  Oh, it's you...  Yes...  My uncle apparently...  Just looking at some memories...  You have?  That's good.
At first I thought there was no way to get to the ocean...  The buildings are a barrier, no windows, no doors -  everything just, well, ends  -  only thing would be drill a hole.  But then, I saw it, one door, just one... Inside a tenement building...
We can meet later  -  but first I have to do something.  Look I got to go...
Where can we meet?...  Alright. Good...
Look!  This is a good one!
What is that door?
Which one?
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
Such a joker!  Like your father.
No.  Have a look.
You see it?
Yes.
Where does it lead?
It must be a closet or something.
Don't trip over.  It's dark up there.
John, I didn't see you there.
What is that?
Get back!
Filthy beast!  Shoo!  Go on!  Shoo!
No!
I can't wait any longer...
I'm sorry.  I told you, she is being examined...
Mister Bumstead!
We will teach the pig to meddle in our affairs.  Yes.
What is happening?
Ah, Inspector Bumstead!  We are glad you are here  -  I'm afraid we have done all we can.  Yes.  Your Mother has passed.  Yes.
But she was getting better...
We are sorry.  The cancer  -  it was fatal.
She doesn't have cancer.
We knew that.  Yes.  Anyway  -  she is dead.
I'll kill you all!
You will obey us, yes.  In your mind there is a dark space...
Nice knowing you.
White?
Hello, Bumstead.
Dammit.
Why do you always have to find things out the hard way!  Couldn't you just do your job, you idiot?  I told you, didn't I?  These people are not playing games, Bumstead.  They can do anything they want, don't you understand?
You're one of them.  You bastard...
In a way, we all are, inspector! You.  Me.  Everybody!
Time for that early retirement, Bumstead.  Didn't bring the gold watch I'm afraid.
No...  Please...
Ahhh...  it hurts!...
What happened to you?
I'm...  being...  punished.
I had to  -  ahhhh  -  find you...  I.. I...
WHITE What is it?
We are...  living in their dreams...
Insect...  dreams...
Aitch?
Gesundheit!
I didn't sneeze.
We are looking for the White victims.
And who the hell are you?
Over there.  Numbers eight to twelve.
Thank you.
John White...
There is nothing, Mister White. Beyond the city.  Never has been. Unfortunate.  Yes?
How did you know where to find me?
We knew you would turn up here eventually...  Been waiting for you, yes.  Hoped you wouldn't make a nuisance of yourself on the way...
Welcome.
John White, you are to be tried for murder, yes.  You wish to confess to these crimes now?
Very well.  The testimony of the prosecutors.  Yes.
No...  Please...
Shut up!
John!  Don't...
Stop it!  This is a lie...
Something to say?  Ready to confess?
I didn't kill anyone.
Speak up.  Yes.
It's lies.  Everything.
Bring the witnesses.
You are the accused's parents?
That's right.
Yes.
Wait a minute...
You had your turn!  Let them speak.
My parents are supposed to be dead! You can't keep changing the damn rules like this!  Why go through this ridiculous set-up!  Why don't you just kill me and be done with it!
Please, continue...
This is insane!
It was them, not me. (points at the Mystery Men) They killed you.
You have invented all this.  History is a lie, not just mine, everyone's  - a fiction.  You are the authors.
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a murderer.
You've given everybody memories, but I missed out.  The Doctor saw to that -  played your own game.  And now...
You're trying to get rid of me.
Why do I threaten you?  You're scared aren't you?
Ah  -  a plot.  Now we have a plot!  Very inventive...
Please, John, you're embarrassing us...
Shut up!
You have proof?  Evidence?  Yes?
It's all here!
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
But I...
I see. (turns to the victims) The verdict, yes...
Wait, this isn't fair...
Guil  -  ty...
Before I pronounce sentence...
How dare you use your tricks on me!
I didn't realise...
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
You'll regret that.
SHUT IT DOWN!
This has all gone too far.  Yes, much too far.
Good as new.  Yes.  Everything is easier now.
It's small but clean...  ...and the view's nice.  Isn't it?
I'll take it.
Beautiful.
Yes...
What's your name?
John...  White.
