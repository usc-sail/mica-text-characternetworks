... Thank you... ... Alright - I'll tell you why you're still alive ... but this is just between you and me, mind ... Thing is, I've got a dilemma!

 You don't know the first thing about her! ... Bet she's never farted in front of you, has she! ... Has she? ... No! ... I thought not!... it's not romantic, is it? ... you just wanted the perfumed clouds of love! ... The magicalness of it all! ...

'Ere Liz...'ere's a funny thing ... Last week, right, I went to get a new pair of shoes ... down Bond Street ... So I've popped into this shop and I've said I want that pair - those in the window - in a ten... So he's brought'em to me and I tr i es 'e m o n .. . b e au t if u l. . . l ik e slippers... bit loud for this lot but me to a 'T'... I'll 'ave 'em... Ow much?... Four 'undred and forty four pounds!... So I'm counting out the money and I can feel the assistant standing too close - like here - like his head's by my chin ... So I've eased him back a tad and I says, 'ow much were these again? ... and he's told me ... repeated it ... Four 'undred and forty-four pounds ... Tell you what, I say s. .. I' ll g iv e y ou f iv e 'un dr ed for'em... I'll get the box, he says ... but I've called him back ... 
I know you hate me.
Lovely shoes! ... Hate you? ... No-one's hating ... not in this room ... So shut your fucking mouth!
 Is that them?
 ... No... these are boots ... this was shoes ... Would you like something to drink, Liz? ... (he walks over to her with his whiskey bottle) ... Sorry we ain't got a glass ... D'you mind the bottle?
Up yer arse!
 Peanut!...  ... Apologies for that ... That was uncalled for ... Do you forgive 'im?
I didn't hear him.
... I said sorry we ain't got a glass ... D'you mind the bottle? And he said, `Up your arse!"... D'you forgive 'im?
Why'd you give' im five 'undred for 'em?
You wouldn't understand.
No I don't!
He was bein' flash!
Is it true?... Is it? ... Is it true, Liz?
Is what true?
Is it true you're expectin?
 Is she?!
 Could be!... Could be, Col!... (COLIN IS LISTENING. ALARMED. ALL EARS) ... Eh? ... A little one . .. a l ittle bastard!...

Then that'll be ta ken ca re of and we can forget all about this slack behaviour of yours...
It's not exactly BUPA, is it?!
 It's the way it's done! It's what you do!... To amend!
Nah ... you're just gettin' your rocks off! - He's just gettin' 'is rocks off, Colin!
If she were mine I'd stone 'er!
Like you've been stoning Agnes for years?

 Two years later I was dead... I passed away in the small hours in a nursing `ome in Slough, with a drip in me arm, me gnashers in a mug by the bed and me boots most definitely on!... I'd done me hip in the spring and couldn't cope with meself no more at `ome, if you must know... I died in a `orrible fuckin' room they'd give me in the midst of a bunch of doddery, decrepit, dribbling old mongs!... Come the time, this dragon-witch-bitch of a nurse, arsked me if I wanted a fuckin' priest?! To make my peace!... I arsk you!!... I told `em where to get off!... Told `em all to fuck off out of it and leave me to meet my maker on my Jack Todd!... I lay on my pit like a scabby                        * baby and waited for it... waited for it... waited for it to come... and get me! It came alright... The Reaper came, alright... in the middle of the fucking night -- Like a burglar -- Like a worry... I opened my milky mince's and saw... saw Death... The ugly brute of it... It's black mouth... it's cocky eyes... `ungry like the wolf... for me!... My time was up!     I was wanted!... "I'll break you", it said... "I'll fucking' break you!"... I stared at it... hissed at it... spat at it... I raised myself up from the stainy cot with my weak, bony arm... got myself in a proud position -- my spine ramrod straight... It was reaching for me... grabbing at me... laughing at me... "FUCK YOU!", I said... `FUUUCCKK YOOUU!!!!!"
 I've got a new boyfriend... I haven't had a steady in years... He's black, aged 21, beautiful... Works in the city... Ray!... I love that name... Ray!... Met him in a sauna... he looked at me -- I looked at him -- He looked at me... that sort of thing. Just clicked... Got talking... Learnt one or two things about each other... he can't swim -- I like cars, so on and so forth... Took it from there... We've been together three weeks now... Play it by ear... ... Yesterday... he went off to work... I fancied a stroll... `opped on a bus... Hyde Park and I'm walkin'... Serpentine... Past the ducks... I see this rowing boat... man rowin',.. He turns... looks at me... still rowin'... It's him... It's Ray... The boyfriend... We don't acknowledge each other... and I just carry on walking... ... Is he a liar or shouldn't I have been there?... What d'you reckon?... I know what I think!
 ...I've met someone... Her names `Azel!... I was a bit nervous at first... fear of the unknown I s'pose... well you get set in your ways, don't ya... anyway, I like `er... like `er a lot- `s a nice feelin' -- an' she says she likes me an'' all! -- So you never know -- watch this space!... And Mum an' her? -- Do they get on?
 ...They get on brilliantly!!... I'm taking them to Ikea this afternoon... (raises his eyebrows. Intimate with us). Say a prayer for me!
 Be lucky, Liz.
