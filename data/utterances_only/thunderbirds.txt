From a secret island in the South Pacific, the courageous Tracy family run an organization called International Rescue. When disaster strikes, anywhere in the world, they are always first on the scene. They go by the name they gave their incredible machines, the Thunderbirds.
So, gentlemen, we all know that A2 plus B2 equals... C2, that's right. But what happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's E, F and... (Teacher notices Alan looking out window and not paying attention to the lesson) Mr. Tracy!
Alan. Alan!
How kind of you to come back from outer space, Alan. I trust re-entry wasn't too rough?
I was just...
Apparently not (she picks up his notebook which he has been doodling in) "Thunderbirds are go."
"That should keep you busy. Yeah, well you can take your 10,000 words and stick them right up your..."
Alan!
Headmaster.
Mr. Tracy!
Miss Garrett.
You gotta be more careful Alan.
Why can't I tell 'em I'm a Thunderbird Fermat?
Because technically you're not a Thunderbirds yet. And if your identity was discovered, it would a d-d-di- it could be very bad.
I know, I know.
It's the Thunderbirds. They're gonna be on TV. Let's go! They're gonna be on TV.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where are they?
In Russia, at an oil rig fire.
Great! I'm stuck at school and my brothers are on another cool mission.
Wanna watch?
Yeah!
We are told this super-rig is now in danger of total collapse.

Come on! Come on!
Scott, get out. That tower's coming down.
Got it.
Thunderbird 1 any damage?
Negative, Dad.
Come on, come on! Swing around. You can't get close enough, taking that approach angle.
This approach angle's no good. Gonna have to swing her around.
Watch the wind shear Thunderbird 2.
Scotty, I was watching for wind shear when you were still wearing diapers.
Come on, Dad.
Whoa! Hold on!
Who needs the diapers now, Dad?
What do they do now?
Probably drop the rescue platform from Thunderbird 2.
Open 'em up. Here we go. Rescue platform's on its way.
Virgil, how's it going?
It's looking good, Dad.
Come on! Jump!
Okay, I've got a visual. Hold it there. Targets locked. Firing rescue lines. (Directed toward the

Alright, let's haul them out.
Commencing reverse thrust.
Okay, let's bring 'em home.
Look out! (a couple of crew members bump into each other as they are hoisted up)
Man they gotta get 'em out fast. That rig's gonna blow.
Hang on!
Whoa sorry, boys. Hold on tight. Here we go.
Come on, Virgil.
Hold on guys
How you doing, son?
Never better
Thunderbird 1, commence knockdown procedure.

As you can see the fire has been extinguished. The rocket fired from Thunderbird 1 has
That was great work, Lisa. Thanks a lot.
That's another good one, diaper boy.
Tracy! (after finding Alan in the sea of boys he continues) There's someone here for you.
Sure beats the bus!
Definitely!
Fantastic. Now, will any of these gorgeous young things be joining you?
Just Fermat.
Quite right.
Lady Penelope, why are you in America? Are you on a mission for my father?
Alan, shh! I am an undercover agent, so please try to be discreet. (camera pans over to
Hi, Parker.
Good afternoon, Master Hackenbacker.
Hi, Nosey.
Less of that attitude, or I shall be obliged to deliver the Parker Haymaker.
Okay, bring it on, big guy.
Try not to run over any children, Parker.
Very good, milady.
Come on, Parker, chop chop!
All right!
Whoa!
YES!
Yeah! the boys high five
Oh, look, Parker. Pink is the new black this season.
I'm very glad to hear it, milady.
And hemlines are going up.
That is good news, milady.
Oh and apparently England won the football last night.
Yes! Eng-er-land! (his hands go off the steering wheel and the car begins to move to one side)
Calm down, Parker.
Yes, milady. Sorry, milady.
Come on, baby. Out you jump. (Turns to her teenage son who has a pan stuck on
Even better! It's the Thunderbirds!
OK, lock it up. Let's go. Let's move it. Hey, we need some help over here.
Mission complete. Thunderbird 1 we are good to go.

Ah, the chariot of the gods. Having dallied with the mortals,
Pardon me, milady. Approaching Tracy Island. And radar indicates we have some company.
Now, that's showing off.
I wish that was me.
I'm about to run post flight checks, Mr Tracy. Anything I sh-sh-sh-

Dinner's ready. Come and get it.
Onaha, it smells delicious. I am starved.
So Dad, I saw the mission on TV. It looked dangerous.
Saving lives is a dangerous business. But it's what we do.
Do you think the fire was caused by thermal up draughts? I mean that would explain the-- (Jeff
Whoa, whoa, whoa, enough shop talk. I want to hear about school.
School's boring. Plus I've been thinking, maybe I could be home-educated now. That way, I could
No short cuts, Alan. No school, no rockets. Say, why aren't you wearing your retainer?
So I'm getting the reading telling me that the wind is blowing 60 knots, right up my keister.
No kidding.
Did you try readjust the flaps?
Well that's the first thing I did, Sprout! It's not my first day in a Thunderbird you know.
Try and keep up!
Yeah and don't you have homework to do or something?
Unless he's blown up this school, like the last one!
Yeah, keep Alan away from the ships, he's a hazard.
Okay, that's enough. Pass the salad.
Man, I haven't seen that much fire since that volcano in Fiji.
That wasn't Fiji that was Istanbul.
No, no, Istanbul was the earthquake.
Yeah well, nothing compares to Argentina.
Dad, I'm not really hungry. Come on, Fermat. Let's go.
But! I'm not done!  Okay.
Kyrano, have you seen Lady P?
By the pool.
Of course.
Parker.
We're not supposed to go in there. We could get in trouble.
Ah, you worry too much.
Where'd you get the access code for Thunderbird 1 anyway?
Fermat, my friend, what you don't know, can't hurt you.
I'll be right there. It seems the fire at the oil rig was no accident.
Any suspects?
Not yet, but I'll keep you posted.
Thanks for bringing Alan home.
My pleasure. Any excuse to visit paradise.
Tintin!
Hey, Mr. Tracy.
Hello, Tintin.
Good evening, Lady Penelope.
Did you know Alan's home?
Alan's back? (changes her tone to a more pleasant one) I mean, oh,
When are those two going to get along?
When Tintin decides the time is right. Girls always fire ahead of boys with that sort of
What sort of thing?
Romance.
Alan and Tintin? I didn't see that one coming.
No, you wouldn't.
Have a safe flight home, Penny.
Thanks, Jeff.
Okay, Fermat. Run pre-flight checks.
Right. Hydraulic systems are green.
Commence main engine sequence.
FAB, Alan.
Couldn't hurt to just fire up the instruments.
No wait, Alan! That's the(Thunderbird 1 begins to start up and Fermat shouts) Wrong switch!

It just did.
I can't believe it.
We're so b-b-busted.
Look at this.
What is it?
Looks like some sort of, gallium-electrolyte compound.
We gotta get out of here.
Dad, I know you're mad. I shouldn't have been in the ship, but if you just give me a minute to
You're damn right you shouldn't have been in there!
But, nothing happened Dad. I had it under control.
Under control? Do you have any idea of the importance of secrecy in our operation? You fired up
Yeah, I understand. I understand you don't want me to be a Thunderbird. You don't want me to
I've heard enough. You're grounded for the rest of spring break.
But, Dad!
Bottom line, Alan. You need to grow up.
Then let me. (he stalks toward the door before whispering,) Please!
Hey, John. I was just about to turn in. What can I do for you?
I could sure use a pizza. You know a place that delivers?
30 minutes or it's free, right? Anything else on your mind?
Well, got a forest fire in Vladivostok, a typhoon heading for Singapore. What's happening on
Alan's home for spring break.
Yeah, I thought I could see a storm brewing in your region.
Teenagers.
Well, we've all been there. And Dad, you've done a great job since Mom died.
Thanks, John. Keep an eye on that typhoon for us. And, uh, I'll call Vladivostok, see if they need

Morning, Dad.
Hey, son. There's something I'd like to sh-sh-sh- Here, take a look.
The neural-net control system?
It's great to have you back. I bet you didn't think spring break was going to be this w- w-fun.
And that tiny phone lifts up, perfect.
Dad?
N-n-n- Almost perfect.
There's something I want to talk to you about.
Oh. Right. Oh. OK, right. You're having problems with a g-g-g-chi-chi-chi-wo-wo-female?
N-no! No. Alan and I found some sort of gallium compound on the nosecone of Thunderbird

How about a little warning next time you pull a stunt like that?
Relax, Fermat. It's just a little water.
I could have drowned.
You mean you can't swim?!
I repeat, I could have drowned.
I said I was sorry, Fermat. Just put this behind us, Okay? We gotta watch each other's backs.

No, milady. And the media is awash in speculation vis--vis their whereabouts. Parker turns on
Over to Lisa Lowe.
Chuck, disaster after disaster around the world today and still no sight of the Thunderbirds.
I think it's time to send the emergency signal, Parker.
I fear you're not wrong, milady.
Lisa Lowe. Back to you, Chuck.
I'm telling you, Fermat, it was like The Hood was inside my head back there.
What do you mean, Alan?
Maybe he can read minds or control minds or something.
Don't be silly, Alan. Everything can be explained by science.
I'm just trying to figure out his weakness. Everybody has an Achilles heel, right?
My Achilles heel is actually my Achilles heel. It's got a blister the size of a basketball. Tintin!
Stop?
Yes!
No!
Okay.
No more cheeseburgers for you, Fermat.
Any word?
Nothing, milady.
Right. You will have to tell Lord Marlborough that I've broken my shooting arm. We

It's the guidance processor.
What's wrong with it?
There isn't one.

No way. They're dead. No one could live through something like that.
I did. Get them, Mullion. Take whatever you need. And make sure you get the guidance
Alan, don't you think Tintin is blossoming?
Blossoming?! What's that supposed to mean?
Come on, Alan. You've a c-crush on her.
You've got to be kidding. I mean, she's. She's not that bad, I guess.
Okay, guys, take five.
Five isn't going to do it!
Guys?
Don't move.
 Whoa
What is it?
Hexdrotilous scorpion.
Is that dangerous?
.025 milligrams of its venom is fatal.
So, dangerous is in fact an understatement.
Watch out!
Tintin, what was that?
Let's get going.
Hey! She has the same powers as her uncle, The Hood.
You think?
Must run in the family. Did you do that?
Just drop it, okay?
Still think everything can be explained by science?
Not girls!
Scott? Gordon? You all right?
We're okay.
The heat exchanger has blown.
You don't say.
Come on! Those brats are in here somewhere.
How we doing Fermat?
Don't rush me Alan. This is very d-delicate equipment. Which is

Yea- Maybe, but I'll need something to solder with.

They're onto us! We're being jammed!
Can you finish?
I'll try.
Alan, what's happening?
Hang in there Dad, one more minute, okay?
It's not going to work Alan. The signal's too weak for data transmission.
Dad, can you hear me? They're jamming the signal. We're going to lose you. Don't worry, I'll
That's a negative! It's too dangerous. Follow emergency procedure. Wait for Lady Penelope at the

Alan we're losing you! Alan!
Dad!
No!
Useless!
It is now.
I'm sorry, Alan. This is hard on all of us.
No, it's okay. I'm fine.
You don't have to be such a tough guy Alan. I'm worried about my dad too.
I'd do anything to be with my parents right now.
But The Hood knows we're alive now. We have to go.
Even worse, they know exactly
Where we are!
Come on!
Great, more water.
Tintin, can you slow 'em down?
I'd be delighted.
Then do it. And meet us at the junk yard. Come on, Fermat.
This'll get us out of here.
There! Come on!
Straight ahead.
It's gonna make this thing hard to control you know.
No problem.
You really must be careful not to exceed four bars of boost or else
I said no problem.
Guys, let's go we've got to get out of here. What is this?
It's a hoversled.
It's our ticket out, unless you've got a better idea.
Yeah, let's wait for Lady Penelope, like your dad said.
 Here.
Great plan. Let's sit and wait to get caught. I say we do something. Now! Right, Fermat?
Actually, I agree with Tintin. I don't think this is s-s-safe.
You don't think anything is s s-safe.
Just because I s-s-stutter doesn't mean that I'm wrong. If we're a team, we should make
Do you guys want to sit here and take a vote? Or do you want to get out of here? Cuz I'm going.
You can be a real jerk sometimes.
Go! Go!

Come on! Faster!
Alan! You're going too fast!
I need more speed to get above the trees. Hang on!
What'd I tell you guys? (looks down and sees Fermat and Tintin being captured.) Oh, no.
What are you doing?
Oh, no! Not the fridge!

Hey son.
Sweetheart, are you okay?
I'm fine, Dad.
 Cool off, kid! (he

Re-entry into Earth's atmosphere in 37 minutes.
Oxygen's out in 30 so we won't feel it.
Stop it!
Come on, Dad. The situation's hopeless.
No, it's not. There's still time. We've got people on the ground working for us.
Alan? He's just a kid!
He's a Tracy.
This doesn't look good, Parker.
No, milady.
That bougainvillea is absolutely parched, and someone should do something about
 Whom do we have here? Mullion.
I must warn you that I know judo, krai magna, and tae kwon do.
And I know Parker.
Milady.
 You've broken my nose.
Yes, that was very much the intention of the maneuver.
 Whoa!
One tries so hard in life to sort things out on an intellectual-slash-conversational level.
 Shall I bring the car around, milady?
Parker, have a bit of a lie-down.
 Excuse me, milady. (punches him and after that has no

Big oaf! (The fridge door closes leaving them trapped) Right, that's quite
So, how does it feel to be right all the time?
Not b-bad, actually.
I'm so sorry, Fermat.
We make quite a pair. It's hard for me to t-t-talk. It's hard for you to l-l-listen.
Parker, I have an idea.
Excellent, milady.
Brains, how long do Jeff and the boys have?
I can't think. I'm too c-c-cold.
The guidance processor has been installed.
Thunderbird 2 is ready for takeoff.
What is our ETA?
Under an hour. Bank of London, here we come!
We've got to be quick. The Hood's getting away.
In position, milady.
Here we go.
Yes!
Good shot, milady.
Come on, Parker. Let's give the bad guys a good
 This seems to be a six-lever mortise, milady.
I love it when your checkered past comes in handy Parker.
Thank you, milady. Unfortunately, I fear I shall need a piece of wire to access the mechanism.
Will this suffice, Parker?
Most certainly, milady.
I didn't actually need it, anyway.
Of course not, milady. (Parker gets the door open)
Quick! They're getting away
Okay, everyone get to the control room.
Hat.
Get in there quick, Fermat, and save my family. Then we'll get The Hood. Good luck!
Looks like they slipped a backdoor key into the access codes.
I'll follow your lead, son.
 Thunderbird 5 come in.
How long have they got before re-entry?
90 seconds and counting

Looks like we're good to go.

We're fine. We still have a job to do. Where's The Hood?
He's in Thunderbird 2 Mr. Tracy headed for L-L-L
London.
She's right.
He's got the Mole on board.
Looks like Thunderbird 3 lost a booster, Dad. We'll never get there in time.
Let me go after The Hood. He'll destroy everything you've built everything the Thunderbirds stand
Negative. I'm sorry it's too risky.
I can do this. You know I can. What am I saying? (Puts his arms around Tintin and Fermat) We

Roger, Brains.
Situation update, Thunderbird 3 is about to initiate separation.
Boys, Thunderbird 2 is in final approach to London.
I know The Hood's weakness, Fermat. I can stop him if we get there in time.
Stand by. We're going to maximum thrust.
Whoaaaa!
Gordon, heat 'em up.
We're getting reports of some kind of incident in London involving the Thunderbirds. Lisa, are

Set a course for the vault.
Sir, if we continue on our present course, we'll sever the monorail's subterranean supports.
Stay on course.
But sir, we'll cause a major disaster.
No, we won't. The Thunderbirds will.
Let's get her down, boys.

Yes, milady.'
Ride it out, boys!
The Hood's getting away.
Those people can't hold on much longer.

We're the Thunderbirds. Our duty is to save those people. Brains, we're going into the accident

Where's Thunderbird 1?
It's on the ground. The k-k-kids are in Thunderbird 2.

Look at all this gold!
Stay focused, Mullion. Nine more banks to go.
Fermat, deploying Thunderbird 4 in three, two, one, Thunderbird 4 is go. I can see the monorail.
Don't panic, guys.
Fermat, I'll hold the monorail in place. Can you get a line on that stanchion and lift it up?
I can't get a clear fix on the target. I might hit the passengers.
I'll go and fix it myself.
What you mean swim?!
Get me as close as you can.
How are we doing on that line Fermat?
Just look out your window.
Come on, Tintin, come on!
Come on. Come on, Tintin. You can do this. (Tintin successfully connects the rope to the

FAB, Alan. Commencing reverse thrust.
That was amazing, Tintin.
Thank you.
Nice job, Fermat.
Nothing to it, really.
 Easy does it.
There they are!
 Glad you could finally join us.
Hey don't get cocky after one mission. We still have a dangerous situation. I need you boys to
Okay let's clean it up guys.
We got to get to the Bank of London fast.
Lady Penelope went after The Hood.
I know, she may need help.
Ashes to ashes, diamonds to diamonds. Lady Penelope. What an unpleasant surprise.
Don't be rude. I can't tell you what a pleasure it would be to use my little finger to pull
Mullion. (uses his powers to knock the gun from Lady Penelope's hand)
That's not cricket.
I'm sorry. The only part of sport I ever liked was winning.
How ghastly.
Hey, Dad. That stuff The Hood said, about you leaving him to die. He was lying, right?
No. See, you can't save everyone, Alan. It doesn't matter how hard you try or how brave you are.
What was Mom like?
She was a lot like you. Come on, we've got a job to do.
Finish her off, Mullion.
Shame on you. I always despise a man who delegates the important jobs. (sees the
Good timing, Parker.
Good afternoon Mr. Tracy.
Come with us.
My pleasure, Mr. Tracy.
The Thunderbirds. They're here. Kill them all.
Alan, you guys stay here with Parker. I'm gonna go find Lady Penelope.
But what about The Hood? (Alan points behind Parker) Look out, Parker! (When Parker turns
Master Tracy!

Alright, that's enough of that.
Don't move. (Parker motions for the kids to run forward but Transom
Go on, then.
No, sorry. I can't hit a lady.
Allow me. (she kick Transom and runs off, Transom chases her)
I've been waiting to get my hands on you brats.
And I've been waiting to get my hands on you.
Ow, now that was a punch.
Parker, can we wrap this up?
What did you have in mind, Master Hackenbacker?
Strategically speaking, the best odds of success lie with the Parker Haymaker.
I concur.
Penny!
Jeff, no!
Did you save them all this time, Jeff? Or did you leave someone behind?
I didn't make you what you are.
It's not me you have to convince. (motions his head toward the entrance of the room
Leave my son out of this- (the Hood uses his powers to throw Jeff into the cage that Lady
Jeff!
Dad! (Alan runs toward the closing cage door and reaches it right as it slams shut) Dad! Dad!
I'm disappointed in you, Alan. I thought we were kindred spirits.
Well, we're not. I'm Jeff Tracy's son.
You certainly are.
No!
Alan no! (The Hood uses his powers to throw Alan off to the side where he slams

You want so desperately to walk in Daddy's footsteps. (uses his powers to lift Alan off the
Let him go.
Did you really think you could challenge me?
Let him go, please.
Let him go.
Please! Let him go! (the Hood tightens his hold of Alan and then releases him)
Alan! Are you all right?
Alan, get out. Run!
He's getting weaker. He can't last much longer.
Neither can you! (Alan begins to climb up the Mole to reach the Hood) Alan, no! Look out! (The

Goodbye, Alan! (Steps on the other hand and Alan yells in pain) (Tintin runs into the room)
No!
Ah,  (She uses her powers on him as well) Oh!
Leave me, Alan. Leave me to die. (releases one hand from the railing) Like your father did.
I don't want to save your life. (the Hood lets his other hand go, but Alan grabs it) But it's what we
See you soon, Jeff.
 Now, that was definitely showing off.
Hey, Scott.
Get him!
What did you put in these margaritas?
It's a Tracy secret.
That's my boy! One more week and you're gonna be swimming like a F-f-f-D-d-d-
Good job, Ferm.
So, what do you think?
He's getting there. Whoa, Tintin! You're just really, um, blossoming.
Ew! Did you say "blossoming"? (smiles at him)
Gather around everybody. I have an announcement to make. Tonight is a special
Mr. Tracy!
Thank you, sir. (Camera pans quickly over to Parker who is tearing up)
Congratulations, Alan. No short cuts. You earned it. You all did.
I'm not usually an emotional man, but sometimes even the toughest
 Hey, way to go,
That's my boy, Alan! That's my brother. (Fermat and Alan are thrown into the pool by Scott,
 Yes, Madam President. I see. Of course, straightaway. Boys.
Of course it does. And quite right too.
