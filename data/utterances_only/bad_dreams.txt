 --where did she go...? ... was here a moment ago... Cynthia, come on, honey, we need you... Cynthia, come out, come out wherever you are... the sun's going down, we're losing the moment...! 
...There you are, you naughty girl! You almost made us lose the sunset... Come on, honey, time's wasting...
 No, please... I... I really don't want to do this... Can't I just wait for you..? I--I'm not sure about this--
Easy, Cyn, easy. You don't want to do this, that's okay... right, Harris?
No, Victor, it's not okay. Here at Unity House, some things have to be done...  ...in Unity. This is one of them.
Cynthia, do you trust me?
And have I ever lied to you?
Then I say to you now... to all of you now... that this will be the Ultimate Joining... of man and woman... parent and child... humanity and Godhead.
Cynthia. Come. There is no shame in this. No crime. No sin. Just the final break with the old world... As night falls, we start a new day... a day of Unity.  Come to me... my lovechild.
No!   No...
Cynthia, come back! We can't do it without you... We must have unity, my lovechild... Unity, now and through eternity... Cynthia, you cannot run... You belong to us forever--!
What have we got?
Twenty-four bodies, Inspector. Maybe more.
Cause of fire?
Some kind of explosion... gas main, methane, too soon to tell. God only knows.
Let's hope He doesn't keep it to Himself.
We got one! We got a survivor! Get a stretcher and oxygen over here, STAT!
 Make room, make room! Get that airway in! I got a pulse, whoa, it's faint... Talk about lucky, she musta fallen in the basement... First and second degree burns... Come on people, move your asses!
 --Authorities continue to investigate yesterday's mysterious explosion and fire at Unity House, the controversial New Age commune headed by self-styled Guru Adrian Harris. 32 people died in the blaze.

Debbie. What happened to your windsurfing lesson?
No wind. I changed shifts with Nancy.  Well... time to weed the vegetable patch.
 No... no... it's wrong... someone... please help...
Holy shit...
 Twelve years, two months...   nine days.
Is that like a world record for a coma or something?
Actually, no. The longest one on record is 37 years.
Does she remember anything about the fire at Universe House?
 Unity House. No, she appears to have no memory of the accident itself or the days leading up to it. It's not uncommon after serious trauma.
What happens to her now? Have her family or friends been notified?
We stopped looking for any family ton years ago.. Right now we"re planning to transfer Cynthia to Dr. S.A. Berrisford's Neuropsychiatric Clinic. It's right here on our grounds, and Dr. Berrisford is familiar with both the neuromuscular problems a patient like this will encounter as well as the inevitable mental readjustment that will be required. Thank you.
Good... Very good... Come on, just a few more steps...
 I... I can't... I have to rest...
Young lady, you've had fifteen years of rest.
Now walk to the end of that platform, or you won't got any chocolate ice cream.
 I... I hate chocolate ice cream.
Then walk to the end of the platform, or I'll shove an entire gallon down your throat.
 That'll be all.
 Am I supposed to know you or something?
I've looked in on you from time to time... but that's hardly an introduction. You've been transferred into my care, Cynthia. I*m Doctor S. A. Berrisford, Consulting Chief of Neuropsychiatry and head of the Berrisford Clinic.
 C-consulting Cheev-- Chief of--
Oh, forget all that.   Just call me what my staff does.
What's that?
God.
What... what kind of doctor did you say you were?
Obviously, I'm not a surgeon.  I'm a psychiatrist.
 Why do I need a psychiatrist?
Cynthia, you've been out of touch with reality for over ten years. Your recovery goes beyond your muscle tone... You have to ease into life... into interacting with other people again. Into a world that's changed so much that sometimes I get confused by it. (taking out an appointment book) Now, my assistant Dr. Goldman has a group therapy session every day... I'm putting you down for it, starting tomorrow...
 Group therapy? But--
Dr. Berrisford?
I'm Lieutenant Wasserman. I left a message with your secretary...?
 And I left one with your desk sergeant.  I told you this would have to wait. You shouldn't even be here--
I've waited fifteen years. That's long enough. Now I want to speak with Miss Weston.
Miss Weston is still recovering and is in no condition for a prolonged interrogation.
 Then don't prolong it. I'll be brief with her, I'll be gentle with her--
I'll let you know when she's ready--
E--excuse me...
Doctor Berrisford, what's this all about...? This man wants to talk to me...?
 That's right, Miss Weston. I just have a few easy, simple questions.  About you... and about Unity House.
 Why is he talking like that? Is he one of your patients?
Lieutenant Wasserman is a police officer. And the word "patience" isn't part of his vocabulary.
Miss Weston. What's the last thing you remember before...
--Before the accident?   Nothing.
Then how do you know it was an accident?
Lieutenant!
I remember... a beautiful sunset. Harris, smiling at me...
 Harris, he was the leader?
Leader, founder... chief cook and bottlewasher...  Executive in charge of Dreaming. We were all together... all working to make a now world... That last night, there was a...  Gathering... a... a sort of... baptism... And then...
I'm sorry, that's all I can see.
Miss Weston. This "Unity House"... was it a cult?
I'm sorry.     I don't understand the question.
A "cult," Cynthia. A syndrome of society you have been fortunate enough to miss. They're popular with impressionable people, the penny press...  ...and lazy policemen who like to blame them for crimes they can't solve.
I was there that night, Doctor. I watched them stack those bodies... 
If it was an accident... fine. If it wasn't... the person responsible could still be out there.  And he's probably as interested in Miss Weston's memory as I am.
Feel better.
I don't like that man.
That makes two of us.
But as long as you're here...  I can keep him away.
Well, now that we're all here, we can begin. Cynthia, I'm Dr. Goldman, and I'd like to welcome you to our little group. I don't know how much my colleague Dr. Berrisford has told you about my methods. I have my detractors... but I have my successes, too! We're going to get you out of your depression... We're going to got you out of your neurosises... We're going to got you out of that hideous hospital robe and into a flimsy revealing negligee--one with the little holes here? I can see us now on a desert island... You, me, a portable waterbed--
Ralph, sit down and cut out the shit, okay?
Dr. Goldman, I was on the verge of a major breakthrough, and you blew it!
Ralph?  Cynthia. I'm Doctor Goldman--at least, last time I checked... 
What's a borderline personality?
Don't ask him. He's making this up as he goes along.
A borderline personality is one that can't be accurately placed on the Neurosis-Psychosis arc. As a personality syndrome it encompasses identity crises, chemical addictions, emotionalism, anxiety-
 You forgot VIOLENT MOOD SWINGS!
He also forgot suicidal tendencies. But, as one whose previous reincarnations stretch back to Ancient Atlantis, well, suicide is meaningless anyway.
And don't forgot binge eating.  Gourmet binge eating.
 I told you he was making this up.
If everyone is finished--
 They're not finished, Dr. Goldman, they won't be finished until they have her feeling as miserable and pathetic and confused as they are.
I am confused--
See?  I hope you're all happy--
Dr. Goldman, I... I don't really know what I'm doing here. I mean... I don't think I meet your description of a Borderline Personality--
Give yourself some time, Cynthia. We'll help you work on it.
--and I don't really know what I'm doing here.
Didn't Dr. Berrisford explain?
He said he thought that this would help me... fit into the 80's.
Honey, you want to fit into the 80's, you're already two divorces, one condo and a yeast infection behind. Why don't you just catch up with the 70's and move to Cleveland?
If I can offer a more practical suggestion... Why don't you talk, Cynthia?
Talk...?
About something close to you.
Stop beating around the fucking bush, Goldman! Just come out and ask her!
 Do you have to be so crude?
Come on, Cynthia. Dish out the dirt. Tell us all about Unity House.  The last gasp of the Age of Aquarius. Building a better world through... what? Chemistry? Good vibrations? Tie-dying your undies?
I'm sorry to disappoint you. I don't have those kinds of stories.
Back off, Miriam. Cynthia, just tell us about the orgies.
Ralph, I'm going to bore you.
What we felt... what we believed... was that if people could become selfless enough, if they could free themselves from their egos, they would experience a... togetherness. A... oneness. A Unity. That's where the name came from. We had a dream about a perfect society based on trust. On love. On totally committed togetherness. We weren't trying to change the whole world. We were just trying to change each other.
 Bullshit.
No.
It's beautiful. It didn't matter if it worked. All that mattered was... you tried.
 Exactly!
Gilda hasn't said three words in three weeks. And now, Cynthia comes in with this love, peace and Woodstock routine and... presto. Am I missing something, or what?
She's espousing a total belief system. A kind of holistic healing matrix not unlike the dynamic energy shift model. Isn't that interesting? They're adopting it, embracing it.
Too bad we can't follow through on this.
Why not?
Dr. Berrisford, the people in this group... some of them are deeply disturbed. Cynthia doesn't belong with them-- an experiment for one session, fine, but in the long run--
Alan. We've opened primary channels of communication. You've opened them, Alan. Let's not rush to throw away our progress. Neuroses are hardly contagious. A few weeks in the group won't hurt Cynthia. With luck, she'll overcome her memory trauma. That would mean progress... not to Mention getting Lieutenant Wasserman off my back. In the meantime...
She seems to like you. See if you can get her to open up, and let's press on.  With a united front?
A united front.   Sure.
Drop down to first gear, honey. It's Miller time.
What are these? Vitamins?
Beauty secrets from the orient. Look what they've done for me.
Ralph, you in a cooperative mood, or do I have to tie you up again?
Promises, promises.
Open.
Next time I hit lower.
She's crazy about me. (watching Cynthia's workout) You're coming along. A regular Rocky.
Rocky?   The flying squirrel?
Rocky the fighting Stallone.  
You're making this up...      aren't you?
Sounds like a complicated world. How do you handle it?
Well, whenever it gets to be too much, I just let all of the negative stuff out of my body.
You mean with meditation, yoga, what?
Nah. I just make a little hole and let it all escape.
Uh-uh, here comes the assistant Ayatollah. See ya.
"Ay-a-toll-ah..?"
Buy you some lunch?
Sure.
I'm impressed.
Impressed enough to call me a cab?
I'm not sure I follow you.
I've been talking to Ralph. He told me about his... personal therapy program.  And I've been watching the others... Dr. Goldman, they belong here. I don't.
 Please, call me Alan. Doctor Goldman is my father...  ...and my grandfather. I think my first baby toy was a stethoscope--
You're changing the subject...  --Alan. I'm feeling stronger. I'm getting used to things like VC esses and MCDs. I want to leave.
 Your parents died when you were a child. We haven't been able to locate any relatives.
Where would you go?
I guess I'd just look up some of the old hands from Unity House... crash with them for a while...  ...do people still say "crash"--?
Cynthia...  There aren't any old hands left. The fire that injured you...? It took everyone also with it. They're all gone.
I knew there were deaths...   but... everybody?
I'm afraid so. Look, Cynthia... I'm not saying this to upset you, but the sooner you realize that that whole phase of your life is over, and move on, the better off you're going to be. Why don't you bring this into the open... talk about it in group? Oh, here's our ride.
 Talk about it...?
Could somebody hit one?   Thanks.
 "Talk about it in group." Is that the answer to everything around here?
Nobody ever said it would be easy. And it works for a lot of people.
 It's not working for Ralph... or his chest.  Can't you at least transfer me... get me in a group of people with problems a little more like mine--
Cynthia, we don't have a lot of patients who've been in a coma for over a decade!
You'd think with what they charge here they could pay their electric bills
Relax. They're probably giving shock therapy.  "It works for most people".
Oh, great--
Jesus, lady, relax! We're on the ground floor--
Let me out! Let me out--!
Unity, Cynthia...   Now and forever!
Let me out, let me out!   Alan, help, help--!
Cynthia, you cannot run...      You belong to us Forever--!
Cynthia..?
Cynthia, what happened--?
It's him!     It's him!   He's alive--
Who's alive?
 He's alive! Right over--
 --there...
--hallucination, flashback, I don't know what to call it-
How about psychotic episode?
No, no, she doesn't fit the pattern--
Addictive personalities can be borderline. You know that--
 She has no history of drug abuse--
There's other kinds of addictions.  we see it in these fringe religious groups... these instant creeds with pseudo-Messianic delusions. You've heard how she talks about Unity House? Perhaps that's her drug. Perhaps she's going through a--withdrawal of sorts. Her memory lapses about Unity House are equally symptomatic... There's some violent turmoil under that pretty little facade.
 You put her in the Borderline Group and she became one?
No.
I believe she went into that coma a disturbed young lady. Fifteen years later... nothing has changed.
This one's new.
It'll help you sleep.  Sort of a post-elevator cocktail?
 Pay up. Twenty bucks.
Who's there?
 Cynthia?
Cynthia?   It's me.   Victor.
 Vic? Oh, my God--
Look at you.  Little Cyn.  Not so little anymore.
Vic, this is just... fantastic, it's the most incredible...  But... how can you be here?
Yeah.   It is after visiting hours--
I mean... they said that...      that everybody died.
 Do I look like a ghost to you?
 How did you survive? How did you find me? Is anyone else--
Whoa, whoa. It's a long story...  Let me tell it somewhere else. I feel like I'm in, like, the Pentagon or something.
Then let's go AWOL.
Zeke!   You've still got Zeke!
I... did it by memory. I tried to imagine... what you'd... look like today. Guess I came pretty close.
It's beautiful. More beautiful than I ever was.
 Then you need a new mirror.
That's Chairman Meow.
You still haven't told me how you lived. I really can't remember anything about the... accident.
It wasn't an accident.
A lot of people back then, they hated Unity House. Hated Harris and his dreams... dreams of peace... of oneness. That hate fed negative energy into the cosmic vortex... Something bad was bound to happen. That hate was so strong... so envious of what we had...
 Oh, fuck--
You've cut yourself--
I guess talking about the past can be a little dangerous.
Let's drink to the present.  To us.
To us.
 To... Unity.
Oh Jesus!
Victor?
Oh, my God. I can't believe it. What a great idea...! Too amazing! Too amazing!
Is something wrong?
Not wrong, Cynthia...right! The most right thing in the world!
Are you going to tell me your little secret, or should I just got dressed?
I'm sorry, Cyn, but I just got the most incredible idea. It's absolutely beautiful! Do you want to know what it is?
 Yes!
I was just thinking about what we were doing here together...
I should hope so...
Wouldn't it be incredible if, right at the perfect moment right when we're coming, if we did it?
Did what?
What we were meant to do, of course.
 ...meant to do...?
That sunset. That last night.      At Unity House. Remember?
No...     No, Victor, I don't...
 They all got to go. You and me... we got left behind... while they went on.  Guess that's why they say life ain't fair. Well...
--we can fix that.
 My God, Victor! Put those away--
This is so great! I mean, I've been living with all this shit, thinking about you, searching... going nowhere. And you, hell, you don't fit in with Ralph and Miriam, those other flakes... Berrisford and Goldman, they're a waste of time--
H-how do you know about them? I never--
Yeah. We had the answers, way back then. Unity. Unity, now and forever. Cynthia, this is our second chance!
Okay, you do me, and I'll do you-- but wait until I say go! Hey, get rid of the sheet... Let me see that grown up body...
No, Vic. Please.       Please!   I don't want to do this!
Yes, you do. You know you do.
No!
Oh, Cynthia, it's so beautiful.
God, God, no--
We're on the edge of space and time.
Oh, good... good... ummm... ummm...  Cynthia, it's happening. Put the gun to my head.
Jesus, Vic, no!
Yeah, oh yeah...     oh, YEAH--
No!
Vic?
Vic?
Where are you going?
Jesus, Vic. I thought you... left.
Me?    Leave you all alone?
Vic?   Vic, are you... happy?
That...  ...has to be..  ...the stupidest question I ever heard...
I mean... with... life.   With... being alive.
What are you talking about?
 Never mind... I had this... bizarre dream...
Welcome to reality.
What's the matter?
Cynthia?
Why did you pull away?
I...    I think I'd better go.
Why?
Please let me out.
I don't understand...    What did I do?
Nothing. It's not you, it...     it's me. I just want to go.
You know, maybe you belong in that clinic, because this, this is crazy! We were having a good time--  I'm sorry. Look, what we were feeling... it was special.
--it was Unity.  Unity, Now and through Eternity... Cynthia, you cannot run...
You cannot run... You belong to us Forever--!
Apartment 2-B, right?
Right.
2B or not 2B, that is the question.
B..but...     it... it's empty!
Of course it is. I     don't show rented apartments.     Anyway, what you see is what you    get... one bedroom, gas range,    yadda yadda yadda. 
This... this is impossible... Alan, I was here... He was here-
 How long has this place been vacant?
'Bout six weeks. Couple a deadbeats... their damn kids tore the hell out of it, too--
Alan, I don't care what she says, this is it! Look, look--  There's a double-door closet in there on the left.
 Well?
Cynthia, a double closet isn't exactly a positive I.D.--
What are you two talking about? You wanna rent, or what?
There! There, look--that's where I spilled the tequila...  See? See? It's still wet!
 Hon, I think that's from the ceiling...
...damn plumber was supposed to fix it last week.  So! We in business?
Twelve hours! You wait twelve hours to tell me about this? Am I supposed to be grateful for your civic-mindedness? I told you the Unity House case was still open--  --and she's the only lead. You should have called me the minute you found out--
 Found out what? Lieutenant, if I called the police every time one of my patients experienced a fantasy or a delusion, you'd have to move in here--
 It was not a delusion! Victor Lunes was here--
The security guard didn't see anyone--
Then the security guard needs glasses! Alan, tell them--
 The apartment did match her general description--
--a one bedroom flat with a beige rug... that's rather... generic.
--Victor isn't generic--
Victor is dead! Dead for fifteen years--
--you've seen his body?
--it was burned beyond recognition-- but there was I.D.--
I knew it--I knew it-
Cynthia. Look... we've all done it... tumbled out of bed positive that we've just lived something that was only a dream--
 Damn it, it wasn't a dream--I was out there--
No one's denying you flow the coop, Miss Weston... You wanna prove the rest? Lemme get a policewoman to stand by while a gynecologist checks out your plumbing. We'll see soon enough if your ghost left a calling card--
You bastard.
You...  --experts!
Wonderful! Wonderful! I've been waiting and waiting for her to finally show real anger--real emotion! This could be a breakthrough!  Thank you, Lieutenant.
Hey.   Anytime.
Okay. First off, we're all going to feel a little silly and maybe look a little silly...
 Especially in that shirt you're wearing, Goldman...
 --but this technique works, and we're going to release some of our hidden aggression. Who's going to go first? Lana?
 How many helpless goose had to die to fill those stupid pillows?
 None, Lana. They're polyester. Ed? Want to start?
Nah. Let's talk about the geese again. Nice fat ones, with all the trimmings--
All right, how about if we all start together and eliminate the wimp factor. Come on.
 Okay. What are we feeling?
 We used to do something like this in the royal palace in Atlantis. But we used bags of dried kelp.
Your brain is a bag of dried kelp--
 Ralph. Miriam?
 I'm pretending this is my first husband... No, maybe my third...  Can I have a baseball bat?
Please, people, let's work at being serious.
I know you had a rough night.   But you have to participate.
Okay, that's better. Now let's hear some emotion. Let it out. yell! Scream!
You failed me, Cynthia...   You failed all of us...
We were supposed to be together... in this world... and in the next...
It was going to be perfect, all of us taking the same journey... You shouldn't have run. You made us wait for you while you slept... all those years.
The waiting time is over, my lovechild. It's time for you to join us. In Unity...
In death.    You know you want it.
You know we're your family...
...You have no choice...
...Come to us, Cynthia. It's time to die. Don't lot another take your place. Come to us... now.
NOOOOOOOOO--!
 ...They... they sang songs as they stacked up the white containers... they were... happy. Because it was going to be their break with the world... a world that didn't understand them. I don't remember if they took a vote or if Harris just... decided. But they all agreed. They were... happy... smiling... laughing... crying from happiness as he drenched them in the gasoline...
 --Jesus--
Somehow, I... I knew it was wrong... I ran... When he threw the match, I was at the other end of the hallway... There was a flash... and a... like a wind, or the hand of God--picked me up, threw me... The ceiling fell in... When I opened my eyes...  I was here.
 If that's what happened, why didn't you find any evidence of arson?
The plastic jerry cans would've burned up before anything else... We knew there'd been an explosion... We just didn't know how or why.
Well. You must be pleased. Closing a case after... what is it, twelve years?
Who says it's closed?
What's that supposed to mean?
When the fairy princess here woke up, she said she didn't remember anything about 32 deaths. Now she remembers they committed suicide... 
That man's a candidate for shock therapy... with a car battery right to the cojones.
No... he's right.     I am guilty.
I'm guilty of lying... to Unity House. I promised to be part of it... Forever. They expected me to keep my word.  They still do.
Well, Alan. Still think she doesn't belong in the group?
Nothing like a hot shower, huh?
Cynthia?   Cynthia?   Are you okay?
What?
Are you all right?    After that session today, I--
I'm fine.
I think... you're a decent person... not a... mean spirited witch like some people...
--and, well, if you need a friend here...
 All my friends are dead.
Lana, wait a minute, she didn't mean it--shit.
I know Lana's a mealy-mouthed little prude, but she means well. I probably pull her chain too much... She's reaching out, like all of us. Try and help her.
I can't even help myself.
 Be cleansed!
Cleanse the heart of your mind.
Cynthia.     You are part of the whole.
Cleanse the heart of the mind!
Cleanse the soul of the self!
Cleanse the spirit of the body!
 Cleanse the spirit.
Cleanse.
I warned you, Cynthia. I warned you someone else would take your place.
--He killed her--he killed her because I broke my word... He said he'd take someone else, and he did... She wanted my help... my friendship... That's why... he took her...
Move it, people, this ain't a sideshow... Get back to your rooms...
 Fascinating. 
 I think she's fucking freaked out about Lana!
 Possible.
 Did you see the swimming pool this morning? The cops are all over it... Fingerprints, photographs...
Next they'll send in the fucking coast guard. Lot of good it'll do Lana.
Ralph, we're gonna start billing you for these outbursts.
Drowning isn't so bad... I remember when I died in Atlantis... It was like failing asleep. You know what's bad? Burning. When I was in the great Fire of London, well, let me tell you--
Connie, I don't know about your previous lives, but in this one, you're a shithead.
Honey, you can't blame yourself. Lana was an unhappy girl. Sometimes unhappy girls do foolish things.
She didn't kill herself.
It was Harris.
Harris?
From Unity House. He comes to me, Miriam. He talks to me. He reminds me that I was supposed to go with them that night--
Go with them--
Through the fire. To the next world. They waited while I was in a coma... He told me that if I didn't join him, he would take someone also... and he did it, Miriam, he did it!
You...   you don't believe me, do you?
I believe that you believe it. And I also believe that shooting you up every time you get the heebie- jeebies ain't gonna do shit for your real problems. We gotta get you out of here--get you to some nice place at the beach or the mountains where you can fight your demons in your own way. Right?
But I don't know anyone.   I don't have any money.
You know me.
 And you have money, right?
Look. Despite popular opinion to the contrary, I have not always been the career borderline psychotic neurotic that I am today. Up until a coupla years ago I was a writer, a reporter, a damn good one too... Hell, I really kicked some ass with that Selectric...
 I was on the staff of a magazine... Well, some people called it a rag, but it was home: ME! Magazine. You heard of it?
 I was in a coma.
Oh, right. Well, when they took me off to the funny farm, Saul--he's the editor--he said I was always welcome back. Maybe this is the time. See, if I can go to him, tell him your story, I could get a big advance... I'd share it with you, and we'd be set! I mean, girl, your story has everything... death, hospitalization, weird rituals, maybe a little romance-- I've seen all those longing glances between you and Goldman-
What--!
--and now with poor Lana we got a little mystery. Hell, you're not an article, you're a goddamned mini- series!
I...   I don't know...
Cynthia, let me be honest. This is a great story, and it means a second chance for me, so, okay, there's some self interest here. But I really think you need to tell people about Unity House... about the way decent ideas and dreams got twisted into something sick and poisonous. You owe it to the world. You owe it to yourself. It's your life, and you have to ask yourself how you want to live it...  --if you want to live it.
Let's do it.
I think I know a way to make a phone call. We'll have you out of here tonight.
Cynthia.    This is the right thing to do.
Of course it is.
Uh oh.     Mum's the word.
 Ladies. Good to see you socializing, Cynthia.
Yes.  See you later. And...     thanks.
Thank you.
How are you feeling?
Fine.
Good.
No!
Miriam!    Stop!
Cynthia?
 Miriam, get out!
Cynthia!
Cynthia!
She's trying to get away!
Cynthia! We want you to stay with us! You mustn't be afraid!
Please, no.
She's over here.
No pain, Cynthia. There's no pain. Come with us. Share with us. Take my hand.
Take my hand.
Cynthia, take my hand.
Jesus.
Cynthia, it's really quite beautiful.
They want us all now. They want us with them. Whether we like it or not, we're going,
Cynthia, we're all upset by what's happened. But let's not get--
Harris promised us eternal bliss on the other side when we're all together.
Eternal bliss....
Eternal bullshit--!
Miriam was going to write a story about me. He killed her because she was going to help me got out of here.
Cynthia, please...
You're not listening to me! He wants us all to die! He wants you all with them, and it's because of me!  It's all because of me...
Dr. Berrisford, what would you call two suicides on your promises so close together?
I'd call it a tragic coincidence. Unfortunately, Borderline Personality Disorder is indicative of a pre-existing disposition towards suicidal tendencies.
What about the commune girl? Has she confirmed that the fire was some sort of mass suicide?
As that is a police matter, I am not at liberty to comment on it.
Speaking of the police, doctor, isn't it true that they suspect that the recent deaths may not have been suicides at all?
That's completely absurd.   Where do you get this nonsense?
 From Lieutenant Wasserman. He confirmed to me that he's assigning some of his officers to the hospital grounds until further notice.
 Doctor Berrisford, are you cooperating with the police? Dr. Berrisford, do your patients have a history of violence?
Ah... I have work to do.    No further questions.
You're in pain, Cynthia.
Your pain is my pain. We share it all, because we have our love. 
I didn't want you to be alone.
Looks like I was right.
What are you doing here?
You know me at feeding time.
 Why didn't you tell me before that you were a Prince of Ancient Atlantis?
It slipped my mind ...    your Highness.
They'll have bed check soon.   I know a better place.
I don't know if you want to hear this or not, and frankly, I don't care.
You are no more responsible for those deaths twelve hours ago than you are for the ones twelve years ago.
Thinking otherwise is putting you in a self-replicating spiral of depression. And that puts me in a bind... What do I do, write more prescriptions? You need to face reality, not get medicated out of it...
Damn it, Cynthia, you can't run away from this--
It's Harris--he's going to do something to Connie--to Ed--!
Good! Get mad--get angry--but not at me--at these fantasies--!
 Nectar from the grapes of Atlantis!
No fooling you.
I'm so happy.
Miriam and Lana were both deeply disturbed women. Miriam tried to kill herself before. Lana was obsessed with the morbid... You heard her in the sessions. You can't twist what they did into something other than what it was.
Now what?
Damn it, Cynthia, come back--!
Shit--!
It's just overloaded circuits. Everyone, please go back into your room.
The turbine room upstairs? All right.  We'll set it straight in a minute. Somethin's caught in the turbine.
Hurry.
Goddammit.
What the hell?
Cynthia--!
Cynthia.   Cynthia.
Connie?
Cynthia.
Cynthia, we're up here!
Come with us, Cynthia!
You must join us, Cynthia!
Cynthia, you must reach out and embrace our love for you... You must reach out to me...
Where are Connie and Ed?
They're with us now.
Where are they?  Where are Connie and Ed?   Where are they?
Where are Connie and Ed?
It's all right--it's all right--
--horrible--sweet Jesus--help me--
What the fuck is going on?
It's Ed and Connie.    They're dead, aren't they?
Yes. We're not sure what happened... There was evidence that they were drinking... They fell into... the main turbine.
Fuck... Look, Ed drank before. Lots of times. Didn't know that, did you? But he didn't usually decide to jump into a mix master, man!
Ralph, as for your own safety, you are being given the most amount of protection possible.
The police are powerless.    Ask Cynthia. She knows.  Harris wants us all.
Jesus Fucking Christ!    I'm getting the hell out of here.
Now what?
Lieutenant Wasserman assigned me to you. Where you go--
I get the picture. Try not to shoot me or your fat ass, okay?
Isn't this a coincidence?
I'm getting out of here.
Believe it or not, this is the safest place for you to be. The police are here. There are doctors here. And I'm going to keep you company, all night. I even brought provisions.
Pure unadulterated junk. At this point, who cares about the chemicals?
Try harder next time.
 Connie and Ed aren't going to be the last.
Yes, they are. Everyone's under protection. Nothing can happen.
Everything okay?
Yes, thank you, officer. Hey, lemme buy you a cup of coffee.
 Sounds good to me.
 Just a sec.
Ralph? What is it?
Nothing. I just came to tell you-- (smiling, conspiratorially) Everything's gonna be okay.
What's going to be okay?
What happened to your hand?
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay.
Ralph?
 Ralph?
Ralph was just here.   His hand was... all bloody.
Dr. Goldman, have you seen Ralph?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
He didn't take his four o'clock. If he misses this one, I'm gonna...
Shit! It's his tranquilizer! If he doesn't take this, he'll completely flip out--!
Look.
Are you sure you know where you're going?
Was he behaving strangely?
No more strangely than everybody also in this place.
 I can't get him. He must be shut off.
Hey.
Cynthia!
Ralph, we have to go and get your medication.
Relax.
Ralph, I'm not going out.    We have to go back upstairs.
Ralph, please!
I have to talk to you.
It's very, very, very, very, very important that I talk to you.
Ralph, you're not being yourself. Can't you tell?
No!   This is the real me!
I come down here a lot. It helps me unwind.
Ralph, please! How do we get out?
It's been said by better men than me in better ways in better times-- there is no way out!
Help!
There are only a few chances for real glory, and most people fuck it up. Most people can't even find the noses on their fucking faces.  You want an example? How about EVERY FUCKING DOCTOR in this entire hospital? Do you think I'm just going to let myself slowly dissolve into nothingness here?!  I'm talking about a glorious glory. And everybody's trying to drag me down!
Ralph, please, they said you have to take some pills.
Pills have got nothing to do with it! You know what I'm talking about!
No, I don't. I don't.
You do! Real glory, hallelujah! The great big gig in the sky. Don't play dumb, Cynthia.
I think you know the word I'm searching for.
U, N, I, T, Y! Unity!
Oh God, Ralph! No!
Yes, oh, yes! Eternal bliss!
Ralph, please, stop!
Ralph!
 Get back.
Join us, Cynthia.
Join us.
Join us.
They're in the basement.   The girl's alive.
You're running out of patients, Doctors.
What did she say happened?
She's having a little trouble with reality--as usual.
 Goodbye, Alan. Thanks for trying. But it's time for me to go now.
I have to go with her.    Where is she being taken?
Isolation.
 Isolation? Are you out of your mind? That girl needs human contact--connection--isolation is the worst thing you can do--
Dr. Goldman, I know you're fond of the girl, but you're out of line.
Shit. You want her on the edge, don't you... You want to play your theory out to the end--
Goldman!
 Theory? Anything I should know?
It's an extraordinarily complex situation, severe identity crisis compounded with the multiple shock of these deaths. She's reverting to this total belief system from the commune through an intermittent psychosis that puts ideology above her life itself--
Fuck ideology! Fuck you, Berrisford! You can't use a human being as a guinea pig--  You have to stop this. Call it off--I'll--I'll sign her into police custody if I can stay on as her physician--
Doctor Goldman. I believe your tenure with my clinic has just come to an end.  Security? Would you please escort Dr. Goldman off the premises?
Would you like to come in?
No, thank you.
It's time, Cynthia.
--Excuse me, Dr. Goldman?  I'm going to have to ask you for your key card.  Dr. Berrisford's orders. I'm sorry.
Tell Berrisford he can use it for a bookmark. Maybe then he can find his dick without a road map.
We're gonna miss you around here, Dr. Goldman.
You were always the favorite.    We love you. Come with us.
Why are you doing it to everybody else? Why don't you kill me?
Why don't you kill me?
You have to do it yourself, honey. When you didn't... he took us instead. But we're not mad. It's wonderful here.
You mustn't be afraid, Cynthia.
if I can do it, you can do it, honey.
Why don't you kill me?
Why don't you just kill me?!
Hey.
You have to join us because you love us. You have to do it for yourself.
You have to do it for yourself--  --lovechild.
But I'm so scared.
You want me to call the doctor, honey?
Try to sleep, all right?
Hey, get out of here!
 I can do nothing for you now, but know this--the answer you seek is inside of you! It is inside you!
Get her out of here!
 Know yourself and you will be at peace! It is so!
Yeah, I'm taking her back to her room... Okay, bye.
I know you'd come.
But you're too late.
It feels good. I know this is right.
That's right. You need our love. We need your love.
I know this is right.   We'll all be together.
Brilliant. Do we feel better now? No. Yes. Maybe.
 It's okay, officer. I'll write myself a prescription in the morning.
Good work, Dr. Goldman.   Now, it's your turn.
Need a light?
Goldman, you look like shit--
 Show me the scrips for the therapy group--
Come on, man, I can't do that-- it's Berrisford's show all the way--
Shit, this is all standard stuff--
What do you expect?
Do you fill these prescriptions?
Nah, Berrisford does it. He comes in every morning and sets up the medication for the day--Hettie takes it as she needs it--
Fuck!
Hey--!
Read it.   Pesco, Ralph--
He's dead--
READ IT!   What's he down for?
Ah, Lithium--four times a day--
Is that Lithium?
Fuck, no--that's Endoral--the complete opposite--one of those, even a normal person would flip out--
Tell me about it--
What's this? And this?      And this?
This is, uh, dextroamphetamine... Christ, take one of these and you can walk on the ceiling. Holy mother. Methylphenidate! Don't mass with that fucker. Clonodine! Chlorapromazine! Preludin? Shit, I didn't know they still made that... Two of these and Mother Teresa would turn into a maniac!
Tetrahydrocannabinol! Do you know what that is? Liquid condensed marijuana! Just thinking about that stuff gets you wasted.
Hey, Goldman, come back here! Who's gonna clean up this mess--?
You're not supposed to be here, Dr. Goldman, are you?
Please, Hettie, I need your help.
Now.
Cynthia!     Cynthia!
Sometimes doctors got personally involved. I think it's a mistake. You've got to keep professional.
Get some rest, Goldman.   You look like shit.
Oh, no!
Get out of here. I want to do it!
 No. Cynthia, please. I'm not going to be able to come back, but you have to listen! Berrisford's been tampering with the medication for everybody in the group--that's why they've been committing suicide--he's been making them crazy--
But Harris comes to me...   He speaks to me--
A drug induced psychotic state is very suggestible. All we've hearing for days is "Harris, Harris,"... so that's what we all saw... That's what I saw when I took Ralph's pill! It's all part of Berrisford's plan--he has this fucked-up theory about how you still think you're part of the Unity House, and the only way he can prove it is if you want to kill yourself!
Do you hear me?! He's going to want you to kill yourself! He's recreating the whole thing for you! But you can't listen to him!
Dr. Goldman.
No...   no... no...
Only one thing matters.
Our love.     We'll be together.   All of us.
Shit!
One at a time! No pushing!      Please do not use the elevator!
Where's Berrisford?
This is your fault! These goddamn doors won't re-lock!
 Where is he? He's going to kill Cynthia! Tell me where he is!
I haven't seen him!
 Cynthia, take my hand... Just relax... Think about what you're doing... Stay calm... I want you to take my hand...
It's so beautiful.
 You piece of shit!
No!
Cynthia!
Cynthia! Open your eyes!   Open your eyes!
Pull up! Pull yourself up so I can got a grip on you!
Let me go.
No!
Let me go.     I saw it.   It's beautiful.
You didn't see shit!       Hold on!
Eternal bliss.
Yes!   I want to go!    Let me go!
 Let her go. She needs it.
No! Cynthia, Harris doesn't exist! He's dead! Look at who that is! Look at him! Look!
Goddamn you! Goddamn you!
Let her go. Let her go and I'll forget your disobedience. 
Publish this, asshole!
 Don't you hear him? He's trying to bribe me--but I'm not letting go! I'll go with you, but I'm not letting go!
Cynthia, help us! Help us both!
You'll be with them, Dr. Goldman, Be happy.
No!
S...stop it... Stop it!
Cynthia, don't let him kill you! Don't let him do this!
Unity... It... it's my destiny... I've fought it too long. Right or wrong... my death has a purpose... It will close the book. End the story.
Your life has a purpose... to bring joy and happiness! You're part of my life now. That's an unfinished story, too...
Let me up.     Stop it.
Let me up!
I'm afraid it's too late for that.
Dr. Berrisford?
Jesus  Gomez, get up here!
Holy shit.
I need a detox prep! Stat!
It was him...
It's okay. It's over. It was Berrisford. He killed them.
Then all those other things... Faces... voices? They were...      in my head?
It was Berrisford. He shot you up with hallucinogens. What he didn't do, you imagined.
Go right if that's the interstate. Yeah, it is.
Victorian. Looks like it was a nice house once.
Yes. I guess appearances can be deceiving.
It's dead.     It's really dead...
What?
It's over.
 --letters of support could have an influence on the court... You know, from your peers--?
 I have no peers.  Hello, Lieutenant.  Forgive me for not getting up.
Real funny, Doctor. Try this for laughs: As soon as you're ambulatory, you're going in front of a Grand Jury, and you're going to be charged with six counts of obstruction of justice and two counts of assault. 
Well. I don't agree with your definition of justice, but I suppose I obstructed it... All in the name of science, of course--
 Doctor Berrisford--
 --but as to murder, well, Lieutenant, I beg to differ. I didn't kill anyone. Why would I? I'm only interested in knowledge. Cynthia is a unique girl--the product of an environment and a philosophy unrivaled in its purity. I wanted to understand the depth of her commitment, the link between psychosis and total immersion philosophies, the dark terra incognita of the human psyche--
 Hey, go chow on a Latin dictionary, okay? You can bullshit all you want, but how do you account for six bodies?
Clearly some unknown variable was a factor.
Yeah? Well, if you didn't kill off the therapy group, who did?
Lieutenant, I'll put it in terms even a policeman can understand.
It beats the fuck out of me.
What's the matter?
I was just thinking about Gilda. Somehow, she knew. She kept talking about "him," but I didn't know what she meant. She said the answer was inside me. Why would she say that?
Let's go.
You go down. I'll be out in a minute. I just want to... bury some memories.
You sure?
Cynthia!   Are you staying for supper?
Cynthia.   It's good.   Come in.
Cynthia, I'm so glad you're here.
Cynthia, it's so wonderful here, but we miss you terribly.
It's time, Cynthia.    It's finally time, isn't it?
Yes.
 You don't exist.
I wouldn't say that.  Go on. Take the knife.
Do it.   You know you want to.
You know you do, Cynthia.
You'll see how beautiful it is.
You will.
Cynthia, we're only telling you this because we love you.
Beautiful lovechild. All will be in balance when you've joined us. All will be right when daughter is with father.
You're special, Cynthia.
Scared blood... daughter of the father.
I'm...?
Now you remember.
Yes...
My own beautiful lovechild. Everyone has proven their love to me. Now you must.
No!
No I don't! I don't love you!      I don't need you!
I never loved any of you! I hate you! I hate you all! What you did was wrong!
It was WRONG! It was stupid!
 Oh, Cynthia.
I never needed you!    Any of you!
I never did...
Cynthia?
Are you all right?
Let's go.
It's going to be okay.   I'm going to be okay.
 Come on, where are you? I hope you're not in that house... You always got like this and make stupid threats that you don't mean!
If you're not here on three, I'm history. Permanently. One... Two... Three! Fine. Good riddance.
 Who are you?
A friend.    You're upset.
What would you say if I could promise you eternal bliss?
Eternal bliss? What do you mean?
