 Daddy! I don't want you to go!
 Your father has work to do, Sonny ... but he'll be home soon. And we'll all watch it together.
You promise, Dad?
I promise.
Daddy ...  Daddy, is E.T. gonna win?
He's got my vote.
 I want you back early. Tonight's the night those little starlets are crawling all over town.
Don't worry. I'll beat 'em off with a stick.
Daddy (wants him to stay) What about my joke?
Knock knock.
Who's there?
Old lady.
Old lady who?
I didn't know you could yodel.
 Take my advice: Don't give up your day job.
 Karl ... wake up.
 I'm here, Mase. Where are you
On the Harbor ... south of Torrance. I got Calabrese right in my gunsights.
If I had a Sidewinder missile, I could save the taxpayers a lot of money.
Here he goes. I'm shutting down the radio, partner.
Keep off the skyline, amigo.  Lou Gossett just won Best Supporting.
Let's go, boys.     I'm missing the Oscars.
 I know you, Calabrese. But who are these mystery guests?
-- Murder is a serious business, my friend. And an expensive one.
Slowly ... slowly. Always with caution.
All I'm counseling is a little patience. The man is public. He's in the paper every day.
We'll do it.
 Who are you? Get out of those shadows --
 You told us this dock was clean --
 A quarter's a quarter.
Mikey! Quit playing with yourself back there.  Mikey --
 Whoever that sonofabitch is, I don't want him to get an hour older.
He won't, Mr. Assemblyman.
Karl -- Storm on three.
You throwing away dimes now?
This doesn't go out over the air, pal. For your ears only.
 What's going down?
Calabrese. I just got his ass -- on candid camera.
You're full of shit!
Him and his gorilla Vitale. I got film and audio on both of them, laying out a hit. Two other guys I couldn't make out, but I'm sure they'll come up on the film. This is a big one, Carlito. Our own academy award. You ready?
 Shoot.
I want you to track down Morgensteen right now. If he's with that meter maid from Pico, crank her legs apart and pry him out of there.
He ain't gonna be happy.
Screw his happiness. Tell him I want the lab open at six-thirty tomorrow morning. I want this film pushed to the max, and nobody but us to know about it. I know we got something here.
You bringing it in tonight?
I promised my kid I'd be home. I'll be at the lab before dawn.
How ya doing?  Got any champagne?
Right next to the caviar.  There's some in the big cooler.
You're not watching the Oscars?
The Oscars?    I hate the Oscars.
Who needs the goddam movies? I get it all in here every night. (indicates his view from behind counter) Horror. Sex. Freaks. Violence. And I ain't gotta pay no four bucks.
 You got a phone back there?
Why ?
 Punch nine-one-one.
Sonsofbitches! You creeps ripped me off two weeks ago!
Shut up.
Take it, man.   Take my life's savings.
Where is a cop when you goddam need one? (to Punks, threatening) I got half a mind to come out there and teach you sonofabitch --
Now you got half a mind, old man.
What are you grinning at, pindejo?
We ... ell ... there's only three of you and you only got one shot left.
 I know what you're thinking.    I have this big shotgun and all   you have is that little icepick.    Mine's bigger than yours. It's not    fair.
Still not fair?
Don't wait for the blindfold, maricon.
 Chinga tu madre!
You were armed, Storm -- why didn't you just use your gun?
I just got these new glazer bullets. You know they're almost a buck a pop now?
I know that voice.
Wish I could sleep like that.
Maybe I can help you.
Is that for me, Dad?
You faker.
E.T. lost.
Who won?
I dunno.   Candy.
Candy?
 Mahatma Candy. He was a great man.
 You know why E.T. lost?
Why?
Cause they only let grownups vote. If kids had voted --
 -- We would have gave E.T. everything!
We would have given him everything.
Yeah.
 Daddy -- tell me a knock-knock.
You know the rules. (pulls covers up) One joke a day. I have to make 'em last.
There's blood on your jacket.
It's okay.   It's not mine.
If people knew how sweet you are, they'd never be scared of you.
I'm not scared of you.
Maybe you should be.
 Why? Are you planning on doing something to me?
A couple of things crossed my mind, in the car coming home.
 Door's open.
 What?
 Man.
 Get to work.
 You got the tapes?
 I got a shitload of 'em.
Punch it.
Jesus Christ.
 knew Storm from when I was City Attorney ... and he was a young homicide detective - (choking back tears) We worked on... cases ... together  I'm sorry ... sorry --
That was Assemblyman Vernon Trent, deeply moved by the loss of an officer he knew, .
What makes people do this?  Will you tell me? Will someone please tell me?!!
 Holland! Captain Holland!
They always said Storm was superhuman. Now we know why he was always jacked up on coke!
 Let me tell you something, you piss- ant. That man in there was the cleanest I ever knew -- with more honor and guts than this whole department put together. If I ever hear you say fuck all like that again, I'll lose my shield to put you where you belong.
 What the hell's I.A. doing up at this hour?
Taking over the show.
This is Homicide, not Internal Affairs.
We got two cops down, with money and drugs all over the place. This is straight from the commissioner.
You and Storm were tight, O'Malley. I'm sorry.
He was the most unstoppable sonofabitch I ever knew.
Well.
Excuse me, are you with the police?
 Lieutenant O'Malley. What've you got, Doc?
I've got a live cop, is what I've got.
The paramedics called it wrong, so did my people at first. Look... it happens. The man had no vital signs. With all the blood and excitement, I almost missed it myself. But we have a pulse now. Your man is alive, Lieutenant.
Who else knows he isn't dead?
No one ... just the people in her. But --
I want to see each one of them before they leave the room. No one else comes in as of right now.
Hold on.     I don't think you --
 Mason Storm is going to vanish, Doctor -- and you're gonna help make it happen. Until he can give us some answers, the deader he is, the safer he is.
-- The governor today appointed dashing L.A. Assemblyman Vernon Trent to the Senate seat vacated by the tragic death of --
You're early again.
 You won't report me, will you?
 Inquiring minds want to know --
-- Dr. Cannon ordered a glucose drip on Jimmy See. Mack's E.E.G. monitor's developing a nice electronic hiccup -- and your boyfriend... (indicating Storm) ... turned his head.
 He did?
 I thought he was going to sit up. I almost shit!
 -- Can you hear me, John Doe? I don't care what the doctors say, I know my words are reaching you somehow. 
I'm going to  talk to you tonight... and tomorrow  night ... and the night after that.  I'm going to keep talking to you till  you come back --
Yogi said it ain't over till it's over. Till the fat lady sings. There's life in you, J.D., I feel it. I'll never give up on you, and you'll never give up on yourself --
Besides ... you've got so much to live for.
Sorry.   I won't be long.
How's the sleeping prince?
Still sleeping.  It's bad enough when it's old people. But a young handsome guy --
Don't let this job get you, honey. It's eight hours, not twenty-four. Get out, meet somebody ... get laid --
 You can have my orgasms, Martha. I'll make up for 'em later.
 -- Nurse ...
Internal affairs. Detective Sergeant Jones.
My name is Andrea Simpson. I'm calling from U.C.I. Medical Center. I'd like to speak with (reads from card) Captain O'Malley.
What is this in regard to, please?
I have a John Doe coma patient, code access 461 zebra, with instructions to notify upon any change in condition.
What is the change?
 The patient has regained consciousness.
 Nolan. Get Holland at home ... right now. (back to Andy on phone) I'm sorry, Ms. Simpson. Captain O'Malley is no longer with this division. Let me take your information. Please ... contact no one else on this matter.
-- Clip him with 50 cc of Thorazine if he gives you any trouble. I'm afraid he's very disoriented and quite paranoid. He thinks people are trying to kill him.
Miss ... please ... they won't tell me ... think I'm too disorient --
This is U.C.I. Medical Center. You've been in a coma. Your charts go back for seven years.
 Seven... years?
Who ... who knows I'm awake?
 It's all over the hospital. You're the first one that's come out of a coma of this duration. You'll probably be on the news!  You'll be famous!
 -- Andy. I don't have the strength to talk much. I'm a cop. My wife ... family ... murdered. That's how I got here. If you don't get me out ... you and I ... good chance ... both be dead.
Please -- you're in no danger here.
Goddamit -- (urgent but weak) can't stay here. Listen to me -
I'll have one of the aides take you down the hall for hydrotherapy. It'll help you relax.
No --
Listen... I've got work to do. You're my cutest patient, but you're not my only one.
Excuse me, Doctor. I have to check everyone on the upper floors. (comes forward, no suspicion) Can I just get your I.D. --
 Russ!   Russ, are you --
Sonofabitch!
My God!
 -- Help me ...
I'm sorry!    Sorry --
 Six gang-related murders in one week. We're going to put a stop to it -- and we're going to start right here!
I'll be talking with the mayor. We'll have a statement shortly --
 How much dirt do I have to shovel into this goddam Storm's grave? 
Jesus Christ!  The man is flat out on a stretcher and you still can't kill him!
Holland -- plaster his ass with slime in the press. Put a tail on every person he knows --
We know how to do our job, Senator.
Then start showing it.  I'm starring in that sonofabitch's home movie -- and the Oscar is thirty years in the slammer. He's toast, understand?
 We're going to end violence in this state -- and you can take that to the bank!
Seven years.
 -- Stay tuned for more of: Best of Geraldo!
Geraldo?
 Senator Vernon Trent promises:   No new taxes!
 And you can take that to the bank!
 -- If you want to sleep with me ... you better wear a Pharoah.
 Pharoah condoms. The only safer sex is no sex at all!
 can't come in to work, are you crazy?! I can't even go to my apartment! People are dead, Martha ... no, I can't tell you where I am ... you're better off not knowing --
 I am freaking A.W.O.L. I mean, what am I gonna do with this guy --  I want to help him... my God, he needs it ... but it's all over the T.V., he's some kind of crooked cop with drugs and murder and --
It's okay -- I'm here, I'm with you.
 Yeah,   that Esposito. The ignorant fuck   who's broadcasting the news right   now.  Tell   him it's Storm. Mason Storm.
 I can't stay here. They'll trace you from the hospital in two --
 I told you -- no one knows I'm here! I'm house-sitting... (out of patience, frustrated and frightened) This place belongs to a doctor friend of my parents. He's in China now, on research... won't be back for six months. The medical center only has my apartment address. Even my friends don't have this number.  Will you believe me?! We're safe here.
 Esposito?  Listen, you sonofabitch --
We'll find your friend O'Malley. We'll just keep phoning ...
Listen.     I'm getting out of here.
 I'll buy tickets to that.
I just need some food -- and a few days to get my strength.
Days?   Try a few weeks.
You helped me, okay? I'm grateful. But every day you keep helping puts you in more danger.
 Danger is my middle name.
I've been dead, Andy.      You wouldn't like it.
Hey, hey -- I don't think you get the picture here. Your muscles have been getting electronic stimulation at the hospital, but it's not like actually being up and bearing weight.
You're the one who doesn't get the picture. 
First of all, I ain't no fucking invalid! And second, I don't have time --
 Mata Hari -- at your service.
Just some herbs I need for my recovery.
No problem. This is on my list for Safeway every day.
 That bad ... huh?
I'll be in the other room.
 -- This reporter was contacted personally by the now-infamous 'Coma Cop'... fugitive officer Mason Storm -- who until days ago had languished in a seven-year coma.
 Storm gave me his word that he is innocent of all charges preferred against him in the press -- and that he has access to indisputable proof of this. Battling the atrophy caused by seven years of hospitalization, Storm is struggling even now to regain the strength that will enable him to come forward with this evidence. He has promised me and the K.A.B.C. audience a first look at his alleged proof.
 I want 24-hour surveillance on this sonofabitch.
 I told you -- Andy's out of town. I just came by to pick up her cat.
Where out of town is Andy?
I don't know.  Look, I've been questioned by you cops half a dozen times since Tuesday. I'm getting a little tired of it.  You need a warrant to walk in on someone like this. Get the hell out.
Then I'll get out.
We'll ask you again, Martha:     Where is Miss Simpson?
I'm calling your superior officers to report this. I want both your names and shield numbers.
Help?   Help me!
That's enough! I don't care how many needles you stick in yourself or how much ginseng root you eat ... you have to sleep if you're going to recover.
I slept for seven years?
That's an order!
Jesus -- what a patient!
-- You can't  compare blood pressure readings now  with when you were in a coma. It's   not going to give a true measure  --
What's this reading?     555 over four digits --
That's crazy --
It's Martha's chicken scratches. Even she can't read 'em.
I'll tell you what it is.     It's a phone number.
 Redondo Beach Retirement Villa
I'm. sorry ... maybe I have the wrong number. I'm looking for Kevin O'Malley.
O'Malley?   There's no O'Malley here.
My name is Phyllis O'Connor. I'm with the pension board of the Los Angeles Police Department. We have a misplaced check here for Captain O'Malley ...
A check?  Well, listen... there's a big turnover here, people are dying all the time, I never know who's in what bed. Can you leave me your number?
 I'm sorry, we're not allowed to do that.
Mrs. Wade, I'll be honest with you -- I'm not from the police pension board. My name is Andrea Simpson, I'm a nurse from U.C.I. Medical Center.
You probably have no connection to this, and what I'm about to say 
will sound completely absurd to you.  My patient is a police officer named Mason Storm. He's in trouble and needs desperately to contact his friend, Captain O'Malley. If you have any idea how to contact Captain O'Malley, please help me.
As I've said, Miss Simpson, I've already asked everybody in the home. There is no O'Malley here. But it's possible O'Malley could be a relative of somebody living here. Sunday is family day. Why don't you leave your phone number and I'll contact you if I learn anything.
I can't do that.
Can I phone you?
 Of course, my dear.
 This is my number, Mrs. O'Malley.
 You mean Mrs. Wade. O'Malley is the person you're looking for.
Yes ... you're right.    I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to interrupt. I, ah, well, I was just passing by and ...
 Thanks.
Please.
I'm sorry -- (wracked with emotion) Sorry. I -- 
 Why am I still in this fucking cage?! What's wrong with my body? Why won't it heal faster?!!
Mason, please (wants to ease his pain) I love you.
Don't say that!
Why not?!
Because I can't love you! Don't you see? It's seven years to anyone else. But it's only days for me.
How can I be with you ... how can I want you and take you, when --
You seduced me. You came in here, looking that way, knowing just what the hell you were doing --
 Yeah, I knew. What of it? I wanted you --
You have no right to want me!
Then who does?!     I've risked my life for you --
Who asked you to? Not me!
You haven't stopped me!
Then don't risk it! Don't do shit for me! I don't need you!
 Pick up, Martha ... Pick up.
Get a hold of yourself, Andy.
 You're really beautiful.
 Martha! Martha, it's me --
 You looking for Martha Coe?
Yes... yes --
You haven't seen the news?  She's dead. They shot her in the back... over in Westwood.
 You look like the woman's picture on T.V... the one whose house they shot her at --
 Mount up, boys. Two to one she leads us right to our boy Storm.
That's grand theft, auto.
 O'Malley.
-- It's Sonny, all right. Believe how big he got? He can throw a football forty yards --
He made it to my house, the night you got shot. I hid him, played it out like he was dead -- even staged a funeral, along with Felicia's and yours. They bought it. Everyone believed he was dead.
Where is he now? Is he safe?
Trinity School in Ventura. Under my mother's maiden name, Wade. No one has any idea he's your son.
 Then that was your mother.   The one Andy found.
Your nurse friend? Yeah. She left your number, I traced you to here.
O'Mal ... I can never thank you.
Just seeing your ugly ass alive, that's enough for me.  You wouldn't happen to have a beer around this joint --
I'd give my left arm to see Sonny, just for two minutes. But we can't risk it -- not yet. Not till I get Calabrese.
Calabrese? Calabrese's dead.
Someone blew the shit out of his Cadillac -- six months after you 'died.'
 He did his thing -- then they waxed him.
The two guys at the pier. They ordered the hit on me too.  And I've got 'em on film. Still in the camera, right where I left it.
-- That night in the hospital, I found the audiotape ... in your vest. I must've listened to it a thousand times -- looking for little quirks in the voices, phrases they repeat ...
Where is the tape?
I turned it in for evidence.
Don't worry, I made a duve. I'll get it for you. Meanwhile maybe this'll cheer you up.
What happened, O'Mal?    To you?
I was on the case, trying to find who pulled the trigger on you. But it was like swimming through shit. People kept telling me to back off. Then one morning, the phone rings. Immaculate Heart Emergency: someone ran my mother off the road, her back's broken, she's paralyzed.
 I'm sorry, O'Mal.
That night there's a note in my locker -- letting me know it's not an accident.
You know me, Storm. I never would've backed off. But there was Sonny to worry about too. What if they found him? What if they found you?
You did the right thing, O'Mal.
We'll get 'em, buddy. Every fucking one of them.
Get Sonny out of that school, O'Mal. Right now. With me alive and making a stink, whoever's on that film is going to be looking harder than ever for Sonny -- just to get to me. Get him someplace safe ... three thousand miles away if you have to.
Consider it done.
I'm going straight to get that film. When you've got Sonny safe, bring me the audiotape. We'll put 'em together and get 'em to Esposito for the T.V. news. That should be quite a show.
You got it, partner. (starts to back out) You can always reach me through my mother. (pauses, shifting to forward) What about that nurse? She still in this?
Gone.  For the best. For her best.
Thanks for the brew!
 I'm gonna take you to the bank, Senator Trent. The blood bank.
Martha's dead.
I won't leave you. Not ever again.
I won't let you.
O'Malley was here.
Here?   How did you find him?
You found him. The old lady was his mother.  And Andy ... my son's alive.
I know this fuck. He's a cop!
 Holland! The other man on the dock --
Are you crazy?!     Get us outa here --
Shit!
What the hell are you doing?!
We just made the top of the chart, Andy. Every cop in the city thinks we shot our way out of a legitimate bust --
There are no cops here!
Only 'cause they're too stupid. (cocks the slide, ready to go) We need that film and we don't need any bullshit --
Goddamit ... for once, do something the non-violent way!
-- Gee, my husband and I aren't really thinking about selling. In fact, we're adding a nursery --
Oh, that's the best time for us to see it! Then when you do come to sell, our office will know the upgrades you've made and we can market your home more effectively.
Hell, come on in. Everyone else does.
New wall ... fucking yuppies!
 Just checking for termites He tucks the camera case under his arm -- takes Andy by the elbow.
 Better have this place fumigated -- quick.
 O'Malley left his mother's place three hours ago -- with the tape. He should be at the school by now, but she hasn't heard back from him.
 Fuck the tape. We gotta get this film to Esposito or I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.
 Mrs. O'Malley. Sorry ... listen. We're outside the Century Plaza now ... the hotel. Right, right. The one in Century City. Okay, listen closely ... (makes this very clear) Tell O'Mal to leave a message for us at the hotel desk. Leave it for Andy ... Andrea Smith. We're not gonna check in, it's too dangerous -- but the desk will hold the message if you tell them we're coming in this afternoon. Got it? Great. You're a champ, Mrs. '0.'
You're gonna call Esposito.   But not from this phone.
Hey, hermano!     You want this Jeep?
How hot is it?
Fuckin' smoking.
We got it, my man.
 Esposito won't be here yet. He said three-thirty.
He'll be there.
Try O'Malley one more time.  If you hear any lions roaring, haul ass.
Don't worry.   I'm a big boy.
Someone wants to talk to you, Storm.
What a day, huh? Beautiful! (squints up at Storm, offers bag of nuts) Want some nuts?
I haven't got the film on me.
 I didn't think you would. (clears space beside him) Sit down. Take a load off.
You do have the film somewhere, I assume?
Developed yet?
Still in the camera.
Good. Very good. That way I know you haven't duplicated it.
You know, Trent ... I could rip your fucking throat out before that sonofabitch over there could find the spit to sneeze.
Oh, I'm sure you could, Storm. (keeps munching peanuts) But not before one of those other gentlemen, across the way, could put a fifty-caliber slug through your brainpan.
Very well placed, Trent. But did you know that human reaction time -- even the fastest -- is between half and three-quarters of second? And in that time, I could easily --
You could kill me now, Storm -- but you'll die two seconds later.
You think I care, motherfucker? Just so I get you -- one way or the other.
Maybe you care about this, asshole.
Reach into my jacket pocket. (when Storm hesitates) Reach in!
I want that film and the tape. I'll give you three hours.
 Just tell me one thing. Who pulled the trigger on me and my wife?
 Hate poisons people. Let go of it.
 I missed your kid seven years ago. But I won't miss tonight.
Bring that film, Mr. Storm.    Three hours.
 It's fun, huh, kid? Kinda like a field trip.
I'm remembering both of you.    And when my dad gets here --
He's gonna have a long trip, kid -- starting from Forest Lawn.
By the time this night's over, your old man'll have a use for that phony grave of his.
Yeah... yeah -- we'll be right down.
 We'll come back with your French fries. (padlocks the door) Don't leave home without us.
Malley!
It's okay, sport. It's okay... it's okay --
Is that a steering wheel -- or a Winchell's donut?
 I need to check any messages for a Miss Andrea Smith.
I'm sorry. I see no slot for that name --
She hasn't checked in yet. But she's due here. Someone might have left a message for her.
Here it is. There's just one message.
You can put this back now.  You never saw me. (indicates other cops) You never saw these guys.
Sonny got away! He's with O'Malley! O'Malley's gat the tape -- they're heading for Union Station.
Get the goddam cars!
Be careful you don't get any    of that guck on your sweater ...    let me comb your hair before your    old man gets here, it's stinking    up in the back.
Quit it, will you ...    you're making me more nervous than    I am already. My father's going to    be more interested in seeing    the real me.
I think I'm more nervous than you are, kid. We got out of my mother' place about two shakes ahead of the landlord ... know what I mean?
My dad'll get 'em. You guys'll nail them all. (beat, thoughtful; then) You think he's gonna like me?
Does a bear dump in the woods? Are you kidding -- he's gonna love you.
Let me see the tickets. Did you get us one of those sleeping cars? What time is he getting here anyway?
Soon...
 Hey, O'Malley! Long time no see.  Taking a trip somewhere?
 Make sure your father gets this ...  Yeah. Me and my son are visiting my mother in New Mexico.
Your son, huh? That's funny.     He doesn't look much like you --  Does he, Turner?
Looks a lot like Mason Storm.
Enough of this fucking around.    We want the tape.
Sonny -- run!
 Go!   Sonny -- get outta here!
Get the kid!     He's under the cars!
Give us the tape, kid -- and we'll take you home.
Fuck you, Jack!
 You don't deserve to wear your badge. with his last failing strength, O'Malley raises the tire iron. Nolan PUMPS him once, square in the chest, killing him.
Where to?
That's a good question.   Out of here for sure.
 Where are we going? Who are you?
It's a long story. You got a few minutes?
 What do we have to do, Holland drive a fucking stake through his heart?
I'll settle for a bullet.
You had him point-blank seven years ago, and he's still walking!
He won't be for long. Not with his picture on every T.V. in --
Fuck his picture! Get off your asses -- (waves them to get out of here) Start earning your money!
How's the action, boys?   Mind if I play?
I know what you guys are thinking. You're thinking I couldn't play with this gun in my hand. Right?
Well?   Somebody hand me a cue.
That's for my wife. Fuck you and die.
I want Dunne and the others here. That goddamn Storm is nuts enough to come after me --
He's nuts -- but not that nuts.
Sonofabitch.
How does it feel to know you're about to die?
I'll give you more time than you and Trent gave my wife.
Vernon, oh, Verrrrrnon, where are you?
 Let's see ... where could that bad boy be?
You know, Trent, I want to kill you so bad I can barely contain myself. But I keep thinking that death is far too merciful a fate for you, and that a nice petite white-bread boy like you in a federal penitentiary ...  -- let me put it this way -- I doubt whether you could remain anal retentive for very long. Yeah... I think that's best for you --
Murder is a serious business, my friend. And an expensive one.
I'm up to here with caution! This lives on alfalfa sprouts and bean curd, he ain't gonna die of natural cause.
All I'm counseling is a little patience. The man is public. He's in the paper every day.
Yeah? Well, the next time I read about him, it better be in the obituaries.
Hey ... Seven year Storm!  I told you you'd be famous.
 Hey!   Why'd you do that?
 Knock, knock.
Who's there?
Boo.
Boo who?
You don't have to cry about it.  I love you both.
