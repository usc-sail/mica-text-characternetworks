I could've gotten more, but your moms was holding me up.
Oooh.   That's jacked up.
How many you get?

Ain't Shelley that chick from your math class?! Denise... What? These are your damn study group numbers! Why you frontin'?!
I don't see you with no list of numbers.
I'm not the one looking for a girlfriend, man. You the one still a virgin!
Shut up!
Trying to help your ass. I'm sayin', whatchu waitin' for?!
Kickin' that same `ol quiet shit since 6th grade. I don't need to press, I gets plenty. Shit.
Wah-wah.

Oh shit!! Yeah, you got me with that one.
Quit playing.
Your stop.
Huh?
Your stop-- you're getting off here, right?
Nah, I'll roll with you a few more stops.
Why you gon' walk all the way back down for? That's stupid.
Make sure you get home okay.
You ain't big, nigga. Trying to protect somebody. Hurry up, man, get off!
 That's alright man--next stop. Next stop!
You ain't gotta push me, why're you beastin'?
I'm not beastin'.
You got a problem. Call me.
I'ma call you.
You late.
 Be quiet.
Where you been this late?
 Movies.
Movie ended at midnight.
 Shhh. Shut up.
 Don't push me.
 Go to bed.
I know what stays open past midnight.
Shut up!
Good night Lee!
Lee? Lee?!
Nice to know you still live here.
What're you doing home so late, anyway?
Lost track of time.
You know what time your curfew is. Where were you?
Movies.
The show ended at midnight. And your curfew is twelve thirty.
I lost track of time.
At least you were cute. Where'd you get that shirt? `Princess'. I like that.
It's old.
Compliments your figure. I saw something just like it on sale, maybe we could go shopping--
Goodnight.
I really don't care for that young lady you run around with anyway.
Yeah, okay!
And tie your head up.
It's your head. And you really should wash your face, too.
I don't have on make-up.
Wash your face anyway.
Mom. I'm seventeen years old, please don't talk to me like--
Watch your tone.  Well, it's your skin.
Did you brush your teeth?
Lee?
Lee?
Yes, mom.
As promised, I will be grading these on a curve.
But the highest grade on the test was a 98.
Hey there!
Hey!
Whaddja bring me?
Nothin' you can eat.
You shouldn't be eatin' that crap, either.
 I know.
Sooo, where's the new stuff?
Hmmm.
Did you see the one in the back?
I'll probably do it in class.
So?
So what?
What do you think?
They're okay.
Okay?
They're lovely. Of course your descriptiveness and use of alliteration is beautiful and all, you know that. But...I don't know. Is it your best? No.
I thought it was good.
It's good. Not great.
I believe you can go deeper.
Oh, so your log is all up to date?
No I--
And you've checked the round for any calls?
Well I --
Do you even know which doctors are on the floor?
No ma'am I--
Then I suggest you get busy.
Hey girl! Mind if I sit here?
No, not at all. Help yourself.
Whatchu got there? You been shopping?
Oh, no. Just some yogurt. Some vanilla yogurt.
No I meant in the bag. What do you have in the shopping bag--the big red thing?
Oh I'm...I don't know where my mind is...Yeah, this is just uh--well let me get your opinion.
Oh that's nice.
Yeah see isn't this cute?
Umm-hmm. That's for your daughter?
Yeah, this is for Alike.
The youngest one.
No she's the oldest one.
Oh, the other one. Okay.
What, you think it's too young?
No, no. For whatever reason the youngest one popped in my mind first. But I think it should be fine. It's really cute.
Thank you.
It'll compliment her figure.
Now see that's what I thought... But Lee doesn't like anything I pick out for her anymore.
Girl, please. My oldest, 17 going on 27 mind you, banned me from buying her any more clothes. We have two completely different tastes. I just give her gift cards now and trust me, we're both happier for it. Is it her birthday?
No, no. I just wanted to get her something nice. You know.
Well, no we--
None of yo' damn business!!
Let me know how it goes.
Oh I will. I'll call you when--
Is that her?!
I don't see why we can't just watch TV like usual.
Quit it!
Shut up.
You don't tell me what to do!
Girls.
I'm expecting a call.
This is your father's night off.
So straighten up.
Homecoming got moved this year. It's gonna be in September instead of October.
Oh really?
Yeah. Which means I'll be able to go to Autumn Ball and the Homecoming Dance.
Who are you going with?
I don't know. Maybe Derek. If he asks me. Maybe Parrish. I haven't decided yet. But for homecoming, I definitely want to go with Craig.
Oooh, I see. Lee, who are you going with?
Umm. I'm not going.
Not going? This is your junior year. How can you not go?
Leave her alone Audrey, if doesn't want to go, she doesn't have to go.
But it's her junior year, she's not gonna have any memories.
I don't like all those boys buzzing around my daughters anyway.
Nobody buzzes around Alike.
That's right and it better stay that way. Matter of fact, I don't know if I'ma let you go.
Daaa-aad?!
How much we paid him last time?
Six twenty-five.
So that makes--we owe another two seventy-five for the rest of the month.
Electric?
Half.
Phone?
Let it ride.
Gas?
How much?
Eighty-five.
Half. No let it ride.
I can get some more hours--
No. You know what you need to do.
Nah Candy, I can't just dip out on you like that--
I was doing just fine before you moved in, remember? I can handle it.
You working was only supposed to be temporary. Mom would've wanted--
Who?! Man, don't even--
She would've--
Stop.
I'll get the money orders in the morning.
I'll look into it alright?
The next test is coming up soon!
I said I'll look into it!
It was like seven of us--Me, Khalil, Misha, Tamara....
Heeeell no--Fat Tamara.
Oh I was about to say, Tamara Marks is a ughh--I can't stand her.
Anyway, it was all of us and oh Laura, you know that girl from the restaurant? She was there with one of her friends.
That gay chick? Ya'll be hanging like that?
Yeah, well it's a couple of them. She's mad cool though, so sometime she come out with us every now and then, anyway--
Man, y'all be doin' it on it weekends, let me find out!
But anyway--
Some of them AG's are kinda cute-- I'm not saying I would, but I would holla.
Isn't that one of them over there? What's her name? Amika?--Alisha?
Alike.
Yeah, Alike--she's cute too.
Look, I'm not gay--but if I was gay I might talk to her.
She's in the middle anyway.
Yeah, but if she was just a little more harder--
`Sup ladies?
Oooh--let me find out, Mika. You act like you bi- or something.
I like girls but I love boys.
Watch out, it's slippery.
So what do you think?
I already told you what I think.
But you know her, right?
I said I know of her, I don't know her know her.
I'm saying, you know her friend, right? You gonna introduce us?
Just put those on that stack right there. Yeah, thank you.
You listening?
I'm listening--all I'm saying is-- pass me that milkshake mix right there.
All I'm saying is that I don't think you should put yourself out there like that. Especially if you don't even know if she likes you like that.
She does.
How do you know she does?
I just know she does.
Hmmph. We'll see.
What're you doing?
I thought I felt a drop of pig shit.
Shut up.
All I know is I been trying to get you to holla at girls in the club for the longest.
I don't want to holla at girls in the club.
Obviously. Why you pressed about this chick?
I wanted to ask you about something else too.
Oh God, what now?
I need you to get something for me.
What?!
What?!
Just for my image.
WHAAAAAT???!! You trying to strap!!?? Whaaatt?!! Oh my God, what are you going through...
Please.
What difference you think having a bulge in your pants gon' make?
Pleeeeease. By next Friday.
Next Friday?! Okay-- Whatever. Oh my God I can't believe you ! Alright. Yeah. She better be cute for all of this...
I think it looks natural.
I'm serious, I mean it doesn't look that bad.
I can't believe you.
What?!
Laura, this doesn't look right. I'ma look stupid.
Well, first of all-- I don't think its supposed to be on top of your underwear like that.
I'm not putting this thing next to my skin, it pinches already.
It's supposed to fit like that.
They didn't have any brown?
I didn't have time for all of that. The brown ones were too big, anyway.
Ugh! You gotta take it back.
I can't take it back.
Here's the receipt!
Unh-unh. I'm not going back in there. One time was embarrassing enough.
You grown!
Still what if somebody would see me in there? I'm not going back, that's it.
Then where's my change?
Lee, where'd you put my make-up case...AHHH I'M GON' TELL. OOH LEE, I'MA TELL DADDY!
Eeew get that thing, off a me! Get it off me it's nasty! I'm tellin'!

Eeew.    Get it offa me!

OK, look I'm offa you.     Just be quiet and calm down.
I'm tellin' that you got that thing.
You can't tell.
I'm telling.
Shut up.
It looks nasty.
 See, I told you so.
Where's my make up case?    I know you got it.
I just borrowed it.
Give it back.
Promise you won't tell.
Give it back.
LEE, STOP IT EEEW!!! I just got that one.
Shhh!!
Don't touch it with that... eeww that's so nasty. C'mon Lee give it back.
Then promise you won't tell.
Promise...
Ughh, I hate you.
OK, OK I won't tell.   Daag!
I'm still tellin'
Tellin' what?
Noth--                           She took my makeup again.
Lee...  Oh. Hello Laura, I didn't see you standing there.
Hi Mrs. Freeman.
How's your mother?
I haven't spoken to her in awhile. She's fine.
Well I hope so. And I'm so glad to hear your sisters finally getting back on her feet. Wasn't she--
She's good.
Mom?!
I think we'll just leave this open. Let some air circulate in here.
I was just about to leave, anyway. So...
Just try it.
Will you chill? You just gotta get used to it.
Owwww!
Sit still, people gon' think you got something.
This joint hurts, man. I'ma go take it off.
You not gon' take it off.
I'm gonna take it off.
Where you gonna take it off at?
In the bathroom.
Then where you gon' put it? You gonna walk around the club with a dick in your hand? Chill. I knew we shouldn't have done this. You blowin' me right now.
Then I'm out.
Nah, you're `bout to stay and go through this. You're the one who wanted to meet her, not me.
Then you come on, too. Hurry up--
You alright?
Yeah, no, yeah it's just--there's a spring in the cushion or something.
You wanna switch seats?
No, I'm good.
And you don't wanna dance?
Hey ya'll we're about to go dance!
No, no not really. I'm not really feeling the music.
Well you don't mind right? I mean you don't mind if I go dance with somebody else?
No, do your thing.
If you change your mind--
No, no it's cool.
I hope it was worth it.
Mom I lost--
Save it.
It won't happen--
Oh I know it won't.
Turn that mess off!!
Sharonda?! Sharonda are you ready?! Stop lollygagging!
I'm coming!
Lee are you ready?! Lee?!
I said off. Thought you were ready?
I am ready.
You're not going to church looking like that. Where's the blouse I bought you?
What's wrong with this?
Hey there, you're home early--well actually late. I thought you would have called--
Dad--
Do what your mom says.
Are you hungry? Let me heat it up for you.
I'll heat it up on the stove for you. Tastes better.
Dad--
Lee!
Leave me out of it.
Go get changed.
Dad, what's wrong with this outfit?
Nothing.
See?
I'm not gonna argue with you.
Do what she says.
Dad--
 Umgowa!
And put on a skirt!
Hey Dad!
Too much lipstick.
It's lipgloss.
Okay, okay.
Gimmie kiss.
Did you talk to her?
Get me a beer, please. Sharonda's fine.
I'm talking about Lee.
Alike. And I don't see that there's a problem.
I'm tired of this tomboy thing she's got going on. And Laura. You said you were going to handle it.
Umm-hmm.
She needs a male point of view.
I said okay, dammit! Now can I please have a beer please?
It's Sunday morning.
It goes with the spaghetti.
Do you have to work tonight?
To put food on the table and clothes on our backs, no. To go out to restaurants and keep designer sneakers in the closet, yes.
Are you forever gonna be mad?
Are you forever going to be happy?  You made that decision a long time ago.
We both made sacrifices.
You look beautiful, baby.
Tuck your blouse in.
This isn't me.
Tuck your blouse in.
Leave it out.
I think it's fine out. What's the deal with you and Laura?
What deal?
Comin' in late...
Dad, I hardly ever--
Why don't you give that a break for a little while?
Dad, come on...
 You heard him! 
Coming!
You coming with us?
Nope. Sleep.
We could go to a later service. The one o'clock--
I said NO!!
I'm ready.
Alike, you look beautiful. Everybody looks beautiful, okay?
Lee! Lee! Here's someone I want you to meet.
Huh?
Oh. Hey.
Get down out the car and come speak.
What's wrong with you?
Alright, Mom.
You'll have to excuse her, she's been feeling rude lately.
Oh don't worry, Audrey, I understand how it is. Hormones. It's just a phase.
Alike, this is Mrs. Singletary, one of my co-workers and her daughter, Bina. Sylvia, Bina, this is my daughter Alike, we call her "Lee" for short.
Hi.
Hello.
Nice to meet you.
Hi.
And this is my youngest daughter, Sharonda.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi there, nice to meet you.
Lee, Bina goes to the same school as you.
Cool.
Yeah, I think I've seen you around. Mrs. Alvarado's class right? AP English?
Yup.
So. Now that we're all acquainted, don't be a stranger.
Oh no, we won't.
Bina I think you and Lee may even go to school the same way. Don't you live off of St. James Place?
There is something to be said for safety in numbers.
Well, we need to be pushing off -- I'll call you about those VBS workbooks.
Alrighty, I'll be around. Take care.
You're funny.
I don't know what your problem is.
Can somebody put in this CD please?
I don't know what you think is going to change.
I know God doesn't make mistakes. I know that much.
You may not like Bina, but you're certainly gonna be spending much less time with that Laura person, I guarantee you that much.
Moooom, can you--
Be quiet. Nobody's putting in anything. I'm gonna listen to what I want to listen to for a change.
Look, I don't like lying to my mother, that's all.
Then don't, she doesn't have to know.
She does.    She asks me everyday.
So tell her yeah.
No, I'm sick of lying to cover for you.
So don't.
Look Alike, Lee. Whatever it is you wanna be called. I'm not trying to hang out with you, either, but I'm not about to take an L for it. So stop dodging me, let's just go to school together and be done with it. We don't have to see each other any other time than that.
Whatever, my mother asks me again, I'm telling her. Then she can tell your mother, then it's whatever for you.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey look, I'm sorry.
Yeah, you sorry your mom is gonna bug out.
No for real, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be that way. It's just... OK, I am concerned that my, my mom will find out, but...
But?
It's not like that. It's just-- she's just. If you knew her, you'd understand. She's like, I don't know.
So what's your favorite class?
You don't have to make small talk. Let's just walk.
I said I'm sorry. It's not you, it's just that my mom is like, she's like...
Overprotective?
Yeah.
I can tell. I've seen--I mean, a lot of people's parents are like that.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah. But probably not like mine. But anyway...
Anyway, like I said, we don't have to talk. Just walk.
Hi! This is Lee, I'm not able to answer my phone right now--
How's it comin'?
It's good.
Oh my God!!
That's just embarrassing!
You ain't got no range, either.
Yeah but at least I hit the backboard. Damn.
Brick!!
What's the score?
One up.
One?
Yup!
One? Nah, I definitely have like three. At least three.
It's on again... Check it out Free. Channel 5 and Channel 2.
Look who's big time.
Brother was looking clean though. Looked just like, look like...uh-- Danny Glover!
Been more of that since they opened up that new club `cross the way.
 Excuse me Miss??!! Miiiiissss??!!
Certain Friday nights they got, you know special parties going on.
Or should I say Sir??!! Siiiir??!! Hello?!!
Chill out, Sock.
Hey, my man! You hear me talkin' to you?!
Hey!!
Mind your business.
And a pack of Kools.
Say, I been trying to get your attention. Do you go by Sir or Miss?
That'll be all ma'am?
Yeah.
Look I just had a simple question I wanted to ask. See, I just want to know how does pussy taste?
You know, I just wanna know if you go with women for the taste, or is it just you're too big, black, and ugly so don't no man want you?
$65.07 ma'am.
I can't lie, pussy do taste good.
Oh yeah?
Maybe you should try it yourself sometime. Or better yet--
--ask yo' wife how she likes me!
Fuckin' Bulldagger! He-She! Dyke!
Ask your wife!
She told you.
She ain't tell me shit! I don't know what the fuck y'all niggas are laughing for!
Awww shut up. Your big mouth got you in trouble as usual.
Thought you was my friend, Mack. But I guess I ain't expect you to defend me Free, the way your daughter is--
Say what?!
He don't mean nothin'! He don't know what he's talking about!
He ain't moved outside a two-mile radius of where he crawled out his mammy's pussy. He don't know shit.
 I been to Poughkeepsie!
Carry your Poughkeepsie ass on out of my store!
Fuck y'all!
I should arrest your ass.
Man, fuck y'all!!
Free, don't pay him no mind. Just talkin' trash.
Damn, this is your color. So what's the deal incog-negro?
Mom has me hemmed up.
Your phone ain't broke. You coulda called a nigga. Put this on.
My bad. She's making me hang out with this chick from church. It's crazy.
Makin' you?! You a grown-ass woman, bruh!
Try these with it. So I guess the piers is out for Saturday, huh?
I don't even know if that's me anymore.
Yeah, that's hot, yo. You should rock that.
I was gonna see if you wanna do something different?
Different like what?
I don't know--maybe like a open mic or something.
Open mic? Nah, man. It's plenty chicks at the piers, you just gotta be more confident.
You can rock this. I haven't even worn it yet. But I understand if you got better things to do.
Nah, I'm down.
You sure? I don't want you getting hemmed up.
Nah seriously, I'm down for whatever.
Real?
Promise.
That's what's up! I'ma take the whole day off. It's gonna be tight watch... we gon' do it up!
You should wear your hair down sometimes.
Your father likes it up.
It looks nice down.
Maybe. Anyway give this back to Bina's mom when you go over tomorrow night.
Saturday night?!
We talked about this.
No we didn't.
Lee--
I had plans for this weekend.
Well, you don't have to go to Bina's on Saturday night, you can always stay home with me.
Oh my God!
You like Destiny's Child?
Uhh-uhh.
Jay-Z?
Nope.
Fifty?
No, I don't really like any of that commercial bullshit.
Oh. Who do you like?
Shit!
Just more underground stuff. None of that crap they play on the radio.
Like who?
People you probably haven't heard of. Conscious stuff.
Like who?
Roots. Black Star. Asheru and Blue Black. Pharcyde.
Pharcyde? I heard of Pharcyde.
Ah--for real?
Yep. Tribe? J-Rawls? Bahamadia?
Uh-oh, whatchu know about Bahamadia? Let me find out....
I'm not as generic as you think.
Hello? Hi Audrey. Yes. Yeah she's here. I understand--
Alright, how about Rock?
It's cool.
Whatchu know about Santogold? Since you all underground and stuff.
She's tight.
Tamar-kali?
I haven't heard of her, I heard of Res.
Oh no this is way better, you gotta check her out.
"Her hair is short. Her legs are brown. Her lips are full. Her head hangs down."
Wow.
He-llooo.
Hello Mrs. Freeman. Is Lee home please?
She's out with her friend right now, Laura. You take care.
Oh. Umm do you know when she'll be back?
No, I believe she's out for the evening.
Oh, because we had umm... alright then... Thank you.
Goodnight.
"Twist a virgin `round your dirty little finger! 
Yo, this shit is hot!
Told you. Don't you have to go? I'll cover. It's cool.
Nah, I wanna stay.
Leave a message and I'll call you back. BEEP.
Where you at? Hit me up when you get here.
Mrs. Alvarado was trying to get me to check out this one place.
Oh hell, no. That's for old people-- I'll write down some places you should check out. Maybe you could read some of my stuff, too.
Definitely.

Comments? Critiques? Julie, tell me what you think.
I liked your story, though. It was tight.
Yeah? Which one? The one about the--
The one about karma, how things come back to you. That one, I thought it was tight.
For real? Thanks. I wasn't gonna say anything, but I liked yours too.
Why?
Why did I like it or why wasn't I gonna say anything?
Why did you like it?
I don't know. I guess because it felt honest.
Oh.
Didn't you have on a different shirt earlier?
What?
Nothin'.
No, what'd you say?
Nothin'.
Yeah, I had on a different shirt.
Oh... Well, that's cool.
So why weren't you gonna say anything about it?
About your shirt?
About the poem.
Cause you're moody.
Moody?
And quiet.
Man, I'm not moody.
Yeah, right.
What?
This is me.
It's not so bad when there's some conversation, huh?
You wanna come up?
Who gave you this?
What the bear? My dad.
No, this.
Oh that. Girl, my stupid ex- boyfriend gave me that.
Oh. Cute.
Not really. I mean I guess it was at the time.
Anyway, this is the other artist I was telling you about. Her stuff is like, bouncier.
This is straight. You'll burn me a copy?
Yeah, I have a bunch of other stuff, too.  So who do you hang out with? I don't really see you with anybody.
I didn't mean it like that. I was just asking because I was curious. I don't really like anybody that goes there either.
My friend Laura used to go there. Not now, but she's going back.
Oh because, I was just gonna say-- I'm going to this house party and you can come if you want to.
They play this kind of music.
Sure. How'm I supposed to dress?
You don't dress. You just come however. Come as you are.
Can I see?
Yeah...But that's mainly old stuff, though.
This is the one you did today?
Yeah.
Nice.
Take it.
Sorry, here.
You play too much.
Seriously, it's right here.     Just take it.
Thank you...
You're welcome...
Mmmwaahhh!
What's so private?
Nothin', just my writings...
Why'd you do that for?
Sorry---
No, I'm sorry. I just umm...I gotta go.
I thought--
Sorry.
You'll get that for me?
Wassup man.

Mind your business. Bam! That's what I thought!
 Hey Dad!
Dad?
Come on now, you know that's not what I want. That's not what I'm saying. That's not--listen to me. Are you gonna listen to me?
Mom?
Lee? Hold on.
Huh?
No, not you.  Hey, I'll talk to you later, alright? My daughter's up.
Who was that?
What you doing up?
Just wanted to talk.
Dad, the plate--don't trash the plate.
Aren't you hungry?
Ate already.
You ate at work?
No, just grabbed some take out.
Oh. Where?
Why you asking me all these goddamn questions, girl? What's wrong with you? You don't question me.
Sorry.
Hold up. I'm sorry, Alike come on back. Look-- I got patties...
Beef?
And chicken. C'mon.
Listen uh...Your momma's worried that uh...How's school? Straight A's?
Probably.
That's right. Want a sip?
I said a sip. A sip!
What's on you your mind?
Nothin'.
What if--what if...say somebody liked you right?
They like you? Or they like you, like you?
Say they like you, like you.
Uh-huh.
I mean, they haven't said anything yet. But what if... so what if the person is kinda like a friend, but you know they like you more than that?
Well, I think that's the best way to start--as friends.
But then what if...What if the person is --
What's his name? What grade is he in? 
Yeah.
Say uh--there's this new--uh women's club up there by the liquor store--have you--do you--you haven't heard anything about it, right?
Called the Kitty Litter, the Catbox, something like that?
Nah, I never even heard of it.
Good. `Cause you know that's a uh...it's a rough neighborhood. You know that right? I had a case over there. You wanna be careful--stay away from that element. Just in case it ever comes up?
I'll be careful.
Good. I know you will.
Dad, when you were on the phone earlier? It sounded like...I mean...I guess you're headed back to work, huh?
Yep. Your mama still up?
Probably.
Tell her I had to work.
Love you.
My sister gets home at six so, you gotta be gone by then.
There's some lunchmeat in there too, help yourself.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm sorry about the other day.
It's cool.
Things have been crazy. But look, I'm sorry I bugged out. It's just...I didn't know that you...I wasn't expecting that.
You still coming to the party?
I don't know--I need to try and catch up with Laura.
Oh.
But I do wanna hang out...I mean...maybe we could do both.
Cool.  You could spend the night if want to. Avoid the whole curfew thing.
Yeah...
You sure?
Yeah.
Easy, easy now. Watch your right hand side.
I am.
Don't ride the brakes though. Good.
See? I'm getting better!! Can I drive back?
I don't about that. You're shaky girl, you're shaky. Get us some chips and I'll think about it.
Hey, baby!
Hey Mr. Ferguson!
I see Alike's been running circles around you again!
Little bit, little bit. I still got it though.
We better get going.
Gone already?
I'll holler at you later.
Get in the car.
But you said I could drive--
I said get in the car!
Look...umm...you know you're daddy's girl, right?
Oh you're home?
Hey.
I must've dozed off. How long have you been in?
Hour.
Did you see the plate in there?
This is fine.
There's room over here. You can see the TV better.
This is fine.
Thank you.
Just alike.
Say what?
You and your daughter. Have you talked to Lee yet? I told you she--
I talked to Alike.
You did?
Everything's fine. Like I told you. Matter fact, she's got a boyfriend.
Boyfriend?
Just give her some space.
Space? She's hardly ever home in the first place and you're just like her, creeping in all hours of the night. Both of you. Running around like you got something to hide, like I'm the big, bad witch and what about me? I'm home by myself all the time and Sharonda's getting older and starting to go out and pretty soon--
I don't have anything to hide. Look I told you I talked to Alike and everything is fine.
Did you ask her?
No, because I didn't have to. Besides,I would know okay? If anybody would know, it would be me. I know my daughter--
Your daughter?!!
--better than anyone else and--
So now all of a sudden she's just your daughter?!
--I'm telling you she's just    Well I guess I better not fine!!                          have nothing else to say then, huh?!
That's your damn problem, you're too much of a damn worry wart.
Let's hope you're right, Detective.
Will you shut the fuck up?!
An hour? Really? I'm not your dumb damn floozy in the street. And you will not talk to me that way.
I know you're not scared.
I'm not.
Lee?
Hmm?
I hope you know it doesn't matter to me.
I know.
So whatchu you think? She's cool right?
She's hot right? I told you. It was so tight. I'm tellin' you, you shoulda been there tonight!
This one's just for me and you.
And she's smart, too. She does poetry, you should hear it. It's like, it's good, you know?
I was thinking next weekend the three of us could--
Look, I'm right here.
Oh my bad, I thought you were beside me. Anyway, I was thinking--
Look, I'm sorry for all the drama.
No, it's cool. I shoulda--
What I'm saying is, I probably overreacted.  And then...I don't know. Seeing you two together or whatever. I'm glad to see you're finally happy.
C'mon man, you know you're my best friend. Nobody's gonna --
You don't need to say anything. I just wanted to get it off my chest. I'm happy for you, that's all.
Because I love you, alright? And I'm sayin'...I'm right here.
We goin' to get something to eat?
That's what's up.
Listen, umm--
That's for later. Bina, nice to meet you.
You too. We had fun.
Byyeee!!                           Hey hold up!
I like your friends. They're cool.
I'm not sleep.
Yes you are.
Any brownies left?
Nope.
What?
Nothing.
What?
Nothing.
What're you doing? What's wrong?
This is uh... I never... I'm sorry, I'm trippin' out.
It's okay. We don't have to.
Oh.
Thought you might've stepped out or something? How've you been?
Me and Candy, you know we're doing real good.
We might even be moving to a bigger place soon. You know she's workin' at the hospital now, yeah you'd be real proud of her. She might even go back and get her RN--
How--? How's Pops? You look good. You look healthy, yeah you look real good. You know uh, we miss you and everything--
I don't wanna take too much of your time. I just stopped by--you know I uh--I'm getting my stuff together too--I uh--
So, I did it. I took the test and--
I got my GED!
But listen I--I gotta go. I gotta get to work but I'ma leave it for you to see. It was nice talking to you.
Hey.
Hey.
You up already?
It's after one o'clock, actually.
What's wrong?
Nothin's wrong, I'm just cleaning up. Don't worry about it.
Okay then, I'll help you.
No, I got it.
Look um--I just wanted to say that last night...last night was amazing...thank you for--
Last night we were just playin' around, that's all.
Look... We can slow things down... Nobody has to know that we're together.
"Together"? Whoa, no...
Huh?! I thought... Look if you don't want to call it that, that's fine, but don't act like nothing happened.
Look, I'm not gay okay? This isn't me--I wasn't--I'm not ready for all this...

Amen.
I got this recipe from a magazine. Supposed to be very good. And you see I made those green beans you like. Sharonda pass the rice please.
Dad. You know where she is.
Where's Mom?
She...your mother couldn't make it.
Remember our old place? Waaay out in Queens? It was our first apartment, we were so proud. Had all those trees around it? In October, the whooole block would be covered with leaves. You remember.
You couldnt've been more than 2 years old. And when the wind would blow, all those leaves would come rushing down the street at us and you thought they were alive. You'd get so scared. You'd cry and you'd scream and beg for us to pick you up. I would try and tell you "they're only leaves, baby" and make you stay on the ground. But you were so afraid and you cried so hard, your mother would always pick you up. She always picked you up.
`Member how we used to--
I've been accepted into a early college program. Starts in the Spring. Berkeley.
California's a long way away--
Ten weeks writing boot camp, workshops. Then I can start summer semester.
We can talk about that. Okay?
I need you to meet with my guidance counselor. Sign the paperwork so I can graduate early.
I'm sorry, alright? I'm sorry I let her hurt you--
I need to know now if you'll sign the papers. Yes or no?
Can you forgive me?
Yes or no?
You can always come back home. Things are gonna be different, I promise you--
Dad, I'm not running. I'm choosing.
I'm not going back home.
I know.  Okay.
I better--
Tell Mom that she was right.
Right about what?
God doesn't make mistakes.
You should tell her yourself.
Mom.
Lee--Alike. How've you been?
Fine. Did Dad tell you?
He told me, yes.
How are you?
I just hope you're keeping yourself safe.
I love you, Mom.
I said I love you.
I'll be praying for you.
Heartbreak opens onto the sunrise For even breaking is opening And I am broken I am open Broken to the new light without pushing in Open to the possibilities within pushing out See the love shine in through my cracks See the light shine out through me? I am broken I am open I am Broken Open See the love-light shining through me Shining through my cracks Through the gaps My Spirit takes journey My Spirit takes flight Could not have risen otherwise And I am not Running I am Choosing Running is not a Choice From the Breaking Breaking is freeing Broken is freedom I am not broken I am free.
Yeah.  Yeah.
I got it.
Thank you.
You want me to come in with you?
Well--
You can always come back home.
I love you.
I love you too.
Let me get a hug or somethin', damn.
Call us when you get there.
You know I will.
You just better fuckin' call.
