PHIL Hello?
Oh my God please help me! I found your number in his pocket and I don't know... I don't know what to do.
Ah, what... who are you? WOMAN'S VOICE He's dead... he's dead... and I'm... just... I don't know what to do.
Hold on.   Tell me who's dead.
Parsons. Gram Parsons. We met in a bar and we had a lot to drink and he just...
Are you sure he's dead?
Yeah. He's really dead.    He just...
Listen. Call an ambulance. Where are you?
Joshua Tree. Joshua Tree Inn. Room eight.
Have you got a car? WOMAN'S VOICE Yes.
Call an ambulance. Then get out of there. Okay? Okay?
Yeah, okay. I'm goin'...
You wanna run that by me again, sir?
Okay. I'd like to see Gram Parsons.
You want to see Gram Parsons?
Yes. Alone, if possible. And would you have a gurney standing by in case I need to move him?
And you are.... his physician? Or perhaps a close relative? Phil clears his throat.
Actually, I'm his road manager.
So you're not his physician or a close relative?
No.
Mister Parsons is awaiting a post mortem. He will then be delivered to his family. I suggest you speak to them if you wish to pick through his personal effects. Sir.
Now listen here...
No, you listen here. Mister Parsons is dead and no longer appears to need a road manager. Which makes two of us.
Sheesh!
Hello buddy. How you been?
Well, I can't stand around here chatting with you all day. Things to do...
Can I help you?
Naw, I'm cool thanks.
What are you doing?
Just taking some stiff down to neurology.
We don't have a neurology department.
Urology.
Okay. Just hold your horses - I'll go check the paperwork.
I have the paperwork.
No. You have your paperwork. I need to go check my paperwork.
Hello?   Hello...
Guess who?
Martin Luther King.
Try again... Susie leans over the back of the chair and gives Phil a long slow kiss. She jumps over the couch and resumes kissing, this time more passionately. Phil tries to pull away with little success.
This.... ...isn't.... ...the best time... ...Baby....
God damn!     I'm so sorry, baby.
Yeah, out of a job again.
Would never have happened if you were there.
How do you know I wasn't?
Well, if you were, you wouldn't have let him die.
I was still 'on staff'. He was still my responsibility.
So where have you been, anyway?
How long this time? Two weeks?
Yeah, let's have this conversation again. Like you haven't just done six weeks on the road... PHIL Yeah, but I usually leave a note. And there's a paycheck involved.
Come here...
What's this?
This is a remembrance.
SHOTS:
 He was so beautiful, and he understood what my heart was feeling. I'll... 
He sang country music in a way that it had never been sung before. It was 'country rock', if you like. And it was kinda catchy. At least, the young people seemed to lap it up. It's fair to say that when Gram Parsons died, he died a star.
It's like... I can't... It was real, kinda... I... Oh, man.
And another light burns out in the desert. Gram Parsons - the standard bearer of the new country music movement - is dead, following an overdose of drugs. While many of America's young people are today in mourning, their parents will view this as another example of how today's drug culture can so easily claim a life. We'll leave you tonight with the young man's own words. Gram Parsons wrote a song called 'In My Hour of Darkness', which contains these words: 'In my hour of darkness...'
In my hour of darkness, in my time of need, Oh Lord grant me vision, Oh Lord grant me speed. Oh Lord grant me vision, Oh Lord grant me speed.
Hello.
Hi. He sits up and stretches. She leans over to kiss him, then stands and starts to tidy. He watches her. She picks up some clothing from near his chair and moves away. He drops another piece of clothing on the same spot. She says nothing and picks it up. He takes a sock off and drops it. It has stopped being a game and started being a statement. She picks the sock up and drops it in his lap. He pushes it back onto the floor. She opens her arms and everything falls to the floor. She walks out of the room and into the kitchen. He follows.
When you're here, I spend my time wondering when you're going. And when you're back, I wonder where you've been.
Phil, you give me laughs and a great time. But I'm not sure if that's enough.
You mean there's more than that?
Yes, there's more than that! There's dependable, responsible, reliable...
There's dull, boring, normal. You should hook up with someone who works in a bank. I know a guy, actually. He has fish for dinner every Friday, cleans his shoes twice a week and buys his ties in bulk because it works out cheaper that way. I'll put you in touch.
I don't mind loving a crazy bastard, Phil. But you've got to be for something and not just against everything. You have to choose something to represent.
I represent the combined forces of charm, enchantment and exuberance.
Your job is to arrange other people's lives. Maybe it's time to put a little thought into your own.
Airport, please.
Long time, no see, Barbara.
Don't try and schmooze me, Kaufman, you repellent slimeball.
The latest victim?
Meet Barbara.
It's a lot tidier than I remember.
Who the hell is she?
Gram's ex-girlfriend.
Girlfriend? Isn't he married?
Welcome to the seventies.
What do you want, Barbara?
I'm here to fulfill Gram's wishes.
That's nice. I have no idea what you're talking about.
Do you know what this is?
It's Gram's will.
To whom it may concern: I would like it to be known that it is my wish to leave Barbara Mansfield my assets and belongings in the event of my death. Signed: Ingram Cecil Parsons.
Did he write that with joined up writing or was it before he knew how?
Still the jester Kaufman, and still very unfunny.
That's not a will Barbara, and you know it. BARBARA It's better than a will, actually. It's a signed promise from Gram to leave me all his assets and belongings. And anyway, it's really none of your business what this is. I've come for the guitar.
Guitar?
Yes. Gram's guitar.   He always kept it here.
It's been a while since you were around, Barbara. 
I don't believe you, Kaufman.
Hey, well done. You found the only unbroken thing.
Why did you let her in?
It's all part of the grieving process.
How can she behave that way? Gram's not even in the ground yet.
What?
Nothing.
Don't you freak out on me.
Do me a favor and get the guitar, sweetheart.
Where are you going?
 I gotta make a call.
Afternoon.     Joshua Tree Obsequies.
 Obsequies? What the hell does that mean? I'm...
It's Latin. It means burial. Is there anything I can help with? Who am I speaking to?
Yes, you can help me as a matter of fact. I am...
Mister Parsons? I'm sorry, I'll take a look immediately.
Yeah, he was here.
New Orleans. Although he only just went, so he'll still be on his way to Los Angeles Airport. Big thrill for us here, as we're only a small facility. Nearly got Jane Mansfield in '67 when she passed through, but she got diverted to Frisco. Hello?
Hello.    Hellooo...
 Phil?
What are you doing?
These things aren't that big.
Okay.    Is that a problem?
Not really.
Well, that's good.
So what are you up to?
It's best you don't know.
I don't know what this madness is, but I'm not getting involved.
Well, that's the point.
I mean, I don't know what it is you're planning, but I'm not bailing you out again.
Right.
I'm going. PHIL Again.
This time, I'm not coming back.
I'm going to find a man who buys his ties in bulk.
 Hello? Anyone there? Then Phil is gone. Larry expels a big breath. The letterbox creaks opens again and the eye is back.
 There you are. I'm looking for Larry Osterberg.
The door is unlocked.
You Larry Osterberg?
Yes.   Welcome to my house.
Very nice.     What's that noise?
Manomanjari on the sitar by Nikhil Banerjee. (NB. Similar music may be used in this scene) Phil stares at him.
 Okay.
There's no smoking in here, I'm afraid.
Right. LARRY Who are you, please?
Oh, I'm Phil Kaufman.
And how may I help you, Phil Kaufman?
I'd like to hire your car.
Why?
Well, I need to pick someone up at the airport. LARRY Don't you know anyone with a car?
Yes, of course. It's just that I'm told your car is more suitable.
I see. In what way is my car more suitable?
Well... it's a hearse.
Yes.
And how is a hearse going to be suitable for picking someone up from the airport?
It's... a joke.
A joke?
A prank.   A surprise. LARRY Well, okay. Is it two hundred dollars worth of surprise?
No, it's more of a fifty dollar surprise.
I can lend you a bicycle. Besides, the car is booked.
Booked how?
I use it to carry equipment for a band. Phil pulls some cash out of his pocket and sorts through it.
Well, here's two hundred dollars to unbook it. Let 'em carry their own trombones.
You don't need to count it.   You could trust me.
Let's see; I've never met you in my life, you shout through my mail slot, you want to hire my hearse as a joke, and... 
That last twenty is for gas. Anyway - I haven't even seen the car yet. I'm the one who's operating on trust.
It's a hearse. What else do you need to know?
Meet Bernice.
Bernice?
Bernice is a Cadillac Superior Royale Tiara Limousine Funeral Coach. We've got a Seven gallon V8 engine offering three hundred and forty bhp at four thousand six hundred revolutions per minute. You're looking at a twenty one feet beauty with a one hundred and fifty six inch wheelbase containing a four barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor with Turbo Hydramatic transmission. Bernice weighs over six thousand pounds.
It's yellow.
Yes, it's yellow.    Bernice comes in yellow.
It's supposed to be black.
But they're all black.
That might be my point.
So how is a yellow hearse covered with flowers less of a surprise than a black hearse?
I paid you two hundred dollars for a black hearse.
 No, you paid me a hundred and eighty dollars for a hearse, and a hearse is what you've got. If you take a long, hard look at Bernice, you'll see that she's one of a kind. She's big, she's fast, she's comfortable, and she's beautiful. But she's not black.
Okay.   Where are the keys?
Why?
I gotta go. Larry looks from Phil to Bernice and back again.
Oh, no. She doesn't go anywhere without me.
Okay.   Well, let's boogie.
Someone stole her last summer.
Well, I've paid top dollar, so it's nice to see I'm getting the best...
How did you hear of Bernice and me?
You are famous throughout the greater Los Angeles area.
But you are the only guy with a hearse. Don't go getting carried away...
Pull over.
Shit.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Well... What flight are they on?
We'll wait here.
Okay. Well, what time is the flight due? PHIL Soon.
Okay.   How soon?
Why do you ask so many damn questions?
Well... I don't know.
Shouldn't we be at arrivals?
Look, will you please shut up asking me stuff?
Okay.
So how long are we going to wait?
Morning.
Morning?   What do you mean, morning?
We'll make the pick-up in the morning.
You wait till morning.   I'm going home. Larry opens the door and gets out of the car. He slams the door shut behind him and stomps off into the gloom. Phil doesn't move.
I'm only back because I don't trust you with Bernice. I don't even know you, and if you think I'm going to leave my car with you and just walk away, then you've got another thought on the way.
I'm staying right here. Where I can keep an eye on things...
Hey, lady!
Yes?
You... should be careful.
Why, thank you...
Parsons.
You've just arrived from New Orleans, mister Parsons?
Yes.
And you're flying directly back to New Orleans? On the same plane?
That is correct.
Okay. Well, enjoy your stay at Los Angeles Airport, Mister Parsons.
Thank you.
I've come to pick up my son's body.
My son died out here, you see? So I've come to bring him home. Everyone looks at Stanley.            Stanley looks at the clerk.
I'm wondering if that's enough information for you?
Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. We'll... see to it that you get every assistance on your journey, sir.
Most kind.
I'd like to see the manager, please.
Wait your turn.
I'm sorry. It's just that the man I loved died yesterday. I was forgetting my manners...
I'm sorry.     Please... go ahead.
The manager?
Can I help you?
I'm here to pick up a... coffin.
No you're not.
Yes I am.
No. You're here to pick up a casket.
Okay.   A casket.
What flight number?
It   was due out on the next flight to   New Orleans, but I'm driving it   now. The stiff doesn't like to   fly.
You're one of those funny guys, right.
Yeah, but it's my day off.
Name?
Mine or the...?
The deceased.
Parsons.
Barney - bring up Parsons.
I simply can't give you any money based on this piece of paper.
It's not a piece of paper. It's a promise from Gram to leave me all his money.
Well, I'm sorry, but it's highly likely that the estate will go to probate and be divided up accordingly, subject to a valid will existing.
Mister Parsons was a customer of ours. We can't just pass his money across to someone who says they're in the will. There are... rules.
You don't seem to understand. These are his wishes. Barbara is now sobbing, and the bank manager is becoming increasing uncomfortable. He gives her his handkerchief.
No... I do... understand, Miss Mansfield. Really I do.
Please tell me how I'm supposed to get my money.
Well I imagine that you first need to prove that mister Parsons is actually dead.
Are you saying that I'm lying? BANK MANAGER No, absolutely not. But getting a copy of the death certificate would probably be a good first step.
I'm sorry?
Stanley Parsons. P. J. GAMBRELL Gowna be a trip. Besta know yer otherwise gowna be a slow one.
Yes.   I suppose so.
Papers?
They'll be along. With this being a rush job, they said you'd understand. He passes a folded banknote across.      The clerk pockets it without a change of expression.
Well, you'd better tell them that we've got rules.
And this is the exception which proves that particular rule.
Although you don't need to tell them that.
And this... is your deceased.
Good luck with her.
Excuse me, sir.    Is that your hearse?
Hearse?
That hearse.
That hearse?
Are you okay, sir?
Okay?   Sure...
Jes sayin' 'bout the space.
Yes.
Space ma game, kinda. Partitions. Fixed. Slidin'. Demountable. Integrated.
Right.
Always say. Why have one room? When you can have two?
I see.
What's your bidness? Stanley watches the coffin and doesn't answer. A tear rolls down his face. The fat man pulls some candy out of his pocket and takes a bite.
Yup.   That's a she.
And yours is supposed to be male?
Yeah...
Well...    Gone.
Gone?    Whaddya mean, gone?
We got the wrong box.      Your box is being loaded.
Nice work.     So how do I get my box back?
You're a damn thief.
That's very hurtful.
Barney.    You receiving?
So, whatcha doin' here? LARRY Doing?    Here?
What the hell?
Excuse me.
Why?
I need to get off the plane.
Sheesh.    Only jes' got settled.
Can you speed things up? CLERK What's the hurry?
I'd like to get to the Joshua Tree while it's still light.
I thought you were taking him to New Orleans?
What? CLERK When you came in, you said you were driving the casket out to New Orleans. But just now you said you were headed for the Joshua Tree...
Joshua Tree, yeah.
Joshua Tree, Louisiana. Just outside the city.
Never heard of that.
It's small. Just another local community struggling to get by.
Use your phone?
 Hello there. We was looking for you.
Need you to sign for it again.
Looks like it's your lucky day after all.
Yeah.   I'm a real lucky guy.
I don't like the look of you.
 No. Fair enough.
Wherever there's a hippie there's a crime, even if it hasn't happened yet. That's what I always say.
Right.   Good saying.
So whatcha doing here?
We're meeting someone off a flight.
You're meeting someone off a flight?
Yes.
In a hearse?
Yes.   It's a... surprise.
Which parts the surprise: The fact that you're in a bright yellow hearse, the fact that you're dressed like something out of a horror film, or the fact that you're half a mile from the terminal and they're gonna have to walk across two runways to reach you?
Well... the first part.
The first part.
Okay, now why don't you tell me what the hell's going on?
Going on? They stare at each other. The cop shifts position and purses his lips. Larry stares at the ground looking for some kind of inspiration. Just when the silence moves beyond uncomfortable, the door of the mortuary opens and Phil clatters out with the casket.
Well, I don't care if it is first thing in the morning - but I sure need a coffee. I tell you, I've never seen so many darned bits of paper to sign! It's paperwork which is slowing this great country down. We're drowning in triplicate!
Good morning officer.
Mornin'.
I was just saying how people with work to do - people like yourself, officer - are just getting engulfed by paper. Grab the end, will you? Doesn't that just drive you plain crazy?
I guess it does.
One casket, six sheets to sign. Six! That can't be right. Does that sound right to you?
Nope.   Sure don't.
And the very last thing I want to do is to hold you up further with my chatter. Thank you for your help, officer. You have a good day, now.
Just a moment, boys.
Yessir?
Your sidekick here has just finished telling me that you're gonna pick someone up from the terminal. A surprise, he said. And here you are loading a coffin into your vehicle...
And there you have it, officer. You see the gentleman we're meeting from the plane doesn't yet know about the sad passing of his... aunt.
And you're gonna meet him off his flight with her coffin?
That's a real nice touch.
Yeah. We're doing it this way for the avoidance of doubt.
Ignition's a bit temperamental.
Right.
Have to use a screwdriver.
I see that.
Thanks for everything, officer. We'd best be off...
Yes!    We did it!!
Did what?    What did we do?
What was all that babbling about earlier?
I didn't babble. I just... have a problem with authority.
What the hell does that mean?
I don't like them and I don't know what to say to them. They make me feel uneasy.
Well of course they make you feel uneasy. They're supposed to make you feel uneasy.
You hit the wall.
I clipped it. I clipped the wall.
 There's a gap fifty yards wide! You just had to aim for the gap. How could you miss the gap?
 I was distracted. We're supposed to be picking someone up and you arrive with a coffin and I'd only just woken up and...
Hello, officer. I guess they make these hearses wider than they need to...
Are you on drugs, boy?
Uh, not at this time, no sir.
Not at this time. Okay, well let's see. You just missed a gap of fifty yards and hit a wall in broad daylight. Why was that?
Well...
Well...
Now I'm gonna...
Wait.
Fantastic.     Well done.
Oh, right.     So it's all my fault?
You... you just drove into a wall! Of course it's your fault. Jesus!
Here it comes...
Well?
Well what?
Well, what are we doing now?
He said to wait. Phil just stares at him. After a moment, Larry reverses Bernice and then drives the battered car through the gap and out of the hangar. Phil slumps back in his seat.
Nice going, hippie. Went right through the gap that time.
Well, we got it. Whoooh!!!
Jesus... What now? LARRY Get out.
What are you talking about?
C'mon, we gotta keep moving.
Get out and take your friend with you.
Look, I can see you're a bit... sensitive about this whole... casket thing.
Get out.
 Stop saying that!    I can't get out.
Why not?
I... look, it's not right to throw me out onto the street with a coffin. Larry slips the car into gear and it moves forward.
Thank God.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm driving back to the mortuary.
You can't do that.
Talk.
What talk?
Who's the stiff?
Parsons?
Parsons.
Long blond hair, blue eyes, mid- twenties?
Well... yes.
Was he in a Berkeley?
What's a Berkeley?
A luxury casket of solid mahogany, finished with a split- hinged lid, eight brass plated casket handles and an engraved inscription plate.
Parsons.
Parsons.   And he's a... musician?
Was.   He was a musician.
I'm afraid we have no official notification of death.
At this current time, the Greater Los Angeles registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths does not regard the local newspaper as an official recorder of record.
Can we please talk about this later? This is not a great place to be right now. Larry moves to get out of the car.        Phil grabs his arm.
Oh, just a minute. Now I understand... You think there's a body back there.
You think there's a body in the coffin!
I can fully understand why you'd think that. I mean, it is a coffin and all. But would I - would I really - steal a real live dead body?
You just gave the body away?
Well, it's not like this is a bank. People round here don't generally take dead bodies they're not entitled to.
Why did you give it to him?
Well, he signed for it.
Who signed for it?
John Nobody.
And where do I find this John Nobody? The clerk's attention switches to a point just above Stanley's shoulder. He points out through the window to where the hearse is parked over a hundred yards away.
There.
Empty?
Absolutely, completely, totally.
It looked pretty heavy, for an empty casket.
They are made of finest... poplar. That's very heavy wood.
Poplar? No way?   Mahogany, or oak, but not...
Look, I'm not going to argue with you now. Poplar is very well suited to the making of coffins.
Okay. So why have we got an empty coffin in the back of the car?
I'm... selling them on to a company in Palm Springs. Lots of stiffs, lots of money. And then of course, it's very environmentally sound. And... look, under the circumstances, perhaps we should renegotiate the financial arrangement between us. Larry still stares at Phil.      Stanley is almost at the car.
Fifty-fifty? That baby's worth two grand.
Don't forget now...
Notification of death.
So then Bobby transfers 'em into hardboard boxes just prior to the cremation and I drive the caskets over to a guy I know in Palm Springs who resells them.
As new?
Well I'm not sure the 'one careful owner' thing works with coffins.
The whole thing is completely immoral.
Yeah, well. I saw how outraged you were back there, when I mentioned money. Just think of it as recycling.
Look, I really need to get home.
Why?
I just... do.
Well, while I acknowledge the power of your argument, we have to be somewhere else. So just settle back and enjoy the ride. Larry slows the car down.
What now?
Gas now.
You an undertaker?
Sure am.
Ain't yer surposed to be in black?
Nope. We're special rock 'n roll undertakers. Musical morticians.
 C'mon, hippie - let's roll.
High test.
This car runs on regular.
PHIL Who says it's for the car?
Ain't fer the car?
Nope.
We could go back.
Why would we want to do that?
I wasn't expecting a long trip. I haven't packed any spare clothes. We could pick up some supplies and drive out tomorrow.
You want to go home to pick up fresh clothes? LARRY Well, yes.
And then drive back out tomorrow?
We could do that.
Just drive the car, okay?
We could just...
No. LARRY It would...
No.
I...
No.
You might need to repeat that.
Stolen? What the hell do you mean, stolen? Who steals a body?
I still don't fully understand what you do. PHIL Well, I do everything.
Everything?
This little number is for drinking money. By trade I'm a Road Manager.
Oh, one of those.   Like a well- paid gopher.
No, not like a well-paid gopher. I'm responsible for movement, maintenance and management. I'm a confidante and a companion, a partner and a patron, an ally, agent and ambassador. I'm like an executive nanny. Not a gopher.
An executive nanny, not a gopher. Thanks for clearing that up.
So where are the cops?
I called them.
There's supposed to be a funeral in New Orleans. I need to find my boy.
New Orleans? Clerk points into the distance.
The man said he's going to Joshua Tree, Louisiana.
Joshua Tree?
Where's the son of a bitch? SUSIE The son of a bitch isn't here.
Well, he's stolen Gram.
Stolen Gram?
They had some kind of weird pact. I think Phil's taken Gram out to the desert.
Why?
Some kind of voodoo thing with hot wax and dolls to stick pins in.
Don't be ridiculous.
Now that is a wise move, if you ask me.
I didn't ask you.
You'll learn about Phil Kaufman. If you stick around long enough.
And you know him? BARBARA I know he's a brainless, interfering asshole, yes.
I don't need to listen to this garbage.
That's him, isn't it?
Generally, it's best to answer the phone to discover who's calling.
Fine.
Hello baby, it's the love machine. How are ya?
Hello Barbara. How nice to hear from you again. And so soon...
Sorry Barb, gotta go.
It's been real, though.
Sonofabitch!
Okay, honey. Do you want to see who Phil Kaufman really is? Do you want to see what he's capable of? Barbara shows Susie the door.
Or maybe you already know I'm right.
You don't know shit about him.
Well why don't we find out?
So what's that about?
Sunstroke.
You've hardly left the car since we met. How can you have sunstroke?
I'm susceptible.
You're a winner, that's what you are. A winner...
Turn off here.
This isn't the way to Palm Springs. Phil winks at him.
It is if you're a coffin smuggler.
LAPSE:
Good afternoon.
Hello.
I'll take that one, please.
Fifty cents.
I was wondering... Have you seen a hearse pass this way in the last couple of hours?
What's it look like?
Well... It... It's a big car. A big yellow car. Two guys inside.
Was one of 'em sick in them bushes?
Well... I don't know.   Maybe.
Yup.   I seen it.
See, the Yin is the negative - the darkside. And the Yang represents positive - good. If you like, the first is earth and the second heaven.
The Yin Yang symbol is really evocative about the whole concept. As you travel around the circle, white or black will increase until the opposite color is almost gone. But never totally gone, right? And this cycle then repeats for the opposite color.
What seems like Yin is often supported by Yang, and vice versa. Let me give you an example: To truly know good, you must first know evil, and without good as a comparison, nothing can be evil. So by allowing Yin to flourish, you welcome Yan. By letting go of Yin, you are waiting for its return. Another example is...
It would be really nice if we could get through a couple of hours without crashing the car.
I was distracted.
Of course you were.
I don't believe it. Middle of nowhere, and... quick - stand in front of the car!
What now?
Pretend we're having a conversation.
Okay.   What about?
I don't know what about! Ever since I met you, you've talked. Yabba, yabba, yabba, every waking minute. Religion, your supersonic, supercharged car, the darkside. Now you need to talk, and you can't think of anything to say.
Whatever your damn fool religion is called, I think it works.
Well... it's more a philosophy than a religion.
Oh, well done. Good work.
Afternoon.
Afternoon, officer.    How's it going today?
Oh, it's going fine, thank you. How are things with you? PHIL Fine, fine. We just... stopped to take a look at...
...the fine view you folks have got around here.
Well, it is mighty nice around these parts. If you like desert.
 And how are things with you today, sir?
Ooooh, I'm well. Really well, actually. Thank you.
The reason I ask, is that you appear to have driven into one of our road signs.
Oh.
I'm surprised that you hadn't noticed earlier, as it does appear to be impeding your forward progress.
That's a great line... The cop turns to Phil.        He is still smiling.
Thank you.
I wonder if you gentlemen can help me?
Anything.
I'm looking for some fellows who stole a body back there at the airport. Larry wobbles with shock.
A body?     Stole a body?
A body. Rather like the one in the back of your car.
That's an empty coffin, officer.
I know it sounds strange. But these guys - there are two of them - they stole a body, loaded it into the back of an old yellow hearse painted with flowers, and they're supposed to be driving out this way.
Hearse.   Flowers.
I think he's onto us, Larry. He's just having a little fun at our expense.
In the car, please.
God damn!
He said a body. He said we stole a body.
He meant a coffin.
He didn't say 'coffin'. He said 'body'. Tell me we haven't stolen a real person.
Look, the place that I get the coffins from probably haven't filed a report yet. It'll all be sorted out within the hour. Trust me.
Oh, I'm just overflowing with trust for you, man. I feel this overwhelming feeling of... trust every time I look at you.
I'm gonna check inside that box just as soon as we're out of here.
Jesus!
What are we going to do?
Time. LARRY What?
 We're going to be arrested, that's what we're going to do. Then we'll go to court and then we'll go to jail and we'll do that for a while.
What about if I could slip out of these cuffs?
Yeah, that would be great. Then we could suspend you from a bridge in a straitjacket and set the rope on fire.
No, really. I really can slip these cuffs.
Okay.   Show me.
Do you think we should go?
Yes, I think we should go.
Oh shit.
Nicely done.
We'll be moving on, now that your sign no longer appears to be impeding our forward progress.
What the hell are you doing?
The steering lock is on.
Well...   turn it off!
I can't - he's got the keys.
So, we've escaped but we can only drive in a circle?
Yes.
Can we please go? LARRY Okay.
If you hate Phil so much, why are you chasing him across California?
He's got Gram and I need him.
Well, that's really touching. But... you've got to come to terms with the fact that he's dead.
I know he's dead, Honey. But he hasn't been officially identified, and there's no certificate of death.
I don't understand. BARBARA Let's just say I'm overly sentimental, okay?
This is all about money, isn't it?
Isn't everything?
Why do you think you deserve anything?
I was a great support to Gram before Kaufman came along and spoiled the party.
Phil's not responsible for your problems with Gram.
What do you know?
I know that he can be a pain in the ass, but when it came to Gram, Phil only ever did the right thing.
In his whole life, Phil Kaufman didn't do anything because it was the right thing to do. You can bet the ranch that wherever he is, he's having some fun.
Maybe that's what I like about him.
Sure it is, honey. That's why your bags were packed.
Have you any idea what it's like to really love someone?
You might exclusively love Phil Kaufman - but unfortunately, so does he. You're just handy to have around.
I don't have to listen to this.
Okay, you vindictive bitch. I'm going with you to Joshua Tree because my life seems to have been turned upside down and I want to know why. But you don't know me and I won't let you judge me. Do it again and I'll smash that pretty little face of yours off the fucking road. Got it?
The truth can hurt, can't it?
Well, that's it! They're going to lock me up and throw away the key.
Why would they do that?
You saw what happened. I drove over that cop's bike. That's destruction of police property, or something.
You worry too much.
Not 'til I met you...
Jesus - what the hell is that?
It's a dinosaur.
Very perceptive.   What's it doing?
 'The Polyonax Place'.  A Polyonax is probably some kind of dinosaur.
 'Dinoburgers, Reptile Steaks and Primeval Soup. Titanosaurion portions, prehistoric pricing. Liquor served'.
Pull over - let's... eat.
Let's not. The cops'll be after us and we should just get on to Palm Springs and do the thing, and then I can get home and you can... do whatever it is you do. Let's do that.
We need to stop. I'm starting to get hungry. I'm not nice hungry.
You surprise me.    I vote we keep going.
What gave you the impression this was a democracy?
You frighten him.
I do not.
Everyone else, he announces the food when he brings it. Diplodocus this and Allosaurus that. Us he just slaps it down and runs for cover.
It's probably the rabbit food.
Look, I'm a vegetarian. I have a problem with dead flesh. Okay?
I understand. Really I do. That stuff'll mess you right up every time.
I thought you were hungry.
Gotta make a call.
Hey man, where's the phone?
Out back.
Good afternoon.
Yup.
Do you have a telephone I might use?
In a minute, I do.
In a minute?
Yeah.    Phone's for customers.
I'd better order, then.
Right.
Speak to her?
Who?
Your girlfriend?      Your wife?
None of your damn business.
So you didn't?
No.
Maybe she's out.      Shopping, or something.
Yeah, that'll be it.     Shopping.
 Beer. The barman gives Stanley his beer.
Would you put a scotch in there, please?
Sure.
Bad day?
Yeaaaaah.    Yeah, a real bad day. BARMAN What happened?
My boy died out here the other day, and some punks have stolen his body.
That's worth a shot on the house.
Thanks.
 We gotta go.
Haven't finished my drink.
 Why would someone steal a body? Phil picks up the glass of water and drinks it down.
All gone.     C'mon.
Well, maybe they were souvenir hunters or something. My boy's kinda famous...
Who is he?
Gram Parsons. The Barman looks surprised.
Gram Parsons?
Gram Parsons?
Gram Parsons? Is Gram Parsons dead?
Better get going.
He said someone took Gram Parson's body. Two people...
Yeah, he was a real blabbermouth. In fact, I thought he was never gonna stop talking. Anyway, although that's real interesting, we've gotta keep to the schedule.
Schedule? What schedule?   There is no schedule...
Well, I think we should just make our delivery as soon as possible, don't you? Get our package to Palm Springs. Remember?
Package?   We've stolen that man's son.
Stolen... his son? That's outrageous! I'm appalled that you could even think we'd do such a thing.
I don't know what you take me for. I want to see in that box.
We've really got to go.
It's heavy.
Okay, then. Well, if you're satisfied, let's go.
I said it's heavy.
Heavy, yes. Well, it is made of wood. Wood is heavy. Actually.
Yeah, I remember.    Finest poplar. Larry slides the top of the casket off and looks inside. He recoils.
Jesusjesusjesus...
Gosh, they must have given us a full one. We'll have to sort that all out when we get to Palm Springs and...
Oh my God.     You stole Gram Parsons.
Well, technically, we stole Gram Parsons.
I stole a coffin, I didn't know there was a body in it.
I'd save that line for court.
What are you doing now?
I don't know! What am I doing? I mean... What-am-I-doing? Why am I here? Why am I with you? WHAT IS GOING ON?
Calm down.
I thought it was bad enough when I ran over the cop's bike, but now I'm a fucking body snatcher. PHIL Well, when you've quite finished, we should go.
Go? You go. I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going inside and I'm going to give that man his son back. I'm going to do the right thing, I'm going to follow my conscience, I'm going to...
Shit!
Son of a bitch!
You're not a very nice person, are you?
Nice? No, I suppose not.    Does it matter?
It might get you further. BARBARA I do okay. Listen, I was an orphan at fourteen and a waitress at fifteen. I do what I do because it puts food on my table, and because if I don't look after myself, no-one else will.
So what do you want from us?
I don't want anything from you. It would be a bonus to see Kaufman crash and burn, but I don't need to be there when it happens. SUSIE Why do you hate Phil so much?
Gram was the first good guy I ever hooked up with. He wasn't perfect, but it worked between us. We just seemed to fit together. But Gram was already wild, and I made him wilder. Kaufman watched over him like a hawk, and when he felt things were getting out of control, he turned Gram against me. I lost the only decent thing in my life.
Surely Phil was just looking after Gram?
Gram was an adult.   He didn't need a nursemaid.
Except that now he's dead.
Yeah. Without my help and while Kaufman was babysitting.
I don't like you much, Barbara. BARBARA That's fine. I just want what's mine and then I'm gone. Gone real fast.
Welcome back, hippie.
So why d'ya do it?
Do what?
Have a guess.
Well, I gave my word.   This is what Gram wanted.
What, cruise around the desert until he starts to smell? Were you - both bombed?
Do you have friends?
Of course I have friends.
Well, what would you do for them?
Anything, within reason.
That's what I hate about people like you. Everything's 'within reason'. There are always boundaries, provisos. You only operate with a safety net.
Tell me something - if it was the other way round, would Gram be sitting here, driving your bones out into the desert?
Well? PHIL You've missed the point. See, it doesn't matter what he would do, or what you and your tie-dyed friends think is the correct way to behave. To me, it only matters what I do. Where you have boundaries and limits and thresholds - I only have right and wrong. If I make a promise, I keep it - that's right. If I break that promise - that's wrong.
Ohmygod.
You made me do it, you bastard! I've never hit anyone in my life, but you pushed and you pushed and... you gave me no choice.
Shit. He flicks the headlight switch, but to no avail. Then, in the distance, he sees a car approaching. Stanley can be glimpsed in the driving seat as the car flashes past.
Shit.   Shitshitshit.
Yeah? LARRY Hi.
Hello.
Um. I'm one of the guys that took your son.
You'd better come in.
Where's the catch on this piece of shit?
Phil?    Phil!
What happened to your head?
A hippie hit it.   I thought you'd gone.
Hold that thought.
What the hell does that mean?
I need to know what it is you're doing.
I told you what he's doing! He's going to set fire to my Gram in some freaky ceremony with witches and black magic and... dolls.
Dolls?
Dolls to stick pins in.
What the hell are you talking about?
 I want my man back!
Enough of this shit.
They've gotta be in here.    It's fate.
Whatever happened to peace, love and understanding, hippie? STANLEY You're Kaufman?
Yup.
And you are?
I'm with him.
Hello Stanley. Remember me?     The psychotic girlfriend?
Hello Barbara. Nothing wrong with your memory.
Did you sell tickets or something? Now, you boys want to tell me why you stole my son?
Well, I didn't even know he was in the box.
I'm going to cremate him, here in the desert where he felt most at home. That's what he wanted.
The hell you are, Kaufman.
You know I can't let you do that?
I know you have to. Stanley smashes the receiver down onto the table.   Everyone jumps.
I don't have to do anything, Mister Kaufman. This is MY loss! This was MY son! How dare you try to take my grief away from me.
It's too late to claim him now.
What the hell does that mean?
It means that you were never there when it mattered to Gram. It means that you stopped being a father the moment he stopped doing your bidding. It means that you learned to care too late. That's what it means.
I don't have to justify my relationship with Gram to you.
Not to me, no.
It's true that when Gram left college, we drifted apart. 
No - he gave it his all, but in a way you could never understand. And all he ever wanted from you was approval. He wanted you to be proud of what he had achieved.
I kept everything. Every record, every article, every photo.
It's no good telling me.   You should have told him.
I loved him.
Too late...
I understand that you were his right-hand man, as well as his friend?
I was both, yes. STANLEY And that you weren't there when he died? When he needed you most?
Yes.    That's right.
So the guilt isn't all mine, then?
I guess not.
You boys took away my son. I lost him once in life, and now you're trying to take him from me again.
Can we just cut through this?
You two stole the body. Theft. Indicates Susie.
Sweetie, I'm sorry, but you seem to be in the whole thing up to your neck. Accessory.
And you are an old fool who should have called the police, but hasn't. Stupidity.
Now, let's just call the cops and get it done. The sooner we get us a death certificate and bury him, the sooner his soul will be properly laid to rest.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?
Son, you had your chance to look after Gram, and now he's dead.
 Bastard!
I only failed because I couldn't save him from himself. You failed him all his life. You never believed. I never doubted.
Okay. You tell me why I should let you take my boy. PHIL I was his road manager and his friend. We loved it out here in the desert, and we made a pact that whoever died first, the other would come down here and set them free. Gram gave his word and I gave mine.
You're a couple of druggies.   Why should I believe you?
I don't take drugs. Another 'bang' from the bathroom.   Stanley turns to Larry.
What about you? Are you a druggie?
Yes.    Yes I am.
 Nice work. Let's go.
I can't do this.      This isn't right.
Just do whatever feels right to you. PHIL God damn!
Did you call them?
No.
Are you going to call them? STANLEY Well, you haven't given me a reason not to.
There isn't a reason. If someone tried to steal my son's body, I'd stop them. For sure.
So you are prepared to go to jail?
I'm expecting to.
 Don't you worry - it's gonna happen!
Mister Parsons?
What is it, son?
I've been a junkie for over four years. I started taking heroin on June 5th 1969 at a concert in Indiana. I...
You don't need...
I've taken heroin, speed, uppers, downers, blues, morphine, methadone, mushrooms, quaaludes, acid, valium, barbiturates, straight LSD, marijuana, marijuana laced with opium, nembutal, mescalin of course, and medical methaqualone, which made me shake uncontrollably for six weeks and vomit every hour. STANLEY  That's very impressive, son.
Not my point.
Better make the point.
I started working my way through that list on June 5th 1969, and since then there hasn't been a day when I didn't at least smoke one joint.
Are we sure that this is helping?
And now I've stopped. I stopped because it seems that I had something more important to do.
He's doing this because he gave his word. I'm prepared to do this now because I think it's right. And because I believe that each body has a soul. And Gram's soul doesn't belong in a family plot surrounded by strangers. It belongs here, where he was happiest.
I'm going to go say goodbye to my son.
What's that for?
That's for failing to reinforce my expectations.
Well... I'll have to do that more often.
Did you really take all those drugs?
Of course not.
I may have got a little carried away...
C'mon, time to go...
Just checking.
Yeah, he took the body and stuffed it in the trunk of his car before escaping into the night.
Are you coming?
I reckon I am.
Thank God!
Evenin' ma'am.
Please help me, they've got my boyfriend's corpse and they're going to perform a ritual with his body.
May I see your driving license please, ma'am? BARBARA My driving license?
Please.
I've just told you that they've stolen a body and you want to see my driving license?
You people are supposed to be on the lookout for a hearse. A hearse is a big long car. You can usually tell which ones are the hearses, because they have coffins in the back. The one we're looking for is painted yellow. Does this look like a yellow hearse to you, asshole?
Is that a ticket? Are you writing me a ticket?
Yes it is, ma'am. And yes I am.
Cap Rock. This is perfect. Really peaceful...
You wanna give me a hand here? Larry walks over and grabs the other end of the casket. They walk it away from the car and lay it down. As they lower it, the coffin slips out of Phil's hands and bangs down in the sand.
Sorry, Gram.
What now?
Now we... do it.
PHIL Take the top off.
Why?
Flesh burns easier than wood.
I can't believe you just said that. I'm not taking the top off.
 Hey, man. Looking a little peaky...
Some decorum would be nice.
Right.
Do you think that's enough? Against his better judgment, Larry walks over and peers inside.
Well, I don't know.   Maybe a little more.
Enough?
I'm not having a conversation with you about how much gasoline you need to burn a body.
Only a little left.
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you when it mattered, but I was there before, and I've been there ever since. Gram, good luck to you, wherever you are.
That's my last one, man.
Jesus!    What the hell's that? BARBARA That'll be Gram Parsons, on fire.
Get in the car, ma'am.   Now.
Maybe too much fuel.
Nah, I just didn't factor in the booze inside of him. Gram always...
I think our work here is done.
Go!
How do you know it's your boyfriend?
 I recognize that birthmark on his shoulder. Look, can I make an observation?
Be my guest.
We're in the desert. It is dark. If you want to catch someone in the dark, it's best not to turn on big flashing lights and make a loud noise with a siren. TRAFFIC COP Do you want to know what I think, ma'am?
No. But I'm really, really keen to find out.
I think it was suicide. He just wanted to get away from you.
Sure is hot.
Hello, Gram.
Phil.
Do you think you should?
Not gonna hurt me now, is it?
Nice wheels. Very stylish.
They're very handy for transporting dead people around. Nothing better.
I am dead, then?
You're more than dead, Gram. You and the box are down to bones and brass.
Oh, well.    Here's mud in your eye.
What can I do for you, Gram?
You assume I want something.
Well, you're here. And seeing as I just burned you to a cinder, you shouldn't be. 
Well, okay. I just wanted to say thanks.
What for?
Doing the thing that we agreed, keeping your word, keeping them all away...
Well, that's okay, Gram.    But I don't need thanking.
You don't?
I'm just taking care of business. That's what you paid me for - that's what I do.
You shooting for a raise?
Actually, I just quit.
Well, I s'pose I should be getting along.
Goodbye, Gram. I'm glad it all worked out.
What?
I said I'm glad it all worked out.
All what worked out?
Doesn't matter. Can we go now? I'm getting sick of sand.
Well, we did it.    We saved a soul.
Singed my damn mustache, that's for sure.
Well, shall we?
Yeah.    Let's roll, hippie.
Where d'you think you might be when I'm done?
I'll be waiting.
Yeah, but where?
Get out of here.   Finish it.
