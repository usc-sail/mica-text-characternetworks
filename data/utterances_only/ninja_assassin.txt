Fuck!   Fucking-shit-fuck-fucking- fuck!
Watch it, old man!
What the fuck?     You're doing it wrong.
The needle is doing what the needle does.
What's that supposed to mean?
The irezumi does not hide the skin, the tattoo reveals the nature of the man and illuminates the four noble professions in the Book of Five Rings: the Warrior, the Artist, the Merchant, and the farmer. If there is a conflict between the needle and the skin, between the mark and the man, then perhaps the path you have chosen is not the path for which you are suited.
What did you just say, old man?
I know you didn't just disrespect me, did you? You that fucking stupid? You disrespect me, and I'll tattoo this ceiling with your fucking brains!
No disrespect.
You're lucky. I can't kill you 'til you finish this thing. Gimme that mirror! How's it looking?
Not bad. Not bad. For an old fuck.
Hey, boss. This just came for you.
What is it?
A letter.
So open it, dumb ass.
What?   What is it?
Looks like sand.
Yup. Sand. Black Sand.
No...
You know what this is?
Wanna let us in on the joke?
Years ago, I watched a man open an envelope like that one.
There were many with him and they laughed like you laugh now. Then it came from the shadows and their laughter was drowned in blood. You cannot bargain with what is coming. You cannot reason with it. Because it is not a human being. It is a demon sent straight from hell that will never stop until you are dead.
What came out of the shadows?
I cannot say the word.
What word?
That night, one of their blades struck here. I should have died, but for an accident of birth. My heart is here, on the other side.
What the fuck is that?
Looks like a Ninja, boss.
A ninja? Are you kidding me? That's the word you're afraid to say? Ninja?
Ninja-Ninja-Ninja!
You old fuck! You had me going! Ninja. That's some good shit.
Listen... you don't have to do this! Whatever you're getting paid, I'll triple it! You hear me! I'll pay you whatever you want! Just name your price!

Oh, Mr. Nan, good, you're back.
We had a heating problem, and I had to go into your apartment.
Is everything all right?
Yes, fine, it's all fixed. You keep it very dark and spare in there.
Ms. Ali, my privacy is very important to me. If you enter my apartment again without my permission, I will leave your building.
I just --
Good day.
You should have died.
On the street. Abandoned by your parents. Without a home. Without people to care for you. You should have done as most children do, and gone quietly from this world, to the next.  But, instead you fought. As you did here today. You fought. And you won.
Scars are the calligraphy of violence, Raizo. They inscribe the story of one's life.   GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT    6/4/08   10. 8    CONTINUED:                                                   8 OZUNU You survived because you are different. You are special. That is why you are here. That is why the Great Current, which flows beneath all life, carried you to me.
It's a pattern, like the currents of the ocean.
Some people see money as the root of all evil, but to me it looks like a fingerprint. Whether we're talking about 19th century Korea, or 21st century Iraq, the game is the same. If you want to understand why certain things are happening, you have to understand the flow of money.
You're excited, Mika. You know I get nervous when you're excited.
You remember the Eulmi incident?                    *
Korean queen, late eighteen-                         * hundred's. According to you, she was off'd by one of these ninja clans.
Ozunu. I think. I've been going through some of the original transcripts of the trial of Kunitomo Shigeaki. The prosecutor questioned him about a payment of 100 pounds of gold. Shigeaki answered that he didn't know what the prosecutor was talking about. The question was never brought up again. But what pinged for me was the amount- the exact same amount rumored to be paid to the Hattori Clan for the assassination of Lord Sanda.
So you start to wonder, in this ever changing world, if the cost of a man's life has remained constant.
Exactly. I figure these clans are like a thousand years old. They probably don't change a lot.
I started looking at international wire transfers, targeting banks in the regions of several high- profile assassinations and bingo-
Minister Zhang. The day before the assassination $1,555,999.90 was transferred from the bank of Shanghai. The exact market value of one hundred pounds of gold.
Highly circumstantial.                               *
I thought you might say that so I checked how often this particular bank transferred that market equivalent to a hundred pounds of gold in the last three years.
Let me guess.
Not once.
Okay you got me. This is                                * interesting.                                            *
The clans are real, Ryan. They                          * steal children and turn them into                       * assassins. They've been doing it                        * for years and nobody's doing a                          * damn thing to stop them.                                *
Look, no one's denying the historical record, Mika. But the whole idea just doesn't fit in with a modern world. It's like one of those questions on an IQ test: which of these doesn't belong in this sentence: laptops, space shuttles, nanotechnology, ninjas.
They're real Ryan. You can call them spooks, or assassins, or whatever you want if it makes you feel better, but they're out there. They're killing people and nobody is doing a damn thing to stop them.

Hi... excuse me...?  Would you mind?
...sorry?
If it's not too much trouble, could you help me with this?
What clan are you from?
I... don't understand...
You came alone. The Ozunu clan would never make such a mistake.
What is going on-
And two cokes, please.
How long have you been here? And you can't say "zwei cola bitte"?
Course I can, but you tend to hear more interesting things if people don't know you can understand what they're saying.
Do you ever stop being a cop?
Not the way I was raised. My dad always said, being a cop has nothing to do with a clock. It's a consequence of consciousness often interpreted as desire.
Desire?
For justice. And doughnuts.
So you got something else?
I think so. Same template as before. The transfer was made the day before a multiple homicide in Osaka. The police and newspapers are calling it a gangland slaying.
How do you know what the police report says? You're not still requisitioning evidence with my clearance codes, are you?
Good.
What about the bank audit?
Denied.    It was a long shot at best.
But you said you found something.
A report. A friend of mine in Moscow, tipped me to it.
It was written during the height of the Cold War by a high ranking KGB agent named Aleksei Sabatin. In it, he raises the possibility that several political assassinations were conducted by an ancient but very sophisticated network he calls the Nine Clans.

What happened to him?
Same thing that's going to happen to me, if I keep hanging around with you- booted out of the service for mental instability.
Is he still alive?    We need to find him.
Working on it.
You believe it now, don't you?
Ninjas?    Are you kidding?
Then why are you doing this?
No idea-
But I can guarantee you that it has nothing to do with the fact that you're the most attractive researcher that I've ever worked with.

 Historical evidence suggests that Ibn-Battuta's journey through the far east brought him into contact with what might be one of the oldest of the Nine Clans. He travels with a group of orphans that are being taken from a city devastated by war to the Shido of the Ozunu clan. The people of the surrounding province refer to the Shido as "The Orphanage."
Battuta describes a ceremonial dinner followed by a display of martial skill. The combatants were children neither beyond the age of ten.
His host explains that a man's life must be made meaningless compared to the life of the Clan. Own the meaning of a man's life and you own his heart.
...who are you?
Strength is the only virtue that nature respects.
Hone your body. Sharpen your mind. Become the weapon you will need to survive.
You shouldn't do that. It's against the rules. If they catch you --
Then they catch me.
They'll put you in the box.
Yes, they will.

Very good, Raizo. Very good.
Last night I'm working late and I get a visit. Guy named Zabranski. Works upstairs for Internal Affairs. Just drops by. In the neighborhood- cup a sugar- how ya doin- kinda thing. Asks what I'm working on. Oh, this and that, usual blibbity blab, I tell him. Then he smiles and says-
...Very Good.
I don't understand what is really going on, but I'm smart enough to recognize a warning when I see one.
But why?
Why? It's obvious. If your little fantasy has even slightest chance of being real, then these Nine Clans would have some pretty major juice protecting them.
What are you going to do?
We are going to tip-toe, very carefully from here on out. You understand? You don't do anything else without checking with me. Got it?
Did you find Sabatin yet?
You did.
Yeah...he's dead.
How?
Heart attack.
They killed him.
People die of heart attacks, Mika.
Was he married? Did he have a family?
God, you are relentless, aren't you.

Still in Russia?
Relocated.

 Ah, sehr gut. Bitte...please.
Shoen.
You said you read my husband's report, yes? What did you think?
I found it...illuminating. Especially the references to the Rihla. Your husband quotes passages not found in Battuta's present manuscript.
My husband journeyed all over the world researching that report, but when he was home, he never spoke about it. He said it was safer that way.
I understand the report caused some problems for him inside the KGB.
The report caused "problems" for Alexei's career the way Moses caused problems for the Pharaoh, you see? Very unpleasant. Terrible people saying terrible things.
After he retired...was asked to retire...we moved, first to Byelorussia and then here to Berlin when the wall came down. He said this will be a good place to grow old together. And it was, for a time.
What happened?
About two years ago...two? Yes, after the assassination of Zhukov, the report drew attention. After that, everything was different.
Alexei hired men to change all the locks, and put in more of them. Locks on the windows, locks on the doors, locks on the locks. He put in cameras and motion sensors and lights...everywhere, lights.
"There can be no shadows," he said. "No shadows."
I will tell you a true thing, and a hard thing. My husband was a soldier. A member of Russian intelligence. He had seen many terrible things....  He was not a man to frighten easily.

SABATIN But from that day on, when the sun went down behind the hills...in his eyes, I saw the fear a child has of the dark.  Then, one day, a man came to the door.
They talked in Alexei's study for sometime. Then the young man left.
It was unlike Alexei not to see him out. I remember being very scared. But when I opened the door, he was just sitting there. For a moment, he didn't even notice me. Then he stood up and kissed me and told me that he loved me very much. He said I should always remember that.
Do you know what they talked about?
No. Alexei never spoke about it. But two months later, he was dead.
Can I ask how he died? GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08     36.

You are the first person who has taken my husband's work seriously. It would be good to know that he did not die without cause. Come with me.
He would want you to have this.
You lied to me.

Most of this is from Sabatin. Copies of what I think are the lost chapters of the Rihle. I think it describes the original location of the Ozunu Clan but my 14th century Arabic is a little rusty.
And this?
That's how it started. I made a mistake, mixed up the case code and they sent me that.
...Christ.
Yeah. I know. I don't understand why they're fighting though. It could be a clan war.
So you requisitioned this by accident. You used my code which is why you didn't want to show me this. Which is also why they're tearing apart my office right now.

Are you coming to Berlin for business or pleasure Mr. Han
Pleasure.
Boy you're like a dog with a bone on that computer aren't you?
Excuse me? Who are you?
Agent Zabranski. Internal affairs. Need to ask you a couple of questions. You are Mika Coretti, yeah?
Forensic researcher. You work a lot with an Agent...Maslow. That right?
...A few cases.
You have something of a social relationship.
What?
You had lunch with him on the 13th and again on the 18th.
How do you know that?
Is it not true?
I...I'm not sure. We do have lunch together sometimes, usually when we're working-
Are you working on something with him right now?
No...not right now.
Has Agent Maslow seemed different lately, in any way? Has he done or said anything that struck you as unusual?
No why. Has Agent Maslow done something?
Just routine. The agency cares about its field operatives. We monitor for signs of stress, fatigue, mental exhaustion. Agent Maslow has a serious case load. That much work can wear on a man.
This is Ryan Maslow. Leave a number-
Come on...you're kidding me.
Ssssshhhhhh.   Sorry, Mika.
Fucking Christ, Ryan-
I couldn't talk earlier.   They're watching me.
Zabranski came to my office. Asking about you.
I know how Sabatin must have felt.
What happened?
I showed Jamison the materials.
What did he say?
This agency is subject to the International laws and agreements that govern the jurisdiction of our authority. If a case is marked DNP we must respect the jurisprudence of the regional government and act accordingly.
I understand that sir but-
Let me be clear, Agent Maslow. In the eyes of the law these materials do not exist. If so, than there is no case and if there is no case there is no reason for this conversation to continue. GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08   45.
He took the materials?
Come on Mika, how could he take something that didn't exist? He couldn't. Which means that I couldn't copy it either, and if I couldn't copy it than I can't be violating international laws and agreements by still having it.
What are we going to do?
Your going to go home. Pack your bags and go on holiday.
No way-
Don't fucking argue with me, Mika. I trusted you. Now you've got to trust me.
Ryan, I can't let you lose your job because of me-
I'm not talking about my job, Mika.
Take this. It's clean, no serial number. Untraceable.
I've never even fired one of these.
This is the bad end. This is the end you hold. Point, shoot, run like hell.
I'm going to try to find some help. Until then, I need you gone. Don't tell anyone where you're going, just go. Use this phone to text me when you get there, or if you have any problems.
Ryan...
I know. It's unbelievable. I've investigated, world bank officials, drug cartels, arms dealers, and I've never faced this kind of heat. For ninjas. Fucking unbelievable!
Hey....
Hi.

Uhh-- Well, there are these                         * clans...we're not sure how many.                    *
Nine.                                               *
Okay. Nine. Nine clans. And                         * they apparently have been                           * supplying assassins to governments                  * or anyone who happens to have one                   * hundred pounds of gold lying                        * around for the last thousand                        * years. Give or take.                                *
His name was Jin.                                   *
You knew him?                                       *
He was not born an "Assassin".                      *
...you're from his clan ?                           *
Then...why did you stop him?                        *
The clans have three kinds of                       * people! People with power.                          * People with money. Or people                        * hunting them.                                       *
They're coming.
Who?
The Hanta-Kirra.
Does that mean what I think it means?
They won't stop until you are                         * dead.                                                 *
Oh god.                                               *
The gun won't help you.
I don't have a lot of options okay. I once took a Tae Bo class, but that's the extent of my Kung Fu abilities.
I can help but you must tell me                       * something first.
What?
You saw Ms. Sabatin.                                  *
How did you know that?                                *
I've been watching you, waiting                       * for them.                                             *
Did she give you something?                          *
You have them?
But I can get them.
We need something black. Hurry!                      *
Follow me.    Step where I step.
Raizo.
He's taken the girl.
Weakness compels strength.
Betrayal begets blood.
GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08     52.
This is the law of the Nine Clans. This is the way of the ninja.
I'm going to have to make a phone call in order to get the manuscript.
Not now.   Just drive.
Where?
Does not matter. Just get as far away from here as fast as you can without drawing attention.
You think they're following us?
I know they're following us.  GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08   53. 63   CONTINUED:                                                   63
I don't see anything back there.
They have our scent.
Following our scent?    Like dogs?
No. Like Wolves.
How do you know so much about them?
I was one of them.
You flunked out of ninja school or something?
...something.
You may remove the blindfold.
Your entire life has brought you to this moment. Do not fail yourself. Do not fail your family.
He is wearing a black and gold watch. Bring it to me.
Wait here.   Gotta piss.
Want me to come with you, boss?
Why? So you can shake it for me? You some kind of secret faggot?
The fuck-?
That kinda tickled...
Gonna take more than a knitting needle to fuck me up, boy.
Keep it. It will remind you that every minute of your life is a gift that I have given you.
You have made me proud tonight, Raizo. There are some who believed you would fail, but I knew you would not.
You have a strength inside you Raizo. You must use that strength, now to show me that you are truly Ozunu.
Weakness compels strength. Betrayal begets blood.
A daughter that turned her back on her family. She tried to run. Takeshi hunted her down.
It is the law of the Nine Clans.
Kill him!
Okay, if you're not going to say anything, do you mind if I talk? When I get nervous, it helps if I talk.
My name is Mika by the way.
I know.
Yeah, well usually if someone introduces themselves it is a convention that the other person does likewise.
Raizo...is the name I was given.
So, you were an orphan?
Interesting nature verses nurture case study I imagine.
If it's okay with you, I'll try to fill in some of the blanks. You must have been taken by the Ozunu clan, trained to be an assassin, but something happened and you decided to opt out of the program. I don't imagine this went over so well and since they're after me for just peeking through the keyhole, they must be after you in a major way. But you are also after them or you wouldn't have bothered going to Sabatin. Which I figure means you're searching for the location of The Orphanage because that's obviously the only information Battatu's book would have that you wouldn't already know.
Yeah, I got some moves too. I'm pretty lethal with the research thing.
But here's a question I can't answer: since you didn't know I went to Sabatin's, why did you save me?
Ninja only kill two kinds of people. The first kind has power and money. The other kind is trying to stop them.
Exit here.
I understand retail therapy as well as any girl but I think it's a little late.
You are a size 36?
What? No! Size 34...`cept certain times of the month.
If you leave while I am gone they will catch you and kill you.
Do you understand that?
We need a hotel.
Get undressed. Shower. Do not use the hotel soap. Or any towel. Do you smoke?
No.
Put your clothes in here.
Hey-
What?
Don't you know how to knock?
I'm trying to save your life.
...okay right.
Dry yourself with this.
...I'm just a researcher. I'm really not equipped to deal with this...
Get dressed.
These are a little tight.
You said 34.
European sizes...run a little small I guess.
This is for my "scent"?
Let's go.
Wow. They teach you that at ninja school?
Most locks are not worth the metal they're made of.
You're going to steal a car?
Just borrow it.
Get in.
In for a penny, in for a pounding.
At ninja school I minored in electrical engineering.
Now we have some time.
How much time?
A day.    Maybe less.
Jesus.
Make your call.
Ryan, it's me.
Mika! For Christ sake I've been calling for hours!
I know.   I'm in a bit of trouble-
Trouble? You miss jury duty you're in trouble. You're in some kind of bottomless pit of deep shit.
Yeah. Least I'm not down here by myself...
Your guardian angel? Is it him? The one from the tape?
He's on our side, Ryan.   I trust him.
Careful, Mika.
I promised him the Battuta pages. Do you still have them?  GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   64. 77   CONTINUED:                                                    77
...yeah, I got them.
Can you meet us? In three hours?
Where?
How bout the usual?
There he is.
He's a good man. It's all right.
Mika!
You're all right?
Thanks to him.
Why have you done this?
Done what?
Step back Mika.
What?
People will die.  GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08     65. 78    CONTINUED:                                                     78
NOW!
No!
Hands on your head! On your knees! Do it now!
Raizo!   No!   This is wrong!
The clans have people everywhere.
What are you doing?
Following orders.
Cut him.
All failure must be sown into the flesh.
Cut him!
What?
You know the law!
You will wear this disgrace for the rest of your life!
Prisoner is secure sir.
Right.
Something's wrong with the infrared cam.
No sir, we checked it.
Then why isn't he showing up?
We think he's able to lower the temperature of his body to remain neutral.
Or maybe he's just cold-blooded.
Ryan, you know this is wrong!   It can't be legal! What is this place? Your own private Guantanamo?
It's an old GDR safehouse. Jamison wants this off the grid.
Ryan you're making a huge mistake!
I don't think so. We got reports from Washington, London, Osaka all tagging your boy. Only problem we have is where to extradite him first.
So two weeks ago, there's no such thing as a ninja and now every city in the world has a warrant for one?
We must respect the jurisprudence of the regional government and corresponding law enforcement agencies.
He's not the enemy.
No? You ever heard of Stockholm Syndrome I'm getting the feeling I'm looking at a pretty serious case of it.
I'm not crazy.     This is!
He's a killer, Mika. Weren't you the one telling me it was our job to stop him.
You're not listening to me!
You're not saying anything worth hearing. Look, if want to do the insubordination tango, let's go, but not in front of the kids okay? Boys, give us a minute.
Damn it, Ryan, I --
Listen to me, we don't have much time. Look, I don't know what you've stumbled into, but somebody is pulling some major strings inside.
They want him dead. He's been fighting them for years.
I believe you.  I believe you. I've been in this business too long not to smell a set-up. But we have to be careful how we handle this. And I can't risk you going AWOL on me again, because --  -- because I don't want anything to happen to you.
 GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08   68. 82   CONTINUED:                                                   82
If trouble comes, turn this on, no matter where, and I'll find you.
You shouldn't do that they'll catch you.
Then they'll catch me.
They'll put you in the box.
Yes. They will.
I told you.   I tried to warn you.
...yes, you did....
But you did it anyway.   Why?
Why am I in here for watering my tree...or why are you out there... watering me?
Could you give us a moment?
Negative.   Not safe ma'am.
If he wanted to hurt me he could have done that a while ago.
Sorry ma'am. Maslow okayed the water. That's it.
Hi...you looked thirsty.
I'm sorry...I didn't know about this.
I know.
You do?
The only time you lied to me was when you told me your size.
How did you know that?
Your heart.   It is special.
You know about my heart?
Hearts speak truer than tongues.
Listen, Maslow is on our side. He's going to try to help you.
It's too late. All that matters is the Rihla. Get the manuscript before they get here.
The Hanta Kirra?
Hurry.
Ryan, can I talk to you?
We have to do this again, Coretti?
No sir. I just...I have reason to believe that a group of ninja may be on their way here.
I think these gentlemen can handle a few whack-jobs wearing pajamas. Am I right?
See?
But the situation we discussed-
I'm working on that. You have to give me a little time.
We don't have time.
They're not here now.
They'll be here soon.
How soon-
Raizo--
Mika!
Go with her! Secure the prisoner!
Christ--
What the fuck's with the lights?
We got some guys in pajamas comin' to play spin the bottle.
Huh huh. I got something they can wrap their lips around.
I don't have time for this shit. We have to move the prisoner.
Mika!
You've got to get out of here!
Not without you.
Then we all die together.
Is that..?
Fuck me...
What the fu--
They're not showing up on IR!
Come on--come on--
Mika?
Shh!
I don't want to sound critical--
Got it!
Go. Find Maslow.
Go quick.
Mika!
Jesus Ryan--
I thought you were--
Are you ok?
I hope that wasn't my liver. Gonna need that soon.
Come on.
Fuck!
What?
The manuscript--
No Mika--
Right...
Two minutes.    Keep it in gear.
Maslow--
Tip-toe.
Come on, Ryan...
Hurry the fuck up!
Motherfuckfuckfuck--
Ryan- I had to leave!
Good, stay clear.
Do you have the map?
Not yet.   We're heading upstairs now.
Where's Raizo
He took off.   We think they went after him.

This is the end for you, brother.
Raizo!
What were you doing in the street?!
...waiting for you...
You have to go to a hospital.
No. Not a hospital.     Another place.
What is it?   What --
GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT    6/4/08   79.
...dong-xia leaves...three of the lo-chan...dragon root...
You should not mix these.    Very dangerous.
If you are in pain...if you wish to die...there are other ways, this will be agony --
No...it will save me....
It will?  You're sure?  Let me write this down.
Hot water.
I have to sleep now...a day at least.
A day?!?     What should I do?
...keep moving...  GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08     80. 100   CONTINUED:                                                    100
I'll have him to go.  Can you...help me to the car?
Mika, where are you?
Moving.   He told me to keep moving.
He's still alive?
After a fashion.
Let us bring you in.
Not this time.
Mika, the situation's a little different. Jurisprudence goes out the fucking window when my men get attacked.
Do you have the manuscript?
...negative. They got to my office. Everything's gone.
Mika, it's gonna be all right. We'll find them.
...but I promised...
We'll keep your promise. They're too many people involved now. It's just a matter of time.
I don't think we have much time...
Just tell me where you are.
Mika? Mika? Dammit.
I know you can't hear me, so I'm sure this doesn't matter, but I'm going to say it anyway.
I'm a forensic researcher, okay? That's like a fancy way of saying I'm a librarian. By myself I can't do anything to help you.
I wanted to think you for saving my life.
And I hope you can forgive me for this.
Agent Maslow, the tracking device--
You've got a lock?
Triangulating her position now.
They took him.     Ten minutes ago. He's gone.
...no!
Kiriko!   You can't leave!
I have to.
Why?
Because my heart is telling me too.
The Hanta Kirra will come for you.
Then they will come.
You know the law. He will cut your heart from your chest.
No...He can never touch my heart.
Come with me.
Where? What is out there?
Life.
...My life is here.
Why are you doing this?
Because I can't watch you become something you are not.
We have been betrayed.
A child of mine, my daughter, betrayed us. She refused these gifts. Rejected our clan.
Hers is a shame that can only be purged with blood.
You who returned her shall have this honor.
You are Ozunu. Your life is meaningless compared to the survival of the Clan. This is our deepest truth. Because of it, we have endured for hundreds of years, and will endure for hundreds more.
Weakness compels strength. Betrayal begets blood. This is the way of the Nine Clans.  This is the way of the Ninja.
I have waited many years for this moment. I have dreamed it, many times.
You will suffer for seven days, one day for each year you defied me.
For seven days, we will...take...from you, as I have just done. Everyone here will take from you. Piece by piece. You will live through it all, you will feel through it all. You will watch as the birds fight over the pieces.
You will know pain like no other human being has ever known.
Your death will be remembered for a thousand years as a testament to the will and strength of the Ozunu Clan.
Father...
No more grenades, not until we get the children out!
What took you?
You knew I'd come?
Just because I was asleep doesn't mean I couldn't hear you.
And I forgive you.
Come, little brother, let us play like old times
No death tasted as sweet as hers.
I watched you die when I pierced her heart. You have always been too weak to be Ozunu.
You have not forgotten your training. You will always be mine, child.
Perhaps this is the best way for you to die.
The breath I take after you are dead, will be the first of my life.
Die you fuck!
Bitch!
Raizo
Mika! Run!
Where is he?   I can't see him!
Get away!
Mika!
What happened?
She saved my life.
She will be all right.
How can you be sure?
Her heart is special.
Medic!    Over here now!
Is she going to be okay?
I don't know...she's got a hole right through the middle of her heart...but shes not really bleeding, that badly...
My heart...
...is over here.
...you gotta be fucking kidding me.
...Raizo?
He said you saved his life.
So you kept your promise. Can we go home now?
You shouldn't do that.
I believe the heart of a tree knows which way it needs to grow.
Everything has a heart.
I don't.
GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT    6/4/08     95.
Hello...hello in there. It said it was happy to meet me and that it missed you.
Come with me!
