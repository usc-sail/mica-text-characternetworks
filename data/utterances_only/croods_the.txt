With every sun comes a new day. A new beginning. A hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday.
But not for me. My name's Eep. This, is my family, the Croods. If you weren't clued in already by the animal skins and sloping foreheads - we're cavemen. Most days we spend in our cave, in the dark. Night after night, day after day. Yep. Home sweet home. When we did go out, we struggled to find food in a harsh and hostile world. And I struggled to survive my family.
We were the last ones around. There used to be neighbors. The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth. The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake. The Erfs, mosquito bite. Throgs, common cold. And, the Croods. That's us. The Croods made it...
Because of my Dad. He was strong... and he followed the rules.
... the ones painted on the cave walls. Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad, going out at night is bad. Basically, anything fun is bad. Welcome to my world.
But this is a story about how all that changed in an instant.
Because what we didn't know, was that our world was about to come to an end. And there were no rules on our cave walls to prepare us for that.
Raaaaar grooooOOOOoooowwwll ERF ERF Glaaaaaabbbbllllllllthhhh!
You're supposed to wait for my signal Eep. Eep?
We've been in that cave forever.
Three days is not forever.
It is with this family.
Eep would you come down here? You're being so dramatic.
No, no, no Sandy, come back here. Remember the signal. Good girls wait for the signal.
Ugga. UGGA As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in, and you can give the signal.
No, I mean, you're already out now.
I am waiting for the signal, dad.
Never mind, Thunk. Just, come out.
 Uhh, but if you don't give the signal, how do I know you're my dad?
The signal isn't so you know it's me, it's so you know I wasn't eaten by an animal.
Then why is the signal an animal noise? I mean, doesn't that just confuse things?
I don't know... I'm still waiting for the signal.
Sigh. Hoo hooooo! Hoo hooooo!
Mom, we're ready to leave.  Mom!
Still alive!
It's still early.
And you're still fat.
Breakfast formation!
I want to see some real caveman action out there. We do this fast. We do this loud, we do this as a family and never not be afraid. Go!
YAY, BREAKFAST!!!!
 Yeah... breakfast...
Who's up?
We'll flip for it.
Call her in the air.
Heads.
Tails. Thunk's in.
Positions.
Ok. Thunk. Go. Come on Thunk.
Hah! Way to go. Take it to the cave!
Oooh!
Release the baby.
Get um Mom! Do it for the Croods!
Old lady down! Eep, avenge me.
Thanks!
Eep!
Heads Up!
Oh hey Dad, can we eat now?
Just wait till we get home. Eep put on the brakes.
Eep!
Who's hungry?
Alright! Good one, dad!
Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.
Sorry, dad.
Looks like fast food tonight!
That's alright. I ate last week.
Two knuckle warning.
Come on Croods. Go, go, go.
Come on, come on. Darkness brings death! We know this.
The moon is full. Bath night. (grumbling, Gran tries to run AWAY) You too, Mom.
Run for your life.
I don't want to lose my protective layer.
Mom, you've got ants. 
See? Sandy doesn't fuss.
 Aaaaaaaaaah.
Is she still out there?
You know she hates the cave, Grug.
Please come back tomorrow.
How can she not like the cave? It's so cozy.
It is a little, dark, Grug.
It's not that dark.
 Eep! Eep?
Come on, I gotta close the cave...
Eep!
Okay, okay!
Come on.
EEP! COME DOWN!!
SIGH
That was too close!
I was watching. I was fine.
What were you doing up there, Eep?
I don't know.
What were you looking for?
Nothing.
Well then why did you go up there?
 I don't know. GRUG Why don't you know? Stop looking for things. Fear keeps us alive Eep. Never not be afraid.
 What's the point of all this?
Hmmm? What was that?
 I mean, why are we here? What are we doing this for?
GROAN
No one said survival was fun.
Nothing is fun.
Hmm? Would you come down here. Eep?
Grug. Off.
Yes.
Off!
I just don't see why she needs her own ledge. That's all. That's what this is about.
She's working through some things and needs her own space.
What things? How long is this going to take? Really? I mean she already doesn't listen to me.
Hey!
See? She's listening.
If she wants to survive, she has to follow our rules.
How about a story? Eep loves those.
 That's a good idea ... How about a story, huh?
Oh yeah, tell us a story.
Ok. Can I borrow that? Thank you. Eep! Your old favorite?
I haven't played with that thing in years.
Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy Bear.
As Grug talks, he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall of the cave.
A long time ago, this little bear was alive. She was alive because she listened to her father and lived her life in routine and darkness and terror. So she was happy. But Krispy had one, terrible problem. She was filled with... curiosity.
Grug!
Yes. And one day, while she was in a tree, the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top.
Wha?
And no sooner than she climbed to the top, she saw something new and died.
Just like that?
Yes! Her last moments of terror still frozen on her face.
Oh, same ending as everyday.
 I get it, dad. I get it. I will never do anything new or different.
Good man, Thunk.
Alright, everyone sharpen your teeth and let's pile up.
The canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light - it will be gone in another few seconds. With one of her hands pressed tightly to the cave `door', she steels herself.
Nuh! Nuh!
No!
Augh!
AAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHH!
Shhh!
Ow!
 Air.
...You talk.
I'm a person, like you.
Sort of... like you.
Okay, could you not, hee hee hee, that tickles. Hey!
Augh!
OW! Wow. --
Quiet! I'm not supposed to be out here.
OW!
 Eep's gone.
What? Grug!
Stay in the cave!
 Wow. You're really strong.
No! It's mine. No, no. I caught it!
It's dying. I can fix it!
Please. I hate the dark.
It does what you tell it?
Well, yeah, sort of.
The sun?
No, no. Fire.
 Hi, fire.
 It's not alive. EEP But you said it was dying.
Uh sorry,--
It comes from where you come from?
No. I make it.
Make some for me.
Ow. Okay, it doesn't come out of me.
Make. MAKE! MAKE IT!
You do this a lot.
Are you dead? Can I have your fire if you're dead?
Hey, those are cold!
Squirf!
You think? Listening shells, activate.
I concur. Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately. He tries to pull her by the arm. She stays put like an anchor.
I don't even know you.
 Ow. I'm Guy.
Guy?
And this is Belt. Cook, conversationalist, navigator, also keeps my pants up.
Hhiiyaa! Yaaa!
What are "pants up?"
Who are you?
Eep.
 Let me clarify, Eep. The world is ending.
What?
I'm calling it...  The... End.
Da da daaaaa.
How do you know?
I've seen it. It's coming this way. First, the Earth is going to shake. Then it breaks open. Everything falls in. Fire. Lava. I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but Aaaaaaaugh. Believe me, everything we're standing on, all this right here, will be gone.
We've got to get to high ground. I know a mountain, that way--
It's our only chance.  Come with me.
I can't.
Okay. Here. If you survive, call me.
Thank you. Hello? Hey!
Dad!
Are you hurt? What took you?
Nothing. I left on my own.
You... youuuuuuu... ww-what!? EEP Dad, let me explain...
 You never let me talk.
You're grounded.
Hey!
Eep!
Mom!
Grug! What happened!?
You know what, I am so mad right now, that I can't talk to her.
Eep?
You'll never believe it. I found something new.
New?!!!! The Croods all SNATCH up stones. They form a defensive circle.
New's a big problem!
Wait. Wait!
Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.
It wasn't bad.
New is always bad.
No. He was nice.
What!? Excuse me? He?
Oh. Well, I thought he was a warthog, but then he turned into a boy.
Strange. Usually it's the reverse.
Eep's got a boy hog! Eep's got a boy hog!
There was a boy. Watch, okay. I'm gonna call him.
What is wrong with you?
It was dangerous.
 It was beautiful. You want to see dangerous? Here.
Owww! My sniffer!
Okay Eep, that's it. We're going back to the cave and you're going to stay in there until you're older than... her!
What!? You can't keep me inside forever!
He said this would happen.
Get to the cave! GO!
Look out! Stop!
Is everyone okay?
Yes. Grug, the cave, it's gone.
No.
You really need to see this...
We should go there!
No. No one is going anywhere.
What else did that boy say?
Grug?
Just go! Go! Go!
One, two, three, four, five -- BEAT. Grug smiles.
 Six.
 Oh... Where are we?
I don't know, I'm not sure. Down. In a lower place. One thing's for sure, we can't go back the way we came.
Sniff sniff sniff Grrrrrrrrrrr.....
 Sandy? What is it?
No, no! Come back, Sandy!
 We can't be out in the open like this. We need a cave. Now step where I step.
 Okay. Stay quiet. Hopefully nothing big knows we're here yet. PULL BACK - a huge colorful predator, THE MACAWNIVORE senses something. He SITS UP and STALKS OFF.
Wait. Okay. Wait. Okay. Wait. Okay.
 So Dad, just to be clear, are we looking for the exact same cave?  THUNK If it was me, I'm just throwing this out there, if it was me choosing the cave, I would go with a smaller cave.
Wait.
Dad?
I'll take care of this.
WWAAAAaaarrgghhaarrraaaarrgghhh!!
Alright dad, go get `em! Oh, oh, now you got em-- Now they're really hitting you. Dad I got it, just stop running into their fists.
Hah, I'm loving this.
Grug, when you're done, we should get going.
That's right! You can't get past this!
ROOOAR!
GASPS
Climb! Climb! Climb!
CAVE! GO! GO!
Come on! Hurry up, let's go! Come on!
Hey look! This cave has a tongue. Awesome!
Okay, that's one, two, three, four, five... six...
And seven... if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.
Grrrrrrrrr.
Hah! It's scared of the dark... wait... we're scared of the dark.
Kill circle!
Eep! Eeeep!
Ta-da. EEP 
Auughhauhhhgggh!
Raaarr, grOooOOOOowwllll, ERF ERF GLaaabbbllllellelller!
Cavies!
Cavies?
Cavemen! Stand back! They're practically animals. See their bony, sloping foreheads?
Oh... yeah!
The huge primitive teeth?
Er... yeah...
The excessive body hair? Oh, that one's got a tail...
Uhhh... yeah...
Close your eyes. I'm going to have to take their lives.
 No. It won't help.  They're my family.
What?
Ah, the sun is in his hands!
No. No. It's "fire."
Where did it come from?
 He made it.
Make some for me!
It doesn't come out of him.
Make. Make it.
You know, you're a lot like your daughter.
Great, now he's broken.
Oh, it's a baby sun. Grug turns to see Ugga, Thunk, Gran and Sandy are now sitting very close around the fire, transfixed.
Whoa! Stay back. We don't know what it wants.
Now we'll all sit here, and wait for the sun to come back. And tomorrow we'll find a new cave, and pretend today never happened.  GRUG  Isn't this fun, Eep?
Eep, don't touch him. Goodness knows where he's been.
Dad, Sandy's hurting fire.
Sandy! No! Fire is not a play thing!
Aww, what a cute little guy.
Hey, stay back.
No, no, no, wait!
It likes me!  Hey! IT'S BITING ME!!
 Ow! You're not my friend. Stop, stop touching me!
Thunk! Uh, try hiding from it in the tall dry grass!
 Stop please, please. I'm only nine.
Ooh, more fire babies.
Hi.
So, your Dad, he's trying to kill me. EEP Yeah. But I won't let him.
Hold on son, come back!
I don't like you anymore!
Weeeee!!!!
Get out! Out!
Eat up, babies!
Die! Die!
I win!
They're not so scary once you get to know them.
Who are you people?
Oh, I'm sorry. We're the Croooooods! And you are?
Uh, Guy.
 Hi, Guy.
Wow! Looks like magic. And smells like food.
Don't eat it, it's new.
Still alive!
Come on, keep eating.
Squirf!
gasping for air (checks to see if he's been SPOTTED)
Hey, where's Guy?
No!
Going somewhere?
The mountain? High ground? End of the world, remember?
That already happened. It destroyed our cave.
 Noooo. That was just the beginning of the end. The end of the end is still coming.
 Eep. Drop it.
We can't let him go! What if we don't find a cave before sunset? What if it takes a few days? What if the birds come back?
We need his fire, dummy!
Fine. You're staying with us till we find a cave.
What? No I'm not. Don't make me part of this. Stay here if you want, but let me go. I've got a dream, a mission, a reason to live.
 Not anymore.
 Umm... I've got an idea. Let's go to that mountain.
 It's too far.
Dad really has his heart set on a cave.
Uh, there, are, caves on that mountain.
Have you been there?
It's a mountain. Mountains are safe. Mountains have caves. And water. And sticks.
Mom? Did you hear that? I can get my own stick!
Yes. Sticks. Caves and sticks. Crazy sticks. Let's go.
Da da daaaaa.
Ugh. That thing is weird.
No no, it's okay Sandy. That's just a belt.
I've made a decision. We're going to, that mountain! Don't ask me why. It's just a hunch. It just feels right.
I don't know Grug. We've never really walked that far.
I don't think my feet can do that.
I'll never live long enough to get there.
 Let's do it.  Oh come on, just think. Our whole family, packed together on a long, slow trip across country? Days and nights with just each other. We'll tell stories. We'll laugh.  We'll become closer as a family.
Aaaaaaaaugh. Get her off. Get off.
If you're not ready to challenge her, then don't look her in the eye.
Could you keep your big giant arms on your side of the trail!
No more touching. No more touching.
Isn't this fun? We're taking our first trip together.
Stop shoving, or I will pull out your tongue!
Do you want me to turn this family around? Do you?! Because I will turn this family around so fast!
The Croods are traveling across the dry land. The camera has pulled out from the family as they travel. Family chaos continues.
Dad, I gotta go!
Come on, you can hold it.
I don't think so.
 I gotta go really bad.
 Go behind one of those lumpy things and make it fast.
Ow! Something bit me!
 I don't blame it.
Maybe we should have stopped for water.
Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?
No.
How about now?
No.
Now? GRUG No.
NOW?!?!
NO!
NOW?!?!
I can do this all day long. No, no, no, and still no.
I'm not dying on an empty stomach.
Grug, we're all pretty tired.
I'm pretty dizzy, so I'm just going to lay down for a minute.
We'll eat when we get there.
It's taking too long! I'm grabbing a snack.
No. No. No. Don't do that. He will cut you. That's not food, he's a pet. My pet.
What's a pet? GUY An animal that you don't eat.
We call those children.
No man should have a pet. It's weird, and wrong. It's--  ...It's food!
No, no please!
Not that. That.
Food fixes everything.
Alright, show me your hunting face.
Arrgh.
Not you! You're still grounded!
Come on, Thunk.
My feet hurt.
You look tense.
I'm not tense.
Angry girl wants to be doing what they're doing.
Ow! I wasn't ready!
Hang on Thunk, I'm coming!
Why are you doing this?
What are they doing?
Hunting.
Get it off! You stay away from me.
No seriously, what are they doing?
 You've got a ton of eggs. Just make another egg!
Now you're just rubbing it in. ON A GIANT BRONTO SCORPION
There! Who's hungry for scorpion?
What happened to the egg and the bird?
 You know, we lost him. But when the bird stepped on me and pushed me into the ground, the scorpion grabbed a hold of me and one thing led to another and here we are eating him. Win win.
Not enough. Not enough. I need more. I need more!
 Oh, look at that. She's not gonna eat me right?
You're too skinny. If she was gonna eat anyone it would be--
AAAAAAAAAUUGHHHHHHHH!
Owww! She's locked her jaw!
Mom!
Someone get a stick! Get her off!
Oh you sick old monster! Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth!
Hold her still. Use a rock. Ugga would you just hit her legs.
Why are you rolling away?
Owww! I just want something to eat.
You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!
Please... I'll let you help me hunt.
Really?
Ahhh! They're all over me... Tell my story...
Okay. Guy carefully SETS the trigger.
What do you call this?
A trap.
What does it do?
 soft whistle Raargh, Thump thump thump, thubububububub soft whistle poom! Tadaaaaaa!
How long have you been alone?
... So what do we do?
How's your acting?
Oh, you're good at this.
Oh, sorry, I...
Just move your arm... no, your other arm. Oh, that one's mine.
Uh... It didn't step in your trap-y, thing.
Yeah, I noticed.
Where's Eep?
She's awesome.
Eep!
Dad, no!
It's an avalanche of flavor.
 Looks like we won't be having any leftovers.
What are "left-overs?"
 You know, when you have so much food to eat you have some, left over.
We never have that much food.
Grug, how about a story?
That's a good idea. How about a story huh?
Yeah a story, tell us a story!
Once upon a time there was a little tiger who lived in a cave with her family. There were a lot of rules, but the big, simple one was to never leave the cave at night. And the door was so heavy, you'd think it would be easy to remember.
So easy to remember!
I know! But, while everyone was asleep, she went out anyway.
No!
Yes! And no sooner than she did, her cave was destroyed and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk, with some weirdo they met, and died! The end.
Whoa! I did not see that coming. Twist ending. My stories never end like that.
Yes! Two stories in one night!
Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's. Um, once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger. She lived in a cave with the rest of her family. Her father and mother told her, "You may go anywhere you want but never go near the cliff, for you could fall."
And die. Good story.
But when no one was looking, she would go near the cliff, for the closer she came to the edge, the more she could hear, the more she could see, the more she could feel. Finally, she stood at the very edge, and she saw a light. She leaned out to touch it, and slipped.
And she fell.
And she flew.
GASP
Where did she fly?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
A place with more suns in the sky than you can count.
It would be so bright.
A place not like today, or yesterday, a place where things are better.
Tomorrow isn't a place, you can't see it!
Oh yes, yes it is. I've seen it. That's where I'm going.
Well, WE are going to shut our eyes and sleep. And when we wake up we're going to find the place that has everything we want.
Tomorrow?! GRUG A cave.
snoring, tossing and turning
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHH.
That was too close. It almost caught us.
I was watching. We were fine.
We've got to move faster. Do you people have any other speed aside from "wander?" I'll take a shamble at this point.
Hey, do you have a minute? How did the tiger fly?
I only share when I'm outside the log. I'm funny that way.
 Leave this to me.
Hey Thunk, you have a spider on your face.
 Oops.
He's loose!
Aaaaahhhhhh! Do not step on those weird, pointy rocks!
You mean these rocks? Ahh owww! Do not step on these rocks!
Step aside, girls!
Hello? Nobody's listening! No one is listening. You cannot walk on those!
Arraughrragh come back here now.
Well, there goes our chance for survival.
And our log!
Okay. Arraugh!
Ow, ow, ow.
Ow! Jumping doesn't help, I mean, just briefly, but it doesn't get better! Ow! Do not walk on your hands, the hands do not help at all.
Eeccoomme on!
I can help you, but we're going to have to make a few changes around here. The log ride is over. Drop the log.
Now, kick it away.
Farther.
Really?!
Okay, smart, Guy... now what?
Ahhhh! Good fish.
Okay. Now you can look.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh! I love them! Where are my feet!? GUY They're still there!
Oh, okay.
Whoa. You're really  ... heavy.
Really? Thank you!
Hey, wait. Whoa. Whoa. WHOA!!
 Okay! She's up. I'm good. We're good...
These shoes are great! Where do you get these ideas?
Ah ha.
I'm calling it, a brain. I'm pretty sure it's where ideas come from.
Dad. I don't have a brain.
We've gotten along just fine without brains till now. Cavemen don't need brains. We have these. Heeya! Haha!  That's what I'm talking about! Ideas are for weaklings. Grug punches at the air in front of Guy making him wince.
Now, let's get to that mountain.
Oh wow. I love those!
Good fish. Don't eat my feet.
So... How'd the tiger fly?
He jumped on the sun and rode it to tomorrow.
No, no, no! The family moves across, Grug is the last to follow.
Ooowwwww!
Hi dad! Bye dad!
You've seen rain before... right?
We don't get out much.
Hmmmmm. Belt makes an Origami boat. He and Sandy sail across the rain puddles.
 Eep, looks dangerous.
Oh dad, you say that about everything.
Careful.
Oh really? Okay.
Augh! No no no! Not cool. Not cool. Not cool.
So the bear says, "Your cave?" I've been dumping my bones here since last week.
Last week, haha. That's a funny story!
It's not a story! It's a joke.
What's a joke?
You know, just making something up... to make you laugh.
Hah, I don't get it.
Here you go, one for you, and this ones for you.
Thanks.
Okay. Okay. That's enough. I don't see why the kids need their own shells.
So if anyone gets in trouble, we can call the others.
Wait-- you're saying we should split up?
We can try more paths at once. It's the fastest way through.
Croods stick together.
Your way isn't safe.
They can handle it.
We can do it, dad.
No no no no no. It's my job to keep you safe. I'm still in charge and we are not splitting up.  Except for you two. And that's final.
Oh, hello.
 Hello? Is everyone alright?
 We're okay, Grug.
Dad? I'm freaking out a little bit. Just tell me what to do. Just what do I do right now?
Stay where you are. I'll find you.
No. Too slow. Everybody, keep moving forward and we'll get out.
Dad?
 Yeah. Okay.
Remember never not be afraid.
You can do this.
It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna pass out.
You dropped these.
Come with me.
Here boy, catch!
Gran?
Mom?
 Raaah raaah.
Grug?
I'll go get him.
Good boy. Whose my good boy? You need a name, you want a name? I'm going to call you - Douglas. Look at him. Can you do tricks? Roll over. Come on Douglas, roll over.
Good boy Douglas!
I was in love once. He was a hunter, I was a gatherer. It was quite a scandal. We fed each other berries. We danced.  GRAN Then my father smashed him with a rock and traded me to your Grandfather.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha.
 Croods! Come get down here!
Grug, they're okay. Guy's with them.
Oh, oh, `Guy'. `Guy' is with them. Well thank you for bringing me that interesting Guy update!
Oh, okay. I'm gonna go up and why don't you join us when you stop being a big drag!
Grug isn't thrilled with Ugga's shot at him. He picks up two rocks and tries to make fire.
Sleep pile? How about a story, huh? Anyone?
And then Torg said "Know it? I drew it!"
That makes no sense.
 I know it was hard for you to bring us along, but they had the best day of their lives... Thank you for that.
I want to show you something.
More suns in the sky than you can count.
Every sun that crosses our sky, comes to rest up there.
Tomorrow.
That's where we'll be safe.
I'm going with Guy.
 No. Not my little girl.
Come with us.
I can't go without Grug.
Well, that makes one of us. Count me in!
Really Mom? Now?
Grug has no idea how to protect us. In fact, he has no ideas at all.
No, that's not true. What about that one time when he a...
Face it! If he actually had an idea of his own I'd, I'd have a heart attack and die!
Grug smiles to himself.
Grug?
Dad?
Dad?
He's a big guy. How can he just disappear like that?
Hey wait. Let's ask that ugly lady if she's seen dad.
Yeah.
Haven't seen him.
Augh!
 What are you doing?
 Yeah, Wow. Like, I was up all night cuz like all these, ideas just kept coming to me.
Is that a snake?
Belt! New and improved! It's even self- tightening. Ow!
What is that on your head?
It's called desperation.
 I call it a "rug." Rhymes with Grug. And this one. I call it a "ride." Rhymes with Grug.
That, doesn't--
It's gonna get us places faster than shoes.
Yeah. Try to keep up.
I wish I had a ride.
Painting is a thing of the past. I call this, a "snap-shot."
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.
I call them "shades."
The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore! Where do you get these great ideas?
Since I don't have a brain, they're coming from my stomach. Down deep below, and then up again into my mind.
Grug. We have to keep moving.
See, I got ideas, I got thoughts.
Like this. I call it a "mobile home." Isn't that something?
And I'm calling this one a "lifterator."
Mom?
I know. It's bad.
I almost feel sorry for him.
Hah, no I don't.
What are you trying to do Grug?
I thought if I could have ideas like Guy, maybe Eep would listen to me. Maybe she wouldn't want to go with Guy.
Oh Grug, is that what this is all about?
And I also thought it would kill your mother. So you know? Win win.
We're here.
Cave! Everyone inside. Come on! Hurry up, let's go. Go, go.
No.
 No more caves, Grug.
What?
We're gonna jump on the sun and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy.
Wait, so you're all going to do this?
Thunk?
Sorry, dad.
You have to stop worrying for all of us. GRUG It's my job to worry. It's my job to follow the rules.
The rules don't work out here.
They kept us alive.
That wasn't living, that was just, not dying. There's a difference.
Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me.
We would be dead if we listened you.
We have to follow Guy now.
Guy?
Guy, run.
AAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
This is pointless. We're running out of time. Everything is collapsing. You're being irrational and counterproductive.
Big words anger me. Keep talking.
Countermeasures.
Remember how you were this morning? You changed, remember? Idea man? Modern man?
I... am... a... CAVEMAN.
No, no, no wait.
Hnnnnnngh! No. What is this stuff that saves you from my punches?
 Tar.
Please Grug. You have to stop struggling.
No. I have to get back to them.
Grug! Stop!
No one gets out of this. Believe me. I know.
Your...?
Family. Yeah.
Sorry.
I was little when it happened. The last thing my parents told me was, "Don't hide. Live. Follow the Sun. You'll make it to Tomorrow."
You followed the light. My daughter is a lot like you.
No. She's like you. She loves you but always forgets to say it. Just like you forget to tell her.
 I guess I was just busy keeping them all alive.
It's okay. That's what Dads do.
Come on. You can do it.
Belt! Emergency Idea Generator, activate!
Ow!  I've got it!
TA-DAAAAA
Wow.
Yeah, I know. But he's doing the best with what he has. Let's go.
There he is. Belt, I want romance, drama, sincerity. Move me.
Okay he sees us! Belt plays a little melodramatic tune.
That's our cue. Now work it!
He's not coming over. I don't think our puppet looks scared enough.
Scared? I'll show you scared. Hand me those acting sticks!
Hold on!
Da da daaaaaa...
Yes. You did it!
Grug.
Dad!
Hey, we're okay!
Yeah, we're okay.
Grug. Your call.
Take us to Tomorrow.
Hurry! Come on. We're gonna make it!
You were right.
There it is. The sun. We can do it! We can ride it to Tomorrow.
Run!
I don't understand. The sun was right here. It was right here.
We have to go back to the cave. Hurry, hurry, stay together. Let's keep moving. Move, move! Everybody hold my hand. Thunk let's go. Go! Let's stay together.
Grug? What's wrong with you? Grug we'll die if we stay here!
 Grug. Listen to me. We've gotta get back to that cave.
No more dark. No more hiding. No more caves.
What's the point of all this?
To follow the light.
I can't change. I don't have ideas. But I have my strength. And right now that's all you need.
No. We don't know what's over there. Maybe nothing. It's too risky.
It's a chance.
I'll take that chance.
You know, I've wanted to throw you away ever since I met you.
Heh. That's a joke, right?
What's a joke?
He made it... He made it...
Okay, Thunk. Your turn.
You're not coming, are you?
When you make it, so will I.
You did good.
Daddy.
Gran.
No mush, just throw me.
Wait. You surprised me today. Lunkhead.
 Still alive!!!
Time to go.
No. I have too much to say to you. I need to fix everything and I don't have time.
I can fix it.
This works good. What do you call it?
I was thinking of calling it a Hug.   GRUG Because it rhymes with Grug. But you can change it if you want.
No. I like a "Hug."
I love you.
I...
Dad, I'm scared.
Never be afraid.
There. I see him!
 Hey, I did it.
Ahhhh! Back! Stay back! Stay back!
They're in trouble. Hang on! I'm coming.
How do I get across? Gotta think. What would Guy do? What would Guy do?
What would I do?
Hold this.
I... have... an... IDEA!
Erm?
Run! Grug leaps onto the Macawnivore's back as the birds move in closer. The ground begins to break up violently as lakes empty themselves and entire forests turn sideways.
Yes!
Douglas?
Hey, I know that guy.
Get up!
Hold on.
It's not safe here.
I'll tell her.
I never got to tell him.
Eep, if your Dad were here, he would tell YOU TO--
GET OUT OF THE WAY!!!
Wow, you sound just like him.
GET OUT OF THE WAY!!!
Daddy! EEP He did it!
He's riding the Sun... but not very well. Everybody out of the way!
Dad!
Grug!
Ahhh! Where's the danger? Who blew their shell?
I love you too.
One, two, three, four, five, six...
... and seven.
Eerrghh.
And a half.
And eight, and nine. Douglas runs up and licks Thunk.
Douglas! Dad you saved him!
Well, a boys gotta have a pet.
Turns out, I'm a cat person.
Uh! No.
You really need to see this.
We should go there.
This is me. My name's Eep. And this, is my family. The Croods. If you weren't clued in by the sun tans and pets, we're not exactly cavemen anymore.
Let's do that again. I think I blinked.
Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile. But now we know the Croods will make it.
Because we changed the rules. The ones that kept us in the dark.
And because of my dad, who taught us that anyone can change...
Release the baby!
Well, sort of.
So from now on we'll stay out here.
Where we can follow the light. FLARE TO WHITE
Da da daaaaaaaaaaa.
