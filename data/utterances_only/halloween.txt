REV. 4-10-78
REMOVED
My parents won't be back till ten.
Are you sure?
 We're all alone, aren't we?
Michael's around someplace....
 Take off that thing.
I gotta go.
Will you call me tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
Promise?
Yeah.
Michael...?
Michael?
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
What did you use before?
Thorazine.
He'll barely be able to sit up.
That's the idea.  Here we are.
 The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
Are there any special instructions?
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
If you say so.
Your compassion is overwhelming, . Doctor.
Ever done anything like this before?
Only minimum security.
I see.
 What does that mean?
It means... I see.
You don't have to make this any harder than it already is.
I couldn't if I tried.
The only thing that ever bothers me is their gibberish. When they start raving on and on...
You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
Since when do they let them wander around?
Pull up to the entrance!
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Move it!
What did he say?
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawn mower.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
Something fell on the roof.
Something jumped on the roof...
You can calm down. The evil's gone.
Don't forget to drop off the key at the Myers place...
I won't.
They're coming by to see the house at 10:30. Be sure you leave it under the mat...
I promise.
Hey, Laurie...
Hi, Tommy.
Are you coming over tonight?
Same time, same place.
Can we make Jack-o'-lanterns?
Sure.
Can we watch the monster movies?
Sure.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
Sure. Sure.
You're not supposed to go up there.
Yes, I am.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
Just watch.
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of sixth grade.
I gotta go.  I'll see you tonight.
See you.
 I wish I had you all alone... Just the two of us... I would hold you close to me... So close to me...
 Just the two of us... So close to me...
I'm not responsible, Sam.
 Of course not.
I've given them his profile.
You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year old!
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
There's nothing else I can do.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
Probably going.
I'm wasting time.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there, he can't drive?
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
...and the book ends, but what Samuels is really talking about here is fate.
 You see, fate caught up with several lives here. No matter what course of action Rollins took, he was destined to his own fate, his own day of reckoning with himself. The idea is that destiny is a very real, concrete thing that every . person has to deal with.
TEACHER  Edwin, how does Samuel's view of fate differ from that of Costaine?
Uh... doesn't he feel that no matter how complicated something is, it's also really simple too?
No.  Laurie.
M'am?
Answer the question.
Costaine wrote that fate was somehow related only to religion, where Samuels felt that fate was like a natural element, like earth, air, fire and water.
That's right, Samuels definitely personified fate...
 No, not since Thursday.  Yes, yes I'm all right. Stop worrying. After this I'll sleep for a week, two weeks...  I said I'm all right. Believe me. I'll be home soon. Yes I do. Very much. I just... have to stop him... Of course it's possible, but I know him. And when he gets there, God help us.  Right, right, I'll call you. Me too. Goodbye.
Leave me alone!
He's gonna get you!
He's gonna get you, he's gonna get you...
The Boogeyman is coming!
No he's not. Leave me alone.
He doesn't believe us. Don't you know what happens on Halloween?
Yeah, we get candy.
Oooooo! The Boogeyman!
 The Boogeyman, the Boogeyman, the Boogeyman...
It's totally insane!  We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
Totally!
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
Hey, Lynda, Laurie!
 Why didn't you wait for me?
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
That's not true. Here I am.
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boy's locker room to tell me...
Exploring uncharted territory?
It's been totally charted.
We just talked.
Sure.
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
I thought you were baby-sitting tonight.
The only reason she baby-sits is to have a place to...
Shit!
 I have a place for that.
I forgot my chemistry book.
Who cares? I always forget my chemistry book.
Isn't that Davon Graham?  He's cute.
don't think so...I
 Speed kills!
 Can't you take a joke?
Annie, some day you're going to get all of us in deep trouble.
Totally.
I hate a guy with a car and no sense of humor.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
 I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
 I'm baby-sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
Terrific. I've got three choices.
What time?
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick or treating.
Saving the treats for Bob?
Fun-ny. See you.
Look.
Look where?
Behind that bush there.Annie looks.
I don't see anything.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
 Laurie, my dear, he wants to talk to you.
 He wants to take you out tonight.
He was standing right here.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Cute.
It's tragic. You never go out.
The guys think I'm too smart.
I don't. I think you're whacko.
 Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
Okay. Bye.
Excuse me, Laurie.
Mister Brackett...
Didn't mean to startle you.
It's okay...
Well, it's Halloween. I guess everybody's entitled to a good scare.
Yes, sir. Nice seeing you.
 Well, kiddo, I thought you outgrew superstition.
Hi, Mom, I'm home.
Laurie, Annie just called. She said call her back.Laurie turns and hurries up the stairs.
Thanks, mom.
Hello.
 Hello?
 Who is this?
Hello?
Why did you hang up on me?
Annie, was that you?
Of course.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I've already lost it.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
Sure, see you later.
Bye.
 Calm down. This is ridiculous.
Let's see. Myers. Judith Myers. Row 18, plot 20. Over this way.
 Every town has something like this happen. I remember a guy over is Russellville. Charley Bowles. About fifteen years ago, he finished dinner, excused himself from the table, went out into the garage and got a hacksaw, then came back into the house, kissed his wife and two children goodbye, and then proceeded to...
Where are we?
Just right over there a ways. And I remember Judith Myers. Just couldn't believe it. A young boy like that...
Lost?
 Why do they do it?
Goddamn kids.  They'll do anything on Halloween.
Whose grave is it?
18, 20... Judith Myers...
He came home...
Hurry up.
We just have time.
 You still spooked?
I wasn't spooked.
Lies.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's backyard.
Probably Mister Riddle.
He was watching me.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty- seven.
He can still watch.
That's probably all he can do.
 What's the pumpkin for?
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-o'-lantern would keep him occupied.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Thanks.
For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia.  Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
My dad!
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Hi, Dad. What happened?
 What?
What happened?
Someone broke in the hardware store. Probably kids.
You blame everything on kids.
The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
It's hard growing up with a cynical father.
You're going to be late at the Doyle's, Annie.
 Huh?
 You're going to be late!
 He shouts, too.
Goodbye, girls.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
Lee Brackett.
I'd like to talk with you, if I could.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
It's important.
Ten minutes.
I'll be there.
Anybody live here?
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
They may be right.
What is it?
A dog...
 Still warm.
He got hungry.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
Could have...
A man wouldn't do that...
He isn't a man.
It happened in here.
 She was sitting here when he came through the door.
 He must have watched them through this window...
 Standing just outside, he could . peer over the sill...
 I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
I am. (he glances around the bedroom) I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely, simply evil.
What do we do?
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
I'll check back in an hour.
 ..."How now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?'  'That is so,' answered the knight in a bold and haughty manner..."
I don't like that story.
But King Arthur was always your favorite.
Not any more.
Why are they under there?
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
Laurie, what's the Boogeyman?
Hello.
Having fun? Never mind, I'm sure you are. I have big, big news for you...
Oops! Hold on a minute...
Hi Lester...
Lindsey, Lindsey!  I'm about to be ripped apart by the family dog.
Get him out of here!
Here, Lester.
 I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
 What's this big, big news?
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
Annie you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
You guys will make a fabulous couple.
Laurie...
 I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
 Annie!
Laurie, the Boogeyman is outside. Look!
 Hold on.  There's nobody there, Tommy. Go watch some TV.
 Look, it's simple. You like him, he likes you. All you need is a little push.
 It won't hurt you to go out with him, for God's sake.
 Shit! No, no, I gotta call you back. I just made a mess of myself. Nothing unusual.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again...
No he's not.
Never mind. He found a hot date.
What about the Jack-o'-lantern?
After the movie.
What about the rest of my comic books?
After the Jack-o'-lantern.
 What about the Boogeyman?
There's no such thing.
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
No...
Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
I saw the Boogeyman. I saw him outside.
There was no one out there.
There was.
What did he look like?
The Boogeyman!
We're not getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The Boogeyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
Right.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get you.
Promise?
I promise.
Can we make the Jack-o'-lantern now?
Terrific!
Hello?
 Who's there?
Paul, is this one of your cheap tricks?  I guess not.
No tricks for Annie tonight.
Lindsey! Lindsey, come out here!
Lindsey, I'm in the laundry room!
Lindsey! Lindsey, goddamn it, help!
 Lindsey, answer the phone! It's Paul! Lindsey! LINDSEY!
HELLO.
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
Yes, she is.
Will you get her for me.
She's washing her clothes.
Well, go tell her its me, okay?
Okay.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
You locked yourself in.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
Lindsey, promise you won't tell anyone!
She was stuck in the window, she'll be right here.
Hello, Paul.  All right, cut it out. It can happen to anyone.  Yeah, but I've seen you stuck in other positions!
 That's fantastic! When did they leave?  Utterly fabulous!  So why don't you just walk over?  My clothes are in the wash. I can't come now.  Shut up, jerk. I've got a robe on. That's all you think about.  That's not true. I think about lots of things. Why don't we not stand here talking about and get down to doing them? All right, see you in a few minutes.
 I'm scared.
Then why are you sitting here with the lights off?
I don't know.
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
I don't want to.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other.
I want to stay here and watch this.
Okay, if I can fix it so you can watch TV with Tommy Doyle would you like that?
Yes.
Come with me.
Hi, come on in. We're making a Jack-o'-lantern.
I want to watch TV.
Fancy.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. You'll have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
Wait a minute here...
If you watch her, I'll consider talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
The old girl scout comes through again.
 Oh, Paul, I give you all...
 No keys, but please... my Paul.
 My Paul, I can no longer stall...
 Lucky thing. Spilled butter on her clothes, but nobody will know...  except for Paul...
Hello. Oh hi, Dad.  No, just watching TV with Lindsey.  Be careful about what?  Well, if you won't tell me how can I be careful?  Sure, sure I will. Bye, dad.
 Lindsey. Lindsey.
Where are you?
There he is, there he is! The Boogeyman!
What's wrong?
I saw him again! He's over at Lindsey's house. The Boogeyman!
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
I saw him...
I said, stop it! There is no Boogeyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
Nobody believes me.
I believe you, Tommy.
I'm not afraid.
Bullshit.
I'm not! Then go in.
Chicken!
Go on, Lonnie!
Lonnie...
Get your ass away from there!
Jesus!
You all right?
Sure...
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, parking, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
You have the wrong feeling.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Exactly what do you need?
Well, its going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing this night. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is?  Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
They could be.
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on that chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
Okay. First I rip your clothes off.
You idiot!
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip Lindsey's clothes off. I think I've got it.
Totally...
Bob... Put me down. Put me down. This is totally silly.
Annie, Annie, we're here!
I wonder where they went.
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
Let's don't.
Oooooo... He's gonna get you.
No, he's not.
Nobody's going to get anybody. Now stop scaring each other.
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now.
Let's make more popcorn.
You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of the movie.
Hello.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Is Annie around?
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Well, she's totally not here.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lindsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Okay. Later.
Have a good time.
We sure will.
 Lindsey is gone for the night.
Now that's wonderful.
Shit! Not again.
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
And I can't keep you interested?
Should we answer it?
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
Just answer the damn phone.
I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in trouble.
Take it off the hook.
Fantastic. Totally.
Yeah.
Want a beer?
Yeah.
Is that all you have to say?
Yeah.
Go get me a beer.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Yeah?
I'll be right back. Don't get Dressed.
Goddammit!
Annie, Paul...
Lynda, you asshole!
 All right, Lynda, come on out.
Where's my beer?
 Cute, Bob. Real cute.
 Come here, you fool.The ghost doesn't answer. He continues to stare at Lynda. Can't I get your ghost, Bob?
 All right, all right. So where's the beer.
 Well, answer me! Okay, don't answer me. Boy, are you weird!
 Well, I'm gonna call Laurie.  I wanna know where Annie and Paul are. This isn't going anywhere.
Finally.
Hello.
Hello?
 All right, Annie! I've heard your famous chewing, now I get your famous squeals?
 Annie?
Annie, Annie! Are you all right?
 Are you fooling around again?
 I'll kill you if this is a joke!
 Annie...
Annie?
 Bob, Lynda, Annie?
 Hello?
 Shit.
 All right, meatheads. The joke is over.
 Come on, Annie, enough.
 This has most definitely stopped being funny. Now cut it out!
 You'll be sorry.
Help me!  Help me!
Please, help me! Call the police! Please!
No! No!  Please, open the door!
Tommy!  Tommy, open the door!
Who is it?
Tommy, let me in!
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
What is it, Laurie?
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
I'm scared...
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
It's the Boogeyman, isn't it?
HURRY!
Please stop... Please...
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
I found the car! He's here!
Where!
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street then back down here. I'm going up the . block.
It's all right now. Shhh, it's all right...
 Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
Was it the Boogeyman?
I'm scared!
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
Are you sure?
Yes.
How?
I killed him...
But you can't kill the Boogeyman.
Lock the door! Lock the door!
Tommy, it's me. Open the door.
 Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
You're coming with us...
Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
Laurie, you come with us...
No! Do as I say.
Well, kiddo. Some Halloween...
It was the Boogeyman...
As a matter of fact it was.
