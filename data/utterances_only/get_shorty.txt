Looks fuckin' cold out there.
Guy on the radio said it's gonna get down to thirty-four.
Thirty-four -- that's freezing, for Christ sake.  Yo, Chili, you're spacin'.
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
Yeah.
tall, loud suit with lots of jewelry. As he gets up from the table, the other men around the table follow his lead as he finishes up some jokes . . .
. . . so the guy says, I'm not the tailor, I'm the undertaker.
Ray. How you doing?
Okay, Tommy. You?
Okay.
You believe this weather, Ray? Miami Beach, for Christ's sake.
 Chili Palmer.  Chilly outside. Chili inside. It's a regular fuckin' chili-fest. Hey, waiter -- give Mr. Chili Pepper a big fuckin' bowl of chili!
Good to see you, Ray.
You done starin' out the window, I'll see you back at the office.
Jesus. It's freezin'!
Hey.
What happened to my coat?
It's not one of these?
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Maybe you don't see my sign?
Look, I didn't come down to sunny Florida to freeze my ass. You follow me? You get the coat back or you give me the three seventy-nine my ex-wife paid for it at Alexander's.
Explain to him how Mr. Barboni borrow the coat.
Ray Bones took my coat? Just now?
He didn't take it. He borrow it. See, someone took his coat, you know . . .  . . . leave this old one. So Mr. Barboni, he put on this other coat that fit him pretty good.
You mean my coat.
He was wearing it, you know, to go home. He wasn't gonna keep it.
My car keys were in that coat.
We call you a taxi.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
Mr. Barboni a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
That's what the guy said.
 Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
This is it.
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
Jesus . . . Oh, God . . .
Fuck, man . . .
You been there, haven't you?
Paris? Yeah, I been there plenty times. It's right offa Seventy-nine.
Hell it is. It's on Sixty-eight. Seventeen miles from Lexington.
What're you talking about, Paris, Kentucky, or Paris, Tennessee?
Somebody call 9 fucking 111.
Whatta you want me to do Ray? Go to war over a fuckin coat? You're lucky the guy didn't kill you. The coat was a Christmas present for Christ's sake.
You gotta do somethin', Jimmy. This man's got no respect for us.
He's got no respect for you, and I don't gotta do shit. Chili Palmer don't work for me, he works for Momo up in Brooklyn. So as long as Momo's around, nothing happens to Chili Palmer. You understand?
Momo. We're here.
You check this place out good? If I'm going up alone, I don't want no surprises.
I checked it out, boss.
Yeah?
It's Momo.
Come in.
Surprise!
So what're you tellin' me, you're never gonna go to sleep again?
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.
How many people you hear ever die in a coffee shop?
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
Why don't you geezers take your game over to the park.
This man is the man, you understand what I'm saying? He's Mr. Bones, you speak to him from now on.
You can do better'n him.
Not these days. Not less you can talk Spanish.
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
He died.
How'd you know he died, he tell you?
Yeah, he told me.
Personally?
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
What Get Away jet?
It was in the Herald.
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.
Momo's dead. Which means anything was his now belongs to Jimmy Capp, including you.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
'e.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
Ask your man here.
Best a my knowledge, e.g. means 'for example.'
E.g., i.e., fuck you. The point is, I say jump, you say okay. Okay?
 Yeah, Ray. Okay.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh . . .
Twenty seven hundred.
Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
I told you not to --
Don't say a fuckin' word.
I hate the dry cleaning business. I hate being inside all day, around all those machines.
Must be hot.
You have no idea how hot it is.
I was wondering, Fay, if Leo had any life insurance.
I don't know of any.
I trust you, Chili. I think you're a decent type of man, even if you are a crook.
Thank you Fay.
I wish he really was dead, the son of a bitch.
CLOSE UP OF PHOTOGRAPH
That's him all right.
Called himself Larry DeMille. Hit on every showgirl in town. Would tell 'em he was the 'Martinizing King of Miami'. What a moron.
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
What've you got?
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
What is this?
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I reserved a Cadillac.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
You're kidding me, right?
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
 Harry?
Harry.
Harry, God damn it, somebody's downstairs.
What's wrong?
Be quiet and listen.
I don't hear anything.
Shhh -- there.
Sounds like the television.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
I don't have a dog.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
Harry --
I'm going.
Jesus Christ!
Harry Zimm, how you doing? I'm Chili Palmer.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Where you been, Harry?
Have we met? I don't recall.
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
You're in pictures, right?
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
Harry, look at me.
I'm looking at you.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
That's what I'm doing.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
Jesus Christ, what're you, a collector for a fucking casino? You come in here, walk in the house in the middle of the fucking night? I thought you were an actor, auditioning, for Christ's sake.
Is that right? That's interesting. You thought I was acting, huh?
We'll see about this . . .
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
You don't want to act like a hard-on, you're standing there in your undies. You know what I'm saying? What you want to do is sit down and talk to me.
A marker's like a check, Harry.
I know what a marker is.
They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore . . .
You're not looking at me, Harry.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
I want you to.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Come on, Harry -- Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
Fuckin' basketball game.
Tell Dick Allen I'll cover the markers in the next sixty days at the most. He doesn't like it, that's his problem. The prick.
So, you want me to call you a cab?
You make movies, huh?
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
I think I got an idea for a movie.
Yeah, Leo wore these little plaid hats -- Miami, middle of the summer, this guy thinks no one's gonna notice he's balding, he wears a fuckin' hat.
Karen?
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
How did you get in the house?
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
The door from the patio, in back.
You broke in?
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
What if it was?
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
You just did.
I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
I know what a vig is.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
But the dry cleaner, we'll call him Leo, he's scared, doesn't know any better, so he takes off --
That's Miami. He's going to Vegas. He's got a few bucks and he's thinking it's his only chance.
Leo gets on a plane, ready to go, but the plane sits there at the gate, doesn't move.
They annonnce over the PA there's some kind of mechanical problem, they'll be there maybe an hour, but keep your seats in case they get it fixed sooner.
The guy's nervous, in no shape to just sit there, sweat it out. So he gets off the plane . . .
Goes in the cocktail lounge and starts throwing 'em down, one after the other.
When the plane pulls away from the gate.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
That's right. As a matter of fact . . .
He's still in the lounge when a plane blows up on the runway . . .
So when the guy finds out it was his flight, he can't believe it. If he'd stayed on that plane, he'd be dead. Right then he knows his luck has changed. If everybody thinks he's dead he won't have to pay back the fifteen or what he owes on the vig, four and a half a week.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
That's right. Three percent.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
A real bargain.
Keep going.
Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list . . .
They bring his wife out to the airport where they're going through personal effects, whatever wasn't burned up. Leo's bags were on the plane, so the wife tells 'em what to look for, things only she would know about.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
How much is the wife offered?
Three hundred grand, and they take it, money in hand, babe. The guy has his wife cash the check and he takes off for Las Vegas with the dough. Gets there, he's supposed to call her, tell her when to come out. But she never hears from him again.
He comes to L.A. . . .
It drives the guy nuts, he's winning but can't tell anybody who he is. You show in a back story his motivation, his desire to be famous, you know, pal around with celebrities, the headliners doing the big rooms. Now he's got the dough to buy his way in, mix with celebs and he can't resist . . .
So he comes to L.A. . . .
I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
That's it? That's your movie?
I said I had an idea, that's all.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
The shylock's the good guy.
The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
Harry doesn't realize it's a true story.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
That's where you got the idea?
Part of it, yeah.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
You mean, Leo?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
But you work for the casino?
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
So you don't work for the casino?
Harry, for God's sake . . .
He's the shylock.
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Nice meeting you, Karen.
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
They always paid.
You pack a gun?
Not really.
What does that mean?
Maybe a few times I have.
Ever shot anybody.
Once.
Really? You ever been arrested?
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
Why don't you get to the point, Harry? You want me to do something for you.
Hi, I'm Ray, a friend of Chili Palmer's.
Have your spoken to Mr. Palmer since your husband . . . you know, blew up?
Maybe once or twice.
 What was it you talked about?
Oh, nothing really? This and that.
Fay . . .  Fay.
Fay, I want us to be friends. And friends don't hit each other, 'less they have to.  So whatta you say we start all over and you tell me exactly what the fuck is goin' on?
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -- this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven-hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer --
Harry, look at me.
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
For a movie?
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my Driving Miss Daisy.
What's it called?
Mr. Lovejoy.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's the title?
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
Who's the star?
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in The Cyclone.
One of his best parts.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
Ride the Clouds. Good picture.
She looks familiar.
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelette; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
So what's the problem?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
He drown?
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin --
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
Just a thought.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
You don't even know these guys.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
Let's see how we get along.
That's us.
Don't say nothing to me. Sit down and act like you're waiting for somebody supposed to meet you.
The fock you taking about . . .
They nobody know me here, man. Give me the focking money.
Sit down. Now be looking. Man over to your right in the blue wool shirt hanging out . . . the other way, derecho . . .
That's a federal officer, most likely DEA. He moves his leg look for the bulge. You savvy bulge? That's his backup piece . . . Hey. Try it without looking right at him if you can.
What's your name?
 Yayo. Portillo.
Alright, Yayo, you know he's there, now forget about him. Now I'm gonna get up. Soon as I'm gone, you sit down in this same seat I'm in. You feel something under your ass it's the key to a locker where your half a million is. Along with some product we're returning
You suppose to give me the focking money yourself.
Try to be cool Yahoo. I told you where it is. Do it how I told you and have a safe trip home. Or as you all say, vaya con Dios, motherfucker.
Like fucking clockwork, eh Bear?
Don't cuss in front of Farrah.
Hi, Bo.
How you doing, sweetie?
Here we go!
I once asked this literary agent what type of writing brought the most money and the agent says, 'Ransom notes.'
Here it is . . . Mr. Lovejoy.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action . . .  What's he doing? Following a guy?
Read it. It's a grabber.
Hey, Harry? I think your investors are here.
Jesus . . .
All right, Harry, make sure the limo guys sit here, not over on the sofa.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk . . . but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am.
In the year 2525 . . . if man is still alive . . .
So what do I say to them?
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
You're kidding, right?
If woman can survive . . .
You tell 'em the movie's been postponed. Say, till next year, if you want. But don't tell 'em why or what you're doing. Understand, Harry? You don't tell 'em anything about Mr. Lovejoy.
They may find . . .
Harry, what year is it, man? We enter a time warp? I feel like I'm back in Hollywood of yesteryear.
Have a seat . . . right over here . . .
This is my associate, Chili Palmer, who'll be working with me.
I want to make sure there's no misunderstanding here. Despite rumors you might have heard, your investment in Freaks is as sound as the day you signed your participation agreement.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
 What I been wondering is where's he been.
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
I've been off scouting locations. Interviewing actors in New York.
The main thing I want to tell you, the start date for Freaks is being pushed back a little, a few months.
A few months?
Maybe longer. We need prep time.
Hey, Harry? Bullshit. We have an agreement with you, man.
We're gonna make the picture. I've just got another project to do first, that's all. One I promised this guy years ago.
I want to see your books, Harry. Show me where it is, a two with five zeroes after it in black and white, man. I want to see your books and your bank statements.
Hey, Ronnie? Look at me.
You have a piece of a movie, that's all. You don't have a piece of Harry. He told you we're doing another movie first. And that's the way it's gonna be.
Excuse me. But who the fuck are you?
I'm the one telling you how it is. That's not too hard to figure out, is it?
Cat?
What's this movie you're doing first?
Harry, let me answer that.
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
 You can talk to me.
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way
This is the project, Mr. Lovejoy. I'm not trying to pull anything on you guys. This is it, right here.
Mr. Loveboy? What is it, Harry, a porno flick?
It's nothing. It's fluff. Nothing you'd be interested in.
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of Freaks and put 'em in this other one, Mr. Loverboy.
I can't do it.
You positive about that?
It's a different kind of deal.
Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
You hear me?
Take your time, Harry.  We're not animals. Are we, Ronnie?
What?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought . . . I told you to keep your mouth shut.
I had to tell 'em something.
Never say anything unless you have to.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
His shrink's trainer.
Take me back to my car.
Where you been? I been callin' all over for you . . .
 Ray Bones is looking for you. He's got some kinda bug up his ass, can't sit still.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
He already knew it.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I'm thinking about producing.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
. . . call me soon as you know when Ray's coming out.
Hey . . . Karen. How ya' doin'?
What're you doing here?
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
No, no . . . you let the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Rough day on the set?
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons --
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
 . . . That's what we finally decided.
Like in Bride of the Mutant, when you played the whole end with that torn top.
You saw that one?
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished . . . when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in Mildred Pierce -- which by the way was a better book than a movie -- did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
 Yeah . . . that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
For any movie.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Man, can you scream.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, Cabin in the . . .
Cotton.
Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but . . .'
'I just washed my hair.'
Yeah.
That is a great line.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
I married Martin. That was a full-time job.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
He must mean after Slime Creature 3.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million-dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Don't go out of your way.
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
Right. See how your story ends.
Yeah. Right.  Listen, Touch of Evil's phying near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
Maybe some other time.
'He tried to make love to me and I shot him.'  Another great Bette Davis line.
See you around.
Evening, sir.
And a good evening to you, too, sir.
Look at me, Leo.
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
They report it to the IRS.
You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
You've been losing.
I'm up twelve grand today.
From when? You left Vegas with four-fifty?
Who told you that?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
How'd you know I was here?
Here's another tip
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
How? By taking my money?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
It's all mine.
Sit down, Leo.
I don't know how you got this far, you're so fuckin' dumb. But now you're through. I'm gonna explain to you why and I hope you're not too dumb to understand what I'm saying. Okay?
Ray Bones is now the man you're dealing with. Ray Bones finds out what you did, he's gonna want everything you have. And when I say everything, I mean even that sporty little hat if he wants it. Then after he takes all you got, he'll most likely hit you with some kind of heavy object if he doesn't shoot you, just so you won't tell on him.
I won't do that. Take your stuff or hurt you. You have three-ten in the case, right? I'm gonna take the three hundred you scammed off the airline, but the rest of it, the ten grand? I'm gonna borrow that and pay you back sometime.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
I'll find you, Leo . . .
You leave a trail like a fuckin' caterpillar.
Wait a minute. What's this eighteen-percent-a-year shit? You want to borrow ten, the vig's three bills a week. Fifteen for the vig plus the ten, that's twenty-five big ones you go a whole year, buddy! You hear me?
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Hey, Harry.
Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!
Harry. I'm gonna boom down real fast, get a subjective p-o-v.
Listen, I talked to Karen. She's gonna think about helping you out.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on . . . right now . . .  She's gonna talk to Martin?
She's thinking about it. I just need the key to your office. I just told her I'd pick up a script.
It's the red one. Take it off the ring.
Your name Vicky Vespa?
Excuse me?
I asked you, is your name Vicky Vespa?
No.
Then get the fuck outta my chair.
 What're you doing? I thought I told you to get down here?
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
What 'emotion?' Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
She's scared! Fear is an emotion!  Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Pick 'n' Save.
Hm?
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
Now I'm gonna tell you a little story, happened to me years ago when I was so broke I had to go to the Pick 'n' Save over on Vine to buy a lousy candybar for my dinner.
I'm standing in line waiting to pay my two bits when I overhear this lady, call her Mildred, talking to the cashier about a movie.
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so . . . romantic.'
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
So . . . keep this fuckin' camera down here on the ground and shoot this scene, so we can see what the fuck is goin' on, before I get someone over sixteen to fuckin' shoot it for you!
Here's your keys, Harry.
Get the fuck outta my chair.
This ain't bad, you know it? This Mr. Lovejoy. Needs a better ending but yeah, I can see why Harry wants to do it.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
That's right, me.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I put a gun right here . . .  . . . and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie Fingers.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.  So whatta you think of the script?
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than Lovejoy.
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
There's Ilona.
What about her?
Get something going there.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
She's . . . young.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
Who?
She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
You know what I'm thinkin'?  You wanna make the girl older. I don't like the ending. We could do that, you and me, sit down and write the script over where it needs it.
You know how to write one of these?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words . . . although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
That's all there is to it, huh?
That's all.
Then what do I need you for?
I really think I can be of service on this one.
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
He was some kind of man.
What does it matter what you say about people?
Good-bye, Tanya.
Adios.
Wow, huh?
You been here the whole time?
I just caught the end.
You know, Welles didn't even wanna do that one. Some studio made him do it. He owed 'em one and all his own movies lost money.  But, hey, sometimes that's when you do your best work, you got a gun to your head . . .
I got you a copy of the script.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
What do you think?
I think it's not horrible.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Then you've read it?
Not yet.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
There a part in it for you?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
Sounds fair.
What do you get out of it?
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
I want to know.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
And you think the movie business is any different?
Yeah well . . . I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
I'm talking to Martin tomorrow morning. I told Harry I'd meet you and him at Abiquiu afterward.  This might work, you never know.
Who is it?
Me.
 Fuck.
I heard that.
Hello, Doris.
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
Come on in.
What a spectacular view.
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camero down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
I miss Murray, Harry.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
Yeah, well, twenty-twenty hindsight and all that.
I hate being alone. The house is so quiet. So lonely. It needs . . .  A man's touch.
Nice garter.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
 You seem to feel fine about it.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
Murray's dead.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day . . . who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
How honorable of you.
Harry. If you want me to go, just say the word.
What the hell . . .
Listen to me, man, I don't wan' no focking key. I wan' the money.
Hey, Yayo? You gonna smoke, get the hell off my seventy-bucks-a-yard carpet.
I told you where the money is. All you gotta do is go get it.
No. I'll tell you something
That's all you know, huh? Wait here a minute, Yayo, I be back directly.
The fock you doing with that?
I'm taking you out, Yahoo.
Dead focking center, man.
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
You see that? The way the man just went right over?
Maybe we can get Chili Palmer up here. You fix my railing to give way like they do in the movies. Then I invite the man out here, have a look at my view. Get him to lean over the railing, see all the naked people down there . . . a tragic accident, officer . . .
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
I mean, what's the point of living in L.A. if you're not in the movie business?
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset . . .
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
See, here it is . . . Martin Weir's house . . . right across the steet from George Hamilton.
Chili, Jesus!
It is you . . .
Nicole?
It's Nicki now. I don't believe this.
Me neither.  We know each other.
'How 'bout that.' Then looks at Nicki.
Hello, Nicki.
Karen. Shit. I didn't see you there. How are you?
Martin will be out in a minute.  Chili was the only one at Momo's didn't hit on me.
What a gentleman.
You like my hair?  Black like this?
It's nice. Especially under your arms.
Martin won't let me shave. I guess I fill some need. Brings him back to the sixties or something.
 Speak of the devil . . .
Karen. Wow. Look at you . . .
Hello, Martin.
Mmmmm. You smell terrific.  She always smelled so good.
 Neat.  Martin, this is Chili Palmer.
Chili is it?
Yesh, a pleasure, Martin.
Chili's a gangster. Ran a club I used to play at for another gangster back in Miami. How is Momo these days anyway?
Dead.
Bummer.  Well, I'll let you all get to your movie talk. Chili, make sure you say good-bye before you leave.
A PORTRAIT OF MARTIN WEIR
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
Really.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all . . . slip away?
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did . . . when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
Yeah. That was a good party.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
We talk different?
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
Okay, I'm one of those guys you mentioned. I'm actually one of 'em. What am I thinking?
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying an actual metamorphosis takes place. That wouldn't be acting.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
So you want to know.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One of mine?
One we're producing.
With what? Wiseguy money?
Maybe this was a bad idea.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loan-shark Operation in Miami.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
You're an actor, you like to pretend. Imagine you're the shylock. A guy owes you fifteen grand and he skips, leaves town. What do you do?
Oh, for Christ's sake --
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
Martin, look at me.
I'm looking at you.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
Like this?
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
Wait. How about this?
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
Look at me. I'm thinking, You're mine. I fuckin' own you. What I'm not doing is feeling anything about it one way or the other. You understand? You're not a person to me, you're a name in my collection book, a guy owes me money, that's all.
How about this?
That's not bad.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
I believe it.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
How do I know that?
The guy's wife tells you . . .
Harry, how you doing?
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people --
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
I'm working on a few things.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
Chili Palmer told me.
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
Okay. I'm listening.
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it . . . a lot.
Refresh my memory . . .
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
You serious?
All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Buddy?
Lufkin. His . . . agent.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
But you are interested?
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey --  This your ride, Chili?
Very nice . . .
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
What's that?
Compass.
Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
Leo, I don't know.
I bet he did and he ain't givin' you a penny of it, help you out. Not the way I am.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
The airport.
It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
I don't know.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
That's why I was thinking you could send your boy Chili Palmer. He gets busted or hit on the head you aren't out nothing.
C-18.
That's the magic number.
Cat . . .
Wait here.
I'd like you to meet my associate, the Bear. Movie stuntman and champion weightlifter, as you might've noticed. Picks up and throws out things I don't want.
We think you ought to turn around and go back to Miami.
So you're a stuntman. Are you any good?
Not bad for a guy his size.
I'll make you a deal. If you can get out of here before I take my coat off, I won't clean the floor with you, get your little costume all messed up.
You don't know me. You only think you do.
Rough business this movie business. I may have to go back to loan sharking for a rest.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
Oh, is that right? I'm being set up? Then how come Catlett said I should send you out to get it, since you haven't done a fucking thing for me since you got into this . . . except showing Bo Catlett my script?
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
'We?'
Chili and me.
Really.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
A meeting with who? You and Karen?
Harry --
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
I found him.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
You have it?
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Who?
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names . . .
Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money . . .
I wouldn't get my hopes up, Harry.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Bones. B-O-N-E-S.
 I show a 'Dem Bones Barbecue' in Dade County, but that's all.
Oh. Wait a minute. That's not his real name. It's uh . . . uh . . . yeah -- try Barboni. B-a-r-b-o-n-i.
Fuck.
Fuck fuck fuck fuck . . .
What?
Ray Barboni?
Who is this?
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Depends. Who's this?
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
What three hundred grand?
The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
Hello? You there?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Okay. So who are you?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Who?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Never heard of him.
Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm.
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is . . . or else.
Or else what?
Or else use your fucking imagination.
Motherfucker.
A ROW OF LOCKERS
You want to make five bucks, take you two minutes?
You go over to those lockers over there and put this in C-17.
It's a surprise for my wife. But you have to do it quick, okay? While she's in the can.
Yeah, okay.
Thanks.
Excuse me, sir . . .
Curtis. Drug Enforcement. These are Agents Dunbar and Morgan, would you come with us, please?
What's wrong? What's this about?
Let's follow him and behave ourselves. What do you say?
Mr. Barbone? Welcome to L.A. I'm Bobby, your driver. You have a good flight?
 I hope you drive better than you fucking spell, jackoff. My name's Barboni, not Bar-bone.
You want to go to the hotel first, Mr. Escobar?
I want to get my focking money.
You live in Miami?
That's right.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm in the movie business.
You're an investor, is that it?
I'm a producer.
You have a card in here?
Not yet. I just started.
I'd appreciate your telling me what this is about.
I got a John Doe warrant here. I can strip-search you if I want.
Pat him down.
Why don't I strip-search him.
Pat him down.
Spread your legs.
What're you doing at the airport?
I was supposed to meet my wife, but she wasn't on the flight.
Why, you live in Miami, was your wife coming from Newark?
We had a fight and she left me, went back to Brooklyn. I asked her to come out here, you know, thinking with a change of scenery maybe we could get back together, and she said okay, but evidently she changed her mind.
Your wife a Lakers fan?
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
You can go.
By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
It was C . . . I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Something shouldn't be there.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Get him out've here.
You ever wanta go to the beach, here's the freeway you take we're coming to.
I live in Miami and you want to show me a fuckin' beach? The sun ever come out here, or you have this smog all the time?
They say the smog's the reason we have such beautiful sunsets.
That's what they say, huh? What a buncha fuckin' bullshit.
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
So you didn't have the key with you.
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
You spotted them, huh?
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
I have to ask you for that key.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
Lie down on your back. Come on, if you want to breathe.
Take deep breaths through your mouth and let it out slow . . . that's it, like that.
Hey, Bear, look at me.
Tell your boss I don't ever want to see him again. He made a deal with Harry and a deal's a deal.
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
Not too bad.
How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
So . . . how many movies you been in?
About sixty.
No shit? What're some of 'em?
Harry Zimm?
What -- who is it . . . ?
The dipshit who's never been out've Miami.
Mr. Barboni. Well. This is surprise . . .
Please. Have a seat. Right here in this chair right here . . .
They say the fuckin' smog's the reason you have such beautiful sunsets.
Whatta you mean, he faked them out?
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
So where's the money?
I guess still in the locker.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
I mean I don't care.
Bear, I'm going to call you later.
Mr. Escobar. What a surprise. Welcome to L.A.
Where is my nephew?
Your who?
Yayo. Where is he?
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
You gave him the money?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
 A zillion, huh? That's a lot.
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
He's around someplace.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
Oh, yeah, and Yayo, too.
His fucking nephew?
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
I'm talking about you, Ray Barboni, owning a piece of a major motion picture. How big a piece is up to you. What I'm saying, you could invest part of the three hundred Palmer owes you or you could invest all of it. It's entirely up to you . . .
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
Ray. Look at me.
What?
Look at me, Ray.
You say look at you?
That's correct. Look at me.
I tell you what . . .
Fuckin look at that, asshole . . .
And have a peek at that . . .
You know, Harry, this is the exact fucking thing I needed after the fucking plane flight. My ass fell asleep . . .  . . . seven times. I need a little fucking . . .  . . . exercise.
You got a big problem, Harry.
Hey, Harry . . . Harry. Don't you pass out on me. Look up here . . .
Where's my money?
Harry. I'm gonna ask you one more time, then I'm gonna shoot you, you don't tell me what I wanna know . . .
Where's my money?
Your money?
Who the fuck are you?
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
He owes me money.
Get in line, bro.
I don't like waiting.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
Yeah, well, I just closed it.
You a quick draw . . . 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
Whatta you got there . . . some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
Don't you puke on my shoes, Harry.
Harry. I need you to do me a favor . . .
I need you to take this gun and put a pill in the bro over there for me.
I know what you're thinking, 'Why the fuck would I shoot him? He's already dead.'
But see, the cops got these tests, tell them whether or not a person fired a gun. And I was never here.
You understand, Harry? I was never here. You say I was, and I'm gonna come back here throw you out that fuckin' window.
C'mon, knock it off, Harry. We don't have a lotta time here . . .
Not a worry in the world.
Your pool needs skimming.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
Depends, who pays?
Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Oh, I like him. I just think he's . . . short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
Yeah?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Really.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
You thought I was faking?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Oh.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute --
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
I'm not in right now. Leave a message at the beep . . .
Hi, Karen. It's Doris. Listen, doll, you might wanna come by Cedars tonight and visit Harry. He's in the emergency room . . .
I stopped by his office to see if he wanted to take me to Le Dome for dinner when I saw Harry and this other man lying on the floor.
Goodnight, Todd. Night, Louis.
Harry . . . My God . . .
What happened?
He can't talk. He's full of Demerol.
Who'd he shoot?
According to Todd -- Sergeant Randall -- a man named Ronnie came by Harry's office to collect on a debt. He got rough and Harry shot him.
You shot one of the limo guys?
Hello, hello . . .
 Okay . . . here we go. Looks like Mr. Zimm here's got a broken jaw and some neck trauma to go with those fractured hands . . .
Excuse me, folks . . .
Hey, Harry, listen, Martin wanted to meet us tomorrow at the Ivy for lunch. I'd cancel, but Martin's going to Cannes next week, so I think maybe Chili and I should still go.
Okay, who wants to take a crack at wiring Mr. Zimm's jaw?
Motherfucker . . .
Motherfucker . . .
Hey, Bear. I been calling you, man. Where you been?
Hi Bo.
Hey, Farrah. Hah you, little honey bunny. You wipe your feet, for you come in here? Keep Uncle Bo's carpet nice and white.
You see the paper?
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie . . .
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Who?
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Whoa . . . This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
Come here, honey bunny, come sit with your Uncle Bo. He hates being alone.
Fact, he hates it so much, if he takes a fall, he ain't gonna fall by himself.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
Come here, Farrah . . .
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
Farrah. Come here.
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
What about him?
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
 And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
Sunset Marquis.
This is Mr. Palmer. I have any messages.
 A Tommy Carlo called. He said to tell you that a Mr. Barboni was on his way to Los Angeles and that you should . . .  . . . get the fuck out of there.
When was this?
Two nights ago.
Wow. Nice earrings.
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Why not?
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
. . . my project . . .
Mr. Zimm. Nice to see you.
Right this way.
You're a celebrity, Harry. You shoulda shot someone a long time ago.
Tell me, Harry, what'd you think of Ray Bones as a person?
Only a guy like Bones would mess you up like this, break your hands for no reason. He shoot Ronnie, too?
Thing I don't get, Harry, is why'd you go and do a thing like talking to Ray Bones. You don't need guys like him or Bo Catlett.
I been here a while now and far as I can tell you're the only person in town actually making a movie instead of just talking about it.
Chill. Harry.
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
Thanks.
Would you guys mind terribly not smoking?
So. Harry. I hear you had quite an experience.
Well, I'm glad you're okay. And you know what else?
I'm glad you rejected me ten years ago when I auditioned for Eddie Solomon, the pedophile clown in Birthday Boy. Had I gotten the part. I might've gotten typecast.
You all ready to order? I kind've have another thing after this . . .
You know, I feel like an omelette. You think I could have a cheese omelette with shallots, but with the shallots only slightly browned . . .
I think the romance angle in your story is critically important, that isn't simply a jump in the sack for either of them. These two become deeply in love.
Which two?
 Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
Mob guy?
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
And after all, you have such morals.
Mob guy?
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
What money?
 The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Shylock?
Look at me, Harry.
Whatta you think, Chill?
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
Really, it scares me how well I know him. I could do this one tomorrow, no further preparation.  Bye darlin' . . . you really should think about acting again. I mean, maybe we could even do something together.
I'll give it some heavy thought.
Chili. Wake up.
Wake up. Someone's downstairs.
It's Harry. Downstairs.
You sure?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
 You're as bad as Harry . . .
I'll go. I'll go.
Hey, Karen, you have a gun? Any kind would be fine.
I think it's Rio Bravo.
I need the money.
What money?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
Give it to me, I'll be on my way.
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
Tell you what . . .
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One . . .
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two . . .
I don't believe this.
Three.
Karen? You okay?
She can't talk right now.
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money . . . but it's not here. I have to go get it.
Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping.
You know Laurel Canyon?
I'll find it.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
 Gimme an hour.
You get the money?
No. What's this?
Plan B. Here ya go, honey . . .
Make yourself comfortable.
We gonna make a little trade.
For Christ sake . . .
Trade for what?
The money. Fuck. I gotta think . . .
Jesus, Bo, what're you doing?
He doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.
Shut up.
So you kidnapped her?
That's a fucking federal offense, asshole!
Shut up!
You get life for kidnapping.
Calm down, Bear . . .
Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
 Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
So this's one of those houses you see way up hanging over the cliff.
Where's Karen?
 In the can. That the money?
Lemme see her.
You okay?
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
She's great. Gimme the money.
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
I've been shot at before -- once by accident, twice on purpose. I'm still here and I'm gonna be here as long as I want. That means you're gonna have to be somewhere else, not anywhere near me or Harry or Karen.
Here's your money. Take it and leave the movie business to the rest of us, know what we're doing. C'mon Karen . . .
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
What?
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
Bear, you're not really gonna --
That's for the stairs.
Ever fallen down stairs before? It really hurts . . .
Hey --
You wanna go first, honey? That's fine with me.
Get him off my carpet, you gonna make him bleed like that.
Like I say, 'I warned him, officer, but he kept coming at me . . .'
And that's for the airport.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
We'll get it later.
Okay, Bear . . . that's enongh.
Hey, Bear . . . enough!
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
You're right.
Fuck . . .
Hey --
Chili!
C'mon, man, gimme your hand . . . we gotta get outta here . . .
Hey, Karen, don't --
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
Oh, shit . . . I'm sorry . . . I thought that was . . . I'm so sorry . . .
Jesus. How'd that happen?
Beats the shit out of me.
Were you scared up there?
You bet.
You don't act like it?
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
I'll be right back.
 Go get your stuff.
You don't need that. You want to sit down and talk, it's fine with me. Get this straightened out.
How'd you get in here?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
You're the dumbest fucking guy I ever met in my life. Let's see what's in your pockets.
What you should've done was told me about Leo Devoe as soon as you found out.
Why would I do that?
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
What have we here?
Give me my cigarettes. They're in the inside pocket.
Help yourself.
C-one-eight.
I wonder what this's for, a locker? Yeah, but where is it?
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
Yeah? Which terminal?
 Sovereign.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
I like it here.
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -- I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -- forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
Whatever you want, Ray.
Drug Enforcement Agency.
I wanna speak to the agent in charge.
 What is this in regard to?
A locker out at the airport, full of money.
 Who's speaking please?
I can't tell you. It's an anonymous call.
 Are you the same anonymous asshole called the other day?
No, this is a different one. Have you looked in that locker, C-one-eight?
You're helping us out. I'd like to know who this is.
I bet you would. You want to chat or you want me to tell you who to look for? The guy's on his way out there right now.
You know there's a reward for information that leads to a conviction. That's why I have to know who this is.
I'll get my reward in heaven. The guy you want has a bullet scar in his head and is wearing gray shoes. You can't miss him.
What took you so long?
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
Look at me, Boots.
Watch it, Steve!
Dammit . . . not again . . .
Cut!
Martin, maybe you should dive or roll out of the way or something . . .
Alright, let's wrap! We'll pick it up tomorrow!
But Martin already told me he loves it.
Look, I don't know, Buddy, I don't think Martin's right for this new one.
Why the hell not?
He's too short.
