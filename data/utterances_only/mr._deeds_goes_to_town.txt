Say listen, Corny, who do you think you're talking to? If the Semple attorneys don't know who the heir is, who does?  Aw, come on Corny, I've done you a lot of favors. What do you say - who's getting the Semple dough?
 You're asking the wrong guy, Mac. I'm only a press agent.
Newspaperman?
 Wants to know who the heir is.
 Hang up.
 Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
 Hang up.
 Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
 I'm not interested in the newspapers.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
 It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
We located him, Mr. Cedar! We found out where he is.
Good!
Yes, John, we got him.
Here's the report: Longfellow Deeds, single, 28, lives in Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
 Thank heaven.
Better wire him right away, John.
I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.
Yes?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
 Where?
Mandrake Falls. (begins to spell as scene fades) M-A-N
Welcome to Mandrake Falls -Where the scenery enthralls -Where no hardship e'er befalls - Welcome to Mandrake Falls.
That's pretty.
Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
Yes sir, Mr. Cedar. This is the town all right.
Well, I dropped everything at the office - I hope it's not a wild goose chase.
No, sir. We checked it thoroughly. He lives here all right.
Ah! I spy a native. Let's ask him.
 Good morning.
 Morning, neighbors. Morning.
That's an excellent start. At least we've broken the ice.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Deeds?
Yes.
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Yes, I
Must be a game he's playing.
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Who's that?
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
Morning, neighbors.
Remember us? We're the fellows who were here a minute ago.
Oh, yes. Yes, indeedy. I never forget a face.
Listen, Pop, we've come all the way from New York to look up a fellow by the name of Deeds. It's important - very important!
 You don't have to get rough, neighbor. All you got to do is ask.
Then please pretend, for just one fleeting moment, that I'm asking. Where does he reside?
Who?
Longfellow Deeds - where does he live?
Oh, that's what you want! Well, why didn't you say so in the first place instead of beating around the bush? Those other fellows don't know what they're talking about.  Come on, I'll take you there in my car. If they'd only explained to me what they wanted, there would be no trouble.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Is Mr. Deeds in?
No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine.  Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.
Knew it all the time. But these men said they wanted to see the house. (mumbling as he exits) Can't read their minds if they don't say what they want.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
No, thanks.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
 He writes poetry?
Oh, my goodness, yes. Longfellow's famous. He writes all those things on postcards. You know, for Christmas - and Easter - and birthdays. Sit down, please.
Here's one - he got $25 for this one.
"When you've nowhere to turn - and you're filled with doubt - Don't stand in midstream, hesitating, For you know that your mother's heart cries out - 'I'm waiting, my boy, I'm waiting.'"  Isn't that beautiful?
Isn't it a lovely sentiment?
 Yeah.
 Here he is now.
 I suggest you break it to him gently. He's liable to keel over from the shock.
They've been waiting a long while.
Who are they?
I don't know.
 Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
How do you do.
 How do you do.
 I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
 Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.  Budington must feel like an awful stranger, hmm?
Mr. Cornelius Cobb and Mr. Anderson.
You gentlemen make yourselves comfortable.
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
 I'd like to ask you a few questions.
All right.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Yes.
Are your parents living?
Why, no.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to
I have good news for you, sir. Mr. Semple left a large fortune when he died. He left it all to you, Mr. Deeds. Deducting the taxes, it amounts to something in the neighborhood of $20,000,000.
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
 Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
 Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
Buffer?
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Why should you?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Nah.
I've got one for Cobb
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Huh?
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Who - me? No.
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
Don't pay any attention to her.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Now you keep out of this!
 Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
What for?
You're going to New York with us.
When?
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
 I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
See you later, kid.
 Good day, sir.
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
 I can't find him.
You can't?
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
He probably had a change of heart.
He wasn't very anxious to come in the first place.
 Here comes the train.
Look!
What?
That tuba player!
Well, now I've seen everything.
Goodbye, Mrs. Meredith!  Goodbye, Jim! Bye, Buddy! Goodbye, everybody!  Gosh, I've got a lot of friends.
 Have a drink?
 No, thanks.
Will you have a cigar?
No, thank you.
 I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
No?
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
 Hello, John. Where have you been?
 I've been fishing.
 Good morning, Celia.
Good morning, Mr. Cedar.
Good morning. Where are they?
Waiting for you in the other office.
 Good morning. Hello, boys.
 Hello, John.
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
John
Close that door.  Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
Come on, John. What happened?
 The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
 John, did you get the - uh
 No, Budington, I didn't get the Power of Attorney. But don't worry, I will. (beaming to his brothers) I asked him last night what he was going to do with the money, and what do you suppose he said?
He said he guessed he'd give it away.
John, if you don't mind my saying so - we can't afford to
 I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
 But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get
 Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again! (pause - change of tone) I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.
A yokel! Nothing but a yokel! Your uncle must have been mad to leave all that money to him! You're as closely related to him as he is, and what did you get?
 I say, what did you get?
Stop yelling. Can I help it if my uncle didn't like me?
I told you to be nice to him. Ten years we've been waiting for that old man to kick off. And then we were going to be on Easy Street. Yeah - on Easy Street!
Oh, shut up! It's too late now, and you're a nuisance!
That's just what I'm going to be - a nuisance. I'm going to be a nuisance until I get hold of some of that money!
 He's news!  Every time he blows his nose, it's news. A corn-fed bohunk like that falling into the Semple fortune is hot copy . . . But it's got to be personal. It's got to have an angle. What does he think about?  How does it feel to be a millionaire! Is he going to get married!  What does he think of New York! Is he smart? Is he dumb? . . . A million angles!
He's been here three days, and what have you numbskulls brought in! Any halfwit novice could have done better!
Yeah, we tried too
Am I talking too loud? Or annoying anybody?
You know Corny Cobb. He's keeping him under lock and key.
Cobb, Cobb! Never mind about Cobb. Use what little brains you've got! Find out something yourselves, you imbecilic stupes!  Now get out of here before I really tell you what I think of you. Come on, get out!
EMPTY_LINE
 What was that?
 Huh? I said you had dirty plaster.
You too! Thought I could depend on you, but you're getting as bad as the rest of them.
 Look, I can do it!
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
 Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have
Can I have a month's vacation?
With pay!
With pay!
Uh-huh.
 Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
 Have lunch.
It's the first time I ever had a suit made on purpose.
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Yes. That is to say
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
 Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
 Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
 I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is. (reaches into his pocket and reads) "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
Huh?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
I'll give it a lot of thought. There was a fellow named Winslow here a little while ago, wanted to handle my affairs for nothing too. It puzzles me why these people all want to work for nothing. It isn't natural. So I guess I'd better think about it some more.
That's that.
You go to an awful lot of work to keep a fellow warm, don't you?
Yes, sir.
A Mr. Hallor to see you sir.
 Did you say Hallor?
Yes, sir.
Well, don't let him in.
Why not? Who is he?
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  Send him in.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
I thought I told you to take up this matter with me, Hallor.
I'm a little tired of being pushed around by you, Mr. Cedar - I don't care how important you are.  Mr. Deeds, I represent Mrs. Semple.
 Mrs. Semple?
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
We'll let the courts decide what her legal position is.
You wouldn't dare go into court with a case like this - and you know it!
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
A child? My uncle's?
Yes, sir.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
 I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
Don't make any rash promises
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
 Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
 You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
Uh-huh.
That's funny. Why is that?
 Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
From what I'm led to believe, the young man's quite childish. I don't think we'll have any difficulty in getting him to put up the entire amount. After all, it's only a matter of $180,000.
 You know, gentlemen, we're really very fortunate the young man is so sympathetic toward music.  He plays the tuba in the town band.
 Here he comes.
Good.
Now, gentlemen, the first order of business will be the election of a new Chairman of the Board.
 As a sentimental gesture toward the best friend opera ever had, the late Mr. Semple, I think it only fitting that his nephew, Mr. Longfellow Deeds, should be made our next Chairman. I therefore nominate him.
Second.
All those in favor . . .
Aye.
Carried.  My congratulations, Mr. Deeds.
 I'm Chairman?
 Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
 I'm Chairman.
 Happy voyage.
Right here, Mr. Deeds.
Now, the next order of business is the reading of the Secretary's minutes . . .
Move we dispense with it.
Second.
All in favor?
I think they can be dispensed with. We're ready now for the reading of the Treasurer's report.
Move we dispense with it.
Second.
All in favor?
Quite right! Now, gentlemen, the next business will be
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it.
The treasurer reports a deficit of $180,000 for the current year.
A deficit! You mean we've lost that much?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Why, it's an artistic institution
We own an opera house, don't we?
We do.
And we give shows?
We provide opera.
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
Of course.
And it doesn't pay?
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
 Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Me?!
Naturally.
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
Hey, a fire engine!
 Gee, that was a pip![4] (as he goes back to his seat) We expect we're going to have one like that in Mandrake Falls pretty soon  with a siren, too.
Now, where were we?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Why not?
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000. If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you charge too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of things. I don't know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that money. And I can't afford to put it into anything that I don't look into. That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and thank you for making me Chairman.
Gentlemen, you'll find the smelling salts in the medicine chest.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
No, I mean - about my client.
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
Tails tonight, sir?
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Yes, sir.
 Goodbye, and thank you sir.
Goodbye. (turning to the others) Wants me to wear a monkey suit.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
Huh?
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Oh. That.
What do you think you're doing?
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
 Yes, sir.
 Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
 And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
No, sir.
 Excuse me. What did you say?
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
 Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.
If there's any talk of settlement, Hallor, take it up with me at the office.
I'll do no such thing
That's right. Don't you go to his office. There's only one place you're going, and that's out the door.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Now wait a minute, buddy
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Yes, sir.
And listen, there isn't any wife - there aren't any letters - and I think you're a crook. So you better watch your step.
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Only common sense.
 I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
Even his hands are oily.
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Entertainment?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
What're you talking about?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Oh.
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Okay, you're the boss.  When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
Hey, you going out?
Why yes. Isn't that all right?
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
Who are you?
We're your bodyguards.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
Sorry, mister. Orders is orders.
Is that so?
Yes, sir. We gotta get you up in the morning - and we gotta put you to bed at night.
Only it's all right. No matter what we see - we don't see nuttin', see?
 That's going to be fun.
Some people like it.
Uh, will you do something for me before we go out?
Sure!
 Put that away, slug!  At your service!
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Certainly.
With pleasure.
 Hey, hey! We're your bodyguards. You can't do this!
 There he is. Yep, that's him.
That's who?
Get the cameras ready and follow me.
What are you going to do?
Never mind. Follow me and grab whatever you can get.
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Right.
You fainted.
 Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
Can I help you?
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
What happened?
Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.  You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.
 Hey, taxi!
 Hey, stupe! Follow that cab they just got into, will you? Hurry up! Step on it!
Come on, come on!
Hurry up!
Feel better now?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Tell me more about yourself.
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
 Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
 What?
Oh - uh - nothing.
Waiter! Has anybody come in yet?
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Uh-huh.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Uh-huh.
I write poetry.
Uh-huh.
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
No. That is, I didn't (pause - while he looks at her) Until I met you. I like talking to you, though  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
Brookfield just came in.
Oh, the poet? Where?
Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.
 Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
 Really?
 Pardon. Longfellow Deeds, who just inherited the Semple fortune, wants to meet you.
Oh, yes. I read about him. He writes poetry on postcards.
Let's invite him over. Might get a couple of laughs. Getting rather dull around here.
It's always dull here.
 I'll get him.
Good.
Henaberry, Mr. Morrow, Bill - this is Mr. Deeds and his fiance from Mandrake Falls.
 How do! Hello! Nice to meet you!
Nice of you to ask us to come and sit with you. Back home we never get a chance to meet famous people.
 Waiter! A little service here.
 Yes! Mr. Deeds is a distinguished poet. A drink for Mr. Deeds!
He's a poet. Have a drink.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Tell us, Mr. Deeds. How do you go about writing your poems? We craftsmen are very interested in one another's methods.
Yes. Do you have to wait for an inspiration, or do you just dash it off?
 Well, I don't know. I
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
Yes. That's what my publishers have been complaining about.
 Your readers don't complain, Mr. Morrow.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
How about you, Mr. Deeds?
Well, I write mine on order. The people I work for just tell me what they want and then I go to work and write it.
Amazing! Why, that's true genius!
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Well, I play the tuba.
I've been playing the harmonica for forty years - didn't do me a bit of good.
You wouldn't have one in your pocket, would you, Mr. Deeds?
 What? A tuba?
No, a postcard - with one of your poems on it.
 No.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Too bad! I was hoping you'd autograph one for me.
I was too.
Quite right.
Wait a minute, boys. Perhaps Mr. Deeds would recite one for us.
 Yes!
That's a very good idea. Nothing like a poet reciting his own stuff.
Exactly! Give us one that wrings the great American heart.
 Yes.
 I guess I get the idea. I guess I know why I was invited here. To make fun of me.
 Oh, come now. I wouldn't say that.
Look, he's temperamental.
 Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
 It's easy to make fun of somebody if you don't care how much you hurt 'em.  I think your poems are swell, Mr. Brookfield, but I'm disappointed in you. I know I must look funny to you, but maybe if you went to Mandrake Falls you'd look just as funny to us . Only nobody would laugh at you and make you feel ridiculous - 'cause that wouldn't be good manners.
I guess maybe it is comical to write poems for postcards, but a lot of people think they're good. Anyway, it's the best I can do. So if you'll excuse me, we'll be leaving. I guess I found out that all famous people - aren't big people . . .
 There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
 Oh, I don't mind.
Then I guess maybe I will.
 Manager!
 Eureka!
Step aside, step aside!
 Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
The difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news- stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw!
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet (Longfellow catches him before he falls backward in his enthusiasm) thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
 Binge?
Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
 That ought to be fun.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
 Oh, Tempora! Oh, Moeraes! Oh, Bacchus![8] He bumps into a woman, who glares at him.
Oh, you're drunk.
 Oh, you're right.
 I guess if we go with him, we'll see things, huh?
Yes, I guess we will.
 "'I play the tuba to help me think.' This is one of the many startling statements made by Longfellow Deeds - New York's new Cinderella Man - who went out last night to prove that his uncle, the late M.W. Semple - from whom he inherited $20,000,000 - was a rank amateur in the art of 'standing the town on its cauliflower ear' . . . "
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Did it?
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Is he really that big a sap?
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
How'd you get the picture?
Had the boys follow us.
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
When're you going to see him again?
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
 You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
 Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
 Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Sure.
With pay!  She is out the door.
 You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
 You're Walter, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
I just wanted to make sure.
If you'll permit me to say so, sir, you were out on quite a bender last night, sir.
Bender? You're wrong, Walter. We started out to a binge but we never got to it.
 Yes, sir.
What's that?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
 Prairie? Oysters?
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
 Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
Oh, I do too, sir.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
You have no pants, sir.
You came home last night - without them.
 I did what!
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
What two policemen?
The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"
Listen, Walter, if a man named Morrow calls up, tell him I'm not in. He may be a great author, but I think he's crazy. The man's crazy, Walter.
Yes, sir. By the way, did you
 Please!
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
 Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
Looking for?
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
 Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
Very good, sir.  Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir. (he hands the telegram to Longfellow) I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
 Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
 Arthur wants to quit!
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
 What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to?
 And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
Oh, they insisted on following me.
 What do you think bodyguards are for?
 What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
Are those stories true?
I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
 I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
 No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
 Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
 But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
 Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
 Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
 Who? Miss Dawson?
Yes, sir.
Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
I enjoy it.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
 Hey, flap-ears![11] You better keep following that bus!
Keep your shirt on!
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Got any news
Sure. I met you.
 Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if
Yes, I know.
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
What did they say?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What did they say?
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
What are they going to do?
 Do you always wear your hair like that?
Isn't it a scream - "Cinderella Man!" The dope!
I'd like to get my hooks into that guy.
Don't worry. Somebody's probably taking him for plenty.
 If they were men, I'd knock their heads together.
Have you seen the papers?
Uh-huh.
That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff
"Cinderella Man!" I guess pretty soon everybody will be calling me "Cinderella Man."
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
Yes.
Yeah, let's.
Hey, wise guys. He's getting off.
Come on, don't you want to see it?
Feast your eyes. Grant's Tomb!
Is that it?  Hey, beetle-puss! The Tomb!
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
 It's wonderful.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
 Huh?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
That depends on what they see.
 Now, what do you see?
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
 Excuse me!
Sorry, Mr. Hopper. Mr. Cedar won't answer his phone. Sorry.
 Say, what's going on in the boss's office?
Search me. The three 'Cs' and little 'B' have been in there for over an hour.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is
 Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Yes, but you said
 I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
It's ridiculous for us to have to worry about a boy like that.  Look at these articles about him! "Cinderella Man!" Why, he's carrying on like an idiot.
Exactly what I was saying to my wife when this
Who cares what you were saying to your wife?
Yes?
Mr. and Mrs. Semple are still waiting.
 I can't help it. Let them wait!
Those people have been in to see me every day this week.
Who are they ?
 Relatives of old man Semple.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
Nuisance value?
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
 Nuisance value. (thinks a minutes - crosses to door) Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have!  Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?
We've been trying to
 Will you bring the chairs? Quickly. Will you have a cigar, Mr. Semple?
Thanks.
There's Times Square.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Why don't you try?
 Oh! It's breezy up here.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
Shall we go?
 Here's a nice place.
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
What's that?
You said I was a lady in distress.
Oh, that
What did you mean by that?
Nothing
Have you got a - are you - uh - engaged or anything?
No. Are you?
No.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
I haven't.
Why not?
Oh, I don't know.
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance.[12]  Except you, of course.  People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget how to live (thoughtfully; leans back) Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau said. They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
I'm from a small town too, you know.
 Really?
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
 Gosh! What do you know about that!
Ah, it's a beautiful little town, too. A row of poplar trees right along Main Street. Always smelled as if it just had a bath.
I've often thought about going back.
You have?
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
 He played in the town band, too.
He did? I play the tuba
Yeah, I know.
What did he play?
The drums. He taught me to play some.
He did?
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
 Sure!
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
It had better be good.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Shhh!
 Fire engine! Fire engine! I want to see how they do it. Wait for me, will you?
Looks like the evening is not going to be wasted!
Hello - what do you want?
 Captain Deeds - fire volunteer - Mandrake Falls.
 Hi, Cap! Boys, meet the Captain!
 What's the matter, hon?
 Nothing.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
No. It's nothing.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
 Don't be ridiculous.
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
 I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
 Uh-huh. I think I can tell you.
 Hello . . .  Yes, she's here. Who wants her?  Who?  Oh, yes. Yes, just a moment. (her hand over the mouthpiece) It's him - whatcha-ma-call-him - the "Cinderella Man." The "Cinderella Man"!
Hello.
 Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
 No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
 I'd like to read it some time.
Maybe I'll have it finished next time I see you.  Will I see you soon?  Gosh, that's swell, Mary.  Good night.
Good night.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
 Uh-huh.
I'm crucifying him.
People have been crucified before.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
Yeah, then what?
 Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
The guy's balmy.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
Huh?
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks. (sits at her typewriter) Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
I beg pardon, sir. I beg pardon, sir.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Who?
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
But she's on the telephone
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
Stop!
Hey, did you hear that?
What, sir?
 Why, that's an echo, sir!
You try it.
 Me, sir?
 Yeah.
 Louder.
 You try it.
Me, sir?
Louder!
You try it!
 All together!
Again!
 Let that be a lesson to you.
 Go back to your room, both of you!
Oh, hello darling.  So good of you to come. Sweet of you to ask me. Where is he? I'm just dying to see the "Cinderella Man."
Shh! - he may hear you.
Even if he heard you, he wouldn't understand.
I hear he still believes in Santa Claus.
Will he be Santa Claus? That's what I want to know.
Have you all got your slippers ready for the "Cinderella Man"?
 Yes, I have.
With $20,000,000, he doesn't have to have looks!
He won't have it long with that Pomponi woman hanging around him.
 My dear, I hear he can't think unless he plays his tuba!
 You're a fool, Babe.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
Running away is no solution.
 What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
You're acting like a school girl.
 What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
 It's those two sore spots again.
You shoulda been down to the office today, Babe.
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
Boy, was he burning.
 Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
 Just a minute. No, you don't.
We're not going out tonight.
Thought you had a date with him.
It's off. He's having a party at his house.
Say, what's the matter with her now !
You wouldn't know if I drew you a diagram. Now, run along and peddle your little tin-types.
What is this? Throwing us out of here's getting to be a regular habit.
Is Mary Dawson here? I'm Longfellow Deeds.
 Oh! Oh, yes, of course. Longfellow Deeds. Come in. Step in, please.
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
 Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
Is she home?
Yeah. What?
Is Mary home?
Oh, Mary? Yes, of course. Well, I don't know whether she's home or not. I'll see.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
Hello.
Hello, Mary. I waited in the park for you over an hour. I thought maybe you'd forgotten.
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
You threw them out!
You mean (gesturing with hands) by the neck or something?
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
I guess that'll be in the papers tomorrow. It will give 'em something else to laugh at.
 I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
 Would you like to go for a walk?
Yes, if it isn't too late.
 I'll get my hat.
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
 Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
 It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
Ready?
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
 Thank you.
 Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Thank you so much. Good night.
 Ow! My foot's asleep!
 Come on - let's go!
No, you don't. Just a minute. No more photographs.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Let's just walk, okay?
All right.
Mary, I'm going home.
Are you? When?
In a day or so, I think.
I don't blame you.
A man ought to know where he fits in. I just don't fit in around here. I once had an idea I could do something with the money, but they kept me so busy here, I haven't had time to figure it out. I guess I'll wait till I get back home.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
No, I don't mind.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
A girl?
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
Well, here we are again.
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
 Mary - I - excuse me
Goodbye, darling. Don't let anybody hurt you again - ever. They can't anyway. You're much too real. You go back to Mandrake Falls. That's where you belong - goodbye!
Mary
You know the poem I told you about? It's finished.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
 Yes, of course.
 You don't have to say anything, Mary. You can tell me tomorrow what you think.
"I tramped the earth with hopeless beat - Searching in vain for a glimpse of you. Then heaven thrust you at my very feet, A lovely angel - too lovely to woo."
"My dream has been answered, but my life's just as bleak, I'm handcuffed and speechless in your presence divine - for my heart longs to cry out, if it only would speak, 'I love you, my angel - be mine, be mine.' "
Oh, darling!
 You don't have to say anything now. I'll wait till tomorrow - till I hear from you.
 Hey, what's the big idea?
Stop it, Babe! Stop it! What do you mean, you're quitting! You might as well tell me I'm quitting.
What's bothering you, huh?
 Last night he proposed to me.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Yes.
 Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That"
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he
 Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
 Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
Well, I'll be
That's tough, Babe.
 What're you going to do?
 I'm going to tell him the truth.
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
You're crazy! You can't do that!
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
That's the rub.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
 Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
 Well, it was fun while it lasted, Mac. I'll clean out my desk.
How's it going? Okay?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
 Gold, eh?
 Yes, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Yes, sir.
Is that the best you've got?
Oh, yes sir.
 Get a smaller bowl, will you?
 A smaller bowl of flowers.
 Yes, sir. A smaller bowl of flowers.
 Did you get that stuff I was telling you about?
Stuff, sir?
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Yes, sir.
Now you got the idea. Fine.
 Sit over there, will you?
Me sir?
Yes.
Yes. You're too tall. Slink lower, will you?
More. Now forward.
 How is this, sir?
 Perfect! Perfect!
I wish you luck, sir.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
 Walter! Walter! Walter, where are you?
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
 Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing
 What are you talking about?
All right. Go ahead. Sock away, and then try to laugh this off.
 She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
 Shut up!
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
 I've seen 'em get in a rut like you before - but they always come back.  Hello . . . Yes. Just a minute.
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
 Hello . . .
Babe Bennett? Just a minute.
 Hello, Mary?
 Oh, hello darling.
 Is it you who's been writing those articles about me?
Why - uh - I was just leaving - I'll be up there in a minute  Look - uh, yes, I did - but I was just coming up to explain
 Oh listen, darling, wait a minute! Please! Listen
I beg pardon, sir. Shall I serve the wine with the squab, sir?
 I beg pardon, sir.
If I knew you were going to take it so hard, I woulda kept my mouth shut. Sorry.
 Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
Yes, sir.
 You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
They can have the Estate.
 You can't come up here!
Let me go! I wanna see him!
He's not home, I tell you!
I wanna see that guy!
We'll send for the police!
Let me go!
What's going on here?
There he is! I just wanted to get a look at him.
There you are! I just wanted to see what kind of a man you were!
 I just wanted to see what a man looks like that can spend thousands of dollars on a party - while people around him are hungry! The "Cinderella Man," huh?  Did you ever stop to think how many families could have been fed on the money you pay out to get on the front pages?
Come on! Take him out of here!
Let me go!
 Let him alone.
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
 Shall I call the police, sir?
No!  What do you want!!
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
Sure - everybody's a moocher to you. A mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
 This won't do you any good
Stay where you are, young feller. Get over there.
 You're about to get some more publicity, Mr. Deeds!  You're about to get on the front page again! See how you're going to like it this time!  See what good your money's going to do when you're six feet under ground. You never thought of that, did you? No! All you ever thought of was pinching pennies - you money- grabbing hick! You never gave a thought to all of those starving people  standing in the bread lines  not knowing where their next meal was coming from!  Not able to feed their wife and kids.  Not able to
 Oh!
 I'm glad I didn't hurt nobody. Excuse me.
 Crazy. You get all kinds of crazy ideas.
Sorry. I didn't know what I was doing.
Losing your farm after twenty years' work - seeing your kids go hungry - a game little wife saying "Everything's going to be all right."  Standing there in the bread lines. It killed me to take a handout.  I ain't used to it.  Go ahead and do what you want with me, mister.  I guess I'm at the end of my rope.
 Can I take some of this home with me?
Go on. Step lively.
 Are you married?
Yes, sir.
Any children?
No, no children.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify. (he hands him a form) Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
 Thank you very much.
Next, please.
 How many does that make?
You've okayed 819.
 Is that all?
That's all.
It's going awfully slow. We need 1100 more.  Hello . . . oh, yes. Yes. The water development seems okay - but I don't like the road layout yet. Come up tonight about ten and bring the maps. Right.
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Oh, Mr. Deeds
my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night.
 Well, thanks, I - uh (to applicant in front of him) How do you do? What is your name?
George Rankin, sir.
 No! No! We're not buying any bulls. What's that?
We have very little time. He's ordered me to turn everything over to him immediately. We have to work fast before he disposes of every penny.
See!  I told you something could be done. I knew it all the time. Sign it, dear.
 We may get into trouble.
Oh, don't be so squeamish.
There are millions involved. After all, you have your legal rights. You're his only living relatives.
What's it say?
That's your agreement with Mr. Cedar, if we win.
You see, my end is going to be rather expensive. I have a lot of important people to take care of. I have the legal machinery all set and ready to go. I've been working on nothing else for the last week. You say the word, and we'll stop this yokel dead in his tracks.
Sign it!
Oh, all right.
 Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
All set.
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie
Yeah?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Okay.
What is your name?
Christian Svenson.
Farmer?
Yes, ma'am.
Where is your farm?
South Dakota north.
South Dakota - north?
South Dakota - but on the top.
Oh. Oh!
What about your knocking off for lunch?
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
 Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
 Oh, sure, sure. If you like to have a sandwich, I can give you one, please.
 Thanks. Thank you. Never mind, Cobb.
Good.
 Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
 What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
 Go on, say something. Say something!
Mr. Deeds, the boys here wanted me to say a little something. They just wanted me to say that  Well, they wanted me to say that (quickly gets it out) We think you're swell - and that's no baloney.
Say something more!
Give me a chance, fellas. We're all down and out - but when a fellow like you comes along, kinda gives us a little hope - and they just wanted me to say
 Yes?
 A what?
What's up? What do you mugs want?
Insanity! Who's says he's insane?
The complainant is a relative of the late Martin Semple. The charges are that Mr. Deeds is insane and incapable of handling the Estate.
Oh, somebody got panic-stricken about his giving his dough away, eh?  Where do you think you're going to take him?
Of course, that's only temporary. A hearing will follow immediately.
That's fine. Just because I want to give this money to people who need it, they think I'm crazy.  That's marvelous. That makes everything complete.
Wait a minute! Not so fast. We're going to get a lawyer. I'll call Cedar.
 No, don't bother.
As a matter of fact, I'm from Mr. Cedar's office. He represents the complainant.
Oh.
 All right, I'll go. But get your hands off me!
 Make way! Make way!
 Yes, most everybody in town has been here to see him. Yes, sir. I won't. Goodbye
Sorry, lady
Oh, please! I've got to see him.
Now listen, sister, for the fourteenth and last time he don't want to see nobody.
 Will you just give him my name?
 Listen, toots, just between us, there ain't a thing in the world the matter with that guy till I mention your name, then he goes haywire!
What are you going to do - just sit back and let them railroad you? It's as pretty a frameup as ever hit this rotten town! If you'd just let me get you a lawyer!
 You can't walk into that courtroom without being ready to protect yourself in the clinches. Cedar's too smart. With the array of talent he's got lined up against you - you're cooked!
Listen, pal - I know just how you feel. A blonde in Syracuse put me through the same paces. I came out with a sour puss - but full of fight. Come on, you don't want to lay down now.
Do you realize what's happening? They're trying to prove that you're nuts!  If they win the case, they'll shove you in the bughouse. The moment they accuse you of it, they have you half licked. You've got to fight!
Go on, sit down, won't you?
So long, Mr. Cobb.
Corny!
Corny!
I've got to see him! I've got to talk to him!
Haven't you done enough damage already?
 Somebody's got to help him! He hasn't got a chance against Cedar. Look, I've been all over town talking to everybody. I've got Mac all lined up - and the paper's behind him. And I can get him Livingston, too. With a lawyer like Livingston, he's got a fighting chance.
 You're wasting your time. He doesn't want any lawyers. He's sunk so low, he doesn't want help from anybody.  You can take a bow for that.  As swell a guy as ever hit this town, and you crucified him!  For a couple of stinking headlines! You've done your bit - now stay out of his way!
 Here he is!
 Cedar just sent for me. Wants to make a settlement. Here's your chance to get out of the whole mess. What do you say?
Quiet, please! The Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, is now in session, the Honorable John May, Judge, presiding. Be seated.
The court wishes to warn those present that it will tolerate no disturbances.  Regarding the sanity hearing of Longfellow Deeds, are you represented by counsel, Mr. Deeds?
I understand that you have no counsel, Mr. Deeds. In fact, that you have no intention of defending any of these charges. Now, if you wish to change your mind, the hearing can be postponed.
Proceed.
 and in the interests of my client, the only other living relative of the late Martin W. Semple, we cannot permit a fortune so huge to be dissipated by a person whose incompetency and abnormality we shall prove beyond any reasonable doubt.
I have before me a series of articles written by a newspaper woman who was an eye-witness to his conduct ever since he came to New York.
She tells how, in the midst of a normal conversation, he would suddenly begin playing his tuba. She tells of his attacks upon several of our eminent writers - for no apparent reason. In fact, there are many instances not recorded in these articles in which Mr. Deeds satisfied an unnatural desire to smash people up without provocation.
I, myself, unable to keep pace with his mental quirks, and constantly fearful of assault, turned down an opportunity to represent him as his attorney. This newspaper woman, whom we have subpoenaed to testify, tells how he tied up traffic for an hour feeding doughnuts to a poor horse. And by his own statement, waiting for that horse to ask for a cup of coffee.
We have photographs to substantiate this little episode, and other photographs showing Mr. Deeds jumping upon a fire engine. This scarcely sounds like the action of a man in whom the disposition of twenty million dollars may safely be entrusted. This writer of these articles - a woman whose intelligence and integrity in the newspaper world is unquestioned - held him in such contempt that she quite aptly named him "The Cinderella Man."
We have witnesses here from Mandrake Falls, his own home town, who will tell of his conduct throughout his lifetime, proving that his derangement is neither recent nor a temporary one.
We have others who will tell of his unusual behavior when he invited the great leaders of the musical world to his home, and then proceeded to forcibly eject them. Only recently when he was in the County Hospital for observation, he not only refused to be examined by these gentlemen, the state psychiatrists, but he actually made a violent attack upon them.
In these times, with the country incapacitated by economic ailments, and endangered with an undercurrent of social unrest, the promulgation of such a weird, fantastic and impractical plan as contemplated by the defendant, is capable of fomenting a disturbance from which the country may not soon recover. It is our duty to stop it! Our government is fully aware of its difficulties and can pull itself out of its economic rut without the assistance of Mr. Deeds, or any other crackpot.
His attempted action must therefore be attributed to a diseased mind afflicted with hallucinations of grandeur, and obsessed with an insane desire to become a public benefactor.
 Your Honor, at this time, we would like to call our first witness: Miss Louise - Babe - Bennett.
Miss Bennett, please.
Raise your right hand, please.
Do you solemnly swear the testimony you may give before this court to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
State your right name, please.
Louise Bennett.
Take the stand.
Miss Bennett, are you employed by the Morning Mail?
I must ask you to direct your attention to me.
 Your Honor, this is ridiculous!
Please answer the questions.
 The whole hearing's ridiculous! That man's no more insane than you are.
Miss Bennett please!
This is outrageous!
 It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Your Honor!
 Young lady, another outburst like that and I shall hold you in contempt!  We're not interested in your opinion of the merits of this case. You're here to testify. Sit down and answer the questions. Proceed.
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
 No!
 You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
 No! I resigned last week!
Well, prior to that time - were you employed by the Morning Mail?
 Yes.
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Yes!
 Are these the articles?
Yes!
Were you present when all these things took place?
Yes!
Are they true!
NO!!
But they did take place?
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
And you saw them happen?
Yes, but I
 That's all, Miss Bennett.
 It isn't all! I'd like to explain
 That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Come on, miss - come on!
 Your Honor, I'd like to submit these articles as evidence.
 Let go of me! (steps up to Judge; wildly) What kind of hearing is this? What are you trying to do - persecute the man? He's not defending himself. Somebody's got to do it!
Miss Bennett, please!
I've got a right to be heard! I've attended dozens of cases like this. They're usually conducted without any formality at all. Anybody can be heard! My opinion is as good as these quack psychiatrists. I know him better than they do.
Miss Bennett, if you have quite finished, I should like to inform you that one more utterance from you and I shall place you under arrest.  I'm willing to hear anything anyone has to say - but I insist on it being done in an orderly fashion. When you have learned to show some respect for this court, you may return.  Until then, you'd better go back to your seat and calm down.
This way, miss.
Order in the court!
Mr. Deeds, have you anything to say in defense of these articles?
Mr. Deeds?  Mark these Exhibit A for the plaintiff.
Yes, Your Honor.
Proceed.
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
 Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
What is your name, please?
Jane Falkner. This is my sister, Amy.
 Yes - Amy.
I'll direct my questions to you, Miss Jane. You can answer for both. Do you know the defendant, Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Oh yes, yes - of course we know him.
 How long have you known him?
 Since he was born.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
He was a seven-months baby.
Thank you, that's fine. Do you see him very often?
Most every day.
Sometimes twice.
 Must we have the echo?
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
They think he's pixilated.
Oh yes, pixilated.
 He's what?
 What was that you said he was?
Pixilated.
Uh-huh.
 Now, that's a rather strange word to use, Miss Jane. Can you tell the court exactly what it means?
Perhaps I can explain, Your Honor. The word pixilated is an early American expression - derived from the word 'pixies,' meaning elves. They would say, 'The pixies had got him,' as we nowadays would say a man is 'balmy.'
Is that correct?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Now tell me, why does everyone think he's - uh - pixilated? Does he do peculiar things?
 He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Sometimes he whistles.
And sings.
Anything else?
Recently he gave Chuck Dillon a thumping.
Blacked his eye.
And why?
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
He sure is pixilated.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
Thank you, ladies. That's all.
They kept hollering: "Back to Nature! Back to Nature!"  I thought they looked harmless enough so I took them home. I never thought he was cracked.
I'm a waiter. He kept pressing me to point out the celebrities, and so help me Hannah I'm coming out of the kitchen a coupla minutes later and there he is moppin' up the floors with them. I never figured he was a guy looking for trouble.
 He threw us out bodily! But bodily!
We was hired as his bodyguard, see? Well, the first crack out of the box, he throws us in a room and locks the door, see? Now, if a thing like that gets around in our profession, we'd get the bird - see? So I says to my partner, "Let's quit this guy, he's nuts!"
I'm very fond of Clara, sir. She's a nice 'orse. And when this bloke 'ere started feedin' 'er doughnuts, I yelled down to him, "Mind what you're doin' down there! Mind what you're doing'!" Of course I wouldn't mind, sir, but Clara won't eat nothin' but doughnuts, now.
Come to order.
Your Honor, I wish to call your attention to these exhibits. Mr. Davis, do you recognize these reproductions?
Sure, they're good enlargements. Where'd you have them made?
Did you make the originals of them?
Sure. I took the originals. Taking pictures is my business. I photograph a lot of nuts.
And now, Your Honor, if the court pleases, I shall call upon Dr. Emil Von Holler, if he will be good enough to give us his opinion. Dr. Von Holler, as you know, is the eminent Austrian psychiatrist - probably the greatest authority on the subject in the world. At present he is in this country on a lecture tour, and has graciously volunteered his services. Dr. Von Holler?
Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give in the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? State your right name, please.
 Emil Von Holler.
Take the stand.
Now Dr. Von Holler, will you kindly tell the court what your opinion is on this case?
This is purely a case of manic depression. In cases of this kind, patients sometimes go on for years before being detected.
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
 Uh-huh.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Ja.
It takes so long to detect them  because their mood changes so often and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may I show you? May I use the chart?
By all means.
 Below here, they are extremely depressed, melancholy, impossible to live with, and often become violent.  From this mood the manic depressive might gradually change until they reach this state. (he reaches the center line) Here is lucidity. Here they are perfectly normal. As normal as you or I  assuming, of course, that we are normal. (he starts up with chalk) Then, the mood changes again until  they reach this state, a state of highest exaltation. Here everything is fine. Here the world is beautiful. Here they are so elated - how do you express it? (quickly, as it comes to him) they would give you the shirt off their backs!
Dr. Von Holler, how would you say that applied to Mr. Deeds's case?
The symptoms are obvious.  When he was here, on top of the wave, he felt nothing but kindliness and warmth toward his fellow-men. He wanted them around him. So he decided he would give a big reception. But in the meantime, his mood has changed.  He is now at the bottom of the wave - depressed - melancholy. So, when his guests arrive, he throws them out. They are now his imaginary enemies.
Other instances of high elation are when he plays his tuba, when he writes his poetry, when he chases fire engines in his desire to help humanity. This is contrasted with his present mood, which is so low that even the instinct for self- preservation is lacking.
Oh, the man is verrukt. Your Honor, this is decidedly a case of a manic depressive.
Thank you, Dr. Von Holler.
Your Honor, we rest.
Come on, what're you going to do? Let them get away with it? They got you cooked.
 Mr. Deeds, before the court arrives at a decision, isn't there anything you wish to say?
 Come on - don't be a sap!
He's sunk.
 You both concur?
 Oh, positively.
Mr. Deeds, in view of the extensive testimony and your continued silence and upon recommendation of the doctors, the Court considers it advisable for your own safety that you be committed to an institution as prescribed by law. You need medical attention, Mr. Deeds.  Perhaps in a little while
No! No! No! Wait a minute!
You can't do it! You've got to make him talk.
Your Honor, I object!
 Oh, darling, please. I know everything I've done. I know how horrible I've been. No matter what happens, if you never see me again, do this for me.
Miss Bennett, please!
 You said I could speak! You said I could have my say if I were rational. I'm rational. Please, let me take the witness chair.
He must be made to defend himself before you arrive at a decision.
Very well. Take the stand.
Oh, thank you!
 Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
Let her speak.
I know why he won't defend himself! That has a bearing on the case, hasn't it? He's been hurt!  He's been hurt by everybody's he met since he came here, principally by me. He's been the victim of every conniving crook in town. The newspapers pounced on him - made him a target for their feeble humor.
I was smarter than the rest of them!  I got closer to him so I could laugh louder. Why shouldn't he keep quiet? Every time he said anything it was twisted around to sound imbecilic.
He can thank me for it! I handed the gang a grand laugh. This is a fitting climax to my sense of humor.
But Your Honor - this is preposterous!
Certainly I wrote those articles. I was going to get a raise - and a month's vacation! But I stopped writing them when I found out what he was all about! When I realized how real he was.
He could never fit in with our distorted viewpoint because he's honest and sincere - and good. If that man is crazy, Your Honor, the rest of us belong in straight- jackets.
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
What's that got to do with it?
 Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
 What's that got to do with it?
 You are , aren't you?
 Yes!!!
Your Honor, her testimony is of no value. Why shouldn't she defend him? It's a tribute to American womanhood - the instinct to protect the weak. I'm not saying that nobody likes the boy. I cherish a fond affection for him myself. But that doesn't mean to sayIn the middle of his speech, Mac - the editor - appears at his elbow.
When the windbag here gets through, Your Honor, I'd like to verify what Miss Bennett said. I'm her editor. When she quit her job, she told me what a swell fellow this man was. And anything Babe Bennett says is okay with me.
If you have anything to say, you will take the stand.
I've already said it, Your Honor. I just thought I'd like to get my two cents in.
Don't be a sucker, pal. Stand up and speak your piece.
Your Honor, I've got a couple of cents I'd like to put in
Sit down!
I've been with this man ever since he came to New York
Sit down! There will be no further interruptions.
How about us, Mr. Deeds!
 Yes! What about us, Mr. Deeds! You're not going to leave us out in the cold! They're trying to frame you, Mr. Deeds!
Order! Order!
 In the interest of Mr. Deeds, I have tolerated a great deal of informality. But if there is one more outburst, I shall have the courtroom cleared.
Your Honor
 Yes?
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Take the stand!
Proceed.
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I
About my playing the tuba. Seems like a lot of fuss has been made about that. If a man's crazy just 'cause he plays the tuba, then somebody better look into it, 'cause there are a lot of tuba players running around loose. Of course, I don't see any harm in it. I play mine whenever I want to concentrate. That may sound funny to some people - but everybody does something silly when they're thinking. For instance, the Judge here is an O-filler. . .
A what?
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
That may make you look a little crazy, Your Honor, just sitting around filling in O's - but I don't see anything wrong 'cause that helps you to think. Other people are doodlers.
Doodlers?
That's a name we made up back home for people who make foolish designs on paper when they're thinking. It's called doodling. Almost everybody's a doodler. Did you ever see a scratch pad in a telephone booth? People draw the most idiotic pictures when they're thinking. Dr. Von Holler, here, could probably think up a long name for it, because he doodles all the time.
 Thank you. (returning to the stand) This is a piece of paper he was scribbling on.  I can't figure it out. One minute it looks like a chimpanzee - and the next minute it looks like a picture of Mr. Cedar.  You look at it, Judge.
Exhibit A - for the defense.  Looks kind of stupid, doesn't it, Your Honor? But I guess that's all right if Dr. Von Holler has to doodle to help him think. That's his business. Everybody does something different. Some people are  ear-pullers - some are nail-biters  That Mr. Semple over there is a nose-twitcher.
And the lady next to him is a knuckle-cracker.
So you see, everybody does silly things to help them think.  Well, I play the tuba.
Nice work, toots!
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Your Honor, this is becoming farcical. I demand that Mr. Deeds dispense with side remarks and confine himself to facts! Let him explain his wanderings around the streets in underclothes, his feeding doughnuts to horses!
Proceed.
Mr. Cedar's right. Those things do look kind of bad, don't they?  But to tell the truth, Your Honor, I don't remember them. I guess they happened, all right, because I don't think a policeman would lie about a thing like that, but I was drunk. It was the first time I was ever drunk in my life. It's probably happened to you, some time. I mean, when you were younger, of course.
It's likely to happen to anybody. Just the other morning I read in the paper about Mr. Cedar's own son - about how he got drunk and insisted on driving a taxi-cab, while the driver sat inside. Isn't that so, Mr. Cedar? Isn't that so , Mr. Cedar?
Your Honor, I object.
Proceed.
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Not at all.
Jane, who owns the house you live in?
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Yes, you own it.
Do you pay any rent?
 No, we don't pay any rent.
Good heavens, no! We never pay rent.
Are you happy there?
Oh, yes.
Yes, indeed.
Now, Jane, a little while ago you said I was pixilated. Do you still think so?
 Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
Always.
 That's fine. I guess maybe I am.  Now tell me something, Jane. Who else in Mandrake Falls is pixilated?
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Uh-huh.
Now, just one more question. Do you see the Judge here? He's a nice man, isn't he?
Do you think he's pixilated?
 Oh, yes.
Yes, indeedy.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
Suppose you were living in a small town and getting along fine, and suddenly somebody dropped $20,000,000 in your lap. Supposing you discovered that all that money was messing up your life, was bringing a lot of vultures around your neck, and making you lose faith in everybody. You'd be a little worried, wouldn't you? You'd feel that you had a hot potato in your hand, and you'd want to drop it. I guess Dr. Von Holler would say you were riding on  those bottom waves, 'cause you wanted to drop something that was burning your fingers.
 If this man is permitted to carry out his plan, repercussions will be felt that will rock the foundations of our entire governmental system!
Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
It's like the road out in front of my house. It's on a steep hill. Every day I watch the cars climbing up. Some go lickety-split up that hill on high
some have to shift into second - and some sputter and shake and slip back to the bottom again. Same cars - same gasoline - yet some make it and some don't. And I say the fellows who can make the hill on high should stop once in a while and help those who can't.
 That's all I'm trying to do with this money. Help the fellows who can't make the hill on high.
 What does Mr. Cedar expect me to do with it? Give it to him - and a lot of other people who don't need it? (rising; sarcastically) If you don't mind, Your Honor, I'll ride on those top waves for a minute.  Hey, all you fellows out there! All those who applied for a farm, stand up!
See all those fellows?  They're the ones I'm trying to help. They need it!  Mr. Cedar and that Mr. Semple don't need anything. They've got plenty! It's like I'm out in a big boat and I see one fellow in a rowboat who's tired of rowing and wants a free ride - and another fellow who's drowning. Who would you expect me to rescue? Mr. Cedar, who just got tired of rowing and wants a free ride? Or those men out there who are drowning?  Any ten-year- old child will give you the answer to that. (to farmers etc. in courtroom) All right, fellows. Thank you. Sit down.
Now, my plan is very simple. I was going to give each family ten acres - a horse, a cow and some seed. And if they work the farm for three years, it's theirs. Now, if that's crazy, maybe I ought to be sent to an institution. But I don't think it is. And what's more, Mr. Cedar doesn't either.  Just before the hearing started, he offered to call the whole thing off if I made a settlement with him. So you see, he wouldn't think I was crazy if he got paid off.
It's a lie!
Mr. Cedar!
Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
I've never heard anything so colossally stupid in my life!
It's an insult to our intelligence to sit here and listen to his childish ravings.
 You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
But your honor
Mr. Cedar!
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
 No. (changes his mind; turns to Judge) Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Proceed.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Order! Order! Order in the court!
Remain seated and come to order. The Court is again in session.
Before the Court announces its decision, I want to warn all who are here that the police have orders to arrest anyone creating a disturbance.
 Mr. Deeds, there has been a great deal of damaging testimony against you. Your behavior, to say the least, has been most strange.
But in the opinion of the Court, you are not only sane, but you are the sanest man that ever walked into this courtroom. Case dismissed!
You nose-twitcher!
Oh, I knew it! I knew it! You, you
He's still pixilated.
He sure is.
