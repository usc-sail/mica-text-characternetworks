space with older items; framed pictures, Victorian automata, wax dolls, and  items of punishment; stocks, iron boots, chastity belts, whips. Could that really be an Electric Chair glimpsed in the shadowed back of the room?
Wow ...
You want it?
Is it yours?
No.  Not mine.  Yours.
How much do you want for it?
Whatever you think its worth.
Enjoy ...
It's a mystery to me ...
Most nights this inner-city Emergency Room would be a chaos of blood and panic and grace under pressure.  But tonight, as you see, it's like Death took a holiday.  It's a mystery to me ... A mystery how those assholes at Assignments knew it.  This is Joey Summerskill for W-QQY.  Emergency Room. No story.  Really, really pissed off.
Ah, break it down, Doc.  It's a bust.
She can talk like this on television? She can say this thing?  This assholes?
No sweat, sweetheart.  It's for the European satellite ....  Joey; rein it in, kid.  They couldn't've known.
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
Speak.
Doc.  24th and Cedar.  Fast.  Hostage situation.
OK.  Listen - Joey's here.  Shall ...
No need.  Martin's already there. Hurry.  You've got ambulances to beat.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.
That is the story of my life.
It wasn't my fault.  It wasn't my fault.
10 milligram IV Valium stat.  How the fuck did this happen ... ?!
It was outside.  I wasn't even with him.
You ever see anything like this before?
He must have stolen it.
What's going on?
Yeah, sure.  Five times a fucking day. Just push!
It was off the statue.  In the club.
What happened to him?
Think they'll get him back?
It's nothing to do with me.
Worst case of status I've seen.  Even money at best.
Wait!  I'm a reporter!  Tell me where he was ...
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
 It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
Where?
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Who's that?  Get her out of here!
 See?  This is what I mean.  Your technique is all wrong.
 What do you mean?
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
Fuck you.
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
 Jesus Christ ...
Ah, give her a break.
 What's with you?
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
I know what I saw.
And I believe what you say.  But this is TV.  No pictures, no story.
Yeah, too bad I had to go and ...
... and cover something on Planet Earth. See, you gotta remember, Joey; this is a LOCAL station.  As in local to this galaxy.
There's a story out there.
 Not on station time.
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
Lot of attitude there, Doc ...
... but great legs.
 Call for a Medi-Vac!
 Don't die, man!  Don't fucking die!
 God.  This better be birth, marriage, or death ...
Uh-huh?
 Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
Right.  Right!
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... Look, I'll make a deal with you ... My boyfriend threw me out, right?  I'll trade you. You give me couch-space.  I'll give you talk.  OK?
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
 Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
Hi.  How're you doing?
You got anything to drink?
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
Right.
So ... what was your bad dream?
What?
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
Oh yeah ...
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
What is it?
Why are you so interested?
Sorry.
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
 Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
That's great.
What?
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them.
Whatever.  All I know is - this is it for me.  Just me, my bag, and a series of shithead boyfriends.  It'd be good to see something else.  Have a nighttime life.  Be somebody different.
Hey ... this is great, isn't it?  Just girls talking.  Like having a conversation?  Good coffee.  You got a cigarette?
Uh ...  yeah.  Yeah, somewhere.  Wait a minute.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
I'm trying to quit.
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Wanna know how I look at it?  Way I see it is ... you give up, right?  Three days later, you get hit by a fucking truck and you know - you just KNOW that your last thought as you go under those wheels'd be "Jesus H. Christ, I coulda smoked another three packs!"
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
Did you know him?
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
Taken what?
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
He said they came out of this.
All done, Mr. Monroe.
 Ass hole.
What the ... ?
Aaaaaahh!!
Son of a ...
 ... bi ...
 Oh my God ...
 Did I sleep through an earthquake?
I figured I'd make breakfast.
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me.
I'll boil some water.
I'll do it!
No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love boiling water.  It's a specialty of mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
How have you ... ?
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
Great view!  Great view!  Look at this!
Actually, I'm pretty familiar with the view ...
 ... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
 Who's that?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
And he still sits there?
Every day.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
No.  He knows it won't.  It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
Bullshit!  He should've kept it.  It'd live longer!  It's dangerous out there! People get hurt!
What?  I wasn't talking about ... I ... Do you want to stay?  You want to stay here for a while?
OK.  OK.  It's a done deal.  But look you have to help me.  I've got to solve this thing.  I've got to know what's going on.
But I don't know what's going on.
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Would you know this store again?
Sure.  Why?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
What on earth were you doing down here?
Terri?
Buying some drugs, alright?
Oh, Terri ...
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
Here!  Here!  Pull over!
Yeah.  See.  I told you it was here.
 Can I help?
Yes.  Thank you.  We were wondering ... Terri, show her the box.
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
No.  We want ...
I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business.  I ...
Lady, will you shut the fuck up and give her a break.
Quite a mouth.  So what's the problem? You tell me.  You I like.
Thank you.  This came off a ... statue? A pillar.  We wondered if you knew anything about the piece.  About where it came from.
Oh ... yeah.  Yeah.  That thing.  Ugly. Real ugly.  I sold that?
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
Can we see?
You gonna buy?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
Terri, check out the other folder.
What am I looking for?
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
Jesus.  You're gonna pay her for this shit?  It's like fucking business papers for God's sake!
 Alright ...
Joey ... ?
 Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
Yeah ... yeah ... yeah ... No, it's important that I speak to ... What?  No, don't ...                 Put. Me.  On.  Hold.  You.  Stupid.  Bitch.
Hi.  Now listen.  And listen good.  I'm the Station Manager at W-QQY.  For the last half-hour you've been dicking around with my assistant.  Let me tell you something.  With or without your co- operation we are making this expose.  I assume you're smart enough to guess which version is going to make you look good.  Now, if you can't put one hand on that cassette and the other on a FedEx man's butt within thirty seconds then you damn well better put me through to somebody who can.
Dr.  Fallon?  How nice of you to take my call.  I understand you're in charge of video archive from the Channard Institute ... ?
Welcome.
You're JP Monroe, right?
Uh-huh.
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
Thank you.
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
A prize?  For what?
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
I'm sorry.
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
No.  Really?
Yes really.
Wow.  Thank you.
No.  Thank you.
Terri?
 Ms.  Summerskill.  Joanne.  Hello.  This is Dr. Fallon.  Martin.  Your reference material is on its way to you.  I very much enjoyed talking to you and I hope that if I'm ever in town you'll do me the honor of
In your dreams, pal.
 ... your number from your resume. Which was very impressive, by the way. My name is Sharon Leech and you can reach me here at K-YZY in Monterey, area code 805 ...
 Shit. Why now? Why not last week? Oh ...
 Goodnight, Terri ...
So cool ...
Radical.
Wow.  You've got great taste.  This ... well ... this really says it, you know? It's really ... dark.
Don't you think?
Mmn-hmnn.
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
Unh-unh.
If it bothers you, just say so.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
But you gave me a rose ...
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
Look at you!  You think you're some God damn Prince or something.  With your shitty little Kingdom out there and all this ugly shi ....
Jesus Christ!
Not quite.
What ... What ... ?
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Yes.
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
How uncomfortable that word must feel on your lips.  Evil.  Good.  There is no Good, Monroe.  There is no Evil.  There is only the flesh and the patterns to which we can submit it.  You will help me to ...
No.  No no no.  No fuckin' way.  I'm gone ...
 Another offering?
I'm touched ... That is the gun you used to kill your parents?
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
Fuck you!
Thank you.  Now, shall we talk sensibly?
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
What are you?
A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.
Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
But how in God's name ...
God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
How do we start?
It has already begun.
 Alright ... Let's see what we got here.
 I don't know what the Box is.  But I know what it does.  I ...    (looks up to side)     I've said all this before. Do you ...    (blinks, nods, as if listening.  Looks back to camera)  I saw it open.  I opened it.  I saw what came out.  I don't know what else to call them.  Demons.  Demons live in the box. Or come through the box from somewhere else.  It's a gateway to Hell.  Or the South Bronx.     (smiles ruefully at her own joke.  Looks up to side as if chastised for kidding around.  Nods. Continues)     I know you don't believe me.  I know what it sounds like.  But what else ... Jesus, talk to Ronson, talk to the other cops.  They saw the house.  They saw my ... my father ...
 Solving the puzzle means opening the box.  Opening the box means opening doors.  And there are some doors you don't want to open.  And it may be metaphorical to you, Doctor, but you haven't had some blue-faced bastard come at you with hooks and chains.  It isn't delusion, it isn't psychosis.  It's reality.  It's reality.     (Pause. Long drag on the cigarette?)   Maybe not this reality ... but there are others. I've seen them.
Jeez, Joey musta polished you up some. Sometimes I think she's wierder than me.
Joey?
 Not quite.
JP?
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
What do you want?
God, always questions.  What do I want? I don't want anything.  Just concerned about you.  Just checking in.
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Really?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
You're apologizing?
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
I miss you too.
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Yes.
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
Oh, I don't ...
C'mon.  It'll be great.
No!  No.  I can't.  I just can't.
Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  Shit.
 Hi.  You've reached Joanne Summerskill. In spirit at least.  Please leave a message.  Thanks.
 Hello.  Ms. Summerskill, this is Sharon Leech again from K-YZY in Monterey. Sorry to call so late but I was wondering if you got my other message? Look, I probably shouldn't say this on tape but what the hell ... there's a job here if you want it.  Late-night news reader.  We think you'd be marvelous ..
Again?  (Shrugs. Looks back at camera)  The box.  I don't know where it came from.  I don't know who made it or why.  I only know what it does.  It hurts.  It hurts.   (Looks off to side as if listening.)  How?  (Looks back)  I don't know.  It kind of opens itself.  Your fingers move.  You learn. It wants to open, that's the thing.  And it knows when you want to open it.  And it helps.  And it opens.  And then they come.  The Cenobites.  The demons.
 She's telling the truth, Joey.
Look, you can have me tell this ...
...  as often as you want.  There's not going to be any breakthrough.  You might think it's delusion, but it's not.  I saw them.  I looked into their eyes and they looked back at me.  Creatures from Hell.
Hey, babe.  Thanks for coming.
Terri, we can't bunk up every night! People will ...
 ... talk.  ... Terri?
Oh shit.
 He's going.  He's going.  He's going ...
 We're losing him.  We're losing him. We're losing him ...
 Noooooooooo .......
Nooooooooooo!
Is somebody here?  Is somebody here!? Terri ... ?
What ... What's going on?  What's happening?
You have to help me, Joey.
Come on in.
Not a good neighborhood.  People disappear.    Feel like home? It's just like you left it.
Not quite.  This wasn't here.
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Yeah right.  Look ...
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
Really?
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
No.  No, sweetheart, you come to me. It's not fair.  I come over there.  You know.  We're on the bed.  I just ... 'cos you know how much you excite me. God, just looking at you.  You're so beautiful.  I come over there and I'd just want to touch you.  Feel you.  Kiss you.  And that isn't what this is about. C'mon, babe, come to daddy.  Let me make it better.
No ... Wait a ...
Bring her to me, boy!
Wait!  Why run?  Where to?  Do you know where you are?
I'm ... I'm ...
You're at the door of dreams.  And you can open it.
What are you talking about?
There are two keys in this room.  On is in the pocket of this fool.  You could take it out without me reaching you. (a beat)  Probably.  And you could use it to let yourself back in to the world you know.  The world you've always known; banal, hopeless, dreamless.
And ... like ... the other?
The other is the key to dreams.  To a world of black miracles and dark wonder. Another life of unknown pleasures.  It's yours.  Complete the pattern.  Solve the puzzle.  Turn the key.
Where is it?
It's lying bleeding at your feet.
 Unhhh ... Terri ... what ... no ...
 No! Terri! Please! I didn't mean to..!!
I have such sights to show you.
How .... ?
... and the King has sent a personal message of sympathy to the parents of those brave men who ...
L'Oiseau chante avec ses doigts.  Deux fois.
Joey.  Look out your window.
Tell me ... Tell me ... Hello?
I'm seven floors up ... I'm seven floors up! I can't ...
Now what?  I'm here.  Now what?  I just walked into madness for you.  Talk!
Great.  That's just great!  You bring me here.  You freeze up on me.  And now there's no way out.  I've had dates like you before.  I ...
Thanks.  I think.
What's going on?  Is this a dream?
Joey.  How kind of you to come.
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
Joey Summerskill.
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
There were days in this war, days right on top of each other, when the newly dead were numbered in the tens of thousands.  They called it the war to end all wars.  Though it didn't.  You know that.  There were more wars.  More dead.  Your father's war.  Your dream search for your father led you here.  To me.  Joey, we need to talk.
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
And what is ... this frozen moment?
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
And what did you discover?
Something bad.
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
Because something worse is coming.
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
What will he do?  What does he want?
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
What can we do?
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
I don't know ...
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
Then tell me what to do.
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
So where is it?
Your apartment.
Wha .... ?
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
 Oh My God ...
Hello?
 You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
 Judas Priest!  Will you look at ...
Move it!  Now!  No pictures!
 W-QQY.  I ...
I don't give a shit!  Move it or lose it!
Oh my God, it's happening ...
I thought ... what's ... I think there's something up there ...
No!  No, Doc, don't ... don't ...
Shit!  What was ...
Well, we've ... er ... yes, we've temporarily lost our pictures there and ... and ...
Doc!  DOC!!
C'mon.  C'mon!
I'll get it!  I promise!  I'll ...
Don't promise me shit, you little fuck! You know what your promise is worth to me?  Huh?  Fifty per cent of fuck-all!
Give him the money, Eddie.
I don't ...
Give him the money, Eddie.
Just listen to me, Please!  I ...
I'm done listening, shit-brain!  Where you been all day?  They shut the school? Kindergarten closed?  No customers? Huh?  Huh?
Give him the money, Eddie.  Tell ya, I'm gonna puke if he beats on you any more. Just give him the ...
... money.  What the ... ?
 You, fuckoff.
Get your head outta your stinkin' ass and look at me, boy.
 Hey ...
 Get lost.
I have the distinct impression I told you to fuckoff.  Unless I miss my guess, you've just disobeyed an officer of the law.
I am the Law.
You're one butt-ugly son of a bitch and you're about to dead meat.
I am the son of eternal night and you are about to discover pain has no ending.
Oh shh ...
No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.
Curb your tongue.
But I have to see him!  I'm his friend!
Lady, trust me!  You really don't want to go ...
No!  NO!!
 Is there anyone there?  Hello?
How dare you!
I am the Way.
You'll burn in Hell for this!
Burn?  What a limited imagination.
This is my body.  This is my blood. Happy are they who come to my supper.
 Oh God ...
Having fun en route, you bastard.
Oh shit ...
No!
Watch.
The Box can't be destroyed.  Like pain or the poor, it is always with us.  But as long as I have it, no-one can open it.  Now come here and die.  You have friends in Hell waiting to greet you.
You'll have to come and get me, you ugly bastard.
Spirited.  Good.  I'll enjoy making you bleed.  I'll enjoy making you enjoy it.
 Aahhhh!!!
Joey!  Back to the wall, quickly!
Elliott!  No!  What about you?!  Where will you be?!
Back with the damned.  No more hope of heaven.  But I drag this monster back with me!
You stupid interfering foo ... AAAAAH!
Elliott? ... Elliott? ... You can't hear me, can you?  It's 1921.  I'm not really here ...
EMPTY_LINE
Oh, no kiss of welcome after 70 years?
This will be so good, Joey.  You loved him, didn't you?  I can feel him inside, weeping for you.  He can watch through the centuries as we discover the things that make you whimper.
You never met, did you?  This was JP Monroe.
Have you seen what they did to me?  Have you seen what they did?  You interfering little whore!
Terri?  Oh no!  NO!!  TERRI!!
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
Wanna light, you bitch?!
Wait!
You can send me back.  But why?  I can help you, Joey.  I can give you what you want.
You'll never know what I want ...
Respect.  Power.  You and I can put your name on the World's lips, your face on it's screens ...
