Levi turns to a chalkboard on a tripod and writes the word.
Written like this. One word. Small e. Capital X, capital Z. He turns back to face an as-yet-unseen audience.
eXistenZ. It's new, it's from Antenna Research, and it's here, right now. We now see Levi's audience, about seventy-five people, some standing, some sitting on plastic folding chairs. They are of very mixed age and type, but they all cheer and applaud enthusiastically. We are in the central playing area of a small, deconsecrated country church, and Levi performs on a broad, low, carpeted plywood dais. At the far end of the dais, a man and a woman - assistants to Levi - are carefully laying out about two dozen plastic modules that look somewhat like high-tech ski boots.
My name is Wittold Levi, my friends call me Witt - and I'm the project manager for eXistenZ. I recognize some familiar faces - that's all right, that's all right. We won't throw you out. We encourage consumer loyalty, and we want you to help us with our product testing. We're a team, Antenna and you. A delighted stir from the crowd.
Those of you who have come to our invited seminars before will know that I normally lead the group through our new games, but
tonight, it won't be me. No, for the test launch of eXistenZ by Antenna, we have brought you a seminar leader who is rather special. An unbelieving, excited stir. Could it really be?
Yes, it is. The world's greatest game designer is here, in person, to lead you, the first test enclave, through her newest creation, eXistenZ by Antenna... The small crowd is now tremendously excited, wide-eyed, murmuring, one or two have actually gotten on their knees.
I give you, the Game-Pod Goddess herself - Allegra Geller! Levi moves to the edge of the crowd, works his way into it until he has reached a small, unobtrusive figure who up to now has hardly been noticed. She stands next to a security guard who is dressed in a suit and tie but carries an electronic wand of some sort. His name-tag identifies him as Ted Pikul , and we will see more of him later. As Levi takes her hand and gently leads her out of the crowd, her fans applaud softly, touch her hem. They part like water as she passes amongst them, clutching her own personal game-pod case with both hands. She mounts the dais like a blind person led by her seeing-eye dog. Allegra Geller, early thirties, conservatively dressed, is bright, acutely aware, but wary and controlled. When she speaks, she is deliciously, sexily shy, serious, melodic.
The world of games is in a kind of a trance. People are programmed to accept so little, but the possibilities are so great.
But there is no new game to test, at least, not in the usual sense. Confused, slightly disappointed mutterings.
No, no, it's going to be much better than you expected, because eXistenZ is not just a game. It's an entirely new game system. Antenna Research and I developed it together - the eXistenZ System by Antenna - and it involves a whole lot of new toys, which you are going to be the first to try out. The crowd's spirit rises again. Levi steps forward, smiling, playing off the renewed energy.
MetaFlesh. Levi turns to the chalkboard and writes the word.
Written like this. One word. Capital M, capital F. MetaFlesh is what our new toys are made of - the MetaFlesh Game-Pod, only from Antenna Research. It connects with any industry standard bioport, which I know you all have or you wouldn't be here...  .using, however, a very non- standard connecting device which we call... Levi turns again to the chalkboard.
.we call an UmbyCord. Spelled like this. Levi writes the word out and then turns back to his by-now- salivating audience.
I guess you can tell I started off as a schoolteacher.
But I never had anything quite so fun or so revolutionary to teach as what Allegra and I are going to teach you all tonight. With a theatrical flourish, Levi whirls around to face his two assistants, who have finished laying out their devices on the back table and are now standing crisply at attention at either end of it.
Are the MetaFlesh Game-Pods by Antenna Research ready?
And how many of these precious prototypes did we manage to bring with us?
Twenty-one, Mr. Levi. Levi's face clouds slightly. The audience does not hear the following exchange.
The first three we opened were... unhealthy.
Really? Any chance that some of the others...?
We think we're clean.
We have twenty-one prototype MetaFlesh Game-Pods, and that means that for our first wave test enclave we need twenty-one volunteers who will port in these slave units with the Game-Pod Goddess herself... Levi doesn't need to finish his pitch. Every hand is waving in the air, and every pair of lips is saying, "Me, me, oh God, please, let it be me!" Geller can only stand by modestly and beam at the intensity of the small crowd's enthusiasm.
The volunteers watch in hushed reverence, as though about to receive communion. The game-pods are gingerly lifted out of their cases. The UmbyCords are uncoiled and plugged into ports in the back of the game-pods. The shirts, blouses, and jackets of the volunteers are lifted at the back to reveal their owners' bioports, which are small, soft-plastic, flesh-coloured permanent spinal jacks positioned just above the belt line. Twenty-two folding chairs are placed in a circle on the dais. As each volunteer has his UmbyCord plugged into his bioport, he takes one of the seats and places his quivering, rippling game-pod, now connected directly to his nervous system, on his lap.
Hold it. Not so fast. In response, the fan thrusts a card at him. Pikul takes the card, a complex invitation card which includes a holographic photo of the fan under which floats his name, Joel Dichter. Dichter anxiously looks past Pikul into the depths of the church, nervously adjusting the vinyl case slung over his shoulder.
Oh, god. I hope I'm not too late. Did I miss the port-in?
It's just the first wave. You can be part of the second wave.  OK, Joel Dichter. Put your arms up. I have to scan you. Metal and heavy synthetics can't come in.
More for recording devices. Lotta money invested in these games. Industrial espionage happens. What's in this case?
I brought my game-pod. It's got original Marway tissue architecture. It's kind of obsolete but I was hoping,...
even though I couldn't afford the Antenna Fifteen upgrade, I figured out a method of virtual porting that I thought might... Pikul uses his wand to scan the vinyl case, then opens the zipper and feels around. In the case is a more solid, rubbery version of the new MetaFlesh pods.
You won't need it tonight. Everything's provided for. Dichter suddenly spots Geller on the dais. He almost faints.
Migod! Is that who I think it is?
 Yeah, that's her. She's something, isn't she?
But why would a star like her come to a product seminar in a little one-horse town like this?
This is where the real people live, Joel. Her real fans, like you.
Yeah, well, you said it. Just like me. Dichter has scanned OK. Pikul waves him into the church to join the spectators who will form the second wave and re- locks the door. On the dais, in the center of the circle of linked game players, Levi nods at Geller.
Everything's in order. Are you ready, Allegra?
I'm ready to download eXistenZ by Antenna Research into you all now. I'm warning you, it's going to be a wild ride, but don't panic no matter what happens. I'll see you all back here in no time at all. Now the giddy laughter goes a touch nervous, uncertain, but it's too late. Geller depresses a nipple-like protuberance on the game-pod on her lap, and all the players close their eyes and go rigid, like members of a seance who have suddenly been contacted by the spirit world. The pods in their laps begin a rhythmic, peristaltic rippling. At the edge of the crowd, Pikul sidles up to Levi.
She spends most of her time alone in a room designing her games. I think she'd like it best if she never had to show them to anybody.
Really? She doesn't enjoy all the adulation?
She hates having to port in with her fans. It's too intimate.
Then why does she do it?
By "we" you mean, the game company, Antenna Research?
That's what I mean.
Why?
Me? Oh, I'm with your own management training program.  I want to end up in marketing and public relations.  The only thing I know about security is how to switch this thing on.
eXistenZ is a lot more than a game.
Yeah, right, it's a game system. I heard that.
And we're worried that it's too intellectual, too complex, too weird, too artsy. That argument ; never bothers her until she faces her fans. She hates to be rejected in the flesh, so we make her come out sometimes to take the heat.
What are they doing?
Catchy. Levi helps him out, and soon the whole room is humming along happily, warmed by the Antenna Research corporate theme song. The whole room, that is, except for Joel Dichter, who, at the edge of the dais, is more concerned with fumbling around in the vinyl pod-case hanging from his shoulder. In the case, we watch as Dichter tears open his obsolete game-pod to reveal a bizarre weapon, a pistol made of bone and gristle, almost like the half-decayed body of a small mammal - whose snout is the barrel, whose rigid hind leg is the trigger. Dichter takes his weapon out of its case, shakes off a few gelatinous strips of game-pod flesh, and steps up onto the dais. Pikul is the first to notice this. He glances at Levi, who's still blissed out and humming, then launches himself awkwardly through the crowd. Now in the middle of the circle, Dichter makes his way towards the blissfully unsuspecting Geller, raising his weapon as he goes.
Death to eXistenZ! Death to Antenna Research! Death to the demoness Allegra Geller!
Get her out of here! Save her! There might be more of them! Go on!
Me? Me take her?
 We have enemies in our own house. Trust no one. Trust no one... The wide-eyed Pikul scrambles to his feet and promptly trips over the all-but-dead Dichter. He falls painfully to his knees, struggles up again, and finds the bizarre bone gun in his hand. Pikul stares at it, fascinated, horrified. He turns back to Levi, but Levi's eyes are rolling back as he loses consciousness. The two assistants are making their way towards them through the shoving, shuffling throng, guns cocked, faces set hard. Panicked, Pikul jams the bone gun into his suit pocket and jumps off the platform, wildly looking around for Geller. She and her chair have slipped off the dais in a heap only a few feet away, and she is in several kinds of agony. Pikul unports her, which immediately brings her some relief and a lot of clarity. Pikul wards off a couple of fans with one arm, screams at them.
 Yeah, you're coming with me. Pikul pulls her to her feet, but she immediately dives back to the floor to find her game-pod and UmbyCord.
 I can't lose this! I can't lose this! She finds the game-pod still under the folding chair, a bit flattened on one side but in one piece. She grabs the game- pod and its UmbyCord and stuffs them into her MetaFlesh pod case which has been knocked to the edge of the dais. As she clutches it to her, Pikul takes her hand and hauls her through the crowd, which is now spilling off the overcrowded dais and clutching at Geller fitfully, like Velcro. They head for the door, fighting everybody off as though they might be lethal. As they leave through the side door, Pikul sees five or six fans, shrieking like monkeys, still stomping and kicking the body of Dichter viciously, hysterically, while Levi's two assistants carry him to the safety of the church's apse.
Pikul and Geller look around wildly. The vehicles in the parking lot are country, pickup trucks, rusted vans, 4x4s. Across the road, aloof, maybe too high-class for the parking lot, sits a Land Rover Defender 110, the one with the roof cage and the seven seats and the winch hanging off the front. Geller gestures towards the Defender.
Let's take my limo.
Why no?
I don't trust the driver!
You drive, idiot!
What's the commotion, Miss Geller? Say, are you all right? What's goin' on in there?
We need this vehicle, and we need it without you. But with the keys.
I can't do that. I can't abandon my vehicle. Geller pulls the weird gun out of an astonished Pikul's pocket. She points it at Frances.
Get out, Frances. You can say you were hijacked.
 You have to push the shift lever down to get it into reverse.
Thanks, Frances. They drive off down the country road, leaving Frances in the dust.
 I normally like the countryside, don't you? Normally, the country is relaxing and calm.
Only if you don't really know what's going on.
What do you mean?
There is great stress and anger and violence in the countryside. Thousands of life forms all screaming ME ME ME and trying to kill and dominate and devour the other life forms. It's terrifying and exhausting.
That's good, `cause you might end up spending a lot of time here.
I might?
Sure. If you go back home to the city, they'll probably be waiting for you.
They?
Yeah. My assassins. They'd want to have a little talk with you about where I am.
I was hoping that was just one crazy guy.
Did you hear the way he screamed at me? He wasn't alone.
Everybody likes a conspiracy. It's more satisfying than just one crazy guy doing one crazy thing. Geller goes silent.
Well, what are we going to do out here? Do you know your way around? You know any country people?
Not country people. Games people. The countryside's full of games development people, project co- ordinators, little factories - you name it.
That's weird. I never knew that.
The city's full of bad microwaves, bad thermals, bad electro-optics. You can't shield from it anymore. You can't get true readings. The whole industry moved out of the city years ago.
So you know your way around. We can hide out.
Maybe. But it seems I have some enemies I didn't know I had. "Death to Allegra Geller." How'd you like to hear somebody with a gun screaming, "Death to Ted Pikul"?
Wow.  Hey, how'd you know my name?
 You're labelled.
Oh. Yeah.
It has a trigger. I pulled it.
Can I see it?
Later. I think I'm gonna use it in my next game. If there ever is a next game. Pikul glances at her. He hits a pothole and she bounces around in her seat, exposing her far shoulder to him. Her shirt is soaked with blood.
Migod, you're bleeding. I forgot you got hit. There is an urgent buzzing from somewhere in Pikul's breast pocket.
What's that?
It's my pink-fone. I'm not sure I should answer it.
Answer it. Pikul pulls the pink-fone - it's soft surgical plastic, palm-sized - out of his pocket. When he squeezes it open, a diffuse pink light swells up from deep inside it.
What? Can I have my pink-tone back? Geller finds the power button and pushes it. The pink inner light flutters out. She unceremoniously throws the pink-tone out the window. It lands in a rain ditch full of frogs.
That was a rangefinder. As long as you have that, they know where you are.
They? You mean head office?
I mean anybody.
That was Alex Kindred, head of publicity and marketing, at Antenna HQ...
No. Anti-eXistenZialists. Capital X, capital Z. They somehow found out about eXistenZ and they want to kill you for creating it. They say that the eXistenZ game system will "finally destroy reality", or something totally nuts like that.
It makes sense to you? You're not suprised?
I hear things. It's hard to surprise me.
Kindred said that I'm your bodyguard and the company is holding me totally responsible for your safety.
What?
You're not armed. They told me you were my security but you have no weaponry.
Who told you that? I'm just a marketing trainee. My clinic master thought I'd learn something about marketing if I moonlighted as a security guard on one of your test previews.
Fuck. I'm marked for death and they send me on the road with a PR nerd.
 Jesus! Marked for death!
Don't sweat it, Pikul. I'll handle it. We just have to disappear for a while. And right now, we have to stop.
We do? Why?
He grits his teeth and digs in with a bit more gusto. Something yellow and white, like a kernel of corn, flips out of her wound and onto the road's shredding asphalt. Pikul feels around for it, finds it, holds it up to the light.
I got it. Wow. Did somebody bite you?
What do you mean?
What I just dug out of you. It's a tooth. A human tooth. Pikul holds the tooth out to her, but she just glances at it, then rummages around in her MetaFlesh game-pod bag.
Lemme see that weirdo pistol. Geller pulls the strange weapon out of the bag. After a moment of study, she expertly pops the magazine out of the grip. The gristly magazine is packed with teeth.
Yep. The bullets are human teeth. Look - this one's got a cavity.
That thing was designed to get past any kind of metal or synthetics detector. It's all flesh and bone.
I suppose the smaller caliber pistols would have to fire baby teeth. The tooth fairy could go I into the arms business.
The whole gamesworld is in a kind of trance.
Yes. I remember you said that at the church.
People are prepared to accept so little. They're in a'cage formed out of their own limited
expectations. They have no idea what amazing things could be theirs.
Where were you just now? What were you doing?
 I was wandering through eXistenZ - the new system, I mean.  I like it in there. Of course, without another player you're only a tourist. It's frustrating.
Why won't you let me contact Antenna? They've got to be going crazy, wondering what's happened to you. I mean, it's not like we've done something wrong. We just ran because we didn't know how many of them there were, right? I think we owe it to Antenna to let them know you're all right, to get them to send somebody to help you who knows what he's doing... And besides, I can't... I can't just keep doing this, whatever it is, you know, forever, not having any idea when it's going to be... Geller gets up and goes over to Pikul. She pulls up his shirt.
Hey, what are you doing?
Where's your bioport? Don't tell me you were never fitted. I can't believe it. Pikul shrugs his shirt back down, starts tucking it in.
No, I was never fitted with a bioport. What do you care?
You're hoping to get into the biz and you've never played one of my games. You've never played any game. That means you have no idea
Bullshit. Posturing. You don't play my games, you don't work for Antenna Research, I'll make sure of that.
Look, I've been dying to play your games. But I have this - phobia about having my body penetrated - surgically. You know what I mean.
I'm not so sure I do.
Getting a bioport fitted... I dunno. I can't do it. It's too freaky. Makes my skin crawl.
God, c'mon. They just pop your spine with a little hydro-gun. Shoot the port-plug into it. They do it at malls, like getting your ears pierced.
Yeah, sure. With only an infinitesimal chance of permanent spinal paralysis. I've read all about it.
It's your chosen profession, geek. She pauses, then moves very close to him. She breathes her words slowly, intimately, into his ear.
 Well, yeah, of course, but... Let me, uh, let me call Antenna...
 They wouldn't want to talk to you if they knew you had never had a bioport installed. It's company policy, you know. They want you to be passionate about your work.
 My baby here took a huge hit in the church, Pikul. You see how she's quivering? Pikul takes a look. The pod is, in fact, quivering like a terrified hamster.
It... she, yes, she's quivering.
out just as the game architecture was being downloaded from her to all those slave pods... that's a very vulnerable time for her. She could be crying out for help right here, right now.
Let's do it... let's do it now. Let me see.  To get an illegal, unregistered bioport installed at about midnight - we just drive up to your local country gas station, right?
Anything else I can do for you?
Well, Gas, you could check your bioport-plugs.
The what? The sparkplugs?
You heard me. My friend here has a bioport problem.
Sure you do. Gas looks at her closely for the first time. His eyes widen in disbelief. He pulls a greasy wallet out of his overalls and flips out the card holders. Amongst various family photos, hot rod photos, fishing photos, is a photo of Allegra Geller clipped from a glossy magazine. Under the photo is the legend "Genius In A Game-Pod". Gas takes her hand in his and kisses it.
Allegra Geller. You changed my life.
What was your life like before?
Before?
Before it was changed by Allegra Geller.
I operated a gas station.
But you still operate a gas station, don't you?
Only on the most pathetic level of reality. Geller's work liberated me.
Liberated?
Did you ever play her game ArtGod? One word, capital A, capital G?
I don't have a bioport, remember?
"Thou, the player of the game, art God." Very spiritual. Funny, too. God, the artist. The mechanic.  Funny. Gas zips up his fresh overalls.
Not to worry. They way they set things up, you could fire in a bioport in a slaughterhouse and not generate an infection.
Then why the clean overalls?
It's a mental thing. Helps me focus. The one thing you don't want to do is miss with the stud- finder.
Oh, God.
Gas slides open a drawer of his red metal mechanic's rolling toolbox and pulls out a greasy device that looks like a carbon-fibre voltage meter.
We call this thing a stud-finder.' It locates the spot on your spine where the x intersects with the y. We don't want to be even a micron out of whack. That's when you get troubles. It's a little radar/sonar/laser thingee. Marks you with a special range-finding dye.
Never say dye.
Lift up your shirt and turn around.
See, that didn't hurt, did it?
I didn't expect that to hurt. I expect the next part to hurt. Gas pulls the bioport insertion gun out of another drawer, this time a locked wooden one bolted under his metal-topped work bench. It is a scary thing, like a hydraulic jack designed by Giger, only smaller.
Yeah, that's what I expect will hurt.
I've never crippled anyone yet.
How many have you done?
Three. Well, you'll be the third.
What's going on, Gas?
Hell, he's acting like I'm attackin' him. People usually pay me.to do this, you know.
Yeah. All two of them. As you can see, I've decided not to have a bioport installed.
This is it, you see. This is the cage I was talking about, the cage of your own making which keeps you trapped and pacing about in the smallest possible space forever. Break out of your cage, Pikul. Break out now.
That swelling doesn't last for long. Tomorrow, you won't even notice it.
I love it. Great. Pikul tries to get up from the wingback chair and promptly collapses into the arms of Geller and Gas.
The procedure comes with its own epidural, just like when you have a baby. Kinda like instant paralysis from the waist down? That's why it didn't hurt you. It'll wear off in about twenty minutes. As they ease Pikul into a sitting position in the chair, Gas almost drops the insertion gun which he has been holding in one hand. He leans it against the wingback chair, and Pikul notices blood and flecks of skin on Gas's work gloves.
You're looking more like a butcher than a mechanic.
Things do get kinda confused these days, don't they? I'm gonna go wash up. You two make yourselves at home. Gas strides off towards the washroom with an air of great satisfaction. Geller eases her game-pod out of its case and starts to attach its two-player, Y-shaped UmbyCord to it.
What are you doing?
We don't have to wait for the swelling to go down.
You're going to port into me? While I'm paralysed?
You wanted to play my game, didn't you?
Yeah, I did, and I do, but... Here? Now?
It's an instant-on world, isn't it? She lifts up his shirt to reveal the new bioport. It already looks a bit less angry than it did before. Geller caresses it, prods it, plays with it. Then she takes out a little bottle of WD-40 and sprays it around and into the port.
What's that for? It feels cold.
New ports are sometimes a bit tight. Wouldn't want to hurt you.
How come bioports don't get infected? I mean, they open right into your body...
Listen to what you're saying, Pikul. Don't be ludicrous.
Maybe afterwards. Geller gently works her UmbyJack into Pikul's bioport. She locks her eyes onto his, then squeezes her game-pod's ON teat. Instantly, her pod convulses and begins to flash and spark and crackle. White electronic smoke seeps from its crevices and a kind of bioelectronic fat sputters from its pores. Geller leaps up from the arm of the chair and rips her UmbyJack out of Pikul's spine. He can't feel it, but the furious force of her move twists him in his chair.
What do you mean?
I.. I was nervous, but I didn't panic.
You can get a new pod...
 Pikul, in this pod is the only, the original version of eXistenZ, an entire game system that cost thirty-eight million to develop, not including pre-release marketing costs. And I'm locked outside of my own game! I can't get it out, or me in!
Are you serious? This is the only version that exists?
Security is everything these days. It's the only one and its stuck inside and it's your fault. Geller uses her sleeve to clean the drool off the pod with tragic gentleness, as though it were an injured child.
 I've devoted my five most passionate years to this strange little creature. And I've never regretted it, Pikul, because I knew that it was the only thing that could give my life any meaning...
But why is it my fault? I'm telling you, I didn't, I did not neural-surge. I didn't. I didn't feel any surging. Gas strolls into the garage, still wearing his work gloves, which now hold an agricultural-looking shotgun. It is levelled at Geller.
It isn't your fault. It's my fault. Pikul looks at Gas in disbelief. His feet begin to writhe in circles, but he still can't get out of the chair; Geller backs away from Gas, clutching her pod protectively.
I wouldn't try to use that bioport again, `cept maybe for a toaster or something.
What's going on?
You're worth a lot of money. If you're dead.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about. It's all over the countryside. Five million for her dead body. No questions asked.
But, but... she changed your life.
Yup. And now I'm gonna change hers.
Seems there's a big bonus for killing Allegra Geller's latest game, or whatever it is. I think I just did that, didn't I? Geller decides to try another tack. She stops backing away and begins to slowly approach Gas.
But can you kill a person? Can you do that, Gas? Can you kill me? Hide my body. Contact the crazies. Trust them to pay up. Hand over my now-decaying, fucking grotesque corpse. Really expect them to hand over 5 mil cash? Don't you ever go to the fuckin' movies?
I like your script. I want to be in it. Gas cocks his shotgun. He's really going to do it. Except that Pikul shoots him right in the mastoid bone, just behind the ear, with the bioport insertion gun. The back of Gas's skull shatters and he goes down hard. Pikul drops the gun and launches himself out of his chair. He falls to his knees beside Gas's body.
Oh, God, I think he's dead. I thought I could just distract him.
You did distract him.  Plug your toaster into that hole, corpse!
He wanted to kill you.
Yep.
That's two people in one day who wanted to actually kill you.
I've never been more popular.
Allegra, we need help.
You're right. I've got to get this pod fixed.
We're going skiing?
Nothing in the countryside is what it seems. It's all appearance versus reality, and the reality here is something unique.
Look at that huge bug. It's got two heads.
They breed them here. They're not supposed to get away. They get out and walk towards the clubhouse.
What if somebody comes up here and really wants to ski?
Nobody actually physically skis any more, Pikul. You know that.
I've watched some ski shows. Downhill racing, Austrian Alps.
My darling Allegra. I am so pleased to see you here. They embrace.
Kiri Vinokur, this is my bodyguard, Ted Pikul.
Hello, yes, I heard the ridiculous story about this fatwa against you. The company is desperately trying to find you. Is it really serious? Are you in danger?
If I'm her bodyguard, then she's in grave danger.
There have been a couple of attempts on my life already.
I don't know if they can do anything about it. It seems to be open season on me.
Well, you will be safe here, I can assure you of that. I will contact Antenna right away and have them send some people to come and collect you.
Kiri, no, don't. You mustn't let anybody know we're here unless you have to. I can't be sure that Antenna is completely safe for me.
I understand. Yes. The company draws many eccentric people into its fold. You can hide in one of the guest chalets. As long as you like. I will make sure you get fresh towels... Geller pats her game-pod case.
.and make sure I don't lose everything I have in here.
A cherubic middle-aged man - Landry - who looks more like a farmhand than an electronics technician, assists Vinokur as he works.
What did you port into?
Pikul's bioport.
Really? That's what did all the damage?
It was a flawed installation - my first. It... it neural-surged. Allegra says you can fix it.
It fried some very expensive nerve boards. See? Here. These are kaput. It's a complex thing.
Nerve boards?
We use the nervous systems of specially-bred insects to create the electronic circuits on our motherboards.
Wow. And where do the batteries go?
Very funny.
He's not kidding. He's a total PR nerd.
Landry here will finish up the pod-work. Meanwhile...
It hurts. I think it's infected.
It's not infected. It's just excited. It wants action. She attempts to jack her pod into his port using the Y- shaped UmbyCord, but he twists away from her.
But I really don't think that I want action. Me, I mean. The bearer of the excited bioport. What I want is... not now. Not here. I feel too... too exposed. Geller sighs, then switches into her explaining-the-facts- of-life-to-a-child mode. They are both aware that they are replaying an earlier moment.
 My baby here has now taken three major hits, one in the church, one in the gas station, and one on the operating table. The only way I can tell if everything's OK - the game's not been contaminated, the pod's not fucked - is to play eXistenZ with somebody friendly. Are you friendly, or are you not? Pikul swallows nervously, then turns his back to Geller so that she can port in.
You're telling me this thing will run off my body's energy?
All right. eXistenZ. Only from Antenna. Here we go.
You could beat the guy who invented poker, couldn't you? Geller flicks the game-pod nipple, and the chalet begins to melt away around them.
That was beautiful. I feel... just like me. Is that kind of transition normal, a kind of smooth dissolve from place to place?
Depends on the style of the game. You can get jagged, brutal cuts, slow fades, shimmering little morphs...
This is amazing. I had no idea. We... we're still ourselves, but we're in the game. Where are we?
It's basically a game store I used to hang out in as a kid.
We're ported into a game-pod together, remember? eXistenZ has complete access to both our central nervous systems. Its game architecture will be based on our memories, our anxieties, our preoccupations...
You keep saying that.  Look at this. Games I've never heard of. Biological Father. Hit By A Car. Viral Ecstasy. Chinese Restaurant.  In Viral Ecstasy, you are a virus invading a specific human body. You create ingenious viral strategies to cope with the efforts of the body's immune system to destroy you..."
Wait a minute. That reminds me. What precisely is the goal of the game we're playing now? I mean, the rules, the objective... Nobody's ever really said anything about what you have to do in eXistenZ.
The beauty of eXistenZ is that it changes every time you play it. It adapts to the individuals who are actually playing it. The result is that you have to play the game to find out why you're playing the game.
But that's kind of cheating, isn't it? Not to say confusing.
Not at all. It's a much more organic approach to gaming than classic, arbitrary, rule- dominated games. It's the future, Pikul. You'll see how natural it feels.
Suddenly, a hand reaches into the frame and takes the pak away, puts it neatly back on the rack. Pikul and Geller look up at a man in his early fifties, graying, thinning hair, beefy, generally harried and pugnacious air. The man is Dorsey Nader.
These are delicate. You have to be careful.
Yes. I can imagine.
Cortical Systematics is the latest and the hottest. Not just a new game, but a new system.
Will it work with an industry standard bioport?
 I haven't seen you two before, have I? This is my place. Haimische, isn't it? Funky?
We're new in town.
Welcome to Dorsey Nader's Game Emporium. I'm Dorsey Nader. Is there anything I can help you with?
We're just looking.
You do?
Follow me. Nader turns his back on them and walks to the back of the store. He stops at a warped and dirty door, turns, beckons to them urgently, trying not to be noticed by the preoccupied patrons. As Pikul and Geller follow Nader through the door, they do not escape the notice of the sour-faced young cashier, who writes something down hurriedly on a pad with an air of vengeful self-importance.
Oh God, what happened? I didn't mean to say that!
But should you be saying that in front of him? Nader?
Look at him. Pikul does. Nader doesn't seem to have heard him. In fact, he doesn't respond at all other than to hum the Antenna Research corporate-song and tap his fingers repetitively, caught in a small behavioural loop. Geller chuckles at Pikul's confusion.
He's gone into a game loop, he's locked up, and he won't come out of it until you give him a proper game line of dialogue.
This is tricky.
Start by repeating your last line. Include his name so he knows you're talking.to him.
We're here, Dorsey Nader, and that's all that matters. Nader immediately comes out of his loop. He chuckles.
You're right. That is all tha matters. Pikul smiles, delighted. Now he takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, relaxes. The line comes.
Well, Nader, you said you had what we want. We're waiting.
You're going to need these micro- pods to download your new identities. I assume that you both have had those industry standard bioports you mentioned installed.
Yes, of course, that's right. We both have bioports. Here she pauses, looks at Pikul.
We do, don't we?
I assumed we did. I mean, here. In the game. Of course, we might not.
We'd better check. While Nader goes into game lock-up, Geller lifts up her shirt. Pikul takes a look. Her bioport is there, although slightly rougher, puckered, more organic than in non-game life.
Yeah, it's there. Looks a little different, but it's there. Geller grabs Pikul's shirt and lifts it. His is there too.
I see what you mean.
I'm going to leave while you finish up here. It wouldn't be good for us all to be seen together. Nader gets up to leave, pauses at the door.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Nader chuckles a very theatrical chuckle, then leaves.
I assume that Nader is our entry point into the game.
Yeah. Kinda disappointing.
Nader?
Yeah. Not a very well-drawn character. And his dialogue was just so-so.
Yeah.
The game engine is just getting used to us. It'll get more daring once it warms up.
OK. The pods are so small they plug directly into the bioport. Geller delicately twists the end of the micro-pod into Pikul's bioport. The micro-pod changes colour, pulses, ripples, and then slowly flows and wriggles its way into Pikul's bioport until it has completely disappeared.
God!
What happened?
The whole pod just disappeared into your back.
Don't panic, it's just a game. Do you feel anything yet?
 No, I don't. Not a thing. I don't feel a thing. Uh, do you want me to do you? They change positions. Pikul ports in the micro-pod and it duly crawls its way into Geller's bioport. Tenderly, as though kissing a cut to make it better, Pikul kisses her back, low near her bioport. Geller whirls around with sudden anger.
What the hell was that?
You're right. Our characters are obviously supposed to jump on each other. Probably to create emotional tension when danger happens. No use fighting it.
Your what?
I mean, where are our real bodies? Are they all right? Are they hungry? What if there's danger?
(kissing and caressing
They're just where we left them, sitting quietly, eyes closed. Just like meditating.
(reluctantly kissing and
I don't know. I feel really vulnerable. Disembodied.
Don't sweat it. All your senses are still operating. You'll pop right out of the game if there's a problem. They begin to make seriously hot love amrngst the game paks and cartons of replacement UmbyCords. And then the game store melts away around them.
Tryin' to remember who you are? Pikul snaps his head up to see a long-haired, morose-looking worker sitting next to him, snickering. Mocking Pikul, he twists his own card around, comically bunching up his work shirt so he can read his own name, which is YEVGENY NOURISH.
Hey, it works! I must be Yevgeny Nourish! Nourish leans over to squint at Pikul's name tag.
And you... you are new to the Trout Farm.
Yes. I... I'm... very new. Did you say trout farm?
You know - raise baby trout from eggs and then stock the rivers with them.
I You might be new but you seem to know what you're doing.
I, ah... I've been trained by the very best. Nourish unlocks and looks around with a delicate furtiveness.
I'm new here. I have no plans for lunch.
I suggest the Chinese restaurant in the forest. Everybody knows where it is. Just ask.
Won't you be going there too?
I have other plans for lunch. But I do suggest that you order the special. And don't take no for an answer.
All right, I'll do that. Nourish turns back to his task and begins to work away as though Pikul didn't exist. Pikul takes this cue to go back to his own board and is soon preoccupied with testing the board's circuits by porting it into a test UmbyCord that uncoils from the center of the bench. His strange reverie, watching himself work on auto- pilot at this bizarre task, is soon interrupted by a worker pushing a canvas and metal cart with bicycle wheels. The worker parks the cart behind Pikul and taps him on the shoulder.
Larry?
They need this in the back room. They asked for you. The worker shuffles off, leaving the cart behind him. Pikul turns to Nourish.
What's that mean?
Should I just get up and go there?
Yeah. I'll take care of your incoming boards. Pikul gets up to go. Nourish grabs him by the arm and whispers intensely.
Remember. The Chinese restaurant for lunch.
I order the special.
The bays themselves are old horse stalls with straw still covering the dirt floors. But because the pods are primarily organic, the teams are more like groups of masked surgical workers in a series of impossibly small and filthy operating rooms than, let's say, auto-assembly teams in a progressive Saab plant. As Pikul wheels his cart past each stall, he digs into the cart's canvas bag and delivers insect boards wrapped in brown wax paper to the eagerly awaiting pod teams. In the last bay, one of the masked surgeons grabs him by the hand instead of taking the proferred motherboard pnd leads himm to an isolated corner. Her ID card says she is BARB BRECKEN, and her photo says she is Geller.
 I saw you make contact, Larry Ashen. What did the guy on the .l assembly line say to you? Pikul's expression shows that there is a return game line welling up in his mouth, tickling his tongue, perhaps. Perversely, he fights it, but it comes out anyway.
He told me where to have lunch.
We have nice sea bass today. Shall I bring it for everyone? Pikul and Geller exchange a look. Pikul shrugs OK.
We want the special. The waiter looks stunned. The others at their table look distressed. The waiter seems to lock up, almost freeze- framed.
Did you hear me, Chinese waiter?
The special is for special occasions. I cannot give you the special.
But this is a special occasion. It's... Pikul pauses, waiting for the proper game line to materialize in his mouth. Finally, it does. He gestures towards Geller.
It's her birthday. The waiter locks up for a moment, then unfreezes.
A birthday is a special occasion. I will therefore bring the special for everybody. The waiter walks away. The others at the table get up and move away, drift over to other tables with occasional furtive backward glances at Pikul and Geller.
I guess the special isn't very popular.
I guess.
But you know, really, don't you? You don't have to guess. I mean, it's your game, your little universe.
I don't know. You have to understand that, to understand what we've really created with eXistenZ.
You're telling me, for example, that you don't know what the special is?
Correct. I don't.
Or why we ordered it.
We ordered it because another game character told you to. That's a clue we can't ignore. But that's just basic games playing.
I want to put the game on pause. Geller just looks at him, puzzled. Pikul panics.
Sure, yeah, but why? What's wrong? Aren't you dying to see what's special about the special?
I'm feeling a little disconnected from my real life. I'm kind of losing touch with the texture of it, you know what I mean? I mean, I actually think there's an element of psychosis involved here. I mean, I don't know where my body really is, or where reality is, what I've actually done, or not done.
That's a great sign. It means your nervous system is fully engaging with the game architecture. The game is a lot more fun when it starts to feel realer than real.
Did I do that? I guess I did.
So how does it feel?
What?
Your real life. The one you came back for.
Just sitting here, it feels completely unreal. I'm sure you knew that would happen.
You're stuck now, aren't you? You want to go back to the Chinese restaurant because there's nothing happening here. We're safe. It's boring.
Worse than that. I'm not sure here, where we are, is real at all. This feels like the game. And you... you're beginning to t1 feel a bit like a game character to me.
It feels like we did.
Our characters did. I'm sure it would be very different if we did.
I... I'm actually just like that in real life. You got the real Ted Pikul there, in the stockroom of the game store.
Well, you didn't get the real Allegra Geller, I can tell you that. no
I didn't? She kisses him gently.
No. In real life I tend to lose control. It can get messy.
Special order for the birthday girl. Hope you enjoy it very much. In the dishes are a variety of cooked reptiles, amphibians, fish and birds, all weirdly mutated and presented in a bizarrely beautiful fashion.
I think I've lost my appetite.
A shame. Mutant creatures provide new and previously unimagined taste sensations.
No, it looks terrific. Thank you. We're happy. The waiter nods.
Very good. Enjoy. The waiter leaves. Geller watches him go, suspicious. When she turns back to Pikul, she is shocked to see that he has served out most of the creatures to himself and is avidly stripping the meat off their bones.
Pikul, what are you doing?
I don't know. I find this disgusting but I can't help myself.
Oh, good! Pikul looks up from his big bowl, which is rapidly filling with creature parts. His fingers are'slimy and sticky, but he doesn't stop, his fingers working expertly on their own.
Good? You think this is good?
Yeah. It's a genuine game urge. It's something that your game character was born to do. Don't fight it.
I am fighting it, but it isn't doing me any good. Pikul is now snapping together bits and pieces of bone, gristle and flesh, a grotesque Lego set. When he's finished, he's made a gun very much like the one that was used in the attempted assassination in the church.
Omigod, this looks awfully familiar. You sure this is OK?
Do you have that bridge in real life?
Absolutely not. My teeth are perfect. Don't ask me how I knew this thing was in my mouth.
It probably wasn't until you ordered the special. He slaps the magazine into the handle, then pulls the slide back and releases it so that there is now a toothy round in the chamber. Then with a smile, Pikul points the weapon at Geller.
 That's not funny!
Sorry, I couldn't resist. But you know... I do feel the urge to kill someone here. Geller grips the edge of her bowl of hot-and-sour soup - the handiest weapon she has.
I need to kill our waiter.
But everything in this game is so realistic. I don't think I really could...
You won't be able to stop. You might as well enjoy it.
"Free will" is obviously not a big factor in this little world of ours.
It's like real life - there's just enough to make it interesting. - Pikul spots the waiter making his way across the room towards them, a big smile on his face.
He's too nice. I won't do it. The waiter arrives at their table.
What can I do to make your lunch more pleasant? Pikul lifts the gun and points it at the waiter.
I found this in my soup and I'm very upset. Pikul fires. The tooth-bullet hits the waiter in the cheekbone. A chunk of the waiter's cheekbone comes off and his head jerks back like a fighter taking a stiff jab. The waiter's sweet face instantly transforms into a hideous, angry, snarling mask of hatred. He pulls a meat cleaver out of his jacket. Geller immediately throws her bowl of hot-and-sour soup into the waiter's face. The waiter screams, then wildly wipes the noodles and goop out of his eyes. He raises the cleaver over his head. The waiter swings and lunges across the table, managing only to hack the tip of the gun off. Pikul is shocked to see the gun begin to bleed. The waiter, sprawling across the table, screams as he tries to reach Geller with his cleaver. Pikul
 St's all right, just a little misunderstanding over the check. Pay no attention and enjoy your meal. To his surprise, the patrons actually turn back to their meals, albeit with a certain sinister reluctance. Pikul looks around wildly.
I feel a serious game urge to get out of here! Through the porthole in one of the pair of metal-clad kitchen doors, Geller spots someone wearing a che'f's hat, someone who is wildly beckoning to them.
Through the kitchen! That way!
Did you like the meal I prepared for you?
Yes. It was very... revealing.
It certainly was for me. You both passed our little test with flying colours.
Why did the Chinese waiter have to die?
A waiter hears many things spoken when people are relaxed and eating. A waiter has many opportunities for betrayal.
He betrayed you?
He betrayed us. Out this way, quickly!
See there, the breeding pools. The pools are all alive with strange creatures, mutated fish, amphibians, and, along the small, muddy terraces that border the pools, reptiles. Like the dysfunctional insect at the gas station, these creatures do not work very well. They float and swim belly up, lie on their sides at the bottom of their pools, flop and flounder around, and in general, ostentatiously fail to function.
Is that where you caught today's special?
The Trout Farm is owned by Cortical Systematics?
Yes.
The game made me do it.
I'm impressed. Nourish is also impressed. He smiles broadly, then takes Pikul in his arms and hugs him, then Geller.
"Enemies of Reality"? Or does it really mean, enemies of eXistenZ? Are the Realists the game-life version of the Anti- eXistenZialists, desperately want to kill you?
I wouldn't take it too seriously.
Of course you wouldn't. But maybe you should.
We saw it everywhere in Dorsey Nader's game store, remember?
Yes. So that makes it the game- life version of our own company. Cortical Systematics is equivalent to Antenna Research in the real world.
That's probably fair to say.
So, then, do we meekly go back to work and say nothing? It sounds as though Nourish and his Realists are preparing to sabotage the Trout Farm. Before you know it, they'll be planning to assassinate game designers.
We're just characters in here. Don't mix your real-life loyalties into it or you'll lose for sure.
Then what do we do next?
I'm looking for Dorsey Nader. Is he here?
Say that again?
Is Dorsey Nader here? The cashier glances around the store, then locks the register.
Come with me. He's in the back. The cashier leads them through the store towards the stockroom door. As they move amongst the customers, both Pikul and Geller feel that they are being scutinized carefully by shoppers who turn their eyes away from them at the last moment, so that they can't be absolutely certain. And as for us - have we glimpsed some characters from the game that we have already seen? Possibly even Wittold Levi from the first scene in the church, and Frances the limo driver, and Gas? We aren't positive.
You want him, there he is. Nader lies dead, the unnatural purple of his face eerily matched by the veiny purple streaks in the UmbyCord around his neck.
Migod!
What happened? In response, the cashier starts rummaging around on one of the shelves. He soon finds what he was looking for, and turns around to face them. In his hand is a grotesque, slightly chewed gristle gun - the one Pikul assembled in the Chinese restaurant - in his hand.
You shouldn't have killed the Chinese waiter.
Why not?
He was your contact at the Trout Farm. A damn good man.  His dog brought me this. The cashier toys with the gun's claw-like hammer.
But we were contacted there by Yevgeny Nourish. He seemed to know exactly who we were.
That's because Nader tipped him off that you were coming. Nader was a mole for Cortical Systematics.
You're with the Realist underground.
Yes. I was placed here to keep an eye on Nader. The cashier puts the gun back on the shelf.
If Nourish isn't our real contact, who is he?
Nourish is a double agent for Cortical Systematics. He was working with Nader to subvert the Realist cause, and doing it rather well.
We are?
I assume that you both have had spinal port inserts, bioports, installed.
We do.
Are you trying to talk us into having them removed?
No, no. In fact, you would be useless to us without them. We Realists are forbidden to have them, and so we have to use people like you on occasion.
I don't understand. Are you wanting us to jack a game into our bioports?
Game? No. Not a game. A weapon.  You go back to the Trout Farm, and in a familiar place, you find a mouldy old wicker basket with a thread-bare canvas cover.
How will we know what to do?
 Even a child would know what to do. Someone begins to knock loudly on a door very near by. The cashier is oblivious, but'both Pikul and Geller hear it. The stockroom begins to morph away as its objects are replaced one at a time by chalet objects.
Sorry to interrupt you kids, but I thought you'd better have something to eat. We knocked on your door a few times to invite you to dinner... Pikul and Geller sit on the bed, game-pod between them, UmbyCord joining them to each other and to the pod. They look at each other. Pikul shrugs.
Come on in. The door opens slowly to reveal Vinokur, who stands there uncertainly, holding a large tray.
..and when we got no answer, I figured you were playing eXistenZ to try out your new pod, and your new bioport. Everything's all right, I take it? An awkward moment, as though Vinokur has caught the pair having illicit sex. Vinokur moves into the room towards the table.
Can I leave this here for you? Don't bother unporting. I just had to be sure our star designer was in a good place and that she'd recovered her multi- million-dollar game system from her defective pod. Vinokur puts down the tray, which holds several plates covered by smaller, inverted plates to keep the food warm.
Thanks so much, Kiri. This is very sweet of you.
Has what?
Recovered. eXistenZ.
Oh, yes, sure. That's why we're so spaced out.
Yeah, we were. And it's amazing.
Well, that's a relief. I'll leave you two alone. You can leave the tray outside your door when you're finished.
What is that you've brought?
Believe it or not, it's Chinese food. There's a great Chinese restaurant on the other side of the escarpment road. Vinokur turns to go.
Kiri?
Yes?
Have you heard anything yet? I mean, about the eXistenZ test seminar and the shooting?
Oh, yes. It's come over all the media now. You've never been more famous. Your face is everywhere, which of course just.makes it worse. I... 
What? Tell me.
They've announced the possibility that Antenna will delay the release of your new system indefinitely, until they can determine how widespread support for this fanatical group really is. I don't approve, myself. I don't think we should bend one degree to extremists.
Support for the fanatics? What does that mean?
Well, you know. They're all coming out of the woodwork now.
Who is?
 A lot of people are taking the opportunity to jump on the anti- game bandwagon. They've now heard rumours about what the eXistenZ system is, and they say we've gone too far psychologically, medically, socially, you name it. And I'm afraid I wouldn't put it past our competitors to be involved in this, to try to whip up public opinion and kill our new system before it gets born.
(gesturing towards the
Your friend Vinokur is getting shaky. I think he's going to turn, you in to Antenna.
Sounds like you might approve of that.
It might be the safest thing. Are you hungry?
Are you kidding?
Me neither. I'm terrified to look under the plates.
We can't stop. I've been noticing some new... glitches. I'm not sure what they mean. I'm not sure the game is OK.
Will it?
It really will do that, yes.
Allegra, I'm worried that your game will wipe me off the face of the earth. I'm thinking I was right never to have a bioport installed.
 But you have one now. And you're ported in. She mischievously flicks the pod nipple, and the chalet melts away around them.
That was cruel. I don't want to be here.
It wasn't cruel, it was desperate. C'mon, Pikul. You've just got a bad case of first-time user anxiety.
I don't like it here. I don't know what's going on. We're blundering around together in this unformed world, whose rules and objectives are largely unknown, seemingly indecipherable, or even Possibly non-existent, always on the verge of being killed by forces we don't understand.
That sounds like my game, all right. They are now close enough to the security cubicle'at the end of the corridor to see the workers ahead of them being frisked by hand, then scanned by a wand similar to the one that Pikul used at the church.
That sounds like a game that's not going to be easy to market.
The cashier said it would be in a familiar place. Is there such a thing here?
My assembly bay. They make their way to the last assembly bay and slip inside it. There is, for the moment, nobody else there, but several pods have been left on the work tables half-assembled. Pikul spots it first, in the far corner: a large, mouldy wicker basket in the opposite corner. Something lumpy in it is covered by a thread-bare canvas sheet.
Is that it over there? They stroll over to the basket. Geller kneels down and carefully begins to unwrap it while Pikul stands guard.
I'd say it's exactly as advertised. The final wrap comes off. In the basket is a necrotic, purpled, very diseased-looking pod.
God, it's ugly. Even for a game- pod.
 Oh, sure. Yes. Desperate to port into it. Geller steps over to a bunch of UmbyCords draped over a peg and strips one off. She sits down on a rotting wooden folding chair next to the death-pod's basket and ports in one end of the UmbyCord.
Here we go. Wanna give me a hand?
 Exactly. Help me. Pikul kneels beside her as she pulls up her shirt to reveal her bioport. Geller hands him the free end of the UmbyCord and he ports it into her.
How long does it take for the infection to take hold?
No time at all.
And then you quietly port into all the other pods and spread the infection to them...
 Oh, God!
What's happening?
Something's wrong!
 0, God, don't! That really hurts! Pikul lets go. The death-pod, triggered off by Pikul's attempt to disconnect Geller, now begins to convulse in peristaltic waves in its wicker basket. Pikul looks around desperately and spots a clutch of tools hanging from nails on the wall.
No, don't, I'm afraid! But Pikul seizes a crude linoleum knife used for trimming oversized motherboards and, with three erratic slashes at the quivering UmbyCord, hacks her loose. Blood immediately pours out of both ends of the severed cord.
 Pikul. I'm bleeding to death.
Panic-stricken, Pikul steps on Geller's end of the cord to stop the bleeding. It seems to work, but Geller moans horribly.
I know what to do. Pikul twists awkwardly around to see Yevgeny Nourish standing just behind him. He is in the process of slipping a large propane torch off its wall hook.
I know exactly what to do. Nourish unscrews the gas valve and ignites the torch.
Death to Realism! Nourish turns the blazing torch on the pod in the basket. Where the cone of flame hits the pod, it begins to shrivel, crackle, sputter fat. The pod itself tries to ripple away from the searing flame as though it were alive. Nourish laughs and begins to play the cone over the entire surface of the pod. Geller sinks to the ground in exhaustion, holds on to Pikul's leg. The death-pod now swells and bubbles under the torch's flame, then explodes with a dull whump.
Gathering up her last shreds of energy, Geller suddenly shoves a startled Pikul off her cord and picks up the linoleum knife from where Pikul dropped it. Trailing her bloody cord, she lunges at Nourishi driving the rusty, curved blade into his back with great force. Nourish turns to Geller, the torch circling towards her, wavering. He tries to touch her with the flame, staggers.
Death to who?  Oh, yeah... Barb... Nourish drops the torch, falls to the ground and snaps into the foetal position. A wall of flame roars up around him, fueled by the straw, wood, canvas, pod-oils. Pikul jumps over to Geller and picks up the trailing cord, twists it in his hands until it stops bleeding. All four walls of the assembly bay are on fire now. The doorway is a flapping sheet of flame. Mixing with the swelling rush of the flame are the sounds of the entire plant going on alert: yells, screams, sirens, running feet, doors being slammed open and closed. Pikul holds Geller tightly. She is limp, weak, drained in his arms.
I think we just lost the game. But now, strange, anomalous objects begin to appear out a nowhere in the flames - a chair, a tv set, a bath tub, a table, objects emerging into the game from the quest chalet. After a moment's confusion, Pikul smiles.
Or maybe not. And sure enough, the Trout Farm and its flames and its black cloud melt away.
Allegra, we're back home. What's the matter, what's wrong? As Geller swims back up into full consciousness, she begins to talk, mumbling at first, then with terrible clarity.
Brought what back? I can't understand what you're saying.
Oh God, I'm really going to lose it, I'm going to lose my game! Unport me! C'mon, unport me! Pikul unports her, then begins to tug at his own jack. When he takes a close look at the pod, he can see that it looks - unhealthy. Geller jumps off the bed and yanks open her bag on the table. She pulls out a tiny hypodermic syringe, unwraps it, flicks the bubbles out of it, falls to her knees beside the bed.
But this can't be possible. How can a game event emerge into real life?
What's in that needle?
It's an anti-viral serum. It sometimes works if you get it in time. Unconsciously, Pikul scratches at his bioport. Geller fixes on him with strange intensity.
Lemme see your bioport.
What?
Lemme see it! Pikul turns and shows it to her. She begins to examine it with microscopic, clinical attention.
I know what happened. It's Vinokur, that bastard.
Vinokur?
He gave you a new bioport, didn't he?
Oh, no.
He gave you an infected bioport so that my pod would die and so would my game-system.
I'm infected? Wait a minute!
The theme of disease? I'm fucking reall infected! Is it going to crawl up my spine and rot my brain?
 All right, don't panic. I've got something that will help you. Brusquely wiping away her tears, Geller goes over to her bag and takes out a cork-shaped plastic capsule. She snaps open the capsule to reveal a knurled, plug-like electronic device.
I'm going to seal up your bioport with this anti-viral resonator. Geller bends over Pikul and works the device into his bioport until it's flush with his skin.
 It uses the Umby pick-ups for power. Should cleanse all your porting channels of infection in a few hours. It'11 give you a little skin buzz when it's done. Of course, we can't play until then.
 Yeah, great. Now, listen. This could be critical. Were you really saying that Vinokur is an
agent of the Anti- eXistenZialists? Because if he is, if he's with them, then we are really...
I don't know! I don't know! The cashier strides into the room and pulls her to her feet. She tries to pick up her pod, but the cashier tugs her away from it.
Leave that rotting piece of meat here. It's done its job. Let it die.
But my game! My game's inside it. I don't want my game to die. The cashier unslings his submachine gun, cocks it, and blows the pod into streaks of slime, flesh, and slivers of insect- board. Geller is in shock. Pikul turns her to face him, speaks' forcefully right into her face, shuts everything else out.
Allegra, listen to me. I think we're still inside the game. I think your real pod's out there somewhere, somewhere safe. I think it's OK to let go of this one, this pod. It's not the real one. A Molotov cocktail comes sailing into the room and shatters against the bed. The bed ignites with an explosive whump.
Everybody out! now! The three of them scramble out into the fiery night.
Up here. We can see everything from here.
What is it that we're seeing?
There's just one more thing.
Oh, Y93.' We know who you are. You can't hide inside a game forever.
Something's slipped over the edge, here, Allegra. Something's all wrong.
The cashier raises his gun to fire at Geller, but before he can pull the trigger, he jolts backwards and falls twitching to the ground. From the shadows of the trees, backlit by the fiery landscape below, steps Kiri Vinokur. In his hand he holds the gristle gun which Pikul assembled in the Chinese restaurant.
I tried to find you. Thank God I got here in time.  My dog brought me this.
You copied eXistenZ?
 Allegra, come over to Cortical Systematics. Yes, yes, Cortical Systematics. I'm defecting and so are all the Antenna Research top brass, Pellatt, Melzack, Sherrin, everybody good.
You're a spy for Cortical Systematics.
Not a spy, exactly. I think of myself as a personnel exchange engineer. If you want to be reunited with your creation, you'll come over to us. eXistenZ, by Allegra Geller. Only from Cortical Systematics.
But why stay with them? Look at that mess down there. How could you trust Antenna again, when they've endangered you like this? Geller seems to have lost the thread. She wanders over to the cashier's body and disentangles his submachine gun from him.
 You know, this guy was actually going to kill me. Vinokur looks to Pikul for support.
What the fuck are you doing?! You've killed him! Are you gonna kill me next?
He was only a game character.
 Huh? If... if we... we're not?
Why?
 It wasn't an accident that you and I ended up on the run together.
Not an accident? Pikul hefts the submachine gun in his hands.
No.
I still am one of them.
But you have a bioport now.
I made the bioport sacrifice to get close to you, to make love to my enemy.
Why would you do that?
To understand what I have to kill.
Understand that I suspected who you were from the moment you made that fake phone call to yourself in the limo. Understand that I knew you were my real assassin when you pointed the gun at me in the Chinese restaurant. She flicks up a safety cover on the remote's tip, revealing a toggle switch. Pikul's hands tense around the submachine gun.
And understand that you're dead. Geller flips the toggle switch. The base of Pikul's spine blows out, his shirt billowing with blood as his bioport explodes.
A delighted Geller dances to her feet as Pikul staggers backwards.
 Have I won the game? Have I won? Have I won? The hill, the trees, the flames melt down around her.
Geller is sitting in her chair on the dais as before, her eyes just beginning to flutter open. But Pikul is sitting next to her, also playing the game. And next to him is Nourish, whom we are even more surprised to see in this context. Aad in fact, the players who are sitting in the circle of chairs on the dais are all characters who have been in the movie up to this point: Nader, the cashier, Dichter, Gas, Vinkokur, even Frances, the limo driver. The players are all emerging from a game that has just ended - the movie we have been watching - and they begin to stir in their game gear, which is nothing like the organic pod- technology we have just seen. On the contrary, the garners are wearing head-gear with electrodes, more like normal clunky Virtual-Reality equipment, and are linked by mundane wires. In their laps they hold, not game-pods, but sleek plastic game modules, each about the size of a walkman, with holes into Which I their left thumbs are inserted - a simpler and cruder version of the bioports we have become used to.
Also monitoring the action are a woman, Merle, who is the game's actual project manager - the real-life version of the game-character Levi - and her two assistants. There is a collective sigh as the game finally releases the players, and now they are free to remove their thumbs from the game modules and slide their head-gear off. The two assistants - the real-life ones are both matronly women - begin to help everyone unplug, neatly gathering up the equipment in padded bags as they go. A broadly smiling Merle mounts the dais and stands in the centre of the ring of players.
Are you all back? The man whom we knew in the game as Yevgeny Nourish immediately stands and takes charge. But it is a different Nourish, exuberant, sensitive and artistic.
We're back, Merle. Although I have a feeling some of our crew might not realize it yet. Shaky laughter from some of the players. Throughout the following round of comments from the garners, whom we now realize have been, up to now, playing characters in a game, we hear nothing from Pikul and Geller. These two, who sit next to each other and are now holding hands, remain enigmatically silent.
Wow. Anybody here want a bowl of hot and sour soup?
I will, if you make sure there
rice.
How long were we gone?
About twenty minutes.
It seemed like days. That's fantastic.
Yeah. If you stayed in the gameworld for most of your life, you could live to be five hundred years old!
The twists and turns at the end made my head spin. Maybe there were too many, to fast to absorb.  Hey, but you two were fantastic. You guys are game divas! I think you both deserved to win. There is general agreement amongst the garners about this compliment to Pikul and Geller. The pair just smile sweetly and bob their heads modestly at the smattering of applause.
 Well me, I was really bummed out at first. I got knocked out of the game so soon. It was fun to watch the rest, though. I liked that part where the ones who got knocked out of the game early got to be spooky customers in the game store.
But you were so wonderfully bad. So scary and crazy. I had a lot to do in that first scene in the church but I thought my character was kind of boring.
Well, you know, I'm a gas-jockey in real life, so I was kind of disappointed that I was basically the same thing in the game. A little more fantasy, there, fellers.
 Can I keep this? I've never felt anything like it! And I love this little thumb-hole. It's fantastic! (appreciative laughs and
Remember - it's written like this. Capital T, capital Z. TranscendenZ. It's new, it's from Pilgrimage - capital P. capital I, and it's coming soon.
well, let me first say that I'm kinda glad I lost this game. I don't usually play such nasty characters.
I guess you all could tell that Ted and I had a relationship prior to our coming here. We really do like to play together.
 We do, but I'd like to assure everybody here that Allegra wouldn't really jump into bed with a security guard unless he was me. (laughs from the security
Merle holds out her hand in a gesture of appreciation towards Nourish.
Well, what do we say to our brilliant, award-winning game designer, Yevgeny Nourish? Does he have another winner on his hands or not?
Wild applause from all garners, including Geller and Pikul.
All right, now, I have to ask you some questions, before the game half-life wears off. First, let me thank you for taking part in this test seminar. PilgrImage wants to deliver nothing but the finest to the game enthusiast, and you have all been a proud part of that process tonight. When we've collected all the head-sets and game modules, we'll be handing out a questionnaire to each of you, and I'd like your answers to the questions to be as honest, as brutal, as clear as you can make them. Don't hold back. After that, we're going to form a focus group where we'll discuss details of each of your experiences playing TranscendenZ. You've all had different but interlocking lives in the game, and I think you'll be amazed when you hear each other's stories.
What do you mean?
It had a very strong, very real anti-game theme. I mean, it began with the assassination of a game designer.
or Really? But that's very creative.
It sure didn't come from me. The tone of it in the game was very, very passionate, fanatical. And the atmosphere of paranoia and betrayal was overwhelming. The whole thing felt unstable, dangerous, volatile. But worse than that, there was a kind of industrial espionage subplot. Stealing game-systems, jumping ship from one game company to another. That kind of thing. They both reflexively begin to scan the gaming group, who are all innocently dealing with their question cards.
So which one of them did these elements come from?
Let's probe it when we do the focus group. I think we might have been infiltrated here, and if we have, we've got a big security problem. Pikul and'Geller, questionnaires in hand, wander over to the wary Nourish and Merle. Pikul is now leading the dog that the security guard was holding for him earlier on, the model for the game dog in the Chinese restaurant.
Hi. We were just wondering if we could ask Mr. Nourish a question, away from all the others.
Sure. Shoot.
Well, thank you so much.
Yes. Don't you think the world's greatest game artist ought to be punished for the most effective deforming of reality?
Boys? Could you come over here - right now! But it's too late. Geller reaches down and pulls a flap of false fur and skin away from the dog to reveal two semi- automatic pistols strapped to the dog's flank. Pikul and Geller grab the guns, pull back the slides, and cooly execute Merle and Nourish, who bump grotesquely together as they slump to the ground. In the stunned silence that follows, only the clatter of the last few shells bouncing around on the hardwood floor can be heard. Pikul and Geller glance at each other,. pumped, then fill the silence.
They ignore the waiter, but stop to wait for Pikul's dog to trot calmly past them, heading for the door. Now Pikul and Geller are just about to turn and follow the dog when the waiter unfreezes and takes a step away from the pillar towards them. They immediately swing their pistols over towards him. The waiter stops and raises his hands.
No, wait, you don't have to shoot me. I just wanted to ask you a question. _
