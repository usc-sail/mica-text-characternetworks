      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?</utterance>
   <speaker>CHANCE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.</utterance>
   <speaker>FRANKLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>... Joe? Who's Joe?</utterance>

      <utterance>... I'd like to offer the decent 'Gardeners' of the business community a helping hand.

      <context>The audience applauds Chance's apparent metaphor. Dupont waits for it all to subside, then asks another question.</context>
      <utterance>Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation...

   <speaker>CHANCE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

   <speaker>SKRAPINOV</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right?

      <utterance>And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!  How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!</utterance>

      <utterance>There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.</utterance>

      <utterance>Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.</utterance>
   <speaker>SKRAPINOV</speaker>

      <utterance>Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'</utterance>

      <utterance>I initially came in contact with the Rand name in 1943. 1 was a young lieutenant in the Air Corps, a navigator flying missions over Europe.

Benjamin Rand was an industrial giant, known to be powerful and uncompromising, and yet, on a personal level, we have all felt his warmth and humor...  ... I would like to share with you a few quotes, and a few feelings from our dear friend.  ... 'I do not regret having political differences with men that I respect; I do regret, however, that our philosophies kept us apart.' ... 'I have no use for those on welfare, no patience whatsoever... But, if I am to be honest with myself, I must admit that they have no use for me, either.' ... 'I was born into a position of extreme wealth, I have spent many sleepless nights thinking about extreme poverty - I do not know the feelings of being poor, and that is not to know the feelings of the majority of people in this world. For a man in my position, that is inexcusable.' 'Life is a state of mind.' ... 'When I was a boy, I was told that the Lord fashioned us from his own image. That's when I decided to manufacture mirrors.'</utterance>
