An attack. Screams all over, a half-second of confusion before we SEE it's a large BLACK BEAR jumping out of the darkness, right at Hector. Hector dives out of its path. Screams, panic, shouting, as the bear rears up on his hind legs. Seemingly about to lunge when... exploding out of the water the giant jaws of a crocodile. In a flash instant, the beast engulfs the bear, twisting it, slamming it on the ground and then pulling it into the water. The bear fights back ferociously for a second but there can only be one outcome here. In a matter of seconds, both bear and crocodile have vanished. And the water is calm again.</context>

      <utterance>There's no triumph. In their eyes... sadness.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>It continues to breathe heavily.</context>
      <utterance>I don't think we really want to wait for him to catch his breath.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's through fighting. Look at him.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Keough raises his cannon.</context>
      <utterance>I don't care. Hank. End it.</utterance>
   <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No. Look. He's got nothing left.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Upon which, a twenty footer, another croc, thrusts up out of the water, seizing Hector. Screams. It death rolls Hector, flings him out of his mouth and in seconds, he's coming up for more. Keough blasts his Avenger. A direct hit. It takes the smaller croc's head right off sending it sailing into the air. It splashes down, the first head not to hit Kelly. They all then go for Hector, pulling him to shore. He's bleeding.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--</utterance>
   <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm okay.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Get him onto shore.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Keough quickly peels off his shirt. Gives it to Kelly, who goes to work.</context>
      <utterance>He heeds a tourniquet.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're gonna be okay.</utterance>
   <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Guess I finally got bit.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A sudden ROAR. Kelly screams as Jack and Keough wheel to see... the big croc. Maybe his final roar, he looks weak. GASPING in the crashed chopper. Jack and Keough approach.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah, you got bit. I'm gonna fix it.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEOUGH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's done. He's dying.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But something about this crocodile... his eyes looking back at them... nobody wants wants to take him out.</context>
      <utterance>Don't count on it.  We better take him out.</utterance>

      <utterance>That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And they kiss again, this one escalates a little. They break. And then he holds her. Tightly as the CAMERA PULLS UP to an AERIAL VIEW of them, embracing at the water's edge.</context>
      <utterance>Good thinking.</utterance>
