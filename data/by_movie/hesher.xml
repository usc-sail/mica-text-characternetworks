      <utterance>I was told to bring it here. That's what it says on my work order. Talk to that guy if you've got a problem.</utterance>

      <context>Tony looks through his papers for the work order. TJ doesn't like being ignored. He moves around to the driver's side of the wrecked car and wrenches open the bashed-in door. He climbs behind the wheel, slams the door shut and locks the door.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hesher is suddenly startled. His ears prick up like a rabbit. He hits the deck dragging TJ down with him. Their faces are close together. Hesher makes a very serious finger-to-mouth gesture to 'shhhh'. The SOUND of a car idling outside. Hesher listens. TJ is on his stomach, freaked. TJ looks around the room - a duffel bag, some beer cans, a few porn magazines, a weathered bass guitar and a sleeping bag. A car door closes loudly. Hesher peers through the window and sees a SECURITY GUARD inspecting TJ's bike in the front yard and then making his way toward the house. Hesher looks at TJ with serious and considered venom.</context>

      <mode>O.S. - CONT'D</mode>
      <context>TJ jumps to his feet and looks out the window. A dirty black van screams out onto the road and tears away, spraying dirt and rocks in its wake. The security guard stumbles around, covered in dirt and disoriented. He rushes back to his car and gives chase. TJ lets them get away up the street, then bolts to the front door.</context>

He takes the cap off of a large BLACK MAGIC MARKER. He holds it up to his nose and takes a long slow inhale. He exhales slow and long, staring hard at TJ. TJ looks around confused. Hesher recaps the marker, throws it hard at TJ and wanders off. The marker hits TJ, then falls to floor near his feet. He reaches for it. Mrs. Elsberry sees this.</context>

      <utterance>I don't know. We're talking at least eighteen hundred dollars, not including taxes, registration, ADM, or dealer's fees. On top of that, you'd need a driver's license. I'm guessing you don't have one of those. You'd need valid car insurance. I'm guessing you don't have that either. But even if you did have these things, I still couldn't sell it to you because the car's not street legal. There's a million reasons why I can't sell it to you.</utterance>

      <utterance>You hearing me here? These are very serious crimes we've been presented with. Let's just say someone had been in that car, and they'd burned - to death. We'd be talking about manslaughter, possibly murder. Have you thought about that? You'd be sitting here with detectives from Homicide right now. These are felony offences we're talking about, son. Serious jail-time offences.</utterance>

      <utterance>With his little mouse hand. So instead of eating the mouse the snake just curled up crying in the corner and the mouse ruled that fuckin' cage. And this went on for weeks, the snake wouldn't go near him. That tiny mouse used to sit in a little miniature lawn chair scratching his balls and shelling peanuts and this snake was just too scared to go near it. And cuz the snake was scared of that mouse I had to feed him other mice, but every time I dropped another mouse in the tank, it'd hide behind the brave mouse.

      <utterance>I'm here cause she's been trying to tell you guys something, but you don't want to listen... so I'm gonna fuckin' break it down.</utterance>
   <speaker>HESHER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Hesher makes a magic disappearing arm gesture, spilling a bit of beer on the floor.</context>
      <utterance>I pulled the gas tank from an old Chevy and I wanted to fuckin' blow it up, so I did. I didn't think about the millions of bits of metal that were gonna fly in every direction. I almost killed myself. I woke up in a hospital. I couldn't remember what happened and then this doctor at the end of my bed said 'son', and I said, 'don't call me son you fuckin' cunt', then he said, 'you blew off your nut'. Some shrapnel had penetrated my left scrotal sack and ripped the furry sucker right off. My left fucking nut was gone, just like that.</utterance>
   <speaker>HESHER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>The tiny crowd listens, half offended, half intrigued.</context>
      <utterance>I went crazy. I assaulted a nurse, a doctor or two, I can't remember. I got arrested. I got sent to juvie. But all I could think about day and night was my missing fuckin' nut. I couldn't eat or sleep, I just wanted my fucking nut back. I had to get out of there and find it, so I busted out of juvie and went lookin' for it. I looked for days, but didn't find shit.</utterance>
   <speaker>HESHER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And then one night I was taking a shit and I was just staring down at my balls, looking at my flabby piece of sack where my left nut used to be and then I noticed my right nut, for like the first time. My right nut was just sitting there, totally happy, just hanging out.</utterance>

      <context>Hesher looks up at TJ and Dad, sad and imploring, he's made his point. They look back at him stunned.</context>
      <utterance>All this time I'd been driving myself crazy thinking about my missing nut and not thinking about the nut I still had all along. And I realized, I've still got a nut. I've still got one good nut. God or the Devil or whoever left me with one good nut. At least I didn't lose both my nuts. I've still got one good nut and it works, and my dick works too.</utterance>

      <context>Hesher takes the last swig of his Budweiser. He sways, drunk. This soaks in with the crowd.</context>

      <context>Hesher throws the can down. He goes to stomp on it. He misses and stumbles, crashing into the microphone podium, knocking it over and falling in a heap with it. He starts puking on the stage. A couple of old ladies are horrified. The funeral director motions to his assistants that now is the time to move the coffin out. Hesitantly, they obey. Hesher looks over from the floor.</context>
