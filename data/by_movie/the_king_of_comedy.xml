   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>

      <utterance>Thanks, Jerry. I'm grateful for this chance to talk to you ... I hope I'm not boring you.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll let you know.</utterance>
   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Really? Fine. I'm Rupert Pupkin, Jerry. I know that the name itself doesn't mean very much to you but it means an awful lot to me, believe me. Maybe you've seen me</utterance>
   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Well, right now, I'm in communications but, by nature, I'm a stand-up comedian. I know what you're thinking -- 'oh no. Not another one.' And I wouldn't take up even one minute of your time if I wasn't absolutely convinced of my talent. I'm really good, Jerry, believe me, I'm dynamite. Now you're probably wondering if I'm so good why haven't you caught my act somewhere, right?</context>
      <utterance>outside your show and wondered who I am.</utterance>
   <speaker>LANGFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well ...</utterance>
   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>PUPKIN fishes a cigarette case out of his jacket pocket, flips it open and offers one to LANGFORD.</context>
      <utterance>Well, up to now, I've been biding my time, developing my act slowly and carefully so that when my big break finally comes, I'm ready -- like you were that night Paar got sick and you sat in for him. I was there that night, in the theater. That was the most important night of my life, until tonight, of course.</utterance>
   <speaker>LANGFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>PUPKIN returns the pack to his pocket.</context>
      <utterance>No thanks. I don't smoke.</utterance>
   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Me neither. I just carry them as a courtesy. How about a cough drop?</utterance>
   <speaker>LANGFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No thanks. I don't cough.</utterance>
   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I try not to but sometimes, you know ... Am I making any sense?</utterance>
   <speaker>LANGFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Go on.</utterance>
   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, that night you did Paar, I walked out of the theater like I was in a dream. All of a sudden, I knew what I wanted. I started catching your guest appearances on Sullivan and taping them and, when you got your own show, it got to be a kind of regular thing. I studied how you built to your one-liners, nice and relaxed like you were chatting, and how you delivered</utterance>
   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There is a long pause.</context>
      <utterance>the jokes without leaning too much on them, without saying "here's the punchline, folks." And I watched the way you played off dead audiences, how you let those long silences build until people couldn't stand it and then the way you got them off the hook with that slow smile. You were my college of comedy, Jerry, like a kind of teacher, a friend. I know it sounds crazy, but when you watch someone every night ... But that's all in the past. What I'm trying to say is this. I'm ready now. I've finished the course. And I'm thinking as we sit here talking "Is this it? Is this that one big break?" Is it, Jerry?</utterance>
   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Jerry?</utterance>
   <speaker>LANGFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look ... er ... what was the name?</utterance>
   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm Rupert, Jerry.</utterance>
   <speaker>LANGFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look, Rupert. I know what you're saying. But things don't work that way. You can't just walk onto a network show without any experience. You've got to start at the bottom ...</utterance>
   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But that's where I am!</utterance>
   <speaker>LANGFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You've got to work your way up, learn your trade in front of live audiences, start playing the little clubs.</utterance>
   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Is that asking too much?</context>
      <utterance>But that can take years, Jerry! Look at me. I'm already 31 years old! People my age are way ahead of me. I've got some catching up to do and I need your help. What do you say, Jerry? All I'm asking you to do is listen to my act. That's all.</utterance>
   <speaker>LANGFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>All they want ...</context>
      <utterance>I get calls from agents every day.</utterance>

      <utterance>Could I?!? Oh, I knew you'd say that, Jerry. You don't know how many times I've had this conversation in my head. And this is the way it always turns out. That's why I had to sort of invite myself into the car tonight. I know it's kind of presumptuous and I really appreciate the time you've given me. But breaks like this don't just happen. You have to make your own breaks.</utterance>

      <utterance>Why not me, Rita? A guy can always get what he wants if he's willing to pay the price. All it takes is a little talent and sacrifice and the right break. If you've got a friend in the right place, that's all it takes. And that's exactly what I have going for me right now. After all, crazier things have happened.</utterance>

A shot like that means a free ticket on the comedy circuit -- Flip Wilson one week, Cosby the next, then Sonny and Cher or Carol Burnett. And you've always got those other talk shows to fall back on -- Carson, Griffin. And all that leads straight in one direction, Rita -- Hollywood! That's when we really start</utterance>

We set up the bungalows, dig some lakes, lay out a golf course, you know, fix the whole place up so it's usable. Then young, personable guys like me show the people around. It the guy seems tight, we point out the investment factor. If he's a swinger, well, the bungalows are very private. If he's a sports nut, we talk up skiing and fishing and tennis.</utterance>

      <utterance>First, Miss Long. Thanks very much for your help at the office and for passing this along to Jerry. I appreciate it more than you know.</utterance>
   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now, Jerry. Before I begin, I just want to thank you for listening to this material and for the opportunity that you've given me. You know, lots of people think that guys like you, you know, people who have made it, lose their feeling for struggling</utterance>
   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>PUPKIN pushes a button on the cassette and we hear the theme song of the Jerry Langford Show, followed by the voice of BERT CANTER, the announcer.</context>
      <utterance>young talent such as myself. But now I know from experience that those people are just cynics, embittered by their own failure. I know, Jerry, that you're as human as the rest of us, if not more so.  Oh well, I guess there's no point going on about it. You know how I feel. So let's get on with the show. The best of Rupert Pupkin! I've sketched out this little introduction in order to save you a little time. So close your eyes and imagine it's exactly six o'clock. You're standing in the wings and we hear Rick Ross and the Orchestra strike up your theme song.</utterance>
   <speaker>BERT CANTER'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>PUPKIN deftly shuts off the cassette and substitutes his own voice for that of CANTER's. The large tape recorder keeps rolling.</context>

   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>

      <utterance>... the comedy find of the year making his television debut, Rupert Pupkin, the King of Comedy!</utterance>
   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now you come on, Jerry, and do your monologue. Then, when the time comes, this is how I see you introducing me. You'll say something like this. "Ladies and Gentlemen we're going to do something a little bit different tonight. It isn't often that you can call someone a sure thing in the entertainment business. After all, the verdict is always in your hands. But I think after you've met my next guest, that you'll agree with me that he's destined for greatness. So, now, will you please give your warmest welcome to the newest King of Comedy, Rupert Pupkin!!!"</utterance>

   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Good evening, ladies and gentleman. Let me introduce myself. My name is Rupert Pupkin. I was born in Clifton, New Jersey, which was not, at that time, a federal offense.  Is there anyone here from Clifton?  Good. We can all relax. Now, I'd like to begin by saying that my parents were too poor to afford me a childhood but the fact is nobody is allowed to be really poor in Clifton. Once you fall below eleven thousand you're exiled to Passaic. My parents did, in fact, put down the first two payments on my childhood. Then they tried to return me to the hospital as defective. But, like everyone else I grew up in large part thanks to my mother. If she was only here today I'd say, "Hey, mom. What are you doing here? You've been dead for nine years?"  You should have seen my mother. She was wonderful -- blonde, beautiful, intelligent, alcoholic.  We used to drink milk together after school. Mine was homogenized. Hers was loaded.  Once she was picked up for speeding. They clocked her doing fifty -- in our garage.  When they tested her they found that her alcohol was two per cent blood. They took away her license and she died shortly afterwards. We used to joke together Mom and me, until the tears would stream down her face and she'd</utterance>
   <speaker>PUPKIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>throw up.  And who would clean it up? Not Dad. He was too busy down at O'Grady's throwing up on his own. In fact, until I was sixteen, I thought throwing up was a sign of maturity. While the other kids were off in the woods sneaking cigarettes, I was hiding behind the house with my fingers down my throat.  I never got anywhere until one day, my father caught me. Just as he was giving me a final kick in the stomach, for luck, I managed to heave all over his new shoes. "That's it," I thought. "I've made it. I'm finally a man!"  As it turned out, that was the only time my father ever paid any real attention to me. He was usually too busy out in the park playing ball with my sister, Rose. And, today thanks to those many hours of practice, my sister Rose has grown into a fine man.  Me, I wasn't especially interested in athletics. The only exercise I ever got was when the other kids picked on me. They used to beat me up once a week, usually Tuesday. After a while, the school worked it into the curriculum. And, if you knocked me out, you got extra credit.  Except there was this one kid who was afraid of me. I kept telling him, "Hit me! Hit me! What's the matter with you? Don't you want graduate?" As for me, I was the only kid in the history of the school to graduate in traction. The school nurse tucked my diploma into my sling. But my only real interest, right from the beginning, was show business. Even as a young man, I began at the very top, collecting autographs.</utterance>
