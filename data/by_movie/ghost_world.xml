      <utterance>High school is like the training wheels for the bicycle of real life. It is a time for young people to explore different fields of interest and to hopefully grow from their experiences. After all, that which we learn from our mistakes can be as valuable as what we learn from our textbooks, and often we can turn the negative experiences that are common to all high-schoolers into positive steps toward personal growth and achievement. In coming to terms with my own personal setback, which I'm sure you've all heard about, I've been able to learn a lot about myself. I've learned for one thing that I don't need to rely on drugs and alcohol</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>and that I'm very lucky-that more people besides Carrie and myself weren't hurt in the accident; I've learned that I'm blessed with wonderful parents, teachers and above all the best classmates in the world -- I love each and every one of you guys!!</utterance>
   <speaker>SPEAKER</speaker>
      <mode>APPLAUSE</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>and I've learned that to get through life's obstacles you need faith, hope and, most of all, a sense of humor.</utterance>

WE MOVE OVER the faces of all the guys and stop on a skinny, introverted-looking guy with a pool-cue. He makes a shot and instantly goes into an ostentatious cue twirling routine. Her gaze drifts on. She sees herself in a mirror behind the bar and takes off her hat reconfiguring her hair. She reaches into her purse and puts on a bulkier pair of glasses. This is interrupted by BLUESHAMMER taking the stage. Young, white, cocky, pretty boys.</context>

      <utterance>Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.</utterance>

      <context>Rebecca goes over and gets Enid's sketchbook out of the box and flips through it. When she gets to the right page she hands it to Seymour.</context>

   <speaker>REBECCA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We see a pasted-up PERSONAL AD beside a DRAWING OF SEYMOUR in Wowsville. On the facing page we see a drawing of JOSH with his name surrounded by RED HEARTS.</context>
      <utterance>Here. Read it and weep.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.</utterance>
