      <context>Under water a long boat passes overhead, its oars breaking the surface. Sc 9 EXT BEACH DAY Sc 9 Amidst a riotous sea a woman, ADA, is carried to shore on the shoulders of five seamen. Her large Victorian skirt spreads across the men's arms and backs, on her head a black bonnet, around her neck her pad and pen. We should be forgiven if this woman seems a sacrificial offering as the bay they carry her to is completely uninhabited. A black sand backs on to an endless rise of dense native bush. The breakers are chaotic, the men strain to keep their footing, calling to each other.</context>

   <speaker>SEAMEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Two of the men are black, all are battered, tattooed and tough, some are drunk. Behind the woman is her daughter, a girl of ten in Scottish dress. She too is carried on the shoulders of seamen. ADA is placed on the sand. She looks down at her feet sinking into the wet sand, then up at the huge confusion of fern and bush in front of her. The sound of sea behind is thunderous. Several of the seamen have formed a group and are pissing on the sand. Her daughter is on all fours evidently being sick. But ADA's attention is diverted to the seamen who are staggering through the waves with a huge piano shaped box. They put it down as soon as they get to 5hore but ADA makes gestures that they must immediately bring it to higher safer ground. The piano placed to her satisfaction she hovers near it, one hand in constant touch of it while her daughter grips her free hand. Sc 10 EXT BEACH DAY Sc 10 TWO SEAMEN finish carrying the last crate to shore. Trunks and boxes including an open crate with hens are scattered carelessly along the shore. The SEAMEN gather together. After a discussion in which they look between ADA and her child and their Coaster out on the sea, one of the men approaches. Behind him the other men keep their eyes out to sea or down on the sand. They don't want to be involved. The sight of the women alone on this beach is too hopeless.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>ADA is sheltering behind the crated piano, anxiety etched on her face. FLORA is asleep at her feet a half eaten biscuit in her hand ADA has found a gap through the crate so that she might lift the lid and play a few notes. The sweetness and comfort of the piano seem only to exaggerate their isolation and hopelessness. 2- See notes Suddenly a rush of sea water shoots straight under the raised crate of the piano wetting her shoes. ADA stands, pushing FLORA onto her feet. She is aghast to see the tide has crept in completely unnoticed. They watch three of their boxes float out to sea. One of the hens has escaped the crate and is bobbing up and down in the waves.</context>

   <speaker>SCENE 13 DELETED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There is just a pink streak left in the sky. ADA and FLORA shelter inside their make-shift tent, a hooped petticoat secured at the edges with stones. Inside the tent a candle lights up their conversation. ADA is hand signaling a story to FLORA who lies back watching, nervous and afraid. ADA's whole self is involved in the "telling", her face is alight with expression, now tender, now sad, now humorous, now soft, while her hands and fingers are deft and precise. From outside it is an odd shadow play.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Through a dense bush walk a party of fourteen MAORI people and two EUROPEAN MEN. The wetness, closeness and darkness of the bush is such that the air seems green, like at the bottom of a deep sea. Two of the MAORIS share one pair of shoes and all of them are clothed in a mixture of native and European costume. Of the Europeans one is small and has a shy manner. He has a half completed Maori tattoo across his cheeks. The other is a similar age about 45 and wears a suit, muddy and out of place here in the bush. He staggers, spurts forward then slows to a stop. His hair and face are wet and his skin reflects the green foliage. BAINES the younger man turns and slows.</context>
      <utterance>Mother... I'm thinking ADA pauses.  I'm not going to call him Papa. I'm not going to call HIM anything. I'm not even going to look at HIM. Sc 15 EXT BUSH ON WAY TO BEACH DAY Sc 15</utterance>

      <context>It is early morning. The sea is calmer and the tide is again low. The party or two EUROPEANS and fourteen MAORI MEN and WOMEN come out on to the beach. About half the MAORI party head straight for the shoreline where an older woman loudly organises a pipi collection. All sorts of containers are used from flax baskets to shirts with knots in their arms. The rest follow STEWART and BAINES over to the boxes. STEWART automatically re-combs his hair, patting it against his forehead, where it sticks in a raked pattern. On his head he carefully places a formal top hat, oddly dean compared to his mud splattered suit. The party stops short of the petticoats where a tell-tale foot reveals its occupants.</context>

      <context>STEWART smiling searches ADA's face for some sign of comprehension but is unnerved by her lack of response. He stops smiling, and, patting his hair walks to the closest box. Several of the MAORI party follow behind STEWART while one of them closely and particularly mimics him.</context>

With great dignity HONE retreats, too injured to help. Other MAORIS come up and BAINES assigns them boxes. ADA gets worried, the piano is being left alone. She writes on her pad, "THE PIANO?"

Its distance and her love of it suddenly strike her. Its music is faint and becomes loud over the next scene.

The party of three break onto the long expanse of beach where the piano still stands. It has not been without visitors. There are footprints on the sand and some of the boards have been pulled back. ADA passes BAINES, walking urgently towards it. Soon, ADA has removed enough boards that she may lift the lid and play the keys. EMNES stays back. ADA takes great delight in feeling her fingers on the keys again. Her whole composition is altered. She is animated, joyful, excited. Down on the wet sand FLORA does a wild dance of her own invention using a seaweed wig. She finishes by rolling down the beach in the sand. BAINES views them with suspicion, yet he is magnetically drawn to the spectacle He has never seen women behave with so much abandon. His attention fixes on ADA's uninhibited emotional playing, and as he watches, he finds himself edging irresistibly closer. Sc 30 EXT BEACH LATE AFTER NOONSc 30 The shadows are long on the sand when BAIN'ES collects the boards. ADA and FLORA are attempting a duet. ADA notices him come towards them with the boards, obviously intending that they should leave. Her mood darkens, she continues playing stubbornly even though FLORA has stopped. Abruptly she finishes. In black spirits she replaces her cape and bonnet. BAINES is struck by this sudden change, he watches her mesmerised as he replaces the boards.

While ADA "plays" the notes FLORA sings them. STEWART puts his pack down. ADA stands to attention, folding the tablecloth back over the table. 5, 6 + 7 See notes</context>

The MAORI girls are part of the mission's good works. They are dressed in European style and while their training is in polite proper domestic behaviour they constantly corrupt it with their demonstrative displays of affection, and their clay tobacco pipes to which they are addicted.

Sc 50 EXT BAINES' VERANDAH DAY Sc 50 It's raining heavily, FLORA sits on the small verandah outside BAINES' hut, her legs stuck straight out into the wet. She is overseeing a merciless power game with the dog, forcing it out of the verandah with a stick. Sc 51 INT BAINE'S HUT DAY Sc 51 ADA's playing can be heard inside. BAINES sits back watching ADA. Her cape on the hook is dripping a puddle on to the floor and there is a circle of drips around her skirt hem. She is totally absorbed in her piano music as she was on the beach. BAINES watches. Her long white neck, now wet from rain, proves irresistible. He comes across the room and kisses her. ADA jumps up and prepares to leave. BAINES stands in front of the door.</context>

BAINES is counting the keys. ADA starts for the front door. All right, all right then, the black keys. She sits back at the piano. She plays the lowest black key as in number one She takes her hands off the piano waiting. It's better that you play.

      <mode></mode>
      <context>ADA is taken unawares. She sits a moment unsure if she wants to cooperate, then slowly she staffs to undo her buttons. ADA pulls her arms out of the tight sleeves. Underneath she wears a worn-in bodice. Her arms are so white they seem transparent. A delicate network of blue-green veins crisscross up the soft underpart of her arms. A dark growth of hair in her armpit suggests a shadowy depth. The back of her hands, normally white, are quite tanned in comparison.</context>

   <speaker>BAINES</speaker>

      <context>BAINES draws his chair close. Gently he places his hand on the soft underpart of her forearm. ADA stiffens and pulls away. He grips the arm. Two keys. ADA continues to play. Slowly he moves his hand higher towards her shoulder. Clearly unnerved she changes the music to something brisk, almost comical. BAINES feels suddenly ridiculous, his mood broken. He takes his hand away and moves back to the window injured. ADA is victorious, she is pleased to have won herself a respite.

As BAINES passes be knocks the jacket off the chair back. He picks it up and takes it across to her seat by the window. BAINES nods and ADA begins to play. BAINES fingers the still warm jacket1 he lifts it up and smells it. ADA turns around and stops playing suddenly appalled by his odd sensual pleasure taking. She holds out her hand for the jacket, her expression stern and censorious. She indicates he should return it to the chair back. BAINES ignores her. ADA stands and comes over to BAINES. She pulls the jacket from his hands and replaces it across the chair back, but as she turns to sit, BAINES is beside her. He pulls the shoulders of her bodice down, exposing her shoulders and some of her breast. ADA immediately stands, but BMNES is much stronger and man-handles her across to the bed. ADA struggles seriously, this is much, much more than she was expecting.</context>
      <utterance>Ah well, slowly, slowly</utterance>
   <speaker>BAINES</speaker>

      <context>ADA holds up five fingers and mouths 'five'. I just want to lie. ADA shakes her head vigorously and again mouths five'. All right, all right five. ADA no longer struggles. She is stiff and still. BAINES intoxicated by the smell and presence of her skin becomes soft and gentle. He kisses and touches her with feeling and affection. Then suddenly aware of her stillness he too becomes still. He pulls himself up to see whether her face betrays her feelings. ADA seizes this opportunity to return to the uncertain sanctuary of her piano. From the bed, BAINES watches her run a hand noiselessly over the polished ivory keys, a gesture betraying affection never afforded to him. BAINES gets up. He shuts the piano lid forcing ADA to remove her hand. ADA immediately stands and dresses, marking hurtfully BAINES' ownership of her piano. Sc 63 EXT STEWART'S HUT SUNSETSc 63 A golden evening. STEWART in his best shirt and trousers prepares the horse and cart.

Her touch, meant practically, strangely affects him. In an impassioned impasse, meant gallantly, he tries to kiss ADA's finger tips. The gesture falters as ADA, surprised, jumps back.

BAINES watches STEWART squeezing her hand and quite out of control stands and leaves accompanied by a chorus of eshhhhhhhhhhhhhn. Satisfied, ADA watches him go. The children file on with their candles, They stand in a group singing with great seriousness, but struck with shyness their voices are so small as barely to be heard. -sing up Billy! -Come on sing out!

      <context>Sc 74EXT STEWARTS VEGETABLE PATCHDAYSc 74 ADA has cut a good sized cabbage in the vegetable patch. She throws it to FLORA who misses, dropping it in a pool of mud, spattering her face and dress. ADA smiles and FLORA who was about to cry gives the cabbage a big football beet towards her mother. ADA's mouth falls open, but then she too kicks it and they begin to dribble the mud caked cabbage towards the hut, all the time signing playful insults. Into this arrives STEWART.</context>

      <context>ADA is perplexed by this turn about of behaviour. A little uncertainly, she sets about her playing. After a little she too turns to see what BAINES is doing. He's not there. She is surprised then anxious as she fears the deal may be off when there are flaw so few keys to go. She starts to play again, but her anxieties prove too great. She stops and listens. She looks out the window, where FLORA is mucking about in the yard. She walks to his bedroom, listens, then opens the door. BAINES stands naked looking at her. ADA is taken aback</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hesitantly, she starts to undress. She lies on her petticoat, having deemed the bed too dirty. BAINES lies, very still on top of her. A scraping sound is heard. Sc 76 EXT/INT BAINES' HUT DAY Sc 76 FLORA is outside walking on sticks and logs trying to make sure she never puts her foot on the ground. She looks over at the house suddenly aware that the piano playing has stopped again. She investigates the mystery peeping through the various cracks and holes in the loosely built hut. Her vision is always only parts of bodies, the venture is one of challenge and curiosity. Sc 77 EXT NATIVE PINE FOREST DAY Sc 77 FLORA and three small Maori children play amongst some native pines. Two MAORI WOMEN smoke and chat nearby. The children rub up and down against the tree trunks kissing and hugging them. The game has an edge of promiscuity to it as they exchange trunks and hug one tree as a group. Unseen by the children STEWART marches towards FLORA. He pulls her off the tree.</context>

Sc 80 EXT PATH TO BAINES' DAY Sc 8O The next day is very windy, the tops of trees are thrashed by fierce gusts of wind and some smaller branches crash to the ground. ADA's long dress and cape flap uncontrollably. FLORA's smaller cape stands out on end. Birds fly in mad wind-battered courses, swooped up then strangely drawn down. Sc 81 EXT BAINES' DAY Sc 81 ADA and FLORA arrive at BAINES' place to see the piano emerge from the hut carried by six MAORI MEN, one of whom does nothing but walk beside it "plonking" the keys. Another group of MAORIS sit cross-legged on the verandah playing draughts. Panicked ADA hurries down the hill to the hut. FLORA follows behind. Sc 82 INT BAINES' HUT DAY Sc 82 Inside the hut, HIRA, the old woman from the bathing spot, is smoking her pipe. ADA enters distraught and indicates what she has seen.

Sc 83 EXT BAINES' HUT &amp; BUSH DAY Sc 83 As she climbs out of the small valley surrounding BAINES' hut, she stops and walks back to look down at BAINES and his hut, in the EXACT same manner that she once looked at her piano from the cliff-top above the beach. BAINES is throwing the scraps of his meal to his dog, he does not look up.

      <context>Grimly STEWART slaps the top of the piano to FLORA's playing. ADA continues to walk, her face dark and puzzled. She stops. Her head stiffly, irresistibly, lifts and turns in the direction BAINES' hut. She peers deep into the bush as if attempting to penetrate a puzzle. She thinks and walks on. Sc 88 INT STEWART'S KITCHEN DAY Sc 88 The next day ADA and her piano face each other across the kitchen. A slit of light falls across the piano highlighting it's rosey walnut wood. ADA's expression is critical and distant. Taking a cloth she begins to clean and polish the piano. Her finger holds down one of the keys and we glimpse an old inscription on its side, a small heart, and an arrow. Putting the cloth aside she sits at the piano to begin playing. She starts with wholehearted feeling, her eyes closed, but before long she is surprised by a moving reflection across the piano and she 'starts', glancing over her shoulder. She stops and begins again. But once more a reflex has her glance across her left shoulder and she pauses in her playing. Disquieted she starts again and again she looks away. She stops, confused, unable to go on, unable to getup, one hand on the lid and one on the piano keys. Sc 89 EXT PATH TO BAINES' DAY Sc 89 ADA carrying her cape and bonnet hurries through the narrow bush path to BAINES' hut, FLORA has a fist of her skirt and is pulling back.

      <context>FLORA races off as fast as she can, enlivened by her wickedness. STEWART clambers back up the path. He just glimpses the distant figure of ADA nervously turning, her skirts flying as she hurries up the bush path The wind bothers the tops of the trees, setting them groaning, rubbing their branches against each other. Sc 90 INT BAINES' HUT DAY Sc 90 ADA enters BAINES' hut, she is breathless1 announcing her presence by simply being there, standing there. BAINES comes through from the bedroom.

   <speaker>BAINES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ADA does not respond, finally she looks at BAINES and her look has a vulnerability and frankness that takes him off guard. Does he know something? ADA shakes her head. The piano is not harmed? It arrived safely? Would you like to sit? I am going to sit. ADA does not sit. She stands immobilised. BAINES attempts to maintain his casual charade) he pours a tea. He turns to her about to speak, but stops unmanned by a new fragility to her strength. He blinks rapidly</context>
      <utterance>So what brings you here? Did you leave something? I have not found anything.</utterance>
   <speaker>BAINES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>BAINES walks roughly towards the door and opens it, his softness turned suddenly cruel. Go! Go NOW! Leave! ADA is stung by his change of tune, she takes a step towards him and eyes filling with tears of anger hits him hard across the face. BAINES' nose begins to bleed yet his face slowly lights up as if she has spoken words of love. ADA is flushed, shocked, the two face each other at this very moment of profound awareness of each other, profoundly equal. With each new breath, with every moment that their eyes remained locked together the promise of intimacy is confirmed and reconfirmed and detailed until like sleepwalkers who do not know how they came to wake where they did, they are standing next to each other and beginning to kiss each other, the lips, the cheeks, the nose. There is nothing practised about their tenderness, only their feelings and emotions guide their instincts. BAINES' face crumples with the exquisite pain of his pleasure, ADA cradles his head to her chest. BAINES struggles through her dress anxious to touch her skin. Sc 91 EXT/INT BAINES' HUT DAY Sc 91 Outside STEWART surveys the hut suspiciously. BAINES' dog growls as he climbs on to the small verandah. Carefully STEWART peers through some loosely slatted boards. There are sounds inside which are worrying him. By standing on the seat he has found a spyhole where he can see ADA and BAINES kissing, undressing He reels back angry, but just as we might expect him to burst through, he steps up to look again; the fatal second look, the look for curiosity. He watches BAINES bare-chested undressing ADA, her buttons burst, ADA laughs, BAINES touches her under her skirts - anywhere, he takes himself under her dress pulling down her stockings. STEWART watches, stepping down to peer lower as BAINES buries into ADA's skirt. He does not seem to notice the dog licking his hand. Suddenly he pulls his hand away and looks at it, wet with dog saliva, he wipes it on the boards and continues watching as if mesmerised. Sc 92 INT BAINES' BEDROOM DAY Sc 92 Inside BAINES' small bedroom the raw dark boards contrast with the softness, whiteness of BAINES' and ADA's bodies, The long black strands of ADA's hair stick to her cheek and wrap around her neck. Her face is flushed and her eyes are bright. BAINES rolls his face across her chest, gently, slowly savouring the flavour of her body. Drunkenly they continue their sex slowly, slowly. ADA's breaths turn to low murmurs; these small sounds are extraordinarily moving to BAINES whose face swoons with joy.</context>
      <utterance>Ada, I am unhappy because I want you, because my mind has seized on you and thinks of nothing else. This is how I suffer, I am sick with longing. I don't eat, I don't sleep. If you do not want me, if you have come with no feeling for me, then go!</utterance>

      <context>ADA is distracted, collecting her buttons from the floor, concerned at the time past, worried to dress and return. The camera cranes down and down to find STEWART wedged under the loose wooden floor slats. He cannot hear clearly, but ADA's hand reaching for each button is only inches away. One falls through a slat on to STEWART'S neck and on down his shirt collar. As she stands he rolls out.</context>

   <speaker>BAINES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ADA considers this question. Clearly she doesn't know, the question is more complex to her than to him, then as if by way of answer she kisses him strongly and sexually. BAINES pulls away confused. ADA finishes dressing. BAINES comes up behind her to help with the buttons.</context>
      <utterance>Wait! I don't know what you're thinking.  Does this mean something to you? Hey?  I already miss you. Ada, do you love me?</utterance>

The sky is dark and the wind is ballooning ADA's cape, wrapping it up high around her. The tree tops are swaying furiously. Inside the bush it is dark and ADA hurries up through the path. She is out or breath and glancing behind her as if to guard against followers, when directly in front of her STEWART steps out onto her path. ADA stops short. The look on his face is unlike any expression she has yet seen. His eyes do not look at her, but all about her in a way more animal than human. She lowers her eyes and calling his bluff walks steadily past him. But STEWART takes her arm and spinning her back, pulls her close and blind to all protest kisses her. ADA struggles furiously. His grip falters and she steps back staring at him, then runs off down the hill, but STEWART is on top of her clasping her skirts, pulling her towards him hand over hand, she slips and falls to the ground. STEWART is upon her, lifting her dress, touching her legs, ADA goes quite still, which throws STEWART long enough for her to scramble away, yet again STEWART catches her and again they roll on the ground, STEWART touching and kissing her, ADA turning herself this way and that to avoid it. There is a cat and mouse quality to their mute struggle finally broken by FLORA calling up the path, distraught and in tears, her angel wings have twisted about her waist.</context>

She sits at her piano and begins to play loudly and strongly. Her hair is loose and she seems half-asleep. FLORA and STEWART wake to the loud playing and fumble their way to the kitchen. STEWART carries a lit candle. ADA continues her playing FLORA passes a hand in front of ADA's face.</context>

ADA is tossing in the small bed beside FLORA, her hair wound across her face, she makes low moaning sounds as she pushes her face and body up against the sleeping FLORA. Her movement and moans increase until she wakes suddenly sitting bolt upright. Sc 104INT STEWART'S KITCHEN &amp; BEDROOMNIGHT Sc 104 ADA walks through the kitchen, small slithers of moonlight lighting her path. She walks past the piano into STEWART'S room who has gone to sleep with his candle still alight. ADA looks, then slowly her hand hovers above him before lightly touching his face. His eyes open, he looks towards ADA anxious and surprised, but as ADA continues, his reserve breaks and he is captive to his own sensations.

His eyes well with tears and he looks up into her face like a child after a bad dream, fearful and trusting. ADA continues like a nurse spreading ointment on a wound, tenderly and attentively she strokes down towards his belly. STEWART'S skin goose bumps and be shudders. He puts his hand on hers to still it1 she slides hers out and continues stroking. He looks at her pleadingly and childlike, she stops and kisses the soft skin of his belly, STEWART groans clutching the mattress.

ADA unclenches his fist and once more, slowly pulls them down.

      <context>His hand begins to move further and further up her leg, nudging the nightgown higher and higher. He looks at her face. She is closed-eyed, unconscious. STEWART'S face crinkles into a pained expression and all his control melts into a drive to hold and extend this moment. He brings his mouth to her leg and begins to kiss her knee, her thigh. A new thought occurs to him, a terrible thought, but as he has phrased the thought to himself, he cannot resist it. He glances at her face still fevered and unconscious. Quietly, stealthily, he begins to undo his belt buckle. He bends across her to gently separate her legs. As he moves his body over her, he looks towards her and to his shame and horror she is looking directly back at him, her eyes perfectly on his, perfectly focused. Quietly STEWART moves back and pulls down her gown, all the time keeping his eyes on her.</context>

      <context>The sound of his own voice makes him blink. He watches her as if listening to her speak in a voice that is so faint, and distant, that only with great concentration and perseverance can he make it out. As he watches her his face transforms; his eyes fill, his lips soften and his eyebrows take on the exact expression of her own. The kerosene lamp burns fitfully, fluttering a light pulse across their faces. STEWART moves closer to ADA. Outside a wind bangs the iron roof and rubs branches against each other making a high-pitched see-saw sound. He leans closer still.

As they maneuver the piano to the edge ADA Jocks into the water. She puts her hand into the sea and moves it back and forth. The piano is carefully lowered and with a heave topples over. As the piano splashes into the sea, the loose ropes speed their way after it. ADA watches them snake past her feet and then out of a fatal curiosity, odd and undisciplined, she steps into a loop. The rope tightens and grips her foot so that she is snatched into the sea, and pulled by the piano down through the cold water. Sc 146INT SEA NEAR BEACH DAY Sc 146 Bubbles tumble from her mouth. Down she falls, on and on. her eyes are open, her clothes twisting about her. The MAORIS diving after her cannot reach her in these depths. ADA begins to struggle. She kicks at the rope, but it holds tight around her boot. She kicks hard again and then with her other foot, levers herself free from her shoe.
