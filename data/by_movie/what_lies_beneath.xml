   <speaker>CLAIRE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Let's go. Or we'll never leave on time. From out of the pillow comes Caitlin's voice.</utterance>

      <context>Claire glances around at the piles of unpacked clothes.</context>
      <utterance>I'm totally ready.</utterance>
   <speaker>CLAIRE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Claire gently swats at the tiny lump that is Caitlin's behind.</context>
      <utterance>Come on, I'll make you some waffles, maybe we'll squeeze in a trip to the mall.  Caitlin...</utterance>
   <speaker>CAITLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Claire stands and instinctively scoops up some clothes from the floor, then folds and neatly stacks them on a box. Caitlin turns her head sideways on the pillow.</context>
      <utterance>Mother...</utterance>
   <speaker>CAITLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Claire turns at the door.</context>
      <utterance>You're such a morning person.</utterance>
   <speaker>CLAIRE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It is unwise to heckle the keeper of the plastic. She starts to leave. Caitlin calls out.</utterance>

      <utterance>Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?</utterance>

      <utterance>I think three...</utterance>
   <speaker>NORMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She continues to gaze downward. The man leans over the hood, murmuring darkly at his wife, though for Claire and Norman the scene is entirely silent.</context>
      <utterance>Three weeks.</utterance>

      <utterance>What's their name?</utterance>
   <speaker>NORMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Outside, Mr. Feur turns and walks toward his house. Norman begins, once again, to nuzzle Claire. Her eyes close, but then she gently demurs.</context>
      <utterance>Feur, I think. Psych department. Figures. They're all psychotic.</utterance>

      <utterance>She's awake.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORMAN</speaker>

      <context>She turns to him.</context>
      <utterance>We'll be quiet. Quick and quiet.</utterance>
   <speaker>CLAIRE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He smiles. A really good smile. The lips and tongue on his faded T-shirt mark him as a 'Stones fan.</context>
      <utterance>I don't want to be either.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Alright. I can't take the rejection. I'm going to class.</utterance>

      <context>She smiles at him. After a beat:</context>

   <speaker>CLAIRE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Caitlin smiles back and nods, her face betraying some concern. Claire takes her hand.</context>
      <utterance>Sweetheart, I've known this day was coming for a long time. I've got your father and the garden and the new house. You really don't have to worry.</utterance>
   <speaker>CLAIRE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She nods reassuringly and pulls Caitlin into an embrace. Her eyes close.</context>

   <speaker>CAITLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Her eyes open. Widen to reveal Claire, holding Caitlin on the college campus. The URBAN SKYLINE looms in the background.</context>
      <utterance>Mom.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAITLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>After a moment's hesitation, she releases her grip. Caitlin glances over her shoulder to make sure no one's witnessed this overt display of maternal affection.</context>
      <utterance>I have'ta go.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAITLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Claire produces an ENVELOPE, which she presses into her daughter's hand. It's a book of TRAIN TICKETS.</context>

   <speaker>NORMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She throws her arm, briefly, tightly around his waist. A bit overwhelmed, he slowly brings his hand to the back of Caitlin's head. After a moment, she steps back...</context>
      <utterance>Be good.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAITLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>...then turns and makes her way toward the large, old Columbia dorm. A banner is draped across its portals which reads:</context>

   <speaker>CLAIRE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They start to kiss. It's slow and a bit methodical in the manner of long time lovers. Suddenly, the SOUND OF A WOMAN WAILING can be heard. They stop.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Did you...</utterance>
   <speaker>CLAIRE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They listen. The sounds start to become louder. It is clearly two people in the throes of some very vocal and savage love making.</context>
      <utterance>Shhh.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He walks over and closes the window. It doesn't help.</context>
      <utterance>Jesus.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The woman's moaning becomes embarrassingly loud.</context>

   <speaker>CLAIRE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They lie together in silence as the cacophony drones on.</context>

   <speaker>NORMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And we moved out here for the quiet.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Beat. The mood has passed.</context>

I did...I put her in the lake. I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away. Don't you see, Claire? She's doing this! This is exactly what she wants you to think!</utterance>

      <context>She looks up again into the mirror. Her face goes strangely blank and, almost mechanically, she clasps the necklace onto her neck. Suddenly, she stares over at the CORDLESS PHONE lying on the bed for a long moment. She walks over, picks up the phone and looks at it.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>...then she's lowered into the tub.</context>
      <utterance>Wasn't until the shower that I realized you actually believed it. Nearly froze to death waiting for you. Thought the circuit breaker would kick back over and I'd be toast.</utterance>

   <speaker>NORMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He turns on the faucets, then moves out of her line of vision. Sound of a number being dialed.</context>
      <utterance>Don't worry about Caitlin. I'm sure in some tragic way this'll bring us closer together.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORMAN</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>She glances down and sees on the edge of the tub...a prescription bottle of VALIUM with her name on the label. Her eyes go wide.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, it's Norman. Listen, we had a huge blowout, so I'm going down to sleep at the lab. I guess you're out, but... maybe...if you wouldn't mind stopping by to check on her in the morning?</utterance>

      <context>Norman, lit periodically by the sweep of the light house beacon, squats with the phone and gazes down at her.</context>

      <context>Norman explodes backwards, slamming his head into the BRASS SHOWER NOZZLE. He staggers out of the bathroom before collapsing with a thud. The water finally rises above Claire's nostrils. Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and yank it free. The water slowly descends. When it seems that her lungs must burst, her mouth finally clears the descending water. She chokes in great gulps of air. The drug is finally wearing off. Claire sits up. Norman's unconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway. She turns off the water and stands unsteadily. She looks around for the phone and finally spots the little antenna protruding from under Norman. She delicately pulls the phone out of his back pocket, only to discover that it's been broken by his fall. She drops it and walks quietly out of the room.</context>

Just as she's free of the window, she jerks to a stop. She looks down and sees Norman, half out of the window, one hand clamped onto her ankle. There is a wrenching metallic creak. The truck lurches downward...then silence. IT DOESN'T SINK. The boat buoys it like a fishing cork as it drifts out into the lake. The headlights pierce the darkness of the steep underwater drop off. Claire tries to swim free, but Norman's not letting go. Suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trailer. It hurtles downwards and the still-glowing headlights reveal...</context>
