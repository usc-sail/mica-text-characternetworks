      <context>J.D. notices his friend pining over the photo.</context>
      <utterance>Get your ass ready! It's almost five o'clock and this bad boy needs to get his drink on!</utterance>
   <speaker>J.D.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>J.D. snatches the photo, and pulls out his lighter. Just as the flame is about to touch the photo, BILLY grabs it back.</context>
      <utterance>Oh God. Give me that. I'm burning it once and for all.</utterance>
   <speaker>BILLY</speaker>

      <utterance>Dude, it's been six months. You have to move on.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You know what'll cheer you up? Some hot chick riding your jock all night long.</utterance>
   <speaker>BILLY</speaker>

      <utterance>You're such a romantic, J.D.</utterance>
   <speaker>J.D.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It would help get your mind off of Sarah. BILLY ponders this for a moment.</utterance>
   <speaker>BILLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Whatever. Even if I wanted to meet other women, I wouldn't even know what to do. I've been out of the game so long.</utterance>
   <speaker>J.D.</speaker>

      <utterance>Sounds tempting, but I can't. Berenson needs me to update the financial models for his meeting with the foreign investors.</utterance>

      <utterance>No I don't. The Germans are taking an earlier flight back, so the meeting's been moved to tomorrow.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, why don't you just get somebody else to do your work then?</utterance>

      <utterance>I know, but something came up. I have to meet with some clients tonight, so I won't be able to get to it. It's your responsibility now. Okay?</utterance>
   <speaker>J.D.</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Dude, how do you think I get all my shit done? I'm telling you -- those Asian guys love crunching numbers. You probably just made his weekend. The guys have reached J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE.</utterance>
   <speaker>J.D.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And with that, J.D. presses a button in his car that causes the top of the convertible to go down and a funky white boy song kicks in. Intercut:</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Excellent, Kumar. I have to say you're one of the best applicants I've ever interviewed. Not that it's a surprise. Your father is very respected in his field. You know he and I had some pretty wild times when we were in med school.</utterance>
   <speaker>KUMAR</speaker>

      <utterance>Really?</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. WOODRUFF</speaker>

      <context>Kumar nods and smiles. Woodruff finally stops laughing...</context>
      <utterance>Yeah. We started our own basketball team-- the Hemoglobin Trotters...  Yeah, we were crazy.</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. WOODRUFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Anyway-- just one more question.  What are some potential symptoms of pancreatitis?</utterance>
   <speaker>KUMAR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a gurgle, and a cough -- the distinct sounds of somebody smoking from a bong. Dr. Woodruff is confused. Kumar pulls out his cell phone. It's his personalized ringer.</context>
      <utterance>Let's see. There might be epigastric tenderness, diffuse abdominal tenderness...</utterance>

<dialogue id="6" n_utterances="8">
   <speaker>KUMAR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Kumar stands up and answers his cell phone.</context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry. Can you hold on one second?</utterance>
   <speaker>KUMAR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dr. Woodruff is offended. He takes a sip of from a mug of coffee and watches as Kumar begins pacing around the office. Intercut:</context>
      <utterance>Kumar's phone. Kumar speaking.  Oh, hey.  Nothing important. I can talk. What's up?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm not gonna be able to partake in our usual Friday night ritual. I've gotta stay late at the office.</utterance>

      <context>Dr. Woodruff can't believe Kumar's choice of words.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know, but I gotta get this work done.</utterance>
   <speaker>KUMAR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dr. Woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply slips out of his hands. Hot coffee goes all over his shirt. Woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin.</context>
      <utterance>Oh come on! When has getting high ever prevented you from finishing your work?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Listen, I'd love to go home, but...</utterance>

      <utterance>Okay, where was I? Oh yes. More symptoms of pancreatitis. Um...decreased bowel sounds, possibly fever, dehydration, and sometimes even shock.</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. WOODRUFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mr. Patel. This is supposed to be a proper interview. Do you actually believe after the way you've behaved that I would ever even consider recommending you for admission?</utterance>
   <speaker>KUMAR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dr. Woodruff is flustered. He doesn't know how to react.</context>
      <utterance>No. I'd actually be pretty surprised.</utterance>

      <utterance>If I may interject for a moment...  I've been an employee here for three years now, and if there's one thing I've learned, it's that when you're craving White Castle, the burgers here simply won't cut it.  In fact, just thinking about those tender little White Castle burgers and those grilled onions makes me want to burn this place to the ground and re-build a White Castle in its place.  If I were you, I'd suck it up and make the trip. KUMAR looks at HAROLD. The guy makes a convincing case.</utterance>

      <utterance>Hey-- if you're looking for Maria, she left for Europe this morning.</utterance>

      <utterance>You must be that Chinese guy Maria keeps talking about.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>A HOT BLACK CHICK (AISHA), wearing only a bra and g-string, walks over to Luis and wraps her arms around him...</context>

      <context>Aisha kisses him, and walks away to the kitchen. Luis gives her a little a slap on the ass. Harold doesn't quite know how to respond to this.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, I'll be there in a second, baby. Do me a favor-- make me that omelette you were talking about. You know, with the sun-dried tomatoes.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Whatever. I'll tell my dad to reschedule it. He won't have a problem, as long as I'm taking it seriously for a change. Now, let's fly to Europe and find Maria!</utterance>

      <utterance>For a hot chick, ten days in Europe is the kiss of death. There are gonna be suave, sophisticated guys all over her. By the time she gets back, she may not be available.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Forget it. I'll just wait till she comes back. Harold starts to walk away from Kumar...</utterance>
