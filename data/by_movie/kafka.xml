      <utterance>The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.</utterance>

      <utterance>I gave it to him yesterday.</utterance>

      <utterance>You didn't give it to</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Did you see him?</utterance>
   <speaker>KAFKA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I've never seen him. I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.</utterance>
   <speaker>BURGEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's usually in the storage room sorting things out. He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.</utterance>
   <speaker>KAFKA</speaker>

      <utterance>He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?</utterance>
   <speaker>BURGEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Burgel just won't go away. Kafka tries to get on with his work.</context>
      <utterance>Who's to say he ever will? He's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- In fact, I'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.</utterance>
   <speaker>BURGEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.</utterance>

      <utterance>But</utterance>
   <speaker>BURGEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.</utterance>
   <speaker>KAFKA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They stare at each other with mutual antagonism.</context>
      <utterance>I'll commit that to memory.</utterance>
   <speaker>BURGEL</speaker>

      <context>He waddles away.</context>
      <utterance>Your position in this firm is not unassailable.</utterance>

Gabriela comes over with her bag, holding it out for him as Kafka puts the clothes in -- but not as many clothes as they thought. Behind the bundle, hidden at the back, is a briefcase. Gabriela recognizes it. Kafka sees her surprised reaction. He removes the case and carefully flips the latches. Inside, a complex mechanism, wires connected to a clock -- and a clump of dynamite.
