      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dmitri stops. His eyes glazed and frightening.</context>

      <context>As Dmitri come close, she moves toward him and kisses him. He blinks and snaps out of it and is quite happy that Anya is kissing him.</context>
      <utterance>Dmitri. I know you would never hurt me. You love me.</utterance>

   <speaker>DMITRI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>WE HEAR a howl from above and suddenly Rasputin jumps down. The reliquary tied to his waist, he's more furious than we've ever seen him - his face literally consumed with rage and hatred. Anya is terrified - but holds her ground as she did when she was a child.</context>
      <utterance>Anya... where are we?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANYA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Rasputin walks slowly toward Anya and Dmitri, burning with rage.</context>
      <utterance>I guess you aren't as powerful as you thought!</utterance>

   <speaker>RASPUTIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dmitri pushes Anya away and charges the much larger Rasputin, who knocks his aside with on swoop of big huge arm.</context>
      <utterance>Fighting for fair lady. How noble...</utterance>
   <speaker>RASPUTIN</speaker>
      <mode>CONT.</mode>
      <context>Rasputin turns to Anya climbing up a girder.</context>
      <utterance>And how pathetic.</utterance>
   <speaker>RASPUTIN</speaker>
      <mode>CONT.</mode>
      <context>Anya turns suddenly and kicks Rasputin in the face, which has the same effect as kicking a brick wall. Anya is thrown off balance and falls. Rasputin pushes her with his foot and she slides across the floor to Dmitri. Anya and Dmitri exchange a quick look as Rasputin, chuckling, advances on them. Anya reaches up and grabs Rasputin's beard, pulling his face forward so that Dmitri can give him a good roundhouse punch. The blow does little but enrage Rasputin. He reaches out and with one huge hand, picks Anya like a rag doll and takes her to the ledge.</context>
      <utterance>That's only going to make you fall farther.</utterance>
   <speaker>DMITRI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dmitri throws himself against Rasputin several times only to get batted away like a fly. Realizing this is futile, Dmitri slips through the FLOOR GIRDERS and scurries towards the edge... BELOW TEM. DMITRI POV: Rasputin's large boots above him, heading for the edge.</context>

      <context>They look up to see his right above them. Rasputin's boot SMASHES DOWN on Dmitri's hand, which grips the girder. Dmitri screams out in, but doesn't let go. He looks down at Anya and pulls her up while Rasputin begins to pry off Dmitri's fingers one at a time.</context>
      <utterance>What a touching sentiment...</utterance>

      <mode>CONT.</mode>
      <context>As Dmitri's last finger is preyed away, he falls but his grasp on Anya's hand is firm and she pulls him onto where she is standing. Rasputin leans over and bends toward them, three feet from Anya.</context>
