      <context>Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, kisses him. Then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds her shoes, slips her feet into searches them. And finally pulls away and sits up.</context>
      <utterance>Never did eat your lunch, did you.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings out of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. Sam watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery, humorous good mood. Throughout remainder of this scene, they occupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc.</context>
      <utterance>I better get back to the office. These extended lunch hours give my boss excess acid.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We could laze around here a while longer.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You sure talk like a girl who's been married.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sam!</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I've lost my girlish laughter.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The only girlish thing you have lost.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sam. This is the last time.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>For what?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>(he laughs)</context>
      <utterance>And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy!</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You can't laugh at it, huh?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Can you?</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window, tries to raise the shade. It sticks. He pulls at it. It comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares into the room, revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if corroborating Mary's words and attitude. Sam kicks at the fallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor again.</context>
      <utterance>Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have to go, Sam.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I can come down next week.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sam! No!</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised when they discover men will continue to want them even after the sexual bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly, places his hands gently on her arms, speaks with gentle and simple sincerity.</context>
      <utterance>All right.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You make respectability sound... disrespectful.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.  But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind. He moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems crushes away his good humor. There is a quiet moment.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I haven't even been married once yet!</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sam, let's go get married.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He looks at her, long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly, looks out the window and stares at the wide sky.</context>
      <utterance>I'll lick the stamps.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on. And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm thinking of it.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How can you even think a thing like that!</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't miss your plane.</utterance>

      <utterance>He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man... so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAROLINE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She rises, starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand.</context>
      <utterance>You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!</utterance>

      <utterance>Were there any calls?</utterance>
   <speaker>CAROLINE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She breaks off, distracted by the SOUND of the door opening. MR. LOWERY and his oil-lease client, TOM CASSIDY enter the office. Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a trifle pompous. Cassidy is very faced loud and has a lunch- hour load on. He is a gross man, exuding a kind of pitiful vulgarity.</context>
      <utterance>Teddy called. Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...</utterance>
   <speaker>CASSIDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary, tries to lead Cassidy toward the private office.</context>
      <utterance>Wow! Hot as fresh milk! You girls should get your boss to air-condition you up. He can afford it today.</utterance>
   <speaker>LOWERY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Cassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the desktop, smiles a wet smile at Mary.</context>

I want you to look at my baby. Eighteen years old... and she's never had an unhappy day in any one of those years!  Mary glances, cannot bring herself to smile or make some</utterance>

      <utterance>Not inordinately.</utterance>
   <speaker>CASSIDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He takes out of his inside pocket, two separate bundles of new $100 bills and throws them onto the desk, under Mary's nose. Caroline's eyes go wide at the sight of the glorious green bundles of bills, and she comes close to the desk. Cassidy leans terribly close to Mary, flicks through the bills, laughs wickedly.</context>
      <utterance>I'm buying this house for my baby's wedding present. Forty thousand dollars, cash! Now that ain't buying happiness, that's buying off unhappiness! That penniless punk she's marryin'...  Probably a good kid... it's just that I hate him.  Yup! Forty thousand, says here...  Casharoonie!</utterance>

      <context>He rises, reels toward Lowery's office, pauses, turns, speaks to Mary, meaningfully.</context>
      <utterance>Speakin' of feeling good, where's that bottle you said you had in your desk...  Oops!  Usually I can keep my mouth shut!</utterance>
   <speaker>CASSIDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lowery starts after him, pauses, turns to Mary. Cassidy has gone into Lower's office.</context>

      <context>Mary has put one bundle into a large envelope and takes the other from Caroline. When the bills are away, she puts the filled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed copies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office door, knocks, starts to open door as:</context>

      <context>Mary pulls her handbag up from the floor, where she'd placed it when she stretched out for sleep. She puts her hand in it, rummages for her wallet, cannot find it. The Patrolman is staring at her. She glances at him nervously, pokes in her bag a bit more, sighs, realizes she'll have to remove some of its contents. Nervously, badly controlling her fear, she takes out the money-filled envelope, and then the important papers envelope, filled then a couple of other items, places them on the seat, finally finds her wallet, opens it, hands it to him. He looks at the wallet, then at the car.</context>

      <context>Mary nods, starts walking along the line of cars as if making a selection. Her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand on the corner, just outside the lot. She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back into the car lot as she glances worried at the front page. As she goes, we see, coming up the street toward the lot, the same PATROLMAN. He sees Mary, slows, swerves over to the opposite side of the street, stops by the curb. Mary, engrossed in the newspaper, and walking back ease the lot, does not see the Patrolman. The car dealer is out on the lot now, standing and waiting for Mary. As she approaches, lost in her newspaper, he smiles.</context>

      <context>There is the SOUND of a door closing in that room up there. Mary has stood by the window, listening with mounting distress and concern and sympathy. She turns her face away now, gazes sadly at the little empty room. In a moment there is the SOUND of the house's front door slamming shut. Mary turns, looks out the window.</context>
      <utterance>Shut up! Shut up!</utterance>

Norman starts to follow, hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young woman and a motel room. Bringing down the tray of food, in defiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his defiance for one day. He cannot go into Mary's room.</context>

      <context>Mary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense. She takes up a small slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, nibbles at it in the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied. Norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles and then laughs.</context>

      <utterance>Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  Oh, I don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because... well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather... passive, to begin with... most of them...</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when. Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.</utterance>

It is bright with that drunken-like look of determination and encouragement and like resolve. He starts to clean up the table, pauses as he hears the closing of Mary's door in the cabin next door. He holds still, listens. He goes into the office and looks at the book.</context>

      <context>CAMERA, by this has reached the front door of the hardware store and we now see a girl standing just inside the door. She is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner, a look of purposefulness. She carries a handbag and a small overnight case. She is Mary's sister, LILA CRANE. Bob Summerfield has noticed Lila, smiles brightly at her, gives her an I'll-be-with-you-in-a-moment nod. Lila starts to walk toward the counter, never taking her eyes off Bob. As she approaches, she asks quietly:</context>

      <utterance>As I said, the mother...  To understand it, as I understood it hearing it from the mother... That is, from the mother-half of Norman's mind, you have to go back ten years... to the time when Norman murdered his mother and her lover.  He was already dangerously disturbed, had been ever since his father died. His mother was a clinging, demanding woman... and for years the two of them lived as if there was no one else in the world. Then she met a man and it seemed to Norman she "threw him over" for this man. That pushed him over the thin line... and he killed them both. Matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all... and most unbearable to the son who commit it. So he had to erase the crime, at least in his own mind.  He stole her corpse... and a weighted coffin was buried. He hid the body in the fruit cellar, even "treated" it to keep it as well as it would keep. And that still wasn't enough. She was there, but she was a corpse. So he began to think and speak for her, gave her half his life, so to speak. At times he could be both personalities, carry on conversations... at other times, the mother-half took over completely. He was never all Norman, but he was often only mother. And because he was so pathologically jealous of her, he assumed she was as jealous of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong attraction to any other woman, the mother side of him would go wild.  When Norman met your sister, he was touched by her... and aroused by her. He wanted her. And this set off his "jealous mother" and... "mother killed the girl." After the murder, Norman returned as if from a deep sleep... and like a dutiful son, covered up all traces of the crime he was convinced his mother had committed.</utterance>

   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Norman, for all the destroyed human beings of this world. Sam bends beside her, puts his arm about her, comforts her.</context>
      <utterance>Not exactly. A man who dresses in woman's clothing in order to achieve a sexual change... or satisfaction... is a transvestite. But in Norman's case, he was simply doing everything possible to keep alive the illusion of his mother being alive. And whenever reality came too close, when danger or desire threatened that illusion, he'd dress up, even to a cheap wig he brought, and he'd walk about the house, sit in her chair, speak in her voice... He tried to be his mother.  And now he is.  That's what I meant when I said I got the story from the mother. She thinks Norman has been taken away... because of his crimes. She insists she did nothing, that Norman committed all the murders just to keep her from being discovered. She even smiled a bit coquettishly as she said that. Of course, she feels badly about it... but also somewhat relieved to be, as she put it, free of Norman, at last.  When the mind houses two personalities, there is always a battle. In Norman's case, the battle is over... and the dominant personality has won. Lila begins to weep softly, for Mary, for Arbogast, for</utterance>
