MICHAEL PARKINSON, the highest rating talk show on TV.. CLOUGH (cont'd) You ever see eighty five or perhaps ninety percent of chairmen talking - I'd love a few chairmen on your programme occasionally - I believe the very sight of them brings the game into disrepute (some clap in the audience). And every time they open their mouths it kills it. Because the very thing they've given me a lot of stick about over the years - about talking too much and going on television too much, there are the very people who can put two words together and its rather embarrassing to me that a man - or men - can stop me talking to people like you. I love football. It's deep, it goes right down through. It's in every nerve, vein, you name it. It consumes me. And when I have to come and talk about I like the passions of football to come out.

      <utterance>Good evening. Tonight the football world was stunned by the news that Brian Clough has been sacked as manager of Leeds United. We'll be talking not just to Brian Clough, but also to the man he replaced, who's success he couldn't emulate, Don Revie. MITCHELL turns to CLOUGH.. MITCHELL  To Brian Clough first of all. What's your reaction to being sacked in this fashion?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Obviously, Austin, my initial reaction is one of shock at finding myself here with Revie...</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>...but in answer to your question, six weeks is hardly a long time to be given a chance in any job. I would hope Revie would get a lot longer time in his.</utterance>
