      <context></context>
      <utterance>It is so good of you to come.</utterance>
   <speaker>NOTABLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>An honor, Mrs. Teasdale... You must indeed have great faith in your new dictator to give him such a magnificent reception.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. TEASDALE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The notable kisses her hand once more and leaves the scene. As he does, the background group moves into Mrs. Teasdale. Their spokesman addresses Mrs. Teasdale.</context>
      <utterance>I feel that Rufus T. Firefly is the only logical successor to my dear departed husband. He has the statesmanship of Gladstone, the humility of Lincoln, and the wisdom of Pericles.</utterance>
   <speaker>FIRST CABINET MEMBER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mrs. Teasdale, as members of Freedonia's cabinet, we do not approve of your choice. Who is this Rufus T. Firefly?</utterance>
   <speaker>SECOND CABINET MEMBER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A stranger in our midst, an agent for the Eureka Ammunition Company. Think of it, Gentlemen, an ammunition salesman dictating the policies of our peace-loving country.</utterance>
   <speaker>THIRD CABINET MEMBER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Reconsider, Mrs. Teasdale, before it is too late. The citizens of Freedonia want a President!</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. TEASDALE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mrs Teasdale turns her back on them, leaving them to mumble among themselves. From off scene comes a servant's voice, announcing:</context>
      <utterance>As the widow of your last president, I have the right to choose -- and, Gentlemen, I refuse to discuss the matter any further.</utterance>
   <speaker>SERVANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Cut... to the archway. We see Trentino enter with a beautiful brunette at his side. He is followed by two or three of his fellowmen. He moves across the reception hall to Mrs. Teasdale, bows most graciously and presses his lips to the back of her hand, then introduces his companion.</context>
      <utterance>His Excellency, Ambassador Verdi Trentino of Amnesia!</utterance>
   <speaker>TRENTINO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mrs. Teasdale shakes the girl's hand warmly.</context>
      <utterance>Mrs. Teasdale... my niece, Vera.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. TEASDALE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis. Without his country's financial aid --</utterance>
   <speaker>TRENTINO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. TEASDALE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.</utterance>
   <speaker>TRENTINO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Trentino attempts to take her hand. The latter is a bit confused, much to the amusement of Vera, who laughingly says:</context>
      <utterance>Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.</utterance>
   <speaker>VERA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mrs. Teasdale's confusion is happily interrupted by the announcement of a servant, off scene.</context>
      <utterance>Mrs. Teasdale, my uncle's hopeless -- you've been the only topic of conversation ever since we left Amnesia.</utterance>
   <speaker>SERVANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The Honorable Mohamed Pandooh of Mufhtan!</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. TEASDALE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mrs. Teasdale exits from the scene quickly. Vera and Trentino look after her, then Vera laughs softly, as their eyes meet.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, I must greet His Honor.</utterance>
   <speaker>VERA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So that's the one you want to marry.</utterance>

      <utterance>With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --</utterance>
   <speaker>VERA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.</utterance>
   <speaker>TRENTINO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mrs. Teasdale enters the scene with Bob Firefly (ZEPPO). She introduces him.</context>
      <utterance>That's where you come in. I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece. Vera winks agreeingly.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. TEASDALE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ambassador Trentino... his niece, Vera, After the formalities of introducing, Trentino says:</context>
      <utterance>I want you to meet the son of His Excellency -- Bob Firefly...</utterance>
   <speaker>TRENTINO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Isn't it about time for the ceremony to begin, Mrs. Teasdale?  I do hope His Excellency won't be late.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>My father makes it a point to always be on time. As long as I've known him, he's never been late for an appointment.</utterance>
   <speaker>TRENTINO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But it's two minutes of ten now.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>His Excellency is due To take his station. Beginning his new Administration... He'll make his appearance when The clock on the wall strikes ten.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. TEASDALE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>When the clock on the wall strikes ten All you loyal ladies and you patriotic men Let's sing the national anthem when... The clock on the wall strikes ten. The clock begins to strike the hour... one... two... three... four...</utterance>
   <speaker>ALL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Again Groucho fails to appear and they all sing once more.</context>
      <utterance>Hail, hail, Freedonia... Land of the brave and free.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mrs. Teasdale exchanges an apprehensive glance with Bob. Vera and Trentino smile.</context>
      <utterance>Hail, hail, Freedonia... Land of the brave and free.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. TEASDALE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I hope nothing has happened.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bob goes over to a corner of the room and pulls a tapestried bell cord. This rings a fire bell in Groucho's room -- and Groucho is disclosed asleep in his canopied bed under a mosquito netting. He has an unlighted cigar in his mouth. The continued jangling of the fire bell awakens him from his slumber and he rises quickly. The cigar begins to emit smoke when he starts puffing. He hurries over to one corner of the room where his clothes are arranged in fireman fashion, gets into them, and then sides down a fireman's pole into the reception hall. The guests are singing the last two lines of the national anthem when he arrives.</context>
      <utterance>Mrs. Teasdale, I assure you there is nothing to worry about. Father is probably taking extra care in getting into his robes of state. I'll call him.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Groucho starts across the hall in the direction of Mrs. Teasdale. He passes several notables, one of whom is wearing an impressive looking medal. Groucho deprives him of it without stopping his forward movement, and pins it on himself. He pauses only when he is facing the principal group.</context>
      <utterance>Hail, hail, Freedonia... Land of the brave and free.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS.  TEASDALE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>GROUCHO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He takes a pack of cards from is pocket and extends them to Mrs. Teasdale.</context>
      <utterance>Never mind that stuff...</utterance>
   <speaker>GROUCHO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The bewildered Mrs. Teasdale complies. Groucho puts the other fifty-one cards in his pocket.</context>
      <utterance>Take a card.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. TEASDALE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What'll I do with this card?</utterance>
   <speaker>GROUCHO</speaker>

      <utterance>In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well. I heartily endorse everything you stand for.</utterance>
   <speaker>GROUCHO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I won't stand for much. And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon. Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling... six in behavior. Now who were the six? A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. TEASDALE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The future of Freedonia rests upon you. Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.</utterance>

      <utterance>I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?</utterance>

      <utterance>Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.</utterance>

      <utterance>You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.</utterance>

      <utterance>I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.</utterance>
   <speaker>TRENTINO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum... I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.</utterance>
   <speaker>GROUCHO</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?</utterance>

      <context>This is repeated by a servant's voice off scene... A servant enters to Groucho, bearing his high silk hat. He bows low as he hands it to Groucho... Groucho takes hat, removes a white rabbit, hands it back to servant, dons his hat and with a swanky gesture exits... again we hear a servant's voice calling: "His Excellency's car"... We see the trumpeters at the top of the steps of the mansion, outside, standing at attention... their trumpets at their sides... From inside comes the voice of a servant calling "His Excellency's car"... The trumpeters click their heels, draw themselves erect, put the trumpets to their mouths and blow a fanfare to summon the car... We cut to the Exterior of the Dictator's garage. This is a pretentious affair. In central foreground a wall, in the center of which is a large wrought-iron double gate. On each side of the gate is a crest or design in relief. Also two liveried guards stand erect before the gate. A trumpeter on the wall above. Through the gate we see the patio and suggestions of the garage. Two or three high-class cars in background identify the garage. At the beginning of the scene, we hear finish of trumpeter's call. Instantly the two guards move to the center of the gates and call through the bars -</context>

      <context>Harpo takes a phonograph record and smashes it on the ground... there is a roar of the motor -- the motorcycle starts off but leaves the side-car. Groucho gets out of side-car... starts back to steps, stops and says:</context>
      <utterance>To the House of Representatives... ride like fury... Don't stop for any signals and don't wait for a corner to make a turn... see if you can break a record...</utterance>
   <speaker>GROUCHO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As he dashes up the stairs, we CUT TO Harpo... riding along... A very attractive girl is coming along in the opposite direction. As she approaches Harpo, he toots his horn to attract her attention, she throws him a indignant look and continues on down the street. Harpo turns his motorcycle around and starts after her. She looks around, sees Harpo pursuing and breaks into a run... CUT BACK to Harpo following her, putting on speed... he lowers the Freedonian flag and simultaneously raises a pirate flag -- with skull and cross- bones on it, displayed prominently. A motorcycle cop is parked on the corner waiting for prospective violators... he sees Harpo chasing the girl and quickly starts his motor and follows in pursuit... The girl, as she reaches the executive mansion, rushes up the stairs in an effort to escape. Harpo comes into the scene and rides up the stairs after her... As Harpo gets about half way up the stairs the motorcycle cop is seen approaching the mansion. CUT TO reception room of mansion as the girl is running madly through the room... a moment later we see Harpo on his bike following... there is panic among the guests. Then we see the girl tearing up the stairs leading to the circular balcony... CUT BACK to Harpo. He looks behind him as he rides and sees the motorcycle cop following on his bike. On the balcony above, the girl is running, with an occasional glance over her shoulder as she runs out of scene... Harpo rides into scene. This time he is bent over his handle-bars in the manner of a six day bicycle rider... following closely behind him rides the motorcycle cop. They circle the mezzanine... Harpo in the lead, looking back now and then over his shoulder at his pursuer... this is done in imitation of a six day bicycle race... The motorcycle cop is closing in on Harpo... the latter approaching a large open door, rides through the opening, but the cop continues on around the balcony... as he gets to the opposite side of the circular balcony he passes another open doorway. Harpo comes riding out of it and is now in pursuit of the cop... CUT down stairs to Groucho... One hand is upraised holding a gun. As he looks at a wrist watch, he fires gun, then addresses guests looking into CAMERA.</context>
      <utterance>A fine thing -- leaving the head of the nation at the foot of the stairs...</utterance>
   <speaker>GROUCHO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>CUT BACK to balcony... Harpo is passing the cop... He holds up his hand for the cop to stop... they both come to a halt... Harpo gets off his motorcycle, walks over angrily to cop, takes out his book, writes out a summons and hands it to the cop as we FADE OUT...</context>
      <utterance>That concludes the nine o'clock sprints... Next Saturday night the winner of the six day bicycle race will receive ten thousand dollars in gold... the following morning we go off the gold standard...</utterance>

CUT to inside of private office which has another door leading to a hallway, and among other articles of furniture, there is an impressive-looking desk on which is a telephone. Just as Groucho comes through the door into his office, Chico enters through the other door. He is wearing gauntlets, reaching half way up his arms. As they walk toward each other the telephone rings and the two men make a mad dash for the telephone on the desk. Chico beats Groucho to the phone, picks up the receiver.</context>

Harpo picks up through telephone receiver, listens to conversation on the other end with an occasional nod and shake of the head. As he listens, he scribbles message on a piece of paper. He holds the written message up to the telephone receiver for a moment, then writes a few more words on the paper. During this, Chico and Groucho stand by, terribly worried.

He takes a swing with his own gloves, then takes a hefty swing with the gauntlet. He leaves his own gloves on the desk and exits with the gauntlets in is hand. CUT outside. Harpo is just pulling up to the curb in front of the House of Representatives, in his motorcycle and side car. Groucho comes from the building wearing gauntlets, gets into the side car and with a dignified wave of his hand, says:</context>
      <utterance>I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.</utterance>

Harpo is sitting innocently on the bench. The girl just interviewed by Chico comes from the office, sees the mouse, screams and joins in the general confusion. Groucho enters as the girls are running about - zig-zags among them and continues through the room into the private office of Chico - closing door behind him. The girls clear out of anteroom and Harpo is left all alone. He takes a small mouse trap from his large pocketbook, puts it on the floor, crouches down and whistles to the mouse in the manner of a man trying to call a dog. The mouse in answer to the whistle runs into the trap.</context>

He stops -- makes a terrible face -- takes out ear-muffs, puts them on his ears and he and Chico continue toward the box -- CUT TO other box -- the one that Chico and Harpo are headed for. Mrs. Teasdale and guests are being ushered in... Chico and Harpo come into scene, arriving at box. Chico steps into box from stage. Harpo is about to follow when he spies a pretty girl in box above. He starts climbing up the proscenium arch to upper box -- the girl sees him, screams and dashes out of box. Harpo completes climb into box -- at this point the singing has just finished and applause breaks out. Harpo acknowledges the applause as if it was in appreciation of his climb -- after a few quick bows he starts out of the box after the girl.

CUT TO box below - Chico is trying to reach for pocketbook on ledge but can't get it. He whistles up to Harpo. Harpo looks down and Chico pantomimes to him to get the pocketbook, pointing to it. The singing stops and aplause follows -- the orchestra starts a selection -- which continues through following routine without any singing. CUT TO box above. Harpo takes out a fishing pole with a reel on it -- he unwinds reel and the line descends near box below and lands in a man's hair -- the man occupies an aisle seat in the orchestra -- near Teasdale box. CUT TO Harpo reeling in. CUT TO man on aisle seat -- The hook has caught onto his toupe and its being pulled off his head. CUT TO Harpo reeling in with great satisfaction in the belief that he has the purse -- on the end of the line comes the toupe. Harpo, astonished, looks down on the victim who, minus the toupe, now displays a shiny bald pate. Harpo takes out his fountain pen and releases gadget. The ink pours down on the bald spot of the man below and spreads into the form of a toupe parted in the middle. CUT BACK to Harpo - he places the toupe on the bare back side of a figure of Cupid carved on the arch. He is now suddenly attracted by something on the stage -- it is a pool with a practical fountain in its center. Harpo digs into a decorative flower box set in a groove in the proscenium arch. He brings out a real live worm and baits his hook -- stands up and casts... the line swishes through the air and the hook lands in the pool on the stage. The line instantly tightens and a large carp fish is yanked out of the pool... as the line is drawn in the fish nearly hits Mrs. Teasdale. She covers her face with her hands. Chico takes advantage of her action, grabs the line, removes the fish, and puts hook on handle of purse... then signals Harpo with a whistle and in the manner of a construction foreman, motions to him to start "hoisting". The line becomes taut and the purse is yanked out of view. Mrs. Teasdale uncovers her face and discovers that the purse is missing.</context>

      <context>He makes a grab at Chico -- Chico passes the plans to Harpo - Groucho goes after Harpo - the latter leans away over ledge of box and holds the plans out over the stage. As Groucho is trying to reach for the plans, Vera dances into scene, makes a graceful pirouette and with her outstretched hands takes the plans from Harpo. As she dances away she deposits the plans in her bodice... Vera's male dancing partner enters from the wings, walks out about four feet - stops and strikes a pose with uplifted hand. Vera is dancing on the opposite side with her back turned. CUT TO Groucho back stage - he sees the dancing partner - pulls a lever on switchboard marked "TRAP DOOR" - CUT TO stage as the dancer disappears through floor. CUT TO shot of Vera - preparing to turn to join her partner - she reacts as she sees -- CUT TO Groucho standing on her partner's former spot holding the same pose ... CUT TO full stage shot. Groucho and Vera are dancing together. During the dance Groucho tries to get the paper. He bends her way over in an effort to make the paper drop out of her bodice. Harpo and Chico, watching the struggle, quickly tear off their capes and coats and leap from the box on to stage in their shirts. This develops into a four-cornered adagio dance. She hands the papers to Harpo over Groucho's shoulder as she dances with him... Groucho rushes to Harpo and they do a twirl together. Harpo hands the paper to Chico over Groucho's shoulder. Groucho rushes at Chico and twirls with him - Chico in trying to pass the papers to Vera drops them on the floor. They all make a dive for them. Groucho gets the papers and dashes with them to the lower box just as Mrs. Teasdale enters same. The following is a close shot of Groucho and Mrs. Teasdale. The latter standing on stage right by the box.</context>

TRUCK back disclosing Harpo on the other end of the bedcovers, trying to pull them off her... for a moment following, a tug of war goes on, Harpo pulling the covers about a foot his way and Vera pulling them back... The sound of Chico's second whistle coming over scene attracts Harpo, who lets go of the covers and runs out of the room. We pick him up outside of the room on balcony. Without hesitation he slides down the bannisters to join Chico who is waiting at foot of stairs.</context>

      <context>coming by land and sea -- Be off, my lad! With a grand gesture, Groucho exits out of scene. Harpo grips pommel of the saddle with both hands and in his attempt to make a flying mount, vaults clear over the horse landing on the other side. He lets down a rope ladder from under the saddle, climbs the ladder, mounts the horse and starts off. DISSOLVE to CLOSE UP of Harpo riding at breakneck speed. As he looks grimly ahead he reaches down out of scene and brings up a three-cornered colonial hat and puts it on his head. DISSOLVE to a Moving Insert - Harpo bringing the horse to a stop in front of a farm house. He blows a blast on a regular army bugle... immediately a few old men rush out of the house in their nightgowns, carrying guns, and into the scene from all directions rush other men, answering the call, similarly attired. Harpo starts his horse and we DISSOLVE to him pulling up to another farm house. This house has a single door on the extreme end of it and a very large French window covering almost the rest of the house. Harpo stops and sounds the bugle call. This time there is no answer to his call. He waits a second, then turns his horse in the direction of the house and rides through the single door. After a short pause, the doors of the French window fly open and the horse runs out pulling a double bed which is on wheels. Harpo is standing at the foot of the bed, braced against the bedpost, holding the reins. There is an old couple, man and woman, fast asleep in the bed - (This couple might be the blase gentleman and young wife used by Peter Arno in his cartoons.) After riding a few feet Harpo leaps from the bed onto the horse's back and rides off leaving the bed and its occupants on the road. DISSOLVE to Harpo pulling up to another farm house. He stops, sounds his bugle. A very pretty young girl, in her night clothes pokes her head out of the second story window. Harpo takes a good look at her, leaps off his horse and dashes into the house. A moment later he comes out of the house with a feed bag and puts it on the horse's head.... then he dashes back into the house again. Almost instantly he comes tearing out of the house, followed by an old geezer in his nightgown, who is chasing him, with rifle in hand... He fires a few shots -</context>

      <utterance>Mrs. Teasdale rises.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. TEASDALE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>CUT TO door, as it is being opened by two pages. Trentino and Vera enter. They both stop and bow in acknowledgment of the applause coming over scene. As they walk toward table and out of scene, Chico and Harpo enter. The latter is carrying a carpet runner, rolled up under his arm. He flips the carpet runner away from him on the floor, holding onto one end. It rolls out and Harpo strides majestically down its length toward the table with Chico following. Harpo pauses, brings to light a cuspidor from under his coat, puts it on the carpet and spits into it, and continues on, following Chico, who is now ahead of him. Harpo breaks into a run and he and Chico dash madly to the table. They take seats on either side of Groucho and without hesitating, start to eat the food in front of them. The guests are standing. Trentino and Vera arrive at their places and everyone sits down. Harpo reaches for a large service plate with a pretty picture on it, pushes his plate away, breaks the service plate with a knife... it breaks into little pieces like a jig-saw puzzle. He mixes the pieces up, and then starts to put them together again ... Groucho watches him... then helps him...</context>
      <utterance>My dear friends, in time of peace we should forgive those who fought against us, and so, I have invited our former enemies.</utterance>
   <speaker>GROUCHO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A waiter places a dish of tasty food in front of Groucho... he is just about to dig into it with his knife and fork when Harpo turns the table toward himself. This brings Groucho's food to Harpo, and Chico's empty plate to Groucho...</context>
      <utterance>No, no, this is the one...</utterance>
   <speaker>GROUCHO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Snapping his finger to waiter off scene. The waiter immediately appears placing a second dish in front of Groucho. He starts to dig his knife and fork into it again when Chico turns the table toward himself... This brings his food to Chico... Harpo lifts his plate up and puts it down again when the table stops turning... this time Groucho has nothing in front of him...</context>
      <utterance>That was awfully good, I think I'll have a second helping... waiter...</utterance>
   <speaker>GROUCHO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

      <utterance>It's delicious, Your Excellency.</utterance>
   <speaker>GROUCHO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He gives the table a quick turn and Trentino's plate disappears as it spins around toward Groucho... Just as it gets to Harpo, he lifts up the plate... the table goes on a few feet more and when it stops, Harpo puts down his plate and starts to eat... again Groucho has nothing... Groucho picks up his napkin and wipes his mouth.</context>
      <utterance>That's all I wanted to know.</utterance>
   <speaker>GROUCHO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Applause... Groucho steps up on the table</context>
      <utterance>I couldn't eat another thing.  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce to you a man who is a prince of good fellows, generous to a fault, his own worst enemy and a devil in his own hometown...</utterance>
   <speaker>GROUCHO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The table starts to turn slowly... Groucho starts to walk in opposite direction... staying in same place.</context>
      <utterance>Thanks, I didn't expect to be called upon... However, in conclusion I want to tell you that I promised Mrs. Teasdale I'd marry her if we won the war.... Well, we won the war and I'm stuck... to the victor belongs the spoils...</utterance>
   <speaker>GROUCHO</speaker>

      <utterance>Now is not the time for political temporizing, all interests must be sacrificed for the common weal...</utterance>
   <speaker>GROUCHO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This FADES OUT on a shot with Groucho running madly, and gesticulating, taking in Harpo and Chico turning the table...</context>
      <utterance>All those who want to place their money on the wheel, step inside, faint heart never won fair lady... Money won't grow in your pocket like the hair on your head and now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their party.</utterance>
