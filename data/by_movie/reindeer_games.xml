   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dozens of uniformed INMATES wander the yard, stamping feet, hands tucked away, breath frosting. Nick tries to light his cig, but the wind plays havoc. Nick curses, tosses it.</context>
      <utterance>Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nick laughs, stares through the fence at the gates of the prison's entrance road. Longingly.</context>
      <utterance>And some pecan pie.</utterance>

      <utterance>Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...</utterance>
   <speaker>RUDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nick grins. They stand there, shivering. It's freezing, but the time they get outside is too precious to give up.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nick studies him.</context>
      <utterance>All those pictures she's sent... y'know... you sure they're all of her, Nick? You hear sometimes they don't send their real pictures. Could be her cousin or something.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>

      <context></context>

   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, hey, listen here. "I've made my list and I've checked it twice, and as long as you're naughty, it's gonna be nice. These cold winter weeks have been killing me, Nick, as I lie here alone. It's not enough to have your warmth in my heart anymore; I need your warmth next to me. Work at Penney's has been busy because it's Christmas and that's when we do almost half of our business for the whole year -- ", okay, whatever, whatever --  " -- my manager's still mad at me for asking for the whole week off," whatever, whatever --  Here we go. "And all that gets me through the day is to close my eyes and imagine holding you, and kissing you, and touching you, and tasting you everywhere because I know at that moment, I'll feel I've found the reason for my whole entire life." Rudy still stares at the stone ceiling.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nick's doing pushups on the floor below, smoking a cig, reading sheets of pink stationery. With a new photo: of the same GIRL, in a bikini by a lake. Vamping a childish pose.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nick climbs off the floor, paces back to the bunks, marvelling at the latest letter.</context>
      <utterance>Sure as hell don't make me miss Millie Bobek. Guess I owe Millie, though. If I hadn't been rollin, her, I woulda never ended up here. And I woulda never met Ashley.  That's the world for ya.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nick drops the page on his stomach. Rudy sighs, picks it up, brings it to his nose.</context>
      <utterance>Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She's using a new perfume.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nick drops back to his bunk, pasting the new lakeside photo among his collage of pictures. Admiring his pen pal:</context>
      <utterance>Shoulda written, Rudy...</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Above, Rudy peruses the page Nick gave him. Some lipstick marks pressed to the paper. He passes it back, closes his eyes.</context>
      <utterance>Shoulda got yourself a girl.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thought you hated Sidnaw.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Just taste that Christmas turkey.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thought you hate your old man.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There's the echo of CRASHING metal gates. Prisoners YELLING. Nick smiles, still staring at his girl.</context>
      <utterance>Five years, Nicky. Five years.  I just want to go home.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

   <speaker>RUDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Across Broadway, a parallel line is forming. A tall, tattooed Native American, THE ALAMO, steps out of his cell. His hands are the size of a man's skull.</context>
      <utterance>Shit. Alamo's back.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't look like he missed the sunlight.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>At that moment, Alamo glances over. Finds Rudy's eyes. Rudy swiftly looks away --</context>
      <utterance>Aw, Rudy.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He slaps Nick an the back, heads back for their cell --</context>

   <speaker>UGLY STAFFER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The ugly staffer grins from under his plastic hairnet. Nick looks to Rudy, then turns back to the help:</context>
      <utterance>Swallow and see.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The ugly staffer curls his lip. Nick smiles. Rudy moves on, taking his tray off the rail and turning -- -- right into the chest of The Alamo. He looks up -- into the most scarred and vengeful face a man could ever dread to see. The Alamo's a lifer. Many times over.</context>
      <utterance>Just so you know, this man and I are outta here in two days. So while we're inhaling London broil and lobster bisque, you're gonna still be standing here smelling up the mystery creamfuck.  Who's in prison now?</utterance>

      <utterance>It wasn't me, Alamo --</utterance>
   <speaker>THE ALAMO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Alamo strides into the cafeteria line. Rudy finally takes a breath, as if he's dodged death. Nick's at his shoulder. They share a grave and worried look. Trying to help:</context>
      <utterance>That's when.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUDY</speaker>

      <utterance>No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't know, I've seen the business world.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Rudy shrugs. He checks across the room, on the whereabouts of The Alamo. The big Indian has his back turned.</context>
      <utterance>Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Next to Rudy, Zook has stopped eating. He is still as stone, staring at his tray.</context>
      <utterance>Ashley's talking about maybe we can start something up together...</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They both watch Zook put down his utensils and reach into his red-and-green jello with his bare hand.</context>
      <utterance>Whatsa matter, Zook?</utterance>
   <speaker>RUDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Gloppy gelatin drips from his hand, as the frail man lifts a large black cockroach out. Zook's shaking.</context>

   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <context>An INMATE at the end of their table picks up their table and overturns it, sending food flying. Rudy and Nick stand back, hands raised in surrender. Jello HITS Rudy in the face.</context>

   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The guard leaves them alone, runs on. The melee's still out of control. As Rudy turns -- -- and suddenly sees The Alamo charging across the room, with murderous eyes, a metal shank in his hand! Five feet away!</context>

It seems to me an intelligent society would legislate a second such gift-giving holiday, create, say, a Christmas Two -- late May, early June -- to further stimulate growth and prosperity. For who would protest such a holiday? Taking the fifty percent model, a Christmas Two would grow this country's annual per capita income by close to one-third.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Gabriel strides back to him, with two darts.</context>
      <utterance>So we're gonna have a contest.</utterance>
   <speaker>GABRIEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He lifts Rudy's shaking hand, puts a dart in it. Rudy's fingers are half-frozen, they don't bend. Gabriel has to wedge it in.</context>
      <utterance>We're each going to get one of these. Whichever one of us hits closer to the bullseye... gets what he wants.  You land closer, you get Ashley. And you guys get to go free. I land closer... and we start getting your help.</utterance>
   <speaker>GABRIEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Gabriel turns to the board, ten feet away, and tosses his dart. It thunks in the "13" wedge of the outermost ring.</context>
      <utterance>May the best sportsman win.</utterance>
   <speaker>GABRIEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He steps aside for Rudy. Rudy struggles to raise his hand, trembling badly. He focuses on the board, teeth chattering, tries to reposition his fingers, rears back and throws -- -- except the dart remains in his frozen grip. He brings his icy hand back, tries to move his fingers. And the dart finally tumbles out and hits the floor at his feet. Gabriel smiles, steps close.</context>
      <utterance>Damn.</utterance>

Rudy reaches for his jeans pocket, and pulls out-one of the game room darts, flecked with blood.</context>
      <utterance>We're gonna get you out of Detroit, Ash. Get you out of beauty and fragrances.  Remember that. After all this is over, when you know me, when you really know me... remember it was me.</utterance>

      <utterance>Nick. It's true that Indian gaming's gone a long way toward restoring wealth and pride to communities who've been economically isolated and enslaved for centuries. Stronger infrastructure, better schools, higher employment... they're all the results of reservation casino success stories. Still, many natives believe that these are temples to a godless materialism and greed that will only infect the souls of indigenous peoples until their love of money has destroyed the spiritual values their ancestors died to protect and their homelands have become no different from any United States suburb, satellite city or industrial park. Destroying the Indian legacy once and for all and leaving behind a nation of selfish, angry natives, of which I, it's true, am one -- -- as they hit the Tomahawk's doors --</utterance>

      <context>Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along. Nick reaches across him, releases the brake. Puts the car into "Drive." Turns to Ashley:</context>
      <utterance>I gave them me.</utterance>

      <context>Ashley steps toward the ramp, taking out a matchbook. Nick steps further into the trailer, to the back of the Nova.</context>

      <context>Rudy climbs the tire ramp. And pulls the trailer gate shut. He climbs into the rig's cab. Starts the engine. Puts the truck in reverse, taps the accelerator and hops out.</context>
      <utterance>...Rudy... help me... Rudy...</utterance>

      <context>The truck rolls backwards. And into the ravine. Rudy listens to its TUMBLING SOUNDS all the way to the bottom. He then looks up the road one way. Then the other. And notices the two money sacks sitting in the snow. He stares at them. A long time.</context>
      <utterance>...Rudy! Rudy! HELP ME!!!</utterance>

      <context>The Santa Claus shuffles inside, right past them. The Santa Claus sleepwalks straight for the dining room, finding a dozen RELATIVES, laughing and eating. A table laden with turkey and stuffing, gravy and cranberry, wassail and wine. The relatives stop still. The room goes silent. The Santa Claus sits down at the head of the table. Yes, it's Rudy. Without a word, he stares at the food before him. And takes a plate. He stacks it with meat and dressing and trimmings, and sets it in front of him. And digs in. Stuffing his face in silence. His Mother and Father return to the dining room, gaping. The other relatives look likewise. All staring at Rudy. Then, while he eats, without another sound... ...the Mother takes her seat at the table... ...and the Father pulls up another chair. They touch hands privately, and turn back to their plates. There's a CLANK of silverware, a SCRAPE of china, a CLINK of glass, and one-by-one, the relatives resume their meals. CONVERSATION picks up where it left off, SMILES return to the table, LAUGHTER slowly rises in the room. There is Mr. Duncan and Mrs. Duncan, Aunt Lisbeth and Uncle Ray, Aunt Mary and Uncle Pete, toddler Sasha and teenage Sam, brother Mike and his girlfriend Jill, sister Stacy and her husband Bill, Grandpa Walter, little Wendy Sue... ...and at the head of the table... Rudy Duncan. Home for Christmas.</context>
      <utterance>Son? Is... is that you...?</utterance>
