      <utterance>How do you do. My name is Penelope Ryan. This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I am Harold Ryan, her husband. I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier. I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer. I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society. Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?</utterance>
   <speaker>LOOSELEAF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Jesus--I dunno. You know. What the heck. Who knows?</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.</utterance>
   <speaker>LOOSELEAF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I dunno, boy.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You don't know?</utterance>
   <speaker>LOOSELEAF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It was a bitch.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you.  You can leave now. We'll begin.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>All but PENELOPE exit.</context>
      <utterance>Peace!</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This is a tragedy. When it's done, my face will be as white as the snows of Kilimanjaro.  My husband, who kills so much, has been missing for eight years. He disappeared in a light plane over the Amazon Rain Forest, where he hoped to find diamonds as big as cantaloupes. His pilot was Colonel Looseleaf Harper, who dropped the bomb on Nagasaki.  I should explain the doorbells in this apartment. They were built by Abercrombie and Fitch. They are actual recordings of animal cries. The back doorbell is a hyena, which you've just heard. The front doorbell is a lion's roar.  Would you let them hear it please?  Thank you. PAUL, her twelve-year-old son, enters from corridor, a sensitive, neatly dressed little rich boys.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And this is my son, Paul. He was only four years old when his father disappeared.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's coming back, Mom! He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I told you this was a simple-minded play.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>It's his birthday.</context>
      <utterance>Maybe he'll come back tonight!</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Stay home tonight!</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, Paul--</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're married! You've already got a husband!</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's a ghost!</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's alive!</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you, kind sir.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A what kind of doctor?</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A fairy--a queer. Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's an interesting piece of news.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're the only woman he ever took out.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not true.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Still lives with his mother.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You know she has no feet! You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How did she lose her feet?</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>In a railroad accident many years ago.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I was afraid to ask.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose. As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I didn't know that.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A lot of people don't.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't really know.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lion doorbell roars.</context>
      <utterance>To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace. Peace. Peace, everybody.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I hate that thing.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He goes to door, admits WOODLY, whom he loathes openly.</context>
      <utterance>It's beautiful.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're taking Mom out tonight?</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're going out?</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Take plenty of cigars.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We made the date three months ago.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun. I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She quit this afternoon.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We don't have a maid any more.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh?</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course. Not manly, you know. Did she try antihistamines?</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Throw out all this junk. Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Everything stays as it is!</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>My father!</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I apologize. But you didn't know him, and neither did I. How's your asthma?</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't worry about it.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How's the fungus around your thumbnail?</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's fine!</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's jungle rot! This room is making everybody sick! This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lion doorbell roars.</context>
      <utterance>No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I hate that thing.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He admits HERB SHUTTLE, who carries an Electrolux vacuum cleaner.</context>
      <utterance>Keeps fairies away!</utterance>
   <speaker>SHUTTLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHUTTLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is that a fact?</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That maid just quit. The place is a mess. You can start in the master bedroom.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Please--</utterance>
   <speaker>SHUTTLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>All freeze, except for PENELOPE, who comes forward to address the audience. Lights on set fade as spotlight comes on.</context>
      <utterance>I'll get ready, Herb. I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>SHUTTLE comes into the spotlight.</context>
      <utterance>Most men shunned me--even when I nearly swooned for want of love. I might as well have been girdled in a chastity belt. My chastity belt was not made of iron and chains and chickenwire, but of Harold's lethal reputation.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHUTTLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Doing what?</utterance>
   <speaker>SHUTTLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He'd kill me. He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Or was. We haven't done anything wrong, you know.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHUTTLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He'd assume we had.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's something I suppose.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHUTTLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All through the day I'm so confident. That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know? I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence. People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman. They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year. I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence. That's what charges them up.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm glad.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHUTTLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHUTTLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh. If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHUTTLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to myself, "My God--here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--" Pause.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes?</utterance>
   <speaker>SHUTTLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Something happens to my confidence.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHUTTLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong. I'm going to ask you to be my wife.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm touched.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHUTTLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's when I'll get my confidence back.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I see.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHUTTLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly. Good night.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Blackout.</context>
      <utterance>Good night.</utterance>

      <context>That's all?</context>

      <utterance>Hello. I am Wanda June. Today was going to be my birthday, but I was hit by an ice-cream truck before I could have my party. I am dead now. I am in Heaven. That is why my parents did not pick up the cake at the bakery. I am not mad at the ice-cream truck driver, even though he was drunk when he hit me. It didn't hurt much. It wasn't even as bad as the sting of a bumblebee. I am really happy here! It's so much fun. I am glad the driver was drunk. If he hadn't been, I might not have got to Heaven for years and years and years. I would have had to go to high school first, and then beauty college. I would have had to get married and have babies and everything. Now I can just play and play and play. Any time I want any pink cotton candy I can have some. Everybody up here is happy-- the animals and the dead soldiers and people who went to the electric chair and everything. They're all glad for whatever sent them here. Nobody is mad. We're all too busy playing shuffleboard. So if you think of killing somebody, don't worry about it. Just go ahead and do it. Whoever you do it to should kiss you for doing it. The soldiers up here just love the shrapnel and the tanks and the bayonets and the dum dums that let them play shuffleboard all the time--and drink beer.

      <utterance>When Penelope asked me to say something about dropping the bomb on Nagasaki, I didn't give a very good answer, I guess. It's a very complicated question. Jesus--you know? You have to explain what it's like to be in the Air Force and how they give you your orders and all that. What it feels like to be in a plane, what the world looks like down there. After I got home from the war, the minister of my church asked me if I would speak to a scout troop that met in the church basement. So I did. They met on Thursday nights. I used to belong to that troop. I never made Eagle Scout. But you know something? It's a very strange kind of kid that makes Eagle Scout. They always seem so lonesome, like they'd worked real hard to get a job nobody else cares about. They get a whole bunch of merit badges. That's how you get to be an Eagle Scout. I don't think I had over five or six merit badges. The only one I remember is Public Health. That was a bitch. The Boy Scout Manual said I was supposed to find out what my town did about sewage. Jesus, they just dumped it all in Sugar Creek.  Sugar Creek! That was a long time ago, but it's all coming back to me now. There was another merit badge you could get for roller skating. There used to be a roller rink at a bend in Sugar Creek, up above where the sewage went in. I got in a fight there one time. I had on roller skates, and the guy I was fighting had on basketball shoes. He had a tremendous advantage over me. He was a little guy, but he beat the shit out of me. I had to laugh like hell. Don't ever fight a guy when you've got on roller skates.  Jesus--I remember my mother used to make me chew bananas for a full minute before I swallowed--so I wouldn't get sick. Makes you wonder what else your parents told you that wasn't true.</utterance>

      <utterance>Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk! They had him planning air raids. A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan. There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself. Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He was a famous sniper. They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."</utterance>

      <utterance>We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane. Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire. Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire. That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards. The face turns a curious shade of avocado. I must ask the doctor why that is. At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.</utterance>

      <utterance>The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received. And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard. I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America. You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia." Blackout.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You'd better get Dr. Woodly.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Really?</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It is an emergency, isn't it?</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then get him.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He exits through front door, leaves door open. We hear him knocking on a door in the hallway.</context>
      <utterance>Okay.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>HAROLD enters, drained but recovering. He chews on a root. He has slept in the shirt and trousers he wore the night before. He is barefoot. PAUL knocks again.</context>
      <utterance>Dr. Woodly?</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There is the sound of WOODLY's door opening. WOODLY and PAUL speak unintelligibly, WOODLY evidently inviting PAUL in for a moment. WOODLY's door closes.</context>
      <utterance>Dr. Woodly?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's that all about?</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We thought a doctor might help.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Your old beau?</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We thought it was an emergency.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's a very decent man, Harold.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We all are.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Shouldn't you lie down?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>When I'm dead--  or fucking.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Paul said you were awfully sick.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He hears WOODLY's door open, is alert to WOODLY's approach, continues to speak to PENELOPE absently.</context>
      <utterance>I was, I was. It never lasts long.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>WOODLY and PAUL enter. WOODLY is correctly professional and carries a little black bag.</context>
      <utterance>The Indians call it "Zamba- keetya"--the little cloudburst.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ah! You're ambulatory!</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What a brilliant diagnosis!</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>You should be friends.</context>
      <utterance>You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends. I know you both, respect you both.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nothing would please me more.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank God!</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today? A touch of malaria, perhaps?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know malaria. Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You've been bitten by bats?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood. There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You have chills?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>WOODLY enjoys the joke and the blooming friendship.</context>
      <utterance>Chills, fevers, sweats. You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>I'm eating its cure.</context>
      <utterance>You can also describe its cure.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I was going to ask.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Pacqualinincheewa root.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Would you say that again?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Pacqualinincheewa root. Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I've never heard of it.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Congratulations. By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Are you've seen it work cures?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm so glad you like each other. I was so scared, so scared.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Have some.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you. Thank you very much.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I believe in miracles now.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Wasn't that sweet of me?</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people. Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We have, have we?</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Everything about you is the editorial we. Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.</utterance>

      <utterance>Please--</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles. You know who filled that bag for you? Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself. Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Good Lord.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>HAROLD suddenly goes to WOODLY, takes his hand and pretends abject gratitude.</context>
      <utterance>I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root. I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest. Now we cure you with it. Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>WOODLY withdraws his hand, examines it as though it were diseased.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, bless you, Doctor, bless you-- oh healer, oh protector, oh giver of life.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He doesn't deserve this! You don't know him. It isn't fair!</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I thought she was a widow.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You were wrong, you quack!</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Say hello to your mother.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do say hello to your mother.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now. She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tell her to have a nice trip.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>HAROLD laughs. This stings WOODLY to a cold, peace-loving anger.</context>
      <utterance>Thanks.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What for?</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He exits instantly.</context>
      <utterance>Quarantine, possibly. You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without. Goodbye.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now that's what I call fun.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>

      <utterance>You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again. You used to eat it up.</utterance>

      <utterance>I did?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again. What we need is a honeymoon. Let's start right now.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A trip, you mean?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I had a trip. We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>

      <utterance>Play?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>

   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A hundred dollars!</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The smallest thing I've got.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Can I get dressed first?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>PAUL exits to his bedroom. HAROLD turns to PENELOPE.</context>
      <utterance>Make it fast.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Honeymoon! Honeymoon! Say it: Honeymoon!</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's so--so stark.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>

      <context>PENELOPE wants to run, but doesn't.</context>
      <utterance>I'm not going to strike you. I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie. You mustn't run away now. This is your loving husband approaching. I'm your husband. Society approves!</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>HAROLD is very close now, but not touching her.</context>

   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Turn around?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>PENELOPE obeys.</context>
      <utterance>I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty. What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage. Turn around, turn around.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now. You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Relax. It's body time.</context>
      <utterance>You're thinking with your brain instead of your body. That's why you're so tense! Forget Norbert.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have a brain.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We all do. But now it's body time. Relax. Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods. Think of your muscles one by one. Let them go slack. Relax. Let the brain go blank. Relax. That's the idea-- that's my girl. Now the small of the back. Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>

   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A hundred dollars for breakfast?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Leave a tip.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have some change!</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He realizes at once that his violent side has severely damaged the side of him which is the great seducer. PENELOPE and PAUL are straight as ramrods.</context>
      <utterance>Ram it up your ass!</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lion doorbell roars.</context>
      <utterance>I do beg your pardon.  Those words were illy chosen. There is tension in all of us here. Something you must both understand, however, is that the head of this household is home, and he is Harold Ryan, and people do what he says when he says it. That's the way this particular clock is constructed.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>PAUL goes reeling to the door in terror, admits LOOSELEAF, who has also been sleeping in his clothes.</context>
      <utterance>Sometimes even I hate that thing.</utterance>
   <speaker>LOOSELEAF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Go home!</utterance>
   <speaker>LOOSELEAF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're right! We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles. I don't want to talk about tits. Go home!</utterance>
   <speaker>LOOSELEAF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Haven't got one.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And you went home unannounced, too?</utterance>
   <speaker>LOOSELEAF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Alice got married again.</utterance>
   <speaker>LOOSELEAF</speaker>

   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.</utterance>
   <speaker>LOOSELEAF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Otherwise, how are things?</utterance>
   <speaker>LOOSELEAF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive. Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered. She had her Goddamn knitting. I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yeah--cripes. I never did get any sense out of Alice. She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel. It was a bitch. You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy. Maybe not. I dunno, boy. That's civilian life for you. Who knows what kills anybody?</utterance>

      <context>PENELOPE exits dumbly, detesting the word "scrog," which she has never heard before.</context>
      <utterance>I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed. Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving. Do you mind?</utterance>

   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's what you're supposed to say.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This is not a coy deception. I do not want to be scrogged. I want love. I want tenderness.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You don't know you want. That's the way God built you!</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I will not be scrogged. I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It couldn't!</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Fish can't feel.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I can. Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me. I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would. But I've been sensitized. I have ideas now--and solid information. I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Such as?...</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tell me about its sexual roots.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted. It's just the truth.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I like the truth. I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Go on.</utterance>
   <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And they have very mixed feelings about women. They hate them in a way. One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently. They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You learned this in some college course?</utterance>

      <utterance>He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me. I'm now going to even that score. I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.</utterance>

      <utterance>No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation. Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring. He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace. He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes. He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet. That was very important to him. I did it. I tried to be a good wife. He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo. I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did. It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids. Any little kids.</utterance>

      <context>She exits clumsily, the way she came. Silence. Lights come up on the living room, which has become a pigpen. LOOSELEAF, HAROLD, SHUTTLE and PAUL sit around a dinner of nearly raw beefsteak set on the coffee table. LOOSELEAF wears an ill- fitting uniform, which he has rented.</context>
      <utterance>Two days later. The afternoon of the day of Looseleaf Harper's mother-in-law's funeral. You got it? Two days later.  You know what happened in Heaven today? There was a tornado. I'm not kidding you--there was a Goddamn tornado. Tore up fifty-six houses, a dance pavilion and a Ferris wheel. Drove a shuffleboard stick clear through a telephone pole. Nobody got killed. Nobody ever gets killed. They just bounce around a lot. Then they get up-- and start playing shuffleboard.  I never saw a tornado when I was alive, and I grew up in Oklahoma. There's this big, black, funnel- shaped cloud. Sounds like a railroad train without the whistle. I had to come to Heaven to see a thing like that. A lot of people got photographs.  After the tornado was over, a man had some film left and he wanted to take pictures of me--to use up the roll. I don't like people who go around taking pictures of everything. Nothing's real to some people unless they've got photographs.  Two days later--right?</utterance>

      <utterance>I dunno. Who knows? You know-- you're up there, and you're in some plane nobody ever flew before. You put her into a dive, and everything starts screaming and shaking, and maybe some pipe breaks and squirts oil or gasoline or hydraulic fluid in your face. You wonder how the hell you ever got in such a mess, and then you pull back on the controls, and you black out for a couple of seconds. When you come to, everything's usually fairly okay--except maybe you threw up all over yourself. It's just another job, but you try and tell Alice that.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yeah. I practically forgot. But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly. That belonged to everybody. Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun. After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"</utterance>

      <utterance>Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy. That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up. I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.</utterance>

      <utterance>Blue soup?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink. It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge. We laughed, we sang, we snoozed. When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried. We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach! I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"? Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36. All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup! Never stopped drinking blue soup. Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.</utterance>

      <utterance>The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed. It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893! He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I see.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You aren't going to hurt me. You aren't going to hurt anybody any more. Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don Quixote.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>My violin is avenged!</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And the hell with it. It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The new hero is you.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're too modest.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course. No more guns, no more guns.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Was I ever of use?</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>HAROLD picks up the rifle, considers it, offers it to WOODLY.</context>
      <utterance>Never. For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Here. Finish the job.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm utterly satisfied.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're making a mistake. Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded. You've wounded me.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>More clowning! Don't you see?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We never quit fighting until we're dead.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You'd be killing a friend. Don't you know how much I like you?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm going to shoot you now.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No!</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it. It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man. You can change!</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Like the saber-toothed tiger.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh God--you're really going to kill me.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>You'll like it there.</context>
      <utterance>It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee. Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If you want to be found that way.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What is this thing that kills me?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders. He will soon be extinct. It's time, it's time.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't shoot.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He aims the rifle tentatively.</context>
      <utterance>I've enjoyed being man.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No.  No.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Get up.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>HAROLD begins to squeeze the trigger, falters, lowers the rifle.</context>
      <utterance>Have it your way. We'd both be better off dead now.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Can't do it.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank God.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He turns his back on WOODLY, who stands shakily.</context>
      <utterance>Crawl home.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you--for my life.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's trash now, like mine.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>New lives begin!</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Tell him to be a healer, by all means.</context>
      <utterance>Somewhere in this city. Not here, not here. Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way. And Paul.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What are you going to do?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Leave the rifle here.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>HAROLD exits into corridor. WOODLY looks after him helplessly, apprehensively. Silence.</context>
      <utterance>For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>VON KONIGSWALD, MILDRED, and WANDA JUNE enter from the side stealthily. VON KONIGSWALD, pantomimes that his companions are to be quiet and to listen for something wonderful. All ghosts cup their hands to their ears.</context>
      <utterance>Harold?</utterance>
   <speaker>WOODLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There is a shot offstage. VON KONIGSWALD is delighted. MILDRED is sickened. WANDA JUNE is dazed. WOODLY collapses in grief. HAROLD enters from the corridor, shaking his head.</context>
      <utterance>Harold?</utterance>
   <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>VON KONIGSWALD expresses disappointment. MILDRED covers her face. WANDA JUNE sucks her thumb.</context>
      <utterance>I missed.</utterance>
