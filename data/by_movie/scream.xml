She steps back, spinning around to find... A GHOST FACE behind her as well, both of them approaching, closing in on her. Sidney starts to SCREAM when the two ghosts bust up LAUGHING, tearing off across campus.</context>

Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps.

Nothing...where the fuck is he? She takes a step forward when... TWO FEET step down from a toilet onto the floor in the last stall. Sidney's face draws tight as the stall door begins to CREAK open. She bolts forward, making a break for it...but slips on the wet floor...her feet flying out from under... Sidney reaches out...grabs hold of a sink...saves herself from falling...she glimpses a GHOST MASK in the mirror coming for her. A hand grabs her shoulder as she SLAMS her body through the exit door...narrowly escaping.</context>

      <context>The place is empty. A little suspicious he closes the door, catching his reflection in the closet mirror. He looks at the mask in his hands. Jesus, even he's jumpy. Two seconds later... ANOTHER KNOCK AT THE DOOR. Himbry grabs the door quickly, this time throwing it open. Again no one's there. He steps out into the outer office determined to catch a prankster.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere...eyes gauged.

      <utterance>No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Gale holds the gun firm, in total control.</context>
      <utterance>She looked dead. Still does.</utterance>
   <speaker>GALE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I've got an ending for you. The reporter left for dead in the newsvan comes to, stumbles upon you two dipshits, finds the gun, fumbles your plan, and saves the day. Sidney steps forward.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIDNEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Billy lunges at Gale, but she holds steady. Billy and Stu eye each other.</context>
      <utterance>I like that ending.</utterance>

      <utterance>She can't get both of us.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>In a mad rush, they storm Gale, heading straight at her. She pulls the trigger, but nothing happens...the safety is on. Billy charges forward, grabbing hold of the front door, SLAMMING IT SHUT. It catches Gale in the face, knocking her backwards out the door. She goes down...out.</context>
      <utterance>Odds are--she'll miss anyway.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Billy steps out the front door and retrieves the gun from where Gale lays. Then he turns back inside the house to find...</context>

      <context>Suddenly, the phone RINGS. Billy and Stu look at each other. Completely surprised. Billy scrambles over to the phone.</context>

   <speaker>BILLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Billy is fuming now...slightly staggering...and starting to lose it. He SCREAMS at Stu who has fallen to his knees.</context>

   <speaker>STU</speaker>

      <context>Billy throws the phone at Stu. He mouths to him, so Sid can't hear. "Talk to her..." Then Billy takes off for the kitchen. Stu takes the phone.</context>
      <utterance>I can't...I'm bad off, Billy. You cut to deep.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIDNEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Billy flies back in the room, grabbing the phone from Stu. He's completely nuts now, staggering, bleeding, totally insane.</context>
      <utterance>Peer pressure...I'm way to sensitive.</utterance>

   <speaker>SIDNEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Billy starts ripping the room up, overturning furniture in a mad fit of rage...when he notices the hall closet. Touche! He smiles deliriously, heading for it, ripping it open as... A GHOST MASKED FIGURE strikes from within, with an umbrella, the sharp end hitting him in the chest as it fans out. Billy stumbles back, stunned, as the GHOST comes at him again...the umbrella lodges in his chest, and he goes down. Sidney rips the GHOST MASK off her head. She looks at Billy, disgusted, throwing the mask on Billy's now still body. A movement behind her sends her reeling around to find... RANDY slowly sitting up. His body drenched in blood. He's alive...barely. He looks to Sidney...through pain...</context>
      <utterance>Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.</utterance>
   <speaker>RANDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Randy manages to stand when a FIGURE COMES LEAPING at him, completely unexpected...it's Stu...barreling into him...they fall back into the living room. Sidney grabs the gun next to Billy and turns to the living room to find... Randy and Stu rolling across the floor in a dead lock, fighting, both seriously injured...Sid tries to find aim when a... HAND GRABS HOLD of Sidney's ankle, toppling her to the floor...once again she finds Billy on top of her...</context>
      <utterance>You know what I hate most about horror movies? The final scene...it just goes on and on...and it gets so stupid...</utterance>

   <speaker>RANDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sidney grabs the gun from Gale.</context>
      <utterance>Careful. This is the moment when you think the killer's dead, but then he springs back to life for one last scare.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIDNEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She positions her foot on Stu's chest and aims.</context>
      <utterance>Not this time.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIDNEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She SHOOTS him in the forehead, a clean and perfect shot. The she aims the barrel at Billy who's eyes suddenly open, blinking up at her, blood bubbling from his lips. He's not yet dead. Their eyes lock.</context>
      <utterance>This is for my Mom, asshole.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIDNEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She FIRES another perfect shot. They're both goners. Sidney drops the smoking gun, standing silent over the bodies. A quiet moment when suddenly...</context>

      <utterance>This is probably an inappropriate moment, but you think you'd want to maybe go out with me sometime... like on a date?</utterance>
   <speaker>RANDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A long moment as Sidney's face goes from disbelief to resignation to the slight trace of a smile.</context>
