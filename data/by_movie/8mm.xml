      <utterance>Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife. What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe. They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city. Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone. Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her. The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.</utterance>

      <utterance>This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved. They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever. Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.</utterance>

      <utterance>First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer. It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet. Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants. It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em. But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes. No one knows where it comes from. That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth. Those are zombies, hardcore junkies. Their hands are permanently pruned. They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister. Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes. Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations. Interstate wire transfers. Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows? That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal. There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.</utterance>

   <speaker>DINO VELVET</speaker>

      <context>Welles obeys, helpless, dumps the bullets out on the table. The SILHOUETTED MAN'S getting closer. It's Eddie Poole.</context>
      <utterance>Shut up, cunt! Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>

   <speaker>DINO VELVET</speaker>

      <context>Welles attaches one cuff to the bed's iron rail, fastens the other cuff around his wrist. Dino puts down the bow and arrow.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Didn't know what to make of you at first, and you certainly had Eddie on pins and needles. But, lo and behold, from out of the blue came an old business acquaintance to explain everything... Welles looks across to the car... The sinister lawyer, Longdale, gets out from behind the wheel and hands the keys to Machine, walks this way...</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Eddie walks around the bed, studies Welles. Welles watches him. Eddie goes to stand behind Welles, rushes forward... PUNCHES Welles in the side of the head. Welles goes down, clutching his face.</context>
      <utterance>This is the fucker? Motherfucker, doesn't look like anything...</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Eddie pulls Welles to his feet, throws him against the bed, frisking him from head to toe. Longdale comes to stand beside Dino, nervous, taking out a tiny HANDGUN and pointing it at Welles. Welles looks up, holding his head, afraid, sits on the bed.</context>

      <context>Dino puts his fingers in his mouth, lets out a sharp WHISTLE. Across the warehouse, Machine uses the car keys to open the trunk of the car, pulls SOMEONE out... It's Max, beaten bloody, bound, face swollen, gagged, hardly conscious. Machine throws him to the floor.</context>
      <utterance>You're going to go get the film you received from Mrs. Christian, bring it here and put it in my hand. And to save time, so we make this as efficient as possible, there's an incentive...</utterance>
   <speaker>WELLES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <context>Dino takes out HANDCUFF KEYS, throws them to Longdale. Longdale approaches Welles carefully, unlocking him.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Eddie comes to SHOVE Welles. Welles stumbles to the ground, gets to his feet. Welles walks, takes one last glance back towards Max. Longdale follows.</context>

      <context>Welles rises suddenly, arm shooting forward, STABBING SCISSORS deep in Machine stomach... Machine ROARS, falling back, pitching forward... Machine's knife clatters to the ground. Eddie's eyes go wide. Machine hits the floor, clutching his guts. Welles pushes upwards with all he's got left, turns the iron bedframe onto its side, flipping the mattress off... Eddie moves forward, furious... Welles grabs Machine's knife, wielding it, holding Eddie off.</context>

Eddie runs for the gun. Welles pulls himself to the table, reaches for the gun, knocks the table over. He's got the gun, but... Bullets hit the floor as the table falls. Welles struggles to open his gun with his sole free hand, gets it open, holds it between his knees... Welles grabs a bullet... Eddie's running toward his gun, gasping for air... Machine's on his knees, pulling the scissors out with trembling hands... Welles puts the bullet in the gun, flips it shut, rises, taking aim across the warehouse...</context>

      <utterance>Hello, can you connect me with the duty nurse?  Hello, this is Lieutenant Anderson down here in the Thirteenth Precinct. I've got a helluva problem I was hoping you could give me a hand with. We had a stabbing incident a couple of days ago, and it looks like the supposed victim gave us a false name and address. Can you tell me if you had an adult male with an abdominal wound in you ER in the last forty-eight hours?  You'd remember this guy; a body- builder, real big guy, five foot eleven, with acne all over his chest and back...  Alright, thanks for your help.
