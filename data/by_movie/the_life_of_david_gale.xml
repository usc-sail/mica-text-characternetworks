      <context>The office is small, cheaply furnished. One wall is filled with neat rows of 8x10's of death row inmates. About 30 percent have red crosses over their faces. Five people wait in tense silence. A SKINNY COLLEGE GUY with a mullet and pinch of Skoal in his mouth looks at a computer screen. A co-ed cuddles a Styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs quietly. A matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding a phone to one ear. The clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12. CONSTANCE HARRAWAY (36), bookish, sits beside DAVID GALE (31). He wears a blue Yale sweatshirt. They both stare at nothing. She bites her lip.</context>
      <utterance>It's probably been about seven minutes...</utterance>
   <speaker>COLLEGE GUY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They all exchange looks: they've lost. David stands.</context>
      <utterance>Okay. Okay. We've got pronouncement. 6:12. Roughly eight minutes.  Number 36 this year for the Great State of Texas.</utterance>
   <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A PHONE RINGS. David controls himself.</context>
      <utterance>David, don't start throwing things.</utterance>

   <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She walks to the photo wall. With a red magic marker she marks a cross over the photo of a Hispanic male. The wall clock reads 6:13.</context>
      <utterance>Go. I'll do it. He nods to her, exits.</utterance>

      <context>The visitation hall has the linoleum-and-fluorescent feel of an empty school cafeteria. It is seamlessly intersected by curved wall of sheer glass. Across the hall a guard's booth is built into the concrete wall; the two guards inside look like they are in a sound booth. Every fifteen feet, the glass has small sound holes. On the visitors' side, chairs (with lap desks) cluster at each section. Just getting up from a chair in the hall's center is a big man wearing an expensive suit and black cowboy boots. This is David's lawyer, BENJAMIN BELYEU (late 30's). On the prisoner's side of the glass, a row of ten chairs trace the outline of its curve. Above each chair a microphone hangs from the ceiling. The center chair is in a stainless steel cage. Inside sits David Gale.</context>

      <utterance>Welcome back to 'Batter's Box.' Tonight we continue our very special four-part series with the Governor Hardin. Arguing capital punishment with her is DeathWatch coordinator, Professor David Gale. Governor, you're up.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's a nice liberal idea, but like most nice liberal ideas, naive.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>

      <context>Constance is biting her lip, breaks into a smile. The Governor is unsure how to react, then laughs. The host chuckles with her.</context>
      <utterance>It's a quote from you, Governor, from your first state attorney campaign.</utterance>
   <speaker>GOVERNOR HARDIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The host's laughter is overdone. David smiles. Constance bites her lip.</context>
      <utterance>You've got me, Professor. But let me, in my defense, give you a quote. Winston Churchill: 'If you're not a liberal at twenty, you've got no heart, if you're still a liberal at thirty, you've got no brain.'</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Governor, can't we examine the possibility that capital punishment isn't working. That murderers aren't deterred by the law because they have about as much forethought as lemmings. That it's expensive, inequably administered, that...</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Constance rolls her eyes. The Governor is ready for this.</context>
      <utterance>...that we may even be killing innocents.</utterance>

      <context>A beat. David doesn't respond.</context>
      <utterance>All righty, Mr. Gale, I'll play your game. Name one. Name one innocent man Texas has put to death in my tenure. One.</utterance>

Sometimes the bag was ripped off at the last second, you got a second chance. If not, you die knowing the 'key' to your freedom was inside you the whole time. A cheap-but-effective metonym.

      <utterance>Zack, what if Harraway's murder was just a means to getting Gale. I mean sending him through hell, a sick cat and mouse game. You kill the one person he has left. Make sure he sits six years on death row for the murder -- a place he's made a public career of loathing. And then just let him die, die knowing everyone will remember him with disgust. You destroy his loved ones, his life's work, his memory -- and you make him watch.</utterance>

      <utterance>We live to stop death. Eating, inventing, loving, praying, fighting, killing -- choose a verb. All to stall this evil, Job's 'king of terrors.' But what do we really know about it? Nobody comes back. There's a point, when your mind out-lives its obsessions, when your habits survive your dreams, when your losses... You wonder, maybe death is a gift. All I know is that by this time tomorrow, I'll be better off. What I don't know is why.  Goodbye, Bitsey.</utterance>

      <context>She turns and walks toward the highway. The parade tape has been replaced with crowd barriers. The drive's left side now overflows with abolitionists: They cluster beneath tarps, some sing hymns, others paint signs ("Don't kill with my taxes!", "Mark 6:10," "Murder doesn't Stop Murder!"). Beneath one umbrella stands a large black woman holding a candle -- she watches Bitsey. The right side is a media circus. Various pro-death penalty activists also cluster here. They too have prepared signs: "Rape and Suffocate Him!", "Thank Jesus for Justice," "'Let's Do it'." A blackboard keeps a countdown: "13 hours." At the end of the drive, on the left, Bitsey sees a sign leaning against a camper: "Save David Gale." It catches rain; its letters run.</context>

      <utterance>Why he was fired from DeathWatch, and the A.C.L.U.</utterance>
   <speaker>BITSEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Right. Maybe the plan was for Dusty to release the tape after Gale's conviction, after a year or so. You know, force him to dry out, let him play the heroic victim, give him back his dignity. So, Dusty Wright's sitting on this tape, waiting, the only one who knows about it. And maybe good ole Dusty starts to think that an erroneous execution is a hell of a lot more politically useful than a last-minute save.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Which would only prove the system works.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yeah. Almost martyrs don't count. What's one murder to stop thousands?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So he'll wait, release the whole tape after the execution.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Right. Somewhere he must have the original. What time is it?</utterance>

      <context>The old woman moves down the stairs. Dusty puts the aluminum suitcase on the doormat. From the duty-free bag he takes out David's Yale sweatshirt, lays it over the case. He RINGS the DOORBELL, turns and walks back down the hall. He stands at the top of the stairs, waiting for someone to answer before descending. Sharon (older than we've seen her) opens the door, sees the case and sweatshirt. She looks around, but Dusty is gone. She picks them up.</context>

      <context>David goes to Constance, kneels. He reaches down and with his thumb gently strokes her face through the plastic. He stands, turns and walks back to the camera. He reaches behind the lens to turn it off. A beat. Half his face fills frame, his watery eyes looking directly at us. In the other half, we see Constance's body. Black.</context>
      <utterance>Better go ahead then.</utterance>
