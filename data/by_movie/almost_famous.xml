      <mode></mode>
      <context>William nods, intrigued. He has a good disposition. The world of knowledge engages him, and he loves what it brings out in his Mom. There is a small clatter at the front door, as the girl we've just seen enters, barely brushing some chimes. She silently curses herself. ELAINE (cont'd) Anita, is that you?</context>
      <utterance>-- killed everyone off so her son Tiberius could inherit the throne.  Just like Nixon.</utterance>

      <utterance>I don't care what happens. I don't care if you put us on the cover. But you sent us a kid and... and he was a fan. And we all made friends with him - absolutely, to get a good story. But then we actually liked him. We thought he's... show us our lives in some mythic way and I guess... we're not mythic. We panicked.</utterance>

      <context>personally, as of 2 pm yesterday, on a voyage of self-reinvention. This is about William Miller. (counting off fingers) He lives with us, he lost his virginity, he saw us at our worst, appreciated our best, he saved two lives, including mine... he smuggled about a half-pound of pot into Boston, and we never even told him - Nearby, David Felton looks at another editor, raising an eyebrow. RUSSELL (cont'd) -- we told him too much, we told him everything... He almost died with us over Tupelo... if the band survives him, it'll be a miracle... but you know, he tried to keep up, and</context>
