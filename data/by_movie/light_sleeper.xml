      <utterance>Everybody wants to talk. It's like a compulsion. My philosophy is: you got nothing to say, don't say it. They figure you can tell a D.D. anything, things they would never tell anyone else. He understands. Of course they're stoned to start. If I could tie together all the hours of coke talk I've heard, that would be a lot of string. It was Robert's idea to add twenty-five dollars to home deliveries cause it's such a hassle. Fifty is more like it. Later. Narration continues as sedan drives through rain. Later. A Tribeca loft. LETOUR swaps drug jargon with TWO N.Y.U. STUDENTS at an impromptu party. Attractive ingenues drift by. TRENDY TWOSOME, blasted, sways, to techno-rap. Business done, LETOUR turns to leave. The FIRST STUDENT grabs his shoulder:</utterance>

      <context>JOHN accepts a coffee mug, sits on a sofa across from TERESA. Sunlight falls through crocheted curtains. TERESA ARONOW, fortyish, professionally young, is compact, demure; she wears business jacket and skirt, patterned blouse. Nothing about her is remotely paranormal -- nothing except, of course, her "aura." The "Other Side." Her voice is at the same time soothing, piercing. Teresa's West Village consultation room is startlingly mundane: a bourgeois walk-up. Upholstered furniture, Tiffany objts d'art, framed photos of her husband and children -- a trip to Capri. A twenties portrait of Madame Blavatsky, above the fireplace, centers the room.</context>

      <context>Inside, JOHN passes the MAŽTRE D', looks around: he's known here. Au Bar, a restaurant/club open 9:00 p. m. to 4:00 a. m., caters to the young, the rich, the European. He spots TIS with THOMAS, twenty-five, his handsome trainer, and TWO MODELS at a second-floor table. They exchange nods. LETOUR scans the room: suspicion is second nature. A laughing man (GUIDONE) at the bar catches his eye. He seems to blend: Italian, twenty-eight, silk suit, impeccable hair, accent -- but something's not right. His black shoes have rubber soles. LETOUR looks for a gun bulge, dirty hands. The ITALIAN turns; LETOUR glimpses his face: too pale. The ITALIAN averts his eyes. Glancing back, LETOUR walks up the stairs to Tis' table.</context>

You could get in for a gram, stay all night -- everybody, music people, movies, Wall Street, fashion -- even politics. I think like five marriages came out of those parties, babies -- really. God.  You stayed, you then Robert -- but he... I'da never thought you'd, what is it, twelve years? Others, lucky a year max, eight months, in, out, start using, unreliable -- nice kids.

      <context>The sedan continues south. It turns, stops in front of John's Chelsea apartment building. JOHN hops out, goes in. Inside John's apartment he -- a man possessed -- pulls his black tweed from the closet, throws it on the futon. He rolls up his shirt, reaches under the futon, removes the .38. He straps the gun to his back, wraps duct tape around his chest, end to end over the .38. He tucks in his shirt, puts on the jacket, checks the mirror to see if the gun shows: it doesn't. A pause to appreciate. LETOUR closes his diary, throws it out the window: a trifle. He slaps cologne on his cheeks -- annointing; heads toward the door. Outside, LETOUR emerges, walks quickly to the car, plops beside ANN. The sedan drives off. Back seat:</context>

      <context>She slaps THOMAS, pulls the 9mm from his waistband, throws it to the carpet. The CUBAN watches bewildered, gun drawn, awaiting instructions. Now ANN's on him:</context>
      <utterance>I told you greasy fucks I don't deal with guns! I see guns, I walk! How dare you?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And you, beaner, whoever the fuck you are, kiss my fat ass!</utterance>
   <speaker>ANN</speaker>
      <mode>(she spits on his shirt, knees him in the crotch, yanks his gun, throws it beside the gut- clutching CUBAN. She crosses the room, YELLING:)</mode>
      <context>THOMAS and the CUBAN TEEN retrieve their guns; ANN unlocks the door.</context>
      <utterance>That's it! TIS! Shitball! I know you're fucking there! Let this be a lesson! You wanna deal, you gonna apologize for this!  Let's go.</utterance>
   <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hold it! Stop right there. She turns defiantly. TIS enters from bedroom:</utterance>
   <speaker>TIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>TIS looks to THOMAS and the CUBAN: they lower their weapons. He only means to threaten LETOUR.</context>
      <utterance>No!  Sorry about the guns. My fuck-up. I was just trying to make a point -- I apologize.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Assholes. What a nightmare.  We'll make the deal tomorrow -- same terms. Ann. Sorry. Go on, leave, you're upset. I just need to talk to Tour a second. About a police matter.  Right?</utterance>
   <speaker>LETOUR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She hesitates.</context>
      <utterance>Go on.</utterance>
   <speaker>TIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tour and I need to get our stories straight. Somebody's talking to the police. The guns were for emphasis, to make a point, dumb -- ANN gets it. Fear hits:</utterance>
   <speaker>ANN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Opens door.</context>
      <utterance>We came together, we're leaving together.  Johnny, come with me.</utterance>

      <context>THOMAS fixes his gun on ANN.</context>

   <speaker>TIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't be stupid. Get out. Leave.  I had nothing to do with Marianne -- she jumped: she was there, then she was gone.  Nothing will happen to Tour. ANN computes, bolts out, flees, SCREAMING at the top of her lungs:</utterance>
   <speaker>ANN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>THOMAS, TIS, and the CUBAN stare dumbfounded. LETOUR reaches behind his shirt in the confusion, yanks out the .38 with a painful rip, turning, fires point-blank into the Cuban's chest. BLAM! Shirt fabric flares, flies: the CUBAN falls with blank expression. THOMAS, off guard, wheels and fires wildly at LETOUR. JOHN fires back. Both are hit. TIS ducks into the bedroom. THOMAS and LETOUR fire again, again -- hitting, missing. A bullet hits its mark: THOMAS, frozen, grabs his blood-spurting throat, slumps to floor. LETOUR bleeds from the stomach and shoulder. His shirt soaks red; he struggles to stand. CUBAN and THOMAS -- both dead. LETOUR checks the .38: five rounds fired -- one left. LETOUR staggers into the bedroom, finds TIS frantically searching an open suitcase. Off-screen VOICES under the fire bell.</context>
      <utterance>Fire! Fire! Fire! The fire bell rings.</utterance>
   <speaker>TIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>LETOUR steps to TIS, aims, shoots him barrel to forehead. Exit debris hits the wall. He is dead. Off-screen screams of guests are countered by commands from hotel security: "Get down!" "Get back!" Fire horns and sirens reverb from the street. LETOUR, losing consciousness, sits bedside. Gun slips from his hand. Deflating, he drifts back-first to the bedspread. Blood spreads. His eyes are open. POLICE VOICES approach.</context>

      <utterance>Sentencing's in ten days -- supposed to be. Because of the extenuating circumstances -- our cooperation -- they say it won't be more than five years -- maybe seven. With time served, good behavior, parole, I could be out in two years -- maybe. I hope.</utterance>

      <utterance>It's not so bad. It's a relief in a way -- at least so far. I've been writing, reading.</utterance>

      <utterance>Robert quit. He went back to dealing. I think he thought it would be less work, more money. It's lucky in a way I got mixed up in it -- now I have to see this thing through. So it's cosmetics after all.</utterance>
