      <utterance>She steps CLOSER to him... INTIMATE:</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A CHARGE between them. All they wanna do is KISS... But that'd be too easy. And those wounds of his, they haven't quite healed. He drops his eyes; SOFTLY NOW:</context>
      <utterance>You know.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A beat. She looks off. Nods. They say nothing. And now he slowly climbs back on his horse. Ella TOUGHENS:</context>
      <utterance>If I stay... it's not gonna be good for anybody, Ella.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Heard some rumors outta Abilene. Weird noises at night. Cattle mutilations. Weather phenomena. Figured I'd ride down there. Give it a look-see.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's 'phenomena'?</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ON JAKE. Every fighting instinct in him suddenly IGNITED, though he plays it down:</context>
      <utterance>Big storms in places that don't get big storms.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You goin' down there yourself?</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>You bet your ass he is. But, he shakes his head--</context>
      <utterance>Why? You worried about me?</utterance>
   <speaker>JAKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, ma'am. You can take care of yourself just fine.  Be seein' you around.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He gets back on his horse. Starts to ride off. Happy BARKS and trots alongside him. BARK BARK BARK. In dog that means "Don't be an idiot." Jake glances over --</context>
      <utterance>goodbye, Jake.</utterance>

      <context>He heels his horse, leaving Happy behind to WHINE. Jake rides off into the sunset. But his heart's KICKING in his chest. And this is pretty much where things usually end... But. Jake pulls the REINS as he SIGHS. Turns the horse around. TROTS back to Ella, whose smile WIDENS as he closes the gap between them. Finally STOPS right in front of her. And despite his best effort to stay TOUGH... he just plain likes her:</context>
      <utterance>Go on, GET.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAKE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He reaches out a hand... she takes it... as he PULLS HER UP INTO THE SADDLE. Ella grinning ear-to-ear as she folds her arms around his waist. Jake -- ever the outlaw -- grumbles:</context>
      <utterance>Abilene happens to be on my way.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAKE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He KICKS the horse and Happy follows. Ella shoots a goodbye look to Grey Wolf, who NODS.
