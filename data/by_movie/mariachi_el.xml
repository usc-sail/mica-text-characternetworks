      <utterance>Good morning, Azul. Do you know who this is?</utterance>
   <speaker>AZUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Moco... What the hell do you want after all these years?</utterance>
   <speaker>MOCO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We've got a lot to talk about. I'm just a few town away with a whole new gang. I heard you were nearby so I thought I'd give you a call, amigo.</utterance>
   <speaker>AZUL</speaker>
      <mode>V.O</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's sweet of you, asshole. I don't suppose you could get me out of there, and then maybe hand me over my share of money.</utterance>
   <speaker>MOCO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, I figured you'd want your money, my friend. That is why I have called you. I heard you were getting out soon, and figured I should deal with our situation. But do you really need me to help you get out? From what I hear, you're running quite a business out of your cell with a phone and some loyal men. It keeps you well protected I hear. Not a bad idea. I may try that myself sometime.</utterance>
   <speaker>AZUL</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I could stay in here and earn peanuts compared to what you owe me if I were to get out. So, yes, I want you to help me... my friend.</utterance>

      <context>Azul is walking towards his window at the sound of a truck racing in.</context>
      <utterance>Really? Well, that's more like it. Just like the Moco I used to know.</utterance>
   <speaker>MOCO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Just hang in there my friend. I won't forget that you have been a big part of our success. What's wrong.</utterance>

   <speaker>MARIACHI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The other drinkers stare at him. Glancing around the room, Mariachi notices a small, table- shaped object draped with a cloth in one corner of the room. Sitting directly behind him are four mean-looking dudes. Mariachi is served his drink.</context>
      <utterance>Refresco.</utterance>

      <utterance>I'm a mariachi. A good one. I play beautiful ballads, old classic ballads, on an old-fashioned guitar.</utterance>

      <utterance>I could add a little class to this place. I work for fairly cheap, I live mostly off tips. But I need steady work, and I can guarantee bringing in more customers.</utterance>

      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Mariachi picks up his guitar and lays some money next to his full drink. He looks disappointed.</context>

   <speaker>AZUL</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Azul opens the case and pulls out the MAC-10. The other two Mean Dudes are already reaching for their pistols. The Bartender ducks beneath the counter. Azul fires a million bullets into two of the Mean Dudes, (the other is holding the case in shock). Their chests explode, causing neat little dollops of flesh and blood fly everywhere.</context>
