      <utterance>It may be so. This much is probable: the men who sent us on this journey have long since been moldering in forgotten graves; and those, if any, who read this message are a different breed. Hopefully, a better one. He begins to roll up his left sleeve.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>He extracts a hypodermic needle from his breast pocket and injects it into the vein of his forearm. He continues speaking.</context>
      <utterance>One final thought -- nothing scientific, purely personal. Seen from up here, everything looks different ... Time bends and space is boundless. It squashes a man's ego. He begins to feel like no more than a mote in the eye of eternity. And he is nagged by a question: ahat if any- thing, will greet us on the end of man's first journey to a star? Are we to believe that throughout these thousands of galaxies, these millions of stars, only one, that speck of solar dust we call Earth, has been graced -- or cursed -- by human life?  I have to doubt it.</utterance>
   <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Taylor snuffs out the cigar butt and places it in the drawer beside the hypodermic. Then, flicking a switch Au cut off the Mozart, he rises and looks up again at:</context>

      <context>Dodge moves inland about ten yards, removes a small hand drill from his belt, extends the rod of the drill three feet and begins to take some subsoil samplings. Taylor begins to examine the contents of the three rucksacks. Landon sits down on the beach., hands around his knees, gazing moodily at the sunken spaceship. During this and succeeding scenes we sense that Dodge's obsession with scientific inquiry leaves him immune to fear: Landon is possibly more courageous and certainly more "human," for he has many fears to control: while Taylor -- detached, cool and misanthropic -- is something of an enigma.</context>
      <utterance>Take your soil test, Dodge. I'll check the equipment.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?</utterance>

      <utterance>Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?</utterance>

      <utterance>No, not quite, Landon. I'm a bit of a seeker myself. But my dreams are a lot emptier than yours.  I can't get rid of the idea that somewhere in the Universe there must be a creature superior to man.</utterance>
