   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The man gives him an annoyed look as the WHOOSHING gets louder.</context>
      <utterance>Do you hear that?</utterance>
   <speaker>GREYHAIRED MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hear what?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That noise.</utterance>
   <speaker>GREYHAIRED MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The man turns back to the book as the sound gets even LOUDER - - like it's coming closer. Jacob squirms in his seat -- sneaks a look at the man again. How can he not hear that? A STEWARDESS walks by and Jacob catches her attention.</context>
      <utterance>I don't hear anything.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Excuse me.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEWARDESS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The WHOOSHING is completely obvious now. The greyhaired man tries to ignore the two people talking over him.</context>
      <utterance>Yes?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What is that sound?</utterance>
   <speaker>STEWARDESS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's just the engines, sir.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The man sighs -- the stewardess smiles patronizingly.</context>
      <utterance>No, it's different. It's not the engines. It's getting louder.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEWARDESS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We're just gaining altitude to get above some rough weather. That's the sound of the engines speeding up a bit. Everything's fine.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The stewardess walks away as Jacob sits back and starts to bite his nails. The whooshing is really starting to BLARE now. He looks between the seats in front of him -- twists around to look behind. He snaps back to the greyhaired man. JACOB (cont'd) Can't you hear that?</context>
      <utterance>Um...okay.</utterance>
</dialogue>

<dialogue id="2" n_utterances="5">
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ALICE JOHNSON opens the door and sticks her head in. She's thirty-two, blonde, with a caring smile.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah..</utterance>
   <speaker>ALICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You okay, honey?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, Mom. I'm fine.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Alright. Better get cooking or you'll be late for school.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Alice closes the door as Jacob gets out of bed and stretches. Sunlight is leaking through the bedroom window shade and Jacob walks over to it. He reaches out and pulls up the shade. And there's nothing buy sky. Jacob frowns and pokes his head out the window.</context>
      <utterance>On my way.</utterance>
</dialogue>

   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Get the hell out of here! It's coming!</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jacob points down the street. The shroud is swooping down the road - browning out street lights in its wake. And the woman doesn't find anything threatening about this. Jacob screams at her.</context>
      <utterance>What's coming?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't you see it?</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And it's obvious now: she doesn't see anything. The Woman is totally oblivious to the danger. Jacob shakes his head -- stumbles away. The woman watches him go as the darkness PASSES OVER HER. She sighs. And begins to MUTATE. Her hair gets scraggly, her skin bursts out in sores, her back grows a hump -- all of which she DOESN'T seem to notice. She just shrugs her twisted shoulders. WOMAN (cont'd) Kids...watcha gonna do? She hobbles away with her dog - which now has six legs and two heads.</context>
      <utterance>See what?</utterance>
</dialogue>

<dialogue id="4" n_utterances="8">
   <speaker>FREDDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Freddy opens his mouth - lets out a large breath - and then INHALES an even larger one. A WINDSTORM starts, the source being Krueger's own lungs. The gale force begins to yank at the shroud surrounding Springwood. Fingers of darkness pull up from the town and towards Freddy's mouth -- and houses begin to DISSOLVE. Freddy continues to inhale like he's never going to stop. Krueger is sucking the black gloom into his body - and the entire town of Springwood is going with it. Trees, buildings, cars, picket fences. It's all crumbling and fusing, becoming a part of t cloud that itself is caught in the nightmarish wind tunnel, all piling into Freddy's mouth. The vortex swirls into Krueger. Then it's gone. Nothing but a vacant lot the size of a town remains. Freddy turns to Jacob and BURPS, it sounds like a THUNDERCLAP.</context>
      <utterance>Payback time...</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No!</utterance>
   <speaker>FREDDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Freddy reaches down and yanks up his red and green sweater. He pulls apart his putrid abdomen to reveal his guts - and a transparent stomach. Inside the stomach: a black swirling mass. Flashes of houses, people, homes, couples, all trapped in horrible anguish. Freddy drops down his sweater. FREDDY (cont'd) Springwood is mine, boy!</context>
      <utterance>Don't worry, I have a strong stomach.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I dreamed you away before I was born! Mom said you couldn't come back!</utterance>
   <speaker>FREDDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Freddy reaches his left hand into the bubbling tar at his feet, digs around a bit, then pulls out: ALICE. Jacob's mother. Tar dripping down her body. Krueger has her by the neck, waves his blades in front of her. Jacob gets up and runs toward him. Freddy pulls a foot up from the asphalt pit and KICKS Jacob back a good fifteen feet.</context>
      <utterance>Is that true? Then she told you all about me, huh? Let's see what else she has to say.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The boy rolls painful on the hard road. He sits up and screams:</context>
      <utterance>Run, Jacob!</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Leave her alone!</utterance>
   <speaker>FREDDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Freddy swings his knives out, pauses for a terrifying beat, then swoops the daggers towards Alice.</context>
      <utterance>You're such a momma's boy!</utterance>
</dialogue>

<dialogue id="5" n_utterances="2">
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You fucker!</utterance>
   <speaker>FREDDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly, between Jacob and Freddy, three SHAFTS OF LIGHT burst up from the road. Three FIGURES appear as the light dissipates. They're dressed in metallic black, heavy boots, helmets with dark visors covering their faces. One is large and muscular. The one in the center has an obviously feminine figure under her skin-tight outfit. The third is a little smaller than the other two with a slightly different face that allows us to see his mouth. They're the DREAM POLICE. Jacob doesn't know this yet, but Freddy seems to. The bastard son of a hundred maniacs frowns at the sight of these new apparitions. Then he looks past them and smiles at Jacob. FREDDY (cont'd) See ya later! Freddy violently DROPS down into the bubbling asphalt pit. Two of the black figures start after him. The third one turns to Jacob as his partners leap into the hole after Freddy. The sound from his exposed mouth is DEAFENING!</context>
      <utterance>Springwood is only the beginning. All I need from you is a ride!</utterance>

<dialogue id="6" n_utterances="2">
   <speaker>CLOSE ON YET ANOTHER SIGN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The sign pulls away to reveal a middle-aged man with an angry expression: MR. HOPKINS</context>
      <utterance>It reads: DRUG ADDICTS NOT WELCOME TO ROSEDALE!</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. HOPKINS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He walks along as we PULL BACK TO SEE</context>
      <utterance>Clean up your act somewhere else!</utterance>

      <utterance>What's going on?</utterance>
   <speaker>KAREN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Free speech. The right of assembly.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What is this place?</utterance>
   <speaker>KAREN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Karen hasn't looked at Jacob once. She suddenly seems to steel herself and walks away from the bush, towards the house. Jacob is befuddled.</context>
      <utterance>It's a home. A foster home. For teenagers. It's where you go when things get bad. It's the place to figure out what to do next. It's a home for kids that no one else wants.  It's MY home.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He stands there and watches.</context>
      <utterance>Oh...</utterance>
</dialogue>

<dialogue id="8" n_utterances="19">
   <speaker>MR. HOPKINS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Karen turns to him, still walking, flustered and hurt.</context>
      <utterance>Why can't you find somewhere else to shack up?</utterance>
   <speaker>KAREN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What have we ever done to you?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. HOPKINS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Karen turns quickly away from him and trips over a sprinkler head. Her groceries tumble onto the grass. A hand reaches down to help her. It's Jacob's. He quietly helps her re-bag her groceries as Mr. Hopkins looms above them. Both angry and embarrassed now. MR. HOPKINS (cont'd) Look, we've been here for years. This is a quiet street. We'd just like to keep it that way. Jacob can't take this guy anymore. He stands up and faces the older man with a scowl.</context>
      <utterance>Nothing...YET.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Lighten up, mister.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. HOPKINS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And what gutter did you crawl out from, kid?  We don't want your kind here.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>My kind? What kind is that?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. HOPKINS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Drug addicts. Dope pushers. We have stand up and take charge.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Swell. I've just got a couple of questions for you...Do you love your parents?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. HOPKINS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Of course I do...</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>

      <utterance>Are they alive?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. HOPKINS</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>My mother is.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jacob stares at Hopkins. He doesn't answer. He just huffs and puffs as Karen grabs Jacob and pulls him up to the front porch of the home, then into the floor.</context>
      <utterance>What's it like?</utterance>
   <speaker>KAREN</speaker>

      <utterance>Yeah. Thanks. I'm Karen.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jacob suddenly gets a little light-headed and has to use a wall to hold himself up. Karen looks concerned.</context>

      <utterance>Okay. You got three, maybe four days to rest up while we try and find a more permanent arrangement for you. But his isn't going to be a free ride.

   <speaker>FREDDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Freddy cranks up his knives and looms over Jacob. And three FLASHES OF LIGHT blast out behind the boy. Jacob rolls away as Freddy holds up an arm to block the blinding glare. The light fades. The DREAM POLICE have arrived. We'll call the small one SOUND COP. He stands there motionless as a loud and horrible GROWING noise emanates from his clenched teeth. This guy's bark is worse than his bite. The female in black is BLADE COP. From nowhere she produces two nasty-looking knives, one in each hand. She spins the blades in the air like an expert Samurai. The large one we'll call POWER COP. He reaches out for the dumpster, and with one hand sends it tumbling away with a CRASH. Freddy frowns. FREDDY (cont'd) Uh oh. Too many parking tickets. The Dream Police fan out around Krueger, surrounding him. Power Cop leaps at Freddy, grabs him and TOSSES him in the air. Freddy tumbles, rolls and bounces right back up on his feet. Right next to BLADE. She swings her knives. Freddy dodges. Swings hi own blades at her. She ducks. Freddy spins again. Right towards: SOUND COP. The short man in black opens his mouth and a sound like a foghorn at a rock concert BLARES OUT. The force of it hitting Freddy like a fist. Freddy bounces back. And once again he nimbly pops up. He glares at the Dream Police. FREDDY (cont'd) Don't interfere!</context>

   <speaker>FREDDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And Freddy starts to SPIN. Slowly at first, then faster and faster, until his image starts to BLUR. The Police circle the whirling image, holding back to see what will happen next. Krueger stops spinning. And his clothes are different. His red and green stripes have been replaced by black and white ones. There is a number printed across his chest. He's dressed like a CONVICT. Freddy grins. FREDDY (cont'd) Time to blow this joint. BOOM! A hole is suddenly blown in the high ceiling above Krueger. The building is suddenly filled with the beams of moving SPOTLIGHTS and the sound of blasting SIRENS. A rope falls down through the hole. Freddy grabs it and WHOOSH! he's yanked up. FREDDY (cont'd) You'll never get me, coppers! and away he's gone. After a few seconds the spotlights fade away and the sirens die. The Dream Police look up seemingly unsure of their next action. Then Power Cop kicks a pile of lumber, sending wood flying dozens of yards away.</context>

      <context>Power Cop turns to Sound Cop and flips up his visor revealing his face. He's a sixteen-year old black boy. Heavyset features, sweat dripping down his cheeks. He's KINCAID from NIGHTMARE 3. And he's pissed. POWER COP (cont'd) We try and save this guy's ass and then he goes off and cops an attitude. Sound Cop flips up his helmet. He's JOEY, the former mute boy.</context>

      <context>but finds that he can't move. The white blanket around him restraining him tightly like the straight-jacket on TV. He squirms and struggles. WESLEY (cont'd) Hey. He struggles harder now, but to no avail. He's wrapped tight, like a cigarette. ON THE TV the two orderlies torment the straight-jacketed lunatic, poking his face with their lit cigarettes. As the lunatic SCREAMS, the screams become magnified, again becoming that loud, deafening ROAR we heard before. Wesley squirms in his blanket/ straight-jacket, he jerks his head around, SEEING with each of the man's SCREAMS, the walls of the room SHUDDER INWARD and Wesley's EYES WIDEN with horror as he realizes not only is he TRAPPED like a sardine in his stark white blanket, but the walls of the room are starting to CLOSE IN on him. He SPINS back to the TV set, where: The first orderly is now looking AT US. Wesley REACTS as he notices something familiar about the man's face.</context>

Wesley SCREAMS and jerks his head away from TV and he HITS the floor with an ugly THUMP. The wind knocked out of him. He rolls. The couch is GONE. As he squirms and struggles to escape his white cocoon, the frightened boy looks around and sees that everything in the room - furniture, carpet, TV, even the door - are all gone, leaving just the white walls SLOWLY CLOSING IN ON HIM. Then we see that on the floor all around Wesley are long, cylindrical white objects. Clearly, they resemble GIANT CIGARETTES, and Wesley - wrapped neck-to-toe in his white blanket cocoon - looks just like one of them. He continues to squirm and SCREAM as the walls CLOSE IN from all sides -- closer -- CLOSER -- pushing the long white things toward him, around him, bunching them together until they are in a tight cluster, as the room CRUNCHES IN TIGHTLY, blocking whatever light source there is, until all Wesley can do is SCREAM one last time, and The screen goes BLACK. After a few beats, we hear a huge, deafening RIPPING SOUND, and a new LIGHT SOURCE appears as Wesley looks up, eyes wide with unspeakable horror as the giant, scarred face of FREDDY looms over him, grinning, and we:</context>

      <context>Gina is shocked and speechless. She backs away into a corner like someone trapped in a closet with the devil. Which is exactly what she is. Rising past the terror is Gina's realization that everything Jacob's been saying is true. FREDDY (cont'd) At your service. He punches one of the buttons and the elevator LURCHES. Gina grabs onto a wall as the lift races up and Freddy actually begins to WHISTLE nonchalantly.</context>

      <context>The elevator begins to slow. FREDDY (cont'd) Fourth floor. Overpopulation. The elevator stops. The doors begin to open. Gina leaps for the way out. But she's blocked. Blocked by PEOPLE. They fill the entrance to the lift and start to pile in. All kinds of people: businessmen, nurses, plumbers. And they're all ZOMBIES. Vacant expressions fill their dark hollow eyes as the zombies keep coming in. Pushing Gina back into the elevator. Filling it to capacity and beyond. The doors close and the elevator starts to move up. Twenty bodies are crammed into the tiny enclosure, smashed together, surrounding the poor teenager, drool oozing out of their mouths, breathing down her neck. SMASHING her so hard she can't even yell for help. Gina turns her head. WESLEY is pressed up next to her. A very dead look on his face. Begin squeezed by the zombies around him. One of his eyes POPS out of its socket. Gina finds the breath to scream and scream and scream. FREDDY (cont'd) Eight floor - the morgue. The elevator doors open and the mass of zombies starts to spastically pile out. Gina, having only been held up by the crushing bodies, falls to her knees as the last of the monsters exit the lift. She breathes in ripping gasps like she's having a coronary. But she sees the open door. And Gina jumps for the exit. Freddy grabs her shoulder and pulls her back violently. Gina falls to the floor again as the doors shut. Freddy waves his fingers down the row of buttons and stops above the very bottom one. This button doesn't looks like the others. It's in the shape of a little heart. Freddy turns and gives Gina a frighteningly serious look. FREDDY (cont'd) Time to go down, Gina. He presses the heart button. And the floor disappears. Gina falls SCREAMING into blackness as Freddy hangs in mid-air and</context>

Inside every fat person... RIP! Krueger's finger blades JUT out of the abdomen ad start tearing a huge SLIT up the front of his body.

On the other side is a dinner cart and a waiter behind it. The waiter is JACOB. CRASH! Jacob shoves the dinner cart into the room and into Freddy's gut, shoving Krueger across the room into a tumbled heap. Three EXPLOSIONS OF LIGHT BURST into the room. The Dream Police materialize. Freddy jumps up growling. Power Cop grabs him from behind. Blade leaps over to the bed and in a FLASH of steel, releases Gina from her satin bonds. Jacob yanks Gina off the bed and pulls her towards the door.</context>

      <context>He turns on the light and a RED HAZE blankets the room. Jacob looks up. The dish-like ceiling lamp is filled with blood. Jacob walks into the room, tears welling. He walks by Alice's vanity, her makeup still sitting there as if she might show up and use it at any moment. He steps up to a wardrobe closet and touches the edges of it lightly. He reaches out and slowly, almost reverently, opens the doors. Dozens of writhing SNAKES drop out of the closet and slither onto the ground. Jacob jumps back and SCREAMS. Then he just stands there in the middle of the teaming reptile mass, not giving a shit anymore, going insane. His fists clenched, his head tilted back, as he YELLS into the air like a wolf baying at the moon.</context>

He bolts over, grabs Krueger, raises him over his head like a wrestler, slams him down on the bar, and SHOVES Freddy, knocking glasses and ashtrays aside until he SMACKS into yet another poor wall. Krueger barely gets back on his feet when Power Cop is right on him again. The big man in black SWINGS, but this time Freddy DUCKS. CRACK! a support column bursts into dust. Freddy twirls around. And the two of them start to PUNCH each other. It's a barroom brawl between non-humans as Power Cop and Freddy Krueger exchange multiple blows. SMACK SMACK SMACK! Freddy nails Power Cop, whose head barely seems to budge from the hits. POW POW POW! Power Cop lays into Krueger, sending him spinning and tumbling only to pick him up and start the process all over again. This goes on for a while, and Krueger is losing. The mutant bouncer finally steps up to Power Cop to try and put a stop to all this.</context>

   <speaker>MUTANT BOUNCER</speaker>

      <context>THUNK! The brick lands squarely in Sound Cop's mouth, stretching it painfully and blocking it completely. Sound Cop reels from the impact. Tries to pull out the firmly wedged plug. Freddy turns back to Power Cop, BAM! Hits him down to his hips. The giant fist swings, BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM! like hammering a nail until Power Cop DISAPPEARS into the ground. Freddy's hand deflates to regular size as he turns to the struggling Sound Cop. Sound Cop's head is EXPANDING. Pressure seems to be building up, something's gonna blow.

      <context>A CRACKING sound makes Jacob stand up. Over to the now- silent bar entrance a BLACK FIST punches up through the cement. With a crumbling of granite, Power Cop rises from the earth. Something else moves behind Jacob and he turns, then SCREAMS. Sound Cop's headless body walks into the shot, his arms held ABOVE FRAME over his neck. Then Sound Cop's arms lower his dismembered HEAD onto his stump, push it down, twist it til it stays. With great effort, Sound Cop yanks the brick out of his mouth. Jacob now looks OFF SCREEN at something else, something that REALLY makes his eyes widen. We get to see the shadow of what Jacob sees, projected on the wall of the bar behind him. The shadow of the pile of body parts that was Blade Cop begins to MOVE. The pieces start to REFORM, leg to torso, arm to shoulder, head to neck. The shadow on the wall rises and we PULL BACK. Blade Cop stands across from Jacob, whole again except for a flash of exposed flesh on her abdomen to remind her of the experience. Jacob raises his eyebrows as the resurrected Dream Police step around him. JACOB (cont'd) Okay, I'm impressed Blade whips her visor up to reveal an upset girl's face.</context>

      <context>Krueger yanks his finger blades out and Jacob's limp body falls at Karen's feet. Karen shrieks and cries, dropping to her knees to hold him.</context>

   <speaker>KAREN'S FATHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Karen stares at him defiantly. And a HAND grabs Karen's Father, and yanks him away. We PULL BACK. KAREN'S MOTHER is next to the bed. Furious.</context>
      <utterance>But we're going to have the same fun!</utterance>
   <speaker>KAREN'S MOTHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And she SLAPS Karen's Father. He stands up, SLUGS her across the jaw. She tumbles back. Karen sits up.</context>

      <context>And Jacob RISES UP behind Krueger. GRABS him. Freddy DROPS Karen. She hits hard and rolls down the steps as Freddy turns, his knives swinging out and SLAMMING Jacob's gut one more time, IMPALING him against the wall. Jacob gasps out his final breath.</context>
      <utterance>Be honored, bitch. You're the last soul I need.</utterance>

      <context>Freddy pulls his blades out of Jacob and the wall. The boy's body hits the floor for the last time. Freddy turns back to the stairs and looks down them. FREDDY (cont'd) Where's my little pumpkin? He strolls down the steps.</context>

   <speaker>FREDDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <context>And with that, Underwood brings his fist down and JAMS it into Freddy's stomach. Right THROUGH IT. Shoving it into his very body. Freddy SCREAMS. Underwood violently pulls his fist out and there's SOMETHING in it. A shimmering flowing thing. Crackling with unworldly LIGHT. It's a SOUL. It's Wesley's SOUL. Underwood flings his arm out and lets go. Wesley's soul flies into thin air and DISSIPATES. Krueger's father brings his hand down again and RIPS out GINA'S SOUL. Again. JACOB'S SOUL. Freddy opens his mouth and shrieks. As Underwood raises his arms and begins to SPARKLE. FLASHES of light bounce around his body. He's changing. And something's happening to Freddy's too. Steam is rising from the creature. His feet are starting to flatten as he lays on the ground and BLACK GOO oozes from his pores. He's melting. And still screaming as he watches his foster father's image turn into: KAREN. An aura of LIGHT vanishes around her body as she lowers her arms with a victorious yet sad look on her face. Freddy DIES. A look of horrified realization burns in Krueger's eyes as he sees Karen and CONTINUES to scream inhumanly. His body dissolves, all of it liquefying into BLACK SLIME. Gone. Just a bubbling black puddle of gunk is left. His SHRIEK echoes through the room and everywhere else. Then the GUNK grows and changes into a dark cloud that begins to EXPAND. Power Cop runs up, grabs Karen and yells.</context>
