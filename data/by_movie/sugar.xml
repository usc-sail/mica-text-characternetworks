      <context>The BATTER lowers his head, helpless in the face of Miguel's overpowering fastball. FROM THE DUGOUT, Miguel's TEAMMATES CHEER him on. HEAD COACH REYES (dark-skinned, 30s) nods approvingly, CLAPS. BEHIND THE HOMEPLATE BACKSTOP, a dozen rookie players also in Kansas City uniforms cheer for their team. Two YOUNG PLAYERS clocking Miguel's pitches look at each others' radar guns, which read 92 and 93 MPH. As the next batter steps up to the plate, Miguel's catcher, JOSE (18), taps his index finger on his thigh, calling for an outside fastball. The next pitch is popped up on the infield between first and home. Miguel locates the ball, points to the sky, but Jose and first baseman, PEDRO BERROA, nearly collide, as the ball lands between them and the runners reach base safely. B1 FROM THE OBSERVATION TOWER, the ACADEMY'S DIRECTOR, LEANDRO B1 ALVAREZ (light-skinned, late 50s) and several other COACHES and SCOUTS jot down notes on their clipboards.</context>

      <context>C1 ON THE FIELD, Miguel glares at Pedro, who averts his eyes, and C1 kicks the dirt. Miguel looks in for the sign from Jose, nods, and delivers a tight fastball that sends the batter stumbling backwards to the dirt. Some players LAUGH and heckle the batter. Others point angry fingers at Miguel, who greets the batter back to the plate with a friendly, but authoritative, grin. He sends in the next pitch and the batter swings right through it, getting nothing but air.</context>

The other players erupt in amazement, while Miguel stares straight ahead. After a beat, he smiles wide.</context>

      <context>Osvaldo pauses for dramatic effect, as Miguel and Estella eagerly await what comes next.</context>
      <utterance>You ought to. Greatest Puerto Rican first baseman ever. But that's not why he's my favorite player... Back when he first arrived, 1951, 52, he was playing in the minors. Little Rock, Arkansas. So the story goes, one day before a game, Vic stops into this diner for lunch. Hadn't been here long, so he knew very little English. Didn't even notice the "whites only" sign hanging in the window. And Vic was Black. I looked him up on Google. I mean Black like you. So he sits down at the counter and the little waitress comes up to big Vic and says, "I'm sorry, we don't serve colored people."</utterance>
   <speaker>OSVALDO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>After a beat, Estella laughs, but Miguel is unsure. Osvaldo does his best to explain the joke in Spanish.</context>
      <utterance>So he leans close to the waitress, tells her in his best English, "That's okay, I don't eat colored people."</utterance>
