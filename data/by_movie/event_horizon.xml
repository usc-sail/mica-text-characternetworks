      <context>Lyle hands Weir a stack of hardcopy data. Weir reads the data with growing excitement.</context>
      <utterance>At oh-three-hundred this morning, TDRSS picked up an automated navigation beacon broadcasting at two minute intervals in Neptune orbit.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEIR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEIR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hollis answers drily.</context>
      <utterance>It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...</utterance>
   <speaker>WEIR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lyle looks at Weir, stunned by the request.</context>
      <utterance>A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.</utterance>
   <speaker>LYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEIR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.</utterance>
   <speaker>LYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEIR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.</utterance>
   <speaker>LYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lyle presses a button on Hollis' desk. An unholy GARBLE rips from office speakers: STATIC and NOISE and INHUMAN VOICES. Alone, each sound would raise the hair on your neck. Together, they are unbearable. The sound mercifully cuts off to STATIC. Lyle stops the tape. Weir sits there, stunned.</context>
      <utterance>Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.</utterance>
   <speaker>LYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEIR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The crew? Could they still be alive?</utterance>
   <speaker>LYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEIR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hollis stares at Weir, judging the man with his eyes.</context>
      <utterance>Someone sent that message. Admiral, you have to put me on that ship.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEIR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Weir leaves. The door closes behind him.</context>
      <utterance>Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.</utterance>
   <speaker>LYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're not seriously considering sending him?</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.</utterance>
   <speaker>LYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.</utterance>

      <utterance>He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.</utterance>

      <utterance>What was made public about the Event Horizon, that she was a deep space research vessel, that its reactor went critical, that the ship blew up... None of that is true.  The Event Horizon was the culmination of a secret government project to create a spacecraft capable of faster- than-light flight.</utterance>

      <utterance>The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...</utterance>
   <speaker>WEIR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.</utterance>
   <speaker>STARCK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How?</utterance>
   <speaker>WEIR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...</utterance>
   <speaker>COOPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Weir thinks of another way to explain it. He rips a pin-up from Smith's locker.</context>

   <speaker>WEIR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The crew stares at him. Starck decides to play.</context>
      <utterance>Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?</utterance>
   <speaker>STARCK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A straight line.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEIR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Weir folds the paper, lining up point A over point B... then THRUSTING his pen through both, skewering the pin-up.</context>
      <utterance>Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...</utterance>
   <speaker>WEIR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.</utterance>

      <utterance>So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?</utterance>
   <speaker>WEIR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.</utterance>

      <utterance>I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick.

      <mode></mode>
      <context>He hits Weir again. HARD. Blood gushes from Weir's skull, filling the runes on his face. Weir staggers. Miller attacks. Again and again and again... This time Weir is ready. He catches the scrubber and tears it from Miller's grasp. SMASHES Miller to the floor with a single blow. Miller GROANS.</context>

      <context>Miller gets to all fours, trying to get up.</context>
      <utterance>I'm not the Devil. I'm much, much older. I watched the Beginning and I will see the End. I am the dark behind the stars. I am the dark inside you all.</utterance>

      <context>Weir kicks Miller savagely. Miller slides through the coolant, comes to rest beneath a walkway. He attempts to rise, collapses back into the sludge. Weir slowly stalks towards him.</context>

      <context>...as Miller clears the surface, he holds something in his fist. Miller stares dead-on into Weir's hellish face... ...and raises his right hand. HE'S HOLDING THE DETONATOR.</context>
      <utterance>They are mine. And so are you...</utterance>
