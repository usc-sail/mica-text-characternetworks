      <utterance>No, it's a novel. Fiction. Although there's a lot from my own life, so I guess technically some of it is non- fiction.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. ERGANIAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Good, I like non-fiction. There is so much to know about the world that I think reading a story someone just invented is kind of a waste of time.</utterance>

      <context>Jack untwists the wire. Instantly the cork pops off, and a fountain of champagne erupts.</context>
      <utterance>That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.</utterance>

      <utterance>Jesus, what a day! Isn't it gorgeous? And the ocean's just right over that ridge. See, the reason this region's great for Pinot is that the cold air off the Pacific flows in at night through these transverse valleys and cools down the berries.

   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jack waves the glass under his nose as if it were a perfume bottle.</context>
      <utterance>Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jack now buries his nose in the glass.</context>
      <utterance>Don't be shy. Get your nose in there.</utterance>

      <utterance>There's not much there yet, but you can still find...  ...a little citrus... maybe some strawberry... passion fruit... and there's even a hint of like asparagus... or like a nutty Edam cheese.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>

      <utterance>Now set your glass down and get some air into it.</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They do so. Jack smiles.</context>

   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.</utterance>

      <utterance>Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.</utterance>

      <context>Miles reluctantly slaps Jack's hand. This causes the girls to laugh. MUSIC STARTS -- they're OFF!

   <speaker>WINE.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>-- Miles is too shy to look into Maya's eyes. She's interested and available -- it's too much for him. -- As Miles gets DRUNKER, the camera angles become sloppier, the cutting choppier. -- Miles PONTIFICATES about some aspect of wine that Maya and Stephanie find interesting. Left out in the cold, his jaw tight, Jack wants to find a way in but can't. -- Miles reaches over to refill his glass, but Jack's arm shoots out to stop him -- "Slow down." CLOSE ON MILES as a distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the rumble of an oncoming ANXIETY ATTACK. By now he has drunk so much that he spaces out, descending into --</context>
      <utterance>-- The four of them DRINK. Particularly Miles. -- Stephanie and Jack get cozier and cozier. -- The SALMON and DUCK arrive.</utterance>

      <utterance>Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.</utterance>

      <utterance>Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.</utterance>

   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...</utterance>
   <speaker>MAYA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAYA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Can I ask you a personal question?</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sure.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAYA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Miles laughs at first, then smiles wistfully at the question. He searches for the answer in his glass and begins slowly.</context>
      <utterance>Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Maya has found this answer revealing and moving.</context>
      <utterance>I don't know. It's a hard grape to grow. As you know. It's thin-skinned, temperamental, ripens early. It's not a survivor like Cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected. Pinot needs constant care and attention and in fact can only grow in specific little tucked- away corners of the world. And only the most patient and nurturing growers can do it really, can tap into Pinot's most fragile, delicate qualities. Only when someone has taken the time to truly understand its potential can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest expression. And when that happens, its flavors are the most haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the planet.</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?</utterance>
   <speaker>MAYA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What about me?</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't know. Why are you into wine?</utterance>
   <speaker>MAYA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah? Like what?</utterance>
   <speaker>MAYA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Miles laughs.</context>
      <utterance>Like what a fraud he was.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAYA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Now it is Miles's turn to be swept away. Maya's face tells us the moment is right, but Miles remains frozen. He needs another sign, and Maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches out and places one hand atop his.</context>
      <utterance>No, but I do like to think about the life of wine, how it's a living thing. I like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing, how the sun was shining that summer or if it rained... what the weather was like. I think about all those people who tended and picked the grapes, and if it's an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now. I love how wine continues to evolve, how every time I open a bottle it's going to taste different than if I had opened it on any other day. Because a bottle of wine is actually alive -- it's constantly evolving and gaining complexity. That is, until it peaks -- like your '61 -- and begins its steady, inevitable decline. And it tastes so fucking good.</utterance>

      <utterance>I fully realize that making a change like that might be tricky for certain people to accept at first, but life is short, Miles. I've got to be sure I'm doing the right thing before taking such a big step. And not just for my sake. I'm thinking about Christine's feelings too. I take marriage very seriously -- always have. That's why I've never done it before. The day I get married, it's going to be the real thing.</utterance>

      <utterance>Understanding of what?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Like I might be in love with another woman.</utterance>

   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.</utterance>

      <context>Miles turns and looks up to see Victoria, standing one step above him. Just behind her is her NEW HUSBAND. He exudes the quiet confidence of a successful businessman who played college football, takes expensive skiing and sailing vacations, and hasn't read a novel since high school.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, Miles.</utterance>

   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.</utterance>

      <utterance>Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.</utterance>
   <speaker>VICTORIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Just then a BLACK LINCOLN NAVIGATOR pulls up alongside the curb. The passenger side window is halfway down, and the sounds of Adult Contemporary Jazz waft out. Victoria gives Ken a little wave.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Miles's heart pounds.</context>
      <utterance>Thanks for your letter. I would have called you sooner, but I think I've needed some time to think about everything that happened and what you wrote to me. Another reason I didn't call sooner is that I wanted to finish your book, which I finally did last night.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAYA'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I think it's really lovely, Miles. You're so good with words. Who cares if it's not getting published? There are so many beautiful and painful things about it. Did you really go through all that? It must have been awfully hard. And the sister character -- Jesus, what a wreck. But I have to say I was really confused by the ending. Did the father finally commit suicide, or what? It's driving me crazy. And the title.</utterance>
