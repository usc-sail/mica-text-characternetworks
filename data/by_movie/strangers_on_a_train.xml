      <context>Guy nods with a polite half smile. Being a well known tournament tennis player, he has had this sort of experience before.</context>
      <utterance>I beg your pardon, but aren't you Guy Haines.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRUNO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Guy acknowledges this with a modest nod and turns to his magazine rolled up in is fist.</context>
      <utterance>Sure! I saw you blast Faraday right off the court in South Orange last season. What a backhand! Made the semi-finals, didn't you?</utterance>
   <speaker>BRUNO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I certainly admire people who do things.  I'm Bruno Anthony. Bruno. See Guy looks up. Bruno indicates his gold tie pin which bears his name in cut- out letters. Guy looks at it with the faintest expression of disdain. I suppose you think it's corny. But my mother gave it to me so of course I wear it to please her.</utterance>

      <context>The waiter has brought the drinks. Bruno slips the lighter into hip pocket to free his hands for the bills which he gives to the waiter, waving away the change. He offers a glass to Guy. Guy takes it.</context>
      <utterance>I have a theory about that. I'd like to tell you about it some time. But right now I suppose divorce Is still the simplest operation.</utterance>

   <speaker>BRUNO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But not against the law of nature. My theory is that everybody is a potential murderer. Didn't you ever want to kill somebody? Say one of those useless fellows Miriam was running around with?</utterance>
   <speaker>GUY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You can't go around killing people just because you think they're useless.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRUNO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, what's a life or two? Some people are bitter off dead, Guy. Take your -- wife and my father, for instance. It reminds me of a wonderful idea had once. I used to put myself to sleep at night -- figuring it out. Now, let's say you want to get rid of your wife.</utterance>
   <speaker>GUY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>BRUNO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Now here's the plan...</context>
      <utterance>Let's say she refuses to give you a divorce --  Let's say. You'd be afraid to kill her because you'd get caught. And what would trip you up? Motive.</utterance>
   <speaker>GUY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm afraid I haven't time to listen.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRUNO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's so simple, too. A couple of fellows meet accidentally, like you and me. No connection between them at all. Never saw each other before. Each of them has somebody he'd like to get rid of, but he can't murder the person he wants to get rid of. He'll get caught. So they swap murders.</utterance>

      <utterance>Since you sent me a key to your house, I decided to use it -- to make a little social call on your father. I thought he'd be Interested to know he his a lunatic son. The faintest flicker of Bruno's eyes indicates the intensity of his reaction. He stares hard at Guy.</utterance>

But why don't you go someplace where you can get some treatment? Not only for your own sake, Bruno, but you can't go on causing more and more destruction to anyone you happen to meet.</utterance>

      <utterance>Can you talk a little? Can you tell the chief you have my lighter?</utterance>

      <context>Guy nods without speaking, and with a half look in Bruno's direction.</context>
      <utterance>Is this your lighter, Haines?</utterance>
   <speaker>TURLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, you were right.  I'd better keep this for the time being.  We can clear the whole thing out the morning. How about staying in town over night, Haines? I imagine you have a lot to tell me. Nine o'clock, all right?</utterance>

      <utterance>There's one up near the entrance.  Who was he, Bud? Guy looks back sympathetically in Bruno's direction, speaks without looking at the boatman.</utterance>

      <context>He moves off through the crowd.</context>

      <context>She hangs up, turns slowly, to face Barbara and her father. Her expression is one of intense relief.</context>

   <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>With a sob, Barbara flings herself into Anne's arms. As she cries, Anne strokes her head comfortingly. Then with a half- choked sobs Anne, too, begins to cry. She speaks through her tears, looking over Barbara's shoulder at her father.</context>
      <utterance>Guy'll be back tomorrow.  He wants me to take him some things.</utterance>

      <context>Guy and Anne exchange a brief look, rise hurriedly and start to walk away before the conversation can go any farther. The cleric looks after them with a frown and a puzzled shrug of his shoulders, as if to say, "Did I say something wrong?"</context>
