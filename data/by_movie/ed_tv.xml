   <speaker>1	INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A GIRLS VOLLEYBALL GAME has just ended. It was a big game. Some kind of championship. ONE TEAM is CELEBRATING -- jumping up and down, squealing and hugging each other. We are focused on the bench of the TEAM TRAT LOST. They're very sad -- several are crying. One girl, in particular, (AMY) is really sobbing. She's sweat- stained, tired and just blubbering. Stuff's coming out of her eyes, her nose, her mouth and the camera is seeing it all. The COACH, a fortyish man looks at all the weeping girls -- Amy in particular.</context>
      <utterance>The following is shot DOCUMENTARY-STYLE.</utterance>
   <speaker>COACH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Now Amy is really a mess. She's crying, coughing, shaking.</context>
      <utterance>You quit! You gave up! He KICKS a CHAIR.</utterance>
   <speaker>COACH</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>The Coach storms off.</context>
      <utterance>You quit!!</utterance>
   <speaker>COACH</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>This IMAGE FREEZES.</context>
      <utterance>Qutters! ... Quitters! Amy is wailing and choking on her own tears.</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And that would be it. I don't think you need any narration at all. Just end it right there.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's horrible, it's depressing, I love it. What else?</utterance>
   <speaker>ALICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I want to re-pitch that pregnancy idea. Find six women early in their pregnancies and follow them all right through to the births.</utterance>

      <context>Mixed reactions, mostly negative.</context>

   <speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Silence. No movement at all.</context>
      <utterance>So let's go real. We find someone. Just a regular person, someone. And we put their life on television - live... all day long.</utterance>
   <speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Calm down.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEITH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What do you mean, like PBS did in the seventies? What was that family?</utterance>

      <utterance>The Louds.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEITH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah.</utterance>
   <speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>No one is wild for this. Some hate it -- some are unconvinced.</context>
      <utterance>No. We go way beyond that. We don't film it and edit it and put it on later. We go on the air live every morning and the show goes off each night, when our subject goes to bed. In between, we're on live all day, every day - the same person, -- for  let's say a month.</utterance>
   <speaker>FELICIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's not a show that's a surveillance camera.</utterance>
   <speaker>GREG</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You can't do that.</utterance>
   <speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Pause. The others know the argument is over.</context>
      <utterance>The hell we can't. Look, the beauty of being a cable channel is we can take chances. I've thought about this and I'm telling you, I think this can make a noise. A loud one. There are twelve thousand channels. You've got to do something that says "Look at me!" Hell, people look at fish tanks all day. This is people!  Someone's real life -- an TV, all day long - live... And, you know what? I'm doing it.</utterance>
   <speaker>GREG</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>In that case, we love it.</utterance>

      <utterance>Look it's not like we're burning up the airwaves now. We're running neck-and-neck with The Gardening Channel. If people just tune in to this twice a day for five minutes, we're a hit. Plus we can sell advertising every second, running at the bottom of the screen... and the beauty is this guy doesn't even have to be good. I mean if he's good, great. But if he winds up making an ass of himself, better. McILVAINE How is that better?</utterance>

      <utterance>Come on. People cannot turn away from an accident. You drive by, you say "Ooh, I hope there's not a head lying in the road" but you look ! See, nobody in America wants to be nobody. This guy wants to be famous. So, basically, the deal is he agrees to drive down the highway a hundred miles an hour blindfolded and we get to see if his head winds up rolling down the highway. Fun for the whole family. So let's do it.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you.

      <utterance>Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses.
