      <utterance>I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.</utterance>

      <utterance>Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.</utterance>

The bag drives forward towards the X-ray machine. Creasy pauses, then offers up a license from his wallet.</context>

The seven pieces laid together look remarkably like a well travelled Sig Sauer 226. Creasy smiles.</context>

He appears strong and decisive for the first time. Creasy very carefully takes the bullet, puts it into the magazine and chambers the round. He looks into Samuel's eyes.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>She turns and looks. It looks remarkably like her even under the hooded sweatshirt. She begins to run. Across the street, up the steps toward Creasy. A screaming train flashes beneath. Car headlights illuminate the bridge. Time stands still and the 'city sounds' fade out to nothing. She runs up the remaining stairs and sprints across the bridge. Her hood blows off revealing her full face. It's definitely Pinta. Camera ramps as he jumps into Creasy's arms. This is not the little girl we experienced in the beginning of the movie. The experience she just endured has been life changing. All of a sudden we have a 40 year old head on an 8 year old body. She wraps herself around him. He picks her up. We glimpse a simple tear on his cheek. They talk. But we do not hear the words. She notices her mom on the far side of the bridge. Creasy maneuvers her toward Lisa. Before she goes to her mother we hear:</context>
      <utterance>Pinta. Pinta.</utterance>
   <speaker>PINTA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Creasy nods. The inference is that he will see her in a few minutes. We start to hear Linda Ronstadt painfully, quietly on the wind singing "Blue Bayou." He continues to walk across to the opposite side of the bridge and gets into the kidnappers' car.</context>

   <speaker>PINTA</speaker>

      <context>There's a certain sort of calm of him. He closes the door, he lays his head against the back window. He looks out at PINTA at the other side of the bridge, where she's screams for Creasy. "Blue Bayou" gets LOUDER. Pinta now knows it was a lie. Creasy is not coming back. We're shooting through the glass of the back window. We se Mexico City reflected in the glass. As the car pulls out, time slows, and we see Creasy lay his head back and close his eyes as the car descends down into a dark tunnel. Pinta can see Creasy's face, eyes slowly closing. He can hear her screams before being enveloped by the night. As "Blue Bayou" continues...</context>
