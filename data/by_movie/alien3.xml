A computer virus was threatening to wipe away all recorded knowledge. There didn't seem to be any way it could be averted. In the almost forty years since we were towed out here in hypersleep, the news that came with occasional supply ships only got worse. Finally, the ships stopped coming. We had to resign ourselves to the fact that worst had come to pass, and the Earth no longer existed. Now she gives him that look.</utterance>

      <utterance>The order was more of a counter culture, a reaction to the Technology that was beginning to take over everyone's lives. It was a simple enough idea - Read, don't watch disk. Walk, don't pump more carbons into the air. The earliest members renounced technology. Started to collect the remaining books. Nobody would have noticed if it hadn't been for the Virus.</utterance>

      <utterance>After a scare like that, thousands flocked to our retreat. People started clamoring for written information. For our books. They abandoned the modern ways --</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I told them. After the supply ship's stopped coming I saw no point in keeping up the charade. Since I was a sort of walking reminder of technology, they cast me down.</utterance>

      <utterance>That's probably what they thought when they built me. But my brain is cyber- organic - patterned after the human brain - it functions the same way a human brain does. It accumulates random images and sensations during waking hours, but unlike the human brain that sloughs them off during sleep --</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Right. Maybe they've fixed this on later models, but I don't. Do you know what happens to the human brain when it is deprived of sleep? It starts to run off the dreams while you're awake, as hallucinations. Same thing with me. For twenty years I absorbed data on this planetoid. A little after we lost contact with Earth the visions started. They thought I was insane. I had to explain that it was because I was an android. They liked that even less.</utterance>

      <utterance>I, Brother John Goldman of the orbiter Arceon, Minorite abbey and gaol, know the Abbot was wrong. There is a great evil here. I have seen it. I put pen to paper now lest this plague - this creature stills my hand. I have gone down below - both to try to warn the others and get the woman - Ripley - get from her some clue as to how to battle this evil, or at least to make my peace for not defending her. She believes there is still and Earth and I hope she is right. I hope she will be able to find out. I hope she can find some rest for the devils that torment her.</utterance>
