      <context>TIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with the woman. PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost back into the numbers on his computer screen. The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shell-shocked. HEATHER (cont'd) Eric Dale?</context>

      <context>PETER is very nervous.</context>
      <utterance>So Mr. Sullivan why don't you tell me what you think is going on here, and please speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever, I didn't get here on my brains I can assure you of that.</utterance>
   <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an associate in the risk assessment and management office at MBS</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN TULD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now you lost me at M...</utterance>
   <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sorry...</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN TULD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I was joking Mr. Sullivan.</utterance>
   <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes... Well as you probably know over the last 36-40 months the firm has begun packaging new MBS products that combine several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security. This has been very profitable as I imagine you noticed.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN TULD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have.</utterance>
   <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day. The problem, which is I guess why we are here tonight, is that it takes us... the firm... almost a month to layer these products correctly thereby posing a challenge from a risk management standpoint.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN TULD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?</utterance>
   <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But the key factor is these are essentially just mortgages, so that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably beyond what you might be willing, or allowed to do in any other circumstance, thereby pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN TULD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And how far have we pushed that profile tonight Mr. Sullivan?</utterance>

      <utterance>We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion dollars... at MBS alone.</utterance>

      <utterance>Now Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing, and give me a little rope here, what I am guessing that your report here says is that considering the, shall we say bumpy road, we've been on the last week or so that the numbers that your brilliant co- workers up the line ahead of you had come up with in the past don't seem to make much sense anymore considering what's taking place today?</utterance>
   <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Actually not taking place today but what's already taken place over the last two weeks.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN TULD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So what you're saying is it's already happened?</utterance>

      <utterance>Sort of.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN TULD</speaker>

      <utterance>Well... sir... if those assets were to decrease by just 25 percent, and remain on our books... well... that loss would be greater than the current market capitalization of this company.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN TULD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So what you're telling me Mr. Sullivan is that the music appears to be about to stop and we are going to be holding the biggest bag of stinking shit ever assembled in the history of capitalism? Everyone looks back at PETER. JOHN TULD  Mr. Sullivan?</utterance>
   <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well sir, I'm not sure I'd put it that way but let me clarify using your analogy, what this model shows is the music, so to speak, just slowing, if the music were to stop, as you put it, then this model would not be even close to that scenario. It would be considerably worse.</utterance>

   <speaker>SAM ROGERS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>early this morning, I know yesterday was pretty bad, I wish I could say that today is going to be less so but that isn't going to be the case. Now I am supposed to read this statement here to you all but how bout you read it on your own time and I'll just tell you what the fuck's going on here. THE LAWYER looks at JARED then they look at SAM, he continues. SAM ROGERS (cont'd) I have spent the night here meeting with the executive committee and the decision has been made to begin to unwind a considerable portion of the firm's holdings in several key asset classes. The crux of it is... in the firm's thinking the party is over as of this morning. There is going to be considerable turmoil in the markets for the foreseeable future. They believe that it is better to have this turmoil begin with us... as a result the firm has decided to liquidate the majority of its position of fixed income MBS today. An assistant starts handing out info packets to each of the traders in the room. SAM ROGERS (cont'd) You should be getting a breakdown right now, you will see the accounts you are responsible for today. I'm sure it hasn't taken you long to understand the implications of this sale on your relationships with your counterparties and as a result on your careers. I have expressed this reality to the executive committee and they understand. As a result, if you are able to complete a 93% sale of your assets you will receive a 1.4 million dollar one off bonus.</context>

It's just money, it's made up, a piece of paper with some pictures on it so we don't all kill each other trying to get something to eat.
