      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm concerned about our Program. It's always been a source of pride to our students and alumni, but two straight so-so seasons are having a damaging effect on our fund-raising, both public and private.</utterance>
   <speaker>WINTERS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then stop raising the entrance requirements on me. We never could have gotten Alvin Mack in here under the new guidelines.</utterance>

      <context>Wilson points to a representation of a football field affixed to the wall. A football rests on the 40 yard line, which is marked 160 million. The end zone (60 yards away) is</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>At a time when we're committed to a 400 million dollar building program, alumni donations are down 15% the last two years. Because they've also voiced their displeasure to their legislators, we can expect a corresponding drop in state funds.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The Athletic Fund is suffering too. Season tickets sales are off, merchandising's slow...</utterance>
   <speaker>WINTERS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You layin' all this at my door? There's been a recession on.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHANCELLOR WILSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, but the heaviest drop has been from the big donors, the 100,000 dollar club. These people are recession proof. They sit in my box every game, and they're much more generous when we're ranked and going to bowl games. Two of them, as you know, are on the Board of Regents, including the Chairman.</utterance>

      <utterance>What are you trying to say to me, Grant? After 12 years, my job's in jeopardy?</utterance>
   <speaker>CHANCELLOR WILSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm not prepared to discuss your job right now; I just want you to be aware of the situation. The alumni and the legislature are unhappy and they vote with their checkbooks. I don't pretend to be an expert on football, Sam, and I'll deny that this conversation ever took place, but I do know we need to win next year.</utterance>

      <context>Coach Winters stops, looks up at the effigy. Humes and Clayton fear an outburst, a display of rage.</context>
      <utterance>Tickets are in your coat. Itinerary and player profiles are in your briefcase. We got a 9:00am tomorrow in Philly with this kid Darnell Jefferson.</utterance>
   <speaker>WINTERS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>That's it. He strides on. Humes and Clayton race to catch up.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Darnell, you have the potential to start for us as a freshman. That 108 yard kickoff return you made against Taft? One of the greatest runs I've ever seen a high school player make. Now, Michigan is set at tailback for two years. You won't play till you're a junior. With Joe here gettin' you the ball, runnin' 28 Thunder right, you'll be All-American with us as a Sophomore.</utterance>
   <speaker>REVEREND WALLACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, but I'm really more concerned with Darnell's education. He came here late. He's got some catching up to do.</utterance>
   <speaker>WINTERS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This gets a little chuckle from the Reverend. It was intended to.</context>
      <utterance>Believe me, education is the first priority in our program. That's why all the players are smarter than me. After all, a football coach is smart enough to understand the game, but dumb enough to think it's important.</utterance>

      <context>Bud takes a good-natured swipe at him. Lattimer deflects it. Joe notices Bobby looking over at Louanne. She gives Bobby a surreptitious little wave to come over and sit with her. He gives her the "just a minute" sign.</context>

      <utterance>These people are full of shit. You see, football is not like life.  It's better. More exciting, more intense, more fun. In life, people are always wondering how they measure up; whether they're getting ahead or fallin' behind. In football, you know. Every week you get a chance to show what you're made of, a chance to demonstrate the physical and personal qualities that all those poor bastards who can't play this game are left to agonize about.</utterance>
   <speaker>WINTERS</speaker>

      <utterance>Any football program worth the name is a special brotherhood, an elite corps of warriors, a select group of knights. That first time our starting unit takes the field, the first time we huddle up; that's our inner circle, that's our Round Table. If I were an upperclassman, I'd be real nervous about my seat, cause we got some very talented new-comers this year. Guys who want a place at the Table.  This is the trophy one of our freshman, Darnell Jefferson, won as a Pennsylvania State High School First Team All-American. You know what this says to me?</utterance>
   <speaker>WINTERS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He smashes the trophy on the podium, breaking it in half, shattering the base. Darnell and the other freshmen are agog. The upperclassmen stifle laughs, particularly Ray Griffen.</context>

      <utterance>I'm sorry, Darnell, but I've already been assigned. You're gonna have to find somebody else. I'm tutoring Scott Sherman.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yeh he would. I'm a bigger prospect than Sherman.  He's a lineman on the scout team.</utterance>

      <context>Darnell is genuinely hurt by this dose of reality. His customary bravado melts away.</context>
      <utterance>And you don't ever use them right. Pretending to be smart is not the same as being educated. Or erudite. It's just a con. And it makes you sound stupid, no matter how big a prospect you are.</utterance>
   <speaker>DARNELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Autumn, disarmed by his sudden humility, has no real rebuttal. She would have had to tutor him anyway, but now she's having trouble being angry about it.</context>
      <utterance>O.K... even more reason for you to be my tutor. You already taught me something.</utterance>

She turns and storms away up the hill, as we hear a TRAIN WHISTLE. Joe watches her go, then starts down the hill toward the tracks as the train comes into view. Camille stops, turns back, sees Joe headed for the tracks, starts to worry. Joe reaches the grade and steps into the middle of the tracks facing the oncoming train. Horrified, Camille runs down the embankment toward him.</context>

Under the train, we see Joe desperately hugging the ground, head down, toes dug in, hands clutching the ties. It's like a tornado under there, dirt debris flying everywhere, his clothes flapping wildly. The train passes. Camille looks up, afraid to breath as Joe lies motionless on the tracks. Suddenly he stirs, pushes himself up to his knees. She lets out a scream of joy, races toward him, as he gets to his feet, stumbles off the grade. She hugs him to her, tears streaming down her face, helps him over to the embankment.</context>

We HEAR THE SNAP of bone and tendon, as Alvin plummets to the ground, writhing in pain, grabbing his left leg.</context>

      <utterance>5:51 to go. Georgia Tech up 10 to nothing. The Wolves are gonna have to find some offense in a hurry here. Their defense has been keepin' them in it.</utterance>

      <utterance>Joe, I know that Rehab was good for you. Got rid of a lotta bad habits. But what about the rest of you? What happened to the Joe Kane that used to take command of this team, the Joe Kane these guys i'd run through a bulldozer for? They put him out with the trash? What are you waitin' for, somebody to feel sorry for you cause you've had some problems? Nobody in this stadium gives a shit. It's time to step up, Joe. Time to sit at the head of the Table.</utterance>

   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Joe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage, yells "Go!" The ball is snapped, Joe drops back, hits Darnell on the sideline. First down. In quick succession, we see Joe: 1) Complete a 15 yarder to Ray over the middle. 2) Fades to pass, is rushed. Forced out of the pocket, scrambles for his life, manages to get down to the 4 yard line. He gets up, surveys the distance to pay dirt.</context>
      <utterance>All right, we've held these guys up long enough. Give me time back here, and I'll rip 'em apart. 16 shift, green, bolt. First sound.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARVEY</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nice bit of scrambling by Kane to get it to the four, but it's gonna bring up fourth and goal. No doubt about it, with 3:45 they've gotta go for it here, if they're gonna get back in this game.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Winters gives Ray a shove and he runs onto the field. Ray is upset, angry. He swears to himself.</context>
      <utterance>No, we're gonna go with the sweep.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The team breaks out, comes to the line. Joe looks over the defense, screams signals as the CROWD NOISE is building. We go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped. Ray takes one step forward then turns right, leading the play. Joe pitches to Darnell who follows Ray. Georgia Tech's outside linebacker comes up to stop the play. Ray stumbles before he can make the block. He drops out of our picture.</context>
      <utterance>28 Thunder right. On 2.</utterance>
   <speaker>DARNELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Darnell is forced to go wider toward the sideline. The linebacker and cornerback are closing, both have the angle on him. Darnell starts to cut back. He lowers his shoulder to take the linebacker's blow. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Ray reappears and throws a devastating block on the linebacker, knocking him back into the cornerback, taking them both out. Darnell cuts it up and blasts over the safety at the goal line. Touchdown, E.S.U. The stands erupt. It's the first thing they've had to cheer about all day. Winters just looks at the clock, goes over to talk to his defense. Darnell foregoes his touchdown dance. He runs over to Ray, grabs him by the helmet.</context>
      <utterance>Shit!</utterance>
   <speaker>DARNELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ray smiles. They butt heads and run off the field</context>
      <utterance>Monster block, man. Monster motherfuckin' block.</utterance>
