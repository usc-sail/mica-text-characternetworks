      <context>Dickie heads towards the cabin. Freddie takes over the tiller. There's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the water. From where Ripley sits he can see Capri in the distance, but he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering him a restricted view. He looks down and there's a flash of flesh, then nothing. Then as the boat swings with the waves, he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then Marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red-painted toes straining. Ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely betrayed. FREDDIE (cont'd) Tommy - How's the peeping? Come on Tommy, you were looking. Tommy Tommy Tommy. Shamed, Ripley looks away. He stares at the water, parting before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his.</context>

Ripley almost loses his balance. His glasses come off. They struggle, locked together in a life or death wrestle to get control of the oar. Dickie's blinded by his own blood, loses his grip. Ripley, terrified, hits Dickie again and again, the oar like a carpet-beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, blood on Ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath, letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he's let it rest in a pool of blood. He starts to sob, sprawls there, sobbing, next to Dickie, horrified by what he's done. Nobody's in sight. The boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling indifferently on the waves.

There's a side to him, when our heads are on the pillow, I know no-one else sees it, which is really tender. (unravelling) I think I should come with you to Rome and just confront him.

He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize. A SMALL RED STAIN is appearing on the pocket of his robe. As he speaks the stain spreads. He looks at it absently. RIPLEY (cont'd) Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him - well, you know that. Marge. I loved you - you might as well know - I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day.</context>

      <utterance>Okay.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACCARRON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half- killed a boy? Ripley turns, shocked.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACCARRON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MacCarron gets up.</context>
      <utterance>At a party. Over some girl. He kicked the kid several times in the head. Put him in the hospital. The boy had a wire fixed in his jaw. The Rome Police didn't think to ask Mr Greenleaf.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACCARRON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ripley's head drops.</context>
      <utterance>Nor did they think to check whether a Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at Princeton University. I turned up a Tom Ripley who'd been a piano tuner in the music department.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACCARRON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ripley doesn't know where this barrage is going.</context>
      <utterance>See - in America we're taught to check a fact before it becomes a fact. We're taught to nose around when a girl drowns herself, find out if that girl was pregnant, find out if Dickie had an embarrassment there.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.</utterance>

      <utterance>I hope she never knows.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACCARRON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He walks out of the room, returns carrying THE LICENSE PLATES from Freddie's car.</context>
      <utterance>Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACCARRON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed.</context>
      <utterance>Mr Greenleaf also feels there was a silent promise in Dickie's letter to you which he intends to honor. He intends to transfer a good part of Dickie's income from his trust into your name. He doesn't intend to give the Italian police any information about Dickie's past. He's rather hoping you'll feel the same.</utterance>
