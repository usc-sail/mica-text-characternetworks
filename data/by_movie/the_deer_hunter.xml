The OLDER WOMEN look half-frozen and as they move toward a table the cake receives a great chorus of Uhh's and Ahh's. Suddenly one of the OLDER WOMEN collapses. Friends rush to her aid, seat her in a chair and give her wine. The WOMAN takes the glass, tosses it off in one swallow and grins. EVERYONE laughs.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>LINDA reaches down, takes her FATHER by the shoulder and rolls him over. It takes some effort and the face that comes up is gray, unshaven and implacably bitter. Saliva dribbles from his mouth, there is a cut with the stitches still in it seaming his forehead and as LINDA looks at him he begins cursing again.</context>

   <speaker>FATHER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>LINDA gets up and closes the window. She comes back, gets down on the floor beside her father and pushes him toward the bed. Then, hiking up her bridesmaid's dress, she takes him by the shoulders again and heaves him onto the coverlet. The effort is almost too much for her. Tears begin to burn in her eyes, but when he slips back she tries again. The father groans, begins to mumble, and then, when she almost has him on the bed, he suddenly lifts his hand, catches her full in the face and pushes her violently across the room. LINDA crashes backwards over a fallen chair and smashes into the wall. As she gets to her feet her father advances on her.</context>

      <context>As the PRIEST continues with the Holy Sacrament CAMERA PICKS UP FACES IN THE CONGREGATION. We see SAL'S FAMILY. We see ANGELA'S FAMILY. We see the VETS from the V.F.W. Post. We see the STEELWORKERS from the bar and the WIVES and MOTHERS who chased them home to change. They are hard faces -- working class faces -- but we sense a fortitude among the congregation, a community of both heart and spirit. CAMERA PICKS UP NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN standing in a row opposite the BRIDESMAIDS. The guys all look slightly disheveled. Their tuxedos are all too small and their shoes are soaking wet from walking in the snow. NICK catches LINDA's eye and they hold each other across the intervening space like two children who are amazed. The PRIEST hands white tapers to the bride and groom. CAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON THE PRIEST. The man is impressive -- gentle yet full of power. The PRIEST lights the tapers -- first ANGELA's, then SAL's -- and looks out across the assembled congregation.</context>

      <context>ANGELA begins to tremble, jabs out her cigarette and stands up. She stares at NICK for a moment, goes to a telephone pad and writes down a number in a tiny, nearly illegible scrawl. NICK comes up behind her. ANGELA finishes, puts down the pen and stands with her back against the wall. NICK tears off the piece of paper, looks at it, puts it in his pocket.</context>

      <context>But NICK is out, gone. LINDA lets out a little moan and sits down on the chair beside the bed. Then, almost immediately, she stands and begins taking off his clothes. She takes off his shoes, then both socks. As she goes to undo his belt, his shirt, which is unbuttoned, falls slightly open, revealing a fresh scar. LINDA stares at the scar for a moment, then she slowly exposes the whole of NICK's chest.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>For a moment MERLE doesn't answer. His eyes are pale, like faded robin's eggs, and they seem to look through NICK, as if to some landscape far beyond.</context>
      <utterance>Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>MERLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A BEAUTIFUL VIETNAMESE GIRL steps up and whispers something in MERLE's ear.</context>
      <utterance>I like it because it's simple.</utterance>

      <context>NICK starts after them. He can see them ahead, moving rapidly through a GROUP OF ARVN OFFICERS and WHORES.</context>

      <utterance>I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find. Tears are streaming down NICK's face and he sits down, looking miserable.</utterance>
