      <context>Mr. Simpson suddenly looks far away. He gets a kind of dreamy look in his eye.</context>
      <utterance>The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.</utterance>

      <context>George swallows. The UNDERTONE in the room starts to grow as he glances toward the back of the room.</context>
      <utterance>I mean, of course you do, but it isn't just the cooking or the cleaning that you miss--it's something else, isn't it ...</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."</utterance>

      <utterance>Okay, that's IT!!!</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Slowly, almost imperceptibly George nods. A single tear rolls down his cheek. As it traces the side of his face it leaves a long trail of COLOR behind it.</context>
      <utterance>Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>He nods again and it all comes out. Betty smiles at him through her tears. Even Mr. Johnson smiles as well.</context>

      <utterance>C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...</utterance>

      <context>Big Bob looks at David and starts to tremble. It starts around the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of his head. After a moment or two, Big Bob has gone completely</context>

      <context>David smiles. Never been called cool before. They suddenly hear the SOUND of a motor and look to their left. A huge Greyhound bus lumbers up the highway, pulling to a halt at the sign. The doors open beckoning her in. Jennifer smiles at her brother, then turns toward the door ...</context>
