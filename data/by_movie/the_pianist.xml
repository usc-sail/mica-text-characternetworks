      <context>Meanwhile, a street band begins to play a waltz. Jewish policemen and German soldiers are clearing a space, shoving Jews out of the way, including Szpilman, Henryk and the nervous man. Other soldiers are clearing a space. Two GERMAN SOLDIERS pull out of the crowd a tall woman and a short man and haul them into the cleared space.</context>
      <utterance>A bridge, a schmidge, and the Germans claim to be intelligent. You know what I think? I think they're totally stupid. I've got a family to feed and I spend half my time here waiting for them to let us through.</utterance>

      <context>A Jewish policeman grabs Szpilman by his collar and pulls him back out of the police cordon. It's Heller. The rest of the family have reached the next truck to be filled. A scuffle as Szpilman tries to resist. Another Jewish policeman shoves him. Szpilman stumbles, falls to the ground, in front of him the closed ranks of the Jewish policemen's backs. He stands, runs at the cordon, seeing between their heads, shoulders, Mother, Regina, Henryk and Halina clambering into the trucks. Father is looking around, bewildered.</context>

At the furthest stall, he sees a woman, attractive, chic, in her thirties, buying vegetables at a stall. Her name is JANINA GODLEWSKA.

He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people.

He tenses. German voices shouting and their heavy footsteps on the stairs. He goes to the window, opens it. He gets a chair, places it sideways in front of the window to make a step. He's working out how best to throw himself out. He leans against the wall near the door and waits.. Slamming of doors, German shouts, a scream. Szpilman steels himself, ready to jump. Again footsteps on the stairs, but this time descending. A door slams. He cautiously goes to the window and looks out.</context>

      <context>Szpilman hesitates, then limps to the piano, puts down the tin, and opens the lid. He turns and drags one of the chairs over and sits. The German Captain stands and watches. Szpilman glances surreptitiously at his hands, and then he plays Chopin. The German Captain listens, expressionless. The pale moonlight shows him to be a handsome, elegant man. Szpilman finishes playing. Silence. Somewhere, a cat mews. Distant burst of rifle fire. The German Captain stares at Szpilman. After a moment:</context>

      <context>After a moment, the trapdoor shifts and Szpilman looks down. The German Captain takes a package from his shoulder bag and throws it up into the loft. He turns to go.</context>

On the opposite side of the street, he sees a man and a woman who have left the field kitchen. The man carries a two-tiered canister. Szpilman rushes towards them, grabs hold of the man and tries to kiss him. The man, totally bewildered, tries to fight him off. The woman is terrified.</context>
