      <context>They have reached the top of the hill. Stunning martial preparations are underway. The catapults join ten others. Archers are taking up position. Brutal "Scorpions" -- devices for firing multiple crossbow bolts -- are being loaded. Soldiers are also loading the catapults with enormous "Greek fire pots" -- large, round terra cotta pots. Maximus and his lieutenants gaze down from the hilltop. Below them they can see a German encampment.</context>

One night my father had him strangled for conspiring with the Senate. My father never spoke of it. I never spoke of it. That is what it is to be the daughter of Rome.</utterance>

      <context>She then pulls something from her robes and sets it down, a little bundle wrapped in cloth. She sweeps out. The sound of the door being bolted shut on the other side.

He looks at it deeply, gently feeling along the contours with a finger.</context>

      <context>He stabs Quintus with a dagger as he embraces him. Quintus falls. A beat. Titus goes to the dead Quintus and pulls the seal of office from his uniform. He hands it to Maximus. An enormous roar of celebration from the Felix Regiment.</context>
