   <speaker>ISHMAEL</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>...we look over the right shoulder of ISHMAEL CHAMBERS, early 30's, dark, a rugged, somber man jotting notes on a pad which rests on his right leg.</context>
      <utterance>It was the first murder trial on the island in thirty-one years.</utterance>
   <speaker>ISHMAEL</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>He glances blandly at his nonchalant colleagues.</context>
      <utterance>Our only newspaper was the San Piedro Review, a four-page weekly that I operated alone.</utterance>
   <speaker>ISHMAEL</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>To the JURY BOX. Truck farmers, grocers, fishermen, in sober neckties. A waitress, a secretary, fisher wives in Sunday dresses.</context>
      <utterance>What, I wondered, could the Seattle boys know of the hearts of these people...</utterance>
   <speaker>ISHMAEL</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>To the neighbor. The ramrod-still defendant.</context>
      <utterance>Neighbors, sitting in judgement. On their neighbor.</utterance>
   <speaker>ISHMAEL</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Ishmael writing on the pad balanced precariously on his knee, until...</context>
      <utterance>Kabuo Miaymoto sat with the rigid grace of a Samurai warrior. As if detached from his own trial.</utterance>
   <speaker>ISHMAEL</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>...it falls with a CLATTER of pages. He reaches with his right hand, replaces the pad on his thigh. Around him, CAMERAS are being swung to the ready. Ishmael looks to see... ...a slender WOMAN of refined beauty, entering the courtroom. A few flashes POP, and Ishmael's right hand retrieves a venerable box camera from beneath his seat, as his notepad falls once more, unheeded.</context>
      <utterance>Did he know how dangerous his demeanor could be? With this jury.</utterance>
   <speaker>ISHMAEL</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Ishmael pivots, and we understand his struggle with the notepad. For he is forced to rest his camera on the stump of his amputated left arm, its empty sleeve pinned at the elbow.</context>
      <utterance>Hatsue Miyamoto had been without her husband for 77 days.</utterance>
   <speaker>ISHMAEL</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Through his VIEWFINDER, we see HATSUE take her place in the first row. And sensing her presence, her husband turns. Their eyes meet. A string of FLASHES... But none from Ishmael. He hesitates. As if considering whether he will violate this woman's privacy. The camera lowers. HOLD on his face...</context>
      <utterance>He was in jail. When his baby son learned to walk.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I think you testified</utterance>
   <speaker>NELS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And yet you started the engine right up. With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge. Did that strike you odd?</utterance>
   <speaker>MORAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>So no, it didn't strike me odd.</context>
      <utterance>Didn't think about it at the time.</utterance>
   <speaker>NELS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Does it now?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A little. Yes. You have to wonder.</utterance>
   <speaker>NELS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And lets that sit. Scratches his neck.</context>
      <utterance>You have to wonder.</utterance>
   <speaker>NELS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Correct?</context>
      <utterance>You found three batteries, you say. A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor.</utterance>
   <speaker>MORAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It is.</utterance>
   <speaker>NELS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery. A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8. It would be too large for the deceased's well.</utterance>
   <speaker>MORAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting. You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.</utterance>
   <speaker>NELS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Right there. Why not use that?</context>
      <utterance>But he had a spare D-6, you said.</utterance>
   <speaker>MORAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ah.</context>
      <utterance>It was dead. We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.</utterance>
   <speaker>NELS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>No answer to that. The silence rests.</context>
      <utterance>Maybe he carried a spare that was too large to fit. So he'd have to bang out the flange to squeeze it in?</utterance>
   <speaker>NELS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on</utterance>
   <speaker>NELS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No spare.</utterance>

      <utterance>No.</utterance>

   <speaker>NELS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A beat.</context>
      <utterance>I'm curious. The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?</utterance>
   <speaker>MORAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I believe so.</utterance>
   <speaker>NELS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stops. Thinking.</context>
      <utterance>Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.</utterance>
   <speaker>NELS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?</utterance>

   <speaker>HATSUE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He didn't say no. That was Kabuo's point. Given how Carl's mother felt, Carl was</utterance>
   <speaker>HATSUE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>No. Kabuo did not wish to beg, he respected Carl's right to reflect. He was sure Carl would do the honorable thing. NELS  And did he?</utterance>
   <speaker>HATSUE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nels raises his eyebrows. To give the point its weight.</context>
      <utterance>The night of the 15th, Kabuo helped Carl at sea. With his dead battery.</utterance>
   <speaker>HATSUE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nels lets that sit. And sit.</context>
      <utterance>Right there, on the boat, they agreed. $8400 for the seven acres, $800 down. They shook on it. Kabuo was so excited when he came home.</utterance>
   <speaker>NELS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The slightest pause. As if hesitant to confess...</context>
      <utterance>And when did you first learn. That Carl had drowned?</utterance>
   <speaker>HATSUE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And Alvin Hooks rises. Perches on the edge of the prosecutor's table. And looks at the witness with fairness and suspicion.</context>
      <utterance>One o'clock, that afternoon, from a clerk at Petersen's. NELS  Your witness.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOOKS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>No impatience across her perfect features. Only earnestness will do.</context>

   <speaker>HATSUE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I said 'excited'. Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.</utterance>

   <speaker>HOOKS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news. Yes? HATSUE  No.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOOKS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hatsue shifts in her chair. Smooths her skirt.</context>
      <utterance>Really? Didn't call your mother, your sisters, about starting a new life. Your husband never tells his brothers that the family honor is vindicated.</utterance>
   <speaker>HATSUE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Only a few hours later.</context>

   <speaker>HATSUE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hooks pouts. He allows himself that.</context>
      <utterance>We are...cautious people. You would say conservative. There would be time for celebrating with others when a paper was signed.</utterance>

      <utterance>Why not?</utterance>
   <speaker>HATSUE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOOKS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Her eyes cut to Nels. He smiles, to blunt the harm she's done by looking to him for support. Her gaze goes down now. And then... ...back up. Straight to Hooks.</context>
