A thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight, unless it hits metal, then it'll bust up in little bitty pieces. They'll keep going but they'll be slowed down quite a bit. How's about a three-fifty-seven? It'll go through the seat, her, you, the dashboard, shit, it'll go through the engine block before it knows it's hit anything, end up in some pedestrian three blocks away. What do you think?
