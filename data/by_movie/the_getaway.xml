      <context>CAROL FIRES the automatic. The big gun belches the full slip in a stuttering EXPLOSION... the slide remains back and in an ejected position. BEYNON is driven back to the kitchen wall. He SHRIEKS aloud, the noise strangely like laughter... his body flattens against the surface, slips downward^ riddled by the big bore slugs... Doc stands momentarily frozen against the overturned table. He looks up from Beynon's crumpled body. Carol takes two steps forward, then drops the automatic, sending it clattering and spinning away across the floor. DOC looks at Carol, their eyes find each other. He turns, moves to the sink, splashes water across his face, then fills a glass of water from the tap ... drinks it; he looks back at her. CAROL stands watching Doc, tears scream down her cheeks. DOC crosses to Carol, takes her arm, picks up the gun, spent shells and the suitcase, then leads her out of the kitchen toward the back door. Beynon's body has slipped from sight, only a few traces of blood show along the white wall.</context>
