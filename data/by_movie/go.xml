      <utterance>You know what I like best about Christmas? The surprises. It's like, you get this box, and you're sure you know what's in it. You shake it, you weigh it, and you're totally convinced you have it pegged. No doubt in your mind. But then you open it up, and it's something completely different. Bing! Wow! Bang! Surprise! I mean, it's like you and me here. She smiles. She has a bewitching smile.</utterance>

Why would he drive up to Pinecliff by himself? And why would you still have his briefcase?  Answer me that, Danielle. If you have an answer. MUSIC rises, a scene cut.</utterance>
