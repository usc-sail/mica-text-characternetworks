Skittering along the undercarriage one moment, across the metal roof the next. Even appearing -- fleetingly, impossibly -- in the snow on the blocked driver's side window. All the electronics in the car start going crazy, power locks opening and closing, the interior light flickering, the dashboard clock hands spinning wildly, the windshield wipers sweeping back and forth, etc. Then stop all at once. Even the radio SNAPS OFF. Dead silence for a beat. Then an odd SCUTTLING SOUND underfoot, something crawling along the undercarriage of the car. Our guy sits there frozen with fear, too scared to move, to even breathe. Likewise, the girl sits nervously, watching her breath in the cold. Her eyes happen to wander to the rear view mirror- A blue-faced DEAD BABY stares back at her from the rear window ledge. She SWINGS around, looks back at the window. But nothing's there.</context>
