      <utterance>The King of Scotland had died without a son, and the king of England, a cruel pagan known as Edward the Longshanks, claimed the throne for himself. Scotlandâ€™s nobles fought him, and fought each other, over the crown. So Longshanks invited them to talks of truce. No weapons, one page only.</utterance>

   <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>

      <context>He turns to run, but knocks back into the feet of the hanged man behind him!

   <speaker>PRIEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>With the final Amen, the neighbors drift from the graveside, pulling their Children along, to give William a last moment of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies. The boy stands alone over the open graves, his heart so shattered that he can scarcely cry; a single tear makes its way down his face. And the tiny girl feels for William in a way that the adults cannot. From the ground she pulls a Scottish thistle, moves to the softly weeping William and places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand. William looks up and their young eyes meet; her sad blue eyes hold William's as the grave diggers cover the bodies. Then a lone, mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill above them. Tall, thin and angular, in black clerical garb, he looks like the grim reaper. The girl hurries back to her mother's side; everyone watches in silence as the figure rides down to them. He is ARGYLE WALLACE. He looks like a human buzzard, his face craggy, permanently furious.</context>

      <context>Argyle glowers at the man, dismounts, and glares at William. William stares up at this frightening figure. They are interrupted by the ominous sound of approaching horses; a dozen mounted English soldiers, armed with lances, are approaching. Argyle rattles to the priest...</context>

   <speaker>VOICE OVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>LONGSHANKS, King of England, stands in the jeweled light of the ancient Abbey. Known as Longshanks because of the spindly legs that make him almost seven feet tall, he has a hawk's nose and a snake's eyes, punctuating a face of distinct cruelty. Historians of his day considered him and the line of Plantagenets from which he came to be devil worshipers.</context>
      <utterance>Twelve years later, Longshanks supervised the wedding of his eldest son, also named Edward, who would succeed him to the throne.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE OVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>GENEVIEVE, a nineteen-year-old virgin of stupendous beauty moves down the aisle, the light in her face outshining her blindingly white wedding gown. As she reaches the altar her hands tremble, but she maintains her poise and control. She looks toward EDWARD, Prince of Wales. Pampered young men surround him as his retinue. He takes her hand coldly and goes through the ceremony under his father's stare.</context>
      <utterance>As bride for his son, Longshanks had chosen a relative of his rival, the king of France.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE OVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The ceremony concluding, attendants lift back the bride's veil. Her wedding day, the ultimate moment -- and Prince Edward ignores her, to turn back to his friends. But prompted by one of the sour lords, he leans over and pecks his new Princess on the cheek. For an instant, we see in her eyes that her heart is dying. But she keeps her poise.</context>
      <utterance>It was widely whispered that for the Princess to conceive, Longshanks would have to do the honors himself. That may have been what he had in mind all along.</utterance>

   <speaker>OLD ADVISOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Longshanks glares at him, but takes the point. The wheels grind in his brain; his dark eyes falling on the Princess, he is inspired.</context>
      <utterance>Sire... Our nobles will be reluctant to relocate. New lands mean new taxes, and they are taxed already for our war in France.</utterance>
   <speaker>LONGSHANKS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Perhaps it's time to reinstitute an old custom. Grant them prima noctes, "First night." When any common girl inhabiting their lands is married, our lords shall have sexual rights to her on the night of her wedding.

   <speaker>SOLDIER</speaker>

      <utterance>Hey boy! You hunt this bird? William's eyes fix themselves on the soldier.</utterance>
   <speaker>SOLDIER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His buddies, enjoying their role as intimidators, grab the bird and begin to search it for evidence.</context>
      <utterance>It's against the law for Scots to own bows. You shot this bird?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They don't believe that -- but they can't find any puncture wound on the bird. William reaches his hand out for the return of the bird. The soldiers drop it onto the ground. Slowly, William picks it up, and heads into the clearing. The farmers watch him come. Among those noticing William's arrival, but pretending not to, is MARION MacCLANNOUGH, grown now into a stunning young woman; her long auburn hair reminds us of those years long ago; she wears it the same way, straight and full down her back. Her dress is plain, like the grass that surrounds a wildflower. She's the most beautiful girl in the village, maybe in all of Scotland, and the soldiers who hassled William notice her too. William reaches the food table and contributes his goose to the feast. FARM WOMEN eye him; he nodes to one.</context>
      <utterance>I hit it in the head. With a rock.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Miz MacDougal. You look well.</utterance>
   <speaker>FARM WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The daughter mentioned is missing teeth. William nods to her. It's impossible for him to giver her a smile as bright as her hopes, and she lowers her head in disappointment. But then raises her face in surprise as William takes her hand and gives her a respectful bow. He moves away from the table, passing through the crowd like a stranger. Then he glances toward the knot of girls. He sees Marion. She sees him, then looks away. Do they remember each other? He moves toward her; she is shy, her eyes downcast, but then she raises them and looks at him. They move closer and closer together. Just as they are about to reach each other, a huge round stone THUMPS to the earth at Williams' feet. He looks up to see one of Marion's suitors -- the broad, muscled young man who has just tossed the stone in William's way. Now everybody's looking to see how William will handle the challenge. He tries to move around, but the guy cuts him off. Then William thinks he recognizes the big red-head.</context>
      <utterance>...William? It's William Wallace, back home! -- Have you met my daughter?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>It is his old friend, but Hamish won't admit it, or be put off from the challenge. He points to the huge stone.</context>

   <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He taps his temple. Hamish stretches out his hand, as if to show William something in his palm.</context>
      <utterance>The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAMISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>With a sudden movement, he slams his fist into William's jaw, dropping him. A few men move to interfere, but Campbell, MacClannough, and the other farmers who are the true leaders here, stop their neighbors from interrupting. Hamish stands over William, waiting for him to get up.</context>
      <utterance>No. It's here.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>William stands and hoists the huge stone, eighteen inches in diameter. Straining with the effort, he lugs the stone to the line scratched in the rocky field. Beyond the line are the muddy dents from previous tosses. William takes a run and heaves the stone. It flies past the other marks in the field; people are impressed. William looks at Hamish.</context>
      <utterance>A contest, then.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAMISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hamish walks out, lifts the stone, and lugs it back to the line. He takes a run and heaves with a great groan! The stone flies, passing William's mark by a couple of feet. People laugh and whistle. William nods, impressed.</context>
      <utterance>That depends on the man.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>I could crush you like a roach.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hamish scowls at William, at everybody watching. He lifts the stone and carries it back to the line. William stands calmly. Hamish backs up for his run. William yawns.</context>

   <speaker>HAMISH</speaker>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>William seems completely unafraid. He leans down, picks up a small smooth stone and tosses it up in the air casually. Stung by this show of calm, Hamish takes furious run, and heaves! The stone flies through the air, just misses William's head, and buries itself halfway into the earth behind him. William never flinches. The people cheer.</context>
      <utterance>He's tired, he should get a longer run.</utterance>

      <context>The musicians interrupt their playing; a group of heavily armed horsemen, with banners and flying colors, ride up, reining their horses into the middle of the celebration. In the middle of the group is an English NOBLEMAN; he is gray, in his fifties, and stops in front of the BRIDE and groom.</context>
      <utterance>He died in an accident, with my brother. Their cart turned over.</utterance>

      <utterance>I have come to claim the right of prima noctes. As the lord of these lands, I will bless this marriage by taking the bride into my bed on the first night of her union. Stewart, father of the BRIDE, lunges forward.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEWART</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The horsemen point their lances at the unarmed Scots -- who see that the English soldiers from the village have moved to the edge of the gathering, as if to dare any resistance.</context>

   <speaker>NOBLEMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Even unarmed, Stewart is about to attack -- but the bride intervenes. She grabs her father and whispers to him. She moves to her husband and does the same. Holding back tears, she allows herself to be pulled up behind one of the horsemen. Marion MacClannough is looking on, sobered by her friend's courage and sickened by her fate -- and Marion is even more unsettled as she notices that one of the soldiers, a particularly nasty looking brute with a scarred face, is leering at her. William Wallace sees this too. The noble and his escorts ride away, and as they do it begins to rain. The celebration destroyed, the Scots gather the food and disperse to their homes. But Wallace remains, standing in the downpour, keeping his thoughts to himself.</context>

      <context>The shout rings through the village; Marion hears it, and when she sees more soldiers at the far end of the lane she's trying to take out of town, she urges the horse into an even narrower back alley. She sees a clear route to freedom... But the flock of pigeons pecking on the scraps thrown there behind the shops rise into the horse's face with a sudden thrashing of wings, and the horse shies against a wall. Marion controls him, but a flap of her ripped dress has caught on a crude nail, and as the frightened horse lunges forward again, she is pulled off its bare back, her dress catching and ripping at the same time, dropping her hard.</context>

      <context>Wallace lifts his eyes, taking it all in. At the rear of the hall is a balcony, backed by a magnificent sunlit stained glass window, and in the center of its rainbow corona he sees a familiar form: Marion, so real to him in this moment of triumph that he can see her, glowing like an angel, in a gown worthy of the occasion. But the illusion won't last; in the blink of an eye she is gone, and Wallace hears the chant, and fingers the cloth she gave him.</context>

      <context>The nobles rise; court attendants hurry to Wallace and drape a golden chain of office around his neck.

      <context>Servants pull back the sides of the tent door, and a tall, slender, shapely female figure appears there. There in the shadows, she looks just like Marion! William is not the only one who notices the resemblance; he glances at Hamish and Campbell and sees them haunted by it too. Is this another dream? He pales, as she steps into the morning sun. She moves toward him, her face lowered. It is Marion! She reaches him, lifts her face... and he sees the Princess! William is relieved -- and yet as he sees the Princess more closely he is still shaken by the resemblance in the way she carries herself, her shape, the fall of her hair. The Princess is struck with Wallace, too -- tall, powerful, and commanding. Wallace dismounts, and moves to face her. Their eyes hang on each other. She sees something that she has not seen in the face of a man in her whole life. She surprises him by bending at the knee, in a half-submissive yet proud curtsey.</context>

Watching the gorgeous walk, Stephen lies back on his saddle and twitches his leg like a horny dog. Hamish backhands him; Campbell, Hamish and Stephen quickly dismount and follow the procession, shouldering their way in beside the Princess's French guards, so they can watch Wallace's back. The rest of the Scots surround the tent, ready for ambush. Nicolette is among the royal attendants there; seeing Wallace, she shoots a glance at the Princess that says Ooo-La-La! The servants have brought a throne for the Princess, a lower chair for Wallace. She sits; he refuses the chair. She studies him, taking in his anger and his pride.</context>

      <context>Stephen signals, and up the slope behind them come handlers with ten war dogs. Huge mastiffs, they wear steel collars, with razor sharp protrusions. Their handlers hold them at the end of long catch poles. The crossbowmen are distracted from their reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs; now, as the Scottish handlers run toward the English ranks and unleash the dogs, fear races through the English line. The dogs tear into them. It is chaos; the bowmen can't flee, and as the dogs mix among them, the bowmen fire frantically, mostly hitting each other. The dogs' collars slash legs; their jaws crush bones; even when their back legs are hacked off, the frenzied dogs keep killing. Wallace signals to Mornay with the Scottish cavalry. Mornay does nothing. The crossbowmen, though taking great punishment, are beginning to overwhelm the dogs by sheer numbers, and are regrouping.</context>

The Scottish spearmen, bunched in a tight group, are helpless. The bolts fall, cutting through their helmets and breastplates like paper. Wallace has no cavalry -- and his men are being slaughtered! He spurs his horse, and Stephen and the infantrymen race behind him. The English heavy cavalry surge to meet them, but Wallace weaves through them, dodging with his horse, slashing with the broadsword, cutting down on knight, another, another... The Scottish infantry claws in, dragging down the horses, hacking the knights as they run by. The English bowmen are about to fire again, but they see the Scottish charge bearing down on them and adjust their aim; the bolts cut into the infantrymen; one bolt tears off the armor of Wallace's left shoulder. He wobbles on his horse, regains his balance, and keeps up the charge.</context>

   <speaker>WALLACE</speaker>

      <context>The Scots pull up spears and hastily form another schiltron. The spears bristle out, ready... the English horsemen thunder in. But before the spears impale the horses, another flight of crossbow bolts cuts down half the Scots still fighting. Hamish reaches the rear of the battle and lowers the limp body of his father to the Scottish monks who are attending to the wounded and giving absolution to the dying... Still Wallace fights back, meeting the English charge. The Scots hold their own. An English knight tries to ride over William; he knocks the lance aside, and tough the horse slams into him, William also unseats the rider. The rider rolls to his feet. William struggles up to meet him -- and comes face to face with Robert the Bruce. The shock and recognition stun Wallace; in that moment, looking at Robert the Bruce's guilt-ridden face, he understands everything: the betrayal, the hopelessness of Scotland. As he stands there frozen, a bolt punches into the muscle of his neck, and Wallace doesn't react to it. Bruce is horrified at the sight of Wallace this way. He batters at Wallace's sword, as if its use would give him absolution.</context>
