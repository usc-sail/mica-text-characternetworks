      <utterance>- and today it is right that we should ask ourselves the one most important question: What is the purpose of these years, the purpose for all this demanding work, the purpose for the sacrifices made those who love us? Were there NOT a purpose, then all of these past years of struggle, of fierce competition and of uncom- promising ambition would be mean- ingless. But, of course, there is a purpose and I must tell it to you. I ask you to remember this purpose always and I pledge that I shall endeavor to carry it with me forever.</utterance>

   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>SOUND of her HANGING UP. Ben hangs up slowly. He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and carrying it folded across his arm in front of him, leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that lead to the main lobby. As he is about to go in, the doors open and a group of VERY OLD PEOPLE start coming out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering to each other and helping each other out of the door and down the steps. Ben holds one of the doors open for them and stands politely to one side. As they get through, Ben starts to move inside. At that moment, A DOZEN YOUNG PEOPLE, dressed as though for a high school dance, push him to one side and move past him into the lobby. He moves back against the other door, holding it open and allowing them to go in first. He smiles politely and they pay no attention to him at all. He follows them into the lobby. They move toward the front desk and he moves with them. One of the boys at the front of the group leans in and says something to the CLERK behind the desk. The clerk points across the lobby and says something to him. There are the SOUNDS of an orchestra PLAYING some- where. The group of young people passes by the desk and Ben moves in behind them. He pauses at the desk and looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the keys dangling suggestively.</context>

      <utterance>What? Oh - no - I'm just -</utterance>

      <context>Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes. He looks helplessly at the clerk.</context>

What he sees: People dancing, talking, sitting, etc. He turns back toward te lobby. He stops. What he sees: The room clerk scross the lobby watching him. Ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom as though to express his joy at finding the Singleman affair inside, then turns back and enters the ballroom.</context>

But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in him- self and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.</utterance>

      <utterance>We've talked enough, Benjamin.</utterance>

      <utterance>Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not exactly.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But you don't hate him.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>

      <utterance>No, Benjamin. I don't hate him.</utterance>

      <utterance>I don't.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>

      <utterance>Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is it?</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She nods and takes off her blouse.</context>
      <utterance>I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.</utterance>

      <utterance>No.</utterance>

   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I never did, Benjamin. Now let's -</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She nods.</context>
      <utterance>Well, wait a minute. You married him.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why did you do that?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>

   <speaker>BEN</speaker>

   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I can't see why you did, unless ...you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Don't tell Elaine.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>All right. Now let's get to bed.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>So how did it happen?</context>
      <utterance>Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What?</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not particularly.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She nods.</context>
      <utterance>Was he a law student at the time?</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And you were a student also.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>At college.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>

      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What was your major?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why are you asking me all this?</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Art.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>

      <context>She nods.</context>
      <utterance>Art?</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But I thought you - I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Kind of.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well how did it happen?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How do you think.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm curious.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We'd go to his car.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh no. In the car you did it?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ben thinks for a moment.</context>

   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What kind of car was it?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>

      <utterance>What?</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do you remember the make of the car?</utterance>

      <utterance>Oh my God.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Really. I want to know.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It was a Ford, Benjamin.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's enough.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There is a pause.</context>
      <utterance>So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't talk about Elaine.</utterance>

   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She walks to the bed.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>There's nothing to tell.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well - I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --</utterance>

      <context>Ben looks at her.</context>

   <speaker>BEN</speaker>

      <utterance>Good.</utterance>

      <utterance>No.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>

      <context>She pulls the covers down.</context>
      <utterance>Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?</utterance>

      <utterance>We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to -</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Benjamin?</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?</utterance>

      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>

      <utterance>You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?</utterance>

   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She nods.</context>

   <speaker>BEN</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Because - Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. ROBINSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.</utterance>
