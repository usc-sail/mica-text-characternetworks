      <utterance>She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872. One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.</utterance>

She steps still closer, training her light on the form to see that it is a human torso. A large gash runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by scavenging birds. She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with wide, unseeing eyes. It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines her light back to the headless torso. She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her. She spins around to see another body above her. Except this one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum to mouth. One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below it. A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another bent pipe.</context>

      <context></context>

      <context>A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look. When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising up from the bottom. She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles. As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear that the water is not water at all but blood. And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up. Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams. Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.</context>

      <context>Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far apart.

      <context>Everything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there. The blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking on in disbelief.</context>

He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe the rest of the way. Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a basket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls, a little out of reach. She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles her. Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it. She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting with Greer's head. He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger marks. She fumbles her radio up.</context>
