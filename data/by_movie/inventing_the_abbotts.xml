      <context>Jacey swats Doug's school books out from under his arm -- Doug charges his brother to retaliate but they are rudely interrupted by a CAR HORN. They scurry out of the way as LLOYD ABBOTT pulls his 1957 Cadillac out of the driveway and cruises down the street. Lloyd is a well-dressed- and-fed man in his mid-forties. A Midwestern burgher, he exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent pillars of this community. Doug is embarrassed by Lloyd's passing, but Jacey evidently experiences a deeper humiliation -- he gives Doug a glance of betrayal, turns and walks down the block.</context>

      <utterance>Because my parents want her to and Alice is afraid of my parents. It's practically an arranged marriage.

      <context>Doug exhales with bewilderment, stubs out his cigarette, then awkwardly slides down the sofa to Pamela. She holds perfectly still as Doug slowly moves his mouth to hers and kisses her. Then he concludes the kiss to check her reaction; she timidly smiles. He kisses her again with greater fervor. Doug creeps his hand up her blouse and massages her breast. Pamela struggles to suppress her surprise, which he mistakes as a sign of her approval. Emboldened by her lack of resistance, he slips his hand under her bra. Pam is shocked by the pleasure of the sensation, then alarmed by the pace of their passion.</context>

      <context>Doug allows Pam to pull him out onto the dance floor. He feels like a dolt, but she arranges his hands on her and they begin to dance. She gazes into his eyes and smiles:</context>

      <context>Pam is in love with Doug, she has been since they were children. Doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for her. For a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble of true affinity. But their bubble begins to deflate as Doug sees Joan Abbott staring at them. Her disapproval is unmistakable. Doug steers Pam around the dance floor to avoid Joan's eyes, but then he sees Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd's stare is even more discomforting. Pamela senses the change in Doug's mood, but she is unaware of the cause.</context>

      <utterance>Jacey was almost two and I was eight months pregnant with you and... well, some mornings I'd be crying before I even woke up. Then you were born. And Jacey just got lost in there.

      <utterance>After Charlie died Lloyd Abbott started dropping by on his way home from work. He felt so bad about that bet Charlie made with him at the lake. That foolish, idiotic bet. Poor Lloyd -- I felt sorry for him. He'd have a cup of coffee with Mother and me. If a doorknob had come off he'd fix it. He'd carry the garbage cans to the curb. Someone dies, people try to be helpful. But he was by here so often that people started to talk. It was fairly obvious that he wanted something more from me than just a cup of coffee. I suggested that he didn't need to stop by here so often, but... then one afternoon I was at Woolworth's, having lunch at the counter. All of sudden Joan Abbott was standing there -- screaming and yelling at me to stop sleeping with her husband, with Lloyd. I was speechless. She was gone before I could find my tongue.</utterance>

He used to call me 'Egg-head' -- hell, everybody did. And back then everybody knew that Egg-head Abbott didn't stand a snowball's chance in hell with Helen Riley. Of course, that was all before I became Lloyd Abbott -- Mr. Abbott. That was back when I still had chicken shit on my shoes and twelve cents in my pocket. Charlie Holt was the only one good enough for Helen. I used to spy on 'em -- yup, I did.  Used to watch them sit on the front porch of her house -- your house -- and watch 'em talk.</utterance>
