      <mode></mode>
      <context>He folds his paper, rises, and walks by the presses into Madison's office. Interior: Madison's Office, Day Madison, the city editor, is correcting copy at his desk.</context>
      <utterance>Burden! Jack Burden! The boss wants to see you.</utterance>
   <speaker>MADISON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, Jack, ever hear of a fellow called Willie Stark?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No. Who'd he shoot?</utterance>
   <speaker>MADISON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, county... uh... treasurer, or something like that.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's so special about him?</utterance>
   <speaker>MADISON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They say he's an honest man. What I want you to do is to hop into your car...</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why, you promised me a vacation.</utterance>
   <speaker>MADISON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, that can wait.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He opens his newspaper to the society page and shows Madison a photograph of Anne Stanton.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah... but there's a... a girl I know.</utterance>
   <speaker>MADISON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jack takes the paper back and looks at it.</context>
      <utterance>Oh... Well, she can wait too.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The question is... can I?</utterance>
   <speaker>MADISON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The answer is... get up there.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Right.  Oh... uh... what did you say his name was?</utterance>
   <speaker>MADISON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Who?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The fellow's name.</utterance>
   <speaker>MADISON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Madison goes on with his work.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, the... uh... Stark... Willie Stark.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Willie Stark...</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A man in shirt sleeves and suspenders, Tiny Duffy, comes out of the local poolroom, listens for a moment to Willie's speech, and signals to two uniformed men to go over and break up the gathering. Jack Burden stands close to the platform, next to Willie's son, Tom, who waits patiently to distribute handbills.</context>
      <utterance>...to lie to them in order to line their own dirty pockets with the taxpayers' money. When have the citizens of Kanoma County ever witnessed a campaign like this? Why is the opposition so anxious to defeat me? Why have they used every dirty method known to make sure I'm not elected county treasurer? Well, I'll tell you why...</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The sheriff and his deputy push through the crowd.</context>
      <utterance>...Because they're afraid of the truth... and the truth is this. They're trying to steal your money. Yeah, I said steal. The county commissioners rejected the bid on the schoolhouse. Why? Well, they'll tell you their reason is the job will be done better. The county commissioners would have you believe that they're interested in public welfare. They're interested in welfare, sure. But it's their own. Let's look at the reason in the light of the facts and the figures. That brick factory is owned by one of the commissioners. That same brick factory uses convict labor.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sorry, Willie, you'll have to move on.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>City Ordinance Number One-Oh-Five: more than five people congregating is disturbing the peace.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If you folks'll be so kind as to read these handbills, my boy will pass them out among you.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>There's an ordinance against that too.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The sheriff pushes Tom back, grabbing the handbills out of his hand. Willie jumps down off the platform.</context>
      <utterance>Pass 'em out, Tom.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The sheriff collars Willie, then notices Jack on the platform snapping a picture.</context>
      <utterance>Let him alone!</utterance>

      <utterance>Where can I find Tiny Duffy?</utterance>
   <speaker>PILLSBURY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He walks over to Duffy. Some townspeople, who followed him there, gather around him to listen.</context>
      <utterance>Right over there, mister.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Uh, they told me I could get my camera back here.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Who told you that?</utterance>

      <utterance>People. Can I?</utterance>
   <speaker>DUFFY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You the reporter that's been snoopin' around town?</utterance>

   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's true... Only my boss on the paper can't see it that way.</utterance>
   <speaker>DUFFY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It ain't any of his business either.</utterance>

   <speaker>DUFFY</speaker>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, Tiny, you're a card... Ain't he a card? Yeah, he's a card... Now, who thought up those city ordinances about arresting someone for making a speech?</utterance>
   <speaker>DUFFY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Willie enters, accompanied by the sheriff and his deputy. The others in the room, including Sugar Boy in his bartender's apron, step aside to let him pass through.</context>
      <utterance>Who's arrested? Nobody's been arrested.  Hi, Willie.</utterance>
   <speaker>PILLSBURY</speaker>

      <utterance>Yeah, I gave 'em back.</utterance>
   <speaker>DUFFY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Give him back his flag and his bag and...  give this man his camera.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm going to be on that same street corner tomorrow, Mr. Duffy.</utterance>
   <speaker>DUFFY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You go right ahead, Willie. We all believe in free speech. We got to... it's in the Constitution.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>My boy is out distributing those handbills now.</utterance>

      <utterance>Burden's my name... Jack Burden. Can we go somewhere where we can talk?</utterance>
   <speaker>DUFFY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jack examines the camera that has just been returned to him.</context>
      <utterance>Now that ain't polite. Don't you want to hear both sides of the story?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know your side.  What happened to the plate your men took from my camera?</utterance>
   <speaker>DUFFY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Must have dropped out. Oh, come on, fellas, let's relax. It's a hot day... Hey, Sugar Boy...</utterance>
   <speaker>SUGAR BOY</speaker>

   <speaker>PILLSBURY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now you know Willie don't drink, Tiny. His wife don't favor drinking. And Willie's the teacher's pet, ain't you, Willie?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Duffy roars with laughter.</context>
      <utterance>I'll have some orange pop if you don't mind.</utterance>
   <speaker>DUFFY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Orange pop! All right, Sugar Boy. Bring him some orange pop.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now ain't he a card?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They turn and go out.</context>
      <utterance>He stutters, Mr. Duffy, but you... you don't say anything.  Let's go, mister.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This is my wife, Lucy, Mr. Burden.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK AND LUCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How do you do?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jack reaches out to shake his hand.</context>
      <utterance>That's my pa.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Camera pulls back to include Jack, Lucy, and Pa, all seated around the dinner table.</context>
      <utterance>Now we'll talk.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You've been talking for a long time, Mr. Stark.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAPPY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Willie's got a lot to say.</utterance>
   <speaker>LUCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You sleepy, Pappy? You want to have a nap?</utterance>
   <speaker>PAPPY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lucy gets up and turns on a light in the kitchen.</context>
      <utterance>No, I want to hear it.</utterance>
   <speaker>LUCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm worried about Tom. It's getting dark. He should have been home.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's a strong boy. Don't worry about him. He can take care of himself.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How old is the boy?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Fifteen.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How long have you been married?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Willie grins at Jack's look of surprise. Lucy comes back into the room.</context>
      <utterance>Nine years.</utterance>
   <speaker>LUCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He was a neighbor's boy. They were poor folks. Both died. I couldn't have any children, so... He's a good boy.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, he's the best. I couldn't love him any more if he was my own flesh and blood.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And now you, Mrs. Stark?</utterance>
   <speaker>LUCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, there isn't very much to tell about me.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How did you meet?</utterance>
   <speaker>LUCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I was teaching school and one day a pupil walked in. It was Willie. I couldn't have a grown man in the class and Willie wanted to learn so badly... so I married him.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is that the only reason?</utterance>
   <speaker>LUCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Except that I loved him.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She goes back into the kitchen.</context>
      <utterance>Get the coffee, Lucy.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>When did they fire you, Mrs. Stark?</utterance>
   <speaker>LUCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A couple of weeks ago. I'd been teaching for a long time and nobody ever said I wasn't all right. But I don't care. I don't want to teach in a schoolhouse that they built just so somebody can steal some money. And Willie doesn't want to be Treasurer, either, if he has to associate with those dishonest people.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm going to run. They can't keep me from running.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If you don't mind the truth, Mr. Stark, you haven't much of a chance.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm going to run. They're not going to kick me around like I was dirt.</utterance>
   <speaker>LUCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Willie is silent. Jack looks at him.</context>
      <utterance>I don't care if Willie loses... just so he gets the truth to the people. Isn't that true, Willie?</utterance>
   <speaker>LUCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Isn't it, Willie?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hmmm?... Yeah, yeah, sure, that's right.</utterance>
   <speaker>LUCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, if you lose you can give a little more time to studying your law books.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, you studying law too?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>By myself, at night.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAPPY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Willie's a smart boy.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The door opens slowly and Tom comes in from the porch. His clothes are torn and his face is dirty and bloody. He still carries some of the handbills. They rise to their feet and cluster around him.</context>
      <utterance>If I ever find the time I'm going to take a course at the university.</utterance>
   <speaker>LUCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What happened, Tommy boy? What's the matter?</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I gave out the handbills, Pa.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Speak up. Speak up.</utterance>
   <speaker>LUCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Let him tell it his own way. Go on, Tommy.</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This time they were waiting for me. They took them away from me. Threw them in the dirt and beat me up. I brought some of them back.</utterance>

      <context>He throws his speech away. Duffy looks alarmed.</context>
      <utterance>I have a speech here. It's a speech about what this state needs. There's no need in my telling you what this state needs. You are the state and you know what you need... You over there... look at your pants. Have they got holes in the knees? Listen to your stomach. Did you ever hear it rumble from hunger?... And you, what about your crops? Did they ever rot in the field because the road was so bad you couldn't get them to market?... And you. What about your kids? Are they growing up ignorant as dirt, ignorant as you, 'cause there's no school for them?... No, I'm not going to read you any speech.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>

      <utterance>Shut up!</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sugar Boy listens intently, sharing in the anger in Willie's speech.</context>
      <utterance>Get ready to bust your sides laughing, 'cause it's sure a funny story. It's about a hick... a hick like you, if you please. Yeah, like you. He grew up on the dirt roads and gully washes of a farm. He knew what it was to get up before dawn and get feed and slop and milk before breakfast... and then set out before sunup and walk six miles to a one-room, slab- sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick knew what it was to be a hick, all right. He figured if he was going to get anything done, he had to do it himself. So he sat up nights and studied books. He studied law because he thought he might be able to change things some... for himself, and for folks like him.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jack, electrified, grips Sadie's arm.</context>
      <utterance>No, I'm not going to lie to you. He didn't start off thinking about the hicks and all the wonderful things he was going to do for them. No. No, he started off thinking of number one. But something came to him on the way. How he could do nothing for himself without the help of the people. That's what came to him. And it also came to him, with the powerful force of God's own lightning, back in his home country, when a schoolhouse collapsed because it was built of politics... rotten brick. It killed and mangled a dozen kids. But you know that story. The people were his friends because he fought that rotten brick. And some of the politicians down in the city, they knew that... So they rode up to his house in a big, fine, shiny car and said as how they wanted him to run for governor...</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Duffy fidgets as Willie continues to pace and speak, his face filled with conviction, and with fury.</context>
      <utterance>Sadie, he's wonderful... wonderful...</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He points his finger at Duffy, who is coming over to speak to him.</context>
      <utterance>...So they told the hick... and he swallowed it. He looked in his heart and he thought in all humility how he'd like to try and change things. He was just a country boy who thought that even the plainest, poorest man can be governor if his fellow citizens find he's got the stuff for the job. Well, those fellows in the striped pants... they saw the hick and they took him in.</utterance>
   <speaker>DUFFY</speaker>

Not as a charity, but as a right. And it is your right that every child shall have a complete education. That any man who produces anything can take it to market without paying toll. And no poor man's land or farm can be taxed or taken away from him. And it is the right of the people that they will not be deprived of hope...</utterance>

   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Because you're the best man for the job.</utterance>
   <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It could have nothing to do with my name being Stanton?</utterance>

      <utterance>It could have. Let's grant that.</utterance>
   <speaker>STANTON</speaker>

      <utterance>That's your answer.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, it's not. If that were the only answer I wouldn't be with him any more. There's another side of it. I've learned something from him. You can't make an omelet without cracking eggs.</utterance>

      <utterance>At what price?</utterance>

   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I really believe that Stark wants to do good. You do too. It's a matter of method. Many times out of evil comes good. Well, pain is an evil. As a doctor you should know that.</utterance>
   <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Pain is an evil; it is not evil. It is not evil in itself. Stark is evil.</utterance>

      <utterance>The people of the state don't think so.</utterance>
   <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How would they know? The first thing he did was to take over the newspapers and the radio stations. Why be so afraid of criticism? If Stark is interested in doing good, he should also be interested in the truth. I don't see how you can separate the two. No, Stark is not for me.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, Stark is not for you. Well, what is for you? Pride. Pride, that's all it is... foolish, stupid pride. All you've ever talked about is what you could do if... if somebody would tear down and build. All right, all right, somebody has, and he's given it to you. But he's not for you. No, he's not for you. She throws down her glass and runs crying from the room. Adam goes after her.</utterance>

      <utterance>The chips were down, and Willie knew it. He was fighting for his life. He roared across the state making one speech after another. And all of them added up to the same thing... "It's not me they're after, it's you!" Close-ups of Willie, speaking to the people.</utterance>

      <utterance>Willie hollered foul. Willie knew if you hollered long enough, hard enough, and loud enough, people begin to believe you. Just in case they didn't, he organized spontaneous demonstrations. Sign on back of a car: FIGHT WITH WILLIE Crowds carrying signs: WIN WITH WILLIE Willie talking on the telephone.

      <utterance>I made a mistake once, Jack... when I resigned. It was too easy then, just resigning, pulling out. No, Jack, I've made my choice. I have nothing more to lose.</utterance>

      <utterance>That's what I figured. Let's get down to cases, Judge. Do you remember a man with the name of Littlepaugh?</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Of course. I was their counsel for over ten years.</utterance>

      <utterance>You know, Judge, dirt's a funny thing. Some of it rubs off on everybody. How did you get the job, Judge? Blackmail?</utterance>
   <speaker>JUDGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I swear I never even remembered his name. Isn't that remarkable, Jack? I never even remembered his name. It's all so long ago it's hard for me to realize it ever happened.</utterance>

   <speaker>JUDGE</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, I do. Jack Burden. Willie Stark's hatchet man.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I asked you... how did you find out?</utterance>
   <speaker>JUDGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This would never stand at law, not for a minute. It happened over twenty- five years ago, and you could never get any testimony. Everybody is dead.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Everybody except you, Judge. You're alive. And people think you're a certain kind of man. And you just couldn't bear for people to think otherwise.</utterance>
   <speaker>JUDGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ever since then I... I've done my duty. I... I'm responsible for many good things.  But I also did this.</utterance>

      <utterance>Attention, please. Attention, please. The balloting on the impeachment proceedings against Governor Stark has just ended. This is the result: Willie Stark has won.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Loud applause, and cries of "yes."</context>
      <utterance>They tried to ruin me. But they are ruined. They tried to ruin me because they did not like what I have done. Do you like what I have done?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Having finished, he waves at them all. Then he notices Jack and comes down the steps to greet him.</context>
      <utterance>Remember, it's not I who have won, but you. Your will is my strength, and your need is my justice, and I shall live in your right and your will. And if any man tries to stop me from fulfilling that right and that will, I'll break him. I'll break him with my bare hands. For I have the strength of many.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He walks back up the steps, his arm around Jack's shoulders. They start to go into the building that way when Willie sees someone. He smiles and puts out his hand.</context>
      <utterance>Hello, Jack boy, I'm glad you're here. I knew you'd come back.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Adam is seen, waiting at the entrance of the building. Before Willie has taken a step Adam fires several shots into him. Willie falls to the ground and Sugar Boy whips out his pistol and fires at Adam. Three policemen with tommy guns open fire, shooting into Adam's already fallen body. Then they turn and point their guns at the mob of people rushing toward Willie, forcing them back.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, doctor, I'm very glad to see you.</utterance>
   <speaker>COP</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sugar Boy kneels beside Willie. Sadie stands against a pillar, looking down on him.</context>
      <utterance>Stand back, everybody. Stand back.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She doesn't answer, only walks away. He runs after her and catches hold of her arm.</context>
      <utterance>Anne, Anne... Where are you going?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't know. Leave me alone.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>To do what?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't care.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, that's too easy.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I do.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Leave me alone, please.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, no more.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's dead.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We're alive.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>My brother's dead.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We've got to go on living.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He turns her around so that she can see the crowds still struggling to get a look at Willie.</context>
      <utterance>So that Adam's death has meaning, so that it wasn't wasted. Anne, our life has to give his death meaning. Don't you see that? Look at those people...</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A policeman approaches.</context>
      <utterance>Look at them! They still believe in him. And we've got to make them see Willie the way Adam saw him, or there's no meaning in anything... anything.</utterance>
   <speaker>POLICEMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mr. Burden... the governor's asking for you. You better hurry. He's going fast.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>No reply.</context>
      <utterance>Will you wait here?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She nods her head slowly. Jack walks through the building to the pillar against which Willie has been propped. Sugar Boy is still beside him. He stands behind Sadie and Duffy, looking down at Willie.</context>
      <utterance>Will you wait here?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His head droops to the side and he dies.</context>
      <utterance>It could have been the whole world, Willie Stark. The whole world... Willie Stark. Why did he do it to me... Willie Stark? Why?</utterance>
