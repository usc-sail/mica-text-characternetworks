      <utterance>I live in the West Sixties - just half a block from Central Park. My rent is $84 a month. It used to be eighty until last July when Mrs. Lieberman, the landlady, put in a second-hand air conditioning unit.</utterance>

   <speaker>BUD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He carries his load into the kitchen. The kitchen is minute and cluttered. On the drainboard are an empty vermouth bottle, some ice-cube trays, a jar with one olive in it, and a crumpled potato-chip bag. Bud comes in, dumps his load on the drainboard, opens the old-fashioned refrigerator. He takes out a frozen chicken dinner, turns the oven on, lights it with a match, rips the protective paper off the aluminum tray and shoves it in. Now he starts to clean up the mess on the drainboard. He rinses the cocktail glasses, is about to empty the martini pitcher into the sink, thinks better of it. He pours the contents into a glass, plops the lone olive out of the jar, scoops up the last handful of potato chips, toasts an imaginary companion, and drinks up. Then he pulls a wastebasket from under the sink. It is brimful of liquor bottles, and Bud adds the empty vodka and vermouth bottles and the olive jar. Picking up the heavy receptacle, he carries it through the living room toward the hall door.</context>

   <speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bud, still eating, automatically reaches for the station- selector, pushes the button. A new channel pops on. It features a Western -- Cockamamie Indians are attacking a stagecoach. That's not for Bud. He switches to another station. In a frontier saloon, Gower Street cowboys are dismantling the furniture and each other. Bud wearily changes channels. But he can't get away from Westerns -- on this station, the U.S. Cavalry is riding to the rescue. Will they get there in time? Bud doesn't wait to find out. He switches channels again, and is back where he started. On the screen, once more, is the announcer standing in front of the crisscrossing searchlights.</context>
      <utterance>But first, a word from our sponsor. If you smoke the modern way, don't be fooled by phony filter claims --</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNOUNCER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>That does it. Bud turns the set off in disgust. The TV screen blacks out, except for a small pinpoint of light in the center, which gradually fades away. In the bathroom, Bud, in pajamas by now, is brushing his teeth. From the shower rod hang three pairs of socks on stretchers. Bud takes a vial from the medicine shelf, shakes out a sleeping pill, washes it down with a glass of water. He turns the light off, walks into the bedroom. In the bedroom, the single bed is made, and the lamp on the night table is on. Bud plugs in the electric blanket, turns the dial on. Then he climbs into bed, props up the pillow behind him. From the night table, he picks up the magazine that arrived in the mail, slides it out of the wrapper, opens it. It's the new issue of PLAYBOY. Bud leafs through it till he comes to the piece de resistance of the magazine. He unfolds the overleaf, glances at it casually, refolds it, then turns to the back of the magazine and starts to read. What he is so avidly interested in is the men's fashion section. There is a layout titled WHAT THE YOUNG EXECUTIVE WILL WEAR with a sub-head reading The Bowler is Back. Illustrating the article are several photographs of male models wearing various styles of bowlers. Bud is definitely in the market for a bowler, but somehow his mind starts wandering. He turns back to the overleaf again, unfolds it, studies it, then holds the magazine up vertically to get a different perspective on the subject. By now the sleeping pill is beginning to take effect, and he yawns. He drops the magazine on the floor, kills the light, settles down to sleep. The room is dark except for the glow from the dial of the electric blanket. Three seconds. Then the phone jangles shrilly in the living room. Bud stumbles groggily out of bed, and putting on his slippers, makes his way into the living room. He switches on the light, picks up the phone.</context>
      <utterance>And now, Grand Hotel -- starring Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan Crawford --  -- Wallace Beery, and Lionel Barrymore. But first -- a word from our alternate sponsor.  Friends, do you have wobbly dentures -- ?</utterance>

Tearing off the top sheet, he impales it on the spindle of the phonograph, then walks out, closing the door behind him. The note reads:</context>

Maybe it's the way she's put together, maybe it's her face, or maybe it's just the uniform -- in any case, there is something very appealing about her. She is also an individualist -- she wears a carnation in her lapel, which is strictly against regulations. As the elevator loads, she greets the passengers cheerfully.</context>
      <utterance>Yes, sir. They are indeed.</utterance>

      <context>Leaving Bud at the employees' coat-racks, Kirkeby heads toward his office, one of the glass-enclosed cubicles. Bud hangs up his hat and raincoat, stows away the gloves and muffler. Out of his coat pocket he takes a plastic anti- histamine sprayer and a box of cough drops, and still carrying the Kleenex, threads his way to his desk. Most of the desks are already occupied, and the others are filling rapidly. Once seated at his desk, Bud arranges his medicaments neatly in front of him. He takes a Kleenex out of the box, blows his nose, then leaning back in his swivel chair sprays first one nostril, then the other. Suddenly the piercing bell goes off -- the workday has begun. Being the ultra-conscientious type, Bud instantly sits upright in his chair, removes the cover from his computing machine, picks up a batch of perforated premium cards, starts entering figures on his computer. After a few seconds, he glances around to make sure that everybody in the vicinity is busy. Then he looks up a number in the company telephone directory, dials furtively.</context>

      <context>He hangs up, feels his forehead. It is warm. Clipped to his handkerchief pocket are a black fountain pen and, next to it, a thermometer in a black case. Bud unclips the thermometer case, unscrews the cap, shakes the thermometer out, puts it under his tongue. He resumes work. A messenger comes up to his desk with an interoffice envelope.</context>

      <utterance>Wait.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Puzzled by the whole procedure, the messenger leaves. Bud now removes the thermometer from his mouth, reads it. It's worse than he thought. He puts the thermometer back in the case, clips it to his pocket, takes his desk calendar out of a drawer, turns a leaf. Under the date WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 4 there is an entry in his handwriting -- MR. VANDERHOF. Bud consults the telephone directory again, picks up the phone, dials.</context>

      <utterance>Well, about six months ago -- I was going to night school, taking this course in Advanced Accounting -- and one of the guys in our department -- he lives in Jersey -- he was going to a banquet at the Biltmore -- his wife was meeting him in town, and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo -- so I gave him the key and word must have gotten around -- because the next thing I knew, all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets -- and when you give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand -- pardon me. He whips out the nasal-spray, administers a couple of quick squirts up each nostril.</utterance>

      <context>He leaves her outside the cubicle, and elbows his way through the crowd toward the booze-filled water cooler. Out of another cubicle comes Miss Olsen, cup in hand. She too has had quite a few. Seeing Fran, she walks up to her, with an acid smile on her face.</context>

      <context>He kisses her on the cheek, hurries out of the apartment, closing the door. Fran stands there for a while, blinking back tears, then takes the long-playing record out of its envelope, crosses to the phonograph. She puts the record on, starts the machine -- the music is JEALOUS LOVER. As it plays, Fran wanders aimlessly around the darkened room, her body wracked by sobs. Finally she regains control of herself, and picking up her handbag, starts through the bedroom toward the bathroom. In the bathroom, Fran switches on the light, puts her bag on the sink, turns on the faucet. Scooping up some water, she washes the smeared mascara away, then turns the faucet off, picks up a towel As she is drying her face, she notices in the pull-away shaving mirror the magnified reflection of a vial of pills on the medicine shelf. Fran reaches out for the vial, turns it slowly around in her hand. The label reads: SECONAL - ONE AT BEDTIME AS NEEDED FOR SLEEP. Fran studies the label for a second, then returns the vial to the shelf. She opens her handbag, takes out a lipstick. As she does so, she sees the hundred dollar bill Sheldrake left in the bag. Her eyes wander back to the vial on the medicine shelf. Then very deliberately she picks up Bud's mouthwash glass, removes the two toothbrushes from it, turns on the faucet, starts filling the glass with water.</context>

      <utterance>Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARGIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She takes the bowl of melted ice Bud has handed her, disappears into the kitchen. As Bud starts to remove his coat, he becomes aware of a scratching noise from the phonograph. He crosses to it, sees that the needle is stuck in the last groove of a long-playing record. Bud lifts the record off, examines it curiously, then puts it aside and substitutes the cha cha record. As the music starts, he dances over to the coat-rack beside the door, hangs up his chesterfield and bowler. He turns back into the room, still dancing, suddenly spots Fran's gloves on the coffee table. He picks up the gloves, looks around for some convenient place to get rid of them. Moving over to the bedroom door, he opens it, tosses the gloves toward the bed inside. He shuts the door, starts to turn away, freezes in a delayed reaction to something he saw inside. He quickly opens the door again, looks. Sprawled across the bed, on top of the bedspread, is Fran. The light from the bathroom falls across her. She is fully dressed, still in her coat, and apparently asleep. Bud steps into the bedroom, closing the door behind him, walks over to Fran.</context>
      <utterance>I'm with you, lover.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She doesn't respond. But something falls out of her hand, rolls across the bed. Bud picks it up, looks at it -- it is his sleeping-pill vial, now uncapped and empty.</context>
      <utterance>All right, Miss Kubelik -- get up. It's past checking-out time, and the hotel management would appreciate it if you would get the hell out of here.  Look, Miss Kubelik, I used to like you -- I used to like you a lot -- but it's all over between us -- so beat it -- O-U-T -- out!  Come on -- wake up!</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Fran's head droops to one side, like a rag doll's. Bud lets go of her, rushes out. In the living room, the phonograph is still cha cha-ing away. Bud dashes to the phone, picks it up. Then it occurs to him that he doesn't know whom to call and he hangs up. Out of the kitchen comes Margie, with a bowlful of ice cubes.</context>

   <speaker>MARGIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bud slams the door shut, starts toward the bedroom. Halfway there, he becomes aware that the cha cha record is still on. He detours to the phonograph, switches it off, continues into the bedroom. In the bedroom, the overhead light is on, and Dr. Dreyfuss is working on the unconscious Fran. He has removed her coat, and is shining a flashlight into her eyes, examining her pupils. Bud approaches the bed worriedly.</context>
      <utterance>You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!</utterance>
   <speaker>BUD</speaker>

   <speaker>BUD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dr. Dreyfuss ignores him. Out of his medical bag, he takes a stomach tube with a rubber funnel at the end. Then he starts to lift Fran off the bed.</context>
      <utterance>It was half-full -- about a dozen or so. You going to have to take her to the hospital?</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. DREYFUSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Between them, they get Fran into an upright position.</context>
      <utterance>Help me, will you?</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. DREYFUSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They half-carry, half-drag Fran's limp form toward the bathroom.</context>
      <utterance>Into the bathroom.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What are you going to do, Doc?</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. DREYFUSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bud starts away as Dr. Dreyfuss takes Fran into the bathroom. Bud loses no time getting into the kitchen. He fills an aluminum kettle with water, strikes a match, lights the gas burner, puts the kettle on. Then he takes a jar of instant coffee and a chipped coffee mug out of the cupboard, shakes an excessive portion of coffee into the mug, sticks a spoon in it. He watches the kettle for a moment, mops his brow with a handkerchief, then starts back toward the bedroom. Bud crosses the bedroom to the half-open door of the bathroom, looks in anxiously. From inside come the sounds of a coughing spasm and running water. Bud turns away, undoes his tie and collar, paces the bedroom floor. Something on the night table attracts his attention -- resting against the base of the lamp is a sealed envelope. Bud picks it up -- on it, in Fran's handwriting, is one word, JEFF. He turns the letter over in his hand, trying to decide what to do with it. Dr. Dreyfuss emerges from the bathroom, carrying a pale, still unconscious Fran. Bud quickly conceals the suicide note behind his back.</context>
      <utterance>Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. DREYFUSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He lugs Fran into the living room. Bud stashes the letter in his back pocket, picks up the medical bag, follows them. In the living room, Dr. Dreyfuss lowers Fran into a chair. Her chin falls to her chest. Dreyfuss takes the bag from Bud, fishes out a hypodermic syringe, draws 2 c.c.'s from a bottle of picrotoxin.</context>
      <utterance>Bring my bag.</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. DREYFUSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bud does so. Dr. Dreyfuss hands the hypodermic to Bud, searches for a spot for the injection.</context>
      <utterance>Roll up her right sleeve.</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. DREYFUSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He swabs the spot with alcohol, takes the hypodermic back from Bud.</context>
      <utterance>Nice veins.</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. DREYFUSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Want to tell me what happened?</utterance>
   <speaker>BUD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. DREYFUSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Something like that.</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. DREYFUSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bud just stands there, taking it. Fran stirs slightly, and from her parched lips comes a low moan. Dr. Dreyfuss grabs her by the hair, lifts her head up.</context>
      <utterance>You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. DREYFUSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>With his free hand, Dr. Dreyfuss slaps Fran viciously across the face. Bud winces. Dreyfuss, still holding Fran by the hair, takes a box of ammonia ampules out of his bag. He crushes one of the ampules in his hand, passes it under her nose. Fran tries to turn her head away. Dreyfuss slaps her again, hard, crushes another ampule, repeats the process. Bud is watching tensely. From the kitchen comes the whistle of the boiling kettle, but Bud pays no attention.</context>
      <utterance>If you'd come home half an hour later, you would have had quite a Christmas present.</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. DREYFUSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bud hurries into the kitchen. He turns off the gas, pours the boiling water into the mug with the instant coffee, stirs it. From off, come the sounds of more slapping and some moaning. Bud carries the coffee out. In the living room, Dr. Dreyfuss is working another ammonia ampule under Fran's nose. Her eyes start fluttering. Dreyfuss takes the coffee mug from Bud, forces it between Fran's lips, pours coffee into her mouth. Fran resists instinctively, half the coffee dribbling over her chin and dress, but Dr. Dreyfuss keeps at it.</context>
      <utterance>Get the coffee.</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. DREYFUSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bud complies promptly -- pulls up the shades, opens the windows wide.</context>

      <utterance>You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>He enters the score on the pad. As he starts to shuffle again, he notices that Fran has slid down on the pillow, and that her eyes are closed -- she is asleep. Bud rises, adjusts the blanket over her. He stands there looking at her for a moment, runs his hand over his chin. Realizing he needs a shave, he crosses to the bathroom. In the bathroom, Bud washes his face, squirts some shaving cream into his hand, starts to apply it.</context>
      <utterance>Fifty-two and twenty-five -- that's seventy-seven -- spades is double -- a hundred and fifty-four -- and four boxes -- you're blitzed in two games.</utterance>

I haven't told her yet, but I thought you should be the first to know. After all, you don't really want her, and I do, and although it may sound presumptuous, she needs somebody like me.

      <context>Bud closes the door, returns to the kitchen, brings out a box of glassware and the tennis racquet. As he starts to deposit the racquet in a carton, he notices a strand of spaghetti clinging to the strings.

      <context>The piano player is consulting the watch on his upraised left arm. He drops the arm in a signal, and the lights go out. At the same time, he strikes up AULD LANG SYNE. All over the dimly lit room, couples get to their feet, embracing and joining in the song. In the last booth, Sheldrake leans across the table, kisses Fran.</context>
      <utterance>I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHELDRAKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Fran's expression is preoccupied. Sheldrake faces in the direction of the pianist, and holding his glass aloft, sings along with the others. As AULD LANG SYNE comes to an end, the place explodes noisily -- there is a din of horns, ratchets, and shouted greetings. The lights come up again. In the last booth, Sheldrake turns back toward Fran -- but she is no longer there. Her paper hat lies abandoned on her vacated chair.</context>
