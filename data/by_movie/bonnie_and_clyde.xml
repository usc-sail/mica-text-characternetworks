   <speaker>CLYDE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He reaches over the counter into the cash drawer and grabs the bills. He smiles. Suddenly looming beside CLYDE is the BUTCHER, brandishing a meat cleaver. Camera looks up at this formidable sight as the cleaver comes crashing down, missing CLYDE and sticking in the wooden counter. He grabs CLYDE around the chest in a bear hug and actually lifts him off the ground. The struggle is in silence. CLYDE is terrified, fighting wildly to get free. The gun in CLYDE's hand is pinned, because the man has CLYDE's arm pinned to his thigh. CLYDE tries to raise the barrel at an upward angle to shoot, finally he is able to do so. He fires. The bullet enters the BUTCHER's stomach. The BUTCHER screams, but reacts like a wounded animal, more furious than ever. He still holds CLYDE in a fierce hug, staggering around the store, knocking into shelves and spilling cans. CLYDE is hysterical with fear. He shoots the BUTCHER again. The BUTCHER falls to his knees, but still he doesn't release CLYDE. In a panic, CLYDE drags the man to the door, trying to get out.</context>

They have been credited with robbing the Mesquite Bank in the aforementioned White City, the J.J. Landry Oil Refinery in Arp, Texas, the Sanger City National Bank in Denton, Texas on three different occasions. In addition to these robberies, the fast travelling Barrows have been rumored to have had a hand in the robbing of two Piggly Wiggly stores in Texas, and one A&amp;P store in Missouri, though Chief Percy Hammond, who first identified Clyde Barrow's brother, Buck, as a member of the gang, expressed some doubt that these last robberies were committed by the Barrow Gang alone.</utterance>

      <context>BRYCE spins around. Both men fire instanteously, but CLYDE has the draw on him, and the aim. The gun goes flying from the SHERIFF's hand. A really razzle-dazzle display of grandstand marksmanship from Clyde. Immediately the gang leaps from the car and surrounds the man, guns drawn.</context>

      <context>The gang grabs the man and takes his handcuffs from his belt. CLYDE makes him lean on the car's hood, arms extended, legs spread, while he frisks him. In general, everyone is excited over the capture. BONNIE takes the sheriff's gun and delicately places it on the radiator grill like an object d'art.</context>

      <context>Rev. angle across hood--so BRYCE's face, not visible to CLYDE or anyone else behind him, is in foreground. His gnarled, powerful hands tremble slightly on the hood, as tho they might crinkle the metal like so much tissue paper. His eyes stare toward camera relentlessly, unblinking, but without passion. They are shark's eyes. They have witnessed much carnage, devoured it, and are still wide open for more.</context>

BRYCE is literally ricocheted off the car by the force, and, with CLYDE hanging on by the cuffs, plummets down the embankment to the sandy beach below, both men falling, spinning. BRYCE rises shakily. He tries to walk away. CLYDE grabs him again by the handcuffs and hurls him out into the water. BRYCE smacks into a tree stump poking out of the shallows and goes down. CLYDE is on top of him. Meanwhile, BUCK has rushed down into the water, tries to pull CLYDE off BRYCE.</context>

He picks up one of BONNIE's scarves, now. As he runs on, he clears a knoll and BONNIE, her yellow hair unmistakable even at this distance, comes into view. She's far off in the cornfield, stalking off, looking neither to right nor left, carrying a brown paper sack that has split, from which she has occasionally lost clothing. CLYDE screams, "BONNIE." She apparently doesn't hear. Angle on cornfield. Day. As CLYDE gets closer. BONNIE herself suddenly breaks into flight, the paper bag splitting completely, the remaining clothes spilling out. There is a real chase where they each try to get the advantage. CLYDE is so exhausted from his run that he has real trouble cornering her as they maneuver up and down the rows of corn. Finally CLYDE catches up. Extreme close-up. BONNIE &amp; CLYDE. Day. As they tumble into the stalks of corn, mowing them down.</context>

      <utterance>"The Story of Bonnie and Clyde" You've heard the story of Jesse James-- Of how he lived and died: If you're still in need Of something to read Here's the story of Bonnie and Clyde. Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow Gang I'm sure you all have read How they rob and steal And those who squeal Are usually found dying or dead. They call them cold-hearted killers; They say they are heartless and mean; But I say this with pride, That I once knew Clyde When he was honest and upright and clean. But the laws fooled around, Kept taking him down And locking him in a cell, Till he said to me, "I'll never be free So I'll meet a few of them in hell." The road was so dimly lighted; There were no highway signs to guide; But they made up their minds If all roads were blind, They wouldn't give up till they died.</utterance>

      <utterance>The road gets dimmer and dimmer; Sometimes you can hardly see; But it's fight man to man, And do all you can, For they know they can never be free. From heartbreak some people have suffered; From weariness some people have died; But take it all in all, Our troubles are small, Till we get like Bonnie and Clyde.</utterance>
