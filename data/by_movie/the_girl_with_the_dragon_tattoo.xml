Short black-dyed hair - pierced eyelid - tattoo of a wasp on her neck; probably several more under her black leather jacket - black t- shirt, black jeans, black Caterpillar boots. Frode is only middlingly successful in concealing his initial reaction to her. This isn't punk fashion. This is someone saying, Stay the fuck away from me.</context>

      <utterance>Not in this case. I have to know if there's anything about him I might find unsavory - even if she doesn't.</utterance>
   <speaker>SALANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Frode thinks about that, perhaps imagining how much simpler his own life would be with such an arrangement.</context>
      <utterance>He's had a long sexual relationship with his co-editor. It wrecked his marriage, but not hers. Her husband accepts it. Sometimes she sleeps at Blomkvist's, sometimes at home.</utterance>

      <context>The circulation to Blomkvist's head is being cut off by the strap. His fingers behind his naked back claw at the concrete wall to try to relieve some of the weight on the noose, but can't get a grip. Martin watches the struggle calmly, and just as calmly offers:</context>
      <utterance>You know, I've never had a man in here. I've never touched a man as a matter of fact. Except my father, of course. But that was my duty. Harriet's, too.</utterance>

      <context>He pulls the strap, lifting Blomkvist's toes off the floor, closing off his air again ... and is about to gut him like a wild boar ... when he hears a sound like some kind of animal behind him ... He turns and sees her - coming at him from out of the shadows by the steel door - He darts for the gun he left on the workbench - Salander just as quickly swings a 5-iron - his 5-iron - like a baseball bat. Its metal-wedged end arcs through the gloom and slams into the side of his head, sending him tumbling to the floor. He struggles up to his knees, and she swings the club again, splitting flesh and crushing bone as he crumples the floor. She takes the gun from the bench and shoves it in her other back pocket. Grabs the hunting knife and shackles key and hurries over to Blomkvist who only witnessed part of the spectacle before losing consciousness - She saws through the leather strap around his neck. Unlocks the chain. As he sinks to his knees on the floor, blood rushes to his head, bringing him back to life just enough to see what she can't behind her - Martin, blood streaming from the gash in his head, getting to his feet. But he's not coming at them; he's trying to get out - Blomkvist tries to say her name to get her to look. Lifts a hand to try to point. She turns and glimpses the monster as he disappears out the steel door. Looks back at Blomkvist, still handcuffed on the floor, and, like a child asking a parent for permission -</context>

Sees out the picture window the taillights of Martin's car receding fast down the road as clouds burst. She bangs out the front door. Runs halfway down the hill in the rain to where she left her motorcycle, jumps on and kick-starts it.</context>
