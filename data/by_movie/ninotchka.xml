      <utterance>Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?</utterance>
   <speaker>BULJANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He exits toward the street. The Manager returns to his customary duties, when suddenly a second Russian, similarly dressed, pushes his way through the door and gazes around. It is Comrade Iranoff. The Manager, definitely mystified by now, approaches him.</context>
      <utterance>No, no.</utterance>
   <speaker>MANAGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, monsieur?</utterance>
   <speaker>IRANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Iranoff exits. Again the Manager returns to his duties, when suddenly he sees that a third man, dressed in the same fashion, has appeared in the revolving door. It is Comrade Kopalski. Kopalski doesn't leave the revolving door at all but as it turns, drinks in the whole spectacle of the lobby. The Manager is by now dumfounded.</context>
      <utterance>Just looking around.</utterance>

      <utterance>Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?</utterance>
   <speaker>ALL THREE</speaker>

      <utterance>Can you imagine what the beds would be in a hotel like that?</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.</utterance>
   <speaker>IRANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.</utterance>
   <speaker>BULJANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.</utterance>
   <speaker>IRANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?</utterance>
   <speaker>KOPALSKI</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?</utterance>
   <speaker>BULJANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Iranoff and Kopalski follow him reluctantly.</context>
      <utterance>I don't want to go to Siberia.</utterance>
   <speaker>IRANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."</utterance>
   <speaker>IRANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He wouldn't say that. What he would say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!"</utterance>
   <speaker>BULJANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>MANAGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.</utterance>
   <speaker>BULJANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The other two nod their agreement. The Manager has noted the single suitcase.</context>
      <utterance>Why should you be afraid?</utterance>
   <speaker>MANAGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?</utterance>
   <speaker>IRANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?</utterance>
   <speaker>MANAGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's even better.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But, gentlemen, I am afraid...</utterance>
   <speaker>BULJANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The other two exchange a look of agreement again.</context>
      <utterance>He's always afraid.</utterance>
   <speaker>MANAGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The mention of the Royal Suite startles the three.</context>
      <utterance>I just wanted to explain. The apartment may suit your convenience but I doubt that it will fit your convictions. It's the Royal Suite.</utterance>
   <speaker>BULJANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Three Russians take a step away from the manager and go into a huddle.</context>
      <utterance>Royal Suite!  Just a minute.</utterance>
   <speaker>BULJANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.</utterance>
   <speaker>IRANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The other two welcome the suggestion with relish.</context>
      <utterance>We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.</utterance>
   <speaker>BULJANOFF AND IRANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly Buljanoff grows skeptical again.</context>
      <utterance>That's right. Good, very good.</utterance>
   <speaker>BULJANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>For a moment all three see their bright plans crumble. Then Iranoff comes to the rescue.</context>
      <utterance>Of course, we could take out the pieces and distribute them in three or four boxes in the vault and take a small room. That's an idea, isn't it?</utterance>
   <speaker>IRANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Buljanoff and Kopalski see the logic of this and their faces light up.</context>
      <utterance>Yes, it's an idea, but who says we have to have an idea?</utterance>
   <speaker>BOTH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's right... that's right.</utterance>
   <speaker>BULJANOFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Manager leads the three toward the elevator. The CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM and NARROWS DOWN to the suitcase carried by two of the Russians.</context>

      <utterance>Yes. Gentlemen... let's put our cards face down. Right now there is a Russian commission in New York trying to sell fifteen Rembrandts. There is another in London mortgaging the oil fields in Baku. You need money and you need it quickly. I think my offer is fair and does not even take advantage of your situation.</utterance>

Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?</utterance>
   <speaker>LEON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A wonderful idea! Radio or records?</utterance>
   <speaker>NINOTCHKA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Leon turns on the victrola.</context>
      <utterance>Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He walks back to Ninotchka, who by now is seated in an armchair. He sits on the arm of the chair. He tries to make a declaration of his love. He stammers several words.</context>
      <utterance>I'll play it softly because I have things to tell you about which I can't shout.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>It is no use. In a sudden outburst of emotion he takes her in his arms and kisses her.</context>
      <utterance>Well, my darling... I... we...</utterance>
   <speaker>LEON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You see I couldn't shout that.</utterance>
   <speaker>NINOTCHKA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?</utterance>
   <speaker>LEON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No... go on.</utterance>
   <speaker>NINOTCHKA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They kiss again. As the kiss ends they look at each other for a second. Ninotchka gets up and goes toward the desk, sits in the desk chair, opens her handbag, which lies there, and takes from it a little mirror and a lipstick. Before she uses it she looks at Leon with guilty happiness. Leon looks at her with great tenderness and walks over to the desk and stands looking at her as she makes up her lips.</context>
      <utterance>Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...</utterance>
   <speaker>LEON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As soon as she is finished, Ninotchka slips the mirror and lipstick back into her handbag and, as she does so, glances at the top of the desk.</context>
      <utterance>What a gesture for a sergeant.</utterance>
   <speaker>NINOTCHKA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Leon, I would like to ask you something.</utterance>

      <utterance>I don't think so.</utterance>
   <speaker>NINOTCHKA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Leon too is completely serious by now. For answer he quietly opens the drawer of the desk. Ninotchka looks in and takes from the drawer the photograph. As she looks at it she rises.</context>
      <utterance>When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?</utterance>
   <speaker>NINOTCHKA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Leon nods gravely.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.</utterance>

   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>During the following scene Anna puts her cello in its case and gets ready to go to her job. Ninotchka starts to arrange the table in the center of the floor for a party of four. Out of her cupboard she takes very primitive-looking dishes, a flower pot, glasses, and a kind of shawl which serves as a tablecloth.</context>
      <utterance>No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.</utterance>
   <speaker>NINOTCHKA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Anna is apparently not a fanatical believer in the Bolshevik regime and takes a cynical and humorous attitude toward it.</context>
      <utterance>Didn't you march?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"</utterance>
   <speaker>NINOTCHKA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?</utterance>
   <speaker>NINOTCHKA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A few friends... just a little dinner party.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>

   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>

      <utterance>Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>

      <context>At this moment a door to one of the adjoining rooms opens and Gurganov, a middle-aged man with a sour stool-pigeon expression, walks quietly through the room to another door, taking in the girls with one sly glance and giving the impression that not only his eyes but his ears are open. Anna breaks off her remark.</context>
      <utterance>It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.</utterance>

      <context>She walks over to her cupboard and takes out a piece of lingerie and comes back to Ninotchka with it.</context>
      <utterance>You should. I'll show you.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.</utterance>
   <speaker>NINOTCHKA</speaker>

      <utterance>You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.</utterance>

      <context>Ninotchka suddenly is transported to Paris in her memory.</context>
      <utterance>Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?</utterance>

      <utterance>No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....</utterance>

      <utterance>Just for the honeymoon.</utterance>
   <speaker>NINOTCHKA</speaker>

   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Anna exits, closing the door. Ninotchka is left alone. Her thoughts are still in the other world, obviously with Leon. Mechanically she looks over the table to see if everything is all right, then she walks over to the radio (a primitive little machine). As she turns the knob she smiles again reminiscently. As she does, the blare of a Russian speech brings her back to reality.</context>

Realizing her feelings, the Three Russians walk to the far end of the room and sit down on a little bench, looking toward Ninotchka with childlike expectancy. In great anticipation Ninotchka opens the letter. She starts to read it. Suddenly her expression changes to one of terrific disappointment. She turns the letter over, glances at the second page, then puts the letter down on the table. The Russians have followed her expression closely. Slowly they walk over to her.</context>

In Leon's handwriting we read: "Ninotchka, my darling," The rest of the writing is blocked out, line by line, and across the page is a big stamp which says "Censored." Iranoff's hand turns the page. The second page is also censored except for the final words, "Yours, Leon."</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.</utterance>

      <context>Ninotchka has to suppress a smile of amusement at the antics of her three old friends.</context>
      <utterance>As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur.  This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every caf and night club. Here...  "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"</utterance>

      <utterance>Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.</utterance>

      <utterance>If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.</utterance>
