      <context>Benny and the officer look to where Mike is pointing. What appears to be the beam of a powerful headlight bobs among the houses below them. Further into the track another beam of light moves slightly from right to left but seems otherwise stationary.</context>

      <context>Carrying a shotgun the officer motions Benny and Mike to fan out on either side of him and, guns drawn, they cut across the tract to where they last saw the bobbing light. The fog quickly isolates them, heightening their fear. Each man becomes acutely aware of the loudness of his breathing and the crunch of his footsteps on the ground. They drift in and out of visual contact with each other. Benny freezes as he hears a burst of the high pitched whistle sweep by on his left. He turns slowly to see, through the ribs of an unfinished house, a shaft of the white light pointing at a cement mixer.</context>
      <utterance>This is the police. Identify yourselves. It is deathly silent.</utterance>
   <speaker>BENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The brilliant light swings toward him. Benny, his hands trembling, raises the gun.</context>
      <utterance>There's one over here...</utterance>
   <speaker>BENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The light fixes on Benny and terrified he shakes off a couple shots. The light goes out immediately.</context>

   <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Before Mike can answer, a strange percussive clicking sound is heard. He pumps a shell in the chamber of his shotgun and swallowing his fear moves toward the voices. They stop.</context>
      <utterance>You see anything, Mike?</utterance>
   <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Benny, his flashlight throwing a feeble beam in front of him, inches around the house looking for what he shot at. He gets to where it should be but it's not there. His light searches the area. There is nothing but a stack of lumber. Shaking visibly he shuffles to it and peers around its corner. Nothing. Benny relaxes and allows himself to breathe again.</context>
      <utterance>This is the police. Identify yourselves.</utterance>

   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Benny continues around the house. He flashes his light into a doorway. There is nothing but framing. When he moves on, a figure steps out of the darkness to fill the space, then raises its arms. With a sharp snap cylindrical devices swing off its wrist into its hands. At the corner of the house Benny hears the snap and stops. The high pitched whistle starts behind him. He stumbles around to face a brilliant white light flying directly at him. Benny screams in terror and fires at it. The light swerves and a laser streak from one of the hand rockets sears Benny's chest and knocks him to the ground in pain. Holding his shoulder he watches the light rise and fall erratically between the houses. The officers watch in awe as the beam wobbles through the air, then crashes to the earth.</context>
      <utterance>Okay...</utterance>

   <speaker>BENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The two men begin to trot toward the light. It swings wildly around and, accompanied by the high-pitched whistle, starts to stagger back up the hill. Benny and the officer break into a run. They are on their way up the hill when the light in front of them crashes to the earth. It rolls over and lays still, the beam shooting straight up into the air. Benny and the officer slow their pursuit, terrified of what they might find. Suddenly a high-pitched whistle is bearing down on them from behind. Before they can turn a light rockets over their heads. With a rumble the hill begins to vibrate. As they follow its flight, they see lights beginning to ripple to life across the skin of a saucer-shaped spacecraft resting at the edge of the forest on top of the hill. With a rumble the hill begins to vibrate. Frightened, the officers stop.</context>

The STAR MAN lapses into unconsciousness as we hear the truck pull away.</context>

      <utterance>I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive.

      <context>The gloved hands of the figure have only three fingers and a thumb. Shermin takes Bell's flashlight. He angles it at the faceplate. As he leans in to follow the beam, the pitch of the drill rises. He shifts the light. The drill breaks through and the faceplate explodes out of the helmet. The men throw themselves back in panic. When they turn back to look, distorted impressions of the face inside the helmet reflect on the glass of their contamination hoods. (Pause)</context>

When he pulls them apart, a blue force field pulses between them. He stops at shoulder width. A solarized aerial view of the United States forms on the force field. A green dot appears in the area of western Wisconsin, a red dot in the area of Death Valley, California. He drops his hands to his lap and sits very still. The solarized compass remains floating in the air in front of him. After a long moment he reaches up and squeezes it into a ball that disappears when his palms come together.</context>

      <context>She turns around and looks down indecisively, then hurries upstairs. A light goes on in the bedroom. The STAR MAN backs away to look up at it. He can't see anything. He is on his way to try and get in the side door when Jenny comes clumping down the stairs in an old sweatshirt and pulling on a pair of jeans. She disappears into the kitchen. Without warning the door ahead of him is swung open and Jenny rushes out. The STAR MAN barely has time to step into the shadows. Jenny grabs the handle of one of the garbage cans lined against the house and drags it down to the street. When she comes back for the second one we see that the STAR MAN is no longer in the shadows.</context>

      <context>Jenny bolts for the front door. At the end of the hallway her foot catches in a phone cord pulling the phone off an end table. The receiver is jarred out of its cradle. Jenny regains her balance and gets to the door ahead of the STAR MAN. She jerks it open, but the guard chain stops it three inches from the jamb. Frantically, she tries again but the chain holds. The STAR MAN slams the door shut and reaches out to grab her. She flails back at him. One of her hands strikes the panel on his chest and the identification light comes on inside his helmet. At the sight of the STAR MAN, Jenny begins to scream. He presses her back against the wall and puts a mittened hand over her mouth.</context>

      <context>Holding her with his eyes he grasps one of Jenny's hands and lifts it up to look at it. He raises a piece of skin off her wrist, rolls it between his thumb and forefinger. Jenny lets out a blood-curdling scream and strikes out at him. Flashes of light erupt off his exposed chest where she hits. The ferocity of her attack knocks him aside and she sprints up the stairs. The STAR MAN recovers and starts after her.</context>

      <context>He takes the door from her and pushes it open for a look inside. Jenny ducks into the ladies' room. He is confused for a moment then takes a long look at the men's room. It means nothing to him. He backs out and tries the ladies' room. It is locked. Not knowing what to do, the STAR MAN stands uncomfortably in front of the door, then like a child waiting for his mother, he sits on the curb. He watches the Attendant lift the Mustang's hood and reach in for the dipstick. The numbers on the pumps turn over, adding up the gallons and the cost of the gas. Everything is peaceful and quiet within the circle of light cast by the gas station. The STAR MAN pulls the camera disc out of his pocket and points it at the pumps. The cone of light flashes out and pulls back its three-dimensional image. The Attendant turns around and waves genially at the STAR MAN, who waves back a perfect imitation of the gesture. The SHARP RUMBLE of a SOUPED-UP HONDA MOTORCYCLE coming up the off-ramp shatters the mood and the STAR MAN gets to his feet. He is startled by the image of the RIDER. In a one piece driving skin and helmet he looks amazingly like a space traveller. The STAR MAN steps cautiously forward for a better look and mutters something to himself in his language. The rider stops his bike at the second row of pumps and swings himself stiffly out of the seat.</context>

      <utterance>That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha.

      <context>The WIND snapping the polyethylene is the only answer she gets. She picks her blouse off the floor next to her purse, but throws it aside and shrugs into the windbreaker when she sees the blood and bullet holes. Her sudden rise to a standing position makes her light-headed and she has to lean against the doorway until the spinning stops. With her hands outstretched, as guards against the sway of the truck, Jenny shuffles down the hallway.</context>

      <context>There is no one in the kitchen and she continues into the living room. It is empty. Jenny opens the door to an enclosed back porch. It is also empty. The STAR MAN is gone. She returns to the living room and stands there not really knowing what to do next. The countryside rushes by outside a floor- to-ceiling picture window. A WAIL FROM the semi's AIR HORN jars Jenny out of her reverie and she goes to press her cheek against the window. She is looking past her left hand at the road when she notices a wide green ring on her finger above her wedding band. She steps back from the window to examine it, then with some trepidation, twists it off. As it clears the end of her finger, the STAR MAN's VOICE SPEAKS OUT OF IT.</context>

      <context>Jenny drops the ring as if she'd been stung. The STAR MAN's voice stops as soon as she does and the ring bounces across the floor until it hits the baseboard. It looks innocent enough lying there, but Jenny has a great deal of trouble making herself approach it. When she finally picks it up, it does nothing. She turns it in her hand and when the side of the ring hole that was facing her when she took the ring off faces her again, the STAR MAN's VOICE CONTINUES.</context>

Jenny turns away from the window and finds that she is able to watch the conversation in a strip of mirrors that runs around the top of the pie case.

      <context>She brushes her lips against his. The STAR MAN's not sure what's happening. But he's not offended. Her next kiss is full and long. He accepts it with his eyes open and when she eases back he leans in for more. Jenny responds. As if on command, the satel compass comes from around behind the STAR MAN to hover in back of Jenny. He takes it between his palms and extinguishes it.</context>

At the counter Jenny explains to the clerk that she is hitchhiking and wants the busiest route into Death Valley without going through Lathrop Wells. The STAR MAN looks long and hard at the machine before putting in his last quarter. He pulls the handle.

She looks around to see if anybody else has noticed. They haven't. The STAR MAN smiles at her. The force field does it's work. A picket line of 7's fills the view window.
