      <utterance>Who are you?</utterance>
   <speaker>DEATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I am Death.</utterance>
   <speaker>KNIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Have you come for me?</utterance>
   <speaker>DEATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have been walking by your side for a long time.</utterance>
   <speaker>KNIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That I know.</utterance>
   <speaker>DEATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Are you prepared?</utterance>
   <speaker>KNIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>My body is frightened, but I am not.</utterance>
   <speaker>DEATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The KNIGHT has risen to his feet. He shivers. DEATH opens his cloak to place it around the KNIGHT'S shoulders.</context>
      <utterance>Well, there is no shame in that.</utterance>
   <speaker>KNIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Wait a moment.</utterance>
   <speaker>DEATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's what they all say. I grant no reprieves.</utterance>
   <speaker>KNIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A gleam of interest kindles in DEATH'S eyes.</context>
      <utterance>You play chess, don't you?</utterance>
   <speaker>DEATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How did you know that?</utterance>
   <speaker>KNIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have seen it in paintings and heard it sung in ballads.</utterance>
   <speaker>DEATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, in fact I'm quite a good chess player.</utterance>
   <speaker>KNIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The KNIGHT rummages in the big black bag which he keeps beside him and takes out a small chessboard. He places it carefully on the ground and begins setting up the pieces.</context>
      <utterance>But you can't be better than I am.</utterance>
   <speaker>DEATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why do you want to play chess with me?</utterance>
   <speaker>KNIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have my reasons.</utterance>
   <speaker>DEATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That is your privilege.</utterance>
   <speaker>KNIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The KNIGHT holds out his two fists to DEATH, who smiles at him suddenly. DEATH points to one of the KNIGHT'S hands; it contains a black pawn.</context>
      <utterance>The condition is that I may live as long as I hold out against you. If I win, you will release me. Is it agreed?</utterance>
   <speaker>KNIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You drew black!</utterance>
   <speaker>DEATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The KNIGHT and DEATH bend over the chessboard. After a moment of hesitation, Antonius Block opens with his king's pawn. DEATH moves, also using his king's pawn.</context>
      <utterance>Very appropriate. Don't you think so?</utterance>

<dialogue id="2" n_utterances="2">
   <speaker>JONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JONS finally gets the KNIGHT'S attention. He stops singing. The KNIGHT, his horse, JONS'S own horse and JONS himself know all the songs by heart. The long, dusty journey from the Holy Land hasn't made them any cleaner. They ride across a mossy heath which stretches towards the horizon. Beyond it, the sea lies shimmering in the white glitter of the sun.</context>
      <utterance>Up above is God Almighty So very far away, But your brother the Devil You will meet on every level.</utterance>
   <speaker>JONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>In Fâ€°rjestad everyone was talking about evil omens and other horrible things. Two horses had eaten each other in the night, and, in the churchyard, graves had been opened and the remains of corpses scattered all over the place. Yesterday afternoon there were as many as four suns in the heavens.</utterance>

   <speaker>KNIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, did he show you the way?</utterance>
   <speaker>JONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not exactly.</utterance>
   <speaker>KNIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What did he say?</utterance>
   <speaker>JONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nothing.</utterance>
   <speaker>KNIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Was he a mute?</utterance>
   <speaker>JONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, sir, I wouldn't say that. As a matter of fact, he was quite eloquent.</utterance>
   <speaker>KNIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh?</utterance>
   <speaker>JONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He was eloquent, all right. The trouble is that what he had to say was most depressing.  One moment you're bright and lively, The next you're crawling with worms. Fate is a terrible villain And you, my friend, its poor victim.</utterance>
   <speaker>KNIGHT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Must you sing?</utterance>
   <speaker>JONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The KNIGHT hands his squire a piece of bread, which keeps him quiet for a while. The sun burns down on them cruelly, and beads of perspiration trickle down their faces. There is a cloud of dust around the horses' hooves. They ride past an inlet and along verdant groves. In the shade of some large trees stands a bulging wagon covered with a mottled canvas. A horse whinnies nearby and is answered by the KNIGHT'S horse. The two travelers do not stop to rest under the shade of the trees but continue riding until they disappear at the bend of the road.</context>
      <utterance>No.</utterance>

<dialogue id="4" n_utterances="27">
   <speaker>JOF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He has picked up the juggling balls and slowly begins to toss them. Then he stands on his head and cackles like a hen. Suddenly he stops and sits down with a look of utter astonishment on his face. The wind causes the trees to sway slightly. The leaves stir and there is a soft murmur. The flowers and the grass bend gracefully, and somewhere a bird raises its voice in a long warble. JOF'S face breaks into a smile and his eyes fill with tears. With a dazed expression he sits flat on his behind while the grass rustles softly, and bees and butterflies hum around his head. The unseen bird continues to sing. Suddenly the breeze stops blowing, the bird stops singing, JOF'S smile fades, the flowers and grass wilt in the heat. The old horse is still walking around grazing and swishing its tail to ward off the flies. JOF comes to life. He rushes into the wagon and shakes MIA awake.</context>
      <utterance>Good morning. Have you had breakfast? I can't eat grass, worse luck. Can't you teach me how? We're a little hard up. People aren't very interested in juggling in this part of the country.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mia, wake up. Wake up! Mia, I've just seen something. I've got to tell you about it!</utterance>
   <speaker>MIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What is it? What's happened?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Listen, I've had a vision. No, it wasn't a vision. It was real, absolutely real.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MIA's voice is filled with gentle irony. JOF shakes his head and grabs her by the shoulders.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, so you've had a vision again!</utterance>
   <speaker>JOF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But I did see her!</utterance>
   <speaker>MIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Whom did you see?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MIA can't help being impressed by her husband's fervor. She lowers her voice.</context>
      <utterance>The Virgin Mary.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Did you really see her?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>touched her. She had a golden crown on her head and wore a blue gown with flowers of gold. She was barefoot and had small brown hands with which she was holding the Child and teaching Him to walk. And then she saw me watching her and she smiled at me. My eyes filled with tears and when I wiped them away, she had disappeared. And everything became so still in the sky and on the earth. Can you understand ...</context>
      <utterance>She was so close to me that I could have</utterance>
   <speaker>MIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What an imagination you have.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You don't believe me! But it was real, I tell you, not the kind of reality you see every day, but a different kind.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Perhaps it was the kind of reality you told us about when you saw the Devil painting our wagon wheels red, using his tail as a brush.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why must you keep bringing that up?</utterance>
   <speaker>MIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And then you discovered that you had red paint under your nails.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>I did it just so that you would believe in my other visions. The real ones. The ones that I didn't make up.</context>
      <utterance>Well, perhaps that time I made it up.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If we would only get some rain. Everything is burned to cinders. We won't have anything to eat this winter.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He says this smilingly, with a casual air. He stretches and laughs contentedly.</context>
      <utterance>We'll get by.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I want Mikael to have a better life than ours.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mikael will grow up to be a great acrobat -- or a juggler who can do the one impossible trick.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's that?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>To make one of the balls stand absolutely still in the air.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But that's impossible.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Impossible for us -- but not for him.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She yawns. The sun, has made her a bit drowsy and she lies down on the grass. JOF does likewise and puts one arm around his wife's shoulders.</context>
      <utterance>You're dreaming again.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I've composed a song. I made it up during the night when I couldn't sleep. Do you want to hear it?</utterance>

      <utterance>Sing it. I'm very curious.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>He interrupts his singing in order to be complimented by his wife.</context>
      <utterance>On a lily branch a dove is perched Against the summer sky, She sings a wondrous song of Christ And there's great joy on high.</utterance>

      <context>JOF is a bit offended and glances over at his son, MIKAEL, but he is also sleeping soundly in the high grass. JONAS SKAT comes out from the wagon. He yawns; he is very tired and in a bad humor. In his hands he holds a crudely made death mask.</context>

      <context>MIA is awake now and lies contentedly on her back, sucking on a blade of grass and looking smilingly at her husband.</context>

On the ceiling beam there is a representation of a hideous devil spying on a miserable human being. The KNIGHT hears a sound from the confession booth and approaches it. The face of DEATH appears behind the grille for an instant, but the KNIGHT doesn't see him.</context>

Her eyes are wide open, yet she doesn't appear to be fully conscious. JONS and the KNIGHT stop and watch in silence. The soldiers are working quickly and skillfully, but they seem frightened and dejected. The monk mumbles from a small book. One of the soldiers picks up a wooden bucket and with his hand begins to smear a bloody paste on the wall of the church and around the woman. JONS holds his nose.</context>

      <context>The soldiers pull the iron and the chains. TYAN'S shaven head sways, gleaming in the moonlight. Her blackened mouth opens as if to scream, but no sound emerges. They take her down from the cart and lead her towards the ladder and the stake. The KNIGHT turns to the MONK, who remains seated in the cart.</context>

For a few confusing moments the two rivals stumble among the stones and bushes in the gray gloom of the forest. The duel begins to look senseless, because both of them are equally frightened. The travelers silently observe this confused performance. LISA screams once in a while, more out of duty than out of impulse.</context>

      <context>SKAT lies in the grass and keeps the dagger pressed tightly to his breast. The travelers depart and soon they have disappeared into the dark forest on the other side of the meadow. When SKAT is sure that no one can see him, he sits up and lifts the dagger from his breast. It is a stage dagger with a blade that pushes into the handle. SKAT laughs to himself.</context>

MIA, JOF and their child have sat down apart from the others. They look at the light of the moon, which is no longer full and dead but mysterious and unstable.

      <context>JOF gets up carefully and disappears into the darkness behind the trees. MIA remains standing, as if paralyzed by fear. She stares fixedly at the KNIGHT and the chess game. She holds her son in her arms. Now JOF returns.</context>

      <context>The KNIGHT wants to answer, but DEATH is already gone. A murmur is heard in the tree tops. Dawn comes, a flickering light without life, making the forest seem threatening and evil. JOF drives over the twisting road. MIA sits beside him.</context>

   <speaker>MIA</speaker>

      <context>The wagon rattles over roots and stones; it sways and creaks. Now the horse stops with his ears flat against his head. The forest sighs and stirs ponderously.</context>

   <speaker>JOF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They crawl into the wagon and crouch around the sleeping child.</context>

      <context>She shivers as if she had a fever. They pull the blankets over them and lie closely together. The wagon canvas flutters and beats in the wind. The roar outside is like a giant bellowing.</context>
