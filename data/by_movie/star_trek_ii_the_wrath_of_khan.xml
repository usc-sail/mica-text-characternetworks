      <utterance>Yes... come.</utterance>

      <utterance>I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?</utterance>

      <utterance>No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.</utterance>

      <utterance>I didn't expect anything.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --</utterance>
   <speaker>KIRK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>

      <utterance>You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>It was just words.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.</utterance>

      <utterance>So am I. My friends were killed, too.</utterance>
   <speaker>KIRK</speaker>

      <context>Pause. They study each other.</context>

      <utterance>I was wrong about you. And</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A stunned moment, then Kirk lets it all hang out: for David, for Carol and for Spock. He hugs his son, hold- ing onto him as if to life itself.</context>
      <utterance>Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.</utterance>
