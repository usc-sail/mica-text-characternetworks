      <context></context>
      <utterance>A little entertainment for the men, sir. Tonight's Christmas Eve.</utterance>
   <speaker>GENERAL CARLTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The jeep has come to a halt.</context>
      <utterance>These men are moving up tonight. They should be lined up for full inspection!</utterance>
   <speaker>GENERAL WAVERLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're absolutely right.  There's no Christmas in the Army, Colonel.</utterance>
   <speaker>ADJUTANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Waverly and the Adjutant alight from the jeep.</context>
      <utterance>Yes, sir.</utterance>
   <speaker>GENERAL WAVERLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>There's always a slip-up or two during a change in command. The men get a little loose. But I know I'm leaving them in good hands.</utterance>
   <speaker>GENERAL CARLTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Sergeant looks at General Waverly.</context>
      <utterance>Thank you.  Sergeant, take me to headquarters immediately! We'll have those men turned out on the double!</utterance>
   <speaker>GENERAL WAVERLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Goodbye, Sergeant. Take the short cut.</utterance>
   <speaker>SERGEANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The jeep pulls off and makes a half circle. The Adjutant makes a gesture, as if to stop it. The General stops him.</context>
      <utterance>Yes, sir!</utterance>
   <speaker>ADJUTANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's not the way to headquarters!</utterance>
   <speaker>GENERAL WAVERLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Joe, you know that, and I know that, but the new General doesn't know it. Or he won't for about an hour and a half.</utterance>
   <speaker>ADJUTANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That Sergeant'll be a private tomorrow!</utterance>
   <speaker>GENERAL WAVERLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He takes the Adjutant by the arm and leads him toward the recreation area.</context>
      <utterance>Yes... isn't he lucky?</utterance>

      <context>The boys respond with "Merry Christmas".</context>
      <utterance>Captain Wallace, button your shirt. You're out of uniform!  This division is now under the command of General Harold G. Carlton, and I don't want anyone to forget it -- not that he'll let you. He's tough -- just what this sloppy outfit needs. You'll be standing inspection night and day -- you may even learn how to march. And if you don't give him everything you got, I may come back and fight for the enemy. Merry Christmas!</utterance>
   <speaker>GENERAL WAVERLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well -- I guess that's about it - uh - uh -- Bob, covering his embarrassment:</utterance>
   <speaker>BOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He turns to the musicians, gives the downbeat. They play THE OLD MAN, which is sung by the entire outfit. The General stands at attention through the first chorus, visibly moved. During the second chorus he starts up the aisle, revealing for the first time that his left leg is bandaged to the knee. The Adjutant puts out his arm to help. Waverly refuses. Toward the finish of the song, he turns, faces the men and salutes them. The men return the salute. (This is not a military mistake, the General salutes the enlisted men as a deliberate gesture.) There is a Red Cross ambulance standing by.</context>
      <utterance>Perhaps I can help you out, sir.</utterance>

      <utterance>Four feet two inches tall. Pudgy. Round races. Have big bows in their hair. Always smiling.  Lots of teeth. Sister acts have more teeth than anybody else. Two, three hundred teeth at a time. The American Dental Association is investigating it.</utterance>

      <context>The orchestra blends into a vocal chorus of the song. (To be decided upon.) The vocal is shared by Bob, Betty, Judy and Phil, individually. Toward the end of the vocal Phil dances Judy out to the terrace overlooking the water. This blends into their dance. The staging of the number should reunite the four principals by the end of the number. The audience applauds and they all go back to their booth.</context>

He looks through them, eagerly, then, downcast, shoves them in his overalls and goes back to his work.</context>

He takes a pillow from a nearby chair and puts it between her head and her chair. She waits, eyes closed, expectantly. But Bob gets to his feet, and carefully tiptoes to the door and exits, closing it softly behind him. After a moment, Betty snaps on the light, throws the pillow on the floor, and rests her chin in her hand, disappointed and wide awake.</context>
