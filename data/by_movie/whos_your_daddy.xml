      <context>Descending through the clouds, we are caught for a moment in a dreamy gauze. We emerge to find ourselves gliding above a small town. Descending lower. And lower. To Xenia, Ohio.</context>

      <context>We pass over the town square. A fine spring day in middle America. Red brick buildings with names like "Miller &amp; Son Drugs," "Two Sisters Gifts," "Nelson Family Market." You can almost smell the rosy cheeks and moral fiber.</context>
      <utterance>...But a lot of clichs get to be clichs because they're true. Your life CAN change in the blink of an eye. What I mean is, one day you're a regular chump, a wannabe something. You're not even totally sure WHAT you wannabe...</utterance>

      <context>PRINCIPAL RICHARD MERKIN, mid-50's, marches down the hallway, seizing copies of "EXPOSED!" from students' hands. We can see that it is a "homemade" looking newspaper. And there's obviously much ado about it. Christy winks at Ted as she hides the newspaper in her locker. FREEZE FRAME ON Christy, WINKING.</context>
      <utterance>Hand them over! Immediately!</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look at that smile. That wink. That's no platonic wink. That's a wink that says, "I don't just want you, Ted. I NEED you." So of course I had to ask her to the prom. I mean, she was practically begging for it.</utterance>

Until she's completely submerged. Ted looks startled. The "Jaws" theme echoes through his ears. He starts to rise. Concerned. When suddenly, he feels something. Whoa! His swimming trunks land next to him. He starts to rise out of the Jacuzzi, when suddenly he's sucked under. He thrashes. His hand grabs the edge of the Jacuzzi. But his fingers give out. And he slides under. Only to rise out of the water with Ginger. Attached to his lips. Kissing him passionately.</context>

It's comforting, you know? It fulfills their expectations.</utterance>
