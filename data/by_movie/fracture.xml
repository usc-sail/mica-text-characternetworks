      <context>She hesitates a second, glancing at the bottle. Crawford ignores her, pulling an x-ray off the light-box and grabbing his jacket - - which knocks over the bottle. It skitters across the desk, liquor spilling. Crawford just walks out past Tina.</context>

      <context>Beat. Rob nods.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>I want to wake up with you. I want to... He gropes for words, but it's too big and he relents - scales back, sighing:</context>
      <utterance>Okay.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She regards him tenderly, feeling the same reckless yearning. But also fear. She rubs his hair.</context>

      <utterance>My name is Lieutenant Robert Nunally. I'm a hostage negotiator for the Los - Crawford hangs up. Thoughtful.</utterance>

   <speaker>NUNALLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nunally grimaces, shuts his phone, shaking his head. But then he turns - with the SWAT Commander and everyone else - - as Crawford's front door unlocks and opens a few inches. Nunally considers this, looks at the SWAT COMMANDER.</context>
      <utterance>Mr. Crawford?</utterance>
   <speaker>NUNALLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He pulls his suit jacket back on, then reaches into the trunk for his back-up gun. He tucks it into the back of his belt, concealed under the jacket. He takes a walkie-talkie and starts for the house. The spectators fall silent. Radios crackle and hiss as he heads up the driveway.</context>
      <utterance>Okay then. Here we go.</utterance>

      <context>Crawford studies him, staying back.</context>
      <utterance>Hey.</utterance>
   <speaker>CRAWFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nunally is confused; Crawford gestures at the flood-lit lawn outside. Nunally glances back, sees the SWAT teams and - down the street - the distant barricades, the media. He nods, steps in and lets the door shut. Careful silence.</context>
      <utterance>Get rid of the vampires.</utterance>

   <speaker>CRAWFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nunally nods, humoring him, glancing around. Sees the small pool of blood where Jennifer fell. Plays it cool.</context>
      <utterance>Not vampires. Ghouls. Sorry.</utterance>
   <speaker>NUNALLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Crawford sighs.</context>
      <utterance>Mr. Crawford, what do you say you give me the gun - so I can pay more attention to what you're saying?</utterance>
   <speaker>CRAWFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is that your best shot?  So to speak.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I just think - maybe it would -</utterance>
   <speaker>CRAWFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Crawford moves to the coffee table in the center of the room, holds his gun out over it.</context>
      <utterance>Tell you what: I will if you will. Nunally frowns, wary.</utterance>
   <speaker>CRAWFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Crawford gestures to a chair across the room - by the foyer door, near Nunally.</context>
      <utterance>We both put down our guns. At the same time.</utterance>
   <speaker>CRAWFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nunally studies Crawford...and the gun, hovering above the coffee table. Looking for a trick, a catch. But there isn't one. If Crawford sets down his gun and steps away, he'll be standing in the open center of the room.</context>
      <utterance>We set them down and step away.  Then you can "pay more attention" to what I'm saying.</utterance>

   <speaker>CRAWFORD</speaker>

      <context>Nunally stares Crawford in the eyes - - then slowly takes his gun from his shoulder holster. Eyes on each other from across the room - moving very slowly - the two men cautiously set down their guns - - and step away. Crawford smiles. Nunally smiles, too, reassuring and false. Begins to edge forward - alert to the possibility of a lunge for the gun or having another weapon. But Crawford stays absolutely still.</context>
      <utterance>Happy ending, then.</utterance>

   <speaker>CRAWFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Crawford gestures to a library alcove, behind him, out of view.</context>
      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>NUNALLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nunally begins to drift slowly to the side, to see.</context>
      <utterance>Is she all right?</utterance>
   <speaker>CRAWFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nunally's nodding, edging to look into the alcove -</context>
      <utterance>I don't think she is. I shot her, Rob.</utterance>

      <utterance>- okay - I hear you -</utterance>
   <speaker>CRAWFORD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But Nunally is not. He's frozen - staring, shocked, at the back wall of the alcove - which he can now see. There's a big framed black-white photograph: a portrait of Jennifer Crawford.</context>
      <utterance>And I shot her in the head. I know it was wrong.  Are you listening to me?</utterance>
   <speaker>NUNALLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nunally fumbles for his walkie-talkie, rushing past Crawford toward the alcove - - kneeling by Jennifer, who lies, face-up in a red puddle -</context>
      <utterance>Oh Jesus Christ.</utterance>
   <speaker>NUNALLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nunally feels her neck frantically for a pulse - looking in her open, vacant eyes for some sign -</context>
      <utterance>We need a medic in here! Get the ambulance up! RIGHT NOW! NOW! NOW!</utterance>
   <speaker>NUNALLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nunally desperately starts C.P.R., his hands getting bloody. He stops to check her neck for a pulse now and then - - as Crawford slowly approaches from the living room, standing behind Nunally. Cold.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You know, I think I read somewhere that a good place to find a pulse is the femoral artery. It's on the inner surface of the upper thigh. If you put your fingers - you know, right up inside her dress -</utterance>

Outside, the police car doors open and then slam. Crawford, going pale, watches the metal ball roll off the coffee-table and across the floor toward him. Crawford doesn't move. Trying to focus. His mind working. The ball comes to rest against Crawford's shoe. The doorbell rings. Crawford looks up. Meeting Willy's eyes. Smiling slightly, Willy tucks Nunally's gun into his belt and puts his hands in the air. And gives Crawford a wink. Crawford is staring at Willy, frozen - panic and hatred and fear curdling in his eyes - - as behind him, the police begin pounding on the front door.</context>
