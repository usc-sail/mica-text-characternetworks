      <utterance>We all gather here on this special occasion. To listen to my pops, he's your west coast liaison. A speech from him, dude, is like sex with a hoochi. It's hot and excitin', like shoppin' at Gucci! Asians, Jews, Mexicans, too. Everybody's votin', yo, it's a cultural stew. Once he's in office you'll experience great riches. As a thank you for helpin', you can get wit my bitches! Let's get Glucked! Y'all get Glucked! We get Glucked! Come on everybody put your hands up!</utterance>
