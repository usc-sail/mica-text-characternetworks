I go to get the cigar and BOOM! All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go. Right where I was standin'. That coulda been it. I coulda had my head blown off and for what? Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over. If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.</utterance>

Who knows? But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.

Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true! Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit. Now -- I get it. Am I right, Leon?</utterance>

      <context>Jordy throws a look at Korfin. Homicide detectives have no respect for fire marshals' investigative skills.

   <speaker>KORFIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Leon looks at Jordy, then lowers the handkerchief. Jordy turns back to the corpses on the bed. Eddie - in the other room - has found Tamina's brushed gold bracelet on the floor.</context>
      <utterance>But you knew that, right?</utterance>
   <speaker>JORDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?</utterance>

   <speaker>LEON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Leon watches Jordy, quietly. With a pair of tweezers, Jordy pulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the heads. Korfin supplies the paint can. Jordy drops the cloth inside.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.</utterance>

   <speaker>JORDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>CAMELLO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>(to Eddie and Leon) Excuse me, gentlemen. You might wanna back up a little more. Don't wanna get your pants wet. Leon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV set. Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon. As Camello hacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the bodies and Korfin explains:</context>
      <utterance>No problem.</utterance>
   <speaker>KORFIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for something.</context>
      <utterance>They have not soot in their mouths, which means they weren't breathin' before the fire and that usually means they were deceased - and this piece of cloth that my partner found means they were wrapped up in something, probably doused with a flammable liquid and positioned like this on the bed. To the untrained eye, it looks like an accident.</utterance>

      <utterance>Good evening, I'm Robert Hawkins and this is Top Story. Tonight we bring you an exclusive interview with Stephen Geller - who horrified the nation two years ago when he went berserk and murdered three clerks in a Manhattan shoe store. But now, Mr. Geller's claim, spoken softly and articulately, is that he is the victim. According to Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful day were not his fault but were the fault of his psychiatrist. Hard to believe...watch.</utterance>

      <context>Oleg's hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the volume. The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being interviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew. He's sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint stained shirt. A showing of his artwork is displayed in the background. Patients peruse the paintings of weird dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact. One of the paintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson.</context>

      <utterance>You were right, they were both dead before the fire. The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine. That's usually an indicator of something personal.</utterance>

      <utterance>Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this. I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something. Maybe she was visiting somebody here. Who knows?</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to Jordy.</context>
      <utterance>Obviously they weren't having sex. As you pointed out. So why go through all the trouble of putting 'em like that?</utterance>
   <speaker>JORDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message. Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe. It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, just her in the shower. Nothing happened. Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it. I mean, to say the least, you outta know better. You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over. You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.</utterance>

      <utterance>But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody? I mean, you shoulda heard her there. Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer. Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer. That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that. You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case. And lemme give you another piece of advice. Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television. And when you get out there, they know your face. And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job. And I get more done because of it. Jordy studies Eddie for a quiet beat.</utterance>

Eddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at him from the wall. Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa. Falling on top of him, rolling over and leaving Oleg on the sofa. Eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the gun. Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is not clear in the darkness who has the gun. Oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the videocamera. Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the window and one of the lampshades off the lamp. Oleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in the stomach.

And on top of one nail...is Eddie's gold shield.</context>

It's creaking - but he's having a hard time with it.</context>

Jordy begins pulling at the rusty pipe with all his might. Daphne comes over - helps him. Both of them trying to break it off. Suddenly it snaps and water POURS into the room. SOAKING THE WALLS. They point the pipe toward the door, soaking some of the flames which are consuming the door. Trying to stop the fire from coming in. He and Daphne are drenched. And trapped. Jordy grabs a broken piece of pipe. Starts SMASHING the wall behind them. The wall to the adjacent apartment.</context>

      <utterance>Good evening. Welcome to "Top Story". Tonight, I present to you material of a graphic and violent nature never before seen on television. And I do so with a heavy heart. You will be first-hand witness to the slaying of celebrated New York City Homicide Detective, Eddie Flemming. It would be only normal to ask, why? Why are we showing something so journalist, I must show it. A democracy survives through the freedom of its media, and if we cannot see what is happening then we don't deserve our democracy, or our freedom. Eddie Flemming was my friend. I cried when I watched this footage and vowed to fight this violence with every molecule of my being from this day onward. Hopefully, this will have a similar effect on you. One final word, this material is absolutely not appropriate for children. The restaurant BUZZES. Emil checks his watch.</utterance>

Eddie and Emil both go for the gun. Eddie knocks him out of the way. Stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly. Leaves him in a ball on the floor. Oleg comes at Eddie and he knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa. The blinds and lamp shade are shot - bathing the room with more light. Emil stabs Eddie in the stomach.

   <speaker>JORDY</speaker>

   <speaker>JORDY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Jordy hangs up. Changes the channel. He stops as Robert Hawkins' face fills the screen. He is standing across from someone - in a park - interviewing him.</context>
      <utterance>Hello?  No!</utterance>

      <mode>ON T.V.</mode>
      <context>The ANGLE CUTS to Zwangendaba, the mugger, now dressed in a suit and tie. Clean shaven and with a fresh haircut. He stands in the same spot where Jordy handcuffed him to the tree. He's appearing on "Top Story".</context>
      <utterance>He robbed you?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZWANGENDABA</speaker>
      <mode>ON T.V.</mode>
      <context>The phone RINGS again. Jordy suddenly pulls the phone off the table and throws it through the window:</context>
      <utterance>That's right, I encountered him right here. I was just askin' for change an' he whips out his big gun an' pushes me up against that tree, whereupon he takes my money and handcuffs me to it, leavin' me there all exposed...</utterance>

   <speaker>JORDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jordy exits the cab. The anger rising inside his body is coming to a boiling point. He walks into the park. Leon is sitting on a bench. Just sitting there. Also filled with rage and frustration. Jordy meets his eyes. Leon gets up and walks away. Disgusted by it all. Jordy's right hand grips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on.</context>

      <context>Jordy walks alongside the moving mass. His eyes focused on Emil - his hand in his pocket. We notice in the crowd Max, the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac. What's he doing here? Max's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket. A weird gleam in his eye. We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other cops. Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their place in the mass. She watches Emil with quiet rage. Cutler continues:</context>
      <utterance>...my client was suffering from a major illness of schizophrenic nature wherein during times of intense stress, as a result of paranoid and psychotic delusions - there was impairment of his ability to appreciate wrongfullness... This is a victory for the mentally ill!</utterance>
   <speaker>CUTLER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>They are through the monuments, approaching the steps when Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who's checking his watch obsessively.</context>
      <utterance>...before Emil boards the police boat and heads for Rykers Island where he will be checked into the psyche ward, I want to say one last word to you all... As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg Razgul into committing these murders, yet Oleg is still out in the street, a free man, filming gruesome murders... My client and I hope he is brought to justice in the near future.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAWKINS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jordy glares at Emil. Emil looks back at Jordy, gloating. Smiles. He won. He beat the system. Jordy suddenly erupts.</context>
      <utterance>Where the hell is he? Goddamn it?!</utterance>
   <speaker>JORDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Emil stares down Jordy. Jordy grips the gun inside the jacket.</context>

   <speaker>JORDY</speaker>

      <context>Jordy moves past the officer. Emil breaks away from Cutler. Gets in Jordy's face. Laughs quietly.</context>
      <utterance>And what about the other victims?? What about their families? He'll end up in some country club nuthouse while his lawyer sells his rights to the movies and we just stand here and do nothing? We let this scumbag walk?</utterance>
   <speaker>EMIL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jordy shoves Emil into Cutler. A scuffle breaks out as the cops separate the two - pulling Jordy back as we cut to:</context>
