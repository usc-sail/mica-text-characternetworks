      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hardly. I analyze everything to death. Every time a guy smiles at me, I ask myself is he really smiling or is he just orally fixated? When I smile back, I wonder, am I really attracted or just smiling out of some residual Cro-Magnon instinct?

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well... if you gave a new toothbrush and taught dental hygiene to every student at your school... In the long run you'd save them thousands of dollars. I mean look at the cost of dental bills. I bet I could have put my kids through college with what I've spent on fillings.</utterance>

      <utterance>It is, isn't it?  Maybe you should try the toothbrushes. You might do a lot for education by saving teeth.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Huh. I never thought of that.  I tell you what. Tell Bob we'll take the order and see how it goes.</utterance>
