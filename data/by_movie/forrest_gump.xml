   <speaker>DOCTOR</speaker>

      <context>The doctor sets Forrest down on its feet. Forrest walks around stiffly. Forrest's mother, MRS. GUMP, watches him as he clanks around the room awkwardly.</context>
      <utterance>All right, Forrest, you can open your eyes now. Let's take a little walk around.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOCTOR</speaker>

      <utterance>She said we was related to him in some way. And, what he did was, he started up this club called the Ku Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in their robes and their bedsheets and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something. They'd even put bedsheets on their horses and ride around. And anyway, that's how I got my name. Forrest Gump.</utterance>

      <context>Forrest stops suddenly as his brace gets stuck. Forrest's brace is caught in a gutter grate. Mrs. Gump bends down and tries to free Forrest. Two old cronies sit in front of a barber shop and watch.</context>
      <utterance>Momma said that the Forrest part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well, just don't make no sense.</utterance>

      <context>Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the sidewalk past the two old men. Mrs. Gump holds tightly onto Forrest's hand.</context>
      <utterance>Oooh. All right. What are you all staring at? Haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. GUMP</speaker>

      <context>Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the Gump Boarding House driveway.</context>
      <utterance>We lived about a quarter mile of Route 17, about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama. That's in the county of Greenbow. Our house had been in Momma's family since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come across the ocean about a thousand years ago. Something like that.</utterance>

      <utterance>Since it was just me and Momma and we had all these empty rooms, Momma decided to let those rooms out. Mostly to people passing through. Like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, place like that. That's how me and Mommy got money. Mommy was a real smart lady.</utterance>

      <utterance>What does normal mean, anyway? He might be a bit on the slow side, but my boy Forrest is going to get the same opportunities as everyone else.
