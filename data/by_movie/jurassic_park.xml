      <context>DR. ELLIE SATTLER, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs like a gazelle across the arid land. Exuberant, she leaves a trail of dust behind her. She zips by A STUDENT guarding the cordoned area. He tries to stop her.</context>
      <utterance>It tells me that this bone connects to the navicula which we already found articulating to the cuboid. OFFSCREEN, a woman SHOUTS to him. ELLIE  Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant! Grant looks up.</utterance>
   <speaker>STUDENT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dr. Grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues.</context>

      <context>Uncertain students. Ellie arrives and immediately gets into it.</context>
      <utterance>So, what can we stay for sure? Stress fractures in the heel ...</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Grant turns around to her and smiles. She's got it. Other students to - they knew is all along.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>No answer. Ellie gives it a try.</context>
      <utterance>Right as rain, Ellie. Now, why did she jump?</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A defensive posture against a vicious, blood-thirsty T-Rex?</utterance>
   <speaker>GRANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ellie jumps up.</context>
      <utterance>Perhaps. Or maybe to select the smaller, more tender leaves in the higher branches with which to suckle her young?</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Students laugh. One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie.</context>
      <utterance>I bet is was a mating ritual.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The science of paleontology can't answer these questions. Novelists and artists who dream a vision of the Jurassic period can attempt these questions with their imaginations. What we scientists can say is considering the mass and kinetic articulation of these bones, this animal had a vertical leap of about twelve feet. Not as entertaining as fiction, but absolutely fact without prejudice. Ellie intrudes again.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She points. On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a dusty wake. Grant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually as Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags.</context>
      <utterance>Excuse me, Dr. Grant. But ... fact is, we're late. There's the car.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Grant and Ellie continue walking. She interrupts his continued barrage.</context>
      <utterance>Jim, you keep making up the plaster batches. Whatever ratio you're using, it's perfect. Nora, no digging after five - when the temperature drops, those bones are just too brittle. Bill, I don't want any tourists walking over my raptor - I don't care if the Governor of Montana is with them, just you guys.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Grant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes.</context>
      <utterance>You know, if ev ery scientist stuck to his method like you, there would be no body of theory - no quasars, no big bang -</utterance>
   <speaker>GRANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ellie is gentle. She's telling him something they've discussed before.</context>
      <utterance>Jesus, a limousine. We're re-entering Hammond's world, that's for sure.  Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie.</utterance>

   <speaker>ELLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>- because Gennaro is paying us sixty thousand dollars to observe some resort of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's -</utterance>
   <speaker>GRANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Then, half-kidding with Ellie:</context>
      <utterance>- enough money to keep us free of commercial affiliations for two summers. All right, all right. Good.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>She laughs. But he can't quite leave. He grabs a computer printout</context>
      <utterance>Financial independence for fraternizing with the enemy?  I'll do it.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Skip turns the printout right-side up in Grant's hand. Grant smiles.</context>

      <context>He tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth. This is DENNIS NEDRY, a 40 year old computer programmer. He's fat, with greasy hair and a permanently wrinkled suit. His slovenly looks are wildly out of place on the rich leather sofa where he reclin es. Across a gleaming granite coffee table is BILL BAKER, businessman. A smooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's sloppy appearance and voracious consumption of food and drink. Nedry finishes a coke. Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view.</context>
      <utterance>Five hundred thousand is peanuts!</utterance>
   <speaker>NEDRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nedry holds the can of coke upside-down, drains the last drops.</context>
      <utterance>I'm not reneging. I'm re-evaluating.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEDRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table. One after the other, he throws them in the air. He gulps down two, misses one. It skids across the glossy floor. Baker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at Nedry.</context>
      <utterance>You think I'm a scumbag, I know.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEDRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and CHOMPS and SPEAKS.</context>
      <utterance>Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic industrial espionage, and you're bound to run across a scumbag or two. Guaranteed! Part of the job description. Look, who's to say, who is the real scumbag? After all, I know what you guys need so bad. I've heard of reverse engineering.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEDRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nedry starts the LAUGH as he EATS and TALKS.</context>
      <utterance>Let the other guy put in all the work, all the R and D. You take the finished product, work backwards, breaking it down to reveal its genetic code. Presto! In a few measly months you have know-how that took researchers ten years to determine. You know how much Hammond has invested of his own personal wealth? Over five billion dollars! And if you guys get the jump on his - in no time, the market's wide-open.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEDRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>S explosively. He begins to choke, COUGHING and GASPING. Baker is repulsed. He stares out the window as the sun sets. Nedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat. He clumsily runs toward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes. Nedry grabs Baker's hand and squeezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help. Baker coolly shakes his hand loose and shoves Nedry to the floor. Baker looks down at the prone and desperate Nedry.</context>
      <utterance>But, boy, he's really got his product! Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money- making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that product. It is a sight! Yes, indeedy! Nedry LAUGH</utterance>
   <speaker>BAKER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bakers kneels down next to Nedry, who is beginning to turn blue.</context>
      <utterance>Scumbag. We have a deal. That deal is not open to renegotiation. Or even re- evaluation.</utterance>
   <speaker>BAKER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Baker glances at his watch.</context>
      <utterance>The deal stands. Take it or leave it.</utterance>
   <speaker>BAKER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head. Baker nods back and SLAMS his fist into Nedry's solar plexus. It works. Nedry sucks in a huge gulp of air. He sits up , rubbing his belly. As Baker leaves the room:</context>
      <utterance>I'll give you a few minutes to decide.</utterance>
   <speaker>BAKER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>CAMERA LEAVES NEDRY and exits the window. IT SWISHPANS the concrete canyons of Wall Street and enters another office.</context>

   <speaker>GRANT</speaker>

      <utterance>There's bad wind shear on this peak.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>No answer. Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through the mist. Some are very close. Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion.</context>

   <speaker>ELLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Grant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet. He sees the giant glowing fluorescent cross below. Lights FLASH at corners of the cross.</context>
      <utterance>This is not fun.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The copter suddenly SHAKES violently. Ellie grabs Grant's hand. Gennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut.</context>
      <utterance>Relax, Ellie. I'm sure they wouldn't land if it weren't safe.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Another violent shake. Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back. CLOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a packet of crackers. Gennaro is soaked. He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened. He speaks a mantra.</context>
      <utterance>Gennaro? This guy knows what he's doing, Right? Hey, Gennaro? I'm talking to you!</utterance>
   <speaker>GENNARO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>No problem. Relax, relax.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRANT AND ELLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>CLOSE ON - the pilot jerks back the stick. THE COPTER zooms upward. Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours across the floor. Nedry's lunch does flying. Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang suspended in the air. Now it all FREE-FALLS onto Nedry's lap. Grant and Ellie lean tightly into each other,</context>
      <utterance>Whoa!!!!</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest. Trees are close, then far, then close. The helicopter drops rapidly. Ellie and Grant shut their eyes. They brace themselves for the worst. IN AND OUT OF THE MIST, the copter descends. Tail raised high, nose low, fo r a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric animal bucking in its pen. In a flash, it corrects itself. The copter touches down on a heli-pad. The SOUND of the rotors fades and dies. For a second, no one moves. Grant lets out a great sigh of relief. Gennaro mouths a silent prayer. The pilot stretches his fingers. Grant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other. Nedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap. He turns:</context>

      <context>Nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door. A smile comes across Gennaro's face. As he smiles he motions with his hands he doesn't mean any harm. Grant and Ellie stare at him.</context>

Led by Grant, the passengers rise through the open top of their Land Cruisers, to look up at the dinosaurs far above. DROOPING FROM ABOVE, leaves and little branches shower on Grant.

      <context>The goat is tethered in the middle of the fi eld, thirty yards from the nearest tree. Grant scans the tree for the T-Rex. The goat senses something too. It struggles and strains, bleating frantically. Suddenly the mechanical SOUND of the cage coming up. Its bars surround the goat with safety once again.</context>

They back up but they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment. But if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car. Grant slings Lex onto his back. She grabs her hands around his neck and digs her feet into his sides. Grant begins to climb over the downed fence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop! Grant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of the embankment. Just in time as the Rex SHOVES the cruiser further. Now, the cruiser TEETERS right on the edge, turning again on its side. Tim hangs halfway out of the car, unable to get out further. Grant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the embankment. ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge. Lex looks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly. Grant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above. He pushes off the wall and swings them toward the next hanging cable. He reaches out and - - GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as - - the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove. Timmy and the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE. Timmy SCREAMS! Grant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them. Lex SCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter! They watch helplessly as the cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree at the base of the wall. Grant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree. Timmy can't be seen. Grant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers.</context>

      <context>He loops the winch around the tractor's base. Suddenly, he stops and looks around as he hears a gentle HOOTING. He squints, looking at the strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli ghts. HOOT! HOOT! A distinctive HOOTING. Nedry looks up in fear. SILENCE. Nedry starts moving toward his jeep. Again, the HOOT! Nedry stops, looks right, looks left. A RUSTLE in the trees. Nedry's head cocks. Looking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a SPITTER in the eerie mist. Now it's gone. Now it's back. It circles Nedry warily, hunting him. Nedry stares.</context>

Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the driver's door. The Spitter stalks, watching him. Nedry pulls open the jeep door, thrusts his head in, slams it against the door frame. Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep. The Spitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it closes it on Nedry. Nedry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patiently turns his blind eyes that way. A long beat. The Spitter leaps forward, the CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDER AND WIDER. Nedry lets out an ear-splitting SCREAM and the car horn BLARES.</context>

Grant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser again. He motions for Timmy to hold still. Grant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door handle. This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door. Grant gingerly holds it half-open in mid-air.</context>

He lets himself down. Now he si ts on a branch, a few feet below the cruiser. CRACK! The cruiser drops. Grant still hangs onto the door but now his footing on the branch is gone. His legs hang in space. The cruiser hangs precariously above Timmy. They're all twenty feet in the air.</context>

      <context>Timmy lets go and DROPS. Grant follows. So does the cruiser. It's hurtling right at them. Timmy BANGS against the wet tree-trunk and slides down. Branches WHIP against his face, his hands SCRAPE against the trunk. Grant BOUNCES them. They scramble down as quick as they can. Timmy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree. CRACK! Grant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, he flips himself over, dropping further. The cruiser jolts along, just a half-step behind them. Timmy dives the last six feet and HITS the wet earth with a THUD! Grant CRASHES next to him. Before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser keeps coming. Grant and Timmy look up at it. GRANT'S POV - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them. And finally stops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked headlight glaring. Oil drips down on Grant. He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles. The two roll away. That second the cruiser SMASHES to the ground. Grant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy. Timmy slowly reaches up and pulls himself standing.</context>

      <context>Frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the maelstrom. The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust. GRANT AND LEX AND TIMMY run wildly. The stampede is very close behind Grant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust. Another deafening ROAR of the T-Rex. Grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers. The animals continue to close. CLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals. The ground VIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet. GRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks. They frantically tuck in between big boulders as the the herd reaches them. Lex shields her dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks. Grant pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks. GRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass. Another slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood. Stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl ying in the air. Above, even the birds are running. Disoriented, they fly frantically along. GRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust. Just shadows of huge bodies with giant limbs. BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle. A boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy. He dives out of his rocky hiding place. The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex. They dive after Timmy. The group buries itself anew in a group of thick roots tangled amidst smaller rocks. The boulder continues on, SMASHING the rocky enclave they have just left. Grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate above them. The stampede goes past. They lie there, unable to move. They watch the herd trample on. CLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor. Lex SCREAMS. Grant and Timmy cover her mouth. The T-Rex hunts down the herd. He targets his prey. A young hadrosaur. As the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges fiercely. The Rex and its victim are enveloped in dust. Grant holds Lex close. She watches the terrible cloud with a quiet horror. Timmy makes the first move to leave.</context>

Muldoon follows. Wu is just five feet away from the door to the generator building. CLOSE ON - Wu's tense face. THE ATTACK is sudden and fierce. It comes from the brush. The raptor leaps onto Wu in an instant. Wu and the raptor roll on the ground. Wu struggles for his life. Muldoon can't get a safe shot. He SCREAM:</context>
      <utterance>Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every moment. But this shell carries quite a punch, so if you're too close, it'll take a piece of you. Ellie's on the headset with you. If another ones come at you, let her know. Then Ellie - you start jumping and yelling. The buggers are easily distracted. They'll come running and let Wu get that power on. Then both of you, get behind this fence as quick as possible.</utterance>

Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate. He slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on. Ellie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as she goes. The gate is almost closed. The raptor lunges. Muldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with all his might. The raptor shudders, caught in the gate. Stunned, for a second, it doesn't move. Ellie and Muldoon run to the building. They push open the steel-clad security door and dive inside. Wu limping, chases after them. With a curse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu.

      <utterance>Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful place. I need a man just like you to help me get my park back on its feet again. And it will be on its feet again.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Grant is unimpressed. He holds a hand out to Hammond. Hammond tries a new approach.</context>
      <utterance>Oh you don't know. There are wonderful plans in the works, sites already purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic Japan.</utterance>

      <utterance>Don't you see I've exalted human potential here? You must see it. You must feel it. I called back a life form. Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go. Be a part of this. I'm inviting you to do just that - let the others go, if they want.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRANT</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You interrupted natural law. There are regulations, rules that nature follows that make her knowable.</utterance>
   <speaker>HAMMOND</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You mean there are rules that nature follows that create barriers to our knowledge.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Barriers? Like the seasons? The earth spinning, orbiting the sun? The entire solar system in interlocking motion. Our own beings in biological step with it all. Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the pattern and look what it's done!</utterance>
   <speaker>HAMMOND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know what it's done. I've made triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex. I've got a batch of iguanadons being born on Tuesday. What do you say to that?</utterance>

   <speaker>GRANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You created mutant forms that you further mutated to create amus ement attractions. You made biological puppets with heartbeats and an early death sentence.</utterance>

      <context>Grant grabs Hammond's arm, starts to tug.</context>
      <utterance>The merchandise is just a by-product. Souvenirs for people to reflect on the wonder. You fainted when you saw the brachiosaur. Alan, look, let's not argue. The problem is that my employees were not up to par with my dream. They failed me. The park, I promise you, is safe. It really is.</utterance>

      <context>Hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as the ROTORS START UP. Hammond's suit whips in the wind. Grant calls to him, reaching out his arm.</context>
      <utterance>It is not! It's blooming! In the throes of labor! You are one more more negative voice in a universe of negativity. You'll amount to nothing. You'll be a bone-brusher all your life. I pity you.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hammond keeps walking. He disappears over a grassy knoll. Grant's outstretched hand drops to his side when THE ATTACK comes. With a huge bellow, the T-Rex comes charging at the helicopter. THE PILOT screams for all to board as he starts to lift off. The Rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape. The copter angles dangerously as the Rex holds on. Ellie fires a fire-extinguisher into the furious face of the Rex and its jaws relax. The copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky. The Rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter a final swipe with its tail. The tail SWISHES through the air and CRACKS against the plexiglass windshield which fissures and pops. The pilot struggles to maintain altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air. With a ROAR of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars. away, leaving an angry T-Rex alone. Unnoticed by the frustrated Rex, Hammond slips away and walks into the jungle.</context>
