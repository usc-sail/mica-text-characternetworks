      <context>The child subsides, breathing steady. Eyes closed. The mother rises. Regards her through the dimness. Slowly turns, heads for the door. Flicks on a Winnie the Pooh NIGHTLIGHT -- Her entire right forearm is slicked with blood. More blood on her Czech-made MP-5 machine gun. She staggers just a little... barely noticeable. Passes out on the light. Into darkness. Sits beside her daughter's bed. The child sleeps peacefully. Outside snow slithers at the glass. FADE OUT. Pause. Blackness.</context>
      <utterance>Close your eyes now. I love you.</utterance>

Stands at the shoulder of the highway, full view of the parking lot... Adopts a two-fisted stance. Draws a bead, locks on target -- Leaves his feet. Takes to the air as a BLACK LE SABRE swerves off the highway with no advance warning and DEMOLISHES the bastard, wham--! The car roars across the lot, NATHAN WINDEMAN at the wheel.</context>

Hits a dead stop. Hood shears off, goes flying. Back end sticking up, tires spinning... The horn blares continuously. UP ABOVE: The other cop arrives, brakes to a halt -- Door opens and out he comes. Helps Deputy 2 clamber from his crippled black-and-white. Together they leap down into the gulley, guns drawn. Cringing as the long HOOOOOOOONNNNNK continues unabated. Approaching the crashed car. Walking up, guns at their sides... TWO SHOTS. They jitter and twitch. Topple over dead, slide to the bottom of the gulley. INSIDE THE CAR, we see that a very annoyed Timothy is also very conscious. Splayed against the driver's side door. Holding one hand down on the horn, HOOOOOOOONNK... He releases it. Horn stops. On the radio Conway Twitty is singing. He puts a shot through the radio. Silences it. Climbs from the car and stares off down the road. Of Nathan and his companions, there is neither whisper nor breath...</context>

   <speaker>CHARLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She heaves a sigh. Threads a silencer on a baretta.</context>
      <utterance>At the end... there she was, this pretty little girl at the bottom of the ocean, smiling at me. Three years old, didn't know Daddies hid in closets, not yet. Stared up at me in the strangest way... saying how'd it come to this, we were so pretty and perfect, now look at us, sinking with our head all open... Said when she grew up she was gonna teach school. She couldn't wait.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLY</speaker>

      <utterance>Guards are on 27-1 megahertz, meet me at 26-9, you need to talk. As soon as you spot me with the kid, start blowing the charges.</utterance>

In and out of the trees... BURYING C-4 CHARGES. In bushes. In snowdrifts. She crawls to woods' edge, peers out -- The motel stands solemn and bedraggled. Draws a sharp breath -- !

      <context>Pause. Suddenly Charly's eyes go wide. She whispers:</context>
      <utterance>Budget cuts, remember? Congress blinded us in Eastern Europe, Central America. Across the board, an intelligence blackout. We had to recruit any eyes and ears we could find, even if it meant going to former targets.</utterance>

      <utterance>Theory, my ass. I think some terrorists were planning a strike. Bought supplies from Daedalus, that's how you knew they were coming...  No way. Don't tell me you're gonna sit there and let them go through with it, just to get a budget increase .</utterance>
   <speaker>PERKINS</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's not without precedent. 1993, remember the World Trade Center bombing...? The CIA had advance knowledge, don't think they didn't. Worse, the diplomat who issued the terrorist's visa was CIA, they facilitated the bombing. Purely to justify a budget increase. Of course, they'd no way of knowing the terrorists would botch the job.</utterance>
