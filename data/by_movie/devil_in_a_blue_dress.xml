      <context>The fifty-year-old burly bartender leans over his big stomach checking for cracks and buffing the veiny marble top of the bar with a filthy rag. Behind him is a yellow billboard from 1932 with big black letters reading "Fuller vs. Shag. 10 ROUND MAIN EVENT." We could make out more of the poster and the eight-by-ten framed boxing photos around it if it wasn't so smoky in the place.</context>

      <context>His words hang as his eyes stray toward the door. Easy looks up also at THE DOORWAY which fills with the large frame of the white MAN in an off-white linen suit, his pale eyes surveying the room. Satisfied that all but two of the six tables in the tiny room are unoccupied, he smiles at Joppy and walks to the far end of the bar. Easy is surprised to see Joppy, tough ex-heavyweight that he is, duck his head and smile as he makes his way over like he's answering a summons. The white man extends a friendly hand and the two of them shake like old friends and lean in close to talk in private. Easy finds it hard not to watch their conversation as he takes a sip from a short glass of bourbon on the rocks. After a moment...</context>

      <utterance>I didn't say that... But if there's a dollar laying in the street I don't think he'll let a little dirt stop him from picking it up.

Albright is holding a glowing red poker that Shariff, standing in front of the fireplace, has just handed him. Easy starts blasting. KABLAAM! Manny takes one to the throat. KABLAAM! Albright and Shariff lunge for cover, and Daphne ducks down behind the back of the sofa, screaming and screaming. Manny, hand to his throat, pulls his gun on reflex, firing into the floor and then half runs, half staggers out the side door just ahead of another KABLAAM! that digs out a chunk of the wall. Easy hears the screen door open and then ducks down, getting ready for Manny who should be coming his way from the side door. He HEARS more steps stumble out and then... SILENCE. And then, KABLAAM! BLAAM! Two huge blasts rip right through the wall next to Easy's head, and he scrambles to the side of the house, underneath another window with the shade pulled down.</context>
