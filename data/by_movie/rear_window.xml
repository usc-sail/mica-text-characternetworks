      <mode></mode>
      <context>As she comes down the stairs of the landing, holding on the wrought iron railing with one hand:</context>
      <utterance>Hello Stella.</utterance>
   <speaker>STELLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She puts her bag down on a table. It is worn, and looks as if it belongs more to a fighter than a nurse. She takes off her hat coat, and hangs them on a chair.</context>
      <utterance>And there aren't any windows in the workhouse.</utterance>
   <speaker>STELLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He doesn't answer. She opens the bag, takes out some medical supplies: a thermometer, a stop watch, a bottle of rubbing oil, a can of powder, a towel. She talks as she works.</context>
      <utterance>Years ago, they used to put out your eyes with a hot poker. Is one of those bikini bombshells you always watch worth a hot poker?</utterance>
   <speaker>STELLA</speaker>

      <context>A look at his face shows he doesn't think much of it.</context>
      <utterance>We've grown to be a race of peeping Toms. What people should do is stand outside their own houses and look in once in a while.  What do you think of that for homespun philosophy?</utterance>

   <speaker>STELLA</speaker>

      <context>She takes the thermometer out of its case, shakes it down. Looks at it. Satisfied, she walks to Jeff. She swings the wheelchair around abruptly to face her.</context>

   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>STELLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As she leaves him holding the thermometer THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as she crosses to a divan. She takes a sheet from underneath, and covers the divan with it. Talking, all the time.</context>

      <context>THE CAMERA PANS HER over to him. She takes out the thermometer, looks at it.</context>
      <utterance>I can smell trouble right in this apartment. You broke your leg. You look out the window. You see things you shouldn't. Trouble. I can see you now, in front of the judge, flanked by lawyers in blue double- breasted suits. You're pleading, "Judge, it was only innocent fun. I love my neighbors like a father." -- The Judge answers, "Congratulations. You just gave birth to three years in Dannemora."</utterance>

      <context>She gets down the thermometer. Sterilizes it with a piece of alcohol-soaked cotton in her other hand. She gets behind the wheelchair the CAMERA PULLS back as she pushes it over to the divan. She puts the thermometer away in its case. Then she helps him off with his pajama top. She helps him stand on one foot. He hops one step, then she lowers him, face down, on the divan. She gets a bottle of rubbing oil.</context>

Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.</utterance>

      <context>She gives a low. Warm laugh, and the CAMERA PULLS BACK to show that Lisa has been bending over Jeff's wheelchair from the side. As she straightens up, it PANS her swiftly over to the corner of the room, keeping her in big closeup. She turns on a low, hanging light. We see her full facial beauty for the first time. It is a warm, intelligent face.</context>

      <context>She does. He takes out his own professional corkscrew, quickly inserts it and levers the cork out. He deftly wraps the napkin around the bottle and pours the wine, replacing the bottle in the wine bucket. Lisa has opened her purse to produce some money, in bills. She hands it to the waiter.</context>

      <context>Carl goes up the stairs and out the door, while THE CAMERA REMAINS on Lisa and Jeff. She picks up both glasses of wine and walks toward Jeff. She seats herself on the windowsill as she hands him his glass. We notice that the outside is considerably darker by now, and the lights are beginning to come on in the various apartments outside. They raise their glasses in a silent toast, and sip the wine. THE CAMERA CLOSES IN until they are both in a tight TOW SHOT.</context>

      <utterance>Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?</utterance>

      <context>Jeff's opinion of that is a short chuckle.</context>

      <context>The CAMERA PULLS BACK slightly as Stella emerges from the kitchen. She is carrying a tray with breakfast on it. Eggs, bacon, toast and coffee.</context>
      <utterance>Look, Doyle -- it's just one of those things I can't tell you on the phone. You have to be here, and see the whole set-up.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stella squeezes past the right side of Jeff, and places the food tray on a windowseat in front of him. She peers out cautiously toward Thorwald's apartment for a moment. Then she squeezes back, moving to the sideboard against which leans a small table on an adjustable stand.</context>
      <utterance>It's probably nothing important -- just a little neighborhood murder, that's all. As a matter of fact, I did say "murder".</utterance>

      <context>Stella returns with the table, and sets it up so that it is across Jeff's lap. She gets the tray of food pausing to look toward Thorwald's apartment. Then she places the breakfast on the tray table in front of Jeff. He has moved back a little to avoid getting the phone cable tangled in the food and dishes.</context>

      <utterance>Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.</utterance>

      <utterance>You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.</utterance>

   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>

      <context>He picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the street intersection, as Lisa moves back to him.</context>

   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The CAMERA PULLS BACK as Lisa starts around the apartment turning on the lights. As she light increases, we see that she is wearing another extravagantly beautiful dress. She seems quite animated, moving gracefully, her skirt and hair swinging with her movement. Jeff turns around to face the room.</context>
      <utterance>He must have gone somewhere to the right.</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thinking about Thorwald?</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As he talks, she seems to be thinking something over to herself. He starts pacing, trying to distill her thoughts. We see that she has brought an oversized handbag with her, which lies prominently on the table. Jeff watches her.</context>
      <utterance>Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Something on your mind, Lisa?</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It doesn't make sense to me.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What doesn't?</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Women aren't that unpredictable.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>THE CAMERA CLOSES IN, Lisa stops, faces him. Her eyes sparkle, and her body is tense with concentration.</context>
      <utterance>Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>THE CAMERA eases back.</context>
      <utterance>Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Inside stuff?</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's what the witnesses told him.</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Still -- those witnesses.</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She comes over to Jeff. He reaches up, takes her hand.</context>
      <utterance>We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He pulls her into his lap. She puts her arms around him. She is very happy, and kisses Jeff's cheek.</context>
      <utterance>Come here.</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>We have all -- what?</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Night. I'm going to stay with you.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She cuts him off with a kiss. When she pulls back</context>
      <utterance>You'll have to clear that through my landlord --</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have the whole weekend off.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lisa smothers him with another kiss. She lets up.</context>
      <utterance>Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She smothers him with still another kiss. Then moves back.</context>
      <utterance>Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She laughs, gets up. Goes to the large handbag on the table. Is is a Mark Cross ladies 'attache' case.</context>
      <utterance>-- pajamas.</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?</utterance>

      <utterance>I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She gets up from Jeff's lap, and puts the overnight case on the table. Open. She goes to the window, and looks toward the song-writers' apartment. Jeff turns with her.</context>
      <utterance>There's that song again.</utterance>

   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>From his landlord -- once a month.</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>

      <utterance>It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.</utterance>

      <utterance>You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.</utterance>

      <utterance>I do?</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She sits down on the edge of the divan near Jeff. She leans toward him.</context>
      <utterance>Staying the night here, uninvited.</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.</utterance>

      <utterance>The same.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She goes to the kitchen, humming with the song-writer's melody which we can HER off. Jeff turns back to the window, looks out.</context>
      <utterance>Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.</utterance>

      <context>Jeff's tension eases off a little, by he is eager to talk.</context>

   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.</utterance>

      <utterance>You think he's getting out of here?</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Doyle looks back toward Thorwald's bedroom. We see the dark apartment beyond him. Doyle nods thoughtfully. He turns his head suddenly at the sound of Lisa coming out of the kitchen. She holds two large brandy snifters containing some brandy. They are cupped in her hand, the stem between her fingers. She is rotating them gently toward the body to warm the brandy. She is quite beautiful.</context>
      <utterance>Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She comes forward hands one snifter to Jeff. She offers the second to Doyle. (NOTE: In the following set of scenes, whenever anyone holds a brandy snifter, it is being rotated- regardless of their attitudes.)</context>
      <utterance>I'm just warming some brandy.</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Doyle sort of smiles, and takes the snifter awkwardly.</context>
      <utterance>Mr. Doyle? -- I presume.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Doyle bows his head slightly, but his eyes remain on her in a fixed stare.</context>
      <utterance>Tom, this is Miss Lisa Fremont.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lisa smiles in return.</context>
      <utterance>How do you do?</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She turns around, and goes right back into the kitchen.</context>
      <utterance>We think Thorwald's guilty.</utterance>

   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He listens, and then looks up to Doyle.</context>
      <utterance>Hallo?</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Doyle crosses and stands behind Jeff, as Jeff hands him the Phone. He juggles the cigarette, the brandy snifter and the phone all at once. This is all done deadpan.</context>
      <utterance>Just a minute, please.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Uh-huh. -- Yeah. Mummmm -- Mmm. Hmm -- Okay. Thank you, and goodbye. He hands the receiver back to Jeff, who hangs up. Lisa comes back in with her own brandy snifter, rotating it.</context>
      <utterance>Doyle speaking.</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Doyle looks suddenly interested. He asks tersely:</context>
      <utterance>The coffee will be ready soon.  Jeff, aren't you going to tell him about the jewelry?</utterance>
   <speaker>DOYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Jewelry?</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He turns his head to Lisa, who answers.</context>
      <utterance>You sure it belongs to his wife?</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His head snaps back to Jeff, who answers:</context>
      <utterance>Namely?</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?</utterance>
   <speaker>DOYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His head moves back to Lisa as she answers with a touch of pride in her voice.</context>
      <utterance>You figured that out, huh?</utterance>
   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Before Doyle can comment, Jeff asks impatiently:</context>
      <utterance>It's just that women don't leave jewelry behind when they go on a trip.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Doyle smiles at Jeff, and then strolls over to the table where he puts out his cigarette and puts down the brandy snifter.</context>
      <utterance>Come on, Tom -- you don't really need any of this information, do you?</utterance>
   <speaker>DOYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Doyle goes to the window and looks out, as they watch him, expectantly. He speaks without looking at them. His voice is flat and to the point.</context>
      <utterance>As a matter of fact, I don't.</utterance>
