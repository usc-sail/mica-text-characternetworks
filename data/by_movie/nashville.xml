      <mode></mode>
      <context>She looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some glasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every time someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through the song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks away from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished his meal.</context>
      <utterance>I'm good, though. There ain't but one Sueleen Gay -- I don't mean to be conceited, but really it's true. I've been taking special coaching lessons from Zeke Willard -- he's just wonderful. Teaches you how to phrase; that's really important. And breathing. Well, you know all about that. Anyway, I wrote this song.</utterance>
