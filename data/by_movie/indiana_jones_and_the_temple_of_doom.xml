      <utterance>You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Indiana takes a seat across the table from Shanghai's notorious crime-lord. Lao is fifty, wealthy enough to now display some fat, but still muscular from his fight to the top of the garbage heap.</context>
      <utterance>I don't like to show off.</utterance>
   <speaker>LAO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Indiana looks at the pile of caviar on the plate in front of him -- and stubs his cigarette out in it. The cigarette sizzles and Lao's smiles dies with it. There's applause as Wille Scott finishes her song. At the table, Lao stares at Indiana with a strange intensity.</context>
      <utterance>For this special occasion, I ordered champagne and caviar.</utterance>
   <speaker>LAO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So, it is true, Dr. Jones? you found Nurhachi?</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Indiana looks across the table at Lao's son, CHEN, who resembles a bulldog and snarls like one now. INDIANA (Cont'd) It was dark, but I think one of your sons tried to get Nurhachi without paying for him. Indy stares pointedly at Chen's recently bandaged hand. Chen mutters and stands angrily -- Lao barks a command in Chinese and Chen sits down again.</context>
      <utterance>Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.</utterance>
   <speaker>LAO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You have insulted my son.</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.</utterance>
   <speaker>LAO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lao pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket and puts it on the table. Indiana glances at it.</context>
      <utterance>Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Now a pretty hand slips onto Lao's shoulder and he looks up to see Willie Scott. Lao kisses her hand. Willie is unaware of the explosive mood at the table and she smiles flirtaciously at Indi- ana.</context>
      <utterance>As I recall the deal was consid- erably more.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Aren't you going to introduce us?</utterance>
   <speaker>LAO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And this is Indiana Jones, the famous archaeologist. Willie sits down between Lao and Indy. She takes out a small mirror to check her make-up. LAO (Cont'd) Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me and is about to deliver him -- now. Lao nods across the table and Indy sees KAO KAN, Lao's second son, open his coat and remove a silver-plated pistol. Indiana looks worried. Willie doesn't notice as she fixes her make-up and coyly teases Indiana.</context>
      <utterance>This is Willie Scott.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She looks down terrified at the knife Indy is poking against her ribs. WILLE (Cont'd) I was only kidding, can't you take a joke -- ? (to Lao) Lao, he's got a knife!</context>
      <utterance>Well -- I thought archaeologists were always funny little men searching for their mummies --  Aaahhh!</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Kao Kan glances at his father. Lao finally nods to his son and he slips the pistol back into his pocket.</context>
      <utterance>Put the gun away, sonny.</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The ritzy patrons at the tables nearby are unaware of the tawdry drama quietly unfolding at this table. Willie eyes the blade and whimpers. She looks imploringly at Lao and he slowly reaches into his pocket. He puts ten gold coins next to the cash on the table. Indy leans forward to look at the gold coins -- so intently that he fails to notice Kao Kan spilling some powder into Indy's cham- pagne glass!</context>
      <utterance>Now I suggest you pay me what you promised -- or your girlfriend here is going to be squealing a new tune.</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The knife pokes Willie and she whimpers again. Lao reaches into another pocket and brings out a folded piece of rice paper -- he opens it and a large diamond and ruby spill out onto the table. INDIANA (Cont'd) Bingo...you see, Lao, with a but of persuasion, even you can be an honest fellow. Indy smiles and jabs the knife into the middle of the table. Then he lifts his champagne glass in a toast to Lao -- who watches expectantly as Indiana moves the glass toward his lips -- Suddenly Willie stands angrily, jostling Indy's arm so that he doesn't drink his champagne.</context>
      <utterance>Try again Lao -- the deal was more.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lao sees Indy put his champagne glass down and he snarls at Wil- lie --</context>
      <utterance>Look at this! He put a hole in my dress from Paris!</utterance>
   <speaker>LAO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Willie quickly obeys. Lao forces a smile at Indy and lifts his glass to seal the deal -- LAO (Cont'd) To your health, Dr. Jones. Lao sips hs champagne and watches hopefully as Indy picks up his glass and this time Indy does drink the champagne. Then he reaches for the cash -- But Chen grins and puts a silver snuff bottle next to the cash, gold and jewels -- he tips the little bottle over and some white powder spills out of it --</context>
      <utterance>Sit down!</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's that?</utterance>
   <speaker>LAO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Indiana examines his champagne glass and sees a residue at the bottom of it. He swallows and feels sick, wondering it it's fear or the poison already taking effect. LAO (Cont'd) There is an antidote for this poison. You give me Nurhachi -- I give you the antidote. Indiana is sweating. Willie looks at him and sees Indy's hand shaking. LAO (Cont'd) The poison works fast, Dr. Jones. Where is Nurhachi? Indiana finally reaches into his pocket. Next to the cash, gold, jewels and poison, Indiana sets down a beautiful small box. Lao and his men stare hypnotically at the exquisite gold and enamel box.</context>
      <utterance>A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nobody pays any attention to her as Lao reaches for the box.</context>
      <utterance>This Nurhachi's a very small guy.</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lao opens the box carefully and stares reverently at the grey powder inside. INDIANA (Cont'd) Now what about the antidote, Lao.</context>
      <utterance>Inside are the remains of Nur- hachi -- the first Emperor of the Manchu Dynasty.</utterance>
   <speaker>LAO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Qillie grabs Lao's arm and some of the precious ashes spill out of the gold box. Stunned by this desecration of his ancestor, Lao grabs Willie by the wrist and twists her arm --</context>
      <utterance>So, what's the big deal? Let me see it --</utterance>
   <speaker>LAO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You fool!</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ow, you're hurting me, you miser- able little hood!</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lao just laughs evilly -- until a waiter moves up behind Lao and the crimelord suddenly stiffens. He lets go of Willie's wrist and raises his hands off the table. Chen stops collecting the money and jewels. Kao Kan tenses and Indy smiles at Wu Han, the Chinese waiter with the scar, who is standing behind Lao. Wu Han has a towel over his hand -- under it, he has a pistol pressed against Lao's spine. INDIANA (Cont'd) (smiling at Wu Han) I like the service here.</context>
      <utterance>Let go of her, Lao. And give me the antidote.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, he's not a waiter...</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lao carefully reaches into his pocket and puts a small glass vial of liquid next to the cash, gold, jewels, poison and sacred box. Indy looks relieved as he reaches for the vial of antidote -- then he hears a muffled report! And another! Wu Han groans and sways. Indy starts to stand but Chen immedi- ately turns the smoking pistol with the silencer that he used to kill Wu Han -- Indy sees it pointed at him now and he remains in his seat. Kao Kan stands and grabs Wu Han, easing the phoney waiter into the chair he just vacated. The muffled shooting hasn't attracted any attention. The nightclub activity continues an Indy speaks emotionally to his dying friend.</context>
      <utterance>No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along.  So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao.</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>In pain, Wu Han looks at Indy and struggles to speak --</context>
      <utterance>Wu Han -- listen to me -- I'm going to get you out of here.</utterance>
   <speaker>WU HAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wu Han dies and slumps forward. Indiana is shattered by the death of his old friend.</context>
      <utterance>Not this time, my friend...  I followed you on many adventures -- but into the great Unknown Mystery, I go first, Indy...</utterance>
   <speaker>LAO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Indy's gaze shifts from his dead friend to Lao's sneering face. Then Indy sees the murderous Chen giggling perversely. Indy's anger is compounded by the poison burning in his gut and his vis- ion of Chen's ugly face blurs into a double image -- Indy stands up unsteadily. Chen assumes he's about to keel over from the poison -- but Indy suddenly turns and grabs a real wai- ter at another table. The waiter holds a long skewer of roasted pigeons that he's just set afire -- Indy grabs the skewer of pigeons flambee and hurls is across the table! Chen fires and misses -- and screams as the skewer stabs into his chest and the burning pigeons flame in front of his hor- rified face! This the other tables definitely notice. There are screams and all hell breaks loose. Indiana shoves past Willie and reaches for the vial on the table --</context>
      <utterance>Don't be sad, Dr. Jones -- you will soon join him.</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But he's grabbed from behind by Kao Kan. Indy elbows the punk, reaches back and grabs his head -- and somersaults Kao Kan onto the table! As nubmer two son crashes into the table, the impact sends the Emperor Nurhachi's ashes billowing into Lao's stricken face! Indiana yells as he sees the vial of antidote rolling across the table -- and falling! Indiana dives and catches the antidote just before it hits the floor -- then Indy's hand is brutally stomped on by one of Lao's henchmen and the vial rolls away. Indiana angrily raises his head, smashing it up into the hench- man's groin -- the man howls like a banshee and hobbles away.</context>
      <utterance>The antidote -- !</utterance>

      <utterance>Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Gunfire explodes and they both scramble in different directions. Indy dives through the fleeing nightclub patrons and slides be- hind a water-spewing fountain. Water kicks up as Indy is shot at by Lao and his henchmen. Indy sees the vial of antidote kicked again and it spins across the marble floor -- feeling the poison, Indy shakes his head groddily and splashes water on his face. Meanwhile, Willie is chasing her diamond, shoving through the panicked crowd. She spots the diamond! Another elegantly dresses soman is bending to pick it up --</context>
      <utterance>Who cares? Where's that diamond!</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Searching desperately for the jewel, Willie sees the vial of antidote spinning across the floor --as it slides by, she grabs it.</context>
      <utterance>Aw nuts!</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>She sees Indy speeding by atop the serving cart. Lao and his gunmen rush out to block the way. Indy rolls off the cart and slides behind a potted palm as Lao's men open fire again. INDIANA (Cont'd) (shouting to Willie) Hey, don't go away! I need that! Willie smiles meanly as she slips the vial down the front of her dress, thumbs her nose at Indiana and walks away. INDIANA (Cont'd) If I wasn't dying, I'd kill her... Hiding behind the palm tree, Indiana looks around and spots a gi- ant statue at the side of the stage. Indy makes a break for it. As the gunmen open fire, Indy springs onto a chair -- jumps onto a table -- and leaps onto the stage. He grabs the golden broad- sword from the Chinese warrior statue! As bullets smash into the statue, Indiana hides behind it. Then he jumps out and swings the large sword toward the enormous brass gong. The crimson cord holding the gong is SLASHED! Indy slings the sword at his assailants and gives the three-meter-high gong a helpful shove -- The giant gong rolls and echoes as it crashes down the marble steps. Indiana ducks behind it as it gains momentum and rolls across the dance floor. Using the gong as an enormous shield, Indy evades the gunfire ex- ploding -- bullets ricochet off the rolling brass gong as Indy runs behind it. Ahead, Willie hurries toward an exit -- she hears something and turns -- her eyes go wide as she sees the mammoth gong bearing down on her! Willie yells as Indiana grabs her arm and pulls her behind the gong with him -- Lao watches amazed as he and his gunmen dodge tables trying to get better firing positions -- and more henchmen come into the club now and start firing machine guns! As bullets clang against the gong, Indiana and Willie run behind it. Willie hollers as they head directly for a towering, floor- to-ceiling window! Indiana grabs Willie around the waist and, after the huge gong crashes through the stained-glass window, they both fly after it!</context>
      <utterance>Hey,doll! Don't move!</utterance>

      <context>Indy grabs his shoulder bag and pulls a pistol out of it. He pokes the gun through the broken window and starts firing back at their pursuers -- then he turns and looks ahead. INDIANA (Cont'd) There, Shorty! Through the tunnel! Through the windows we see the car racing into a tunnel. Lights from the pursuing cars flash through the rear window and gunfire echoes in the tunnel.</context>

      <context>Indiana watches her lie down and wrap herself in her blanket. then he rolls over and tips his hat down over his eyes to get some well-deserved shut-eye. In a moment, however, we see something grotesque and snake-like slide into frame and move towards Indy -- finally, we realize it's an elephant's trunk. The trunk nudges Indy's shoulder.</context>
      <utterance>Just try and control yourself.</utterance>

   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Now, we see that Short Round is guiding the baby elephant's trunk with a prod. Willie watches, stifling a laugh as the elephant's trunk sniffs Indiana's ear -- INDIANA (Cont'd) You're going to start something I'm going to have to finish. (moaning) Okay, doll, you asked for it. Indiana rolls over, lifts his hat and hollers! He nearly jumps out of his pants as he stares into the elephant's trunk. Willie and Short Round dissolve into laughter.</context>

      <context>Short Round avoids the dinner by feeding it to his little monkey as he listens to the scary conversation. The talk is bad enough, but Willie finds the food unbelievable! A servant leans overher shoulder and places a six-inch long BUG on her plate! Willie whimpers quietly as she watches the fat merchant next to her lift one of the black, shiny baked-beetles -- and crack it in two! The man proceeds to enthusiastically suck the gooey innards out.</context>
      <utterance>Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The Brit- ish Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.</utterance>

( Production note: be- cause of his extremely sensitive nature, the director has reque- ted that these monkey heads be simulated). The tops of the monkey's skulls have been cut off and sit loose like little covers. Willie watches in utter dismay as the Maha- rajah and his guests remove the skull-tops and start dipping spoons into what's inside -- MERCHANT (Cont'd) Chilled monkey brains!

      <context>While Short Round watches angrily, Indiana walks across the gar- den and unfurls the whip. Indy sees a servant lighting a candle. Suddenly the whip flies and CRACKS like a pistol shot. The candle disappears! Indiana whirls and CRACKS the whip again, snagging a flower out of a dancing girl's hair. The Maharajah reacts like any kid -- he shoops happily.</context>

   <speaker>MAHARAJAH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Short Round sulks as he listens to Indiana instructing the Maha- rajah on how to hold the whip. As the young prince practises the grip, Indy notices Chattar Lal slip behind a fountain to talk to a dark figure in robes who appears. Indiana sees Chattar Lal bow to the dark figure -- and Indy catches a glimpse of the stranger's pale face and dark hollow eyes. Then the robled apparition seems to disappear. Meanwhile everyone watches respectfully as the Maharajah unfurls the whip for his first attempt. He flings the whip but it flies back and snaps -- biting his own cheek. There's a stunned silence -- then Short Round laughs at the little prince who is holding his wounded cheek. The incensed Ma- rahajah suddenly flashes the whip as Short Round. Short Round grabs the end of it and pulls hard -- the whip is tugged taut between the two hostile boys. As they draw near each other, Short Round sees something weird: The little Maharajah's eyes begin glowing yelloe and he hisses softly in a strange voice. Nobody else sees or hears the bizarre transformation... Indiana finally intercedes -- he grabs Short Round by the neck.</context>
      <utterance>That is wonderful! Please teach me how!</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Short Round lets go and Indy gently takes the whip back from the little prince. INDIANA (Cont'd) The Turks say that a whip can be an enemy even to its owner. If you get some rope, it'll be easier to learn with, your Highness. Now, I think we'll say goodnight. The Maharajah and Short Round stare hostiley at each other as Indy recoils his whip.</context>

As the guards turn Indy face down, they rip off his jacket and chain his ahnds to the rock. The Maharajah uncurls the whip -- he notices Short Round smiling snidely -- Suddenly the Maharajah cracks the whip -- it lashes out and cuts into Short Round's shoulder. Blood appears and Short Round looks stunned by the lash and by the fact the Marahajah knows who to use the whip. MAHARAJAH (Cont'd) As Dr. Jones suggested, I have been practicing. The little Maharajah whirls and lashes the whip again. Indiana jerks as the bullwhip rips through his shirt and tears open his flesh. The Maharajah lashes again and again -- blood spurts across Indy's tattered shirt. As the whipping continues- Short Round jumps as if he is also be- ing beaten. His eyes fill with tears as he watches Indy suffer. Finally, the little Maharajah lets the whip fall limp.

Indiana springs into action, stopping another priest with a quick punch in the stomach. Then he rushes over to the crankwheel and pulley platform. Indy jumps onto it, yanking one priest off who spills onto the floor. A second priest, who works the controls lowering the sacrificial frame, sees Indy and releases the crankwheel -- Down in the crevasse, Willie screams as the iron frame suddenly plummets toward the fulminating lava! On the platform, the priest lunges at Indiana -- Indy uses the man's own momentum to throw him over his head. Indy then dives for the crankwheel and manages to stop it -- Down in the crevasse, the fram jolts to a stop only yards above the spumes of fiery lava.

      <context>Indiana suddenly punches the giant in the stomach -- the giant does not flinch, he just belches rudely. Indiana growls and winds up to take a killer swing -- he steps back, cocks his arm -- and suddenly turns and runs away. No dummy, Indy dashes over and picks up a piece of wood. The giant starts toward him. Indy drops the wood and looks around for a much larger piece of wood. As the giant stalks toward him, Indiana raises the large piece of lumber -- Indy suddenly groans, drops the wood and clutches his stomach. Willie and Short Round looks startled --</context>

      <context>Short Round shakes his head. They see Indy recover from the spasm as the giant rushes him. Indy jumps aside, landing on a loaded mine car that is passing by. The car is being dragged up the dump ramp and the giant jumps out onto it after Indiana. Indy quickly grabs a rock and, as the giant rushes him, Indy smashes the rock against the big man's skull! Unfortunately, it's the rock that shatters and not the skull. Indy dives to the other end of the mine car and lifts a large boulder. Suddenly Indy drops the boulder and grabs him arm, feeling a shooting pain again. Then he yells as he feels yet another stab- bing pain in his left leg.</context>

      <context>Shorty is convused and worried -- and then he sees something! He looks up and there on a rock-cut balcony over the cavern is the little Maharajah! The little prince clutches the clay krtya doll that represents Indy. He jabs it in the leg with a long sapphire-tipped turban pin. On the mine car, Indy yells and grabs his right leg, which collapses beneath him. Short Round takes off. He dashes under the platform toward a bucket-chain carrying spent water back up to the cistern. Short Round leaps over the pool of water and grabs onto a bucket. He rises up on this make-shift elevator toward the rock balcony and the malicious little Maharajah. Meanwhile, Indy is on the brink of unconsciousness as the giant's massive hands throttle his neck. Indy's head hangs over the end of the mine car and suddenly his eyes widen -- The car with Indy and the giant reaches the peak of the dump ramp and its upended -- spilling both of them and a shower of rocks down the conveyor belt! Down below, Willie dodges wooden pillars and weaves around quarry equipment, trying to follow Indy's battle with the giant. She trips and swears angrily -- Willie pushes and empty mine car out of her way -- an empty mine car!

On te conveyor, Indiana gets to his feet and then yells as a stabbing pain lacerates his back! He falls and writhed helpless- ly as the giant staggers up the rocky conveyor belt toward him. Willie shoves the mine car forward. She sees Indy's desperate situation as he's pulled along the conveyor toward the rock crusher!</context>

The little Maharajah's eyes glow fiendishly as he lifts the clay doll -- and jabs the pin into the doll's face. On the conveyor belt, Indy yells agonizingly and clutches his stabbed face! Behind him, rocks explode as they're crushed and pulverized by the mammoth roller. In front of Indy, the Thuggee giant grabs a pick-axe as the con- veyor slides past a tool bin. The giant approaches Indy with it. Short Round dashes across the balcny and tackles the Maharajah. They fall and fight like mortal enemies. Short Round sees the little Maharajah's eyes glowing as he punches him in the face. Only a few feet away from the rock-smashing roller, Indy is still on his back on the conveyor belt, thrashing in pain, feeling the Maharajah's pin piercing his face. The giant raises the pick-axe above his head and it about to split Indiana in two! On the balcony, the Maharajah drops the doll and Short Round dives for it -- he grabs the clay doll and pulls out the pin! On the conveyor belt, Indiana is suddenly released from the and looks up to see the giant swinging the pick-axe. Indy rolls aside at the last minute! The pick-axe cleaves into the conveyor belt and the giant lurches forward -- Indy gives him a helpful kick, sending the giant flying toward the rock-crusher as Indy jumps off the conveyor belt! Seeing the huge roller looming in front of him, the giant crawls desperately against the movement of the conveyor belt -- but he gets snagged! The sash around his waist gets caught under the rolling cursher and he's dragged back under it feet first. The Thuggee giant screams hideously as his body is rolled over and squashed by the enormous stone wheel! On the balcony, Short Round is jabbing the pin into the squirming little Maharajah. The little pricne's eyes still glow yellow as he hollers --</context>

Short Round notices the yellow glow dying out of the Maharajah's eyes -- just as Indy's eyes cleared after he was released from Kali's trance.</context>

      <context>Meanwhile, Indy runs along the catwalk above the conveyor belt. He jumps and grabs onto a cross-bard -- he kicks out with his feet and knocks a quarry guard off the catwalk. The guard flies through the air and topples into the sand pit where he thrashes around blindly under the sand falling from the crusher. Across the cavern, Willie shoves the rolling mine car toward the balcony.</context>

      <context>Willie starts pushing the empty mine car with Short Round. SHORT ROUND (Cont'd) You do pretty good for a girl! Across the quarry, Mola Ram and six temple guards run out onto a high platform next to the waterfall. Mola Ram sees Willie and Short Round pushing the mine cat. Mola Ram shouts to his men -- two of them pull pistols and open fire! Bullets ricochet off the mine car and Short Round shoves Willie to the far side of the car where they both take cover. Meanwhile, up on a catwalk, a guard slices a sword through the air and Indiana ducks! The sword slashes into a wooden railing and the guard tries frantically to pull it out -- Indiana slams kis knee up into the guard's stomach and then smashes his fist down on his neck -- the man collapses. Indy hears more gunfire. Indiana rushes along the catwalk toward the platform above. He edges against the wall below the platform, staying out of sight as he unfurls his whip. One of Mola Ram's guards fires again from the high platform and Indiana lashes the whip -- the whip wraps around the gunman's arm and Indy yanks on it -- The gunman topples through the air and crashes down onto the cat- walk. Indy grabs the gun. He kicks the guard off the catwalk and the man falls into the waterfall pool. As the other guards fire down at him, Indiana dodges along the catwalk and fires back at them. A bullet explodes near Mola Ram and he ducks back -- Meanwhile, Short Round and Willie have the mine car rolling and they jump into it --</context>

Bullets whiz past as Indiana sails in the air above the speeding mine car - when they are in sync, Indy lets go and drops into the mine car next to Willie and Short Round!

      <context>In the speeding mine car, Indy sees the tracks separating in two directions -- one back into the quarry, the other toward two tun- nels that lead out of the mines. Indiana lifts a shovel from the floor of the car and swings it just in time -- he hits a switch which CLANGS as they speed by and the car is shunted tipsy-turvy onto the track toward the two tunnels.

The car bounces off the tracks and flies through the air into a siding where is CRASHES against a stone wall in an EXPLOSION of rock and metal! Pieces of debris pommel the drive of the second Thuggee car and he quickly grabs for the brake to slow down and avoid the same fate!

      <context>All three of them groan as they raise the boulder and shove it off the back of the car -- ducking instantly to avoid being de- capitated by the next beam! Looking back, they see the gunmen pop up between the beams -- and they see the looks of terror on the gunmen's faces as they see the boulder in front of them! The Thuggee car hits the boulder and upends! The guards scream horribly as the car tumbles end over end, slamming against the tunnel walls, getting ripped to shreds so that finally only pieces of metal, wheels and debris fly like a meteorite shower down the tunnel!

      <context>Indy sees Short Round holding up the broken brake lever! Indy crawls quickly toward Shorty while Willie holds on for dear life! Completely out of control, the car hurtles down a decline into a section where the tunnel if larger again -- Indiana bends over the front of the car and looks underneath.

      <context>Willie looks terrified but helps Short Round grab onto Indy's arm and the back of his jacket. He skips over the front of the car and swings a leg underneath -- Indy is inches above the rails and the rocky ground blurring be- neath the car as he tries to kick at the brake-pad. His feet fall and he bumps along, dragged dangerously for a moment -- Indy manages to find a foothold on the undercarriage of the car. As they hold onto him, Indy kicks again and his foot hits the brake-pad. He shoves it and slowly the pad closes against the spinning wheel...</context>

      <context>He looks around -- and sees the car rocketing directly toward the stone wall! Indy's foot starts kicking in high-gear underneath the car -- he slams at the brake-pad with all his strength -- the pad screeches against the spinning wheeel and starts sparking! The car seems to slow as it shoots toward the end of the tunnel. Indy groans and pushes hard against the smoking brake-pad. The car slows more and more until it runs down the last few yards to the dead-end and rolls gently to a stop, just nudgeing Indy's back against the wall....</context>

      <context>Indiana sees that the tunnel ahead continues without any more tracks. Then they hear something -- A strange rumbling sound echoing down the tunnel from behind them. The walls seem to reverberate. Looking worried, they start walking away down the tunnel.

   <speaker>SHORT ROUND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly the board under him breaks! Willie grabs Short Round before he falls into the abyss! Looking pale and less cocky, Short Round starts out again and Willie follows his carefully. They continue stepping across the bridge cautiously, a feat made more difficult by the bridge's constant swaying and the hear- stopping up and down movement. Behind them, Indy finally pulls himself up from under the bridge. He stands up and sees Willie and Short Round halfway across already. Then he hears something and turns quickly -- he takes his whip out and ducks to the side of the tunnel as two Thuggee guards rush out. Indy cracks the whip, catching the first guard around the neck -- the guard spills forward and trips the second guard. The first man tries to stand but Indiana kicks him in the head. The second guard gets to his feet and seings his sword -- Indy ducks, slams him in the stomach and dives for the first guard's sword. He grabs it and rolls aside quickly as the second gaurd attempts to slice him in two! Indy gets to his feet and immediately finds himself about to en- gage in a sword duel with the enraged Thuggee guard. Indy looks at the unfamiliar sword, hefts it, and tries to quickly decide the best way to use it -- Suddenly the guard shouts and charges. Indy decides shouting must be the "de rigueur" technique and shouts back loudly -- the two swords CLANG and spark as the duel erupts. Indy flails and feints and the Thuggee guard lunges and slashes. Indy finally gains the upper hand and dispatches the Thuggee guard who slumps defeated into the dirt. Keeping the sword, Indy starts out onto the bridge, walking as quickly as possible across the rickety span. He hears shouting ahead and looks worried then temple guards appear at the far end of the bridge. The guards suprise Willie and Shorty as they finally get across the bridge. Struggling futilely with the guards, Willie shouts at Indiana --</context>
      <utterance>Easy like pie! Kid's stuff!</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Indy sees more Thuggee guards rushing out of the tunnel behind him. He turns and sees two of the tmeple guards who captured Willie and Short Round coming across the bridge in front of him. Indy stands helpless in the middle of the swaying bridge with guards approaching from both sides, and nothing but heaven above and the rocky gorge hundreds of feet below! A wind comes up and the High Priest, Mola Ram, appears on the far end of the bridge. He stands with the guards who hold Willie and Short Round. The wind whips around Indy and he staggers unsteadily on the swaying bridge as he watches Mola Ram --</context>
      <utterance>Indy -- looks out behind you!</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mola Ram shouts in Hindi and the guards start to move toward Indy from both sides of the bridge. INDIANA (Cont'd) That's far enough!</context>
      <utterance>Let my friends go!</utterance>
   <speaker>MOLA RAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Indiana indicates the bag over his shoulder --</context>
      <utterance>You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.</utterance>
   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mola Ram motions and the guards move farther out on both sides of the bridge -- suddenly Indiana swings the sword and it cuts into one of the bottom rope-spans! The rope is half-severed and frays slowly under the tension!</context>
      <utterance>You want the stones, let them go and call off your guards!</utterance>
   <speaker>MOLA RAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mola Ram motions again the his guards (looking more nervous now) step farther out onto the bridge, mvoing closer to Indy from both sides. Indy swings the sword again, cutting into the other rope-span! It, too, is now partially severed and frays slowly. The bridge jolts and Indy and the guards sway precariously! Suddenly Mola Ram shoves Short Round out onto the bridge. The High Priest draws a dagger and pushes Willie onto the swaying span, holding the knife behind them both. MOLA RAM (Cont'd) Your friends will die with you! In different times this would be called a Mexican stand-off Indiana looks at the guards in front and behind him. He sees Willie and Short Round out on the bridge now with Mola Ram at their backs.</context>
      <utterance>Impressive, Dr. Jones. But I don't believe you would kill yourself!</utterance>

      <context>Indy and Short Round's eyes meet -- and the kid realizes that his hero isn't kidding. Willie looks at Shout Round anxiously -- she notices that Shorty is surreptitiously wrapping his foot around a rope support. Petrified, Willie also secretly wraps her foot around a rope and does likewise with her arm --</context>
      <utterance>Then I guess we're all going to take a big dive!</utterance>

   <speaker>INDIANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Indiana swings the sword with all his might -- it whooshes through the air and slashes clear through the top and bottom ropes --! Immediately Mola Ram's guards start to flee in panic -- too late! Indiana swings the sword again and the two ropes on the other side are severed -- The rope bridge is sheared in two! It breaks in the middle and both halves fall apart! The guards scream horribly in the air as they plunge down into the rocky gorge! Willie and Short Round cling to their established footholds and fall with the bridge toward the wall of the gorge. Mola Ram spills forward, clutching desperately at the ropes and slats -- Below them, Indiana has latched onto a rope and swings with the bridge as it hits the gorge wall and hangs vertically now, dang- ling from its moorings at the top. There's an instant of suspended animation as all who remain alive realize they are alive. Short Round and Willie cling near the top of the now vertical bridge. Below them, Mola Ram clutches onto one of the main ropes while directly above him the last of his guards holds on for dear life. Short Round and Willie struggle upwards, clutching ropes and stepping on slats. Finally, Short Round heaves himself up onto solid ground and turns to help Willie up. Meanwhile, dangling below on the bridge, Indy reaches up and grabs Mola Ram's leg. The High Priest kicks and tries to break Indy's grip. He kicks again and smashes Indy in the face. Indy won't let go. Suddenly the High Priest reaches up and grabs his own Thuggee guard and yanks his down by the front of his shirt -- Mola Ram shoves the luckless guard down onto Indy, trying to dislodge him by sacrificing the screaming Thuggee. Indy manages to hang on. The Thuggee is less fortunate and falls screaming to his death. Then Mola Ram looks across the gorge and yells. Indy sees a dozen of the last Thuggee guards streaming out of the tunnel -- only to be stranded on the far side of the now bridgeless gorge. Indy starts climbing up after Mola Ram again. He grabs at the back of Mola Ram's robe and pull him down. Slipping, Mola Ram turns and it's Indy's chance to punch Mola Ram in the face. Mola Ram's eyes are glowing yellow and he's shouting incoherent- ly. He grabs the strap of Indy's shoulder bag and stamps on In- dy's hand -- Indy falls! Indiana slips downward, scrambling to catch hols of something -- meanwhile, Mola Ram now has the bag with the Sankara Stones. Indy finally stops his downward slide and dangles dangerously near the bottom of the bridge. Across the gorge, the Thuggee guards run up a path to a small gove of trees growing on a plateau above the gorge. The guards have bows and arrows and take firing positions -- At the top of the bridge, Mola Ram keeps climbing until rocks start poundinghim from above -- Willie and Short Round pely him with rocks which he tries to block with his arm. Indiana starts to climb again, using all his strength. He reaches for a wooden slat -- suddenly a flaming arrow smashes into the wood! Indy turns in amazement and sees more flaming arrows rocketing across the chasm directy for him! Across the gorge, by the grove of trees, a Thuggee priest yells orders to the archers who continue to launch the flaming arrows. Indiana crawls up as the bridge starts to burn from the continu- ing bursts of fiery arrows. At the top, Mola Ram reaches up des- perately for a hand old -- Willie smashes his hand with a rock! The High Priest yells in pain and slips down to where Indy slugs him again in the face! They struggle as the fire burns up from beneath them. On the cliff above the fallen bridge, Willie watches the fire rising toward Indy and Mola Ram as they fight. Short Round turns and sees something --</context>
      <utterance>Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!</utterance>
   <speaker>SHORT ROUND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They see horses galloping through a narrow pass -- the British cavalry is returning. Captain Blumburtt and the first troops draw up their forses and dismount quickly. A fussilade of flaming arrows force the British to take cover -- they quickly start firing back at the Thuggees with rifles. As the battle above the gorge continues, Indy and Mola Ram fight below on the dangling bridge -- Indiana sees the High Priest's eyes begin glowing and he hisses insanely. Mola Ram's hand thrusts out toward Indiana's chest and Indy yells in pain -- Indy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees Mola Ram's hand starting to enter his chest (as it entered the victim's chest during the temple sacrifice)! Mola Ram's finger are inching into Indy's body -- Indy clutches at Mola Ram's piercing hand, trying to keep the deadly fingers away from his heart. Slowly, Indy is able to push Mola Ram's hand away and his fingers withdraw from Indy's chest. Indiana suddenly slugs the High Priest in the face and grabs for the bag of Sankara Stones --</context>

      <context>As Indy pronounces the magical words, the bag begins glowing and starts to burn Mola Ram as he clutches it -- the stones begin to spill out of the bag and the High Priest grabs from them. INDIANA (Cont'd) (He repeats Sankara's warning in Sanskrit) The blazing stones sear Mola Ram's flesh and he screams in pain. The light suddenly dies in his eyes and for one instant he looks at Indy as if awakened from a nightmare -- Mola Ram loses his balance and Indy grabs for the stones. He manages to clutch only one of them as Mola Ram screams and falls! Indy sees the stone in his hand suddenly cool. He watches Mola Ram plummeting downward into the chasm and finally crashing into the jagged rocks at the bottom. The irritated crocodiles are disturbed once more -- but soon wel- come the meal that just dropped in. Jaws flash and teeth rip at the High Priest's likeless corpse. And Indy's bag with the Sankara Stones sinks into the murkly cur- rent and disappears down the river ...</context>
