   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nick opens a cabinet under the sink and tosses the empty bottle in the trash. He begins to pace. Carol shuts the cabinet and follows him with her gaze. As Nick speaks, he gestures grandly with his drink, liquor splashing unnoticed over the sides.</context>

      <utterance>Fourteen hours.</utterance>

      <utterance>In a car? It's a fuckin' nightmare.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And there's no radio in Utah. It's all religious programs.</utterance>

      <utterance>No thanks.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAROL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey. Think about this. You take a detour and go through Vegas -- you and Beth stop, see a show, have a nice romantic dinner -- play the slots, get the free drinks...</utterance>
   <speaker>CAROL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nick and Carol collapse into laughter. The front door opens.</context>
      <utterance>No, you skip the hotel. It's night, the highway's empty -- you can make good time. You start speeding. You get stopped in Utah by the cops -- you flunk the breathalizer, they haul you in. The judge is Mormon -- you get fifteen years, you go to prison, but at least your life has taken a direction!</utterance>
   <speaker>BETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Beth steps in. Carol quickly lets go of Nick's neck and gets off him.</context>
      <utterance>I'm here!</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK AND CAROL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There's an awkward instant followed by too much cheerfulness.</context>
      <utterance>Embarrassed, they both smile self-consciously.</utterance>

      <utterance>Okay.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You agreed to try Billings.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know.  Billings, Montana. City of the future.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She smiles and shakes her head.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah and I read that a while ago -- so the future's probably already there.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's not like you're leaving anything behind. A good job or something.</utterance>
   <speaker>BETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He puts his arms around her waist from behind, and nestles her against his body.</context>
      <utterance>Just some friends.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You'll make new friends.</utterance>
   <speaker>BETH</speaker>

      <utterance>I know.  I'm not eight years old. I know I'll make new friends.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She pulls away from him and starts walking to the house next door. He falls into step with her.</context>
      <utterance>Then what is it?</utterance>
   <speaker>BETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I, umm... I... It embarrasses me. When you talk about something with Carol that happened before me. She's my best friend. It embarrasses me that you used to live with her.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That was years ago.</utterance>

      <context>They arrive at their front door. Beth takes out her keys. Nick stops her hand and kisses her. She kisses him back.</context>
      <utterance>And we're moving. She won't be your best friend anymore.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She nods and looks to the lock.</context>
      <utterance>Living with someone isn't such a big deal.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>

      <utterance>Shit.  I hate this shit! It never kept the coffee hot. And now this.</utterance>

      <utterance>Okay.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I could've gotten a new one. On my discount. Now it's too late.</utterance>

      <utterance>Do you want a donut?</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nick pushes a button on the blender. It makes a horrible GRINDING WHINE. He unplugs it.</context>
      <utterance>This coffee maker was junk.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He jams the blender into the trash.</context>
      <utterance>This blender's junk. Our t.v. is junk!</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>She wanted to meet someone new. I asked her "why?" -- she said, "Because he won't know me from before. Just now. Just what I am now." Beth looks to him, puzzled.</utterance>
   <speaker>SID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He holds Beth tightly.</context>
      <utterance>I knew her... on playgrounds... in Sunday School... all those grades -- I knew her as she changed. But she was still the same person. All the times I knew her, she was still her.  She can't get away from that.</utterance>

      <utterance>You stay in one place, and all those things that are you... are there. She didn't understand that if you leave, they're still there, in you -- but they stop being clear. You stop knowing who you are, and what you want.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, I'll tell you my number, but there's a problem. My phone's been disconnected, not because of bills, I mean we paid all our bills. We were hardly ever even late. We were very good customers, but we're moving, so we had the phone disconnected. But now I need to call... the woman I live with. She's still there and I've got to let her know where I am.</utterance>

No. No. No. You see you have to be able to help me, this is not a prank, it's my home phone, this is an emergency.  Yes it can, it can be done. Someone there can hook the phone back up. It's not like a phone guy came to our house to disconnect the phone, nobody came to our house, someone just flipped a switch somewhere, somewhere there where you work, or plugged something into a computer and our phone stopped working!  They turned it off, they can turn it back on!  I know it's the week-end! I know! Call them at home! They'll have a computer at their house, they'll have a phone thing to hook it up to the real computer! That's how these people live! They'll be glad to do it!...</utterance>

It could be too late! Janet!! You've gotta help me! Please! You can reconnect me. Please!! Don't hang up! Don't hang up!!</utterance>

      <utterance>It seems I'm blessed... in what I do. I do wrong, and it turns out right... that I've done right. So it really doesn't matter what I do.</utterance>

      <utterance>That's very wise, but not very true.  I sell televisions. People don't know what they want. You have to show them.</utterance>

   <speaker>MAN'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A MAN and a WOMAN, both slightly portly Mexican-Americans in their late forties, wearing their Sunday best, step over the threshold and kiss. The man is carrying the woman cradled in his arms.</context>
