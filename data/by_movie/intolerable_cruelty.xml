      <utterance>The problem is that everyone is willing to compromise. That's the problem with the institution of marriage -- it's based on compromise. Even through its dissolution. One attorney will try to score some points, the opposition will try to impeach. The process will find an equilibrium point determined by the skill of the opposing lawyers, and then each party will walk away with their portion of the "goodies." Some say, "Life is compromise." But at Massey Myerson we believe life is struggle and the ultimate destruction of your opponent.</utterance>

      <utterance>All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>

      <utterance>He wants a reconciliation.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARYLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.</utterance>

      <utterance>Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair.

      <utterance>...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>What a touching story.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Miles flashes Marylin a "you are KIDDING" look, but she assiduously avoids eye contact.</context>
      <utterance>You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARYLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Miles acknowledges this with a curt nod.</context>
      <utterance>Howard and I are here, Miles, because I have learned through bitter experience that when it comes to matrimonial law, you are the very best.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARYLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You did good, Massey!</utterance>
   <speaker>MARYLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARYLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He gropes her. She giggles like a teenager.</context>
      <utterance>She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!</utterance>

   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOYLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.</utterance>

He's telling her about his day, and she is rapt with attention. The Massey's have a candlelit dinner of fish and pasta. The tulips are in the middle of the table. Miles and Marylin snuggle on a couch and watch Seinfeld. Miles in bed on the new Frette Linen. A few too many pillows, but he's making it work. Marylin enters the bedroom in a nightshirt that is the perfect combination of innocence and nastiness. He puts down his book as she gets into bed with him.

      <utterance>For the first time in my life, I stand before you naked... vulnerable... and in love. Love. A word matrimonial lawyers shy away from. Ironic isn't it -- that I have been frightened of this emotion which is, in a sense, the seed of my livelihood. But today, I am here to tell you: Love should cause us no fear. Love should cause us no shame. Love... is good.  Let me ask you a question. When our clients come to us confused, angry, hurting because their flame of love is fluttering and threatens to die -- should we seek to extinguish that flame, so that we can sift through the smoldering wreckage for our paltry reward? Or should we seek to fan this precious flame -- this most precious flame -- back to loving, roaring life?</utterance>

He takes her hand and they run toward the door, seeking egress. BANG -- still firing, he pulls out the inhaler but blindly bobbles it. Joe reaches with his gun hand to keep the inhaler from falling. He momentarily bobbles both gun and inhaler. Miles pops up in front of him.</context>
      <utterance>Twenty years in "matrimonial law" and it made me sick.  I broke up homes and families, never givin' it a second thought. Till one day. I had an epiphany. You know what that is?  Came with a damn stigmata if you can believe that! I said to myself -- Joe -- everyone you see wants blood. Everyone wants their ex's dead. So why jerk around with rest. You wanna best serve your clients? Kill em.</utterance>

      <utterance>Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARYLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Joe recovers and raises the gun to his mouth as he points the inhaler at Miles. He squeezes -- WHUSH -- Miles squints against the asthma mist and lets out a horrified:</context>
      <utterance>I'm not leaving you. I took self defense</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>BANG! The off-screen gunshot is followed by the sound of a body dropping heavily to the floor. Silence. Marylin runs over to Miles. They look sadly down at the floor.</context>
      <utterance>Joe!</utterance>

   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARYLIN</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's not something I wanted either.</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARYLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...</utterance>
   <speaker>RUTH</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now you both wait a minute. Nobody hired anyone to kill anyone.</utterance>
   <speaker>WRIGLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There is an uncomfortable shifting in seats. Wrigley looks at Miles.</context>
      <utterance>Hear, hear.</utterance>
   <speaker>WRIGLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Miles is still looking at Marylin.</context>
      <utterance>Apparently, from what I can gather, a burglar broke into your house -- became despondent over his lifestyle and shot himself.</utterance>

      <utterance>We've outlined a settlement... She pushes a piece of paper across the table.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Miles ignores the paper, which lies unclaimed on the middle of the table. He looks at Marylin.</context>
      <utterance>We think it's more than generous.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Marylin looks a Miles.</context>
      <utterance>My client is prepared to consider a reconciliation.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARYLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Miles, staring at Marylin, cuts in:</context>
      <utterance>How could I trust you, after... after all of this.</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You wounded me first, Marylin.</utterance>

   <speaker>MARYLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Miles, with his eyes still on Marylin, reaches into his suit coat. He withdraws a piece of paper, spreads it flat on the table in front of him and, still gazing at her:</context>
      <utterance>I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...</utterance>
   <speaker>MILES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He decisively clicks the button on a ballpoint pen, looks down at the paper in front of him and scribbles his name. He pushes the paper across the table toward Marylin. Gazing at him, seeking the truth in his eyes, she absently picks up the paper. There is a long silence. We hear only the hum of ventilation, and Wrigley's quiet snuffling. Ruth is looking down her nose through her glasses -- over Marylin's shoulder -- at the sheet of paper. Marylin however, looks only at Miles.</context>
      <utterance>You know... there's nothing in the Massey pre-nup that says it can't be executed after the parties wed.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's the Massey pre-nup -- Marylin rips the paper in half.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUTH</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>O-kay. I'm going back to the office Wrigley sobs openly.</utterance>

      <utterance>Come on Wrigley, I'll buy you a drink and an anti depressant.</utterance>

      <utterance>No one will ever love me that way.</utterance>
   <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He puts his knuckles on the tabletop and leans forward. Marylin rises slowly to her feet. She leans forward. They kiss.</context>
      <utterance>Not if you're lucky. No. Miles rises slowly to his feet.</utterance>
