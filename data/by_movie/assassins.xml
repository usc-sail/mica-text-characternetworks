   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He balances on one leg, holding his silk-socked foot in the air. He looks at the shoe, already filling with mud. He looks at Rath.</context>
      <utterance>Aw-shit!</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How much farther?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>About a half mile further into the thickening marsh there is a small cluster of trees.</context>
      <utterance>Just a little ways. Up to those trees.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He pulls his sock off and plunges his foot into the mud. He smiles. It feels good. He hurls the sock. Lifting his other foot he pulls his shoe off and hurls that. He grabs for the other sock, struggling to get it off, laughing at himself as he slips and falls into the mud. Rath waits, a faint smile. He manages to get the sock off and then stands digging both feet into the dark, wet earth.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, fuck it.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They move on, Ketcham almost playing, sinking his feet deep pulling them out to make a SPLURCHING, SUCKING NOISE.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, this feels kinda good.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, do you mind if I talk a little? I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sure.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that. 'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.' I never would though. Not really.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why not?</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He picks up a handful of mud and begins shaping it like a snowball.</context>
      <utterance>I don't know. Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?' I don't know. Maybe I didn't trust her.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He throws the mud ball at the grove of trees but they are too far.</context>
      <utterance>My Margaret... I loved her but you know what? I cheated on her. All the time. I don't even know why. It wasn't the sex, Margaret was great in bed. I think if I wasn't married I wouldn't have even looked at some of those women. I knew she couldn't trust me, so how could I trust her? If she was here right now I'd think that I would tell her that I was sorry... 'course, if she were here right now, maybe I wouldn't feel like talking.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I think I've heard of you.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's possible.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're pretty famous aren't you?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I hope not.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's a common question.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh yeah? I guess we still need to see that price tag. Like art, right? You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A dime.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jesus... Is that a lot?</context>
      <utterance>One hundred thousand? That's it?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Average.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ketcham laughs.</context>
      <utterance>Shit... oh well.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have been thinking about this for a long while. I knew this day was coming. I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked. What do you call it anyway?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Taken.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>'Taken.' That's nice. When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ketcham laughs again. He is getting kind of giggly, like he's high.</context>
      <utterance>That's exactly what I told myself.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Something occurs to him and he looks back at Rath.</context>
      <utterance>I always wondered what I'd be thinking at this exact moment. I imagined that I would be thinking about the fucker who contracted this, trying to figure out who it was...</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't know. That's how it works.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Right.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>It seems very funny to me.</context>
      <utterance>I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not. I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What are you thinking about?</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm thinking about Moonpies. Ain't that funny? I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He's 'laughing' and Rath laughs with him. Ketcham suddenly stops laughing. They are nearly to the cluster of trees.</context>
      <utterance>And an R.C.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Can I ask you something?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Go ahead.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He looks at the trees, his voice dying in the WIND.</context>
      <utterance>What do other guys do?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Some are ready, some are not.</context>
      <utterance>Everyone handles it differently.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Some.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying. It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay. I feel good.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Can I ask you a question?</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Anything.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why didn't you fade?</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You mean quit?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I used to think about it. I had Margaret. She wanted kids. I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe. I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part. 'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work. You understand?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ketcham smiles and looks around at the grove of birch trees.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He looks at the sun, bloody red seeping into the black horizon.</context>
      <utterance>I always pictured that I would end in some land fill, under someone else's garbage. I kept picturing those plastic diapers filled with some baby's green shit, covering me. But this is nice...</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Do you mind?</context>
      <utterance>Look at that. I haven't watched the sun set in a million years.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ketcham stares at the last of the light.</context>
      <utterance>No.</utterance>
   <speaker>KETCHAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>With his face hidden from Rath he begins to cry. Rath watches Ketcham staring at the setting sun. Rath looks down at the gun limply held in his hand. When the sun is gone, a red glow at the bottom of a dark- ening sky, we hear the GUN, SILENCED, ONCE, then the BODY FALLING INTO THE MUD. After a beat we hear TWO MORE</context>
      <utterance>Nice... real nice.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yes. Please come in.</utterance>

      <utterance>How can a beautiful man like you be shy?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She moves closer to him, the sexual confidence of her body radiating like heat.</context>

      <context>Rath is obviously uncomfortable.</context>

   <speaker>ESCORT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They move into the room, from a distance, as featureless as two shadows. She stands at the windows watching the snow-bubble of a city night.</context>
      <utterance>I'd love one. Whatever you're having.</utterance>
   <speaker>ESCORT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Beautiful.</utterance>
   <speaker>ESCORT</speaker>

   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She sits on the couch, her body language changing, as she becomes a listener.</context>
      <utterance>I called because I just want... I need to talk.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He sits on the other end of the couch, his words thickened by the alcohol.</context>
      <utterance>I've been thinking about my life, about things I have done... What I do for a living is in some ways similiar to what you do.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He takes out an envelope and puts it between them. She picks it up, glancing inside at a stack of hundred dollar bills.</context>
      <utterance>I know that everything has a price. I want you to understand that I'm willing to pay.</utterance>

   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?</utterance>
   <speaker>ESCORT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sometimes.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do you think about their wives or their families?</utterance>
   <speaker>ESCORT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Rath nods. His next question is barely audible.</context>
      <utterance>No. They call me, I don't call them. If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

      <utterance>All the time.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>For the first time we really see her take a drink. She closes her eyes.</context>
      <utterance>Can you tell me about it?</utterance>
   <speaker>ESCORT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She opens her eyes and looks at him.</context>
      <utterance>Sometimes I dream that I meet a man, this good, honest man and we fall in love. I imagine us living on a boat, reading books, sailing to places where no one knows who we were or cares what we did.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She smiles.</context>
      <utterance>And what if you never meet that man?</utterance>
   <speaker>ESCORT</speaker>

      <context>A FIFTH, SIXTH and SEVENTH SHOT. Leevio's body falls forward and softly thuds on the table. Bain whips around drawing a small SEMI-AUTOMATIC WEAPON from his belt expecting an attack. Facing the screaming crowd, he begins to SHOOT anyone who moves or stands, men or women. There is chaos in the restaurant. People scream, falling to the ground, scrambling under tables. Bain is sweating, his eyes shifting wildly from one end of the room to the other. The restaurant falls quiet except for several people who are sobbing.

      <context>Bain screams, throwing open the door and hurling himself out. Rath jams on the brakes, TIRES SCREAMING, steering into the steel side rail, banking the car into the drums of sand as -- Bain hits the pavement, bouncing like a stone skipped across water. A driver hits his brakes, swerving, just missing him. SAND EXPLODES from the impact and the cab bounces up over the median into the bus-only lanes as the driver's airbag balloons out of the steering wheel. Bain rolls and rolls, finally stopping sprawled out like a piece of roadkill. The cab careens up onto a curb, slamming into a pole, the radiator spitting out a cloud of WHISTLING STEAM. Several cars lock up and collide to avoid Bain; one car stopping inches from him. A woman jumps out, rushing to the front of the car, but Bain is gone. Police CARS ROAR up into the midst of the accident. One of them pulling alongside the demolished cab. The door is open, the airbag popped. Rath is gone.</context>

      <context>Electra is in a daze, her hand moving into her pocket.</context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry, this may sound really weird, but my friend told me he slipped a letter under the door here and I was wondering if you happened to see it?</utterance>
   <speaker>ELECTRA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Letter?</utterance>
   <speaker>JENNIFER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah. He said he saw a woman with dark hair going into the building when he dropped it off.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELECTRA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Electra's mouth opens and she backs away. Jennifer is bothered by her reaction and she doesn't push it.</context>
      <utterance>No. I don't have it.</utterance>
   <speaker>JENNIFER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She shrugs and unlocks the interior door, leaving Electra in the lobby. Electra watches her, as her hand moves from pocket to pocket. A worried expression tightens her face; the letter is gone. She opens the interior door, following Jennifer up the stairs.</context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to -- I'm sorry.</utterance>

      <context>Her face is as expressionless as Nikita's. He pours himself a very large bourbon and slugs it down. Takes a deep breath, then pours himself another one.</context>
      <utterance>Want a drink?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He returns to his table with his drink.</context>
      <utterance>Okay...</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm not good at this sort of thing, but we don't have a lot of time, so I'll just go ahead and get started. First: you. I ask myself, 'What is she thinking?' Her body tightens, coils.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Another deep pull on the bourbon.</context>
      <utterance>Simple. She's scared. She's almost been killed twice and now she is alone in a room with a man that she believes is an... assassin.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He slugs down the rest of his drink and stands, whipping out his gun.</context>
      <utterance>Furthermore she was brought here not entirely on her own accord which only increases her fear and suspicion. Thus, as long as she is afraid, her first, maybe her only thought will be escape. Does that leave me any other option?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Crossing the room, he turns the gun around and offers it to her. She looks at it. Back at him. He puts it on the bed beside her, turns his back and walks to the bar. She picks up the gun.</context>
      <utterance>No.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She stands, Nikita jumping from her lap.</context>

      <context>She starts squeezing OFF ROUNDS; the LAMP EXPLODES, the CHAIRS around him ERUPT, tufts of white stuffing leaping into the air.</context>

      <context>She moves closer to him, the gun squeezed in her fist.</context>

   <speaker>ELECTRA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A slight shake of the head, no.</context>

   <speaker>ELECTRA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She FIRES the GUN to both sides of his head. He's surprised to be alive.</context>
      <utterance>You're thinking that maybe it was a mistake to give me this gun, that maybe I'm not going to think about things logically because I'm a woman and I'm freaked out and I'm going to do something impulsive and irrational -- right?</utterance>
   <speaker>ELECTRA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He returns to his chair and sits with the same expression she had worn sitting a moment ago. She opens the cabinet and grabs one of the sample bottles of liquor. She sucks it all down and throws the bottle across the room. Grabbing another, she sits on the edge of the bed.</context>
      <utterance>You don't know shit about me! Now sit down!</utterance>

   <speaker>RATH</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>No. They hired Bain. The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELECTRA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So this is something between you and him?</utterance>

      <utterance>Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Because he is trying to retire me.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELECTRA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He wants to kill you?</utterance>

      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELECTRA</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The nature of the business. You remove your competition.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELECTRA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And you want to use me to get him?</utterance>

      <utterance>Right.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELECTRA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.</utterance>

      <utterance>It's simple. You need me. I need you. And we will both need money.</utterance>

      <utterance>This is something that is never going to end. You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding. And that's going to take money, a lot of money.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELECTRA</speaker>

      <utterance>Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>

      <utterance>No. It's the truth. I know what you are. Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world. You don't have a social security number. You don't pay taxes. You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years. A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy. You think you can do it again. But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing. No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.</utterance>

      <context>She is coming unglued. Imagining him watching her tapes, going through her possessions. She is moving, pacing, ready to explode.</context>
      <utterance>Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment. He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets. He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books. If you keep a diary, he is reading it. He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke. In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled. If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.</utterance>

      <context>When she stops, he starts to say something but she levels the gun at him.</context>
      <utterance>He will know everything about you. Everything. I know, because I've done it. Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him. She whirls and starts FIRING the GUN, firing it everywhere, fear and anger rocketing out of her in WHISTLING hot wads of LEAD.</utterance>

      <utterance>The same reason everyone does. You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.</utterance>

   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money. Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.</utterance>

   <speaker>RATH</speaker>

      <utterance>No. It would be amateur. A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming. Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself. He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed. 5:45. 5:50. He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.</utterance>

      <utterance>Why won't he wait until the bank closes?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He won't be able to. He'll have to go inside. He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there. If the bank closes, he won't know for sure. He'll come. I'm sure. And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.</utterance>

   <speaker>ELECTRA</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>That means you won't have a gun.</utterance>

   <speaker>ELECTRA</speaker>

She watches him and then begins to study it with him, the way a child does, almost imitating him. She does not want to be left alone right now. She reaches over and moves a white knight. He blinks. His eyes shifting, sorting the possibilities. He picks a bishop and counters. After another sequence, he takes her bishop and she takes his knight.</context>

      <context>They rise up from the table, together, knocking over the chess game. The pieces fall to the floor. They grab at each other, kissing, both of them hungry, aggressive. They tear at each other's clothes and at their own clothes; it has a very awkward sense to it, as they become naked in front of each other. There is nothing smooth or fluid about it, which makes it seem very real. He takes her, lifting her onto the table. She scoots and wiggles back, the chess pieces falling out of the way. She opens her legs and he moves in between them.</context>
      <utterance>I know. That's why I'm attracted to you. I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating. Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.</utterance>

      <context>She is not listening; she is rushing down the hall, back toward the stairs. Just as she grabs the rail, she hears BAIN STORMING INTO THE LOBBY below. She begins climbing the stairs, quickly but quietly. Bain is a rampaging beast, lunging up the stairs.</context>
      <utterance>Electra, listen! You have got to come to the bank for the money! The money!</utterance>

      <context>Bain FIRES up at the ceiling, the BULLET tearing through the floor, WHIZZING past Electra's head. If she moves he'll know her position. He FIRES another. Electra sinks down, her back against the wall and aims at the floor. Another SHOT. She FIRES back. Bain closes, as they both start FIRING, silenced WEAPONS, flashing, PUMPING LEAD at unseen targets. Her gun empties first. He laughs hearing the CLICK.</context>

      <context>Rath's scream ECHOES up through the building. Before Bain can target him, Rath is gone; a shadow, a ghost. He scans the hotel's courtyard. The last light from the setting sun slips through the slits, cracks and broken window panes, casting patterns; a surreal dream- like grid resembling a chess board. Electra sees her chance. She leaps to her feet, throwing the gun over the balcony. The two men watch the GUN CLATTER to the floor as she races back to the room.</context>

      <context>The blackened DOOR JAMB SPLINTER-BURSTS in front of her. She bounces, scrambling on all fours into the room. Bain hurries down the hall after her as Rath bolts for the stairs. Seeing Rath exposed on the stairs, Bain whips around and FIRES, the WALL SHREDDING behind Rath as he dives back down into the shadows. Ripping open Bain's duffel bag Electra grabs Bain's .22. Bain advances steadily, the rifle trained on the door. Inside the room Electra grunts, hurling the duffel bag out the door. It spins over the balcony and plummets to the ground and bursts open. A GUN CLIP SKITTERS across the stone tile coming to rest in the middle of the courtyard. Rath and Bain both see it. Staying hidden, Rath immediately circles towards it. Bain sweats, looking at the door, down at the clip, then back at the door. Something's got to give. Unsure what to do Electra waits, the gun clenched between her two hands, covering the empty, dark space of the door. Bain makes his choice, moving towards room 502. Rath sees that Bain is going after Electra. He takes a slow breath and tears from the shadows -- Bolting into the open, Rath is focused wholly on the clip, the ground a blur beneath him -- Bain reacts; the rifle swings, rushing, arcing after Rath. Two more steps and Rath dives, sliding, snagging the clip as -- The RIFLE SPITS -- Rath screams, his leg erupting with blood.</context>

      <context>Bain squeezes the trigger -- CLICK -- the rifle is empty. Bain screams in disbelief. Rolling over, Rath jacks back the slide and sights the balcony but Bain is gone.

      <context>Bain explodes through the wall, charred wood and plaster flying. Electra spins to shoot but the FLOOR suddenly CRACKS OPEN, swallowing her. Limping, lurching up the stairs, Rath hears the CRASH. Jarred by the fall, Electra drags herself away from the open ceiling.</context>
      <utterance>Electra!</utterance>
   <speaker>RATH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She looks up for Bain but he has again disappeared. She looks at the gun, thinking, turning it over in her hands. His leg soaked with blood, Rath rumbles down the hall. Black with soot, Bain descends soundless, serpent-like to the fourth level through another burned opening. Electra moves towards the door aiming at every sound, at every dark corner. She is almost there when we see Bain, a shadow coming to life, emerging behind her. Lumbering, Rath is halfway there, his eyes riveted on the door to room 502. Hearing Bain, Electra turns. In one smooth motion, he snatches her arm and breaks her wrist. The gun falls. Rath hears her scream. Electra kicks at his groin but he drops, leg sweeping her to the ground. She gropes for the gun when he kicks her in the face, jack-knifing her body back, knocking her unconscious. Bain grabs the gun. Rath whips into the room BLASTING -- BULLETS CHASING Bain as he disappears into a blackened hole. Rath goes to Electra not knowing if she is alive or dead. Gently he turns her, cradling her head, her face, smeared with blood. From within the labyrinth, Rath hears BAIN begin to LAUGH.</context>
