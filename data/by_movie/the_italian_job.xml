      <utterance>I've got the orbital data and SV clock corrections for each satellite that gets the signal. That'll make my reading as solid as the Precise Positioning Service that only the D.O.D. can use.

      <utterance>I tracked Steve down to an address in the Hollywood Hills. He's changed his last name to Frezelli. And get this: he had a Worthington 1000 installed in the house before he even moved in. We both know that you don't install a Worthington 1000 unless you have something precious to guard.</utterance>

      <utterance>We boosted that gold from a terrorist group that was about to trade it for bio-weapons. Now that doesn't exactly make us Robin Hood, but maybe in our own little way we were doing a good deed. Problem is, no one in my crew can handle that safe. And I need someone I can trust.</utterance>

Half-Ear studies the spider... then he closes his eyes just a moment... relaxes... breathes in, breathes out... and then -- He leans forward, opens his mouth and clamps his lips over the spider, comes back up. Finishes inserting the wire. Job done, he calmly opens his mouth. The spider puts a hairy leg out and delicately explores his cheek.
