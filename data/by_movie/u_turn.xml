      <context>There is a loud pop from the front of the Mustang and a thick cloud of steam now pours from the hood. The temperature gauge now starts rising.</context>
      <utterance>Fuck you!</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A couple of SEMIS roar past in the opposite direction, buffetting the Mustang with their air waves.</context>

      <context>Bobby looks around for someone, anyone. After a few moments he reaches into the car and blows the horn. He waits, then blows it again. From out of the station walks DARRELL - a slow-looking man in coveralls caked with grease and dirty. He looks the part of a yokel.</context>
      <utterance>Oh shit!</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You Harlin?</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nope. Darrell.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Harlin around?</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Darrell points a scraggly finger at a plateau in the distance.</context>
      <utterance>He's up at the Look Out.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Will he be back soon?</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Doubt it. He's dead. The Look Out's a cemetery.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You own this place?</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yep.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then why do you call it Harlin's?</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>'Cause Harlin used to own it.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But he's dead.</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bobby is confused, but chooses to drop the matter.</context>
      <utterance>So?</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Darrell mops his brow with a greasy rag. It doesn't so much wipe the sweat as it does streak his forehead with dirt.</context>
      <utterance>Damn. Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither. Then of course the clouds come in...</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.</utterance>

      <utterance>Darrell--</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Darrell is clearly upset at being cut off. He leans into the car and looks at the engine.</context>
      <utterance>OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose. It's busted.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So?</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's your radiator hose. It's busted.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know it's busted. What did I just tell you?</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time. Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Somewhere else? Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Okay, I'm stuck. You happy? Now can you fix it, or not?</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, I can fix it.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Great!</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How much time?</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Time. BOBBY  What time is it now?</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Twenty-after-ten.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Jesus. Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bobby wipes the bandaged hand across his forehead.</context>
      <utterance>Ninety-two. Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Self-consciously Bobby quickly drops his hand to his side.</context>
      <utterance>What happened to your hand?</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Accident.</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You got to be more careful. Hands is important. Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Diner up a piece. Not much, but us simple folk like it.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you? Darrell slams down the hood.</utterance>
   <speaker>DARRELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bobby reaches into the car, pulls out a small ugly gym bag which he slings onto his shoulder and moves to the trunk, pops it open.</context>
      <utterance>Just a car.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The trunk lid rises in the air, partially blocking Bobby from Darrell, acting as a partition between them.</context>
      <utterance>It's not just a car. It's a sixty-four and half Mustang convertible. That's the difference between you and me, and why you live here and I'm just passing through.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He throws the car key to Darrell who takes the hint, spits grotesquely into the dirt, scratches his nuts, and walks back to the shack. Concealed by the trunk lid, Bobby pulls out a GUN (a .9mm black Baretta), wrapped in a t-shirt, from the top of the bag. Perhaps we see a flash of green money, lots of it. Sports pages and betting sheets are piled inside. With a look around, Bobby takes the gun and stashes it underneath the rubber mat in the trunk. Briefly we notice a towing ROPE under the mat. There is a small travel bag, from which he peels a fresh bottle of Percodan, quickly taking two, as well as the sports page.</context>
      <utterance>Now do you mind? I got to get some stuff out of the trunk.</utterance>

      <context>Bobby noticing a beautiful woman down the street, GRACE McKENNA, compulsively turns and catches up to her. She is dressed better than the usual t-shirts and tank tops of this town -- perhaps a mail-ordered dress or a mother's hand-me-down. With her raven hair and caramel skin, it is obvious she is Native American. Her arms are full with an awkward package she can barely manage.</context>
      <utterance>See. Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me. That's where he belongs anyways. Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes. He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.</utterance>

      <context>Bobby takes up the package and they begin walking again. The package seems to have gained weight.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bobby struggles with the package. Sweat starts to sheet his face. BOBBY (panting) That a fact?</context>
      <utterance>It's just new drapes and curtain rods. If I had known it was going to be so heavy I would have had them delivered up to the house.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I just got tired of looking at the old drapes. My mother made them. Had them long as I can remember. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it? BOBBY  Yes, I have.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They arrive at a JEEP SAHARA.</context>
      <utterance>'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending. But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself. I deserve nice things. BOBBY  I ... can't ... argue ...</utterance>
   <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bobby practically drops the package. He is covered with sweat.</context>

      <context>Grace steps to Bobby and places her hand against his chest. She rubs away some of the sweat. They look at each other a beat. A POLICE CAR, seen earlier, pulls up beside them from behind and idles. SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER is a weathered, handsome, middle-aged man with suspicious eyes, black haired in contrast to Bobby's sandiness.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too. Bobby wants to shrink behind the drapes.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.</utterance>

   <speaker>SHERIFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRACE</speaker>

      <utterance>Anybody hurt?</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bobby considers the offer, but there's not much considering to do.</context>
      <utterance>Well, I guess I could use some help getting this box into the house. Not far. You could shower, get something cool to drink.</utterance>

      <utterance>You a sailor man? That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.

      <mode></mode>
      <context>For a moment Bobby sits in silence not sure of what to make of the offer.</context>
      <utterance>Because I'm sick and tired of her little games. Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.</utterance>

      <context>As Bobby stares at the money on the counter in front of him, he hears, from somewhere outside the diner, the sound of a POLICE RADIO crackling. He now feels something against his foot. He looks down and sees a CAT rubbing against his leg. He gives it a good kick sending it sliding across the floor with a screech.</context>
      <utterance>...and a waitress named Flo. Christ.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>In the background, two teenagers sit at a booth. TOBY looks the part of a local, wearing jeans and a white T-shirt. His hair is cropped close and he looks to be a senior in high school. His girl, JENNY, is nondescript, neither ugly nor beautiful. She is the kind of girl most guys would pass without a second look. Toby gets up from his booth and goes to the bathroom. After he is gone Jenny walks to Bobby.</context>

      <context>Bobby looks at Jenny, then picks a quarter from his winnings and flips it to her. He can't resist putting a little charm into it.</context>

There is the crackle of a police radio as the door to the diner opens and SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER walks in. The tension eases. Toby, mindful of the sheriff, steps closer to Bobby and whispers menacingly into his ear.</context>

      <utterance>No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me.

I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you?

      <context>Bobby tenses himself. Sweat forms on his brow as he stands directly behind Grace with his hands extended before him. They hover just below her shoulder blades ready to push forward. Suddenly Grace wheels. Startled by Bobby she almost falls over the edge. Bobby grabs her, her weight still going back. Grace's life is literally in his hands. She looks down at the ground far below, then up into Bobby's eyes. She shows no fear, but instead wears a curious smirk.</context>
      <utterance>They say you don't feel anything. The shock kills you before you hit the ground. I don't know how they would know that. But I heard it's just like flying; straight down into the ground. I guess if it doesn't hurt it's a beautiful thing.</utterance>

As dangerous as you are unpredictable. behind Jake, the lifeless BOBBY rises up from the floor, very much alive, and clobbers Jake with a golf club. Jake is staggered, but he's one tough old customer as he manages to spin slowly, gun still in one hand, as if to fire. Before he can, Grace grabs up the hatchet from the floor and drives it straight into his back. He gurgles, stunned from both sides, but it's like trying to kill Rasputin. He still has the gun as Bobby jumps him from the rear, trying to get his neck in a chokehold. The gun FIRES once, discharging into the wall. The hatchet is ripped from his back. Grace watches as the two men bang into the walls in a rugged rodeo-type fight, Jake seeking to dislodge Bobby off his back. An expression of fear and excitement in her eyes. Finally the two men go crashing to the ground, rolling around, Bobby maintaining his stranglehold, but calling to her, his hands full.</context>
      <utterance>Aww, that's my Grace: Not about to let</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>She commits. Jumping into the fray, it's not clear whose side she's really on as the three of them roll across the floor, strangling, biting, hitting, spitting, scratching, gasping. It's a Guignol, but the pressure from Bobby's forearm is taking its toll on Jake. Trying to bite Jake, Grace bites Bobby instead, but then she scratches Jake's face. Jake is grabbing her hard as Bobby chokes him, trying to use her to leverage himself away. But she manages to rip herself from his grip and scrambles on her knees across the floor. She grabs the hatchet. And stands, moving back towards the two men locked on the floor. Bobby looks up at her, hatchet in hand, no longer sure which way she'll go. Jake, however, gasping for air, eyes bulging, spittle dripping from his mouth, looks at Grace with some inner certainty that she will help him. He gasps the words.</context>

      <context>Grace stands there, deciding, the power of the hatchet in her hands. She raises it suddenly over the two men. It flashes downwards. Deep into the gut of her husband Jake, almost transfixing him to the floor. In the silence that follows, Jake's eyes roll up to meet hers. But all she has for him is a cold, distant stare. Jake's head drops as the life rushes out of him. Bobby falls back from the body puffing and dripping with sweat.</context>
      <utterance>Like you helped her, Jake?</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She doesn't answer, turbulence in her face. He rolls Jake's body off, upset. She may have made it a murder, but he was part of it, and he feels the shift in himself. They're both in new territory, feeling an apartness between them. Suddenly</context>

   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He doesn't want to get close to Jake. Grace coldly runs over to his corpse, ripping the chain, key and all, from the neck. The action pulls Jake's head up, then she lets it thump back on the floor. She runs back to the floorboards. The top of a thick steel floor safe is revealed. Bobby watches -- his whole life, it seems, hanging on the outcome. With the key, she opens the safe. Inside are rolled-up bundles of cash -- in hundred dollar denominations. She looks up at him, offering it as she reaches in for more. Bobby also gets down on his hands and knees and grabs more and more, sucked into the fever of freedom, far more money than he lost at the grocery store, overcome now with emotions of fear and freedom. They see each other.</context>

And one little peep outta you -- remember that gun makes you part of the food chain. Your prints are all over it. I'd be awful careful whose rectum I was pointing my finger in, Darrell. Bobby hops in the car, a free man. As Darrell glares at him, bewildered and frightened at the same time.</utterance>

      <utterance>I can't throw that far. You got to climb down here and get the keys. You can make it. It's the only way Grace.</utterance>

      <utterance>Grace!...Please, Grace! You have to help me. Grace takes a look around.</utterance>

      <context>She starts down the cliff face. As she descends, he talks deliriously. BOBBY (off) I knew you'd help me. I knew you wouldn't leave me baby, cause we're tied together too close. We belong together always. Grace makes it to the bottom of the drop, and walks cautiously towards Bobby. GRACE (yelling back, echoing) Bobby! Don't flip out on me. I can't do this alone. I know you don't trust me, but you gotta pull yourself together, I'm not gonna leave you...I never wanted it to go down like this. It was different with you Bobby. You had dreams like me. You listened... I would've gone anywhere with you, Bobby. We can make this work. I'm sorry...I really am. I didn't wanna hurt you. Can he believe her? She sounds so sincere this time. She's heading for the body of Jake. And the gun. Bobby knows that and is already crawling there. BOBBY (as he crawls) They're right here, Grace. The keys. Come get me out of here... Know why else I could never leave you?</context>
      <utterance>Okay. I'm coming. Calm down!</utterance>

      <utterance>Why's that?</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Closer. They meet at the apex of Jake's corpse.</context>
      <utterance>'Cause I love you. Inching closer.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And I love you too.</utterance>

      <context>Grace leans close to Bobby. He dangles the keys out in front of her, but she doesn't reach for them. Her eyes go to Bobby. She reaches for him. At that instant Bobby's hands shoot out and clamp hard around her. A sharp gurgle is all that escapes Grace as Bobby twists the life from her, as Jake leers up at them.</context>
      <utterance>And love's a funny thing. Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...</utterance>
