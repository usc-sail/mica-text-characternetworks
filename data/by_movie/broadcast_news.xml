   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No. But, honest. What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks? I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick." Gerald stiffs a grin.</utterance>
   <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <context>He shakes his head for emphasis, glad he's received this pep talk from himself -- he hands the card to his father.</context>
      <utterance>I'll just have to try harder. I don't know. I will.  I will. I will. I will.</utterance>

      <context>He awaits a laugh and gets only the weird sound of collective discomfort.</context>
      <utterance>...and finally to the teachers of Whitman High School, I don't have the words to express my gratitude which may have more to say about the quality of the English Department here than my own limitations...</utterance>
   <speaker>AARON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This is very little applause.</context>
      <utterance>...that was, of course, not meant to be taken seriously. A personal note. I am frequently asked what the special difficulties are in being graduated from High School two months shy of my fifteenth birthday. I sometimes think it was the difficulties themselves which enabled me to do it. If I'd been appreciated or even tolerated I wouldn't have been in such a hurry to graduate. I hope the next student who comes along and is able to excel isn't made to feel so much an outcast. But I'm looking forward to college; this is the happiest day I've had in a long time. I thank you and I forgive you.</utterance>

Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.

      <utterance>What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around? Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail. No. I'm semi-serious here. He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit. And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  And he'll get all the great women.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yes, yes. I know. Right.
