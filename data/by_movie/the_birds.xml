      <utterance>I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MACGRUDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And he'll talk?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MACGRUDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MACGRUDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address.</utterance>

      <context>As Melanie starts writing:</context>

   <speaker>MRS. MACGRUDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight. Melanie finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.</context>
      <utterance>Well, all right, but...</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MACGRUDER</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up.</context>
      <utterance>Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at Davidson's.  It's past three, you know.  Well, how long do you think...? All right, would you check it please? Yes, I'll wait.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I understand completely, sir.</utterance>

      <utterance>As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.</utterance>

   <speaker>MITCH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.</utterance>
   <speaker>MITCH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.</utterance>

   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>

   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How'd you happen to come here?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Melanie nods.</context>
      <utterance>Look, I see no reason for being coy about this. It was Mitch Brenner.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I guess you knew that, anyway.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I suspected as much.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What do you mean?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>When was this?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died. Things may be different now.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Different?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A trifle.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And what had you done?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then what was it?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then why did she object to you?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Because she was afraid.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Afraid you'd take Mitch?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Afraid I'd give Mitch.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't understand.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see. She's only afraid of being abandoned.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She already has a daughter.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I see.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You get straight to the point, don't you?</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry. Forgive me.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I did.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.</utterance>
   <speaker>MELANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And the second?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever. There is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE shrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer it.</utterance>

      <context>Melanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie talks to Mitch in the background. Annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.</context>

      <utterance>Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine, thank you. No, no trouble at all. I simply followed the road. It's a very bright night.  What? Oh. Well, there's no need to apologize. I can understand...  Well...  That's very kind of you. No, I'm not angry.  I couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get back to San Francisco.  No, I wouldn't want to disappoint Cathy, but...  I see.  I see. Well, if you really...  All right. Yes, I'll be there.  Good night, Mitch.</utterance>

      <utterance>They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.</utterance>

      <utterance>Continuing with the local news, police are still investigating the series of valuable jade burglaries in the Chinatown area. The round-up of known criminals has not as yet produced a suspect, but Commissioner Nelson said today he was certain the burglaries were quote linked and the work of the team of professionals unquote.  In Bodega Bay early this morning, a large flock of crows attacked a group of children who were leaving the school during a fire drill. One little girl was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but the majority of children reached safety in the town.  On the national scene today, the opening of the new session of Congress was marked by a State of the Union address that...</utterance>

      <utterance>The goal of a peaceful world of free and independent states. This is our guide for the present and our vision for the future -- a free community of nations, independent but interdependent, uniting north and south, east and west, in one great family of man, outgrowing and transcending the hates and fears that rend our age. We will not reach that goal today or tomorrow. We may not reach it in our lifetime. But the quest is the great adventure of our century. We sometimes chafe at the burdens of our obligations, the complexity of our decisions, the agony of our choices, but there is no comfort or security for us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no relief in irresponsibility.  In assuming the tasks of the Presidency, I said that few generations, in all history, had been granted the role of being the great defender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger. This is our good fortune, and I welcome it now as I did when I first took office.  For it is the fate of this generation -- Of you in the Congress and of me as President -- to live with a struggle we did not start, in a world we did - not make. But the pressures of life are not always distributed by choice. And while no nation has ever faced such a challenge, no nation has ever been ready to seize the burden and the glory of...</utterance>
