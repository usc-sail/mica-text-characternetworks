   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MacReady takes a sip of his drink; makes his way over to his electronic chess game. A large Mexican sombrero hangs on his back. He is tall; about thirty-five. His shack is sparse but unkempt. A few centerfolds on the wall are interspersed by an occasional poster of some Mediterranean or South American paradise. The chess game is of larger than normal size. The pieces move automatically with the press of a button. He sits down and chuckles over his opponent's bad move.</context>
      <utterance>Bishop to knight four.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He confidently taps out his move. His companion's response is immediate.</context>
      <utterance>Poor little son of a bitch. You're starting to lose it, aren't you?</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MacReady's grin slowly fades as he examines the board. There is a pounding at his door. MacReady broods for a bit, heedless of his visitor and makes his next move.</context>
      <utterance>Pawn takes queen at knight four.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>More impatient pounding. MacReady glares at his opponent for a beat. He bends forward, opens up a flap containing the chess game's circuitry and pours in his drink. There ensues a snapping, popping sound as smoke and sparks rise from the machine; followed by a flush of chess gibberish. MacReady gets up from his seat, mumbling on his way to the door.</context>
      <utterance>Rook to knight six. Check.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He opens the door. Norris steps in followed by a flurry of snow and wind.</context>

   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They push, shove, grunt. The door gives a bit. Finally more. It widens enough for MacReady to see that a large computer- like machine is blocking their path. MacReady wedges in and shines the flashlight. It is the communications room. Holes in its roof have allowed in the freezing cold. The flashlight exposes the back of the radio chair. One more nudge allows them into the room. A beat as they catch their breath. MacReady spots a Coleman lantern. He lights it with a match. Holds it up. The brighter light exposes the top of a man's head sitting in the radio chair.</context>
      <utterance>Give me a hand.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The chair rocks slightly with the gentle breeze. They inch closer. A yard from the chair, MacReady stops the Doctor. He pokes his gun at the chair's back.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, Sweden...! You okay?</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dr. Copper spots something. From the man's wrist on the armrest, he follows a long, yarn-thick, red line, ending in a pool of frozen blood on the floor. The two men step around the chair. The Norwegian stares up in blanched death. A gaping black hole for a mouth. His throat and wrists slit. An old-fashioned straight razor in his lap. MacReady turns off the hissing radio, and marches to the other door. It is locked and barricaded.</context>
      <utterance>Sweden?!</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. COPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>My God, what in hell happened here?</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The two men free a machine-like obstacle from the other exit. MacReady opens a lock and pushes the door open. More blackness. Stronger wind. Copper holds the lantern high as they make their way down a row of wooden steps and into a cavernous, underground causeway.</context>
      <utterance>Come on, Copper.</utterance>

      <context>He tries the door. Unlocked. It opens. The arm drops to the ground. It has been severed by the force of the slam. Its owner is nowhere to be seen. MacReady, sickened, coughs. Dr. Copper mumbles.</context>
      <utterance>Holy shit...</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. COPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They step over the arm and into another slim passageway. Moving along they come to rest in front of a door with Norwegian lettering on it. MacReady pushes it open with his foot. Dozens of papers fly about, flailed by the holes in the Quonset hut-style roof. The place is a wreck. They enter. MacReady surveying the small room with his flashlight.</context>

   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He exits. Amongst the rubble, Dr. Copper finds a pocket tape recorder and several cassettes. He selects a tape and is about to pop it in when he senses something to his rear. He turns. Looks. A beat. Nothing.</context>
      <utterance>It's getting late. Hurry it. I'm going to check the last few rooms.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Copper dusts himself. MacReady stands before a huge block of ice. Fifteen feet long. Six feet wide. Four feet tall. It has partially melted, but its thawing process has been stopped by the now freezing temperatures within the outpost. Its one curious feature: the middle has been thawed and scooped out. Giving it the appearance of a large bathtub. The two men study it uncomprehendingly. MacReady's gaze turns to a large metal cabinet at his left. He moves for a closer look. Several photographs are pasted to its door. Small snapshots of the Norwegians at work and play. He tries to open it. Stuck. The partially caved-in ceiling is slightly blocking the top of the door. He tries again, careful not to dislodge the wood and plaster above. Bits of dust float down.</context>
      <utterance>Careful. It's about to go.</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. COPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His grip is too strong. It gives suddenly, unexpectedly. The large metal door flies open. Large chunks splash from the ceiling. They come thumping to the floor, behind and in front of the open cabinet door. MacReady coughs and waves away the dust. He peers inside. Nothing much. Some empty shelves. Some small scientific gear. His flashlight then locates a large photograph taped to the inside of the cabinet door. It is a picture of five Norwegians, arm in arm, all smiles, toasting each other. They are on either side of the frozen block of ice, pridefully displaying it for the camera. The block looks much thicker. Its interior opaque. MacReady looks to the block of ice and then back to the photograph. He untapes it, pockets it and shuts the door. An armless corpse swings into his face from behind the closing door. Dislodged from the ceiling, the body and MacReady go crashing to the floor.</context>

      <context>Displayed on the slab is what appears to be the corpse of a man. Badly charred. What is left of the trousers and shoes of the bottom torso are ripped and split, as if his legs and feet had burst from the inside. His upper body is an almost undecipherable gnarled mass of protoplasmic mush. The head is strangely disfigured and looks larger than normal. It is situated not on its shoulders but near the abdomen. Tendon-like appendages are wrapped around the carcass and sticking up and out in odd postures. One is wrapped around the body's left leg. The shirt has been ripped and lies shredded in the tar-like mess. The men grimace.</context>

Childs and MacReady turn, confused, unable to see anything be Bennings' screaming head. They rush toward him. MacReady stumbles. The sound of a snapping, a crackling to MacReady's rear.

He recovers and dumps cans of gasoline on the writhing mess. He dives and rolls away from the lunging appendage. He and Childs watch on as Bennings and The Thing roar in flame. Behind them, the other dog/Thing continues to burn. The screeching, mewing and gurgling wails on, all about them.

      <context>Crunch. The door gives. The men move in. Their blow torches ready. They freeze. MacReady stands before them holding a lighted flare.

MacReady spins Nauls off and rips into Norris, sending him crashing violently into the wall. Nauls tackles MacReady's legs, pulling him to the floor. The others rush him. MacReady, still in control of the dynamite and flare, bellow:</context>

   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>

      <context>He unloads with a stream of flame. The body writhes in pain, belching and hissing. The slab catches fire. It struggles, lunges for the floor, straightens up, and moves a few feet. A black and yellow substance rips through its trousers and squirts to the floor. Norris' body collapses on the fibrillating machine in flames. Extinguishers are ripped from the walls and put to work. MacReady watches the smoking particles of ooze in fascination, as they twitch and mew on the floor. Within seconds the fire is out. The men stand around in awe as they look upon The Thing that was once Norris. MacReady continues to observe the small particles. Their tiny squeals abating into silence.</context>

      <context>It's all happened too fast. Copper tries to get off a burst of flame. The ever-changing Palmer breaks his bonds and leaps on the Doctor. The others sit helpless, struggling at their bindings. MacReady dives on Palmer's back and the three go rolling to the floor. Screeching. Crackling. MacReady pounds viciously at Palmer's head. A powerful, shirt-splitting arm sends him skidding across the floor. Copper momentarily has control of the torch. Just as he positions it, Palmer's mouth splits from his chin to his forehead and engulfs the entirety of the Doctor's head. The big torch slaps against the wall. Palmer bounds to his feet, wrapping his arms around the dangling, struggling body of Dr. Copper. The men are screaming hysterically. MacReady tries to fire up the bruised torch. Busted. Won't work. Frustrated, he charges up behind Palmer and begins hammering the thick steel instrument over his head. The shirt of Palmer's back erupts in MacReady's face. Splitting and ripping wildly, exposing the beginnings of yet another orifice. A blackened, iron-strong tongue lunges outward. Stunned, MacReady manages to elude it, diving for the top of the table by the boxes of dynamite. MacReady lights the fuse of a thick roll and bounds from the table. Palmer awkwardly spins in circles, swinging the Doctor's body like a propeller blade, struggling to keep on balance, as he advances on MacReady. The second orifice, spitting and snarling as it continues to take form. MacReady waits until Palmer's back spins around, facing him. Only two yards away, MacReady flings his lit roll into the ever-evolving second mouth and leaps onto the couch covering Childs and Garry with his body. A muffled boom, as the swallowed explosive ignites from deep within Palmer and sends his flesh splattering all over the room. MacReady rolls away from Childs and Garry as fast as he can.</context>

      <context>A blaring. They whip their attention to stereo speakers on either side of the kitchen. Rock music screams out. Top volume.</context>

      <context>The music is now subdued within the room, but continues booming throughout the camp. Nauls' scream can be barely heard.</context>
      <utterance>What are they doing out there?!</utterance>

      <utterance>What's he saying?</utterance>
   <speaker>NAULS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A sharp, red, talon-like fingernail, pierces the top of the door above Nauls' head. It saws downward, quickly. Black goo drips through the slit. The sawing obscured by the music. Sanchez, eyes bulging, points. Nauls turns. A claw rips through the wood. Nauls dives to the floor. In the opposite direction, behind Sanchez, another arm splits through the door and the refrigerator, extends itself five feet and yanks Sanchez back as if he were a puppet. Sanchez struggles, looking imploringly at Nauls. He bites down on his capsule. Nauls takes off like a speed skater.</context>
      <utterance>MacReady! We been cut off!!</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He opens the door. Looks down the hall. No one. The speakers -- blaring music.</context>

      <utterance>Little over two hours.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then we go after him.</utterance>
   <speaker>NAULS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The sound of a door opening and closing. Far off. Another creaking door is opened. A rustling. Still far off. MacReady and Nauls spread further apart. The soft bubbling, cooling sound. A slight scratch at the door. Garry's hand tightens around the generator switches. The scratching gets more pronounced. MacReady cautions Garry with a whisper.</context>
      <utterance>Bet the last place you ever go.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The door begins to pound from the outside. Nauls and MacReady light two cocktails each. The door booms. The room's foundations shake. The ceiling quivers. The gas bombs are cocked. From the roof The Thing roars down into their midst. Stunned, the men stumble back. MacReady throws his gas bomb. Nauls the same. For a moment it stands silhouetted in flame. Enormous. Grotesque. Garry bolts for the main door. The Thing's tongue spirals from his mouth and spears him. The good two-thirds of its body follows its tongue and engulfs Garry by the door. Another leg slaps Nauls to the ground. MacReady dodges still another appendage, dives on the generators and throws the switch. The current rips through the door. Garry dies instantly. One of The Thing's talons, still caught in the door, sends it writhing in pain. It literally rips the door from its latchings and pounds it to the ground, trying to shake it loose. Nauls, hobbles, scrambles, out of the opening. MacReady dives through the window and out into the storm.</context>
      <utterance>Wait...</utterance>

   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He pulls off the heavy hydrogen tanks and drapes them over the tractor. As he talks his eyes move like a hawk passing from roof, to doorways, to rubble. Wind and ice bristle through the gaping holes, stinging MacReady with the cold. He winces at his mittenless, blackened fingers.</context>
      <utterance>Damn it, ran out of gas.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He takes a swig from his bottle.</context>
      <utterance>Sweetheart, it's going to get mighty cold in here soon... You better make your move... I mean, hell, I'm only one person...</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A slight tremor perks his eyes and ears. He looks up through the hole, then around. He lights a lighter and cups it in his hand near the stick of dynamite in his lap.</context>
      <utterance>I know you're bugged because we ruined your trip, right? Spiffy little toy you had there.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A stronger tremor. The adrenalin pumps.</context>
      <utterance>But your real hang up is your looks...</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The floor shakes. MacReady stands, his head whirling around the room.</context>
      <utterance>Atta boy. I know you're around.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The tractor inches up off the ground. MacReady falls forward and looks straight down through the chassis and into the vile and grinning face below. A claw flashes up, splitting the steering wheel but missing his face. He depresses the ignition, bolting the tractor ten feet. He jumps, hanging onto the edge of the hole in the ceiling. The Thing's face and arms burst through the metal plating of the tractor. The reaching claws just miss him as he pulls himself through.</context>
      <utterance>Come on, sucker.</utterance>

   <speaker>CHILDS</speaker>

      <context>Childs steps back, keeping his distance. He indicates his puffy white hand.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah. I got it.  Pretty mean frostbite.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHILDS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MacReady, carrying the bottle and glass, limps over and sits down behind a gaming table. There is a chess set and several decks of cards. The two men continue to eye each other.</context>
      <utterance>It'll turn black again soon enough. Then I guess I'll be losing the whole thing...  ...Think my toes are already gone.</utterance>

      <utterance>Maybe we shouldn't.</utterance>

      <context>MacReady puffs on his cigar. He reveals a small blowtorch from under the table and places it beside him on top.</context>
      <utterance>Then we'll never make it.</utterance>

      <context>They regard each other for a moment. Childs painfully sits down across from MacReady.</context>
      <utterance>If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.  You play chess?</utterance>

      <utterance>I guess I'll be learning.</utterance>
