      <context>TIGHT ON DEREK. Shaved head, rolled-up sleeves, tattoos, loosened tie, LA COPY CENTER name tag from earlier. His charisma draws their attention as he rambles over the crackling rainfall.</context>
      <utterance>Things were fine on the homefront. My Mom had a good job but a below average boyfriend. We had a four-bedroom house that Dad left us with. Everyone was happy.</utterance>

      <utterance>Fuck you, Murray. White men don't cruise the streets of LA killing each other.</utterance>
   <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>

      <context>Derek stares at the man, eyes filled with homicide.</context>
      <utterance>No. You guys make bombs.</utterance>
   <speaker>DEREK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're so fucking lame. A couple of cranks in cabins in Montana is not statistically significant.  White Americans don't take PCP and drink and drive a hundred and twenty fuckin' miles an hour! We pull over and trust the law.</utterance>

      <utterance>Don't you know, Murray? White people never break the law. We're perfect little angels.</utterance>
   <speaker>DEREK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's not what I said, Davina.  Three different times Rodney King comes at those officers with the intent to hurt them. To hurt them! Three times! But since we see it on some fucking tampered videotape...the bleeding heart media makes you believe that he only comes at them once. All we see is Powell, Koon and Wind hittin' him and--  Briseno kickin' him in the back of the fuckin' skull with his boot. Still, the dumbfuck's tryin' to get up and kick their asses! That's how stupid that motherfucker is. Those cops used textbook-solid tactics and if Dad were still here he'd say the same damn thing.</utterance>
   <speaker>DORIS</speaker>

      <context>Davina starts to laugh.</context>
      <utterance>No. Appropriately. Appropriately! Cops have been granted a certain amount of authority by society and white people, unfortunately, are the only ones who acknowledge it. I acknowledge a cop's authority.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVINA</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's two errors in one sentence, Davina, so take a fucking course in semantics. First error--I didn't say I respect the law. I said I respect a cop's authority. Second error...I'm not a member of the fuckin' low rent, disorganized, redneck Ku Klux Klan.. Pull your head outta your ass and look at who you're dealing with.</utterance>

      <utterance>If he did though! If that shithead killed Dan...you would have believed the beating to be justified and so would everybody else. But since he didn't hit anyone...it's "Hands Across America" for the son of a bitch.</utterance>

      <context>TIGHT ON DANNY. He gets up quickly and tries to pull Derek off. Derek turns and cracks Danny in the face with a BACKHAND, dropping him back into a cabinet. A crystal vase with flowers crashes to the floor, just missing Danny's head.</context>

      <utterance>Stay back, both of you! It's her bed, she's gotta lie in it.  You can cry all you want, Davina. I'm not gonna let go until you tell me what I wanna hear! Are you going to shut that fat fucking mouth of your's and let my girlfriend tell her opinion? Are you?!</utterance>
   <speaker>DORIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Derek releases his grip on his sister and she spits the roast beef onto the floor. She runs into the back bedroom crying, choking and coughing.</context>

      <context>YOUNGER DANNY stares at his larger-than-life father with a cap turned backwards. Doris breaks from song and yells to the back.</context>
      <utterance>That was Dad. They were best friendS. Fathers and sons are never best friends...but they were..</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Okay! Let's go, Davina! Derek!</utterance>
   <speaker>DORIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dennis doesn't hear because his attention is on Danny. YOUNGER DEREK, donning a flat-top haircut and no tattoos, walks into the kitchen. The smiling athlete has his backpack and blue VENICE HIGH gym bag. He drops it all onto the ground and sits at the table.</context>
      <utterance>So what's this all about, Dennis?</utterance>
   <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>DEREK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Doris sets food in front of her two sons and they both go to work. Young Danny eats quietly.</context>
      <utterance>Good morning.</utterance>
   <speaker>DORIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What about this gang stuff?</utterance>
   <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Jesus Doris...it's not that big of a deal. All departments have to take a precaution class on gang patrol today.</utterance>
   <speaker>DEREK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What for?</utterance>
   <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A guy was shot yesterday in Inglewood...changin' a valve on a hydrant. LAPD is worried that more firefighters will become targets. That's what this bullshit is about.  A good father this guy was though and now he's in intensive care because of some goddamn--! They've pretty much declared war on LAPD and us.</utterance>
   <speaker>DORIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why you guys though? I can see them but the fire department?</utterance>
   <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They think we would rather let a building burn down over there than fight it. So now we got two fights goin' on at one goddamn time. Dennis takes a bite of his eggs and explodes.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll tell you one more thing. This "affirmative blaction" shit is driving me up the fucking wall. Firefighters gettin' 99's on their tests while rappers who score a goddamn 62 walk away with the job.</utterance>
   <speaker>DANNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't we have to have "affirmative action?"</utterance>
   <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not when a job requires ability. No.</utterance>
   <speaker>DORIS</speaker>

      <utterance>A lot of people say otherwise, Danny.</utterance>
   <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Doris just stares at the back of her husband's head like she wants to smack it. He turns back and disarms her with a look.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>If I'm fightin' a brush fire... surrounded by thousand degree flames...who would I want watchin' my back? A guy who scores a 99 or a guy who scores a sixty?  You don't see half the NBA with whites, gooks and spics.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nooo...what you don't see are minorities on the boards of Fortune 500 companies cause whites won't stand for it.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Really? I didn't know you spoke "African", Derek? Where'd you learn that shit? Johannesberg? Dennis laughs and Derek eventually smiles. Danny looks at them, not really understanding. Doris stares down Dennis.</utterance>
   <speaker>DORIS</speaker>

      <context>They don't--</context>
      <utterance>Honey? Please don't speak that way.</utterance>

      <utterance>How am I speaking, Doris!? Hunh?! I'm speakin' fineP  Hey. Don't let that him confuse you over there, Derek. Look at me. This shit he's pulling is a load of crap. Hey. Look at me, Derek. I mean it. If we keep givin' niggers everything, there'll be nothing left for us.</utterance>

      <context>Derek smiles at the little girl while he waits. She wanders from her mother's leg and over towards Derek.</context>
      <utterance>Maple bar and a...large milk.</utterance>
   <speaker>DEREK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She laughs.</context>

      <utterance>How do I look?</utterance>
   <speaker>BLACK GIRL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>DANNY'S POV. He looks up from the paper. He watches the girl together with his brother.</context>

      <utterance>How old are you, Tisha?</utterance>
   <speaker>BLACK MOTHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Tisha returns to her mother and they quickly exit. Derek watches the girl as she continues to stare at him as they make their way down the street. Outside, a BLUE FORD screeches out front. Rasmussen and the Young Mark Fuhrman type from earlier get out and wait. Dr. Sweeney meets the duo and together they walk inside.</context>
      <utterance>Come here, Tisha.</utterance>

   <speaker>DEREK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>How bad?</utterance>
   <speaker>RASMUSSEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They'll live.  They must have been looking for somebody else. Derek stares at Rasmussen and walks away. Sweeney, who knows to walk over to him. He eyes TIGHT ON SWEENEY AND DEREK. The two lock eyes.</utterance>
   <speaker>SWEENEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Are they coming after you?</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't know.  You might have to talk to your old crew though. Derek looks over and analyzes the innocence of his brother.</utterance>

      <context>Sweeney walks away and then turns back to Derek.</context>
      <utterance>Okay? Before it explodes.</utterance>
   <speaker>SWEENEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Derek nods.</context>

      <context>Derek puts his hand over the fence. Danny walks up and clasps it -- FINGERS INTERTWINED. Derek wants to say one thing but something else comes out.</context>
      <utterance>Come here.</utterance>
   <speaker>DEREK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Danny smiles at his brother and nods. Danny puts his ear phones on and heads to class. Derek watches his brother through the chain-link fence. Danny meets up with Lizzy and they soon disappear from Derek's sight. Derek turns and walks down the street.</context>

   <speaker>DANNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>THE DOOR SMACKS OPEN and Danny moves to grab the pistol. It discharges and a bullet rockets into Danny's chest. He SLAMS back into the URINAL and gasps for air. The force of the pistol knocks Henry to the ground. The two kids who just entered bolt for help. Danny slides to the tile, leaving a bloody trail. The two stare at each other - EYE TO EYE. THE BLOODSTAINED PAPER falls into the DAMP SINK. Danny inhales like glass is raking his lungs.</context>
