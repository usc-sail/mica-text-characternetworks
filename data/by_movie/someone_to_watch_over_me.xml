      <context>ANGLE ON TOMMY: in the hallway, trying to show SCOTTY'S date -- a "real" BIMBO, who's spilling out of her woolly sweater and tight jeans -- how to stand on his SKATEBOARD. She shrieks a laugh, toppling off. HELEN, passing by with an empty platter, catches the action.</context>

   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MIKE YANKS TOMMY under the TABLE, taking HIS PLACE in THE CHAIR; the COCKED GUN presses up against MIKE'S TEMPLE. ANGLE ON ELLIE: Her widened eyes continuing to INDICATE "beneath the table". CLOSE ON TOMMY, ON HIS KNEES, his hands tied behind his back; emitting a whimper of terror.</context>
      <utterance>I'll take his place, all right? Put the gun to my head.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>HE LOOKS UP: SPOTTING HER GUN, where she'd hidden it for safe-keeping, TAPED SECURELY, just OVER HIS HEAD. The FRONT DOOR OPENS -- with a SLOW CREAK -- the FIGURE OF CLAIRE, her dress silhouetted by the moonlight from outside, SEEN standing in the front hallway.</context>
      <utterance>Be careful, Tommy.</utterance>

      <context>The ACCOMPLICE is staggering upward as ELLIE gets to her feet, SQUARING OFF in POLICE STANCE -- and FIRES, catching him square between the SHOULDER BLADES; HE SPINS, crashing BACKWARDS through the GLASS DOOR -- SWISH-PAN to VENZA, trying to get out THE KITCHEN WINDOW...</context>
      <utterance>Stay down!</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He DOES, BLASTED by MIKE, and the "FIGURE" in the door, SIMULTANEOUSLY. He falls out the window, but still has life in him, staggering to his feet, and hit by SPOTLIGHTS from the CARS OUTSIDE. In a sudden barrage, he's hit by CROSSFIRE, SPINNING, LURCHING -- finally going down. And then all is quiet. INSIDE THE KITCHEN -- all sound and movement has suddenly ceased; everyone is a state of shock.</context>

   <speaker>KOONTZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>In the BACKGROUND distant SIRENS are HEARD heading toward. The SWAT squad. CAMERA MOVING ACROSS THE FACES OF ELLIE, TOMMY, MIKE... and KOONTZ; all holding in place. Listening to them come.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>LONG ANGLE on the ROOM: dimly illuminated by the single light, shed from the opened refrigerator door, as people begin to move -- awakening to life, and its necessary details, in the aftermath of the crisis.</context>
