      <context>And indeed, down below, the magician pulls the coin from the left pocket of the incredulous WOMAN's silk blazer. More laughter and applause. The study is in keeping with the rest of the house. Luxurious. Everything the best. WILLIAM STUCKEY, Edward's contemporary, is a crafty looking lawyer who is the party host. VANCE is an investment banker. His assistant JAKE, is a financial researcher. The other men are INVESTMENT BANKERS. They are in dark suits and power ties. On the table are stacks of documents and folders, the name "KROSS INDUSTRIES" is prominent on many of the folders.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Our banks certainly doesn't want to discourage Harris Enterprises from investing in California. We think this is a great new venue for you but you've got to understand the mergers and acquisitions market is changing. With the upswing in inflation we have to make these offerings tempting to offset the risk.</utterance>
   <speaker>VANCE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look, we're talking about hard assets and a straight liquidation. We have over a thousand man hours in this deal.</utterance>
   <speaker>STUCKEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This is a "no brainer". There's no risk for you. No one has ever lost money backing Mr. Harris.</utterance>

      <utterance>Not yet. But ship building is a new endeavor for you...</utterance>
   <speaker>STUCKEY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Come on. You know we're not going to go into ship building. Besides, you're the ones with the troubled track record, not us!</utterance>
   <speaker>INVESTMENT BANKER 3</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Bill, be reasonable. If you're really going to digest Kross Industries that quickly eighteen should not be such a problem. Besides, I don't think there's anywhere else you can go for the money in the time you have.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Edward turns from the window. He hasn't miss a thing. All eyes are on him.</context>
      <utterance>It's unacceptable.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The bankers speechlessly stare at him.</context>
      <utterance>Draymen Heux has offered me seventy-five in the pool at sixteen and a half. I can secure the other half personally. You have until tomorrow morning to make me a better offer.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He turns away. The bankers look at one another. They rise. Silence as they exit. When the door closes. Stuckey explodes with laughter.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>NO way! They'll come back. They can't afford not to. Edward, that bluff was beautiful.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>

      <context>The others stare at him, uncertain. Stuckey laughs. The others follow suit.</context>
      <utterance>Maybe I should have made it rhyme.</utterance>

      <context>Stuckey rises. Edward ushers Vance and Jake toward the door.</context>

      <context>He rises. Takes out his wallet. Standing over her, he drops THREE crisp, new hundred dollar bills in Vivian's lap. She picks up the bills, stares at them, trying not to be impressed. She puts the money in her jacket. She realizes Edward is standing over her as if waiting. She leans forward, reaches out to unzip his pants. He abruptly turns away.</context>

   <speaker>VIVIAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Edward sits back down. Vivian waltzes up the steps and opens the front door. A WAITER comes into the room with a silver cart; on it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl.</context>

      <utterance>Where would we like it? Here'll be fine.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIVIAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits. Vivian closes the door behind him. Vivian marches back down the stairs.</context>

   <speaker>VIVIAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Edward crosses to the silver stand. Vivian watches with interest as he twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket. VIVIAN (cont'd) You have a wife? Girlfriend?</context>
      <utterance>Tsk. Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Where are they? Shopping together?</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Edward pours the champagne into a single long stemmed glass and hands one to Vivian. EDWARD (cont'd) My ex-wife lives in London in what used to be my home. My girlfriend is in New York moving out of my apartment even as we speak. Cheers. He drinks, nods approvingly.</context>
      <utterance>They should be. They're both good at it.</utterance>

      <utterance>It's a very good year.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIVIAN</speaker>

      <context>Edward laughs softly. She sips it. To her surprise, really likes it. Edward lifts a lid on a silver bowl to reveal a dozen enormous strawberries.</context>
      <utterance>Oooh, thank god.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A moment. She slowly eats a strawberry. The juice of it stains her lips. Her eyes are like smoke as she takes a sensuous sip of champagne, licks away the stain of the strawberry. His eyes haven't left her.</context>

      <context>A moment. The abruptness of the question takes Edward back for a moment. But then he almost smiles.</context>
      <utterance>So young man, I understand you are trying to take over my company.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Please don't patronize me, Mr. Kross. Our ages mean nothing here.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>

      <utterance>Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock. We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>

      <utterance>Twenty-five percent.</utterance>
   <speaker>KROSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Edward, thankfully, now reaches for his salad fork and begins to eat. Relieved, Vivian picks up hers. They all eat for a moment.</context>
      <utterance>Mr. Harris, I built Kross Enterprises myself. I know every man who ever worked there by his first name. I know their wives... and their children. If your intention is to take over my company and turn it into a glorified real estate deal, think again.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>WAITERS approach, some to clear the salad plates, some to put down the next course. Vivian, thinking she's got to finish, quickly stuffs her mouth with the rest of her salad. She is reluctant to let the Waiter take her fork.</context>
      <utterance>What do you suggest, Mr. Kross?</utterance>
   <speaker>KROSS</speaker>

   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid. But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract. Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares. We would give you a promissory note...</utterance>

      <context>Escargot are put down in front of everyone. Vivian stares at them dubiously. She picks up what she assumes is the next "right" fork. She picks up a snail. The two do not fit. Flustered, she doesn't know what to do. No one else seems to be eating. And now a Waiter comes and places escargot forks at each place. Vivian picks it up with a sigh of relief.</context>
      <utterance>But I do know. I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.</utterance>

      <utterance>Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock. On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.</utterance>

   <speaker>KROSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing. Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.</utterance>
   <speaker>KROSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't question the legality of what you do. It's your morality that makes me sick. I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It is not your company. It's a public company. And I am going to acquire it. Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you. Vivian struggles with her escargot. EDWARD  I would suggest that you and your board cooperate with me, rather than fight a battle you don't have the ammunition to win. Vivian suddenly ZINGS her snail across the table.

And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time. He hated that.

      <context>He turns as Stuckey, James and David Kross, and Vance enter the room. They surround a conference table. Kross sits, the papers laid out in front of him. Stuckey hands Kross a pen. A SECRETARY lays out finger food. They wait for her to leave before they speak.</context>
      <utterance>Who indeed...</utterance>
   <speaker>STUCKEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If we can get these letters of intent out of the way now... Mr. Harris and I would like to ask you some questions about your company.</utterance>

      <utterance>Dad, excuse me, but that's inappropriate. You're under no obligation to answer any questions at all.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mr. Harris is preparing a bid based on our speculation of the corporation's net worth. The price he ultimately pays for your father's stock will be based on that bid. The more we know, the higher our bid can be.</utterance>
   <speaker>KROSS</speaker>

      <utterance>It's in my best interest to cooperate, David.</utterance>

      <context>He exits. A moment. Kross looks at Edward with a resigned smile.</context>
      <utterance>You bed it is.  You're everything he said you were.  Do what you have to do, Dad. Just don't expect me to watch it.</utterance>
   <speaker>KROSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He sighs. He picks up the pen. He's about to sign.</context>
      <utterance>He's young. He hasn't learned how to lose gracefully yet. I'll sign your papers. And I'll answer your questions. Whatever you want.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Stop. For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions before you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?</utterance>

      <utterance>This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?</utterance>
   <speaker>KROSS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Harris.</context>
