      <utterance>Maybe not.  By some estimates, 2% of the Japanese population had a meth problem after the war: factory workers, soldiers, pilots. Maybe that's why it took two bombs to get 'em to surrender. A nuclear blast is just a minor nuisance to a determined tweaker.</utterance>

I take it out from time-to- time, mix a little of it up in my dinner .... (looks at the plate of eggs) ... of breakfast. ON THE PLATE - little chunks of gray matter mixed in with the eggs. Pooh-Bear smiles knowingly. Danny turns pale.</context>
      <utterance>Look, you don't have to ... POOH-BEAR  So I'm standing there looking at this dude's brain and I'm thinking to myself, you know, this guy doesn't really need this thing.

      <context>Garcetti standing there pointing his gun at Danny, rocking slightly back and forth, a bullet hole in his cheekbone. He looks brain dead. Danny doesn't move. TANNER STILL WHEEZING. Garcetti looks like he wants to shoot his gun, but can't. He keeps looking down at his hand, trying to get it to obey. Danny calmly walks over and takes the gun from Garcetti. Garcetti puts his hand to his nose and blows out a clot of blood. He looks down at his hand. He has hacked up the bullet he was shot with. Garcetti smiles an embarrassed smile at Danny. TANNER'S WHEEZING</context>
      <utterance>Suddenly, A NOISE BEHIND DANNY.</utterance>

      <context>Danny smiles.</context>
      <utterance>My name is Tom Van Allen. I'm a trumpet player.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>COLETTE and QUINCEY standing there. Quincey holds a nine millimeter with a muzzle suppressor.</context>
      <utterance>Nah, you're Danny Flynne. He turns.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He shoots Danny in the stomach. Danny slumps to the floor. His cigarette falls out of his mouth and rolls under the bed. Colette freaks.</context>
      <utterance>You're a motherfucking rat.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLETTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She tries to go to Danny but Quincey stops her.</context>
      <utterance>You said you wouldn't kill him!</utterance>
   <speaker>COLETTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You lied to me!</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Danny looks at them, confused, a blood stain blossoming on his white shirt.</context>
      <utterance>Oops. My bad.</utterance>
   <speaker>DANNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Colette, what happened? Didn't the cops ...</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Danny looks from Quincey to Colette. Colette looks away. QUINCEY (cont'd) You fuck with the Mexicali Boys, this is what you get, homes. UNDER THE BED - the cigarette smoldering on the carpet. QUINCEY (cont'd) Domingo thought you might be the one who went rat on him. Quincey looks at Colette QUINCEY (cont'd) So I brought in a rat of my own. Danny looks at Colette, dumbfounded.</context>
      <utterance>The cops came. But they didn't find nothing. Turns out their C.I. game 'em some bad information. Quincey holds up the baggie of drugs.</utterance>
   <speaker>DANNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You set me up?</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Danny can't help from laughing at the irony. Beads of sweat are forming on his blanched face. He looks at Colette with a wry smile.</context>
      <utterance>Bitch played you like a squeezebox, Romeo.</utterance>
   <speaker>DANNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're good, princess. I'll give you that.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLETTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Danny looks down at his bloody stomach.</context>
      <utterance>Danny, it's not what you think.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLETTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Danny stares at her, not sure what to believe. He looks over at Quincey.</context>
      <utterance>I owed them money ... a lot of money ... they didn't give me a choice. You know how it works. When I got to know you, I tried to back out ... that's when they did this ...  But I told them I wouldn't do it .. I didn't want to see you get hurt.</utterance>
   <speaker>DANNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Quincey shakes his head.</context>
      <utterance>She selling me a bill, home boy?</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nah, she ain't lying. She took a pretty good beating from you, ace. I seen grown men crack after a lot less. But not this bitch.  It was very touching.</utterance>
   <speaker>DANNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then why are we here?</utterance>
   <speaker>COLETTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Danny looks at Colette, imagining the awful beating she must have taken.</context>
      <utterance>They threatened to kill my daughter.  I had no choice.  I'm sorry, Danny.</utterance>
   <speaker>DANNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>UNDER THE BED - THE CARPET IGNITES. The fire spreads quickly.</context>
      <utterance>It's okay. It's okay.   God damn, you're beautiful.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Jesus. Quincey grabs her arm. QUINCEY  Let's go.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLETTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The drapes go up in flames. Quincey puts the gun to the back of her head.</context>
      <utterance>No!</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You wanna die here with him or come with me?</utterance>
   <speaker>DANNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Colette, go.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLETTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't want to leave you.</utterance>
   <speaker>DANNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The fire continues to spread. Colette kisses Danny on the lips. Quincey pulls her away. Collette looks back one last time just as the flames reach the door, cutting off any escape. Danny breathing hard. He gets up. Staggers over to the mirror where his trumpet is. He opens the case and takes the trumpet out. He plops down on the bed and BLOWS A FEW NOTES. He stops for a second, a smile on his lips. He starts to play SAETA.</context>
      <utterance>Your daughter needs you. Go.</utterance>

   <speaker>DANNY</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Emerging from the flames into a dark hallway. Danny's eyes flutter as he seemingly continues to float. DANNY (cont'd) Am I dead? A linoleum floor rushes underneath. DANNY (cont'd) Linoleum. This must be hell. Danny head sags, finds himself staring at ... ... A TATTOED LIKENESS OF HIMSELF. The tattoo smiles and speaks.</context>
      <utterance>Oh shit. What is this?</utterance>
   <speaker>TATTO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stairs rush by underneath. Then another hallway. DANNY'S P.O.V. - a bright white light at the end of the hall. DANNY (cont'd) Oh no. What a fucking clich. On Danny's face, floating through the hall. His eyes fluttering. MOVING TOWARDS the light. Closer. Closer. Danny's eyes close, his head droops.</context>
      <utterance>Hang in there buddy.</utterance>
