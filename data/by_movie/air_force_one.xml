      <context>The applause dies as Marshall begins to speak.</context>

      <context>Applause from the audience. Marshall turns the page on his speech.</context>
      <utterance>As you know, three weeks ago American Special Forces, in cooperation with the Russian Republican Army, secured the arrest of Turkmenistan's self- proclaimed dictator, General Ivan Stravanavitch, whose brutal sadistic reign had given new meaning to the word horror. I am proud to say our operation was a success.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARSHALL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>During the applause, Marshall pulls a page from the speech, folds it and slides it into his pocket. He removes his glasses and looks out into the crowd. His tone becomes more personal. He's not reciting the speech anymore.</context>
      <utterance>And now, yesterday's biggest threat to world peace... today awaits trial for crimes against humanity.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARSHALL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Terror is not a legitimate system of government. And to those who commit the atrocities I say, we will no longer tolerate, we will no longer negotiate, and we will no longer be afraid. It's your turn to be afraid. Applause rolls through the crowd.</context>
      <utterance>What we did here was important. We finally pulled our heads out of the sand, we finally stood up to the brutality and said We've had enough. Every time we ignore these atrocities-- the rapes, the death squads, the genocides- every time we negotiate with these, these thugs to keep them out of gig country and away from gig families, every time we do thiS.E. we legitimize terror.</utterance>

      <utterance>Criminal. One of our boys died in Marshall's little publicity stunt and for what? So we could claim victory over another country's problems instead of our own?
