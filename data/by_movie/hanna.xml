      <context>HANNA spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings her fist right to ERIK's face. He blocks and thumps an open palm on to HANNA's shoulder sending her sprawling into the snow. She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims a kick at her head. She dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for her pistol. ERIK slaps the hand away.</context>

HANNA clips ERIK'S temple sending him to the ground. She wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap... ... but she can't. He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow. ERIK stands and wipes the snow from his pants. His face shows a touch of frustration. He plods into the forest.</context>
