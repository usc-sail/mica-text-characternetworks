      <context>He starts driving.</context>
      <utterance>Le Mondial. Tres bien.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un moment. L'autoroute est ferme. A cause du 14 Juillet. He drives for a while.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed looks at the meter, francs are clicking away. He also looks at the cab driver's license, his name is Moises Du Bois.</context>
      <utterance>[Do you mind the radio?]</utterance>
   <speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>[Do you want me to turn the radio off?]</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The driver turns around.</context>
      <utterance>I don't speak French.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ah. American?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's right.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed nods.</context>
      <utterance>That's good because I speak a little English.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed shakes his head "no".</context>
      <utterance>I asked if you mind the radio. Music. You know.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed adjusts his watch.</context>
      <utterance>Super cool.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>What time is it?</utterance>
   <speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed forgets the adjustment for now.</context>
      <utterance>Time, time, time. I don't know. Daytime.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Are you in town for business?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>

   <speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's a nice hotel. Your hotel. Very big rooms. He looks at Zed in the rear view mirror.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do you know Paris?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The cab driver smiles.</context>
      <utterance>I've been here once before. When I was younger.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They drive for a while.</context>
      <utterance>Those were the days.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker>

      <utterance>Married?</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>No.  Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He lifts his hand and shows his index and middle finger tightly extended together, then he crosses them.</context>
      <utterance>Well, if you need a wife for the night...  Une escorte. Pour vous faire visiter.  For business. I give you my number. Very nice girl. French. Like when you were young.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed smiles at this and nods.</context>
      <utterance>Know what I mean?</utterance>
   <speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Speaks the language of love. Take you to heaven and back. You just tell me and I set it up. Zed shakes his head and laughs.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAB DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed can do nothing but smile at the thought of it.</context>
      <utterance>What you laughing at? You let Moises set it up. She treat you right. She treat you fine.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>He points to the telephone.</context>
      <utterance>Your package...It arrived in the last night of before last night.</utterance>
   <speaker>BELLBOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He motions toward the bathroom.</context>
      <utterance>Ah...telephone, for the room service.</utterance>
   <speaker>BELLBOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He opens the closet door.</context>
      <utterance>The toilet.</utterance>
   <speaker>BELLBOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He points to a control console next to the bed.</context>
      <utterance>To hang the clothes.</utterance>
   <speaker>BELLBOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed reaches into his pocket and takes out some French money, he starts fingering through it. Then, the bellboy takes the liberty of showing Zed which bills to give him.</context>
      <utterance>From here you can operate the television. Then he pauses at the door before he goes out.</utterance>
   <speaker>BELLBOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He starts to leave.</context>
      <utterance>Merci.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The bellboy turns around.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, wait.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What time is it?</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Time.</utterance>
   <speaker>BELLBOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The bellboy clicks his heels and walks out the door. Zed looks around the room, still wondering what time it is, and takes a seat on the bed. Obviously tired from the flight Zed unbuttons his shirt a bit and lays back on the bed next to the package. Before he dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on the bedside table. He is asleep.</context>
      <utterance>Ah. Yes. Il est presque huit heures moins dix.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Bonjour.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed opens up the door and lets her in. She checks out the room and places her bag on the bed. Then she makes her way to the window for a view of the city.</context>
      <utterance>Bonjour.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She turns to him, but in the process takes the time to examine every detail of the room.</context>
      <utterance>Wow. Vous avez une belle chambre. Je ne suis jamais venue dans cet hotel.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ca sera 150 francs de l'heure. Toute la nuit pour 700. D'avance. Et faudra porter un--</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She blows a bubble.</context>
      <utterance>I...don't speak French.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She takes a seat on the bed.</context>
      <utterance>It's okay.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed takes the money out of his wallet and gives it to her.</context>
      <utterance>It will be one thousand francs for all night. In advance.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We can do it now if you want.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, let me just dry up.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He goes into the bathroom and starts drying himself. She puts the money in her bag and then turns on the television from the remote console. A French talk show comes on. She changes the channel until she comes to a station playing F.W. Murnau's silent classic, "Nosferatu". She smiles and sits back to watch.</context>
      <utterance>Okay, but it's not necessary.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's your name?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Zoe or Zoey. Which ever you like.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>My name's Zed.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She notices his pants.</context>
      <utterance>What was that?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You can take those off. The pants.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'd rather watch you get undressed first.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She stands up and starts to lift her top off. He stops her.</context>
      <utterance>Alright.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She stands there looking at him and then smiles.</context>
      <utterance>Slower. He lays down on the bed.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Then, with Zed laying on the bed and watching her, she slowly, seductively strips in front of him, never taking her eyes from his eyes, until she is totally naked.</context>
      <utterance>Alright Mister America. Zed.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Then, like a cat prowling for it's prey, she crawls over the bed to him and begins to unbuckle his pants. She removes the pants and climbs on top of him. They begin to make love. On the television, "Nosferatu" silently plays. Zoey and Zed quicken their pace with an urgency one can't resist during a moment of passion. She cries out and lowers herself to his grasp. An IMAGE overcomes her mind. They quicken to an almost violent speed and then expire, both satisfied. She begins to kiss him multiple times over the face.</context>
      <utterance>Slow enough for you?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She rolls over, still hugging him, purring like a kitten. They rest there for a while...holding each other.</context>
      <utterance>C'etait formidable.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She takes the covers and crawls under them, so does Zed.</context>
      <utterance>I'm cold.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Zed?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Moises told me you were in town for business.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What kind of business?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't know. I'm just curious.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do you ask all your clients questions?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No. Just the ones I like.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So you like me?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Because you're...a good person. I run into some real creeps. You know.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How do you know I'm a good person?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Body language. We fit together.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All men and women fit together. Hell, even some men fit together.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, but you know, we clicked. You made me orgasm. Do you know how often I orgasm with a man Moises sets me up with?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No I don't.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Usually never. They're almost always fat like pigs. Zed laughs at this.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And you make me feel safe. That's something more important than the orgasm. An integral part maybe of the orgasm.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I never really thought of it like that.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed nods at this.</context>
      <utterance>Well, it's true.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed reaches over and turns it off from the console.</context>
      <utterance>Turn off the television.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So I mean it when I tell you Zed, I like you very much.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I like you too Zoe.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He nods.</context>
      <utterance>Honest?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed stares ahead as he thinks of an answer.</context>
      <utterance>Why? For the same reason? Any man can orgasm. Even with his own hand.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She doesn't like the sound of this. She slaps him.</context>
      <utterance>Well, I like your honesty. You're open. Unlike most prostitutes I've been with.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed is a little surprised at this.</context>
      <utterance>I am not a prostitute!</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Really? Can I have my francs back then?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm a student. And to pay for the classes I became an escort. It's my choice to sleep with you.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I see.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What? You don't understand.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, I do.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, it's not easy.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I didn't say it was.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm here because I want to.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Okay, okay relax. What school do you go to?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The Centre du Art, Paris.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's really interesting. What kind of art do you study?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not any of the old shit.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She rolls onto her back and stares into an imaginary world as she talks to Zed.</context>
      <utterance>I have a day job too. Three times a week.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But someday there will be only my art.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What kind of things do you paint?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She looks back at him.</context>
      <utterance>I don't paint. I make things. Objects. Not like sculpture. Like life...but with no narrative. I want when someone looks at one of my objects for there to be no reference to the world. Void of feeling, emotion...void of destiny. Those are left for me. They belong only to me. If someone else can see into it...then it is no longer mine. I have failed. And I would destroy it. I don't care how much cash they would offer me. It would be shit. I can't tell you how many objects of mine have been destroyed. They told too much about me. And if someone wants to know something about me...I'll tell them myself. The way I'm telling you.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What I do I do only for the objects.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'd like to see one of these.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He decides to put a stop to this once and for all.</context>
      <utterance>What? So you could see the work of a whore?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Zoey. I'm sorry for calling you a prostitute. I didn't understand the difference.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The difference is a prostitute would have lied to you about her orgasm. He gives her a kiss.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If these things you make are as true as you are...I'm sure they're as indescribable. Perhaps, someday, you'll make one...about me.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZOEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed is unable to speak. They look into each others eyes for a long moment, hearing the sounds of the city drift in through the window. Then she leans forward and gives him a soft understanding kiss.</context>
      <utterance>If I do...you'll never know which one it is. Because I'll be the only one who understands. I'll be the only one who can look into it and see where in my life it came from.</utterance>

His eyes roll back into his head. He looks like he's on the verge of falling asleep. Then Jean takes another snort. Pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high, shooting up, and drinking more beer. Then Jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some heroin in it.</context>

      <utterance>[Do you know one?]</utterance>
   <speaker>RICARDO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>[Let's see. Okay. An unfortunate fellow was locked up in prison doing five to ten for armed robbery. All he could think of the whole time was eating pussy.] Zoey looks up at them telling the joke.</utterance>
   <speaker>RICARDO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>[The day finally came for his release. He walked out of the prison with a new suit and fifty francs the officials had given him, and made a bee-line for the whorehouse in the nearest town. Slamming his fifty francs on the front desk, he said, "I wanna eat some pussy."] Jean is already laughing.</utterance>
   <speaker>RICARDO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zoey glances at all of the people. Then her eyes lock with the concierge security guard.</context>
      <utterance>[I'm not done. Listen. "Where've you been," said the greasy fellow behind the desk, "fifty francs won't get you a close look these days."]</utterance>
   <speaker>RICARDO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The concierge security guard lifts his pant leg slowly.</context>
      <utterance>["Listen buddy," said the ex-convict, pulling him out of his chair by the shirt collar, "I wanna eat some pussy, and I want it now!"]</utterance>
   <speaker>RICARDO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zoey notices that on the concierge security guard's leg is an ankle holster with a small .38 pistol on it. His fingers begin to unsnap the safety harness on it. Her eyes widen.</context>
      <utterance>["Okay, okay," gasped the proprietor, "I'll see what I can do." So the ex-con followed him through to the very back of the warehouse through some stained, tattered red curtains, and into a grimy little room where a bedraggled looking whore lay spreadeagled on a filthy bed. "She's yours for fifty francs," said the proprietor, and the fellow went at it.]</utterance>
   <speaker>RICARDO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The concierge security guard unsnaps the safety. Zoey knows he's going to make his move.</context>
      <utterance>[After a little while, he came across a piece of egg. "That's funny," he thought to himself, "I don't think I had egg for breakfast." But he spat it out and kept eating away. Next he found a piece of chipped beef wedged between his front teeth. "I'm sure I haven't eaten chipped beef this week," he thought, but kept on. Then he came across the corn. "What is this?" he said, "I think I'm going to be sick."]</utterance>
   <speaker>RICARDO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Before they can even laugh the concierge security guard whips out the .38 and fires three shots. Two of them hit Ricardo in the chest. He falls to the ground. The other hits Francois in the arm. In an instant Jean is firing his machine gun into the group of people huddled on the floor. Everyone is screaming and trying to get away. Machine gun fire cuts through the concierge security guard killing him dead. Unfortunately, the wild spray of bullets also rips into three of the tellers, four of the customers, and the loan officer, killing them all. People are trying to flee but Claude fires his gun into the ceiling.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>He slashes Zed across the face with the switchblade. Zed falls backwards and tumbles down the stairs like a rag doll.</context>
      <utterance>Shit Zed. I haven't seen you in years. You hardly know me.</utterance>
   <speaker>ERIC</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Eric walks into the back office. The others look at each other. Suddenly a black figure runs across the bank behind the shadows, Francois sees it and nervously fires. In the background the distinctive sound of European police sirens wail as more cars pull up to the outside of the bank. Also, an UNINTELLIGIBLE VOICE is blaring orders over a bullhorn.</context>
      <utterance>Now let's try to get out of here.</utterance>
   <speaker>FRANCOIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly all of them start firing like blindly into the smoke. Francois runs back to Eric who has walked up to the elevator via the back office.</context>

   <speaker>ERIC</speaker>

      <context>Zed rushes Eric and Zoey starts scratching. Eric drops the gun but quickly whips out his knife. She tries to get away from Eric but he has a hold on her shirt. Eric swipes at her with the knife and grazes he back. Then Eric slashes toward Zed who jumps back. Zoey falls to the floor.</context>
      <utterance>Oh but you're wrong. This is my way out. This dime store couge with her motor driven ass. You find your own.</utterance>

   <speaker>ERIC</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He swipes and Zed grabs a hold of the knife by the blade. Eric pulls it free and the knife falls to the floor. Zed takes this opportunity and kicks Eric in the face. Eric reaches for the knife. Zed, his hand bloody, dives onto Eric. Zoey also jumps onto them and starts yanking on Eric's hair. She plunges her nails into his face.</context>
      <utterance>I will kill you. And once I kill you Zed, I'll get out of here. I'll fuck your bitch up the ass and give her AIDS...if she doesn't already have it. What do you say to that Zed?</utterance>
   <speaker>ERIC</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zed is rabbit punching Eric from underneath. Then, Eric grabs a hold of Zed's balls and squeezes. Zed lets out a shrill scream. Eric starts elbowing Zoey in the face. The three of them lay there on the floor wriggling like worms, unable to move because each is putting the other through such agony. Then, Oliver, shot up and bloody haplessly stumbles into the room. His body is a mass of bullet wounds.</context>
      <utterance>Fucking bitch!</utterance>
   <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He clumsily falls dead to the ground, his shotgun slides near Zoey, Zed, and Eric. The sight of the gun gives Eric the strength only a madman could posses. He rolls over and throws Zoey off him. Then, he smashes his forehead into Zed's nose, bursting it. Eric, deftly, rolls over and grabs the gun. He gets to his feet and cocks the pump action.</context>

   <speaker>ERIC</speaker>
