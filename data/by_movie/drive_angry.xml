      <context>Followers gather, move in unison, dance, writhe, fuck. Tattoo approaches with an old rusty knife. It was probably elegant once. Now it is worthless. He hands it to Jonah. The Followers GASP in holy awe.</context>
      <utterance>My brothers and sisters, we have come so far. To this place where the dying earth bleeds its corrupt soul at our feet. From its death, it shall be reborn. As we will be. We who have survived the slings. The arrows. The revulsion of those too weak to believe. We have been cast out. And hunted. But no more.</utterance>
