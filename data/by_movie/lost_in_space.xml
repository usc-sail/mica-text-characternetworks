      <context>Will turns in time to see the core cylinder sink into the control panel, the laser exploding in intensity below them as it drains the cylinder's radioactive power. The world begins to EXPLODE.</context>

      <context>John stares at him.</context>
      <utterance>You could have taken the core and left before it was too late. You saved me instead.</utterance>

      <context>THE LASER-CLOSE. Reaches full power. The image in the time pool stabilizes, becoming clear. TIME POOL-CLOSE. Mission Control the day before the launch. Father and Son stare into the past, eyes filled with wonder.</context>

      <context>TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. The Jupiter Two tries in vain to dodge the fire geysers, then EXPLODING all over again. Will enters some commands. TIME BUBBLE-CLOSE. The image in the portal begins to run backwards, the Jupiter Two reconstituting from a ball of flame, receding past diminishing flame geysers, beginning to land again.</context>
      <utterance>All I could see was your need to go forward at any cost. What you never showed me was your love. I lost that. Robbed by time. I could never see how much you cared. Until now.</utterance>
