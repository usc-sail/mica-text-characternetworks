Warden Iger nods to TWO GUARDS manning the LETHAL INJECTION MACHINE, on which EIGHT OVERSIZED GLASS CYLINDERS in a vertical row are the main feature, filled with various clear liquids. There are two switches -- one a dummy, the other live (no way to know which is which). The guards power up the machine. Lights activate on the board. Each man grabs a switch, waits. Nick watches the wall clock. It hits 7 o'clock. The warden nods and the guards flick their switches, quickly leaving the room. The warden follows them out, closes the door. We hear the pumps quietly activate. Rupert is taking shallow breaths, terrified...then lays back to wait. PLUNGER ONE slowly descends, emptying its contents into the I.V. lines... Rupert sags as the fast-acting barbiturate spreads through his veins...his breathing slows...his head drops back... he loses consciousness... PLUNGER TWO depresses, sending the second vial of liquid into the I.V. lines with a quiet whir of pumps...</context>
      <utterance>I did wrong too. I guess I'll pay up. But it was always him sayin' jump and how high, and I just went along. Now he's killin' me and he got you people to do it. And that's a shame. A goddamn shame. And...  ...and I guess that's all.</utterance>

   <speaker>SPOOK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>In my line, we use an aptitude profile based on chess. A tournament- level player like you can think five to eight steps ahead of an average player, did you know that? Me, I think about ten steps ahead, so I'd take you in a game.</utterance>

The three of them stand there absorbing everything they've heard. Nick sits on a step. Quiet looks are traded... ...and they all start taking off their ties...</context>
      <utterance>There's this tie -- we call it the Albert, after Albert DeSalvo. They tiptoe in one night, thread a piano wire with a ratchet gizmo into one of your ties. Sounds crazy, but trust me it works. You put your tie on and all day long it slowly tightens. You don't even notice it's cutting off the blood-flow to your brain. Then you drop dead. Brain-dead or plain dead, doesn't much matter at that point.  Clyde invented that.</utterance>

      <utterance>No, we got tripwires. We open this lid, instant karma's gonna get us.  Don't see a motion sensor. Trigger looks simple...dial a cell phone, incoming call arms the trigger -- trigger's set to count down from forty seconds, then boom.  That call comes in, we have forty seconds to get as far away from this thing as possible.</utterance>

      <utterance>Beautiful how you played us. Getting yourself tossed into solitary -- pre-rigged with exits from all five cells. Whichever one we put you in, you had your bases covered.  I thought I was such a bad-ass putting you down here. Turns out I was doing what you wanted.</utterance>
