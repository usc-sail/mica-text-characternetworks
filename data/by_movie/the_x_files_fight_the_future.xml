On an adjacent skyscraper is what appears to be AN FBI AGENT in an ID windbreaker exiting onto the roof. CAMERA CONTINUING AROUND into A CLOSE UP PROFILE of S.A.C Michaud.

      <utterance>Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost -- Scully, engrossed in her own argument, realizes she's been the only one speaking for the last short while. She stops walking.</utterance>

      <utterance>They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Scully pulls out an autopsy report that was laid on the gurney under the body of the sheet-wrapped corpse.</context>
      <utterance>I can tell you that without even looking at him.  Conclusive organ failure due to proximal exposure to source and flying debris.</utterance>
   <speaker>SCULLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Undeterred, Mulder works to get the sheet off. The first thing we notice is that he's still in his fireman's uniform. His face looks familiar to us, not because we know him, but because of the translucency of skin we saw in the other fireman. (We will also notice he's missing an arm, a leg and large part of his torso.)</context>
      <utterance>This body has already been autopsied, Mulder. You can tell from the way it's been wrapped and dressed.</utterance>
   <speaker>MULDER</speaker>

   <speaker>SCULLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?</utterance>
   <speaker>MULDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.</utterance>
   <speaker>KURTZWEIL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.

   <speaker>WELL-MANICURED MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The force and conviction of his delivery leave Mulder shaken.</context>
      <utterance>Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?</utterance>
   <speaker>WELL-MANICURED MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.</utterance>

   <speaker>WELL-MANICURED MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This draws a look back in the mirror from the Driver.</context>
      <utterance>Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have.</utterance>

      <utterance>The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.</utterance>

      <context>Mulder reaching to this as the limo pulls to a stop. Trying the door, but the door is locked. When he turns back to the W.M.M. he has produced a handgun, which is now pointing at Mulder. Laid casually across a folded arm. Mulder reacts on seeing it.</context>
      <utterance>Driver.</utterance>
   <speaker>WELL-MANICURED MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mulder is recoiling as he says this. Then, without hesitation in one quick move, he SHOOTS the Driver in the head. The blood spattering on the front windshield -- and on Mulder who has barely had a chance to react.</context>
      <utterance>The men I work with will stop at nothing to clear the way for what they believe is their stake in the inevitable future. I was ordered to kill Kurtzweil. A necessary action to protect my grandchildren's lives.  I might just as easily kill you.</utterance>

      <context>Mulder looks at The Well-Manicured Man, expecting to be next. And for a moment, we do too. But the W.M.M. simply opens the door and steps out of the car. Holding the door open for Mulder who is still frozen by the actions that went just before.</context>
