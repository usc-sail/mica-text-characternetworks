I let it happen. I've lived so much of my life with nothing. When you have no money, you have no choices. I don't care what they say -- money is freedom.

   <speaker>MATTY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She turns to her husband. He is not what Racine expected. He may, in fact, be mean, as Matty described him, but he looks neither small nor weak. A handsome man, he is bigger than Racine and in terrific shape. Dressed in an expensive summer suit, he radiates vigor and controlled physical power. He wears sleek, metal-framed glasses.</context>

      <utterance>Mr. Racine is the lawyer I told you about.  You remember. He had a client who wanted to buy the house. I told him we weren't selling.</utterance>

      <context>The Hostess nods and leads the way. Walker gestures Matty ahead, then puts a big hand behind Racine's elbow and ushers him into the dining room.</context>

      <utterance>Yes, she is. I'm crazy about her. If I ever thought she was seeing another guy... I don't know.  I'd understand how it could happen. Her being the way she is. I'd understand it. But I think I'd kill the guy with my bare hands.</utterance>
   <speaker>RACINE</speaker>

      <context>Walker looks at Racine and laughs. As he begins to speak, he focuses intently on Racine. He seems to be trying to communicate something other than what he's saying.</context>
      <utterance>That's understanding.</utterance>
   <speaker>WALKER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Again Walker takes off his glasses. He holds them up to the light and then rubs them again with his handkerchief.</context>
      <utterance>You wouldn't believe the dorkus she was with when I met her. The guy came to us with a business proposition. We're always looking for opportunities. If the conditions are right. We're willing to take an occasional risk, if the downside isn't too steep. But this guy hadn't done his homework, he didn't know the bottom line. That's how I knew he was full of shit. You've got to know the bottom line. That's all that really counts.</utterance>
   <speaker>WALKER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He puts his glasses back on, stares at Racine.</context>
      <utterance>He didn't have the goods, this guy. He was like a lot of guys you run into -- they want to get rich, they want to do it quick, they want to be there with one score.</utterance>

I know this, though, her mother has worked plenty hard to keep Heather on Edmund's mind, Always bringing her around, reporting everything she does in school. That Roz is a smart one.

Every little change would mean a lot to us, End. You're a lawyer. You know how to write it. It wouldn't seem so odd.

      <context>Suddenly, Racine bursts from the hall closet, the wooden plank raised above his head. He brings it down fast toward Edmund's head. Edmund reacts instinctively, raising his arm, the arm that holds the gun, to protect himself. The wooden plank smashes down -- half its force taken by Edmund's forearm, half by his head. The gun BLASTS once. One small window in the front door shatters and the bullet continues into the night. Edmund's revolver slides across the hall floor into a corner. Edmund is on the floor, blood pouring from his scalp. But he is coming on like a crazed beast. His glasses askew, but still on his head, he has grasped Racine around the legs. With a powerful lunge, he pulls Racine's legs out. Racine crashes to the hall floor, losing the wooden plank. Matty, frozen at the stair railing, cries out. Edmund is pulling Racine toward him with all his might, crawling up Racine's body as they both slide on the wood floor. Edmund reaches out one huge hand, and pulls Racine even closer. Racine puts his left hand into Edmund's face, his thumb flat against the lens of Edmund's glasses and pushes his head back. The glasses fly away and Racine loses his hold. Edmund comes on. Racine's right hand gropes -- gropes -- finds the wooden plank. He swings it up. The wooden plank describes a perfect arc into our view, and then out, finding its mark with a HORRIBLE THUD. Matty, up the stairs, turns away. Racine falls back on the floor.</context>

      <context>Racine nods.</context>
      <utterance>Mrs. Walker explained to me that when she and her husband decided to make some minor changes, they just took care of it up here for simplicity's sake. And, indeed, as you know, the new will is almost identical to the old but for the disposition of a few items.  At the risk of oversimplifying, the thrust of the will is to divide the estate in almost equal parts between Heather Kraft and Mrs. Walker. Would you agree with that assessment, Mr. Racine?</utterance>

      <context>Matty turns a confused look to Roz who returns it sympathetically. Hardin notes it.</context>
      <utterance>It's a small thing, but it's the law. It forbids an inheritance to be passed down indefinitely for generations. Many general practitioner lawyers don't fully understand it. It doesn't come up much for them, because wills this complex are usually handled by estate departments in larger firms. Handled by lawyers who specialize in this type of work.</utterance>

      <context>Racine watches him, his mind racing ahead too fast to bother being insulted. Lowenstein can't help a small, wincing smile. Now Hardin gets to his payoff and there is no amusement in his tone.</context>
      <utterance>I know this is terribly confusing, but if you'll bear with me... I spotted the problem right away, but since Edmund's intent was clear, I thought it in everyone's best interest to try and get the will admitted into probate anyway, even though it was technically incorrect. I knew that a probate judge in Miami would spot the mistake right away. That's all they do all day, they're expert. So I thought I'd bring it up here to Okeelanta County -- since Edmund had the residence here -- and see if I could get lucky with a judge who didn't know estate law quite so well...  Perhaps find one with the same kind of training as Mr. Racine.</utterance>

Whatever's the evilest thing you can think of me now, I did worse things then. There's nothing lower than the animal I was then. Worse than you can imagine. I thought I would die. I prayed I would... And then a man helped me. He got me clean. He didn't want much in return, either... He was a lawyer and he put me to work in his office. I learned a lot there. One time I even thought I might go to law school. ... That's where I picked up the business about making a will invalid. That happened to him once. I swear I would never have used that if I'd known about your case... I was afraid to tell you, Ned. I knew you wouldn't let me do it. I'm greedy, like you said.

      <context>Racine swivels in his chair so that he can see Beverly in the reception room. Beverly is just replacing the receiver on the hook and for a moment, she gives Racine a strange, ambivalent look. Racine watches her as she goes back to work and speaks quietly into the phone.</context>
