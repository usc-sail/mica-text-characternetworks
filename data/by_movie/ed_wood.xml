      <utterance>Ed, you seem like a nice kid, but look around you...  I don't hire directors with burning desires to tell their stories. I make movies like "Chained Girls."

      <context>The bartender nonchalantly pours a shot. Ed takes the drink. He quietly sips his booze and reflects upon his day. Ed glances around. And then, suddenly -- his eyes widen. Sitting at a table is ORSON WELLES! The portly, world-famous filmmaker sits alone, eating lunch with one hand and drawing STORYBOARDS with the other. Ed is thunderstruck.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ed is astonished.</context>
      <utterance>Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else. But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.</utterance>

      <utterance>It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch? "Kane." The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?</utterance>
