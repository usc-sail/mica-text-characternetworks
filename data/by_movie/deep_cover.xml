      <utterance>Yes, sir.</utterance>

      <context>Joe Jr. stares, silent; Joe Jr.'s about to hit him.</context>

   <speaker>JOE STEVENS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <context>A sudden charm to his bravado. Joe Jr. smiles uncertainly. Joe Sr. grins back, pulls up in front of a liquor store.</context>

   <speaker>JOE JR.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <context>A real DRUG DEALER joins the cop. UNDERCOVER COP: "You got it?" DEALER: "In the motel, right over here..." The Cop's uneasy, keeps glancing back toward the CAMERA as they go.</context>
      <utterance>You can tell he's a cop? Stevens laughs: it's obvious.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVENS</speaker>

      <utterance>Then why's he taking him to the room?</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVENS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Carver studies Stevens in the darkness, impressed. ON SCREEN: The figures disappear into the motel. We hear their voices. DEALER: "Here, try some of it." UNDERCOVER COP: "Uhh... No, I don't..." DEALER: "Why not, you sonofabitch?" Two bursts of SOUND DISTORTION. A plainclothes cop, TAFT, (black, stocky, powerful) bolts from behind the CAMERA, sprints toward the motel. The CAMERA wobbles after him.</context>
      <utterance>To rip him off.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVENS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ON SCREEN: The CAMERA (jerky, hand-held) nears the open motel door. Taft is bent over the Undercover Cop's body.</context>
      <utterance>Too late.</utterance>
   <speaker>TAFT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He slams the wall, starts past the CAMERA. Carver pushes the pause button; the tape freezes on a jerky image of Taft's face.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, Bobby... Jesus, Jesus...  Get an ambulance -- and back up. Now!</utterance>

   <speaker>CARVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Charles Taft. LAPD Narcotics.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVENS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's a good cop.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Carver watches Stevens watch Taft, smiles at something.</context>
      <utterance>He's a great cop. Two [names citation] and a [another citation]. As tough as they come and twice as honest.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVENS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He opens a manila envelope, dumps the contents on the desk: driver's license, social security card, high school transcript, prison records... all in the name of William G. Hull. No photos.</context>
      <utterance>But the cops aren't getting it done here, are they? Gotta try something new...</utterance>

      <utterance>Who's John Hull?</utterance>
   <speaker>CARVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You are. If you want to be.  Most undercover guys don't know what they're doing because it's a day gig.  I need somebody who goes under and stays there; six months, a year, five years...</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVENS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What does he have to do?</utterance>
   <speaker>CARVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Buy drugs. Sell drugs. Feed me information.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVENS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's a snitch.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's a drug dealer. A criminal. A scumbag. But for the right side.  I want you to come to Los Angeles on loan to the Justice Department as a federal agent. Your experience there will be credited toward your seniority here. And you'll come back to Cleveland a P3 or higher.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVENS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I can't do that. I've got a wife and kids.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stevens takes a breath: this is awkward to explain.</context>
      <utterance>You're separated from your wife, she's filled for divorce. You see your kids every other weekend.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVENS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All my life I've stayed away from that stuff. I've never touched drugs.</utterance>

      <utterance>Come on, a little grass...?</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVENS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not grass. Not nothing. I never even had a drink.  Never have, never will. You don't understand. I made a choice in my life.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's to understand? You saw your father killed when you were ten, and you decided you wouldn't be like that.  I'm God, I know everything. You wanted to be a good boy, so you became a cop. Hiding out in uniform... That's why you got the hard-on for Taft.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVENS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's not that simple.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll tell the truth, Joe. You're never going to be a Taft.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVENS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But he does.</context>
      <utterance>I don't believe that.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You ever take a look at your psychological profile? You score almost like a criminal.  "Resents authority..."</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVENS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I do not.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>"...Exaggerated moral standards, but with no underlying value system." Look at the anger, the repressed violence, it's almost off the scale...</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVENS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Carver hands him the scores which are, of course, just clusters of numbers. Stevens is upset, though oddly unsurprised, as if this only confirmed his secret fears.</context>
      <utterance>Let me see that...</utterance>
   <speaker>CARVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why'd you join the force?</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I wanted to be of use.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Indicates dead body on TV.</context>
      <utterance>Well, now you can be. You won't be Taft, but maybe you'll be something more... interesting.  There's a man named Ramon Gallegos who supplies 60% of the cocaine to the West Coast. He's smart, smooth, and sufficiently elusive that we don't even have an adult photograph of him. However, his uncle is Hector Guzman, an important Latin American political figure. Gallegos uses Uncle's connections to get product into the country, and everyone we've sent after him has ended up like that...</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why would I be different?</utterance>
   <speaker>CARVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stevens raises his eyebrows: what?</context>
      <utterance>You already are, that's the point...  You've got the ability and the personality to go underground and blend in completely. That's what the others couldn't. Some part of them showed. That's why they're dead. See, there's only one rule in this game.</utterance>
