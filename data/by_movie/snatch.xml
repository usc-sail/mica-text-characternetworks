      <utterance>The Septuagint scholars mistranslated the Hebrew word for "young woman" in to the Greek word for "virgin", because they thought they looked the same, coming up with the prophecy "behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son". But there is a world of difference between a virgin and a young woman like there is between a Volante and a fuckin Vantage.</utterance>

This has the unfortunate consequence of taking Vinny with it. Poor Vin is shot straight to the ceiling, all we can see is half a body and his desperately searching for ground legs. Needless to say this leaves Sol in a bit of a bewildered state. He's looking the wrong way at the critical moment and is left wondering what happened, not having seen Vince impaled on the ceiling.

There is no going back. Sol starts to kick the glass door, but it doesn't budge. With panic rising swiftly, Sol doesn't fuck around he takes aim with the handgun and fires, the bullet shatters the glass but it doesn't break through, and the bullet now ricochets off both glass doors shattering bullet-proof glass all around them. Vinny's panic filled eyes attempt to follow its trajectory. Sol is unaware of the ricochet and before Vin has time to warn him, Sol fires another bullet. Now he observes the problem and waits for the inevitable. The bullet tears through the bag of coins, which then empties its contents at Vin's and Sol's feet. Eventually the bullet hits poor Vince in the thigh. Sol sinks to the floor, he has given up. Amongst the yells emanating from Vince we can hear Sol's pathetic and desperate whimpering.</context>

Tyrone slides the blade into Errol 's ribs and Errol fires a shot straight at Tyrone. The bullet passes through Tyrone and hits John in the throat . Vin, Lincoln and Sol are left wondering what the fuck has just happened .</context>
      <utterance>It's because of stories. I am sure you've heard one or two of those stories. For example, did you hear about the three black fellas that did a very bad thing, however they made some effort to redeem that very bad thing, so the governor saw fit not to kill em. He thought it would be a more advantageous concept to let them kill each other and let the survivor live to tell the tale. That way everybody wins, well, all except the two that died of course.</utterance>

   <speaker>THE REFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We drift again into Micky's pov, his world is becoming more and more surreal. He can faintly hear Turkish whispering words to him, but he's not really listening. A bell comes from somewhere, and Micky instinctively walks to the center of the ring. "Good night" is already there, they pace one another for a second or two, Micky avoids a punch or two and then he takes a hard one and he knows it, we flash to white, Micky's in trouble: he lets one of his missiles go and BANG it shakes "good night" to his core, all goes quiet. We go to super slow motion: his knees buckle and "good night" is in trouble. Micky maintains a frown as he watches his opponent's knees threaten to betray him. The crowd tries to digest what is happening. After a period of silence reality dawns. Brick Top mouths the words in silence."Don1t go down you fucker". The crowd wants Micky to finish the job. But common sense reins back the coup de grace. "Good night" eventually regains control of his legs and stumbles forward, after a few sleepy punches he starts to provide a serious onslaught.</context>
      <utterance>Alright lads no eye gouging no biting. Do your worst. Back to your corners.</utterance>
   <speaker>TURKISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This goes on for two rounds (which is montage down to a few seconds). We go in the mind of poor Micky. We break the music just as it's starting to look dangerous... The bell goes and Micky walks to the wrong corner. Turkish pulls him back to his corner.</context>
      <utterance>I don't like the look of this Tommy, bring the van up to the back door.</utterance>
   <speaker>TURKISH</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Micky goes out again his hands are low, BANG there is a flash of white as Micky goes down in the dirt. Dust rises from where he fell. He gets up quickly, his hands are still low, BANG he goes down again, in no time he's up.</context>
      <utterance>They are on ya. You got to hurt him Micky. Otherwise we are rumbled.... you hear me Micky? Do -something, it looks like it' s rigged.</utterance>

      <context>Turkish pulls Micky away. It's not as hard as it might be trying to get out, because the crowd seems to have found its own disputes, chairs start to fly. Brick Top's boys are frustrated in the mayhem. Brick Top calmly dials into his mobile telephone. It rings.</context>

They both have sawed-off shotguns and empty four barrels into the chest of Brick Top and Ken. The car spins away, leaving their twitching bodies on the dirt.</context>

There's a pause while all now focus again on the dog. This is digested literally and mentally. The dog recognizes all the attention it's receiving. And goes through the motions of swallowing it. Hands attempts an approach. The dog understandably feels uncomfortable about the advancing vanguard and decides emergency action is needed, and seeing the open window launches itself out of it.</context>
