      <utterance>It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years. Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal. A few million at the very most. The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.</utterance>

      <utterance>Mrs. Otto, there is no such thing as an accident. The word doesn't mean anything to me. As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner. Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement. They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference. That's what's done, Mrs. Otto. I've seen it happen so many times before.</utterance>

      <utterance>How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto? How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?</utterance>
   <speaker>MITCHELL</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>

   <speaker>MITCHELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Pause.</context>
      <utterance>absolutely true. And now, it's up to me to make them build that bus with an extra bolt, or add an extra yard of guard rail. It's the only way we can ensure moral responsibility in this society. By what I do.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Listen to me, Mrs Otto. Listen very carefully. I do know what's best. As we're sitting here the town or the school board or the manufacturer of that bus are lining up a battery of their own lawyers to negotiate with people as grief-stricken as yourselves. And this makes me very, very mad. It's why I came all the way up here. If everyone had done their job with integrity your son would be alive this morning and safely in school. I promise you that I will pursue and reveal who it was that did not do their job.</utterance>

      <utterance>It's unlikely that anyone will go to prison, Mrs. Otto. But he or his company will pay in other ways. And we must make them pay. Not for the money or to compensate you for the loss of your son. That can't be done. But to protect other innocent children. You see, I'm not just here to speak for your anger, but for the future as well.  What we're talking about is an ongoing relationship to time.</utterance>

      <utterance>You saw the speedometer?</utterance>
   <speaker>NICOLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>SCHWARTZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Driscoll?</context>
      <utterance>Did you say anything to Mrs.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICOLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No.</utterance>
   <speaker>SCHWARTZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why not?</utterance>
   <speaker>NICOLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I was scared. And there wasn't time.</utterance>

      <utterance>There wasn't time?</utterance>
   <speaker>NICOLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No. Because the bus went off the road. And crashed.</utterance>
   <speaker>SCHWARTZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You remember this?</utterance>
   <speaker>NICOLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes. I do now. Now that I'm telling it.</utterance>
   <speaker>MITCHELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Note that.</context>
      <utterance>She said, 'Now that I'm telling it'.</utterance>
   <speaker>SCHWARTZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What do you remember about the accident?</utterance>
   <speaker>NICOLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>SCHWARTZ smiles and makes some notes in his pad. He talks to MITCHELL without looking up.</context>
      <utterance>I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything. And that's all. I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all. Then I was in the hospital.</utterance>
   <speaker>SCHWARTZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MITCHELL stares silently at NICOLE for a long time.</context>
      <utterance>Do you have any questions, Mr. Stephens?</utterance>
   <speaker>NICOLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Daddy was leaning forward in his chair, his mouth half open, as if he wanted to say something. Like what, Daddy? Like 'What about my money?' NICOLE and SAM stare at each other.</utterance>
   <speaker>MITCHELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have no questions.</utterance>
   <speaker>SCHWARTZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>NICOLE wheels herself away. She passes MITCHELL.</context>
      <utterance>Thank you, Nicole.</utterance>
   <speaker>MITCHELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>NICOLE wheels herself over to her father.</context>
      <utterance>You'd make a great poker player, kid.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Let's go, Daddy.</utterance>

   <speaker>NICOLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Daddy took a long time. I guess he wanted to have a few words with you. He must have tried to tell you that I was lying. Then you would tell Daddy that it didn't matter if I was lying or not, the lawsuit is dead. As NICOLE'S words are heard, her point of view of SAM and MITCHELL arguing is seen. The movement of their lips is in sync with NICOLE'S voice over.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICOLE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Everyone's lawsuit is dead. Forget it. Tell the others to forget it. It's over. Right now, Sam, the thing you've got to worry about is why she lied. A kid who'd do that to her own father is not normal, Sam. SAM comes down the stairs and enters the car, sitting down at the driver's seat. NICOLE stares at him as he starts the car.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICOLE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>SAM stares ahead, not knowing what to do next.</context>
      <utterance>But Daddy knows who lied. He knows who the liar is. He knows who's normal.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICOLE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>SAM turns to look at NICOLE.</context>
      <utterance>I hope he lets us keep the computer.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICOLE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'd like an ice cream.</utterance>

      <context>NICOLE looks at a team of men constructing a ride. A school bus pulls up, and a group of children spill out. NICOLE watches as the driver tries to form them into a group.</context>
