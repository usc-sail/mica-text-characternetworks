      <utterance>Baby, the girl in that picture was nothing more than a crush. I could never get her and there's no possibility I'll ever be with her. She was a total stranger.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well not the creepy "your mom was in an accident, now come with me" kind. But yeah, the hot lady in the supermarket kind of stranger.</utterance>

      <context>Nick shrugs. He looks at Adam. Suddenly, both their eyes nearly pop out of their skulls.</context>
      <utterance>Think really hard about that one. What happened to me when I was 19?</utterance>

      <utterance>It was easy actually. For a minute, I thought I might be dealing with that whole Timecop thing. You know, the same matter can't occupy the same space at the same time bullshit and we both go poof? Especially after that whole nose thing. But no, it was just a murder.
