I respect that. But you've also been caught. By me. So this is the way how we gonna do things. I don't want to take over, I don't even want to change your scam. Whatever you guys do, it works.

      <context>A long silence.</context>
      <utterance>Store dick dead. Store dick don't want shit.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARCUS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Willie's tone is wooden:</context>
      <utterance>...Fuck the fuckin' store dick.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Again, he licks his lips.</context>

      <context>Marcus flicks his coat front away and pulls a .45 out of his waistband.</context>

      <utterance>Every year you're worse. Every year, less reliable. More booze. More bullshit. More butt-fucking.</utterance>

      <utterance>Sure. The three B'a.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARCUS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He primes the gun. Willie murmurs, more in sadness than in fear:</context>
      <utterance>You gotta be able to rely, Willie.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Marcus points the gun.</context>

      <context>Marcus sneers:</context>
      <utterance>Oh, I don't mean layin' me out. I understand that. But just look at ya. All the shit... grabbin' all this shit -- do you really need all this junk? ...This is Christmas?</utterance>

      <context>A silence.</context>
      <utterance>Oh please. Don't gimme that trite "commercialism" crap. This is what we do, Willie. We get the shit. Christmas time, we get the shit. Because we are men. And Lois. It is Christmas, Willie, and we are men, and Lois.</utterance>

      <context>Marcus sighs.</context>

   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Exploding merchandise chases along the counter behind Willie as the cops seek to put him down. Under the gunfire we hear Marcus's maniacal laughter. Willie reaches the end of the counter. A brief open space separates him from a stairwell; he dashes across as gunfire redoubles and plunges down the stairs.</context>
      <utterance>...fuck me fuck me fuck me... Gunfire fills the air.</utterance>

      <context>Willie is sprinting up the walk toward the front door. His voice echoes lone and weak after the boom of the megaphone:</context>
      <utterance>Halt, put your hands up!</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He bounds up the stoop.</context>

      <context>At the top of the stoop, facing the door, Willie staggers, rolls his eyes, and -- drops.</context>
      <utterance>All right, boys -- nail him! A ripple of gunfire.</utterance>

      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We are FADING IN on a shelf in the Kid's bedroom where the stuffed elephant sits, in a place of honor, its fur indeed stiff and stained with dried blood. The Kid's bedroom is no longer in disarray, things are neat and comfy. We PAN OFF of it to find this letter, crudely handwritten, tacked up on a little bulletin board.</context>
      <utterance>Dear kid. I hope that you got my present and that there wasn't too much blood on it, although there was blood on the present you gave me which didn't keep me from enjoying it, so maybe the blood doesn't matter so much I guess.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Our CONTINUING PAN brings us to the open door of the bedroom and we hear the sound of the TV in the living room. We TRACK toward it.</context>
      <utterance>...Anyway, just in case they took it as evidence I am also sending you a T-shirt. I hope it's the right size. I am healing up good and they tell me that I will soon be one hundred percent even with eight bullets dug out of me because they didn't hit any vital organs, just my liver which is fucked anyway, ha-ha-ha. Anyways...</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Grandma is in the living room watching TV. We TRACK past her towards the Jacuzzi area.</context>
      <utterance>...Thank you for giving that letter to the cops. I forgot I asked you to do it but it's a good thing you did or Santa's little helper would've plugged his ass. And now the cops know I wrote it, which is gonna keep my ass out of jail. That, plus everyone agreeing that the Phoenix police department shooting an unarmed Santa was even more fucked-up than Rodney King. The cops are treating me like fucking royalty now which is new in my experience. They are gonna make me a sensitivity counselor so that tragedies like this will never again embarrass the whole fucking department. Whatever.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sue is in a towel, holding a highball as she climbs out of the Jacuzzi. The Kid walks by her carrying a bucket. She tousles his hair affectionately as he goes by. He's never looked better. WE TRACK TOWARDS THE FOYER. It's empty but the front door is open. We TRACK towards it. We go out the front door...</context>
      <utterance>...As for my little helper, I am sorry to have to tell you that him and his prune-faced mail-order-wife are gonna be exploring mountains with your dad. I hope your dad doesn't go sucking shit from them like I did. Meanwhile, I told the cops you had no one to take the fuck care of you, so they set it up with Mrs. Santa's sister watching you till your Dad gets back in one year and three months. They made her a Guardian Pro-Temp or some such shit... anyway, she makes better money than bartending and seems to like you and your house and Jacuzzi.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>The Kid is dipping a toilet-bowl brush into a bucket of soapy water on the front stoop.</context>
      <utterance>...So I'll be staying in Phoenix now, telling the police how screwed- up they are which is not a bad job as jobs go. They're supposed to let me out of this hospital room soon so I'll see you when I come over to fuck Mrs. Santa's sister in the Jacuzzi. Until then, don't take no shit from nobody. Least of all yourself. Anyways... see ya soon...</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLIE</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>As the Kid turns and hunkers down to scrub the dried blood off the stoop, we see the back of his T-shirt. SHIT HAPPENS</context>
      <utterance>...Santa.</utterance>
