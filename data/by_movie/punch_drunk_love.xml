      <utterance>It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...</utterance>

      <utterance>So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --</utterance>

      <context>He hangs up the phone and walks through his warehouse. It's fairly non-descript place, boxing materials, etc. Products seem to be mainly silly novelties (pens that light up, key chains, novelty toilet plungers, etc) He lifts a LOADING DOOR and LIGHT POURS INSIDE, WASHES OUT THE FRAME....he's silhouette....CAMERA follows him out...stays overexposed and over his shoulder as he looks down towards the street..... ...his business is situated at the end of a common driveway, shared with a few other nondescript places and an Auto mechanic....distant SOUND of a car SPEEDING and SKIDDING.... ....hold, then: ....a JEEP CHEROKEE comes FLIPPING into FRAME, far off at the mouth of the alley, on the street. The JEEP ends up landing RIGHT SIDE UP....HOLD.... .....Barry flinches a little, stares.....the JEEP sits idle for a moment....then it drives off....then: A speeding, small TOYOTA comes into view at the mouth of the alley, screeching to a halt. The passenger side door opens and a small, wooden HARMONIUM (like a portable organ) is placed on the ground. The TOYOTA speeds away..... ....a moment or two later another NON-DESCRIPT CAR flies past very fast.... BEAT. Barry squints, looks at the small HARMONIUM sitting alone in the middle of the street. He hesitates, looks around, holds, then walks back inside his warehouse.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?</utterance>
   <speaker>BARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?</utterance>
   <speaker>LENA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, no. I did.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?</utterance>
   <speaker>LENA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....</utterance>
   <speaker>LENA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah?</utterance>
   <speaker>BARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....</utterance>
   <speaker>LENA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You were talking about the promotion --</utterance>
   <speaker>BARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?</utterance>
   <speaker>LENA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>You see?</context>
      <utterance>That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You see?</utterance>
   <speaker>LENA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, no, I see --</utterance>
   <speaker>BARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>....yeah....</utterance>

      <utterance>My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --</utterance>
