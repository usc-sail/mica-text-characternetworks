      <context>Black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist. The buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar. A cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand. A perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck. An elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails to the knees is fitted to his torso. His hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted. His eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb. His cheeks are pinched. A red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel. Leopold stares into the mirror. The effect is DAZZLING. He raises one eyebrow. Then, in a voice you could pour over a waffle:</context>
      <utterance>Fine linen undervest slides over his head.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He bows. As he rises, the reflection of Leopold's UNCLE OTTO, a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind Leopold in the looking glass.</context>
      <utterance>You dance like a herd of cattle, Miss Fairchild. You are a rare woman who lights up the room... simply by leaving it.</utterance>
   <speaker>UNCLE OTTO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join us downstairs after completing this one-sided flash of wit?</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle Otto. No one really listens to anyone else. If you attempt it, you will see why.</utterance>
   <speaker>UNCLE OTTO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You judge everything too severely. I wonder what would happen if you were to cast that critical eye inward?</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You do not wonder at all. You merely ask in order to state your own opinion.</utterance>
   <speaker>UNCLE OTTO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We are all concerned about you.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ahh, here it comes.</utterance>
   <speaker>UNCLE OTTO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Your life does not seem to have any direction. At the age of 25 a man is too young to do anything well. At 35 he is too old. Now is your time to take action. Tell me, what is it you want to DO with your life?</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I do not know.</utterance>
   <speaker>UNCLE OTTO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Leopold, stung, takes a moment to compose himself.</context>
      <utterance>Your ignorance cramps my conversation.  Wake up! This is your one and only life. Every man has the chance to make a difference. DO something!</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I am most grateful for your surveillance and for your sympathy. I assure you there is no need for concern. I am as effectual and attentive... as my position allows.</utterance>
   <speaker>UNCLE OTTO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He leaves. Leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers. The valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy. Leopold shoots him a look. The valet fills the glass higher. Leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway. He hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause. Finally...</context>
      <utterance>Life is not position, Leopold. It is action.  I will see you downstairs promptly. In the appropriate frame of mind.</utterance>
   <speaker>THE VALET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Without looking back, Leopold leaves the room.</context>
      <utterance>Go spread joy.</utterance>

      <context>Miss Fairchild curtseys heavily. Leopold glances at his card, sees the name Miss Serena Clacket and shudders. He spots a VERY LOVELY WOMAN hidden amongst the guests. She scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around. Hiding his dance card, he saunters over.</context>
      <utterance>You dance like an angel, Miss Fairchild. You light up the room. I thank you.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The young woman stares vacantly at Leopold until she realizes he is addressing her. She puts her pad away.</context>
      <utterance>Good evening. I do not believe I have had the pleasure.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently.</context>
      <utterance>...Julia Carlson.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>

      <utterance>You are not from the area, are you?</utterance>

      <utterance>This is my estate.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Leopold regards her curiously. The orchestra starts up. There is a hubbub amongst the guests.</context>
      <utterance>Really?  Well it's not home but it's much...</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY.</utterance>

      <utterance>The? Oh, that's from Paris, isn't it?</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Leopold spots Uncle Otto observing him from across the room.</context>
      <utterance>It is a scandal nonetheless.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Miss Carlson, do me the honor?</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Truly I would be in your debt. Any admonition would be erased simply by presenting a partner as lovely as yourself.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Leopold stiffly holds out his arm. A beat. Carlson, stuck, takes it WITH HESITATION and is escorted to the dance floor. They dance. ALL but Leopold and Carlson gaily sing "TA-RA-RA- BOOM-DE-AY." Leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten. Carlson, shy at first, eventually smiles brightly.</context>
      <utterance>No, no. Really, I...</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I suppose we really ought to sing along.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They half sing, half speak the TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY, their emphasis on "BOOM." Laughing giddily, their dancing becomes freer, picking up speed. The room SPINS. Finally:</context>
      <utterance>Oh, golly.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you for the dance. It was lovely. I hope it wasn't too awful for you.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There is a slight pause. The Grandfather CLOCK strikes midnight.</context>
      <utterance>Not at all. It was most enlightening.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I really must be going.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>

      <utterance>I won't hear of it.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, I'm quite late as it is.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Carlson spins around quickly, panicked. Leopold STOPS. Partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped, MECHANICAL device. It's door open, lit from within, casting a weird glow.</context>
      <utterance>Miss Carlson?</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Good God...</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch it...</context>
      <utterance>What are you...? You frightened me.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Carlson shakes her head, unsure of how to proceed.</context>
      <utterance>What sort of mechanism is this?</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Answer me!</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLSON</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Listen to me. Please. Move very slowly. Step out of the machine. Step out and I'll explain whatever you want to know.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEOPOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His hand comes to rest on a glowing red lever.</context>
      <utterance>What is this? Who are you?</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She YANKS on his arm. Instinctively he pulls away, accidentally thrusting the lever into action. Carlson falls from the machine.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, God.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The machine LIGHTS UP.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, uh... Quite by accident we came upon a formula utilizing Tachyons... particles traveling faster than the speed of light, which allowed us to... fold time so to speak.</utterance>

      <context>Awkward pause. Leopold looks carefully around the room for the first time: modern mechanical equipment, data shifting and changing, giant cooling devices, bright neon lighting. The doctors are silent.</context>

After a moment, he purposefully steps back inside. He makes a large ARC around the television set, is confronted by one of Charlie's sculptures and makes an ARC around that. He finds himself in front of a light switch and gingerly examines it. As he does, track lighting ILLUMINATES the room. He looks at the lights then back at the switch.

She slowly pulls open a drawer and from deep inside pulls out an old photo album. She opens it and begins to look through.</context>

Across the expansive room, over the tops of heads, Charlie and Kate bob amongst the guests. Leo cuts in. As they spin, in the briefest of seconds, Kate spots Carlson. She pales. They TURN. Kate peers over Leo's shoulder. Her eyes lock with Julia's. Julia nods with purpose. Kate holds onto Leo tightly, not wanting to let go. She buries her head in his chest.</context>

      <context>The music changes: A LIVELY CHARLESTON. Leopold heaves a sigh of relief and makes his way through the crowd, up the staircase. The dancers become an intricate maze, a dead end at every turn as Kate searches each male face. In the foreground, Leopold is stopped by a woman midway up the stairs. As they chat, Leopold reaches down and picks up the muddy slipper, offering it to her. She turns in a huff, flouncing down the stairs. Simultaneously, in the background, Kate desperately looks for Leopold. Leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the stairs. He slows down, hesitates and STOPS. Very slowly he turns around. He becomes very still. TEARS well up in his eyes. The ballroom clock strikes MIDNIGHT. Kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view then STOPS. In her heart SHE KNOWS. Slowly she turns. Leopold stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs, gazing up at her. He extends his arm, showing her THE RING. He offers her his hand. The crowd, the room, THE WORLD AROUND THEM, DISAPPEAR. Their eyes lock. As she descends the staircase, THE YEARS MELT AWAY. Kate's short hair grows long, cascading around her shoulders. The fine lines around Leopold's face are gone. They see themselves through each other's eyes, at the moment of youth, when they fell in love. Leopold bends down, places the slipper on Kate's foot. He rises, looks down at his hands and then up at Kate. His hands are caked with mud. She smiles helplessly. Not caring, he wraps his arms tightly around her. MUSIC begins to play, a slow waltz. He nods to her. She takes a deep breath. Her head bobs in rhythm. She begins to count silently. Leopold smiles, counting along.</context>
