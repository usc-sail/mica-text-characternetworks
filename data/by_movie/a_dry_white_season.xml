      <context>Gordon returns to his work a little distance further. A group of students are laughing and pushing each other boisterously. As they near Jonathan, two nudge each other and giggle. Then, one of them trips Jonathan. He falls to the ground and jumps up aggressively, about to attack the boy. Gordon shouts "Jonathan." The headmaster, MRS. CLOETE, aged 65 years, has observed the incident, but takes no action. Jonathan stands panting with rage. He suddenly strides away towards the gate in a rage.</context>

      <context>The man and several others advance on the boys. The boys run into the serving area, close the doors and start breaking up the place. Two police Land Rovers SCREECH to a halt outside. The boys run out through a side en- trance. They are chased by the police who are black. Jonathan and his best friend Wellington, also 15 years, are walking towards the beer hall when the boys come running out chased by the police. It is prudent for them to run down the street. The boys and police are bearing down on them. Their escape is cut off by the apperance of another police Land Rover. Two policemen, two blacks and two whites join in the capture. Jonathan, Wellington and about ten of the boys are arrested. As they are hundled into the vehicle, they protest their innocence without success and are driven away.</context>

      <context>Disperse immediately or I will take action. A voice in the crowd shouts "Banutu education..." The crowd shouts back "Stinks, Stinks, Stinks." The Commandant gives a hand signal. Tear gas canisters are thrown into the crowd, the dog- handlers attack. There is panic with Students running in all directions, several choking. Some of the students start throwing stones at the police, hitting one in the face; he is helped away by a black policeman. Without warning, SHOOTING STARTS. Children drop, wounded; friends trying to help the dying and seriously wounded, others helped away. Some boys appear with dustbin lids as protection and they pelt the police with stones. The police in the 'hippos' are jumping off and pursuing Students, some SHOOTING. Woman grabs two of the running children age about 9/10 and hustles them into house. Jonathan and Wellington are running with a group. In the distance the sound of an AMBULANCE SIREN. A Jeep cuts off their escape, they turn back running as SHOTS are FIRED towards them, a little girl drops, shot in the back. Jonathan shouts to Wellington who is ahead of him.</context>

Two policemen suddenly appear from behind a house, they are about 18 years old. The girl straightens up and confronts the two policemen shouting hysterically.</context>

Suddenly, the passengers are gripped by the seriousness of the situation. There are snatches of conversation such as: "That's the superintendent's office on fire." "I hope the children are home." "We have to dodge bullets tonight." "Vorster must hang for this." "I hope the world hears about this."</context>
      <utterance>'They will pay, they will pay.' Since when have they been killing us, putting us in jails, starving our children to death, taking our land? Hundreds of years. And what have you men done? Only talk, talk, talk. You are not men. Sis.</utterance>
