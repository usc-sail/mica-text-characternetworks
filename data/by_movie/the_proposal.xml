Well, it was our six month anniversary and I was out for my normal jog in the park, when who do I see in a horse drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting for me halfway through my run? Richard! So I ran up to the carriage and asked him what was going on, and he put his finger to his lips and says, "shhhh." So there I am in my jogging clothes, next to the most handsome mute in the world - have you seen him in a tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and smiling ear to ear. Couple minutes later, we arrive at Tavern on the Green. Best part, we're the only people in the place because Richard got them to open up early. Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just as the sun starts to peek above the trees, this beautiful man gets down on one knee, and says "I didn't want one more sunrise to go by without you knowing that you are the light of my life, and that I would be the luckiest man in the world if you would be my wife. Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry me?" The group is silent, waiting for the clincher. MARGARET  I said yes.</utterance>

Margaret shakes her head, looks back at Balzac when -- WHOOSH! The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and takes off. Margaret jumps. There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle. She stays calm on the phone. MARGARET (cont'd) Could you hold on just a second?

      <context>(To the crowd) We are gathered here today to celebrate one of life's greatest moments. To give recognition to the beauty, honesty, and unselfish ways... Margaret looks at Richard on the word "unselfish," but he's looking straight ahead, determined to get through this. RAMONE (cont'd) ...of Richard and Margaret's true love... "True Love" gets Margaret as well, although no one in the audience notices. RAMONE (cont'd) ...before their family and friends. "Family and Friends" gets a reaction out of Gertrude and Geoffrey. She purses her lips. He holds on to his chair in order to keep himself seated. RAMONE (cont'd) For it is family and friends who taught Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only right that family and friends all celebrate that love here today.</context>

      <context>(looks at Annie) Well, consider this me keeping my promise. Geoffrey pulls out his cell phone and hits a button. He waits for an answer. GEOFFREY (cont'd) (to phone) Hey! Maguire! Yeah, yeah, yeah, her running out was something. But that's what I'm calling about. I've got a favor to ask you, €˜bout one of your planes...</context>

      <context>Margaret goes to answer, but stops. Richard is right. She wants to go back. Even the passengers on the plane can see it. Gilbertson panics.</context>
      <utterance>Because I am sick that you left. And if you feel sick too, then why shouldn't we just be together?</utterance>

I've known your son for years, but we've just recently begun to see each other romantically. (to Geoffrey) I want to get to know you all, and spend some real time up here in Alaska. (to Annie) I'm not sure when you are going to see him get married, but I promise as long as I'm with him, he'll be happy. Passengers cram up to the plane windows to see what will happen.</context>
      <utterance>Absolutely not. But who knows?</utterance>
