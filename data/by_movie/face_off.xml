      <utterance>I'll contact you when we get the rest of the money.  Oh, and stat away from downtown. The inversion layer's going to be pretty thick around the 18th.</utterance>
   <speaker>CASTOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As the JET TURBINES start to WHINE, Castor sinks into his seat. A very sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT appears and hands him a Scotch. He downs it, looking her over salaciously.</context>

      <utterance>It's Archer.  Go, dammit!</utterance>
   <speaker>WINTERS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But Castor elbows the throttle up. The jet lurches forward, throwing Winters off balance. Pollux tackles her as the jet picks up speed.</context>

      <context>Tito obeys as Archer peels out. The HUMMER ROARS at the jet. The jet picks up speed, trying to get aloft. The humvee is aimed right at it... Archer's eyes narrow.</context>

      <utterance>Forget it -- Go! Go!</utterance>
   <speaker>CASTOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Pollux starts FIRING -- covering Castor as he runs through a tunnel which leads to an adjoining hangar. Suddenly Wanda presses her machine-pistol into Pollux's head. As Pollux raises his gun -- Tito grabs his hand.</context>
      <utterance>Wherever they put you, I'll find a way to get you out...</utterance>
   <speaker>TITO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>-- not unless you want that 200 I.Q. splattered all over the floor.  We got him now, Jon.</utterance>
   <speaker>ARCHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Archer moves away from the group and enters the tunnel. MUSIC as Archer and Castor begin their cat-and-mouse dance. Sensing Archer, Castor pauses by an old landing gear. He draws a fresh pistol from his ankle holster and moves on. Archer pauses at the landing gear... his own stealthy movements mirroring Castor's. Castor waits behind a stack of steel drums... his gaze trying to penetrate the darkness... He SNAPS his fingers. The sound ECHOES as he tries to draw Archer in. Archer reacts to the sound and SNAPS back -- answering the challenge. As the deadly beat between them continues -- BLAM BLAM BLAM! Archer spins away just as Castor OPENS FIRE from the gloom... one step ahead. INTERCUT as necessary:</context>
      <utterance>That's what you always say. Seal it off. I'm going in.</utterance>
   <speaker>CASTOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.</utterance>
   <speaker>ARCHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>BOOM BOOM BOOM! Half-blind SHOTS send Castor spinning. A moment later, Archer pursues... SNAP! He fits a new CLIP into his pistol.</context>
      <utterance>And how much will your 'fun' net you this time?</utterance>
   <speaker>CASTOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's it to you? I declare it. Here I am, back in the States for less than a week --</utterance>
   <speaker>ARCHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --</utterance>
   <speaker>CASTOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I've got something going down on the eighteenth... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaoh. I'll give it up -- but my brother and I have to walk.</utterance>
   <speaker>ARCHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No discussion -- no deals.</utterance>
   <speaker>CASTOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Enraged, Archer steps boldly forward -- trying to draw his enemy out. Silence -- then Archer senses... Castor is behind him. He FIRES -- Archer dives away. The BARRAGE CONTINUES -- driving Archer back between two huge turbine engines. As Archer reloads, he stares at the control panel switches. Castor moves in for the kill when he hears a final SNAP- SNAP. Except it isn't a finger snap... it's two switches. VRRRROOOM! The TWIN ENGINES ROAR on! Unable to fight the churning tornado-force wind... Castor's blasted across the hangar... slamming hard into the far wall. The ENGINES STOP and Archer emerges -- joined by Tito.</context>
      <utterance>What're you gonna do with me locked up? You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?</utterance>
   <speaker>TITO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Then Tito follows Archer's gaze to Castor's lifeless body. Still as death -- somehow his mocking smile survives.</context>

      <context>The van takes off -- passing an imposing older man, flanked by two bodyguards. Bullying through the media, Assistant FBI Director VICTOR LAZARRO scans the devastation. Approaching Archer, he watches as Castor's body is loaded on the ambulance. A sheet covers Castor's lifeless face.</context>

      <context>Archer contemplates the slain agents -- their three bodies laid out in a row -- waiting to be zip-locked. Lazarro reacts grimly as a reporter snaps a photo of the bodies. Instinctively, the two men close ranks. Archer grabs the Nikon, ejects the film, then shoves the camera back.</context>
      <utterance>Real fine, Victor. Especially the casualties.</utterance>
   <speaker>LAZARRO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

Dubov drops another over the catwalk. They continue their desperate race for the door -- reaching the landing. As BULLETS PING around them -- hulking Dubov rips away a floor panel. He uses it as a shield as Archer sparks up Walton's lighter. As SLUGS EXPLODE into the shield -- Archer places the flame to his thumb... and peels off the skin mold. He presses his thumb to the door's keypad. To his horror, its LED reads "print unreadable." Walton and guards movie in, FIRING at closer and closer range. Dubov staggers under the FUSILLADE OF BULLETS. The shield is repeatedly punctured -- and is quickly disintegrating. Archer licks his thumb, tries again.
