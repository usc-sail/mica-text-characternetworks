      <mode></mode>
      <context>JACQUES walks over, and sure enough sees something shining a few feet down in the water.</context>
      <utterance>Look! Right there! It's shining!</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A coin.</utterance>
   <speaker>FIRST BOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I found it.</utterance>
   <speaker>SECOND BOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Camera pans and we see a middle-aged PRIEST loading supplies into a small boat. He stops to watch the children's negotiations. Little JACQUES is putting his flippers on.</context>
      <utterance>Liar!</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The two boys nod as they point to the coin.</context>
      <utterance>Ok. I'll get it, but no fighting, all right?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We'll split it.</utterance>
   <speaker>FIRST BOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You can't split a coin. That's stupid.</utterance>
   <speaker>SECOND BOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The pope smiles.</context>
      <utterance>He's right. You're stupid.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then we'll buy something and split that.</utterance>
   <speaker>SECOND BOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A helicopter...</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's a small coin.</utterance>
   <speaker>FIRST BOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A Ferrari.</utterance>
   <speaker>SECOND BOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't want a Ferrari... What is it?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The two boys look at each other.</context>
      <utterance>Maybe a little radio.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well. We'll decide later. The light is going.</utterance>
   <speaker>SECOND BOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I get the radio from after school, until midnight.</utterance>
   <speaker>FIRST BOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Since when do you stay up until midnight?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All right, all right... Can I concentrate? And you can stop pointing. I've seen it.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>The voice is ENZO'S. Another young boy wearing little round glasses.</context>
      <utterance>I've seen it too.</utterance>
   <speaker>FIRST BOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He is slightly older than JACQUES but he is taller. ENZO is with ROBERTO, his younger brother, the only one allowed to carry his flippers. Five kids are behind him.</context>
      <utterance>Shit, it's the Italian!</utterance>
   <speaker>ENZO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman! How is the little Frenchman?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ENZO pats JACQUES on the shoulder and leaves his hand there -- a lightly intimidating gesture.</context>
      <utterance>Fine!</utterance>
   <speaker>ENZO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You don't mind if I go instead, do you?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No...</utterance>
   <speaker>ENZO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ENZO pats his shoulder reassuringly.</context>
      <utterance>If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?</utterance>
   <speaker>ENZO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ROBERTO who has already started to moisten his big brother's gear in the water, holds a pair of dripping flippers and a glistening mask. The pope watches the scene with obvious pleasure.</context>
      <utterance>Roberto, mio palmo!</utterance>
   <speaker>ENZO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sure of himself, ENZO takes a deep breath and dives in the water. ROBERTO counts out loud.</context>
      <utterance>Count!</utterance>
</dialogue>

<dialogue id="2" n_utterances="11">
   <speaker>ENZO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ENZO smiles and slowly puts the coin in his pocket. He pulls it out again and waves it under JACQUES' nose.</context>
      <utterance>Who's is it now? You saw it but I dove for it! JACQUES doesn't answer.</utterance>
   <speaker>ENZO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Roberto? How long?</utterance>
   <speaker>ROBERTO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ENZO looks at JACQUES for a while.</context>
      <utterance>Six seconds.</utterance>
   <speaker>ENZO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JACQUES doesn't say anything, then finally shakes his head, negatively. ENZO smiles, taps him on the shoulder.</context>
      <utterance>I'll throw it back into the water. You dive and if you do less than six, it's yours.</utterance>
   <speaker>ENZO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The first boy finally sums up his courage to speak.</context>
      <utterance>Brava!</utterance>
   <speaker>BOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Enzo? I saw the coin first... We split?</utterance>
   <speaker>PRIEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JACQUES goes over to him, sees where he is pointing, the faint gleam of the coin underwater.</context>
      <utterance>Jacques... Come, look.</utterance>
   <speaker>PRIEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is it a coin shining down there?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It is. It's a coin! I'll get it for you, Father!</utterance>
   <speaker>PRIEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JACQUES, intent on the coin's glimmer, quickly slips on his fins, prepares his mask. He swims in the water like a fish, goes directly to the coin. Scoops it up, brings it to the surface. He breaks water, waves the coin, looks for the priest and sees he is no longer there.</context>
      <utterance>It'll be for the poor.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He looks at the ancient impression on the coin -- "Boy on a Dolphin".</context>
      <utterance>Padre?</utterance>

<dialogue id="3" n_utterances="2">
   <speaker>FATHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JACQUES rubs his eyes. His father walks over to a pile of blankets on the floor, on the other side of the room. He gives the pile a kick.</context>
      <utterance>... Come on, time to get up, Jacques!</utterance>
   <speaker>FATHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He uncovers a kettle on the fire and ladles up a big bowl of soup for Jacques. A fifty year old man pokes his head out from under the pile of blankets. It's UNCLE LOUIS, who is having a very hard time, waking up.</context>
      <utterance>Louis, wake up!</utterance>
</dialogue>

<dialogue id="4" n_utterances="7">
   <speaker>FATHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JACQUES helps his father into the diver's suit. The burly man struggles into a pair of weighted lead shoes. He seems sluggish and tired. JACQUES watches worriedly. He has a weird feeling.</context>
      <utterance>Jacques, come help me.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.</utterance>
   <speaker>UNCLE LOUIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His father catches him fondly by the scruff of the neck.</context>
      <utterance>Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.</utterance>
   <speaker>UNCLE LOUIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey! Have you ever seen a mermaid?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They keep on pumping for a while, then...</context>
      <utterance>No.</utterance>
   <speaker>UNCLE LOUIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>UNCLE LOUIS goes on. JACQUES doesn't budge.</context>
      <utterance>I've seen them.</utterance>
   <speaker>UNCLE LOUIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JACQUES looks at the bottom to watch his father. He doesn't answer.</context>
      <utterance>Don't you want to know where?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What?</utterance>
   <speaker>UNCLE LOUIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JACQUES calmly looks over at him, slows down his pumping and almost serenely asks him:</context>
      <utterance>Where I saw the mermaids?! Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question! We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>UNCLE LOUIS seems disturbed by the question. A beat.</context>
      <utterance>Why did my mother leave?</utterance>
   <speaker>UNCLE LOUIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Come on now, pump!</utterance>

<dialogue id="6" n_utterances="4">
   <speaker>UNCLE LOUIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They haven't been paying attention to the bubbles gushing at the surface. The air hose is being pulled down in a very worrisome way.</context>
      <utterance>Your mother didn't leave. She went back to America, that's all. It's her home. She's allergic to this Island. She likes refrigerators and machines that clean the floor... so one day she left. Woman are like that, unpredictable, like the sea.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>UNCLE LOUIS smiles.</context>
      <utterance>So where did you see mermaids?</utterance>
   <speaker>UNCLE LOUIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Very pleased with himself, UNCLE LOUIS burst out laughing. JACQUES shyly shrugs his shoulders. The air hose is suddenly yanked down. JACQUES immediately sees all the bubbles. He is white as a sheet. JACQUES rushes to the side of the boat and starts yelling down at his father. He grabs the life line and starts pulling at it hysterically. The air hose snaps and starts flying around like some crazy snake. JACQUES tries to jump overboard. UNCLE LOUIS catches hold of his foot at the last second. JACQUES is slapping the water with his hands, trying to go down but UNCLE LOUIS won't let him. JACQUES is yelling desperately. ENZO is now standing on his rock, watching the scene, horrified. The sea now looks as if it were boiling. UNCLE LOUIS grabs hold of JACQUES and hugs him in his arms. Standing on his rock, ENZO is now crying desperately.</context>
      <utterance>In the bars in Athens!</utterance>
   <speaker>ENZO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The last air bubbles are now breaking on the surface; it looks as if they will never stop.</context>

      <context>JOHANA wants to say something.</context>
      <utterance>... Sure.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ENZO who is sitting at the piano behind them, starts to play, staring at the sea. JACQUES and JOHANA turn around and look at him.</context>
      <utterance>Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one. JOHANA has never looked so sad and lost. JACQUES doesn't notice.</utterance>
   <speaker>ENZO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>... You should start playing the piano, the piano is really refreshing, it clears the sinuses. Very good the piano! Tomorrow is going to be a big day!</utterance>

      <context>ENZO opens one eye.</context>
      <utterance>Enzo?  Enzo... I know you're angry at me.  Enzo, it's important.</utterance>
   <speaker>ENZO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm concentrating.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ENZO looks at him coldly. Takes another deep breath.</context>
      <utterance>We can't dive anymore. They want to cancel the competition for a while.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's not safe, they say. The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live. Free diving is over as a sport.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You say that because you have the title!</utterance>

      <utterance>No! I would never cheat you.</utterance>
   <speaker>ENZO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He takes a last breath, signs himself and reaching for the gueuse, disappears into the water. LAWRENCE, NOVELLI, the MEDICS, and others are arguing. LAWRENCE is furious that ENZO is diving. NOVELLI is balling out his assistants. JACQUES is on the platform watching the others as if they were a gaggle of geese. He listens to the sound of the gueuse playing out, watches the depth indicator, the stopwatches. He knows something is wrong. He walks over to the edge and grabs hold of a little oxygen bottle which is there for security. He takes a few breaths of the oxygen as he puts on his flippers and dives down after ENZO.</context>
      <utterance>Well that's very nice of you.</utterance>

   <speaker>ENZO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He tries to take a deep breath, the effort is exhausting. JACQUES smiles, holding back his tears.</context>

      <utterance>I can't.</utterance>
   <speaker>ENZO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His smile freezes, he stops breathing. His eyes close. JACQUES puts his head down on his friend's chest and sobs. The doctors gently try to move him away, but JACQUES resists.</context>
      <utterance>Jacques, take me back down... Please.</utterance>
   <speaker>LAWRENCE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>LAWRENCE encourages everybody to leave the platform. JACQUES quickly grabs the nearest rope and ties it to his belt. Before anybody can stop him, JACQUES rolls ENZO'S body back into the water and dives after it.</context>
      <utterance>Just give him five minutes! What does it matter now, anyway... Come on, just leave him alone!</utterance>

      <utterance>You've got to tell me what happened?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JACQUES parks the boat in front of the COMMITTEE BOAT'S DIVING PLATFORM. He turns on the platform lights: above and underwater. He throws down the diving cable: 60, 90, 120 feet... JACQUES gets undressed and sits down in the lotus position, concentrating... JOHANA sits down a few feet away and watches him, wondering just how far he is going to push this whole thing. As the cable unrolls, JOHANA starts crying. She understands that JACQUES is going to dive to the bottom, into the blue, into himself.</context>
      <utterance>I saw how it has to be.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JACQUES is putting on his flippers, and stands facing his gueuse.</context>
      <utterance>Jacques, you know I love you.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JOHANA starts pacing up and down the diving platform.</context>
      <utterance>Don't be sad... It's not because of you, it's me. It's all going on inside me!  I've gotta go and see.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JACQUES has not moved, he still sits motionless, facing his gueuse. JOHANA doesn't know what to do or say. She is totally drained.</context>
      <utterance>See what? There is nothing to see! It's pitch black down there! It's cold. You'll be all alone! Look at me, Jacques! I am here! I exist! Look!!!  I'm real! I am not a dream! Jacques will you look at me?  Please!</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Jacques? I'm pregnant.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACQUES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>It's wonderful for you.</context>
      <utterance>That's good... that's wonderful.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Silence. JACQUES is petrified, without any reaction. He doesn't understand. She realizes it's hopeless and stares at the sea.</context>
      <utterance>You are the father.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She kisses him.</context>
      <utterance>I lied... to keep you here.</utterance>

      <utterance>Anything.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHANA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She pulls the line releasing the gueuse. JACQUES takes a deep breath and grabbing hold of the gueuse, disappears into the water -- as if swallowed by the ocean.</context>
      <utterance>Promise you won't forget me.</utterance>
