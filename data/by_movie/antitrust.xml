      <utterance>Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>He looks over. Milo looks over. Among the framed commendations, awards, degrees we see Milo's childhood program, written on Outpost 1.0. Gary has had it framed. Milo absorbs it. Even now, he feels something for Gary.</context>
      <utterance>You see what's hanging on the wall?</utterance>
   <speaker>GARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.</utterance>
   <speaker>MILO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Milo smiles almost tenderly. He doesn't know if Gary buys it. Perhaps if he could see Gary's eyes. But they're obscured by Bosch's writhing bodies, reflected on his eyeglasses. Gary moves away from Milo, he stands over the table with the art books, vaguely looks through one.</context>
      <utterance>I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.</utterance>
   <speaker>GARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Milo wonders: does he know? He picks his words carefully.</context>
      <utterance>When will you have a Beta version?</utterance>
   <speaker>MILO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.</utterance>
   <speaker>GARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Gary puts down the book. Something in his tone draws Milo.</context>
      <utterance>I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.</utterance>
   <speaker>GARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Is this a confession? A plea for understanding? Or just a pep-talk to keep Milo focused on Skywire?</context>
      <utterance>So you have to remind yourself: it's just the process. Something's always lost along the way to anything worthwhile. Some little bug, some glitch. 'Can't get bogged down in that, you're doing something other people could never do. They lack the imagination, the brain, the nerve. Let them fret about every unforeseen consequence. You have to solve the problem. That's who you are.</utterance>

      <context>2. TIMES SQUARE - Pedestrians and motorists (with craned necks) watch the Jumbo-Tron, now the world's biggest desktop. In one window, college video of a promising Programmer, in the other, footage of a cult suicide. (Sometimes the Programmer in question is simultaneous with his obit, sometimes not, but the connection by now becomes clear).</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>business is: those who don't innovate are doomed to die. 3. The cuts accelerate. In a NETWORK CONTROL ROOM, Technicians flip switches, trying to bring back scheduled programming. At the NIKKEI, the Brokers are transfixed by what comes over the Big Board. In a VEGAS CASINO Gamblers sip their drinks as they watch it on closed-circuit horserace monitors. On a STREET CORNER, a Crack Dealer watches on his beeper. At a STADIUM, the Stones play but (tilting up) the Diamond Vision behind them plays Milo's broadcast. In an ELECTRONICS STORE, a wall of TV's -- 200 of them -- plays grisly primer footage for Shoppers. A guy takes a shiny wrapped copy of Outpost '98 from his basket, returns it to the shelf... In the Day Care Computer Room, it plays on all the monitors as Randy moves through the room with a big buzzing electro-magnetic hoop, which he runs over each tower, wiping out data. Through all the cuts, we hear Gary's narration:</context>

   <speaker>GARY'S VOICE OVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's why we work so hard to invent or acquire great new applications. Consumers don't care where new ideas come from, just so long as they're offered at competitive prices. Isn't that what the free market's about? Sure, we like being 1, but it's pressure, too. This business is binary: you're a zero or a one.</utterance>
