      <context>Sara's stomach drops to her feet. Her mother's not there and her free form sucks and she doesn't have a theme. Shit!</context>

   <speaker>SARA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Judges exchange a look. New MUSIC CUES UP. Some driving, CLASSICAL NUMBER. Sara tries to elevate her body above the music, but she's nervous, unsure on her feet. She keeps glancing in the back of the auditorium for Glynn. Searching for her port in the storm. Wondering where her mother is and knowing how badly she's dancing. Knowing but somehow continuing, stumbling, recovering, and finally finishing with those damned knocking knees. The Judges, eyes like stones, perfunctorily nod. Their equivalent of maybe next year. Sara chokes two words out...</context>
      <utterance>Well, it's um, pretty self- explanatory. The theme.</utterance>

   <speaker>ROY</speaker>

      <utterance>Look. Sara. I feel bad too. I mean, we both got hit by the same bolt of lightning. You don't have to pretend this is easy.  Everything's upside down right now but don't worry. We'll work this bachelor-father thing out. Hell, it ain't like we're movin' in with strangers. We got a pretty good idea about each other, right?</utterance>

      <context>Before she can respond, Patrick's voice booms from the back of the auditorium.</context>

   <speaker>PATRICK</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>ANGLE WIDENS to reveal him coming forward. Rushing for the stage. He pauses at the apron of it. Looks up at Sara. She peers down at him, astounded. Shaken. He smiles at her. She smiles back. Patrick's eyes softly take her in.</context>
      <utterance>Yes, sir. She's ready.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You can do it.  Ain't nobody watchin' you but me. Sara's eyes focus on him. She nods. Turns to the judges.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>As her MUSIC cues up, Patrick slowly backs away from the stage. Sara begins to dance. She starts out strong and gets stronger. Every emotion she feels, every experience she's had, comes to life in a way that we've never seen before, not even when she was practicing with Patrick. Her body has finally found a way to get inside this kind of music, to elevate its meaning and transform her dance. The MUSIC ENDS. The lights go up. Sara stands in the middle of the stage breathless, sweating. She lifts her head slowly and the ANGLE WIDENS to reveal --</context>

      <context>Sara pulls Patrick back. Walks alone to the edge of the stage, composed and professional again. She regards the judges with a beaming resolve and a ballerina's curtsy, then simply says:</context>
      <utterance>All due respect, if ya'll don't let this girl in, you're crazy!</utterance>
