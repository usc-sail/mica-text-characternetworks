      <context>He shrugs, disgruntled. The clerk taps her screen. Turning to a row of chutes behind her, she collects a foil covered bowl and a drink can. Lincoln, less than appetized, loads his tray with the oatmeal and juice breakfast. Then he heads into the seating area. In the seating area, male and female residents sit eating and chatting happily. Uniformed busboys intermix, clearing and wiping tables. A divide in this community now starts to become clear... The busboys, like the nutrition clerk, like all the service, maintenance, and administrative staff we'll see, have distinct uniforms but no facial marking. They are known as "outsiders". The "residents", like Lincoln, have crosshatched scars on their upper left brows and ethercuffs o n their wrists. Mostly Caucasian, from mid-twenties to mid-sixties. There are no children here. We isolate a blonde - mid-20's, fresh, bright eyes, a fragile beauty, a crosshatch of two verticals and one horizontal. Her name is ESTER TWO-ALPHA. Seeing Lincoln, she smiles and waves-</context>

      <context>Lincoln just nods across the plaza. Ambient conversation is now ebbing at an arrival. An outsider in a grey, vaguely clerical uniform - sanguine, settled, precise eyes. He might be a prison warden but for the generally warm reception. He is known as The Community Director. His name is MERRICK. He crosses to a lectern, unlooping a chain from his neck with a three-forked pendant known as a "tri-key". He slots the tri-key into the lectern. The glass wall frosts over and pixellates i n t o a live feed of himself. Now amplified by the plaza speakers, Merrick begins his address-</context>
      <utterance>What is it?</utterance>
   <speaker>MERRICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Applause and whistles erupt, mostly from the younger residents, who take on the zeal of a game show audience. The older ones - including Lincoln - greet the prospect with labored tolerance. Merrick turns the tri-key i n the lectern. The glass wall switches from the live feed to a jumbotron o f flashing text;</context>
      <utterance>Good morning. To everyone here and everyone watching on etherscreen, welcome to the community address. Today I'm coming to you from Sector Four. For those of you here with sugar quotas, let me recommend the french toast. I just tried some and it's excellent, really. But I know what everyone's hungry for s o let's move on to the lottery. As always the draw will be made from our host sector. So tell me, Sector Four - is everyone ready for The Daily Spin?</utterance>

   <speaker>RESIDENT #2</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Resident 1 shrugs and hands him a drink can. Resident 2 ducks under the fence, reaching the can down to the track. Or what looks like a track. The struts lining the bed are not sleepers but buffers of galvanized rubber. Nor are there any rails. The relay system is provided by a series of metal posts, flanking the buffers to run in twin parallel. Known as "lode-poles," they now start thrumming and pulsing with red light, like runway beacons.</context>
      <utterance>Okay . But I get to set the can.</utterance>
   <speaker>RESIDENT #1</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Resident 2 regains the platform. We PUSH IN on the drink can, balanced on a buffer. It starts rattling. Then suddenly shoots upward into the air, arcing and bouncing off the tunnel wall, clattering into obscurity. Resident 1 whoops in victory. A rush of air heralds the shuttle. It sails out of the tunnel, floating three feet above the track. A hybrid of subway car and nautical craft, it has runners in place of wheels, like hulls on a catamaran. It is buoyed by a magnetic flow emanating from the lode-poles, an invisible river known as a "lode-stream". The shuttle drifts to a gentle halt, hovering, rocking a little. Its gangplanks fold out toward the platform and the safety fence lowers. Lincoln and the other commuters file routinely aboard.</context>
      <utterance>Hurry it up. The shuttle's coming.</utterance>

   <speaker>DR. SANGER</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's entirely his decision. Our role is intermediary. We, as the insurance provider, guarantee the condition and availability of the agnate but all other rights are retained. In legal terms, the policy holder is defined as a "sponsor". The premiums, in effect, becoming sponsorship payments, maintaining the agnate until such time as harvest is required. At such time and where feasible, the sponsor has the option to extend sponsorship, retaining the agnate for secondary harvest or, shall we say, let the policy expire.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>N o . Not as you and I know it, at least. The associations of life and death are no more applicable to an agnate than to a cow in a field. It exists in a state of limited consciousness - aware not of life but of functionality. Imbued with the knowledge to maintain its function but without the capacity to question it. And yet, in many ways, the end if the most humane part of the process. The agnate goes to harvest without any fore- b o d i n g and is painlessly returned to the sleep from whence it came. Eternal or otherwise. There is mortality for an agnate. Just utility and redundancy.</utterance>

No, what the maternity plan provides is a way round the risks and rigors of childbirth. Under this plan, an agnate becomes eligible for pregnancy shortly after foundation. A simple donation of sperm from the father, then the agnate is fertilized and brings your baby to term.</utterance>

   <speaker>MERRICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's not an exact science - biogenesis. There's a degree of trial and error. If the agnate doesn't come together on the first pass, we have to abort and start over. It's like breaking inertia. The bioreactor, the growth medium - we just keep upping the levels till we achieve integration. At which stage the agnate is deemed physically stable. We rely on foundation to provide mental stability - matching the templates to their capacity but walling it in with parameters.  When signs of instability started to show up, it pointed to foundation. A hole in the wall, an oversight. But it was only happening in the later generat- ions . Which pointed back to biogenesis.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Actually the opposite. We found out in the later generations, the levels were so high that when we broke inertia, the process kept going. Over-integrating. Specifically the neural system. It produced a condition called synesthesia.</utterance>

      <context>Lincoln turns, touching his face. He feels stubble there. For the first time. His body is naturalizing but it feels unnatural to him. Ester reaches out and runs her fingers across his cheek. Lincoln stiffens a little, unused to this type of contact. But her touch is gentle and the contact is warming. Their eyes slowly meet, flickering, something passing between them. Then Ester's face contorts slightly. She emits a shallow cough.</context>
