      <context>There's a whole row of them.</context>
      <utterance>I got it off the wall there.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>But not for you, Paulie, that's the thing. Those are for the staff.</utterance>

      <utterance>I just borrowed it. Don't see what harm it does.</utterance>

      <context>Brad's eyes keep shifting--he obviously doesn't mind abusing the elderly as long as he doesn't get caught doing it.</context>
      <utterance>It's not about harm, it's about rules. You probably don't think an old fart like you has to mind rules anymore, but that's just not true.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Brad lashes out and grabs Paul's other hand, which he's been holding tightly clenched shut.</context>
      <utterance>Nothing. I just walk, that's all, I like to walk!</utterance>

      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>They turn. Elaine stands just inside the screen door with a cup of tea. Brad's eyes become calculated, wondering how much she's seen. Elaine keeps her tone level, betraying nothing:</context>

      <utterance>It's not everybody he has it in for, Paul. It's you.  What did you do to provoke him in the first place? Nothing. He's just an abusive bully, and should be made to stop.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ellie, please... Pete is at the TV, switching channels while:</utterance>
   <speaker>ELDERLY LADIES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He finds the Movie Classic channel, which is playing an old black and white musical--"Top Hat," with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. A delighted reaction:</context>
      <utterance>...no, the Movie Classic channel is further down...past the Home Shopping...keep going...</utterance>
   <speaker>ELDERLY LADY #2</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>idly shifts his gaze to the TV...and his expression goes slack with recognition and dismay. Elaine sees the look in his eyes. He glances away...even briefly considers walking out...but in the end, he can't help himself. The past just caught up with him with a freight-train wallop, and, for one, he decides to ride the rails... He looks back at the TV. On screen, Fred and Ginger have begun their famous "Cheek to Cheek" number, with Astaire singing in that sublime, easy-go-lucky way of his:</context>
      <utterance>Oh! This is wonderful... Paul</utterance>
   <speaker>FRED ASTAIRE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>SLOW PUSH IN on Paul, watching. He'd like to take his eyes off the screen, but the movie has him in a grip tighter than Brad Dolan's. Elaine is watching him with puzzled concern:</context>
      <utterance>Heaven, I'm in heaven...and my heart beat so that I can hardly speak...</utterance>
   <speaker>ELAINE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>No response. All he can hear is that music, all he can see are those dancers. The figures on TV are gliding with ghostlike grace in their silvery, phosphor-dot world of long ago... Paul abruptly bursts into tears. The room goes quiet, everything comes to a standstill. All eyes turn, some concerned, others merely curious. Paul just sits sobbing into his hands, shoulders heaving.</context>
      <utterance>Paul? What is it?</utterance>
   <speaker>ELAINE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>What is it? What's wrong?</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Another orderly appears--Brad Dolan. He puts his hand on Paul's shoulder and leans close, feigning concern.</context>
      <utterance>It's okay...I'll be okay...</utterance>
   <speaker>BRAD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Elaine shoves his hand away, eyes flashing with anger.</context>
      <utterance>S'matter, Paulie? Why the boo-hoo- hoo? Something nasty happen?</utterance>
   <speaker>ELAINE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Brad back off with a "hey, suit yourself" gesture. Elaine helps Paul to his feet and leads him out.</context>

      <utterance>You've mentioned it.</utterance>

      <context>This does come as a surprise. She shakes her head.</context>

   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They usually call death row the Last Mile, but we called ours the Green Mile, because the floor was the color of faded limes. We had the electric chair then. Old Sparky, we called it.  I've lived a lot of years, Ellie, but 1935 takes the prize. That was the year I had the worst urinary infection of my life. That was also the year of John Coffey, and the two dead girls...</utterance>

      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>The door opens, revealing Paul's pale and sweaty face.</context>
      <utterance>For a man pissing razor blades.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You should'a took the day off, gone to see the doctor.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They hear the truck HONKING as it rumbles up outside. Paul gives them a nod to resume their positions. Paul walks down the Mile, passing the cells where two inmates reside--the first is ARLEN BITTERBUCK, a Washita Cherokee; the second is EDUARD DELACROIX("DEL"), a skinny Cajun.</context>
      <utterance>With a new arrival? You know better. Besides, it's not as bad as it was. I think it's clearing up.</utterance>
   <speaker>DEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>New boy coming in, boss?</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Paul arrives at the end of the Mile, takes up a position at an empty cell. (Down at this end, past the cells, is E Block's version of the "hole" -- a padded room where violent inmates are sent to cool off. It isn't used very often...in fact, at the moment, it's doubling as storage space.) Brutal peers out the viewing slot as the truck stops outside.</context>
      <utterance>Never you mind, Del, you just keep your nose quietly on your business.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRUTAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>GUARDS PERCY WETMORE AND HARRY TERWILLIGER OF E BLOCK emerge from the back of the truck and step down, turn back... Tighter angle on back of truck We get our first glimpse of the new inmate as a pair of GIGANTIC BLACK FEET step down into the yard...and the rear of the truck bounces back up on its springs where it belongs. Brutal sees what's coming, eyes widening slightly.</context>
      <utterance>Damn, they're riding on the axle. What'd they do, bust the springs?</utterance>
   <speaker>BRUTAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Paul? You might wanna reconsider getting in the cell with this guy?</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why's that?</utterance>
   <speaker>BRUTAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's enormous.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Brutal tosses him a look--just wait. He swings the door open in a hot flood of daylight, giving us our first good look at: John coffey is a huge black man, nearly 7 feet tall and 300 pounds, his massive head shiny and bald, his skin a tapestry of old scars, his prison overalls (the biggest size they had) ending at mid-calf. He looks dull and confused, as if wondering where he is and how he got there. Percy and Harry lead him toward E Block in shackles. Percy's got his hickory baton out of it custom-made holster, hollering:</context>
      <utterance>Can't be bigger than you.</utterance>
   <speaker>PERCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Paul can't see them approach from where he stands, but he can certainly hear Percy:</context>
      <utterance>Dead man walking! Dead man walking here! Inside the cellblock</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Up by the door, Brutal just rolls his eyes. Percy is the first one through the door, still hollering...</context>
      <utterance>Jeezus, pleeze-us, what the hell's he yelling about?</utterance>
   <speaker>PERCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>...then Coffey enters, ducking low to get through, his shadow blotting out Brutal and Dean as his massive frame fills the door. Everything hangs suspended for a moment, a look of "hold shit" written on everybody's faces. Percy keeps yanking on the big man's cuffs, leading him along with a cry of:</context>
      <utterance>Dead man walking!</utterance>
   <speaker>PERCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Dead man walking! Dead man--</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Percy falls reproachfully silent. Paul doesn't dignify it, just motions for them to come on. The procession comes down the Mile, with Brutal and Dean bringing up rear.</context>
      <utterance>Percy, that's enough.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRUTAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You sure you wanna be in there with him?</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Percy. They're moving house over in the infirmary. Why don't you go see if they could use some help?</utterance>
   <speaker>PERCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They got all the men they need.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Percy flushes red, the baton hovering near his palm. He looks like he's about to say something, but thinks better of it and stalks angrily up the Mile instead... ...and sees Del at his bars, smiling. Infuriated, Percy swings his baton and smashes Del's fingers with a LOUD CRACK. Del jerks back, howling in pain:</context>
      <utterance>Why don't you just go make sure?  I don't care where you go, Percy, as long as it's not here at this very moment.</utterance>

      <context>Coffey doesn't miss a beat, as if he's been waiting to ask:</context>
      <utterance>Your time here can be easy or hard, depends on you. If you behave, you get to walk in the exercise yard every day. We might even play some music on the radio from time to time. Questions?</utterance>
   <speaker>COFFEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Paul blinks. It's the last thing he expected. Coffey smiles uneasily, as if they might think him foolish for asking.</context>
      <utterance>Do you leave a light on after bedtime?</utterance>
   <speaker>COFFEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Paul looks to his men. The guards are trading glances.</context>

      <context>Coffey nods, relieved. Then he surprises everybody by offering Paul his hand, as if to show proper manners. Paul hesitates, oddly touched, then surprised his men even more by accepting. Coffey's hand swallows his. Coffey shakes gently, lets go. Paul steps from the cell. Brutal slides the door shut, locks it. Coffey stands a moment as if unsure what to do, then sinks onto the cot with his hands clasped between his knees. He looks up at Paul, his voice soft as a whisper:</context>

Del catches sight of him and scoops up his mouse, drawing fearfully back on his bunk.

      <context>His hand shoots out, grabs Paul by the collar, jerks him close. Paul makes a panic-grab for his revolver... ...but Coffey lays his free hand atop Paul's, eases his grip from the gun--no need for that. Coffey's hand then drifts slowly down, easing to Paul's crotch...</context>
      <utterance>Just to help.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>...and something goes WHUMP through Paul's body. He arches back with his mouth agape and arms outstretched as a rush of energy seems to pass from Paul through Coffey's hand... ...and then it's over.

They swirl furiously in front of his face, turn white...and disappear. Paul just stares, stunned. Softly:</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No. But a man who does a thing like that has often developed a taste for it over time. Occurred to me it might be easy enough to follow his backtrail and find out. A man his size, and colored to boot, can't be that hard to trace.</utterance>
   <speaker>BURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You'd think so, but you'd be wrong. Believe me, we tried. It's like he dropped out of the sky.</utterance>

      <utterance>How do you explain that?</utterance>
   <speaker>BURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We're in a Depression. A third of the country's out of work. People are drifting by the thousands, looking for work, looking for that greener grass. Even a giant like Coffey wouldn't get noticed everywhere he goes... not until he kills a couple of little girls.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Burt smiles, realizing:</context>
      <utterance>He's...strange, I admit. But there doesn't seem to be any real violence in him. I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith. I deal with 'em day in and day out.</utterance>
   <speaker>BURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You didn't come up here to ask me whether he might have killed before. You came up here to see if I think he did it at all. That's it, isn't it?</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do you?</utterance>
   <speaker>BURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>One seldom sees a less ambiguous case. He was found with the victims in his arms. Blurted out a confession right then and there.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yet you defended him.</utterance>
   <speaker>BURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Cynthia hollers from an open window:</context>

      <utterance>Kids! Lunch!</utterance>

      <context>The kids start this way. Burt turns back to Paul.</context>
      <utterance>Y'all listen to your Momma, now!</utterance>
   <speaker>BURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tell you something. You listen close, too, because it might be something you need to know.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm listening.</utterance>
   <speaker>BURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The little boy comes to him, staring at his feet. Burt tires to raise the boy's chin. The boy resists for a moment...</context>
      <utterance>We had us a dog. No particular breed, but gentle. Ready to lick your hand or fetch a stick. Just a sweet mongrel, you know the kind.  In many way, a good mongrel dog is like you negro. You get to know it, and often you get to love it. It is of no particular use, but you keep it around because you think it loves you. If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you never have to find out any different. My wife and I were not so lucky. Caleb. Come here for a second.</utterance>
   <speaker>BURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>...and then his face comes around. He's horribly scarred on that side, the eye missing.</context>
      <utterance>Please, son.</utterance>
   <speaker>BURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The boy races inside after his sister. Paul follows Burt's gaze off toward the rear of the property, where an unoccupied doghouse stands weathered and sad in the weeds.</context>
      <utterance>He has the one eye. I suppose he's lucky not to be blind. We get down on our knees and thank God for that much at least. Right Caleb?  Okay, go on in now.</utterance>
   <speaker>BURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That dog attacked my boy for no reason. Just got it into his mind one day. Same with John Coffey. He was sorry afterwards, of that I have no doubt...but those little girls stayed raped and murdered nonetheless. Maybe he's never done it before--my dog never bit before, but I didn't concern myself with that. I went out there with my rifle and grabbed his collar and blew his brains out.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Burt acknowledges the condolence with a gracious nod.</context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry for your trouble.</utterance>
   <speaker>BURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He raises his hand, making biting motions with his fingers.</context>
      <utterance>I'm as enlightened as the next man, Mr. Edgecomb. I would not bring back slavery for all the tea in China. I believe we have to be humane and generous in our efforts to solve the race problem. But we have to remember that the negro will bite if he gets the chance, just like a mongrel dog will bite if it crosses its mind to do so.  Is Coffey guilty? Yes, he is. Don't you doubt it, and don't you turn your back on him. You might get away with it once or even a hundred times...but in the end...</utterance>
   <speaker>BURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Paul says nothing. Burt gazes out again. Softly:</context>
      <utterance>You understand?</utterance>
   <speaker>BURT</speaker>

The HUMMING loses its steadiness and starts to waver with a CRACKLING SOUND. Tendrils of smoke begin curling from under the cap, a mixture of burning hair and sponge.

It's a pornographic cartoon book of the type popular in the '30's, featuring crude drawings of famous cartoon characters or movie stars engaged in outlandish sexual acts.

Coffey's reaction is beyond simple surprise; he's actually trembling at Billy's touch as if some electrical circuit were engaged.

      <context>Nothing for the longest moment. Percy just staring... ...and then he pulls his gun and empties it into Wild Bill as fast as he can pull the trigger. BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM! Bill takes all six rounds in the chest, reeling back across the cell. He hits the wall and slides down, leaving a smear, his face registering a final look of stunned surprise. Paul and the other tackle Percy and bring him down, wrestling the gun out of his hand. Dean is almost weeping:</context>

      <context>Percy is flat on his back, staring up at nothing. The black "bugs" come drifting out of nose and mouth, swirling in the air over his head. They turn white and disappear. The men are speechless. Paul turns, sees Coffey sitting on the floor at his bars, watching.</context>

      <context>The Detterick twins. Kathe and Cora. Laughing and playing hopscotch in the dust under a later afternoon sun... A dinner table. Family having supper late in the day, basket of biscuits being passed. Twelve year old Howie Detterick taking it, passing it on... An hand with a paint brush slopping bright red paint on the side of a barn... Kathe skipping to the head of the hopscotch squares, turning and starting back, laughing in the sun... The paint brush slopping more paint, dripping like blood... Paul jerks and twists, trying to pull away, trying to break the circuit, but he can't, not till all is seen and done: Marjorie Detterick calling from the porch for everybody to come eat, supper's ready... A hammer pausing. Klaus looking down from atop the barn... The Detterick twins finishing their hopscotch, gathering their jump ropes from the dust, running across the yard... The basket of biscuits being passed to little Cora, who takes a biscuit and passes it on... Klaus coming down the ladder, calling to his daughters. The little girls running past the man with the paint brush, who turns and smile as they go by...it's Wild Bill. The basket of biscuits is passed one last time. A hand pulls one out, raises it for a bite. It's Wild Bill, smiling at the little girls as conversation flows around the table... Paul screams, trying to pull away, but: The porch door is kicked off its hinges just before dawn, a figure looming in the doorway. Kathe wakes, her scream cut short as the man's fist punches her hard in the face... Paul trembles violently as if riding the lightning himself, pleading for it to stop, but there's one last thing: Wild Bill looms over the terrified little girls like a horrendous boogeyman, whispers to Kathe:</context>
      <utterance>Gots to, boss. Gots to give you a little bit of myself. A gift, like. A gift of what's in me so you can see... ...and Paul sees:</utterance>

      <context>By now, Paul is blinking back tears. Softly:</context>
      <utterance>I'm tired, boss. Tired of bein' on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain. Tired of not ever having me a buddy to be with, or tell me where we's coming from or going to, or why. Mostly I'm tired of people being ugly to each other. I'm tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world ever' day. There's too much of it. It's like pieces of glass in my head all the time.
