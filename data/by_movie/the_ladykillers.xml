      <context>The sheriff replaces the phone, leans back again, adjusts his hat, and is about to go back to sleep when we hear the front door open. The sheriff looks and reacts with genuine, if momentary, fear. He manages to compose himself and give the intruder a smile:</context>

      <utterance>I quite understand. The fact is that I saw the sign on your window advertising a room to let, and it is the only such sign among the houses of this charming, charming street.</utterance>

   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The word "band" would be, in this context, something of an anachronism. Though we do play together -- hence the word "ensemble" -- the nature of the music is such that one would hesitate to apply the epithet "band" with its connotations of jangling rhythm and ear-popping amplification.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Madam, I shudder. I quake. The revulsion I feel for modern popular music, and all other manifestations of contemporary decay, is, I have no doubt, the equal of y'own. Why, we play music that was composed to the greater glory of God. Devotional music. Church music.</utterance>

      <context>At his sign, Gawain, the custodian, emerges from the driver's side. Clark Pancake emerges from the front passenger side. The General, wearing a different but equally pressed khaki suit and ascot, and with a smoking cigarette in his lips, emerges from a back door. Gawain goes to the back of the hearse and opens its hatch to let out Lump Hudson, the football player. Lump helps unload five large and oddly shaped instrument cases, each man taking one except for Lump himself, who carries two. As the parade of losers and misfits winds its way up the walk:</context>
      <utterance>...No no, no bereavement, though it is so kind of you to enquire. No, the hearse is simply a vehicle commodious enough to accommodate all of the members of our ensemble. And of course our instruments, contrived in an age ignorant of miniaturization... He turns and gestures at the vehicle.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>After a beat the General turns away from the wall to give Dorr a look into which one might read anything, or nothing. Gawain hits play on the boombox and the cellar is filled with the fussy strains of baroque chamber music. Dorr nods.</context>
      <utterance>What do you think, General? Present any problems?</utterance>
   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He spreads a map open on the sackbutt case.</context>
      <utterance>...Good then.</utterance>
   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The biggest feature on the map is a wavy, roughly north-south pair of lines: a river. A boat icon sits at one edge and from it a dotted rectangle extends inland. Dorr taps at the boat icon with his fiddle bow.</context>
      <utterance>...All right, gentlemen, why don't we all crowd around and go over the plan.</utterance>
   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He is tracing a street that parallels the dotted rectangle extending from the boat. The street is lined by small house icons on either side; the bow comes to rest on one of those icons.</context>
      <utterance>...This, gentlemen, is the Lady Luck, gambling den, cash cow, Sodom of the Mississippi delta -- and the focus of our little exercise. Here is Orchard Street...</utterance>
   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bow taps emphasize:</context>
      <utterance>...and here is the residence of Marva Munson, the charming lady whom y'all met moments ago. Gentlemen...</utterance>
   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dorr uses the bow as a swagger stick to punctuate as he begins to pace.</context>
      <utterance>...You... are... here. Now. This brings us to this square... The bow indicates it, and then withdraws.</utterance>
   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...Gentlemen, I believe you are all aware that the Solons of the State of Mississippi, to wit, its legislature, have decreed that no gaming establishment shall be erected within its borders upon dry land. They may, however, legally float upon any watercourse defining a state boundary. But while the gambling activity itself is restricted to riverboats, no such restriction applies to the functions ancillary to this cash besotted bidnis. The casino's offices, locker rooms, facilities to cook and clean, and most importantly its counting houses- the reinforced, secret, and super secure repositories of the lucre -- may all be situated... wherever. Gawain -- where is wherever?</utterance>
   <speaker>GAWAIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dorr's smug smile fades. Testily:</context>

   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Where is the money?</utterance>
   <speaker>GAWAIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh. End of every shift pit boss brings the cash down to the hold of the ship in the locked cash box; once a day all the cash boxes're moved to the counting room.</utterance>

   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Gawain hesitates, the question's obviousness suggesting to him some trick.</context>
      <utterance>And what, to flog a horse that if not at this point dead is in mortal danger of expirin', does the dotted square represent?</utterance>
   <speaker>GAWAIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dorr's eyes close. A smile of feline contentment curls his lips. He murmurs:</context>
      <utterance>...Offices. Underground.</utterance>
   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He has pried a fistfull of dirt from the cellar wall.</context>
      <utterance>Underground... Mmm... During the casino's hours of operation the door to the counting room is fiercely guarded, and the door itself is of redoubtable Pittsburgh steel; when the casino is closed the entire underground complex is locked up and the armed guard retreats to the casino's main entrance. There, then, far from the guard, reposes the money, cosseted behind a five-inch-thick steel portal, yes, but the walls, gentlemen, the walls of that room, are but humble masonry, behind which is only the soft loamy soil deposited over the centuries by Ol' Man, the meanderin' Mississip', as it fanned its way back and forth across this great alluvial plain...</utterance>
   <speaker>DORR</speaker>

      <context>He crumbles it, letting it sift to the floor, and then, pleased with himself, he smiles.</context>

      <context>Lump looks around, then hesitantly raises his hand.</context>

   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The General acknowledges with a curt nod.</context>

      <context>Clark acknowledges verbally:</context>

      <utterance>Gawain is the proverbial "inside man". He has managed to secure a berth on the custodial staff of the Lady Luck, thereby placin' himself in a position to perform certain chores whose precise nature needn't detain us here, but whose performance shall guide this expedition to its happy conclusion.</utterance>

      <utterance>And this brings us to Lump. To look at Lump you might wonder, what function could he possibly fill, what specialized expertise could he possibly offer, to our merry little ol' band a miscreants. Well gentlemen, in a project of such magnitude and such risks, it is traditional -- nay, it is imperative -- to enlist the services of a hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute, who will be our security, our fist, our batterin' ram. Lump is our blunt instrument, and on all our behalfs I wish him a warm Mississippi welcome.</utterance>

   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...What I am about to reveal to you, you may find... shocking. Mrs. Munson, I must tell you that we are not... what we appear.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MUNSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mm-hm.</utterance>
   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We are not in fact musicians of the late Renaissance. Nor of the early or mid period. We are, in fact... criminals! Desperate men, madam! We have tunneled into the nearby offices of the Lady Luck gambling emporium and have relieved it of its treasure!</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MUNSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Lord have mercy!</utterance>
   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It is true that the Lady Luck is a den of iniquity, a painted harlot luring people into sin and exciting the vice of greed with her false promise of easy winnings. Oh, her gains are ill-gotten, yes, but I offer no excuses -- save one! We men have each pledged half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution -- the General, to a placement service for Southeast Asian refugees; Mr. Pancake to the Blue Ridge Parkway Conservancy; and Lump to the United Jewish Appeal. As compensation for use of your house we had planned to donate a full share to Bob Jones University, without burdening you with guilty knowledge by informing you of same. But you have wrested the information from me! Now it is all on the table. Now you have it, the whole story, the awful truth.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MUNSON</speaker>

   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, yes, shamefully I admit it, yes! But find the victim, Mrs. Munson, I challenge you! Even the casino itself, that riparian Gomorra, shall suffer no harm! It has an insurance company, a financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults! That is its function! And the insurance company itself is made up of tens and tens of thousands of policy-holders so that -- we have done the calculations, Mrs. Munson! -- so that at the end of the day, at the final reckoning, each policy- holder shall have contributed only one penny -- one single solitary cent -- to the satisfaction of this claim.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MUNSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...Just one penny?</utterance>
   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Think of it, Mrs. Munson! One cent from thousands upon thousands of people so that Bob Jones University can continue on its mission! Why, I have no doubt that, were the policy- holders aware of the existence of that august institution, why, each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount to the furtherance of its aims!</utterance>

      <context>Mrs. Munson nods, musing.</context>
      <utterance>Yes madam, sadly, the criminal stain is upon my soul, but the benefit shall accrue to any number of worthy causes. As long, that is, as the secret stays with us. And I, surely, shall not be the one to divulge it.</utterance>

   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He looks around.</context>
      <utterance>Well... I suppose you are right. It is the active nature of the crime, though, that so horrifies -- the squeezing of the trigger, the plunging of the knife. But, think a moment -- look at the other tools we have at hand.</utterance>
   <speaker>DORR</speaker>

      <utterance>Sure, easiest thing in the world. I could whip up a little mortar in one of those snow saucers, lay the bricks, anchor in some chains, Mountain has a source for the manacles...</utterance>
   <speaker>DORR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He looks around the table. Silence. No volunteers.</context>
      <utterance>Ahh but gentlemen, we delude ourselves. Think of the woman's piteous moans as we lay tier upon tier of brick. Think of her lamentations as we fit the last brick into place, appealing to our better selves, the higher angels of our nature, our recollections of our own sainted mothers... No, I fear that we lack the sand to commit such an act. No... no... shortest and most painless is best. Let us confront reality. Gawain's gun... the retort muffled by a pillow... into the brain... the affair of an instant. The only question is... who wields the weapon.</utterance>
   <speaker>DORR</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>...I'm thinking, though, that since I lost my finger -- I mean, literally lost it because of that goddamn cat -- maybe I should be excused from this thing. Hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway--</utterance>

   <speaker>PANCAKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>With a flap of his cape the professor jumbles the straws and encloses them in one hand. Sweaty CLOSE-UPS. Each man stares at the straws. Some hesitant, some resolute, they draw: First, the General: long straw. His reaction: impassive. Next, Lump: long straw. His reaction: relieved. Next, Pancake. Long straw.</context>

   <speaker>GAWAIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He touches the other straw, hesitates. He goes back to the first straw, closes his hand around it, closes his eyes, and pulls. He lifts the straw into frame before his squeezed-shut eyes, raises his eyebrows, and slowly opens fluttering eyelids to look: short straw. The Professor, smiling, opens his fist to confirm that he holds the last long one. Gawain moans.</context>

But at the end of the day, your position prevailed, and the men have decided that we shall return the money -- every last cent of it! -- and attend Sunday services, rather than spend the remainder of our years wasting away in the Mississippi Men's Correctional Facility.

      <context>The Professor, seeing that the General and Lump have made it out the door, is anxious to wind things up:</context>

      <context>Through the living room window he can see the hearse pulling away from the curb. There is another car -- an old Volkswagon microbus -- slowly tooling the opposite way down the street. Dorr looks back to Mrs. Munson.</context>
      <utterance>So the money shall be returned tomorrow at the opening of the casino office. Enjoy your tea, madam... Backing out, he looks to one side.</utterance>
