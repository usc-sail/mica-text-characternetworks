   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Talley lifts a dedicated crisis phone that's been hardlined into the house, his tone reasonable and friendly --</context>
      <utterance>No one's going anywhere, L-T. We can talk this guy down.</utterance>

   <speaker>LEIFITZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Frustrated, Talley slumps back against the van as the SWAT Intelligence Officer, Lloyd Keith, scuttles up to them --</context>
      <utterance>I don't think he wants to talk.</utterance>

   <speaker>KEITH</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>She didn't take the kid to her sister's. The neighbors were wrong.</utterance>

      <utterance>Goddamnit, you said we had her. I told him we had her!</utterance>
   <speaker>KEITH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Up at the house, George Edward Malik steps into the window. Malik is a forty-year-old freaked-out loser who has turned the corner on insanity --</context>
      <utterance>We got bad information, Talley. I can't pull her out of my ass!</utterance>
   <speaker>LEIFITZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Talley ignores Leifitz; he is totally focused on Malik and on defusing the situation --</context>
      <utterance>Talley! You're in the line of fire!</utterance>
   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I didn't lie to you, George. You scared your wife pretty good last night. We're having a hard time finding her.</utterance>

      <utterance>You and I have been talking for, what, sixteen hours? Keep talking. Is that your dog, too?</utterance>
   <speaker>MALIK'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't know whose dog it is. She lied about everything else, so she probably lied about the dog.</utterance>
   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We'll have her talk to you.</context>
      <utterance>I know you're hurting. You lose your job, you find out your wife's fucking another guy . . . but don't give up.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALIK'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Something about Malik's statement bothers Talley. The wording is odd, suspicious --</context>
      <utterance>Then why won't she open her mouth?! Why doesn't the bitch say something???</utterance>

   <speaker>MARS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dennis lunges across the counter, grabbing Kim's gun, and the two men are suddenly locked in a ferocious death-struggle for possession of the weapon --</context>
      <utterance>He's got a gun!</utterance>
   <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dennis and Kim bounce from the counter to the Slurpy machine, the Glock locked between them, pointing first one way, then the other, their eyes meeting as -- BAM -- the gun goes off. Junior Kim's eyes widen. Dennis and Junior both look down at the red blossom that grows on Junior Kim's chest --</context>
      <utterance>Mars, help me --</utterance>
   <speaker>KEVIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Kim falls into the Slurpy machine, then slides to the floor. Dennis scrambles over the counter and sprints for the door. But Mars hesitates. Instead of running, he picks up Kim's gun, then leans over the counter to look at Kim's body. We cannot see his face --</context>

      <context>Talley shifts his aim back and forth between the two men. He has his back to the wall and the Fat Man in front of him --</context>
      <utterance>Don't shoot! Don't shoot him!</utterance>
   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>All three men are sucking air like freight engines. No one is shooting, but if one person fires, everyone will fire. Everybody has something the other guy wants. That's the only thing holding them back --</context>
      <utterance>Where's my family?! Where's my family, you fuck?!</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Take it easy. Just take it easy. We're here to do business.</utterance>
   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Howell releases his grip on the gun, and lets it swing free on his finger. He's trying to cool Talley --</context>
      <utterance>You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They're close. Let me make a call. You can see they're okay.</utterance>
   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Howell takes out his phone and presses a number. Talley shifts his aim from Howell to the Fat Man to Manelli --</context>
      <utterance>You said they would be here!</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Howell offers the phone, but Talley is wary--he can't let go of the Fat Man and he won't put down his pistol. Howell carefully holds the phone to Talley's ear --</context>
      <utterance>Put on the woman.</utterance>
   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Jane?</utterance>
   <speaker>JANE'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Jeff, we're -- Howell backs away with the phone --</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Talley takes out a single disk. It's the one labeled 'Marlon.' He tosses it onto the bed --</context>
      <utterance>You have the disks?</utterance>
   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You get the other one when I have my girls. Not talk to them; have them.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Where is it?</utterance>
   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Howell considers the disk. If Talley has the second disk in his pocket, Howell could just shoot him. But Howell can't be sure --</context>
      <utterance>Close.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Howell brings the disk to a lap top computer set up in the corner. He inserts the disk, and waits for it to read. He's satisfied with what he sees --</context>
      <utterance>I have to see if it's real.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWELL</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All right. Now the second one.</utterance>
   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Howell stares at Talley again, then picks up his phone --</context>
      <utterance>First my girls. I get my girls, you get the other disk.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWELL</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Aim your gun at the woman's head. If he doesn't give me the disk, kill her. Marion presses a gun to Jane's temple -- Talley jerks his gun toward Howell --</utterance>
   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll kill you! You won't get the other disk!</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Talley aims at the man in the car; he aims at Howell. He tried so hard to save his family, and now Howell has him boxed --</context>
      <utterance>If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter. Do you want to lose both of them?</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWELL</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Talley looks at Jane and Amanda, and his eyes fill. He mouths the words --</context>
      <utterance>The negotiation is over, Talley. I won. Now give me the disk or he'll put her brain on the glass.</utterance>
   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Talley drops his gun and releases the Fat Man, who stumbles away. Talley tosses a second disk onto the bed. Manelli scoops it up and tosses it to Howell as Mation appears in the door --</context>
      <utterance>I love you. He's saying good-bye.</utterance>
   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the real FBI. This one's a fake.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Howell anxiously pushes the disk into his lap top --</context>
      <utterance>You'd better be kidding.</utterance>
   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Howell stares at the lap top with the withering face of a man reading his own death sentence. There is nothing on this disk.</context>
      <utterance>I'm a cop, you asshole! What did you expect me to do? Pretend all this never happened?</utterance>
   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Howell stands like a mechanical man; incredulous --</context>
      <utterance>Benza's over. You're over. I just want to take my family home.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Are you out of your mind?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARION</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Howell looks over as if seeing Marion for the first time, and gives him the order --</context>
      <utterance>You fucked up, Glen.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Marion aims his gun directly between Talley's eyes, then points it at Howell --</context>
      <utterance>Kill them.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARION</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Marion shoots Howell in the head, then the Fat Man, then Manelli--bambambam--one shot, one kill. He lowers his gun, considers Talley. Talley doesn't move.</context>
      <utterance>No fuckups allowed.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARION</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's like a storm, isn't it? This raging force that you can't control does whatever it wants, and the best you can do is survive. A winner survives.</utterance>
   <speaker>TALLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The question being: Why aren't I dead? Why aren't you killing me?</context>
      <utterance>Why...?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARION</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Marion considers Talley another moment --</context>
      <utterance>What good would it do to kill you? The police already have the disk.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARION</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Marion goes to his car. He helps out Jane and Amanda, then gets into his car and drives away.</context>
      <utterance>Your wife is a very nice lady.</utterance>
