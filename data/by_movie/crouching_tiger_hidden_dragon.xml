      <context></context>
      <utterance>During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared. I had come to a place my master had never told me about.</utterance>
   <speaker>YU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You were enlightened?</utterance>
   <speaker>LI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No. I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment. Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow. I couldn't bear it. I broke off my meditation. I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.</utterance>

      <utterance>We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Li unwraps the object. It is an ancient, astonishingly beautiful sword.</context>
      <utterance>Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.</utterance>
   <speaker>YU</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>First I must visit my master's grave. It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him. I have yet to avenge his death. And yet I'm thinking of quitting. I must pray for his forgiveness.</utterance>

      <context>Governor Yu is impressed by the opulence and elegance of the sword. He closes his eyes to guess the weight of the sword. Te snubs out the flame from a candle, then slides the sword out from its sheath. The sword gives off a luminous blue glow in the dark.</context>

      <utterance>The Imperial Court isn't the problem. With royalty and officials everywhere, the Royal Guard keeps security tight. But Peking is not like the West. Here, you'll find all sorts of characters. Proceed with caution in your quest for law and order. Don't depend only on the court. Contacts in the Giang Hu underworld can ensure your position.

I want you to be mine forever. I will make my mark on the world. I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend. Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish. Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped. He didn't die. He wasn't even hurt. He floated away, far away, never to return. He knew his wish had come true. If you believe, it will happen. The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."</utterance>

      <utterance>How dare you accuse us? I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family. And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt. Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him. We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all!</utterance>
   <speaker>JEN</speaker>

      <context>Jen gets up to leave. Yu intercepts her.</context>

      <context>Yu scoops up a weapon from one of many lying around and begins her battle with Jen. Yu uses every weapon that's available against Jen but none are any match for the Green Destiny.

      <context>Yu picks up a huge broad sword and attacks. Just as the Green Destiny slices it in half, Yu holds the broken blade at Jen's neck. She pauses before hurting Jen, then pulls back.</context>

      <context>Li suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree. The bamboo straightens up and throws Jen toward the ground. Jen quickly pulls herself up and charges at Li. Jen chases after Li, into a clearing, out of the bamboo forest.</context>

      <context>Jen dives in to retrieve it. He follows Jen downstream by hopping from one rock to another. Jen recovers the sword but is herself drowning.
