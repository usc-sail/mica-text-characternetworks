   <speaker>VOICE OVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The terrified Mexican stands frozen on one side of Blanchard, trying to avoid the entire mess as the policeman parries the marines' blows with his own truncheon.</context>
      <utterance>I already knew him by reputation, had our respective records down pat: Lee Blanchard, 43-4-2 as a heavyweight, formerly a regular attraction at the Hollywood Legion Stadium.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEE BLANCHARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bucky runs into the courtyard and immediately wades in, fending off the marines' blows to jab at them with his stick.</context>

   <speaker>VOICE OVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>On instinct, Bucky drops his baton and begins wailing on the marines with his fists, connecting hard punches with soft midsections. VOICE OVER (cont'd) In our first year at Central we'd never spoke--but people spoke of us. Opinions about a fantasy Bleichert-Blanchard fight, and who would win. And now Blanchard moves in, lashing vicious truncheon blows to the shoulders of the marines, sending them one by one into a heap. VOICE OVER (cont'd) I'd heard almost all of 'em: Blanchard by early KO; Bleichert by decision; Blanchard stopped on cuts--everything but Bleichert by knockout. The marines reduced to rubble, Lee Blanchard turns his attention to the Zooter: he slaps handcuffs on him and leads him away. He motions for Bucky to follow. Lee turns back to the marines:</context>
      <utterance>And he knew me, Bucky Bleichert, light- heavy, 36-0-0, ranked tenth by Ring magazine in 1937 fighting no-name opponents in no-man's-land division.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>One of them flips Lee off. The Zooter kicks him in the chest as Lee pulls him away from them, laughing. The three men start back toward the riots. Gunshots can be heard. Palm trees blaze up into the night. LEE (cont'd) (re the Zooter) Bucky Bleichert, meet Senor Tomas Dos Santos, subject of an all-points fugitive warrant for manslaughter committed during the commission of a Class B Felony. Snatched a purse off a hairbag and she keeled of a heart attack.</context>

      <utterance>What's your best guess?</utterance>
   <speaker>CORONER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Here's what she wasn't. She wasn't raped, she wasn't pregnant, dried semen indicates voluntary intercourse within the last week...She took what I'd call a gentle whipping in the last ten days...In terms of the nitty-gritty...She was probably tortured with a knife for thirty- six to forty-eight hours before death. The cause of which is either the mouth wound or more likely she was beaten to death with something like a baseball bat.</utterance>

      <context>Bucky blows a hole in a vase some six inches from her. He cocks his head at her, as if to say: the next one will be closer.</context>

      <context>The dig crosses through Bucky's mind for a moment before he shooes it away. To Emmett:</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>probably a knife, and the Bleichert fists would've given way to a full load of .45 in the chest. Bucky and Russ step outside. Russ lights a match and tosses it inside. Flames begin to eat away the bloody mattress... VOICE OVER (cont'd) Sprague said they found him croaked in a parking lot downtown, just twelve blocks from where he'd dumped Betty Short. Just croaked. Natural causes, if anything about crazy Georgie was natural. I hoped the evil ate him from the inside out, filling him with blackness like the sawdust in Sprague's goddamn dog. (beat) Bucky kicks the tin door shut, sealing the fire inside Elizabeth Short's private hell.</context>
      <utterance>Maybe he'd have gone for a gun or</utterance>
   <speaker>JANE CHAMBERS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They laugh, Jane a bit more than Bucky. She narrows in on him. JANE CHAMBERS (cont'd) It's so nice of you to stop by again. Of course you've been staking out the Sprague house. Four nights in a row. (off his surprise) I walk my dog every night. And I'm almost as nosy as you.</context>
      <utterance>...and then Eldridge said: I'm sure that's the case Mr. Mayor, but that's not my dog and those sure as hell aren't my shoes!</utterance>

   <speaker>BUCKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She smiles. Very slowly she withdraws one of her hands from the folds of her dressing gown. She holds a tiny ladylike revolver in her fingers and drops it at her feet. When she speaks, it's with complete control.</context>
      <utterance>I know what you did, Ramona. You and Georgia. I've seen the painting. You sold it the day of the murder. You know I've got the book. And now I've got you.</utterance>
   <speaker>RAMONA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We see you out there, you know. Every night. We see you. You don't fool us. You didn't hurt Georgie. You didn't hurt Madeleine. And as much as I wish you would, you didn't hurt Emmett. You're a voyeur. That's all the lesser classes have. Pressing their nose up against the glass.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUCKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She smiles at him again, loving his need.</context>
      <utterance>So tell me. Let me see.</utterance>
   <speaker>RAMONA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bucky eases himself into a chair opposite her.</context>
      <utterance>Emmett slashed his face, I'm sure you know. Madeleine was eleven and she looked just like Georgie. When he got out of the hospital I gave him the Hugo book as a present. My Gwynplain. But he was afraid of Emmett's rage...After that...we rarely spoke.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUCKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tell me about Betty Short. Her face hardens. RAMONA   It was the cruelest of jokes. He'd become obsessed with her...That filthy film.</utterance>

      <utterance>For being richer than he was. She looks over her nose at him. RAMONA  I followed them to the bungalow. There was a baseball bat under...under a tree...She tried to run from me...but she was drunk. The first swing knocked her out. I made Georgie tie her to the mattress....The second swing woke her up.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUCKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She looked so much like my Maddy. It was...the cruelest of jokes. Her thousand yard stare gradually returns to Bucky. RAMONA (cont'd) Martha mustn't know. She's all that's left of this family that isn't dying. You consider her when you decide whether we're worth it. Bucky's not sure what to say next. She fills the space quite well. RAMONA (cont'd) Honestly, though. Sometimes I thought Martha was going to bring the whole family down around her by chance. Her little stunt about tipping the police to LaVerne's--</context>
      <utterance>You tortured her. She seems to drift. RAMONA</utterance>
   <speaker>BUCKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ramona's eyes brighten up.</context>
      <utterance>She lied about that. To get Madeleine's goat.</utterance>

      <context>She speaks with such an insanity and calm it frightens him. And on Bucky's hungry eyes we</context>
