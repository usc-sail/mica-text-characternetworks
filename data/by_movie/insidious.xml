It pops free, shooting across the room like a kernel of popcorn...followed by another tack. The second tack lands in Josh's lap. Puzzled, he picks it up, examining it. He looks up, his eye drawn to the picture on the wall. With total astonishment, he sees the two remaining tacks works themselves free, popping out of the wall. The drawing floats down to the ground. Josh stoops down, picking it up. It is a drawing split into two halves. The left half is a self portrait of Dalton, lying in bed, looking down from above. The right half is a depiction of outer space - squiggly stars and bloated planets. Dalton has drawn another version of himself on this side, flying above the house with another man. At the bottom of the first drawing, Dalton has written `Last night I watched myself sleep'. A tear falls down Josh's face. He begins to cry. Deep and painful tears he has long pent up. Beneath the second drawing, Dalton has written `Then I flew away.'</context>

One of the cameras on the tripod goes off, bathing the room in white light for a split second. Elise inhales and exhales deeply, slipping away. Soon, she is very still. Specs nods to Tucker silently, then produces an odd looking device made from GREY CLOTH. It almost resembles a gas mask from World War 1, with a cone shaped muzzle that fits over the mouth and nose. The snout of the facemask is like an elongated elephant trunk, coiling outwards and ending in an old listening device, like an early version of a microphone. Specs slips two hooks over Elise's ears and gently places the device over her nose and mouth. He then takes a seat next to her, behind Renai, who holds Elise's hand. Specs takes out his notepad and fixes a small apparatus around his neck that holds a flashlight in place.</context>

      <context>She spins around and lifts Tucker's camera up to her face, aiming it at him. She depresses the trigger and takes a photo of him, bathing the whole corridor in white light. Josh recoils back in shock. Elise lowers the camera. She is terrified. Josh suddenly LUNGES at her, slapping the camera out of her hands.</context>
      <utterance>What's the matter, Elise?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOSH</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He SLAMS her against the wall, his hands around her throat. Elise chokes in terror, terrified of him.</context>
      <utterance>Why the fuck would you do that? Why would you do that? Why?!</utterance>
   <speaker>JOSH</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He abruptly stops attacking her, staggering backwards, examining his hands as if he can't believe what he's done. Seething with fury. Panting. Elise collapses, catching her breath. Josh swipes a framed photo off the wall and storms away, heading down the corridor... ...swallowed up by the darkness.</context>
      <utterance>You of all people! You know! Why would you do that to me when you know what you know? You bitch!</utterance>

      <context>She spins around and lifts Tucker's camera up to her face, aiming it at him.

For a beat, the Old Woman just glares at her... ...then she CHARGES at Elise, arms outstretched, wrapping her white hands around the soft flesh of Elise's throat. Elise CHOKES, eyes bulging, spittle flying from her mouth, as the pale hands of the Old Woman dig into her thorax, droplets of blood running down her chest where the yellowing finger- nails have CUT IN to the flesh. The Old Woman smiles - a merciless harlequin grin that mocks Elise's pain. She lets Elise go, letting her drop to the floor. The Old Woman turns and glares down the corridor. Something has caught her attention. A distant scream.</context>
