      <context>ON a GUN, leveled. .We don't see by whom. The trigger is pulled. The bullet strikes Nix's back and explodes out of his chest. ON SWANN, staring at Nix. SWANN'S P.O.V. of Nix, as the aura of light dies. Just for a moment - a terrible moment - Swann glimpses something else. MORPHING out of Nix's features. A NIGHTMARE FACE with waves of DARKNESS emanating from the middle of its forehead. Swann covers his eyes.</context>

      <context>He clamps one of the pieces over Nix's EYES. It fits like an eyeless mask. Nix thrashes and SCREAMS. Swann lays his hands on the side of the mask, and — LIKE MAGIC -- his touch makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into Nix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND. BLOOD runs from the screw-holes.</context>
      <utterance>Binding you.</utterance>

      <context>He's silenced. The piece screws itself into-his head, like the first. And now comes the third and final piece: over the nose and into the ears. Again, it screws itself into place. Swann has done all he can. He retreats from Nix's body, as it continues to convulse. We go from face to ashen face, as each man and woman watches and waits. Why won't he die? And now, at last the violence of Nix's death-throes diminishes. Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies.</context>

      <utterance>Ever watched a man die? If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.</utterance>

      <context>As this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the door and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other side. It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being pitched across the room. He looks around for some means of defense. There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the table. Behind it a WINDOW.</context>
      <utterance>Pimm's dead. Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared. They knew the Puritan was coming home.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUTTERFIELD</speaker>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly, Harry steps aside. The door's flung open. Miller CHARGES in. Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him against the drape. The window CRACKS; the drape comes down around Miller. Amber STREETLIGHT floods in. Butterfield is momentarily distracted. Harry STRIKES the scalpel from his hands. Miller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the folds of the drapes. Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's belly. Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window, which SHATTERS. Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT. Harry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already making his escape. Harry starts after him.</context>
      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUAID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He turns back. TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry goes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the stairs.</context>

      <context>A vortex of SMOKE and LIGHT swirls in the middle of the stage. The vortex BLAZES -- And suddenly Swann SWEEPS DOWN out of the flies, as the floor of the stage opens and the head of a glittering, razor toothed DRAGON emerges in a cloud of CRIMSON SMOKE. Swann raises his hands above his head and a SPEAR miraculously appears in his grasp. He descends on the dragon. It's a classic image: St. Michael smiting the Devil. Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon. The theatre SHAKES at its dying ROARS. Then the head cracks open, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily dressed DANCERS, male and female. Swann throws down the spear, and where it strikes the stage his PANTHER appears. A ROAR of APPLAUSE from the audience. Swann's plain white tunic falls away from him as he descends. By the time his feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot TUXEDO. The PANTHER licks his hand in welcome. The MUSIC comes to a crescendo. The DANCERS freeze in their erotic dance. In the sudden hush, Swann speaks in a whisper.</context>

      <context>Ever-eager, Billy steps into the recess. And -- two spiked, latticed gates close on his arm! Harry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from skewering Billy's flesh and bone! He keeps them open, his sinews straining.</context>

      <utterance>That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Reluctantly, Billy does so. Harry picks up a faded PHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nix's HOUSE (with the sigil painted on it) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun. There are other CULTISTS standing around. And in the DOORWAY -- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for that) - is NIX.</context>

   <speaker>HARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Billy is getting subtly spooked now. He puts the etching down and starts to go through others in the series. We glimpse them as he does so. In one, a MAN regurgitates a serpentine form made of FLAME. In another, a MAN stares at his own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH. There is no bone beneath. Only a form of solid blackness. In a third, we see a HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Out of the corner of his eye. Harry sees a motion between the book-stacks. Billy frowns. Harry puts his fingers to his lips. Gestures for Billy to take cover. Billy backs away. Harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion. Something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks. A figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed. Harry takes out his gun. Billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks. Harry goes after the apparition. The TRACK is completely silent. Suddenly, the creature appears behind Billy! It looks up, its face that of a psychotic: burning eyes, manic smile. It tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who backs away.</context>

   <speaker>BILLY</speaker>

      <context>ON NIX, as he looks up at Dorothea. ON DOROTHEA, as she raises the GUN. She FIRES. The bullet STRIKES Nix's FOREHEAD. He sinks to his knees, BLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE used to be. ON HARRY, as Nix's mind-hold falters. He leans against the wall, shaking.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Harry and Dorothea start to get up... Nix is no longer human. He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS, stripped of features. He opens his mouth, the only visible element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an utterly inhuman SHRIEK!</context>
      <utterance>Oh my God.</utterance>
   <speaker>SWANN</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Harry glances through the door into the Meditation Room. Swann is on the threshold. Nix RISES now. He is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form. He comes at Dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into the Meditation Room.</context>

      <context>ON DOROTHEA. She's a couple of yards from the pit now.</context>
      <utterance>Try.</utterance>
   <speaker>NIX</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Suddenly, Harry lunges at Nix, grabbing hold of his legs. Nix topples. ON SWANN, who puts his hands on the ground. Closes his eyes. A wave of LIQUIFICATION runs through the ground from Swann's broken fingers -- -- the Cultists' bodies MOVE in the softening ground, like corpses in surf, and ROLL towards the pit, their dead faces resurfacing -- Barbara's body floats past Nix, and disappears over the edge of the pit.</context>
      <utterance>I'm beyond Heaven. I'm beyond Hell.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The ground is very liquid now, and the corpses are lodging around Nix as they're all carried towards the pit. So's Harry, of course. Nix tries to get up, but he's too late. The corpses weigh him down, the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper hold, and Harry still clings to his legs.</context>
      <utterance>Get out of here!</utterance>
   <speaker>NIX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He's at the edge of the pit.</context>

   <speaker>DOROTHEA</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Harry looks round. Dorothea's behind him, risking the flowing ground to offer him a hand. Nix starts to fall into the pit. At the last minute, he reaches for Harry, as -- -- Harry is pulled out of reach bv Dorothea. Together they stumble to THE DOOR, where Swann still lies. They look back to see NIX, as he goes over the edge of the pit and FALLS SCREAMING. At the door, Dorothea lifts up Swann's head. He's dead. She closes his eyes.</context>

      <context>No it's not. Nix keeps falling, breaking through another layer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the earth. And now... there's a hint of FIERY LIGHT below. He's approaching MAGMA.</context>
