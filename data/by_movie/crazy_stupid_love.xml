      <utterance>Did you know your kids are the only ones I baby-sit for who always want to stay awake so they can see their dad when he gets home. I mean, they fight with everything they have to keep their eyes open so they can hear what Dad had for dinner, or how he liked the movie. Lot of kids want to stay awake for Mom -- and your kids always want to see you, don't get me wrong -- but not a lot wait up for Dad. Maybe it's because he's good, and he's kind, and he's decent.</utterance>

      <utterance>Strained. I took a summer internship up at Stanford, gonna head up there early. Figure it can't hurt to get out of his line of sight for a while.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROBBIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, probably a good idea.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROBBIE</speaker>
      <mode>THEN</mode>
      <context>He holds out his hand, to shake, formally.</context>
      <utterance>You were a good baby-sitter, Jessica. I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.</utterance>

      <utterance>Wait: I thought you weren't giving up.</utterance>

      <context>Jessica smiles.</context>
      <utterance>I'm not. But I figure: you like my dad, and one day I'll look like my dad, so I'll just come for you then.</utterance>
   <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She looks over her shoulder, reaches into her purse.</context>
      <utterance>It's a good plan.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>She hands him something in an ENVELOPE: the same type of envelope she once used for... Robbie peeks inside. His eyes BUG OUT. Jessica kisses him, sweetly, on the cheek.</context>
      <utterance>Until then: a little graduation gift. To help get you through high school.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Robbie watches her go. Love-struck once more. Cal steps up next to his son.</context>

      <utterance>Things are just so messed up. And it's been such a strange year. I've been in such a strange place. And we have all these problems, so many problems I've lost count, but at the end of the day, I mean, the only thing I know -- She stops herself, emotional. Then, simply:</utterance>
