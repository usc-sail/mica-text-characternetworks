      <context>The CAMERA glances off photos of the couple: portraits and candids, their wedding day, with friends, on vacation, tumbling on the lawn, and the like. Some framed and hung, some taped to the fridge or simply leaning on a shelf. It's clear that at least a handful are by the same photographer, black and whites, grainy and beautiful. There are lots of photos of Joe and his sister Lucy, documenting their relationship from childhood. There's an ANNIE LEIBOWITZ photo-shoot of Sally carelessly displayed somewhere.</context>
      <utterance>It's yours.</utterance>

   <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>

      <utterance>And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again? Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again. If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park. Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right. It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left. Sally's started the bath, and is watching him from the doorway. He meets her eyes mid-sentence.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He rolls his eyes. Sally walks back into the bathroom, she isn't buying it.</context>
      <utterance>Oh? I don't think tonight. I'm sure they're well behaved. All our friends have dogs, and they always want to bring them. We'd be outnumbered, you see? So we sort of put a ban on it. Sorry.</utterance>

      <context>Clair picks up discarded dinner plates. Otis takes care of those behind couches, under tables. The gifts are stacked high, near the fireplace. Sally is on the floor, nestled between Joe's knees, leaning back against him. His arms are wrapped around her, face pressed against hers. There's a SERIES OF CUTS through speeches, gifts, entertainment. Sophia and Cal do a well rehearsed, very funny, impromptu something with their kids. Panes and Mac do an interpretive dance symbolizing the marriage. Cal and Sophia carry sleeping children down the hall.

   <speaker>CAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script. She can barely get the lines out. There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take. I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe. Something's gone. You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you. It's gone. I think she's scared. And that's death.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films. But those were all such great directors.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mac's a pretty great director, Joe. He's a woman's director. And nothing's happening. Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed. He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What?</utterance>
   <speaker>CAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, listen, I love her. She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright. I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids. That is so great. Maybe that's what this is all about. Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore. You know adults don't do this for a living. You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough. Sophia knew that intuitively. Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural. Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be. "Life is but a walking shadow. A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?</utterance>
