      <utterance>The '57 meeting was about how we were going to divide up the whole country. This meeting is about how we're gonna survive. You got 'made' guys informing for the Feds; bosses going to jail; everybody's dealing drugs; people are getting whacked without permission. And on top of everything, now we got the Chinese Triads and these crazy Russians to deal with. Everything's changing. We need a leader. Someone with fresh ideas. Someone like you. It's gonna be a new century, Paul.</utterance>

He's what I'm thinking about when I wake up, and he's what I'm thinking about when I close my eyes to sleep. If he told me to jump off a tall building, not only would I do it, I would hope to survive so I could do it again and again until he told me to stop. This is all I know. This is all I got.
