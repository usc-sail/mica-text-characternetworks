      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't start, alright! This is a cool moment, and I'd appreciate you not trying to ruin it. How often does a guy get the opportunity to purchase something with his name on it!  Banky Edwards- right!  Holden McNeil.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>C'mon, sour puss. We got the rest of our lives to be artists. But it's supply and demand. And right now, the unwashed masses demand this.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This is easy, alright! And right now it pays the bills. Just don't forget that we're better than this.</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They approach the counter, where STEVE-DAVE, the store manager, and WALT the Fan-boy, play a card game.</context>
      <utterance>I'll tell you who we're better than: these two fags right here.</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>

      <utterance>Alright Old-Maid's - take a break from the Crazy-8's marathon and ring us up.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, well,well, Walt Did you see who it is! The local celebrities. Quick - get them to autograph one of their books so we can sell it for triple it's value.</utterance>
   <speaker>WALT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They snicker and high-five one another. Holden rolls his eyes.</context>
      <utterance>I'm not that in need of fifteen cents right now.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>For your information, we're playing Crimson Mystical Mages' - an overpower card game. Not that either of you would give a shit about something as advanced as this - there are no dick or poopie jokes involved.</utterance>

      <utterance>No, we're not. You're both a couple of fucking no talents that got lucky.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE-DAVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And obviously your handlers or hangers- on convinced you that your first comic was good which it was not it was thoroughly mediocre with a few spiky bits of dialogue. And when you get your foot in the door of the business, what do you do! You turn out a piece of shit like Bluntman and Chronic'.</utterance>
   <speaker>WALT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tell him, Steve-Dave.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE-DAVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Bluntman and Chronic'. Pah. What was that thing the little stoner pulled on the villain in the last issue!</utterance>

      <utterance>The Stinky-palm.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Stinky-palm. You give comics a bad name I tell all my customers not to buy it, to spend their money on a real comic book.</utterance>

      <utterance>Fucking one hit wonder, dime-store Frank Miller's.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This is the reality at Comic-Toast - you're not going to get your ass kissed here, because both me and Walt think you suck.</utterance>
   <speaker>WALT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And me.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE-DAVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Steve-Dave offers the boys his two middle fingers, then goes back to playing his game with Walt. Holden and Banky stare, shocked. Banky nudges Holden and they both exit Steve-Dave and the Fan-boy slap hands and go back to playing.</context>
      <utterance>I said that.</utterance>
   <speaker>WALT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I've got a dragon card - forty power- ups and twelve life points! Ha! I get your elf card!</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're such a bitch! But thankfully, I've saved a dark forces Shaman card for just such an occasion.</utterance>

      <utterance>You suck! Eighty six life-power points to my twenty two!</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE-DAVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly. A trash can crashes through the front window. Steve-Dave and Walt hit the deck like bitches, covering one another. They look up slowly. Steve-Dave leaps to his feet and looks at the shattered mess. He pulls something off the garbage can and reads it.</context>
      <utterance>I schooled their asses, now I'm schooling your's.</utterance>
   <speaker>WALT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You know it was those two fucks! Let's call the cops and have them busted! I know where their studio is! Or better yet, let's sue! You can sue them, Steve-Dave!</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE-DAVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That won't be necessary.</utterance>

      <utterance>What?! Why the hell not!</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE-DAVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Because this is a check for three times what that window cost.  Dear critics - thanks for the insight. But like my grandmother always said - Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.. and break their window.' Kiss it, Banky the Hack. P.S. - Your card game blows.</utterance>

      <context>Holden sits at a table. Across from the barely-managing- to-stand Fan. He offers him a patronizingly kind, half- smile in return,</context>
      <utterance>Could you sign it To a really big fan!</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We're at a Comic Book show, specifically at a book- signing. Behind Holden hangs a large banner, heralding HOLDEN McNEIL AND BANKY EDWARDS - CREATORS OF BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC'. Beside it is a large mock-up of the comic book cover which features two stoner super-heroes who bear a striking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly neighborhood drug dealers, Holden hands the book back to the Fan.</context>
      <utterance>You bet.</utterance>
   <speaker>FAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I love this book man! This shit's awesome. I wish I was like these guys - getting stoned, talking all raw about chicks and fighting supervillains! I love these guys! They're like Cheech and Chong' meet Bill and fed'!</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>

   <speaker>COLLECTOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So you draw this!</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I ink it and I'm also the colorist. The guy next to me draws it. But we both came up with the characters,</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's that mean - you ink it'!</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well. It means that Holden draws the pictures in pencil, and then he gives it to me to go over in ink</utterance>
   <speaker>COLLECTOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Banky freezes up. He composes himself and continues signing.</context>
      <utterance>So you just trace!</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's not tracing. I add depth and shading to give the image mere definition. Only then does the drawing really take shape.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLLECTOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You go over what he draws with a pen - that's tracing.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>For years in this industry whenever an African-American character - hero or villain - was introduced usually by white artists and writers - they got slapped with racist names that singled them out as negroes: Black Panther, Black Lightning, Black Goliath, Black Mantra, Black Talon, Black Spider, Black Hand, Black Falcon, Black Cat..</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE FROM CROWD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>She's white.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOOPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Well bust this - regardless. We're at a panel discussion. The room is full. Five creators sit at a long table, their names on placards in front of them. (One of them is a very striking Girl.) The banner behind them reads WORDS UP - MINORITY VOICES IN COMICS'.</context>
      <utterance>She is?</utterance>
   <speaker>HOOPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now my book, White-Hating Coon', doesn't have any of that bullshit. The hero's name is Maleekwa, and he's a descendant of the black tribe that established the first society on the planet, while all you European mother fuckers were still hiding in caves and shit, all terrified of the sun. He's a strong role model that a young black reader can look up to, Cause I'm here to tell you - the chickens are comin' home to roost, ya'll: the black man's no longer gonna play the minstrel in the medium of comics and Sci- Fi/Fantasy! We're keeping it real, and we're gonna get respect - by any means necessary! During the speech, Holden and Banky enter and sit up front.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Bullshit! Lando Calrissian was a black man, and he got to fly the Millennium Falcon! Hooper whips his head around, looking for the source of the comment</utterance>

      <utterance>I did! Lando Calrissian is a positive black role model in the realm of Science Fiction/Fantasy.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Fuck Lando Calrissian! Uncle Tom nigger! Always some white boy gotta invoke the holy trilogy'! Bust this - those movies are about how the white man keeps the brother man down - even in a galaxy far, far away. Check this shit. You got cracker farm-boy Luke Skywalker, Nazi poster boy - blond hair, blue eyes. And then you've got Darth Vader: the blackest brother in the galaxy. Nubian God.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Shut the fuck up! Now Vader, he's a spiritual brother, with the force and all that shit. Then this cracker Skywalker gets his hands on a light- saber, and the boy decides he's gonna run the fucking universe - gets a whole Klan of whites together, and they're gonna bust up Vader's hood the Death Star. Now what the fuck do you call that!</utterance>

      <utterance>Many, many silver ingots. Now, my mother's uncle being quite the ingenious chap - he buries the trunk again and heads up to the main office, where he proceeds to purchase a cemetery plot. Guess which one?</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, and here's why: my mother's uncle rode that train every day for the rest of his life. One day up, the next day back. Did that 'till the day he died. He donated the fortune he'd acquired to the train station in Pittsburgh, to have a well-lit terminal built. The train line let him ride for free after that.</utterance>

      <context>The crowd applauds. Alyssa shakes her head, smiling. Holden pokes her.</context>
      <utterance>A long time ago, we used to have this bass player who took off one day to draw funny books or something. Maybe you've seen her stuff - it's called 'Idiosyncratic Routine''</utterance>
   <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Alyssa shakes her head no. The crowd urges her. Holden pushes her forward.</context>
      <utterance>But what a lot of people don't know is that she used to harbor these delusions that she could sing. And she used to subject us to these throaty renditions of Debbie Gibson tunes and shit, insisting that we let her front on a few numbers. Well, we didn't and she quit.. and then she got famous, the bitch.  But she's here tonight, and I think if we all begged, or maybe offered her some X, she'd get up here and treat us to some of her vocal stylings.  What do you say, Alyssa?</utterance>

      <utterance>She is such a twat.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This is for that special someone our there. Holden smiles. Banky joins him. Holden glances at him. Banky offers a mocking mimic of his smile. The band starts playing. Cross cutting begins. Alyssa launches into a torchy tune. The song is extremely sexy - as is Alyssa who works the mic, making direct eye contact with... Holden. Or does she! Holden is smiling, being seduced, Banky rolls his eyes. Beside Holden, stands a pretty GIRL with a short haircut, who's also riveted by Alyssa's performance. Alyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out there. The song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at. It's more than obvious there's a seduction going on, bur of whom! At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but Alyssa's preoccupied. She points to someone in the crowd, and curls her finger back in a 'c'mere' fashion, urging whoever it is to join her. She jumps off the stage. Holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw- shucks style. At that moment, the Girl beside him leaps forward. Banky's eyes widen. Holden looks up and is suddenly taken aback. Alyssa and the Girl race into each other's arms and fall into a way-to-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss. Holden's eyes bug. Banky allows a smile to creep across his face. The crowd applauds. Banky looks around, and for the first time, we get the distinct impression that this is a lesbian bar... There are a lot of chicks in this place. Gay chicks. Banky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back.</context>
      <utterance>Alright. I should dedicate this, right?</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Alyssa and the Girl continue to kiss.</context>
      <utterance>Now that, my friend, is a..  ...shared moment Holden continues to stare - mouth agape.</utterance>

      <utterance>Sure.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So for you, to 'fuck' means to penetrate. You're used to the more traditional definition - you inside some girl you've duped, jack-hammering away, not noticing that bored look in her eyes.</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>'Fucking' is nor limited to penetration, Banky. For me it describes any sex when it's not totally about love. I don't love Kim, but I'll fuck her. I'm sure you don't love every girl you sleep with.</utterance>

      <utterance>What?! I lost my tolerance for the bullshit baggage that comes with eating girls out. What's the big deal?!</utterance>

      <utterance>If you say the smell, so help me, I'll slug you.</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not the smell - the smell is good. I'm talking about not being able to do it property. And my mother brought me up to believe that if I can't do something right I shouldn't do it at all. Of course, my father told me she gave lousy head, but that's beside the point.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>At least you blame yourself for your sexual inadequacies.</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, I blame them. Chicks never help you out. They never tell you what to do. And most of them are self- conscious about that smell factor, and so most of the time they just lay there, frozen like a deer in the headlights, right? Not for nothing, but when a chick goes down on me. I let her know where to go, and what the status is. You gotta handle it like CNN and the Weather Channel - constant updates.</utterance>

      <utterance>No, he's got a point. That's how I was in high school - I was nervous, and inhibited about being eaten out. But by the time I got to college, that all changed. I loosened up. Not only did I learn to communicate - I learned to be bossy. I was like one of those guys at the airport with those big flash lights - waving them this way, directing them that way, telling them when to stop.</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And that's all I'm saying, it'd be different if chicks helped out - pointed a guy in the right direction. Then there'd be no bullshit, no wasted time, and no chance for permanent injuries.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Permanent injuries?</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sure. You wanna see something permanent!  I got this from Nina Rollins, sophomore year. I'm going down on her, and out of nowhere, her cat jumps on her stomach. She does this big ol' pelvic thrust - cracks my tooth in half, sends it down my throat. I had to get a crown for the stub.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I got that beat.  I got that beat.  Sophomore year. I'm going down on Cynthia Slater in her dorm room after we went club-hopping. I'm totally drunk, and in the middle of it, I fall asleep - right there in her lap. She got so mad, she digs her heel into my back, right there.  That's permanent.</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You see this!  That's the farthest I can move my neck to the right Sophomore year, I'm going out with Maria Bennert, and for six months, I'm going down on her, and not a damn thing's happening. Then one night, I change a position, or vary my lapping-speed, and suddenly it's a whole new world. She's moving around, convulsing, breathing heavy. And her legs are pressing against my ears so tightly that I don't hear her father come into the room. He grabs my hair...  ...and he pulls me way back, hard.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Banky and Alyssa laugh. Holden looks at a small scar on his arm and thinks better about mentioning it. Then Kim re-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssa's neck.</context>
      <utterance>Senior year. Spring Formal. I'm eating our Missy Kurt in her brother's car. She's laying across the back seat, and I'm half-hanging out of the car, my knees on the ground. She's flailing around, and she knocks the parking brake off. The car starts rolling down the hill, and my right knee is cut up all to shit like a kiddy's scissor class cut it up for paper dolls.</utterance>

      <utterance>And rush hour starts in six hours. Let's go.  Thanks for inviting us out. It was... educational. Alyssa waves at him as he exits. Banky slides out of the booth.</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Since you like chicks, right.. do you just look at yourself in the mirror all the time? Holden reaches in and pulls Banky out. Alyssa watches them go, then turns and kisses Kim.</utterance>

      <context>1) Holden and Alyssa sit in the DINER eating. Holden's talking. The Waitress walks past and drops her pad. She bends over, to pick it up, hiking her mini-skirt up in the process. Alyssa stares at her ass. Holden stops talking and stares at her. Alyssa looks over at him and offers a caught smile. 2) Holden pushes a shopping cart at the FOOD STORE, throwing various things into the basket. Alyssa comes up with a box of Tampons and throws them in. Holden glances at them, a bit flushed. Alyssa catches him, picks up the box, and pulls one out. She proceeds to demonstrate their usage, throwing one leg on the can and miming insertion. Holden puts up his hands in the "I know, I know," fashion. 3) In the Studio, Holden displays some of his artwork to Alyssa, during which she pulls out a cigarette and goes to light it. It's a child-proof lighter, so she's having trouble. Holden grows a little frustrated. Finally, he grabs the lighter and pulls the child proof tab out with his teeth. Alyssa stares at him a bit taken aback. Holden spits the tab out, and lights Alyssa's smoke. He then continues with his display. 4) Holden and Alyssa at the COMIC BOOK STORE. Steve-Dave and the Fan-Boy eye them suspiciously. Alyssa pays for a comic. Steve-Dave glowers at Holden. He gives Alyssa her change and they exit. Steve-Dave goes back to his card game with the Fan-Boy. Suddenly, a garbage can comes crashing through their window. Steve-Dave rips a check off the garbage can and punches the counter. The Fan-Boy rubs his back soothingly, 5) Holden and Alyssa walk through a PARKING LOT, talking. She takes his hand and pulls his arm around her shoulder. Holden smiles to himself.</context>

      <utterance>The premise is very basic - you roll the ball up the ramp at varying speeds, in an effort to pop it into the score circles. The higher the score, the more prize tickets you get.</utterance>

      <context>Alyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and whips it overhand. It pops off one of the circles and shoots back at them, missing them as they duck. An OC knock and an "OW!" is heard. Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs.</context>

   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>

      <utterance>I think you're reading too much into it.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I think you're just so used to it that it rolls off your back. I've heard the two of you play your little rank out game where one insists the other is gay.  "You're a faggot. No, you're a faggot." It's cute and all to watch you go at it like grade-schooler, but it's also offensive - labeling and ducking the label of being gay as if it were the scarlet fucking letter.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're blowing this way out of proportion. We live in a more tolerant age now. You refer to yourself as a dyke. Hooper calls himself a faggot all the time...</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Holden kind of sulks. Alyssa notices.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah, but that's what's known as empowerment/disempowerment. I call myself a dyke so it's not too devastating when some throwback screams it at me as I'm leaving a bar at night. Same for Hooper - by calling himself a faggot, he steals the thunder away from the mouthy jerks of this world who'd like to beat him to it. But the difference between us having it and your friend saying it is miles wide. We say it to mask the pain - you say it for lack of a better expression at any given moment. No Holden, we do not live in a more tolerant age. And if you think that's the case, then you've been in the suburbs way too long to be resuscitated.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But you know what?  I have more faith in you than that.  Come on - I want my cheap prize.</utterance>

      <utterance>I love you. And not in a friendly way, although I think we're great friends. And not in a misplaced affection, puppy-dog way, although I'm sure that's what you'll call it. And it's not because you're unattainable. I love you. Very simple, very truly. You're the epitome of every attribute and quality I've ever looked for in another person. I know you think of me as just a friend and crossing that line is the furthest thing from an option you'd ever consider. But I can't do this any longer. I can't stand next to you without wanting to hold you. I can't look into your eyes without feeling that longing you only read about in trashy romance novels. I can't talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are. I know this will probably queer our friendship - no pun intended - but I had to say it, because I've never felt this before, and I like who I am because of it. And if bringing it to light means we can't hang out anymore, then that hurts me. But I couldn't allow another day to go by without getting it out there, regardless of the outcome, which by the look on your face is to be the inevitable shoot- down. And I'll accept that But I know some part of you is hesitating for a moment, and if there is a moment of hesitation, that means you feel something too. All I ask is that you not suppress that - at least for ten minutes - and try to dwell in it before you dismiss it. There isn't another soul on this fucking planet who's ever made me the person I am when I'm with you, and I would risk this friendship for the chance to take it to the next plateau. Because it's there between you and me. You can't deny that. And even if we never speak again after tonight, please know that I'm forever changed because of you and what you've meant to me, which - while I do appreciate it - I'd never need a painting of birds bought at a diner to remind me of.</utterance>

      <utterance>I've given that a lot of thought, you know? I mean, now that I'm being ostracized by my friends, I've had a lot of time to think about all of this. And what I've come up with is really simple: I came to this on my terms. I didn't just heed what I was taught, you know? Men and women should be together, it's the natural way - that kind of thing. I'm not with you because of what family, society, life tried to instill in me from day one. The way the world is - how seldom you meet that one person who gets you... it's so rare. My parents didn't really have it. There was no example set for me in the world of male/female relation ships. And to cut oneself off from finding that person - to immediately half your options by eliminating the possibility of finding that one person within your own gender... that just seemed stupid. So I didn't. And by leaving my options open, I was branded 'gay', which to me was no big deal - labels are labels, you know? They define what you do, not who you are, I guess. But then you come along. You - the one least likely; I mean, you were a guy.</utterance>

      <utterance>And while I was falling for you, I put a ceiling on that, because you were a guy. Until I remembered why I opened the door to women in the first place - to not limit the likelihood of finding that one person who'd compliment me so completely. And so here we are, I was thorough when I looked for you, and I feel justified lying in your arms - because I got here on my terms, and have no question that there was someplace I didn't look. And that makes all the difference.</utterance>

      <utterance>Alyssa Jones? Shit. I know Alyssa Jones. I mean, I know Alyssa Jones, you know what I'm saying? Me and Rick Derris used to hang our with her for awhile, right? Just hanging around her house after school, 'cuz her parents were like never home, and shit. And one day, Rick just whips it out, and starts rubbing it on her leg and shit; chasing her around the living room - I was dying. But you know what the crazy bitch did? She fucking drops to her knees, and just starts sucking him off right in front of me! Like I wasn't even there man! I almost died! But that's not the fucked up part - the fucked up part was Rick, man - right in the middle of it, he turns to me and he's pointing at her and he says "Cohee." Just like that - "Cohee." So I'm like I'll give it a shot. And I start pulling her pants down all slow, 'cuz I figure any second she's gonna turn around and belt me in the mouth, right? But yo, check this shit out - she's all into it man! She don't try to stop me or nothing! She's all wet and shit, and I just went to work, know what I'm saying? Me and Rick are going to town on this crazy bitch, and she's just loving it, all moaning and shit! It was fucked up! So Rick's the one that came up with the nickname - 'cuz that day, she had us locked in tight from both sides - like a pair of goddamn Chinese finger cuffs!</utterance>

      <utterance>Holden - don't even try to come off like you don't know what I'm saying. Men need to believe that they're Marco fucking Polo when it comes to sex - like they're the only ones who've ever explored new territory. And it's hard not to let them believe it. I let my boys run with it for awhile - feed them some of that "I've never done this before..." bullshit, and let 'em labor under the delusion that they rockin' my world, until I can't stand them anymore. Then I hit 'em with the truth. It's a sick game. The world would be a better place if people would just accept that there's nothing new under the sun, and everything you can do with a person has probably been done long before you got there.</utterance>

   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes Holden! In fact, everything you heard or dug up on me was probably true! Yeah, I took on two guys at once! You want to hear some gems you might not have unearthed - I took a twenty six year old guy to my senior prom, and then left halfway through to have sex with him and Gwen Turner in the back of a limo! And the girl who got caught in the shower with Miss Moffit, the gym teacher? That was me! Or how about in college, when I let Shannon Hamilton videotape us having sex - only to find out the next day that he broadcast it on the campus cable station?! They're all true - those and so many more! Didn't you know? I'm the queen of urban legend!</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Easily! Some of it I did out of stupidity, some of it I did out of what I thought was love, but - good or bad - they were my choices, and I'm not making apologies for them now - not to you or anyone! And how dare you try to lay a guilt trip on me about it - in public, no less! Who the fuck do you think you are, you judgemental prick?!</utterance>

      <utterance>I used them! You don't think I would've let it happen if I hadn't wanted it to, do you?! I was an experimental girl, for Christ's sake! Maybe you knew early on that your track was from point 'a' to 'b' - but unlike you I wasn't given a fucking map at birth, so I tried it all! That is until we - that's you and I - got together, and suddenly, I was sated. Can't you take some fucking comfort in that? You turned out to be all I was ever looking for - the missing piece in the big fucking puzzle!  Look I'm sorry I let you believe that you were the only guy I'd ever been with. I should've been more honest. But it seemed to make you feel special in a way that me telling you over and over again how incredible you are would never get across.</utterance>

      <utterance>So there's me an Amy, and we're all inseparable, right? Just big time in love. And then about four months in, I ask about the ex-boyfriend. Dumb move, I know, but you know how it is - you don't really want to know, but you just have to... stupid guy bullshit. Anyway she starts telling me all about him - how they dated for years, lived together, her mother likes me better, blah, blah, blah - and I'm okay. But then she tells me that a couple times, he brought other people to bed with them - menage a tois, I believe it's called. Now this just blows my mind. I mean, I'm not used to that sort of thing, right? I was raised Catholic.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do something.  So I get weirded out, and just start blasting her, right? This is the only way I can deal with it - by calling her a slut, and telling her that she was used - I mean, I'm out for blood I want to hurt her - because I don't know how to deal with what I'm feeling. And I'm like "What the fuck is wrong with you?" and she's telling me that it was that time, in that place, and she didn't do anything wrong, so she's not gonna apologize. So I tell her it's over, and I walk.</utterance>

      <context>Everyone's silent Silent Bob lights a cigarette.</context>
      <utterance>No, idiot. It was a mistake. I wasn't disgusted with her, I was afraid. At that moment, I felt small - like I'd lacked experience, like I'd never be on her level or never be enough for her or something. And what I didn't get was that she didn't care. She wasn't looking for that guy anymore. She was looking for me. But by the time I realized this, it was too late, you know. She'd moved on, and all I had to show for it was some foolish pride, which then gave way to regret. She was the girl, I know that now. But I pushed her away...</utterance>

   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know you're wondering why I asked you both here tonight, at the same time, knowing that we have shit to settle between us, separately.</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I just figured you wanted to kill two birds with one stone by telling her to fuck off with me here so you didn't have to go through the story again later on.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Fuck you.</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not even if you let me videotape it.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Enough!  I've been going through things, over and over. And I dissected it all, and looked at it a thousand different ways. Banky - there's friction between us for the first time in our lives. You hate me dating Alyssa and you want me to sign off on this M-TV thing.</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How perceptive.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Alyssa - you and I hit a wall, because I don't know how to deal with... your past, I guess.</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's a nice way of putting it. I'd have said the whole double-stuff thing...</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm only going to say it once: shut up.  Now - I know I'm to blame one way or the other on both accounts. With you, Alyssa - it's my fault because I feel inadequate. Because you've had so much experience, had such a big life; and my life's been pretty small in comparison.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That doesn't matter to me...</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Please. I have to get through this.  And with you Banky - I know why you're having such a hard time with Alyssa, and it's something that's been obvious forever, but I guess I just didn't acknowledge it.  You're in love with me.</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What?</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're attracted to me. Just as, in a way, I'm attracted to you. I mean, it makes sense - we've been together so long, we have so much in common...</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's something you're going to have to deal with. Bank. You may very well be gay, which explains your homophobia and why you're so jealous of Alyssa, and your sense of humor as well.</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Just 'cause a guy's got a predilection coward dick jokes...</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He grabs a chair from the side of the room.</context>
      <utterance>Bank. Stop. Deal with it. You'll feel much better.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Alyssa's face drops. She subtly shakes her head.</context>
      <utterance>Now - at this point, you may be asking yourself the question that I've been going over and over in my head for the last few days: what does one have to do with the other?</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And when I did some serious soul- searching, it came at me from out of nowhere, and suddenly it all made sense - a calm came over me. I know what we have to do. And then you - Bank, you Alyssa, and I - all of us... can finally be... alright.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Please don't say it.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The room is silent. Holden Lights a cigarette. Banky's eyes nearly bug. Alyssa's head drops.</context>
      <utterance>We've all got to have sex together.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Banky stares forward, wide-eyed. He leans back into the couch and lets out a huge sigh. Then shrugs.</context>
      <utterance>Don't you see? That would take care of everything. Alyssa - I wouldn't feel inadequate or too conservative anymore. I'll have done something on par with all the experience you've had. And it'll be with you, which'll make it that much more powerful. And Banky - you can cake that leap that everyone else but you sees that you should take. And it'll be okay, because it'll be with me - your best friend for years. We've been everything to each other but intimates. And now, we'll have been through that together too. And it won't have to be a total leap for you, because a woman will be involved. And when it's over, all that aggression you feel toward Alyssa will be gone. Because you'll have shared in something beautiful with the woman I love. It'll be cathartic. A true communion. We have to do this. For me, for both of you... for all of our sakes. This will keep us together.  What do you say?</utterance>
   <speaker>BANKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Holden smiles at his friend. Then he looks at Alyssa.</context>
      <utterance>Sure.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Alyssa looks at him, sadly.</context>
      <utterance>You know I need this. You know it'll help.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Holden reacts, shocked Banky lets out a sigh of relief.</context>
      <utterance>No.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No? I... I thought you'd be into this.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You did? What does that say about me?</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But you've... you've done... stuff... like this. This should be no big deal for you.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You don't want this.  You really don't want this. Trust me.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I need this. This has to happen. Why can't you see that? And how can you not? What does that say about me? You can take it from two guys whose names you can barely remember, but I ask you to share an experience like it - where it's about intimacy - and you say no?</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Holden moves to her side of the couch.</context>
      <utterance>I can't.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A tear rolls down her cheek She looks at him, sadly, and touches his face.</context>
      <utterance>You can. I'll be there. And when it's over, we'll be the strongest we've ever been because we got through some nasty shit together. And we'll finally be on the same level together. And then there'll be nothing we can't accomplish.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh Holden.  That time is over for me. I've been there. I've done it. And I didn't find what I was looking for in any of it. I found that in you - in us. Doing this won't help you forget about the things you're hung up on. It'll create more.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No it won't. I thought about all of that.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She releases him, then slaps him.</context>
      <utterance>No, it will. Maybe you'll see me differently from then on - maybe you'll despise me for going along with it, once you're in the moment. Maybe I'll moan differently and then you'll resent Banky, and become suspicious of us. Or you'll alienate him because of it, and then grow to blame and hate me for the deterioration of your friendship. Or what if- I sincerely doubt it, but what if - I saw something in Banky that I never saw before, and fell in love with him and left you. I've been down roads like this before; many times. I know you feel doing this will broaden your horizons and give you experience. But I've had those experiences on my own. I can't accompany you on your's. I'm past that now.  Or maybe I just love you too much. And I feel hurt and let down that you'd want to share me with anyone. Because I never wanted to share you  Regardless I can't be a part of this.  Or you. Not anymore  I love you. I always will. Know that.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Alyssa storms away, stopping briefly to look Banky up and down.</context>
      <utterance>But I'm not your fucking whore.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She walks our of the studio. The door closes behind her. Banky and Holden stand there, silently. Cut to black.</context>
      <utterance>He's your's again.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Banky locks eyes with someone OC. His expression softens. Holden leans against a wall on the far side of the room. He smiles at Banky. Banky smiles back, and sort of nods. Holden holds up a copy of Banky's new solo comic. He points to it and gives a thumbs up.</context>
      <utterance>No. Not really.</utterance>
   <speaker>OC FAN</speaker>

      <context>Banky looks in another direction, OC. He looks at Holden and points to it. Holden looks in the same direction, and then looks back at Banky and nods.</context>
      <utterance>Guess not. Some doors just shouldn't be opened.</utterance>
   <speaker>OC FAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Banky looks at Holden for a beat. Then he brings his pointer fingers together, mimicing Holden's 'shared moment' gesture. Holden shrugs slightly, then crosses his fingers - as if to say 'hopefully'.</context>
      <utterance>You don't need that guy, anyway. You do great stuff without him.</utterance>
   <speaker>OC FAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Banky sort of smiles at the OC Holden. Then he offers his own thumbs up - as to say 'good luck'.</context>

      <context>A comic book drops on the table in front of her. It's a comic book called 'Chasing Amy'. She leafs through it, not looking up.</context>

   <speaker>HOLDEN</speaker>

      <utterance>A month ago. I did a really small run. Self-financed. Only about five hundred issues.</utterance>

      <context>He walks away. A few steps away, he turns and waves again. She waves back. And then he starts moving through the thrall of fan-boys. The Woman returns with coffee. She follows Alyssa's gaze.</context>
      <utterance>Really nice to see you too.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>who was that?</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She watches him go for another beat, then.</context>
      <utterance>Hmm! Oh. Just some guy I knew.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And as they fall into conversation, the show goes on.</context>
      <utterance>Next  So what do you want to do tonight?</utterance>
