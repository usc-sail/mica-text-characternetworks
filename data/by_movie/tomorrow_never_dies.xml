   <speaker>TANNER'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Watching this display is M, TANNER, and a handful of MILITARY BRASS, including a RUSSIAN GENERAL, BUKHARIN, and BRITISH ADMIRAL ROEBUCK, an aging sea-lion with no love for M, or MI-6. M deals with the humorless Admiral by, well, humoring him:</context>
      <utterance>Roger, Seven.</utterance>
   <speaker>M</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'</utterance>
   <speaker>ADMIRAL ROEBUCK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.</utterance>
   <speaker>M</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin?  The general chuckles. Translates:</utterance>
   <speaker>GENERAL BUKHARIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>'In a joint operation, someone's nose always gets put out of joint.' M turns to Admiral Roebuck:</utterance>
   <speaker>M</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Tanner points to the video wall with a RED LASER PEN.</context>
      <utterance>I'm interested in success, Admiral. Not who gets credit.  Mr. Tanner: What have we got?</utterance>
   <speaker>TANNER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>A regular terrorist swap meet. Death at discount: Two Chinese Long March Scuds, a pair of Soviet A-17 attack helicopters -</utterance>

      <utterance>Stolen -</utterance>
   <speaker>TANNER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And the crates look like American M-16 assault rifles, Chilean antipersonnel mines, six French Exocet missiles, and 75 - no maybe a hundred - kilograms of Czech made C-4 Semtech explosive.  Something for everyone. Fun for the whole family.</utterance>

   <speaker>COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>To sum up: After analyzing the tire inflation of the fork-lift in the MI-6 video tape, NATO believes the "red box contains approximately eighty kilograms of U235 weapons grade uranium - an incredibly hard, incredibly heavy, incredibly lethal substance.</utterance>
   <speaker>M</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And that's enough enriched uranium to produce how many nuclear devices?</utterance>

   <speaker>COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Kim Dae Yung. Moscow-trained North Korean nuclear weapons specialist; apparently fell out of favor with the current North Korean regime after a botched attempt to steal fissionable material from a British light-water reactor in South Africa - an accident that left him entirely hairless... Another face appears on the screen: COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART  And Rendera Sikrahm, also known as Richard Stamper. Freelance mercenary, Laos and Cambodia. His father was from Nepal - a Ghurka warrior - con- scripted by the British government to fight in China during World War II - after which the family settled in Hong Kong, where the young Stamper was undoubtedly treated like a second class citizen by both the Hong Kong Chinese, and local British.  We've all read about the signs at the British swimming pools in Hong Kong that said "No Ghurka's allowed."</utterance>
   <speaker>BOND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nothing like a little imperialism to promote loyalty among the faithful.</utterance>
   <speaker>COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>In conclusion: Both these men have a vendetta against the world. They are nuclear armed, and dangerous. And having failed to get the UZ35 through the old opium route - the Khyber Pass - it's NATO's belief that their next attempt will be through Bulgaria - where the NATO Nuclear Strike Force will be there to stop them.</utterance>

   <speaker>BOND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.</utterance>
   <speaker>M</speaker>

      <context>Bond looks at Johnstone quizzically. Then a very tight-lipped M. He senses he's about to enter a minefield:</context>

   <speaker>M</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It seems, 007, we've received a tip</utterance>
   <speaker>MINISTER JOHNSTONE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A rumor - from an anonymous source -</utterance>
   <speaker>M</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>- that Sir Elliot may be involved with Stamper and Yung, and the missing Uranium.</utterance>
   <speaker>MINISTER JOHNSTONE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hearsay. Idle chatter from a source you can't identify - who insists on talking only to 007. Nothing but loose talk and innuendo.</utterance>
   <speaker>M</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>(M has punched a button, and Valentin's video bio has appeared.)</context>
      <utterance>That may be the case at present, Minister Johnstone... But our own sources suspect that Mr. Harmsway used his considerable Russian media - holdings to elect Valentin Zukofsky President of the Ukraine - in trade for the uranium.</utterance>
   <speaker>MINISTER JOHNSTONE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.</utterance>
   <speaker>MINISTER JOHNSTONE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?</utterance>
   <speaker>M</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Johnstone is reeling. M continues, to Bond, with aplomb:</context>
      <utterance>... No more than I need remind you, Minister, that merely being a member of the lucky sperm club - does not preclude one from a life of criminal activity.</utterance>
   <speaker>M</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Of course.</utterance>
   <speaker>M</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>BOND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?</utterance>
   <speaker>M</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes. 1988. He was furious at the British plan to return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the Chinese Government. The inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a rather powerful enemy -</utterance>
   <speaker>MINISTER JOHNSTONE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not to mention the chaos it caused at Whitehall when his newspapers began screaming for the recall of the sitting government.</utterance>

      <utterance>I'm sending you to Venice, 007. You're to check out the source, determine whether Elliot Harmsway is involved with the enriched uranium, and, if so, stop him.</utterance>

      <utterance>There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.</utterance>

Then we turn him over to you, and the English government puts him on a military transport back to London. Bond nods, looks over at the Sea Dolphin II. DiGIACOMO Do not worry, my friend. I only want what is best. For both of us. Bond stands to leave. DiGiacomo smiles after 007 - as if he's</utterance>

      <utterance>...And so, it's somewhat fitting that we are here today... To christen this environmental research boat in Venice - - 'Venezia' - the port where Marco Polo sailed forth to explore the world's great uncharted oceans...  That 2/3 of the earth's surface where the sharks are not working members of the press.</utterance>

      <context>He motions to Zukofsky, who nods to the audience...</context>

   <speaker>HARMSWAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nervous chuckles around the table, but the General is reserved. HARMSWAY (cont'd) Yet to sell this building for more money - to profiteer - would run counter to the Chinese sprit of guanchi - mutual trust and obligation; it would violate the ancient principles of feng shui - (beat) - the reason we sign five documents instead of an unlucky four, and why this building has a fifth, non-functioning ventilation shaft on its roof. (beat) Wind and water, fire and rain, earth and sky - feng shui. All things - at one, in balance, with nature.</context>
      <utterance>General Li: My young associate here has just informed me that if I waited a year, I could perhaps receive a higher price for this building.  He has great faith in Hong Kong. As did my ancestors. With obvious results.</utterance>

   <speaker>SIDNEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She exits. Turning his back on Taro, Bond watches her cross the room. Taro places a huge hand on Bond's shoulder -</context>
      <utterance>Let's not make it a habit.</utterance>
   <speaker>TARO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I think you should go -</utterance>
   <speaker>BOND</speaker>

      <context>And from BOND'S POV - Sidney greets HARMSWAY with a big hug.</context>
      <utterance>Not quite yet, Taro -</utterance>
   <speaker>SIDNEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Watching this, Bond seethes with memory of Paris and his hatred of Harmsway. Taro tightens his grip -</context>

   <speaker>TARO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But before he finishes, Bond spins, and: 1) slams Taro's head on the bar, 2) snatches the ice-pick from the bartender, 3) yanks Taro back- ward by his collar, 4) slams the ice-pick through Taro's tie into the wooden bar, and 5) kicks the stool out from under the goon. Taro is now hanging by his tie, from the bar, choking. Bond takes a moment to straighten his own bow-tie. Wade appears, jubilant, with a wad of cash:</context>

   <speaker>HARMSWAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He thrusts an issue of TOMORROW at Bond, holding the top half out as Bond reads THE HEADLINES, sourly:</context>
      <utterance>Smash through it!  Laugh all you'd like, Mr. Bond - but you fit perfectly in to my plans.  Here. This just in. Newsflash. Read all about it.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Harmsway smiles at Bond:</context>
      <utterance>... Hong Kong destroyed by nuclear meltdown... British agent found in reactor suspected of sabotage; Harmsway calls for British government to resign.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARMSWAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>What about the gold?</utterance>
   <speaker>YUNG</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stamper and the guard appear nervous, itching to leave -</context>
      <utterance>You must go. Now. Otherwise the boat won't be out of range -</utterance>
   <speaker>HARMSWAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He turns the paper over and reads/reveals a smaller headline:</context>
      <utterance>Thirty seconds.  That's the most brilliant part of the plan, Mr. Bond: To save the economy, I'll let the new British government - my British government - announce that the gold was irradiated in Hong Kong - where no one will be able to touch it for a hundred years.  And just by coincidence:</utterance>
   <speaker>HARMSWAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stamper moves towards Bond and Sidney. Bond edges closer to the gun.</context>
      <utterance>...Gold mine opens in Vietnam.  Let's go. Put them in the airlock.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bond tenses, ready to spring -</context>
      <utterance>You'll never get away with it, Harmsway. Too many people know.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARMSWAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bond moves, but - the guard picks up the gun!!! Bond frowns.</context>
      <utterance>Who, Mr. Bond? The kooks - the crazies - the conspiracy theorists? The Oliver Stones of the world?  I'll publish their books, I'll make their movies, I'll put them on my TV shows!  They're my bellboys. They carry my luggage.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARMSWAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Fortunately, Bond has a back-up plan. As Stamper hustles them off -</context>
      <utterance>Now. Get them in the airlock.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Harmsway considers this for a second. Sidney takes Bond's arm.</context>
      <utterance>One problem, Harmsway: The girl. And the handcuffs. They'll give it away.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIDNEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bond looks at her. He's surprised: In the blink of an eye, he realizes he's developed feelings for her. He knows that if he could hold her, he'd kiss her, and whisper "You're a hell of a girl"... But at the same instant - throwing a glance at Yung - he knows he's running out of time against the worm, and is better off alone.</context>
      <utterance>No. I want to stay with him.</utterance>

      <utterance>Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs.</utterance>

      <context>As Stamper pushes Bond into the reactor room airlock, he hears:</context>
