      <context>Behind the station, at the top of the hill, lies the St. Cloud's orphanage.</context>

      <context>The couple enters the orphanage, where we hear the sound of babies.</context>
      <utterance>Here in St. Cloud's, I have come to understand that promises are rarely kept, that the battle isn't so much against evil as ignorance, and that being successful can't hold a candle to being of use .</utterance>

      <context>Dr. Larch hands over the infant to the adopting parents.</context>

      <context>A tiny hand comes in with a stethoscope and puts it on the big belly.

There are shadows on the black screen. Suddenly the movie "King Kong" appears.</context>
