      <context>He turns back to face an as-yet-unseen audience.</context>
      <utterance>Written like this. One word. Small e. Capital X, capital Z.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEVI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We now see Levi's audience, about seventy-five people, some standing, some sitting on plastic folding chairs. They are of very mixed age and type, but they all cheer and applaud enthusiastically. We are in the central playing area of a small, deconsecrated country church, and Levi performs on a broad, low, carpeted plywood dais. At the far end of the dais, a man and a woman - assistants to Levi - are carefully laying out about two dozen plastic modules that look somewhat like high-tech ski boots.</context>
      <utterance>eXistenZ. It's new, it's from Antenna Research, and it's here, right now.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEVI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A delighted stir from the crowd.</context>
      <utterance>My name is Wittold Levi, my friends call me Witt - and I'm the project manager for eXistenZ. I recognize some familiar faces - that's all right, that's all right. We won't throw you out. We encourage consumer loyalty, and we want you to help us with our product testing. We're a team, Antenna and you.</utterance>

   <speaker>LEVI</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>An unbelieving, excited stir. Could it really be?</context>
      <utterance>tonight, it won't be me. No, for the test launch of eXistenZ by Antenna, we have brought you a seminar leader who is rather special.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEVI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The small crowd is now tremendously excited, wide-eyed, murmuring, one or two have actually gotten on their knees.</context>
      <utterance>Yes, it is. The world's greatest game designer is here, in person, to lead you, the first test enclave, through her newest creation, eXistenZ by Antenna...</utterance>
   <speaker>LEVI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Levi moves to the edge of the crowd, works his way into it until he has reached a small, unobtrusive figure who up to now has hardly been noticed. She stands next to a security guard who is dressed in a suit and tie but carries an electronic wand of some sort. His name-tag identifies him as Ted Pikul (rhymes with "Michael", not with "pickle"), and we will see more of him later. As Levi takes her hand and gently leads her out of the crowd, her fans applaud softly, touch her hem. They part like water as she passes amongst them, clutching her own personal game-pod case with both hands. She mounts the dais like a blind person led by her seeing-eye dog. Allegra Geller, early thirties, conservatively dressed, is bright, acutely aware, but wary and controlled. When she speaks, she is deliciously, sexily shy, serious, melodic.</context>
      <utterance>I give you, the Game-Pod Goddess herself - Allegra Geller!</utterance>

      <utterance>The world of games is in a kind of a trance. People are programmed to accept so little, but the possibilities are so great.</utterance>
   <speaker>GELLER</speaker>
      <mode>PAUSE</mode>
      <context>Excited murmurings from the crowd.</context>
      <utterance>You probably thought that tonight, we were going to test a new game that I designed.</utterance>
   <speaker>GELLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Confused, slightly disappointed mutterings.</context>
      <utterance>But there is no new game to test, at least, not in the usual sense.</utterance>
   <speaker>GELLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The crowd's spirit rises again. Levi steps forward, smiling, playing off the renewed energy.</context>
      <utterance>No, no, it's going to be much better than you expected, because eXistenZ is not just a game. It's an entirely new game system. Antenna Research and I developed it together - the eXistenZ System by Antenna - and it involves a whole lot of new toys, which you are going to be the first to try out.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEVI</speaker>

      <context>With a theatrical flourish, Levi whirls around to face his two assistants, who have finished laying out their devices on the back table and are now standing crisply at attention at either end of it.</context>
      <utterance>But I never had anything quite so fun or so revolutionary to teach as what Allegra and I are going to teach you all tonight.</utterance>

      <context>In response, the fan thrusts a card at him. Pikul takes the card, a complex invitation card which includes a holographic photo of the fan under which floats his name, Joel Dichter.

      <context>Dichter has scanned OK. Pikul waves him into the church to join the spectators who will form the second wave and re- locks the door. On the dais, in the center of the circle of linked game players, Levi nods at Geller.</context>

   <speaker>GELLER</speaker>
      <mode>PUMPED</mode>
      <context>There is giddy laughter in the room. Geller looks at every player-in the circle as Levi steps down off the platform and retires to the far edge of the small, watching throng.</context>
      <utterance>Sure. This is my favourite part.</utterance>
   <speaker>GELLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Now the giddy laughter goes a touch nervous, uncertain, but it's too late. Geller depresses a nipple-like protuberance on the game-pod on her lap, and all the players close their eyes and go rigid, like members of a seance who have suddenly been contacted by the spirit world. The pods in their laps begin a rhythmic, peristaltic rippling. At the edge of the crowd, Pikul sidles up to Levi.</context>
      <utterance>I'm ready to download eXistenZ by Antenna Research into you all now. I'm warning you, it's going to be a wild ride, but don't panic no matter what happens. I'll see you all back here in no time at all.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>And we're worried that it's too intellectual, too complex, too weird, too artsy. That argument ; never bothers her until she faces her fans. She hates to be rejected in the flesh, so we make her come out sometimes to take the heat.</utterance>
   <speaker>PIKUL</speaker>
      <mode>ADMIRINGLY</mode>
      <context>A strange, choral humming begins to fill the church. Pikul and Levi turn their attention to the dais, where the fans rock and sway with the pulsing of the pods in their laps.</context>

      <mode>LAUGHS</mode>
      <context>Haltingly, but gamely, Pikul tries to hum along.</context>
      <utterance>It's the new Antenna Research theme song. We thought this would be a good way to launch it. Everybody who plays eXistenZ is going to be very familiar with that tune.</utterance>
   <speaker>PIKUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Levi helps him out, and soon the whole room is humming along happily, warmed by the Antenna Research corporate theme song. The whole room, that is, except for Joel Dichter, who, at the edge of the dais, is more concerned with fumbling around in the vinyl pod-case hanging from his shoulder. In the case, we watch as Dichter tears open his obsolete game-pod to reveal a bizarre weapon, a pistol made of bone and gristle, almost like the half-decayed body of a small mammal - whose snout is the barrel, whose rigid hind leg is the trigger. Dichter takes his weapon out of its case, shakes off a few gelatinous strips of game-pod flesh, and steps up onto the dais. Pikul is the first to notice this. He glances at Levi, who's still blissed out and humming, then launches himself awkwardly through the crowd. Now in the middle of the circle, Dichter makes his way towards the blissfully unsuspecting Geller, raising his weapon as he goes.</context>

   <speaker>PIKUL</speaker>
      <mode>TO DICHTER</mode>
      <context>Dichter turns to see Pikul stumbling through the small crowd, scrambling onto the dais. Distracted, Dichter hurriedly raises his weapon again and fires it at Geller. The first shot hits her in the shoulder and spins her off her chair, which collapses over her and takes the second bullet on its seat rim. The circle of players on the dais moans as one, swoons and jostles: they are all feeling the neural surge of Geller's traumatized nervous system. Peeking out from under her folding chair, Geller's eyes are wide with fear and confusion. She clutches her shoulder without being aware of it. Blood seeps in between her fingers Now Levi and his two assistants scramble onto the platform to get at Dichter, who fires wildly, hitting two of the players nearest Geller. The circle of players immediately goes spastic, screaming and twitching and dropping to the ground and writhing. Many of them are clutching their shoulders in the same spot as Geller, sympathy pain transmitting through their UmbyCords. Pikul manages to tackle Dichter, then starts whacking at him with the security wand. Dichter twists around and raises his weapon at Pikul, who immediately backs off in terror. But before Dichter can pull the trigger, the two assistants produce small, normal pistols from hidden holsters and empty their clips into the prostrate Dichter. Dichter manages to squeeze off one last shot at the approaching Jevi, hitting him squarely in the chest. Levi goes down and is lost amongst the jostling feet. The watching fans pile onto the dais and begin to help the players unplug from the game-pods which are obviously causing them distress. Three of the players attack the dying Dichter, dragging their game-pods after them, kicking at whatever part of him they can find in the confused mass of bodies. in the turmoil, Pikul is knocked to the ground. Amid the stamping, sliding feet, he finds himself lying across the stricken-Levi. Levi clutches Pikul desperately.</context>

Pikul looks down at his own hands, which seem to,know what to do: place glue on the boards, glue them down to a resin frame using a template, insert needle-like electrodes into the bodies of certain epoxied insects. The insect boards, Pikul notes, are actually whole insects coated in epoxy and frozen together like a sick collage. At least, here in the game they are. Pikul is now automatically doing flashy moves with the odd materials in front of him with great dexterity. Nourish takes note of this.</context>

A moment of eery silence, and then Pikul and Geller peek wide-eyed over the-edge of the bed. Flames now engulf the nearby chalet, all too clearly visible throught the shattered window frames.
