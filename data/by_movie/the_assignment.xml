      <context>He looks out through the shutters at the digital clock across the square. Then he glances back at the girl whom we will call COLETTE. The conversation is in French with English subtitles.</context>

      <context>Carlos crosses to her slowly. He runs his hand across her cheek, then down across her throat. Death is in his eyes.</context>

      <context>He mimes flicking a match and Jack looks for a match. He's out. He offers the lit end of his cigarette. Carlos cups Jack's hand.</context>
      <utterance>Pardon monsieur...</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLOS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He crosses away from Jack, smiling and goes inside the cafe. Jack follows him absentmindedly, tracking his progress through the windows, though his view is obscured somewhat by reflections of the street. Carlos steps casually to the railing overlooking the tables inside as Jack sees the double image of Carlos and the reflected street scene. Carlos leans over, pulls the pin from an M26 grenade, and lets the "spoon" come off in his hand. We HEAR the timing fuse hiss as Carlos nonchalantly counts to himself.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>He wants to make sure everyone knows it's him. He wants the credit and the Austrians want a positive ID. That's when your name came up.</utterance>

      <utterance>Who brought my name up?</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKENA</speaker>

      <utterance>At the airport. Tomorrow. When they provide the plane to fly him and the hostages to Libya. Carlos evidently feels very comfortable in Libya.</utterance>

      <utterance>Then let me take him out! They want me to meet him at the airport. I can get close enough to get a clear shot at him. We can end this shit now.</utterance>

      <utterance>Jack! He's got seventy hostages.</utterance>

      <utterance>We will handle it with no loss of life. Those aren't just any hostages.

      <utterance>Jack goddamnit, there isn't any team to assemble! You're a fuckin' dinosaur. We're out of the assassination business. All of us! You got a personal hard on against this guy because he made you look like an asshole and now he's gonna rub your nose in it. I can appreciate your feelings, but it's not going down on our soil. It is not with our nationals and it is not our fight! Now I got my orders and you just got yours.</utterance>

   <speaker>CARLOS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His eye catching Jack, he stops in mid-sentence. A devilish smile crosses his lips as he turns towards him. He pulls a cigarette out and crosses right over to Jack, up close and as they say, very personal. The snowflakes whirl surrealistically around them as the two stand face to face.</context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry this had to happen in Austria. We have no quarrel with your government.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLOS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He mimes flicking a match. He takes off his glasses and looks at Jack and smiles.</context>
      <utterance>Pardon monsieur...</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLOS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>With a cunning, mocking smile he extends his hand out to shake Jack's. Jack stares at him, ever so slowly beginning to raise his hand. With that move he knows the gun will come slapping into his palm and he will be able to take Carlos out no matter what the cost.</context>
      <utterance>We were never really properly introduced Mister Shaw. My name is Carlos.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His hand starts rising. In another second the gun will spring into it. Just then we hear:</context>
      <utterance>Eat shit and die slow.</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKENA</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>Jack turns to look at Mickens. Mickens indicates the photographers.</context>
      <utterance>Jack, no!</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKENA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jack is momentarily confused. He has turned to Mickens thinking perhaps he was calling out a warning and now the moment for the shot has passed. He turns back to Carlos who shrugs and steps over to the Austrian minister so that the Minister now is between Jack and Carlos and the shot is lost.</context>
      <utterance>You don't want your picture taken shaking his hand.</utterance>

      <utterance>Look, obviously there has been some kind of mistake. I don't know who you think I am, but I am a Lieutenant Commander in the United States Navy, okay? I am Lieutenant Commander Annibal Ramirez of the U.S.S. Yorktown, Sixth Fleet, docked in Haifa. I am not Carlos or Sanchez or Illich or the Jackal or whoever you think you just caught. If you call the U.S. Embassy and ask for the Sixth Fleet Liaison Officer, he'll confirm everything I've said.</utterance>
   <speaker>AMOS</speaker>

      <context>Carlos, who from now on out will be referred to by his real name, RAMIREZ, has had it with the reasoned approach. He now adopts the demeanor of a U.S. Naval Officer reaming an enlisted man a brand new bunghole.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Per instructions... An American officer on shore leave in the Middle East must travel in mufti, civilian clothes. A bunch of Arabs start chasing me... could be terrorism... could be kidnapping... instructions are to ditch our tags, our ID or anything else that could identify us. That's why I spoke Spanish, that's why I said I was a Cuban, not an American. And you broke my ribs here asshole. I'm gonna sue you, I'm gonna sue your government... I'm gonna sue every fuckin' Jew I can get my hands on you, understand me?!</utterance>

      <utterance>Lieutenant Commander, the governments of most countries in the free world have been after Carlos for ten years and we have nothing to show for it. There is exactly one person in the world who can help us get Carlos. And that person is you.</utterance>

   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All I can tell you is it may take as much as six months to a year of preparation. It will involve a high degree of risk. That much said, you may never as much as lay eyes on him yourself. But if we succeed Carlos won't be a threat to anyone anymore. Now I know you're going to need some time to think about it so...</utterance>

Next and maybe most important... Carlos himself. The French DST came to arrest him once. He was at his apartment, drunk, playing his guitar. He actually had them convinced it was all a mistake. Then he went into his bathroom, took a shave mind you so he would look his best for the interrogation and when he came out managed to shoot each of them through the forehead. Then he got the informer who had betrayed him, put him down on his knees and killed him... Think of it. He took a shave and didn't even nick himself once.</utterance>

      <context>Jack quickly moves away from Ramirez. As Ramirez moves, he notices that the snow mobile changes direction as well, and continues to home in on him. And then there is a second snow mobile. And then a third, all of them coming straight for him. He starts to run. The snow mobiles turn and continue bearing down on him, driving him closer toward the railing. We SEE the snow mobiles are controlled by radio antennas, evidently homing in on his transmitter. Jack, who has moved quite a ways off, pulls out a Beretta and sets it on the rail. We SEE on the snow mobiles, a lit- up remote device.</context>

      <context>Ramirez stands like a deer in the headlights for an instant and then goes running for the gun. He cannot make it to the gun before the first snow mobile barrels down upon him. He is right against the rail now and goes diving into the snow. The snow mobile goes directly over him and crashes through the rail, falling down to the field below. Ramirez is up and running, grabs the gun, fires two rounds and misses, then hits three dummy rounds which click away as the second snow mobile draws closer. Then he fires and hits a headlight, then fires and misses, then fires and hits the remote device. That snow mobile stops in its tracks. The third now barrels down on Ramirez. He clicks off two dummy rounds and just before the snow mobile hits him, a shot rings out. The receiver shatters and we SEE Jack standing with the smoking gun with which he has just saved Ramirez's life.</context>

Walk through the house... through the living room and the kitchen only. You have thirty seconds. Walk casually through the house so as not to make her suspicious of anything you do and find out if she's telling you the truth or not. If you pass this test your questions will be answered.

      <utterance>You know why you don't fuck around on your wife? Not because you don't want to. You're a man. You want to fuck everything. But you don't... because you're afraid it would cost you what... your wife, your family, your self respect maybe...</utterance>

      <utterance>...You know what Carlos would do if he was married? He'd bring whatever woman he wanted home and make his wife fuck her. That's what no rules means. That's what you're too much of a pussy to get.</utterance>

      <utterance>The thing about Carlos is... he doesn't lose himself with a woman... not with a lover... maybe with a whore I don't know... I wasn't his whore. Lovers are different to him... he might have a use for them... so he has to seduce them properly. He has to make sure they're so crazy about him they'll do anything for him.</utterance>

   <speaker>CARLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She rocks herself back and forth, comforting herself and now for the first time we see the bottle of Irish whiskey she holds at her side. She raises it, takes a long gulp, some of the fluid dripping down the corner or her mouth. She doesn't bother to wipe it away. It is there next to tearstains on her cheeks. Slowly, her rocking back and forth, her primal comforting, the act of an abused and abandoned child will turn into strokes, caresses of a secret style from a phantom lover who will get her in the mood for what she must do. She must get herself wet. She must get herself ready. She must recapture what it is to be seduced by Carlos. Her hand is her lover now.</context>
      <utterance>Shhh! You're not here.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLA</speaker>

      <utterance>You don't exist until I'm ready to let you exist, and then... you do exactly what I say.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She masturbates herself stopping just short of climax. Then she looks up at Ramirez, acknowledges his presence and lets him exist.</context>
      <utterance>It's not pleasure for him... it's... it's... it's... this sick kind of conquest... you know this seduction... he's got to make you not just a lover but a disciple... a worshipper... He brainwashes you with his body... so... so... you'll do anything... you see because he's the perfect lover... he does it all to... not to please you... but to excite you... to... to make it dangerous for you and then, that's very sexy too, to a woman... that danger... like he could kill you in a second... but instead he makes you come... So he's almost killed you, you see? And you have this orgasm right then and it's like he's killed you and there isn't anything left of you and he makes you be born again the way he wants you to be. So there isn't a thought in your brain that he hasn't put there. Not a feeling in your body that he hasn't put there.</utterance>

      <context>In the far distance, we are vaguely aware of a huge truck barreling along, coming straight down the highway towards them.</context>
      <utterance>But now you love me and we're going to run away to San Francisco and find a reformed rabbi to perform a mixed gay marriage. Listen to me... You're going to feel more alone than you've ever felt in your life. It will hit you all of a sudden and you'll think your heart's going to jump out of your chest, you'll think everyone around you can hear your heart beating, and that everyone around you is an enemy agent. I want you to be prepared for that. So you can deal with it. Understand?</utterance>

      <context>Suddenly it seems, the truck is right on top of them, heading straight for them, like monster in a child's nightmare. It passes within inches and Ramirez has to fight to keep from jumping as the truck roars past them. It is not a monster, just a truck. Then again, it could have killed them just the same.</context>
      <utterance>We had an agent... the best we ever had in training. We were going to infiltrate him into Beirut and then use him to penetrate the PFLP. No student ever scored higher than this man... We set up his cover for six months in Argentina. He was perfect. And then we sent him to Beirut. He got off the plane, went to his hotel, went up to his room and had a nervous breakdown.</utterance>

      <utterance>We had to mount an operation to send in a man posing as a doctor so we could drug him and get him out on a plane. Okay? Now you understand? Nothing prepares you. I want you to know that so when it hits you, you don't panic, you feel the fear and then get rid of it.</utterance>

Frank starts to drop but before he can, Ramirez grabs his ears and brings his head down into his own swiftly rising knee. The result is devastating and Frank's nose is now all across his face. Blood is everywhere and Ramirez does it again. Now the object is Frank's teeth, so that when his head comes off of Ramirez's knee, his mouth is a mass of blood as well. In slow motion, Ramirez turns and sees his son who stares in horror at what his father has just done. At the same time, maura is up and grabbing onto Ramirez. Ramirez however is not done. Frank is completely defenseless now and Ramirez leans him back across his knee, pulls him by the hair exposing his throat like that of a sacrificial lamb about to be slaughtered. This time instead of a knife, it will be a karate chop from Ramirez which will crush Frank's windpipe and kill him. But before he can deliver the blow, Maura grabs his arm. He turns to her, almost about to hit her or throw her off and the two of them are face to face as Ramirez looks from her to his son and realizes how deep into the abyss he has plunged.</context>
