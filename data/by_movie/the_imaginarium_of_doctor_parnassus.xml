   <speaker>ANTON/MERCURY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>PERCY does a roll on the drum as a curtain behind ANTON/MERCURY rises to reveal DOCTOR PARNASSUS - he appears to be an Indian holy man - long scraggly beard, chalk white make up, a large red circle on his bald head, a crown of yellow flowers, strings of beads, and partially covered in a loose-fitting swath of white cloth - apparently levitating several feet above the stage. (He's sitting on a glass plinth). DOCTOR PARNASSUS is seemingly in a trance. A bronze tripod containing burning incense stands beside him.</context>
      <utterance>Ladies and Gentlemen... Step up! Step up!... I, Mercury, the messenger of the gods, invite you... tonight, for one night only... at this very venue... to enter the mind, the very great mind, of Doctor Parnassus!</utterance>
   <speaker>ANTON/MERCURY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>A young woman, VALENTINA,(wearing a wig of long blonde hair and a white, flowing costume which gives her prominent hips and breasts) stands facing an elaborately framed full-length mirror nestled upstage amongst cut-out trees representing a forest... This is `Beauty'. She turns and steps forward. ANTON takes her hand. They make a couple of dance steps together. They look enchanting and enchanted.</context>
      <utterance>Doctor Parnassus... as old as time... yes, ladies and gentlemen, more than a thousand years old ... he has the power to empower your mind. A secret learned in the mystic East. Let Doctor Parnassus open your imagination. Let him guide and transport you to worlds and possibilities you never dreamt of... If you dare. But... Beware... there are dangers. You will have to choose. Will your soul fly?... Or will it be dashed on the rocks of darkness? The choice is yours and yours alone. Transcend the heights on Beauty's wing.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANTON/MERCURY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Now PERCY, in demon costume, leaps from behind the scenery .</context>

      <context>MARTIN has begun, with difficulty, to clamber onto the stage. His MATES laugh and shout encouragement.</context>

   <speaker>ANTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ANTON tries to prevent MARTIN from getting on stage. But MARTIN thumps ANTON and pulls him into the `audience'. MARTIN'S drunken MATES laugh and applaud. MARTIN is now on stage and heading for DOCTOR PARNASSUS who is still in a trance. PERCY tries to head him off but MARTIN shoves PERCY off the stage. PERCY lands on the ground with a crash. More laughter from the MOB.</context>
      <utterance>No. Sorry. That's n-not allowed. You have to t-take a t-ticket first.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>MARTIN lunges at `Beauty' who retreats up stage. MARTIN blunders into the scenery as he pursues `Beauty' who stays just out of reach. She takes cover behind a cut-out tree. ANTON and PERCY climb back onto the stage as MARTIN continues to chase `Beauty'. VALENTINA evades him by ducking through the mirror (made of flexible reflective material slit down the middle). MARTIN crashes after her. ANTON and PERCY exchange worried looks. They look at DOCTOR PARNASSUS. Should they wake him from his trance? They decide not to but it's a difficult decision.</context>

   <speaker>MARTIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>VALENTINA stops, turns, smiles sweetly and slams her fist hard into MARTIN'S gut. He doubles up. VALENTINA pauses for a moment, contemplating doing some serious damage, before striding off. MARTIN staggers to his feet.</context>
      <utterance>Come here you little sexpot!</utterance>
   <speaker>MARTIN</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He rushes after her but, trips on a root (a real 3 dimensional tree root) and pitches face first to the ground. Recovering, he looks up. Shock. He is surrounded by a dark, terrible, and very REAL forest. `Beauty' has vanished.</context>

   <speaker>MARTIN</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>again!. Honest!... From now on... I swear!.. Not a drop! With a smile of satisfaction, the HAND CREATURE stops jabbering and let's go of MARTIN'S collar. Down he plummets. The ground rushes up. MATRTIN is as good as dead. But when he hits the ground, rather than going SPLAT!!, he bounces high in the air, turns a couple somersaults and lands on his feet. He can't believe what has just happened... and then he hears music. Beautiful, ethereal music. In the distance a light is glowing. It's the sun, rising above a majestic mountain pass. Cut into the rock, is a long stairway winding up to the summit. The HAND CREATURE swings down, gives MARTIN the "thumbs up", and points encouragingly toward the stairway. Reformed and determined, MARTIN heads for the stairs. But on reaching them he discovers that each one is 6 feet high. The stairway is ridiculously steep and difficult. Letters are carved into the first stair..."THE 12X12 STEP PROGRAM...GOOD LUCK". This is going to be tough. The sound of a honky-tonk piano makes him turn. Behind him the sky is dark. A roadside bar/nightclub with flashing neon lights has appeared. He hesitates. He could use a drink before the long climb. He heads for the club. The door to the club is opened by a mechanical fairground figure of a jolly smiling man (MR NICK) distinguished by a bowler hat and a red waistcoat.</context>
      <utterance>Please... I'll never...! Never</utterance>

ANTON, irritated, glances back at DOCTOR PARNASSUS who is worried about the lack of customers. TONY is now surrounded by fascinated WOMEN. They laugh at one of his jokes.

      <utterance>There are hard choices to be made in life.  What about the dreams of the less fortunate in the world. Do you have time for their dreams? Or are you like I once was...do you just despair? Despair at all that is wrong in the world..  ...despair at your inability to do anything to change it.. to make it better...I despaired so much at the powerlessness of my own existence that I took the easy way out...the coward's way...I committed suicide! Yes, that's right, I killed myself. Can you understand my despair? But I was saved...saved by a miracle...The Imaginarium...and Doctor Parnassus. He brought me back from the dead. He gave me a new life. A reason to live. He has given me power to dream again... to dream of a better world.</utterance>

      <context>In the distance, TONY is hiding behind some billowing fabric. On being spotted, he takes off up a hill. The RUSSIANS race toward the hill only to crash into a solid wall - painted as a landscape with TONY frozen in mid stride. Looking off to their right they see Tony heading up another hill. But as they rush in that direction another wall rises up blocking them. Again it is painted with a hill and TONY frozen in midstride. A third and fourth wall rise up.. surrounding and trapping the RUSSIANS. There is a cell door in one wall. Like crazy animals they start throwing themselves against the door trying to break it down. It won't budge. While the others batter the door, GREGOR, who has been somewhat affected by the soft shampoo commercial world, sits quietly in a corner picking pretty flowers. Exhausted, the other RUSSIANS collapse on the ground. GREGOR gently breathes in the aroma of the flowers and exhales. As he does the door swings open. The other RUSSIANS gape at him... then barrel out the door. Outside is a new, beautiful, landscape - the sky dotted with white fluffy clouds. Extending from the ground to each cloud is an incredibly long ladder. On each ladder is a person climbing upwards. The RUSSIANS spot Tony. He is already a hundred feet up a ladder and climbing. Unfortunately, their way is blocked by an over-bright, hyper- active, wide-eyed sales girl.</context>

TONY struggles to pull out the metal pipe he keeps on a string around his neck. He gets it to his mouth as if to swallow it when... ... the ground erupts and a giant London policeman's helmet rises up (we are talking 20 feet tall)and revolves - revealing DR. PARNASSUS' carved and painted face beneath. The mouth drops open and a great red tongue rolls out like a welcoming red carpet. From inside the giant mouth a smiling policeman beckons the RUSSIANS to come on in.. The terrified RUSSIANS let go of the lynching rope. TONY drops to the ground and, with a whistle, the brass pipe flies out of his mouth. Behind the RUSSIANS a painted backdrop unfurls..it reads "JOIN THE FUZZ.. WE LOVE VIOLENCE".. and a chorus line of LONG-LEGGED GIRLS in mini-skirted police outfits appear - high-kicking a snappy song and dance number. The astonished RUSSIANS don't know what the fuck is going on. Suddenly, a friendly OLD WOMAN'S VOICE is heard shouting something in Russian. Spinning around, the RUSSIANS see an old BABOUSHKA (Russian grandmother) outside a tumble-down cottage waving gaily to them. A stunned pause. Then, pell-mell, they rush to her.</context>
