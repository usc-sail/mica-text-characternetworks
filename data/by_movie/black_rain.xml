   <speaker>DEBUTANTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She throws her chips on the pot. Nick hesitates, then decides to match it.</context>

   <speaker>DEBUTANTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>That draws a laugh from her friends. The entourage heads for the bar. CHARLIE SKLOARIS, twenty-three, steps in front of the debutante, blocking her path. She steps to the side. Charlie steps with her. Charlie's pushing it, he's always pushing it. She's not amused. Finally, Charlie lets her pass. He comes up to Nick.</context>
      <utterance>Looks like you have a lot of experience in places like this. It was nice of them to relax the dress code for you.</utterance>
