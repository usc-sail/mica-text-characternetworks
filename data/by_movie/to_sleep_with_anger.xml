      <utterance>My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.</utterance>

I loves it more than preaching. Now ain't that a sin, lord. So all the preachers went on confessing, each one worst than the last. Finally they came to the last preacher who had been very quiet and listening to every word that fell. One of the preachers said to him, it's your turn. Confessing will lift you burden, Brother. Bare us your soul. We did. The last preacher said, no, my sin is the worst among all of you. One of the preachers said, ah go on man and stop all this suspense. So the last preacher said, like I told you my sin is the lowest.  My sin is gossiping and I can't wait to get out and tell what I heard. Sunny does not get the humor of the story.

Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.</utterance>

   <speaker>BABE BROTHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.</utterance>

      <context>The SOUND of Rodney's trumpet is heard but is no longer irritating.</context>
      <utterance>It feels like a storm has passed... Hattie read some of Harry's letters to a woman he had a child by. The child had died and he was writing to give her some comfort. Hattie didn't know that deep down at the bottom of Harry's hate, there was some love.</utterance>

      <context>Suzie doesn't pay any attention; she is involved with her potted plant. Gideon looks over at the Preacher, who is still asleep.</context>
      <utterance>Did I ever tell you the story about the man who wanted to make his own mind up about heaven and hell? He didn't want nobody's opinion but his own.</utterance>
   <speaker>GIDEON</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...</utterance>

      <context>The RATTLING of pots and dishes starts suddenly. Harry's body starts to sway gently as if he were about to get up. Everyone is frozen. Babe Brother and Linda remain asleep. The rocking caused by the earthquake doesn't wake them. M.C., Herman, Okra and Hattie and Marsh enters the dining room. Harry's feet are seen in the kitchen still swaying.</context>
      <utterance>It's only a tale.</utterance>
