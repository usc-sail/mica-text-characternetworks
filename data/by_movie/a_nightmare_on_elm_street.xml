      <context>TINA'S MOTHER sticks her head in with a worried look. TINA sits up and blows out a breath, groggy.</context>
      <utterance>You okay, Tina?</utterance>
   <speaker>TINA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The woman, once attractive, ventures a step into the room. A MAN hovers BACKGROUND. TINA'S mother waves him away without looking, shoving a strand of bleached hair from her eyes. She appraises her daughter.</context>
      <utterance>Just a dream, Ma...  Damn dream, is all...</utterance>
   <speaker>TINA'S MOTHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>TINA looks down at her nightgown, only now aware of the chill penetrating it from the room. There are four long slashes up its middle, cleanly cut as if by scalpels.</context>
      <utterance>Some dream, judging from that. She nods at TINA's nightshift.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>The woman shuts the door behind her. TINA looks back to her nightgown.</context>
      <utterance>Hold your horses.  You gotta cut your nails or stop that kind of dreaming, Tina. One or the other.</utterance>
   <speaker>TINA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She suddenly snatches up the cross that hangs over her head, her face white as her sheet.</context>

   <speaker>ROPE JUMPERS</speaker>

      <context>7. MOVING ANGLE FAVORING NANCY. She's a pretty girl in a letter 7. sweater, with an easy, athletic stride and the look of a natural leader. GLEN, holding her hand, wears one of the school's football jerseys; a good-natured, bright kid. Tina's in mid-conversation.</context>
      <utterance>Seven eight, gonna stay up late! Nine ten -- never sleep again!</utterance>
   <speaker>TINA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nancy nods.</context>
      <utterance>That's what it reminded me of -- that old jump rope song.  Worst nightmare I ever had. You wouldn't believe it.</utterance>
   <speaker>NANCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>TINA turns to NANCY, but before either can say more, ROD LANE, a lean, Richard Gere sort in black leather and New Wave studs joins up with them and interupts.</context>
      <utterance>Matter of fact I had a bad dream last night myself...</utterance>
   <speaker>ROD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Tina cracks her gum with a look of withering indifference.</context>
      <utterance>Had a hardon this morning when I woke up, Tina. Had your name written all over it.</utterance>
   <speaker>TINA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The guy's stopped in his tracks.</context>
      <utterance>There's four letters in my name, Rod. How could there be room on your joint for four letters?</utterance>
   <speaker>ROD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He cuts off across the lawn.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn mower!</utterance>

   <speaker>TINA</speaker>
      <mode>CONTD</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?</utterance>

   <speaker>TINA</speaker>
      <mode>CONTD</mode>
      <context>BELLS ARE RINGING, and STUDENTS crowding; TINA and NANCY are drawn into the crush.</context>

   <speaker>NANCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>GLEN shoves a cassette into TINA's Ghetto Blaster.</context>
      <utterance>Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...</utterance>
   <speaker>GLEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>See, I got this cousin who lives near the airport, that it's okay for me to stay with, right? So I found this sound effects tape at Licorice Pizza, and... The phone is answered. GLEN jerks the tone arm off the record with a SCRUUPT!!</utterance>
   <speaker>GLEN</speaker>
      <mode>CONTD</mode>
      <context>A JET PLANE begins to make itself heard on the tape. GLEN moves the machine closer to the phone. It's a big plane -- sounds like a 747 coming in for a landing.</context>
      <utterance>Hello, Mom?  Yeah, out here at Barry's.</utterance>
   <speaker>GLEN</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>The Jet is SCREAMING IN now, full flaps and howling like a monstrous banshee. NANCY and TINA dissolve into muffled giggles.</context>
      <utterance>Huh? Yeah, noisy as usual. Glad we don't live here -- huh? Yeah, Aunt Eunice says hello.</utterance>
   <speaker>GLEN</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>Suddenly the tape goes silent. GLEN blanches. Next moment another ENGINE is heard, but this one is a FORD LOTUS screaming by at 180 mph.</context>
      <utterance>Right, right -- I'll call you in the morning! Right! Huh? Yeah, sure, I, huh?...</utterance>
   <speaker>GLEN</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>The sound effect changes abruptly to a SPEEDING SEDAN -- and the ages-old SCREECH of BRAKES, last-second SCREAM and horrible COLLISION. NANCY gamely tries to find the right button to turn it off, but misses. There's a loud SCREEK of fast-forward mayhem -- Glen improvises desperately.</context>
      <utterance>Uh... some kid's drag racing outside, I think...</utterance>
   <speaker>GLEN</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>NANCY jumps back from the cassette player -- WORLD WAR II bursts out at top volume -- MACHINE GUNS, HAND GRENADES, DIVING BEARCATS and SHOUTS of charging Huns. GLEN makes a last-ditch dive and flings the cassette out of the machine. Blessed silence at last.</context>
      <utterance>Listen, Mom, I got to go -- I think there's been an accident out front -- I --</utterance>
   <speaker>GLEN</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>He hangs up and sags back.</context>
      <utterance>Right. I'll call the police. No, just some neighbors having a fight, I guess. I'm fine, I'm fine! Call you in the morning!</utterance>
   <speaker>NANCY</speaker>

      <utterance>Worked like a charm.</utterance>
   <speaker>GLEN</speaker>

      <utterance>Nice to have a fire.</utterance>
   <speaker>TINA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>NANCY turns a nearby valve handle, and the gas fire climbs brightly over its artificial log. TINA joins her, heartened.</context>

   <speaker>NANCY</speaker>

      <utterance>He should join the Marines, they could make something out of him. Like a hand grenade. TINA laughs despite herself. NANCY brightens.</utterance>

      <context>TINA shakes her head, wishing she had forgotten.</context>
      <utterance>See? You've forgotten the bad dream. Didn't I tell you?</utterance>
   <speaker>TINA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>NANCY looks up with a flinch.</context>
      <utterance>All day long I been seeing that guy's weird face, and hearing those fingernails...</utterance>
   <speaker>NANCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>TINA looks up.</context>
      <utterance>Fingernails?  That's amazing, you saying that. It made me remember the dream I had last night.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>What you dream?</utterance>
   <speaker>NANCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The story has left the room deathly quiet. Especially TINA seems effected.</context>
      <utterance>I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of ...obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...</utterance>
   <speaker>TINA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>NANCY remembers, imitating the frightful coincidence.</context>
      <utterance>So what about the fingernails?</utterance>
   <speaker>NANCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He scraped his fingernails along things -- actually, they were more like fingerknives or something, like he'd made them himself? Anyway, they made this horrible nose --</utterance>
   <speaker>GLEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They look at him. He looks away, as if suddenly listening.</context>
      <utterance>That's impossible.</utterance>
   <speaker>TINA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What?</utterance>

<dialogue id="5" n_utterances="14">
   <speaker>GLEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>No answer but a slight RUSTLE in the bushes. GLEN does a 180 and walks right back inside. The girls prod him right back out, giddy with giggling fear.</context>
      <utterance>I'm gonna punch out your ugly lights, whoever you are.</utterance>
   <speaker>GLEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's just a stupid cat.</utterance>
   <speaker>NANCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The girls push him farther. GLEN edges towards the shadows. Then the SCRITCHING again. GLEN stops; TINA edges back into the house.</context>
      <utterance>Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.</utterance>
   <speaker>TINA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ANGLE INTO THE SHADOWS. Turned from the girls, GLEN sobers, listening. IN HIS POV we see the street. Silent houses. Motionless trees on empty lawns.</context>
      <utterance>Anyway, I don't have a cat...</utterance>
   <speaker>GLEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Not a living, or dead, soul. GLEN turns back to the girls with a shrug. Instantly, a large FIGURE pounces and throws him to the ground with a shout. The girls SCREAM in panic and run for the house. 11. REVERSE -- ROD leaps up and shouts like a sportscaster -- 11.</context>
      <utterance>Kitty-kitty? Chow chow chow?</utterance>
   <speaker>ROD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ROD dances into the light, flashing a wild gypsy's grin at TINA. The girl's relieved and frightened at the same time.</context>
      <utterance>And it's number thirty-six, Rod Lane, bringing Lantz down just three yards from the goal with a brilliant tackle! And the fans go wild!</utterance>

      <context>ROD takes the spindly hand rake he's found and scraps the house's wall. It makes a terrible SCRIIITCHING SOUND. He grins and tosses it aside.</context>

   <speaker>ROD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

      <context>ROD wheels, a knife suddenly in his hand, as if ready to take Glen's throat out. NANCY breaks between --</context>
      <utterance>Maybe a funeral, you dickhead.</utterance>
   <speaker>NANCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ROD eyes GLEN, laughs and flips the knife closed and away, putting his arm around TINA's shoulder and laughing as if it's all a great joke.</context>
      <utterance>-- Just a sleep-over date, Rod. Just Tina and me. Glen was just leaving.</utterance>

And on his fingers are the steel talons. 29. CLOSE ON HIM as he takes the blade on the end of his right index 29. finger and lopes off one of the fingers of his left hand. Then another.

BACK ON NANCY, sitting upright, wiping the sleep from her eyes, 46. shaking her head like a punchy prozefighter. She looks back out the door. 47. REVERSE IN 'NORMAL' POV -- the hallway is empty. But there's a 47. dark smear on its floor tiles. 48. NANCY looks nervously towards the rest of the class. No one else 48. has noticed a thing outside the door.

She slides closer to the surface of the water, letting its heat sooth her nerves. Her eyes stare straight up, glazed; her breathing deepens. REVERSE, across to her legs, crooked, one knee on each side of the tub. There's a ripple in the water between. Then something tiny and shiny breaks the surface between them. It pops up with a slithering MUSIC CUE and catches a sliver of light. Then it begins to rise. Higher and higher it rises, soon accompanied by another, then two more shining, gleaming blades, and then the full glove and dark hairy hand and then the wrist and arm, straight up light an evil sapling between the girl's knees, the knives bloosoming into a bright flower of razor sharp steel in the air, moving over the girl's belly.

      <context>191. Behind her the DOOR SPLINTERS. NANCY whirls around just in time 191. to see KRUEGER bull in! NANCY's eyes go wide -- she's trapped against the bars and has nowhere to go. The man bunches his knives into a single thick blade and rushes her, stabbing. NANCY closes her eyes -- Then from OUT OF FRAME Marge leaps between the two.</context>
      <utterance>You heard what I said! Now get back inside or I'll tell your dad!</utterance>
   <speaker>MARGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She blocks the charge perfectly -- blocking the knives. Both she and NANCY are slammed backwards against the bars behind. Drunk though she is, is hanging onto KRUEGER'S weapon hand, keeping the knives inside herself, away from her daughter!</context>
      <utterance>No!</utterance>
   <speaker>MARGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But NANCY turns to the window instead, screaming for her father.</context>

      <context>Behind her the huge MAN is thumping down the stairs, KNOCKING THINGS OVER, SCRAPING his LONG STEEL FINGERNAILS along the wall with a horrible sound! NANCY flings a heavy ash tray through the porch window and screams through the bars.</context>
      <utterance>Come on -- he's in here! Daddy! Don't let him kill me too!</utterance>
   <speaker>NANCY</speaker>
      <mode>CONTD</mode>
      <context>KRUEGER, bloody and spewwing threats, staggers for her -- NANCY dives behind the couch. CLOSE ON KRUEGER'S FEET as they hit another wire. CLOSE ON the Lifesaver jerking out -- the clothespin snapping together, completing the circuit with a CRACKLING SPARK. WIDER ON THE EXPLOSION that rips out of the floor lamp next to KRUEGER and knocks him sprawling across the room. NANCY peeks out from behind the couch. The man lies in a smoking heap. NANCY runs to the windows and screams out again.</context>

   <speaker>NANCY</speaker>
      <mode>CONTD</mode>
      <context>KRUEGER roars up behind her -- she throws herself sideways -- he crashes into the window frame, smashing glass and wood to bits. NANCY turns SCREAMING and runs deeper into the house.</context>

      <context>The man shoves out his hand to LT THOMPSON. THOMPSON stares at it without touching it. A long, thin steel blade, razor sharp, attached to some sort of ring and armature -- broken off... The CORONER gives a sweaty, grim smile.</context>

Within moments they've destroyed the door and LT THOMPSON has pulled his daughter into the safety of his arms. But NANCY immediately fights free and darts right back to the front door -- beckoning him to follow -- gesturing like a wild woman.</context>

      <context>210. WIDER ON NANCY as she walks to the curb. The whole scene is 210. wrapped in an unseasonal tule fog, bright yet diffuse. We notice that NANCY's house no longer has bars on its windows. Then we see a familiar convertible pull up at the curb, top down. TINA and ROD are in the back seat.

      <context>ANGLE INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE. GLEN slips into the seat next to NANCY. Someone else is driving, it seems. NANCY looks up to the DRIVER. The big MAN turns and grins at NANCY, a terrible, scarred, hideous leer of a grin -- FRED KRUEGER'S grin! ANGLE BACK OUTSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE as its top clamps over the kids within -- a bright red and yellow top that closes as fast and hard as a beartrap! NANCY'S frightened face flies to the window, pressing against the thick glass as the car roars away from the curb and into the thick fog. 211. CAMERA PANS TO a group of LITTLE GIRLS, half-hidden by the fog, 211. jumping rope and singing gayly.</context>
