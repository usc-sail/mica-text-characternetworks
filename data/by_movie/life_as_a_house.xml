      <utterance>Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?</utterance>

      <utterance>There are no windows facing my...exposure.</utterance>

      <context>Colleen shies away from George's stare; he finally turns and walks toward the house but stops short as he turns back.</context>
      <utterance>My life is a warning. I just can't figure out for what.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>This stops Colleen for a moment; it was difficult. George walks back to the cottage and locks Guster in before stepping into an old Ford truck and driving off. Colleen watches him drive off, then turns to her house and stares.</context>
      <utterance>Colleen, how hard was it for you to get your head outside that window far enough to see my dick?</utterance>

      <utterance>Dad said it first.</utterance>

      <utterance>I get chocolate cake for your birthday.</utterance>

      <utterance>Dude, nice look.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sam drops his cigarette and stomps it out as he stands; his face lightens as Alyssa waves before walking away.</context>

      <context>Josh raises his eyebrows and smiles before walking away. Sam faces the Saab and kicks the bumper as hard as he can. Suddenly, a boy (COREY) bolts up from the back seat.</context>
      <utterance>Two hours a week for three-hundred cash. The whole summer. Do the math.  They consider that a hatchback or a station wagon? Oh, that isn't yours anyway, is it?</utterance>

      <utterance>Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>George is totally confused, unsure most of the answer, but before he can question her, a police car pulls to a stop; OFFICER KURT WALKER steps out.</context>
      <utterance>Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys. I hate nose rings. And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.</utterance>
   <speaker>KURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Officer Walker removes a pad from his pocket and flips through to find his place.</context>
      <utterance>Thought I'd run over the list.</utterance>

      <utterance>From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today. Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn. The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.</utterance>

      <utterance>You forgot David Dokos and Tom and Barbara.</utterance>
   <speaker>KURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>George hands him the plane and Kurt begins to work the wood.</context>
      <utterance>Mr. Dokos calls animal control for Guster and I was out here on the other.  Do you mind?</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Are you guys' friends?</utterance>
   <speaker>KURT</speaker>

   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends? Listen to music? Masturbate together? Talk on the phone? George doesn't answer and Kurt keeps working.</utterance>

      <context>Alyssa stares at George, disappointed.</context>

   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I aimed high.</utterance>
   <speaker>KURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I wouldn't want you as a friend.</utterance>
   <speaker>KURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Kurt is beginning to perspire as he shaves food off the beam for Guster.</context>
      <utterance>George just never really...aimed that high. Even with not hitting a rabbit. I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun. It was always like you were frightened. Quiet and boring.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALYSSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.</utterance>
   <speaker>KURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He builds models for architects. His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal. Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.</utterance>
   <speaker>KURT</speaker>

      <utterance>Left you this place.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.</utterance>
   <speaker>KURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it! I can't afford dirt in this town. I live in Riverside, Goddammitt And you get to piss in the ocean. Kurt stops working and steps back.</utterance>

      <utterance>Thanks for telling me.</utterance>
   <speaker>KURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Kurt walks to his car and drives off. There's a moment of awkwardness with Alyssa. George walks into his house leaving Alyssa with Guster.</context>

      <utterance>Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects. It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.</utterance>

      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Bryan is rattled by George's blank stare. He takes his glass of orange juice and sits back in his chair, taking a sip, all the while keeping an eye on George.</context>
      <utterance>Listen, they decided on a week a year severance, but I got them to twenty-six. That's six months salary, George. Medical and everything for six months. You can learn all you need to on the computer long before that. Maybe find a job closer to home.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bryan knows he's supposed to say something, he just can't seem to figure out what.</context>
      <utterance>My wife left me because I wasn't...very emotional. I kept trying to explain that my father sucked all the emotion from me. Drunks do that, sometimes. Make their kids afraid. Make them unwilling to express themselves.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRYAN</speaker>

      <context>Bryan lights up at the sound of his Alma matter.</context>
      <utterance>We were probably in school together. You went to Berkley?</utterance>
   <speaker>BRYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Class of eighty-six! I didn't know you were there.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This is not the direction Bryan had hoped the conversation was headed.</context>
      <utterance>I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Bryan wants this to end. He leans forward with a whisper.</context>
      <utterance>My dad had a blood alcohol level of .18. A little high. Drove right into oncoming traffic. Killed my mother with him. A lady in another car. Hurt her daughter. A five-year old girl. I think about her still.</utterance>

      <utterance>From the day I started...to today. Can't stand it. Bryan is perplexed as George stands.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It may sound that way, but I react out of fear. My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like. You haven't been listening, have you?</utterance>
   <speaker>BRYAN</speaker>

   <speaker>BRYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I feel better about this now.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Relieved and not understanding anything about irony, Bryan stands and extends his hand. George shakes Bryan's hand without malice.</context>
      <utterance>Good. I was hoping for that.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I've got one favor to ask.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What can I do for you, George?</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bryan recoils slightly from the request.</context>
      <utterance>I built my first model here when I was twenty. There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office. Twenty years of my life. I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home? Only the ones that really mean something to me.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work. I could maybe ask them if you could choose one. But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours. They're a part of this firm. They inspire me. I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed. It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, it's the least I can do.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>George nods and leaves. Bryan looks lost and guilty again.</context>
      <utterance>Yes, it is.</utterance>

   <speaker>STEVEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>George stops for a second to focus on Steven, but Steven is smart enough to run. George continues on with the business of disassembling his work.</context>
      <utterance>Mother of God! Not my house!</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The plea is instantly followed by a pathetic low whine. George works up a sweat as he whacks model after model; portions of plastic walls or window splatter the office as though bombed in war. Bryan Burke's secretary inches as close as she dares.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, please, please, no!</utterance>
   <speaker>SECRETARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>George lowers his stick as he faces her.</context>

   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>With that, George finishes what he began only minutes prior: the complete and utter destruction of every model displayed on every shelf in the office, save one. Workers huddle together, collectively moaning and moving en mass from the mayhem. George picks up the sole surviving model in his arms and cradles it carefully as he walks into Bryan Burke's office.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>George closes the door behind him. Bryan stares down at the remains of the model; he gets down on his knees and carefully gathers up the pieces.</context>

      <utterance>The game was to make me smaller than he was. No matter what. He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller. So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football. If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough. If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho. I never won the game. Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...</utterance>

      <utterance>You know that great thing, though? Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one. It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away. Make you something different in an instant. It happened to me.</utterance>

      <context>Robin's body moves slightly to the music as she smiles. George grins. The boys aren't sure what to make of the advice. 'You are the beautiful love (my lover), I am the distant shore (so far away). There is so much to uncover (love's hiding). What is this distance for? What is it for?</context>

      <context>Robin waits to see how worse. George finally walks to her and takes her in his arms. He must have been better than this. The waltz smooths out as they dance closer, holding tighter. "We fill the air with silent stares. But still, no one there, we are strangers." Alyssa decides it's time to go.</context>

      <context>She rests the side of her head against his chest. He kisses her hair. Outside, a hammer beats a reminder that they're not alone. The ocean drowns the sound long enough for Robin to kiss George's chin; and in that instant, the instant where everything but the touch washes away, George kisses Robin with such punch that it knocks them onto the bed. They continue to forget everything as they roll with the punch.</context>
      <utterance>I couldn't walk in there.  So he left.</utterance>

      <context>George is too quick with his hug. Josh is stiff as a board. Sam looks pissed as he walks away from the second story window and resumes screwing the floorboards. George sets his eyes on Dale as he opens his arms wide.</context>

With her kids looking on, George stands still, hesitant to comfort her. There's a moment where all that there is, where the only thing seen or heard is Robin's pain. After an awkward amount of time, she wipes her eyes, wipes her nose, crosses around the table to Sam and kisses the top of his head, then his cheek. Without a word, she walks to her car and climbs in; Ryan and Adam quickly join her in the car.</context>
