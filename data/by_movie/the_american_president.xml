      <utterance>The 10:15 is American Fisheries?</utterance>
   <speaker>JANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, sir. They're giving you a 200-pound halibut.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JANIE starts to make a note.</context>
      <utterance>Janie, make a note. We need to schedule more events where somebody gives me a really big fish.</utterance>
   <speaker>JANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, sir.</utterance>

      <utterance>Janie, I was kidding.</utterance>
   <speaker>JANIE</speaker>

      <utterance>Hey, Cooper.</utterance>
   <speaker>AGENT COOPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>SHEPHERD and JANIE enter the elevator. As the doors close...</context>
      <utterance>'Morning, Mr. President.</utterance>
   <speaker>JANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mr. Rothschild asked to have a moment with you this morning.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is he upset about the speech last night?</utterance>
   <speaker>JANIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He seemed concerned.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The elevator doors open, revealing LEWIS ROTHSCHILD. At 32, LEWIS is the President's chief domestic policy advisor. It would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night, though that doesn't seem to slow him down.</context>
      <utterance>Well, it wouldn't be a Monday morning unless Lewis was concerned about something I did Sunday night.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You skipped the whole paragraph.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>LEWIS falls into the pace as the three of them head for the double doors leading to the South Lawn.</context>
      <utterance>And Monday morning it is.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>"American can no longer afford to pretend that they live in a great society"...and then nothing. You dumped the whole handguns paragraph.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>This is a time for prudence, Lewis.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The three of them are now OUTSIDE and making their way down the COVERED WALKWAY that runs from the East Wing to the West Wing.</context>
      <utterance>That was the kick-ass section.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I thought what with being the President and all...</utterance>
   <speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sir, of course I didn't mean to imply--</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I thought you'd be turning cartwheels this morning, Lewis -- 63 percent job approval.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They walk past a GROUNDKEEPER who's at work at a patch of grass.</context>
      <utterance>That's great news, sir, but...</utterance>
   <speaker>GROUNDKEEPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Before he's even completed the last syllable of the greeting, JANIE quickly and quietly said--</context>

   <speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sir, the press is gonna need an explanation.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>

      <utterance>Because you dropped the whole kick-ass section, now we've got this thing hanging out there.</utterance>

      <utterance>And it's hanging out there?</utterance>

      <context>SHEPHERD stops at an open doorway, calls to a STAFFER--</context>

      <utterance>Did they tell you I'm gonna need--</utterance>
   <speaker>STAFFER</speaker>
      <mode>MARIA</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>--overall consumer spending and not just first homes. Yes, sir. We'll have it for you in 15 minutes.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>SHEPHERD moves on. LEWIS and JANIE stay with him.</context>
      <utterance>Thanks.</utterance>

      <utterance>Mr. President, I really feel we need to focus on...</utterance>

      <utterance>Lewis, however much coffee you drink in the morning, I want you to reduce it by half.</utterance>

      <utterance>I don't drink coffee.</utterance>

   <speaker>MRS. CHAPIL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Fine, thank you, sir. Mr. Kodak left the detailed breakdown of the approval poll for you. He seemed to indicate that it was very good news.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And by now they're in the OVAL OFFICE itself. SHEPHERD has gone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight briefing memos that have been left for him. As someone used to doing six things at once, he has no trouble reading, listening, and talking at the same time.</context>
      <utterance>Sixty-three percent of it, at any rate.</utterance>

   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I didn't truly appreciate it until I came back and discovered that America isn't a great society.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He dumped a whole section.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now there's a thing hanging out there.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not a great society, sir?</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, with you out of the country, it wasn't, Robin. Now that you're back, we're great again.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>There's a press room full of people saying "What did he mean by that?"</utterance>
   <speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>See?</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This is said to A. J. MACINERNEY as he walks through a separate entrance on the left side of the room. In addition to being the President's Chief of Staff and closest advisor, he's the President's closest and oldest friend.</context>
      <utterance>A.J., did you get one of these?</utterance>
   <speaker>A.J.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is that the letter from Solomon at the GDC?</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>These people are outta control.</context>
      <utterance>It would appear to be a letter from the entire environmental community.</utterance>
   <speaker>A.J.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I think they're just frustrated, Mr. President.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Are they blaming the President for global warming?</utterance>
   <speaker>A.J.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, they don't think he caused it, if that's what you mean.  Sir, I'm on the phone with these people twice a week. I honestly don't know what they want at this point.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What they want is a 20 percent reduction in fossil fuel emissions.</utterance>
   <speaker>A.J.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It won't pass at 20 percent.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We haven't really tried.</utterance>
   <speaker>A.J.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane hold too many markers. If we try to push this through and lose, there will be a very loud thud when we hit the ground, and that's not what you want in an election year.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Talk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them the President resents the implication that he's turned his back on the environment. Tell them I'll send 455 to the floor. But we're gonna ask for a 10 percent reduction. If they want to pull their support, fine. At 63 percent job approval rating. I don't need their help getting a bill passed. We gotta get going-- where's Leon?</utterance>

      <utterance>Aaagh!</utterance>
   <speaker>KODAK</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sorry! Sorry, my fault.</utterance>
   <speaker>A.J.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>LEON KODAK comes into the oval office. The White House pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along with A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the President's Starting Team. The people in this room have grown very close over the past few years.</context>
      <utterance>Never mind.</utterance>
   <speaker>KODAK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Excuse me. Good morning, Mr. President.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You all right?</utterance>
   <speaker>KODAK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They keep moving that big ficus plant.</utterance>
   <speaker>A.J.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We're all here, Mr. President.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Okay. First, I wanted to say congratulations. Three years ago, we were elected to the White House by one of the narrowest margins in history, and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of registered voters think we're doing a good job.</utterance>
   <speaker>KODAK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Everyone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles...</context>
      <utterance>Wait a second. You wanted me to poll registered voters?</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But the poll also tells us what we already knew: We don't get this crime bill of ours through Congress and these numbers are gonna be a memory. So, starting today, we're shifting it into gear.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Can I tell my morning press gaggle that gun control--</utterance>
   <speaker>A.J.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Crime control, Robin. Gun control means we're wimps and we're soft on crime.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hang on, are we not--</utterance>

   <speaker>A.J.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We're leaving 'em out.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sir, we campaigned on this issue. Now, I understand we took it out when we were in the low forties, but we can push it through now.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>After the elections.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sir, we may never have an opportunity like this again. Let's take this 63 percent out for a spin and see what it can do.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We can't take it out for a spin, Lewis. We need it to get re-elected. For reasons passing understanding, people do not relate guns to gun-related crime.</utterance>
   <speaker>A.J.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Robin, you can brief the press this afternoon. As of today, the crime bill's priority one on the President's domestic agenda.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROBIN</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Got it.</utterance>

      <utterance>Scare the shit out of 'em?</utterance>

      <utterance>Lewis, we want you to be legislative liaison on this. You're gonna run the show on the hill.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>SHEPHERD responds a little too quickly -- we see a spark of a temper.</context>
      <utterance>Can I just say, to return to the subject for one moment, that it might be easier to fight a war on drugs if we weren't arming drug dealers.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>

      <utterance>Lewis, we've gotta fight the fights we can win.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>We want to announce the crime bill at the State of the Union, which is 72 days from today. The last nose count put us 18 votes short.</utterance>

Leon Kodak is as good as it gets when it comes to electoral strategy, and I'm certain he's told the President exactly what I'd tell him: Nail down Michigan and California, where they make cars and airplanes -- and burn plenty of fossil fuel. But if I had read these eight hundred pages, I would have discovered that it's the burning of fossil fuels that's been mostly responsible for global warming and that the 20 percent reduction recommended by the GDC is a necessary first step toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse effect that has gone unchecked by this administration...</utterance>

      <utterance>I'm afraid Sydney's right. Although not about Michigan and California. The President has asked me to convey to you that he's sending his energy bill to the floor with a call for a reduction of 10 percent.</utterance>

      <utterance>--the President has critically misjudged reality. If he honestly thinks that the environmental community is going to whistle a happy tune while rallying support around this pitifully lame mockery of environmental leadership just because he's a nice guy and he's done better than his predecessors, then your boss is the Chief Executive of Fantasyland.</utterance>

      <context>--SHEPHERD walks into the hall as the Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays HAIL TO THE CHIEF. The 180 GUESTS come to their feet and applaud long and loud. The GROUP following the President catches up to the spot where SYDNEY has stopped walking. They all join in the applause. We can see in SYDNEY's face that she's been quite swept up.</context>

   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Okay. You're attracted to me, but the idea of physical intimacy is uncomfortable because you only know me as the President. It's not always gonna be that way, and the reason I know that is because there was a moment last night when you were with me and not the President, and I know what a big step that was for you. So, Sydney, I'm in no rush. Here's my plan: We're gonna slow down. When you're comfortable, that's when it'll happen. SYDNEY comes back into the room...she's wearing one of SHEPHERD's dress shirts and nothing else. She walks toward him.</utterance>

      <context>SHEPHERD is silent...totally blown away...he had absolutely no idea... He stands up slowly and moves toward her...LUCY doesn't know what's coming...</context>
      <utterance>Yes. Okay. Yes. Sometimes, I mean, I'm not sure. You know a lot more than I do -- but still, I have these feelings, and I don't think they're wrong. Like, okay, for instance, I'm not so sure it's all right to burn a flag. I mean, it really bothers a lot of people, and I don't know why you think it's okay. I hear Senator Rumson talk, and some of the things he says sounds right to me, and I think, "God, am I like Bob Rumson?! I mean, Dad thinks he's a jerk. Dad hates this guy! Why am I agreeing with him" And then I think, "Well, maybe I'm not really like Bob Rumson, but maybe I'm not like Dad either." But the point is I'm the President's kid, and people pay attention to what I say, and if I say something different from what you say, it'll be embarrassing for you. So I can't just get up in social studies class and say whatever I want.</utterance>

   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>

      <utterance>One more thing. I don't dislike Senator Rumson because of his political views. And even if you voted for everything he would vote for, that wouldn't make you like him. There's a fundamental difference between you and the Bob Rumsons of the world.</utterance>

      <utterance>For the record: Yes, I am a card- carrying member of the A.C.L.U. But the more important question is why aren't you, Bob? This is an organization whose sole purpose is to defend the Bill of Rights, so it naturally begs the questions.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why would a senator, his party's most powerful spokesman and a candidate for president, choose to reject upholding the Constitution? If you can answer that question, then, folks, you're smarter than I am, because I didn't understand it until a couple of minutes ago. Everybody knows American isn't easy. America is advanced citizenship.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's gonna put up a fight. It's gonna say, "You want free speech? Let's see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil, who's standing center stage and advocating, at the top of his lungs, that which you would spend a lifetime opposing at the top of yours. You want to claim this land as the land of the free, then the symbol of your country can't just be a flag; the symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest." Show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms. Then you can stand up and sing about the land of the free. I've known Bob Rumson for years. I've been operating under the assumption that the reason Bob devotes so much time and energy to shouting at the rain was that he simply didn't get it. Well, I was wrong.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Bob's problem isn't that he doesn't get it. Bob's problem is that he can't sell it. Nobody has ever won an election by talking about what I was just talking about.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This is a country made up of people with hard jobs that they're terrified of losing. The roots of freedom are of little or no interest to them at the moment. We are a nation afraid to go out at night. We're a society that has assigned low priority to education and has looked the other way while our public schools have been decimated. We have serious problems to solve, and we need serious men to solve them. And whatever your particular problem is, friend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is not the least bit interested in solving it. He is interested in two things and two things only: Making you afraid of it and telling you who's to blame for it. That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you win elections. You gather a group of middle-aged, middle-class, middle- income voters who remember with longing an easier time, and you talk to them about family and American values and personal character. Then you have an old photo of the President's girlfriend. You scream about patriotism and you tell them she's to blame for their lot in life, you go on television and you call her a whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done nothing to you, Bob. She has done nothing but put herself through law school, prosecute criminals for five years, represent the interests of public school teachers for two years, and lobby for the safety of our natural resources.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Well that ends right now.</context>
      <utterance>You want a character debate? Fine, but you better stick with me, 'cause Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your league. I've loved two women in my life. I lost one to cancer, and I lost the other 'cause I was so busy keeping my job I forgot to do my job.</utterance>

      <utterance>Tomorrow morning the White House is sending a bill to Congress for its consideration. It's White House Resolution 455, an energy bill requiring a 20 percent reduction of the emission of fossil fuels over the next ten years. It is by far the most aggressive stride ever taken in the fight to reverse the effects of global warming. The other piece of legislation is the crime bill. As of today it no longer exists. I'm throwing it out. I'm throwing it out and writing a law that makes sense. You cannot address crime prevention without getting rid of assault weapons and handguns. I consider them a threat to national security, and I will go door to door if I have to, but I'm gonna convince Americans that I'm right, and I'm gonna get the guns. We've got serous problems, and we need serious men, and if you want to talk about character, Bob, you'd better come at me with more than a burning flag and a membership card. If you want to talk about character and American values, fine. Just tell me where and when, and I'll show up. This is a time for serious men, Bob, and your fifteen minutes are up. My name's Andrew Shepherd, and I am the President. SHEPHERD exits the press room, leaving a stunned room in his wake. The MURMURS begin from the PRESS CORPS.
