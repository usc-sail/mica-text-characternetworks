      <utterance>Hi, Chris.  I'm so glad you came.  I still have a little time, and I want to tell you something. To warn you. By now you know about me, or if you don't, get Snow or Sartorius to tell you; it doesn't matter.  I didn't lose my mind. You should be able to tell from this video. I'm not mad.  If it happens to you, remember that it isn't madness.  You should know, I'm in favor of destroying Solaris. I know that's... illegal. And unethical. And irresponsible. But it's the only way to make it stop.</utterance>

      <utterance>A pre-biological colloidal envelope, possibly exceeding terrestrial structures in complexity; a plasmic mechanism. Probably without life as we conceive it, but capable of performing functional activities on an astronomic scale. My view is that Solaris has reached, in a single bound, the "homeostatic ocean" stage without passing through stages of terrestrial evolution. I think it bypassed cellular development altogether. It hasn't taken endless eons to adapt itself to its environment, but in fact dominated its environment immediately. From the moment it existed, it was the most superior element in the Universe. And now it passes the time doing extravagant theoretical thinking about the Universe, with us as the cast.</utterance>
