      <context>As Mike skims his own net over the water, he glimpses a familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool. The brightly- colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible.</context>

      <context>Mike and Joshua stand near the spider tanks. A dozen aquariums on low shelves. Each glass tank replicates a specific environment: jungle, desert, cavern, pond, etc.</context>

   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search for food. A trap-door spider pops out of its camouflaged den like a jack-in-the-box. The arachnid yanks the cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond. Mike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spitting spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless insects.</context>
      <utterance>All from eating these bugs? Maybe I should try some.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>I could get away.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOSHUA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing crickets. He moves toward another tank that is covered with a towel.</context>
      <utterance>Imagine yourself the size of that fly. A scytodes spitter would be as big as a Cadillac. You'd be spider chow, kid.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Are the new tarantulas in here?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOSHUA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Joshua unveils the tank. Dirt floor. Several burrow entrances. Joshua pours in the bugs. A large, male tarantula comes out of a burrow. It pounces on a bug, then wraps its prey in webbing, turning the insect into a mummy-like bundle.</context>
      <utterance>Took me forever to get a breeding set of Chilean reds. I must have bribed every customs agent from Vegas to Santiago.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>That is too cool.</utterance>

   <speaker>JOSHUA</speaker>

      <context>Joshua leads Mike to the back of the tank. A network of subterranean tunnels is revealed. The male tarantulas scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings.</context>
      <utterance>The prey is cocooned alive so she can eat them in her nest. You know how women love breakfast in bed.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOSHUA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mike peers into a large den. The female tarantula steps out of the shadows. This is Consuela, the Chilean red tarantula.</context>
      <utterance>Take a look, the female of the species is three times as big as the male.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOSHUA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mike watches Consuela unwrap one of the mummified bundles. She begins to eat the paralyzed insect within.</context>
      <utterance>Say hello to Consuela.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOSHUA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>While it's still alive!</context>
      <utterance>She fills her prey with digestive acid to liquify the internal organs. Now watch... She'll drink her victim from the inside out.</utterance>

      <utterance>And you wonder why my mom doesn't like me hanging out with you.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOSHUA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly Consuela lunges at the glass. Mike recoils.</context>
      <utterance>Arachnids have been roaming the earth for millions of years. And they'll be here long after the human race is dead and buried.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>

      <context>Norman freezes. He hears SOMETHING MOVING around in the dark. And then a spine chilling... GROWL. Chris reacts to the noise. He can guess what's coming... The FEMALE TARANTULA steps out of the shadows. Consuela has grown to be as big as a Volkswagen MicroBus. By far the largest spider we've seen yet. Covered in hair. Massive eyes. Her two fangs are the size of machetes. Mike's eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis.</context>
      <utterance>They're giant babies!</utterance>

      <context>The fur on Consuela's back seems to undulate. There is something weird there. A lot of weird things. In fact... her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby tarantulas. As Consuela advances, she flicks several dart-sized quills off her belly right into Norman. A dark stain spreads across the drug dealer's shirt.</context>
      <utterance>Consuela?</utterance>
   <speaker>NORMAN</speaker>
