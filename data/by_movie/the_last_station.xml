      <context>The chanting grows in intensity. Tolstoy gets to his feet, walks to the window, shows himself to the crowd. A great shout goes up. Tolstoy lifts his hand for silence. Gradually, it comes.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, they won't move. We are gonna die here. Leo, Leo, go and say something to them. It's the only way we are gonna get out of here.</utterance>
   <speaker>TOLSTOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The cries begin. "Clear the tracks. Let them pass. Let them go." Tolstoy closes the door and waves to the crowd as the train pulls away.</context>
      <utterance>I have seen your banner. And Ive heard what you say. You think Im the hope of Russia, do you? Well, thats not true. You are the hope of Russia. The hope of all the world. You say, you want a new way to live? Well, you are not gonna find it making a fuss over me. So, I suggest that you get on with your work and let a poor old men get on with his.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tolstoy does not approve of sexual relations. I know this.</utterance>

   <speaker>CHERTKOV</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't want to belabor the point, but I arranged for a manservant last year who proceeded to ruin two housemaids just like that. He was very upset.</utterance>
   <speaker>VALENTIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Chertkov nods his approval, begins to worry his moustache.</context>
      <utterance>This would not be a problem. I'm celibate. I'm also a strict vegetarian.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHERTKOV</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Valentin's face flushes with pride. Chertkov steals a glance at his reflection in the glass bookcase. One side of his moustache droops a little. He tugs awkwardly at it.</context>
      <utterance>Yes, I've heard many good things about you. I've even read what you`ve written. So has he.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHERTKOV</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>It's difficult to contain himself.</context>
      <utterance>My dear boy, if you were to become Tolstoy's private secretary, you would be given a great gift. You'll be with him every day, eat together, walk in the forest by his side.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, we have a lot to do if we are to get his work to the people.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yes, we. If we can encourage the spread of passive resistance...just think of it Valentin thousands of ordinary Russians casting off centuries of spiritual and political oppression-</utterance>

   <speaker>VALENTIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Chertkov walks to the window, signals Valentin to follow him. He points to TWO MEN IN PLAINCLOTHES standing in the street below.</context>
      <utterance>Enemies?</utterance>
   <speaker>CHERTKOV</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The Czar's police...You'll be followed when you leave here...and the church will stop at nothing to bring him back into the fold. His children can't be trusted... only Sasha... and then of course there is the Countess...  Well, one doesn't like to come between married people whatever the circumstances, but her dogged attachment to private property, her public criticism of our movement...</utterance>

      <utterance>CHERTKOV   The point is, he needs a man of your intellectual gifts around him. Someone who can help him with the new work. Someone who understands his goals.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHERTKOV</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Clearly upset, Chertkov pauses to get control of himself. He picks up a package, hands it to Valentin.</context>
      <utterance>And although they've allowed me to return to Russia, I can't see him. They keep me under house arrest... They might as well keep me in a cage.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHERTKOV</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Valentin looks at him, quizzical.</context>
      <utterance>So, I need you to put these letters directly into his hands. One can't be sure what gets through to him.</utterance>
