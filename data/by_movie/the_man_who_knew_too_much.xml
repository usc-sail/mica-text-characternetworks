      <context>On Hank's face comes a little understanding. He can barely believe what she means. Then he understands. He turns, and deliberately facing the door, starts to whistle the song. He whistles loud and vigorously. Mrs. Drayton stands up and moves back to a chair, as she watches him.</context>
      <utterance>Then go on -- whistle it. Whistle it as loud as you can.</utterance>
