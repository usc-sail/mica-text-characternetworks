      <context>The Man On the Bed answers it. Speaks haltingly.</context>
      <utterance>Eliminating the draft? Worst thing ever happened to pro football. Already you got Eric Dickerson, no team's good enough for him... You got Dion Sanders, this guy, Bosworth, bunch of peacocks. Nagurski, I saw him play for 25 bucks a game. And he woulda played for free, you get me? He loved the game. Nowadays? Forget about it. The TELEPHONE SHRILLS in the stillness.</utterance>

      <utterance>And so L.A. has a chance to ice the game, no pun intended... And you gotta be thinking, give the ball to Billy Cole. He has had an outstanding day, racking up 138 yards against a tough defense.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOWN ON FIELD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The L.A. team trudges through the snow to the line of scrimmage. Cole adopts a three-point stance. Everything happens in hyper-real SLOW MOTION: The snow falls. The receivers breeze past, in motion to begin their patterns. Moving like gazelles. Cole's fingers paw the cold earth. Gouging it. He is like a spring. Coiled and ready. The ball is snapped. Turf and snow. Erupting. A firecracker series of POPS as linemen collide. Legs churning.</context>

      <context>The Kid, of course, shrieks. And the light of sanity dawns in Hallenbeck's eyes. He sucks in a deep breath. Releases the struggling Kid. Swears under his breath. Watches the boys flee in terror. Notices a dead squirrel in his lap. Scowls. Heaves it out the window. Pumps a Camel into his mouth. Lights it. Rescues the bottle of Seagrams. Thus begins his morning. He opens the car door. The sprinkler douses him. He gets out. Stands on the lawn. One of the Kids, the toughest one, is standing on the sidewalk.</context>

Guys who fought for their hometown. Anymore, no one gives a shit. Ever since Sonny Werblin paid $400,000 to Joe Namath back in '66, the sons of bitches just got greedier. Playing only for themselves.
