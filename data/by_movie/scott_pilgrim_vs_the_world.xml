Matthew was the only non-white, non-jock boy in school, probably in the entire state, so we joined forces and took 'em all out. We were one hell of a team. Nothing could beat Matthew's mystical powers. Nothing but pre-teen capriciousness. We only kissed once. After a week and a half, I told him to hit the showers.</utterance>

I approached a deep cave and went through a crazy ordeal, during which I totally seized the sword. Sadly, I died. Then I resurrected! Now I realize what I should have been fighting for all along.
