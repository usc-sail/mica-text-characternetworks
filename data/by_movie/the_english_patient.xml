      <context>Hana leans under the tarpaulin, holding some DOLLARS. The two hands - hers and Jan's - reach for each other as the vehicles bump along side by side. They laugh at the effort. Jan's GOLD BRACELET catches the sun and glints.</context>

      <context>The Jeep accelerates away. Hana sighs to the patient. Suddenly AN EXPLOSION shatters the calm as the jeep runs over a MINE. The jeep is THROWN into the air. The convoy halts and there's chaos as soldiers run back pulling people out of the vehicles. Hana runs the other way, towards the accident, until she is prevented from passing by a soldier.</context>

      <context>By way of an answer she looks at the ground ahead of her feet. Jan's BRACELET lies in the mud. Hardy bends down and collects the mangled bracelet, presses it into Hana's hands.</context>

      <context>21a . EXT. BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL. DAY. LATER and a smart new aeroplane, a STEERMAN, makes a smooth landing on the flat desert. The expedition team drives over to meet the arrivals. Almsy is not with them. He's walking, apparently not so enthusiastic. A young, kissed and newly-married couple emerge from the plane. They are GEOFFREY AND KATHARINE CLIFTON. And it's immediately clear that Katharine is the woman in the plane- crash at the beginning of the film. Madox makes all the introductions. Hands are shaken, hellos all round, as the couple disembark in their leather flying gear. Geoffrey removes his helmet and, in what we will come to know as an ubiquitous gesture, produces a bottle of CHAMPAGNE and sets off the cork with a flourish.</context>

   <speaker>ALMSY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.

      <context>The Guide speaks, amplifying something, picking at his robe.</context>
      <utterance>The Ostrich is a detour. A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method. Nothing to do with Zerzura. To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move. The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run. At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards. When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer.  Haunting the ostrich.</utterance>
   <speaker>ALMSY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He shrugs. The Arab has more to say. Almsy doesn't respond, quieting him with a dismissive gesture.</context>
      <utterance>Yes, the ostrich, it will feed a family, not just the meat, but by selling the feathers, beak, the skin, a year from this one animal. So, each day the man gets closer. And the ostrich is not sure - has something changed? - now the standing man is only a few yards from where it feeds. And then one day, the man is in the wadi, in the water. And the Ostrich comes, as always, dips into the water and the man JUMPS UP - and captures it.</utterance>

Almasy immediately returns to the two damaged vehicles and helps the men stretch the cut canvas which was once a tent TO FASHION A MAKESHIFT SHELTER BETWEEN THE TWO CARS. Katharine goes to join them. There is no obstacle to the remorseless horizon, just miles of undulating dunes.</context>
      <utterance>I insist. There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts. Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic. Almsy shrugs.</utterance>

      <context>Mller doesn't even pay attention, he's going through a file. Pulls out some photographs, starts spreading them out.</context>
      <utterance>I keep explaining. You've got the wrong man. My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini. Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.</utterance>

      <context>THE PHONE rings again, is answered. The Clerk calls to Mller who gets up, irritably. Caravaggio addresses the room.</context>
      <utterance>You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies. Code-name Moose.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARAVAGGIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nobody responds. Mller is irascible on the phone, checking his watch, negotiating time. The call finishes.</context>

   <speaker>CARAVAGGIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mller nods at the Clerk, who instantly gets up. Just then the telephone rings again. He hesitates.</context>
      <utterance>A nurse? Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse? Great.</utterance>
   <speaker>MœLLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Clerk exits. The phone rings. The Stenographer is plagued by flies. Suddenly he slaps at one.</context>
      <utterance>Leave it and get the nurse!</utterance>
   <speaker>MœLLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why is there so much nose? I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something. So we can all get out of this room. A name. A code.  It's too hot.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARAVAGGIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The NURSE comes in. She is Arab and her head is covered.</context>
      <utterance>I slept with the girl. I've got a wife in Tripoli. A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.</utterance>
   <speaker>MœLLER</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll tell you what I'm going to do. This is your nurse, by the way. She's Moslem, so she'll understand all of this. What's the punishment for adultery? Let's leave it at that. You're married and you were fucking another woman, so that's - is it the hands that are cut off? Or is that for stealing? Does anyone know? There's silence. Mller turns to Caravaggio.</utterance>
   <speaker>MœLLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, you must know. You were brought up Libya, yes?</utterance>

      <utterance>Or was it Toronto?</utterance>
   <speaker>CARAVAGGIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Now the phone starts again. The CLERK picks it up, there's a terse exchange, he puts the receiver on the desk, waits for the moment to interrupt Mller.</context>
      <utterance>Don't cut me. Come on.</utterance>
   <speaker>MœLLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>No response. Mller opens his palms to Caravaggio.</context>
      <utterance>Ten fingers. How about this? You give me a name for every finger - doesn't matter who. I get something, you keep something. I'm trying to be reasonable. Fenelon-Barnes, we could call that two names.  Are thumbs fingers?  Is a thumb a finger?</utterance>
   <speaker>MœLLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I get no help from these people.</utterance>
   <speaker>CLERK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mller walks over, takes the receiver and slams it down. an AIR RAID SIREN is going off somewhere, and now the faint sound of explosions is also discernible, but all muffled in this room with the steady clack- clack of the STENOGRAPHER. At that moment, Mller suddenly becomes aware of what is happening. He turns on the Stenographer.</context>
      <utterance>The telephone -</utterance>
   <speaker>MœLLER</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>What are you doing?</utterance>
   <speaker>STENOGRAPHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mller peremptorily rips out the paper, throws it on the floor.</context>
      <utterance>That Geneva Convention. I'm -</utterance>
   <speaker>CARAVAGGIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>DURING THIS Mller's gone to the table, pulled out a drawer and produced A CUT-THROAT RAZOR. He hands it to the nurse, makes a line across his own left thumb and jerks his head towards Caravaggio. The nurse is extremely reluctant. Mller claps his hands, pushes her towards Caravaggio.</context>
      <utterance>You can't do that! Hey - come on!</utterance>
   <speaker>MœLLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Caravaggio is in terror.</context>
      <utterance>Go! Hey! Go!</utterance>
   <speaker>CARAVAGGIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The guards come away from the door and press down on Caravaggio's shoulders to prevent him from moving. The nurse, grim-faced, approaches, kneels at the table.</context>
      <utterance>Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus Christ.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARAVAGGIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And then he SCREAMS AND SCREAMS and jerks up, carrying the guards and the table with him, all heaving off the ground, the nurse thrown off balance. He falls to the floor, ROARING WITH PAIN, blood everywhere, the table on top of him. The AIR RAID is continuing outside, the PHONE IS RINGING, the nurse stands, pale, blood all over her uniform.</context>
      <utterance>Listen, I'll give you a name. What name did you say? I knew them! I promise. Please - please!</utterance>
   <speaker>MœLLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He stabs at his own right thumb.</context>
      <utterance>Cut the other thumb.</utterance>
   <speaker>MœLLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The nurse, horrified, shakes her head. Mller snatches the razor from her and heads towards the prostate Caravaggio. One Guard has got to his feet and grips Caravaggio around the neck in half-nelson, others holding his legs, while Mller approaches. Caravaggio can't move. He's gurgling as the Guard almost strangles him. His eyes are streaming with tears. Now Mller is at his other hand, and the ROAR of pain again lifts Caravaggio to his feet, THE WHOLE TABLE RISING IN THE AIR, his mutilated hands slipping from the handcuffs lie Houdini, the drawers of the table SPILLING their contents everywhere, before he sinks to his knees like a gored bull and BLACKS OUT.</context>
      <utterance>This one! Come on!</utterance>

      <utterance>When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.</utterance>

      <utterance>Can you hear? Can you hear what they're celebrating? I listened to you, Uncle. Sitting at your feet - always sitting at somebody's feet - trying to learn.

      <context>Kip levels the gun at the Patient. Then breaks it open, throws it down on the bed, next to the earphones, from which the news continues to leak, some words audible - Eunola Gay... Hiroshima... and from different voices - It was beautiful! just beautiful! Bang! the biggest bang you ever saw!</context>
      <utterance>Kip, listen, he lost everything because he wasn't English - Jesus! - shoot me, I'm more English than he is!</utterance>
