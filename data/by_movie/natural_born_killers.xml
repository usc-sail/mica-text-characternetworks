      <utterance>The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.</utterance>

      <utterance>No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.</utterance>

   <speaker>MABEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX, Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. Her back is to the camera as well.</context>
      <utterance>Should I make that two pieces?</utterance>
   <speaker>MALLORY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nada, Rosey.</utterance>
   <speaker>MABEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mabel exits FRAME.</context>
      <utterance>My name's not Rosey.  It's Mabel.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALLORY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter, she selects a quarter.</context>
      <utterance>Whatever.</utterance>
   <speaker>MABEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball. As his eyes follow Mallory, he loses his ball. She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter, selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record, and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee shop. Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, what the hell do you think you're doin'?</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee shop. She's really cooking and smoking. Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the hell these people are. Mickey isn't paying much attention. He's too busy enjoying his pie and milk.</context>
      <utterance>I can't take her anywhere.</utterance>

      <utterance>Good God almighty. What the hell is that?</utterance>
   <speaker>OTIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Otis and Sonny exchange looks.</context>
      <utterance>That's a bitch outta hell, son.</utterance>
   <speaker>SONNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Otis heads toward Mallory. Sonny moves over to the counter next to Mickey.</context>
      <utterance>Take a run at 'er, kiddo.</utterance>
   <speaker>SONNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Miller, Mabel.</utterance>
   <speaker>MABEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Otis stands in front of Mallory, trying to copy what she's doing. Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see him. Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Sonny. Sonny takes a swig, enjoying the floor show.</context>
      <utterance>Comin' up.</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The needle lifts off the record. The song ends. Mallory opens her eyes and sees Otis.</context>
      <utterance>Her name's Mallory.</utterance>
   <speaker>OTIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Otis gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to Sonny. Sonny gurgles out a laugh.</context>
      <utterance>Hells Bells! Don't stop now sugar. I'm just getting warmed up.</utterance>
   <speaker>SONNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Otis turns to Mallory as she PUNCHES him hard in the face spinning him around. Sonny spews his mouthful of Highlife. Mallory grabs the back of Otis' head and SMASHES it down on the table, cracking the linoleum. Otis buckles, dropping to his knees. Sonny jumps off the counter stool, but Mickey's hand clutches hold of his shoulder. Sonny spins around toward Mickey, loaded for bear, and points his finger at him, threateningly. Before any threat can be made, Mickey whips a large buck knife out from its sheath, and in a flash, SLICES off Sonny's finger. Sonny's finger drops on his boot. He grabs his aching hand. Blood flows from the wound.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, I think she's sweet on you.</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS. The buck knife slips back into its sheath. At first, there seems to be no difference with Sonny. Finally, blood flows from the slices made in his face and chest. Sonny collapses. The SHORT-ORDER COOK charges out of the kitchen at Mickey, wielding a meat cleaver and screaming. Mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside his jacket and FIRES. BULLET'S POV: Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face. It HITS. Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to the ground, screaming. Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass window. Earl's watched the whole shebang. Earl mouths 'Fuck!' He turns and runs for it. Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which SHATTERS. The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back. He hits the ground dead. Mickey turns to Mallory. She's sitting on op of Otis, SLAMMING his head repeatedly on the floor.</context>
      <utterance>Just because my woman's mopping up the floor with your buddy is no reason for you to join in.</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mallory looks up at Mickey. She gets off Otis and moves to Mickey's side. Mickey trains his .45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his cowboy boots. Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching the coffee pot, crying.</context>
      <utterance>Honey.</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy.</context>
      <utterance>Pick one.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALLORY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She ends, pointing at Mabel. Mabel's crying. She screams.</context>
      <utterance>Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a nigger by the tow. If he hollers, let him go. Eanie, meanie, minie, moe. My mom told me to pick the best one and you are it.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>No response from Mickey.</context>
      <utterance>We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come.  I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Well, whatta ya say?</context>
      <utterance>My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies.</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.</utterance>

      <utterance>Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case. Mickey cracks a smile.</utterance>

A national TV interview would be very advantageous to both Mallory and I. The only obstacle is they're shipping me out to the funny farm in four days. However, that is your problem and not mine.

In response to his last remark, they all pretend they are praying to him. The team consists of SCOTT, the cameraman, who wears wild t-shirts (presently a t-shirt with the movie 'She Devils On Wheels' splashed on the front); ROGER, the soundman, who wears wild Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts; and UNRULY JULIE, Wayne's assistant, a young lady who wears Bermuda shorts, a baseball jersey, and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the weather is at any time. Roger's never seen without his recorder, Scott's never without his camera, and Unruly Julie always has her giant notebook. These dishevelled film types are all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to Wayne's stylish yuppie demeanour. Unruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle. The guys hold out coffee mugs, while Julie fills. Julie, however drinks straight from the bottle. NOTE: This scene is to be played at a rapid fire 'His Girl Friday' pace.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>It was dramatic license, no doubt. But I felt an operatic love story needed an operatic ending. The two of them kill for each other. They offer the death of their victims to each other like other lovers offer flowers or bon bons. So what more natural, what more organic, what more poetic than Mallory offering her death to Mickey? It's where it's been leading since day one. We worked it in the movie by using a what if they escaped situation. I think it works beautifully. You'd be surprised. People come up to me at the end of the movie in tears.</utterance>

      <utterance>I didn't play Mallory, the murderer. I didn't play her as a butcher. I played her as a woman in love, who also happens to murder people. I didn't want her to be at arm's length from the audience or myself. If you play her as this wild maniac, the audience never has to deal with her. If you see a decapitation in a movie, you just say 'Oh wow, a neat special effect.' Because you can't relate to a decapitation. It doesn't mean anything to anybody because it's not personal. Decapitations don't fall into most people's realm of life experiences. But if you show somebody in a movie getting a paper cut, the whole audience squirms. Because everybody can relate to a paper cut.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, for one, the media has done a tremendous job of turning the husband and wife mass murderers into celebrities. But it's the country's youth who have turned the couple into the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically, the very thing that makes them most lethal is the exact same thing that captures the public's hearts and minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic devotion to each other. In a world where people can't seem to make the simplest relationships work and the slightest emotional commitment is considered devastating, Mick and Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a Shakespearean magnitude. To the country's youth, 75 percent of which are coming from broken homes, that's appealing. They have an 'us against the world' posture which always appeals to youth. And they've taken that posture seventeen steps beyond. It's not 'us against the world,' it's 'we're gonna kill the world.' They're exciting. I read their file and I find myself turning the page like it was a paperback. Why do disillusioned youths get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do disillusioned housewives read romance novels? Why are you filming this special? Because you know as well as I do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles Manson speaks,' everybody's going to tune in to hear what he says. Mickey and Mallory have shocked a country numb with violence. They've created a world where only two exist and anybody who inadvertently enters that world is murdered.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Was there any vengeance on your part with your unique sentence?</utterance>
   <speaker>JUDGE STEINSMA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, unquestionably. After they did what they did in my court, and judge worth his robe will tell you the same thing. It couldn't help but affect my decision. That's why they have judges. We're supposed to be fair to a fault, but when it's showtime, we have to make a decision. That's why we don't just input all the facts into a computer for the appropriate punishment. I couldn't give them the death penalty. See, California hops back and forth on that issue. Mickey and Mallory went to court when it was out of favor, which is actually good because it leaves more room for imagination. Anybody can give somebody the chair. When you have someone who deserves to die and you can't kill them, you have to be creative. And if the bastards had let it stand, it would of been the perfect sentence. It hit 'em right where they lived. Far more punishing than the death sentence.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Would you please describe for our viewers what your sentence was?</utterance>
   <speaker>JUDGE STEINSMA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, in a rogue's gallery of killers, Mickey and Mallory are very unique. I've seen a lot of killers in my day and they're a very cold lot. They have no more feelings about taking a person's life than squashing a tiny bug. It's all the same to them. Well, Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em to watch their expression change' attitude personified. Except with each other. And, since they lived only for each other, I wanted to attack that, at its very root. So, in a nutshell, my sentence was double life for each without any possibility for parole. That would be fairly standard in their case. The twist I added was that the husband and wife would have no contact or correspondence with each other for the rest of their lives. And they would never receive any word or information about the other. So, basically once the cell door slams shut, Mickey and Mallory will completely disappear from each other's life. They'll never know when the other dies. But alas, the best laid plans of mice and men...</utterance>

      <utterance>...that they were mentally ill and needed to be transferred to a state mental hospital.</utterance>

      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We talked with Dewight McClusky, chairman of the California State Prison Board, about this curious turn of events in the Mickey and Mallory case.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?</utterance>
   <speaker>MCCLUSKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>What's changed?</context>
      <utterance>Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused.</utterance>
   <speaker>MCCLUSKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?</utterance>
   <speaker>MCCLUSKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>

      <utterance>Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>PHOTO: of DR. FELIX VARGUS.</context>
      <utterance>The two psychiatric opinions the board sought were those of Albert Rodriguez...</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...and Dr. Felix Vargus. Both of the good doctors, for whatever reason, refused to be interviewed.</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. REINGHOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's a funny situation actually. If anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give a damn, what the prison board is doing would be considered an outrage. The prison board is basically saying, 'We can't handle these guys.' They've moved 'em around twice since their sentence started. They were a handful everywhere they went. Now the prisons they're at now want them outta there. But no other prison's gonna be stupid enough to take 'em. So the prison board is left scratching their heads wondering what they're gonna do. Well, what they decided to do was to set up a kangaroo medical court that found them crazy. Then they get them transferred to Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay as it's referred to in the psychiatric circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and electro shock diet, and Mickey and Mallory cease to be a problem to anybody except the orderlies who clean out the bedpans, which if you want to see them get theirs, that's all well and good. But there's something being said here. Forget the immorality for a second. Forget the corruption and the skulduggery involved. What the board is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and Mallory ran amuck in polite society. They were put in an alternative society and they ran amuck there, too. All the powers that be, can't deal with these two kids. And whatever can't be assimilated has to be terminated.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory are not insane?</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. REINGHOLD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>FREEZE FRAME on Dr. Reinghold.</context>
      <utterance>Insane, no. Psychotic, yes. A menace to living creatures, yes. But to suggest that they're insane gives the impression that they don't know right from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know the difference between right and wrong. They just don't give a damn.</utterance>

      <utterance>But I came to the direction I need a gun. Do, the next day I started off early for work, and I'm gonna stop by a gun shop and pick up a little home protection. I walked into the place and had never seen so many guns in all my life. So, I'm lookin' around, the this really nice sales guy comes up to me. His name was Warren. I'll never forget his name. He was really nice. Anyway, Warren showed me all these different models of guns. Magnums, automatics, pistols, Walters. And I ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a Mossberg pump action shotgun. As soon as I held that baby in my hands, I knew what I was gonna do. It felt so good. It felt like it was a part of me. They had a mirror in the store. I looked at myself holding it, and looked so fuckin' good, I immediately bought it. Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo. Turned my car around, drove to Mallory's house, we took care of Mallory's parents, packed up the car, and we were off.</utterance>

      <context>The caravan marches forth. Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their speeches. Nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep their weapons ready. Wayne stops his speech to take a breath.</context>
      <utterance>It is happening.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALLORY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The deputies are completely frustrated. Mickey and Wurlitzer are nose to nose.</context>
      <utterance>Don't stop! Wayne starts up again.</utterance>

      <utterance>I will personally hunt you down, blow the head off your fucking-whore-wife, and plant your sick ass in the ground all by myself.</utterance>

      <utterance>This is Wayne Gayle. I'm wounded and my crew, Roger and Scott, are dead. This may be out of sync 'cause we are shooting with a wild camera and a standard recorder we found in the van. Mickey Knox's plan worked. We walked out the front door, into my news van and made our getaway. When we were followed by patrol cars, Mallory Knox killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka and tossed his body out of the back. Mickey told authorities over my police band that I would surely be next if they didn't give up the pursuit. They took Mickey at his word and called off the pursuit. Why helicopters weren't employed, I don't know. My only thought is it all happened too fast for arrangements to be made. We've just pulled off to the side of the road to do this interview. Tensions run high-- Mickey screams O.S.</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKEY</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We ain't got all fuckin' day!</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wayne steps forward and picks up the CAMERA and while conducting his interview, the CAMERA remains hand held. CAMERA focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces in and out of FRAME in the B.G.</context>
      <utterance>Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?</utterance>
   <speaker>MALLORY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What did you think then?</utterance>
   <speaker>MALLORY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?</utterance>
   <speaker>MALLORY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Try to keep it to a minimum.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALLORY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit -- Mickey can be heard faintly in the B.G.</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Divine intervention.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALLORY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mickey's snapping his fingers in the B.G.</context>
      <utterance>What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So, what now?</utterance>
   <speaker>MALLORY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALLORY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mickey approaches Wayne. CAMERA goes a little haywire as Wayne lowers it from his eye.</context>
      <utterance>Okay, that's enough. End of interview. We gotta move.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>Mickey takes the CAMERA from Wayne, and while he speaks, he balances it on a fence post.</context>
      <utterance>Okay, just let me swing around and film myself asking the questions. And then I'll do my little wrap up.</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wayne forces a chuckle. Mickey steps away from the CAMERA and into a THREE SHOT. The NEWS VAN is parked in the B.G.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up, all right. But it won't be you starin' in the camera, looking dumb, and acting stupid. Instead, you're gonna be starin' down the barrels of our shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the triggers.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mickey pumps the slide of his shotgun. Mallory grabs her shotgun from off the ground.</context>
      <utterance>That's a joke right?</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Just wait one fucking minute.</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?</utterance>
   <speaker>MALLORY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Looked like an interview to me.</utterance>

      <utterance>I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Wait! I don't know, but I kinda felt during this...this whole escape that a kind of bond-- Wayne is shaking.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No. Not really.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wayne is grasping for anything.</context>
      <utterance>Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAYNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.</utterance>
   <speaker>MICKEY</speaker>

      <context>Mickey turns to Mallory.</context>
      <utterance>We are.  Your camera.</utterance>
