      <utterance>-- and I could have waited to tell you, but I wanted to leave no room for misunderstanding.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, you certainly didn't.</utterance>

   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, I see how you could feel this way. Of course I do. It's human. But what I don't get is why you'd want to announce it so quickly. I mean, we just met. Feelings change. You don't even know me.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She is amused by his confidence --</context>
      <utterance>Yes, I do.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, really?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The minute I laid eyes on you. It's the saddest thing about getting older. You know people so quickly. I even knew you'd end up hating me.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, you're wrong. I don't.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She laughs. Then he stops. He hears something. She stops. She hears it, too. It's a GIRL'S VOICE. He casually turns and looks, squinting into the sun. He takes a few steps and there, between trees, he sees TWO DOZEN PEOPLE sitting on the grass and on folding chairs -- most are middle-aged or older with a distinctly intellectual- bohemian look to them. Standing and addressing them is CHARLOTTE FIELDING, 19, fair, willowy, pale, lovely in an unconventional way. She wears an eccentric hat and a vintage dress. Her bearing is upright, her gaze warm and intelligent, her voice rich with emotion --</context>
      <utterance>Give it time.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The woman whispers in Wills' ear --</context>
      <utterance>-- and for weeks I sat by her bed and cried. I told her I loved her and I begged her not to leave me. All I could think about was what I'd lose if she died. And then one night... she was in really bad pain... I stopped thinking about myself for a second and I thought about her.  I stopped crying. I said goodbye. And in less than an hour Ella was gone.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But Wills ignores her. He watches Charlotte with keen interest, touched by the depth and sincerity of her emotion.</context>
      <utterance>It's so sad.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She looks out at the group, many of whom are crying. A tear runs down her cheek. She smiles and wipes it away. The woman, seeing Wills' interest in the girl, whispers --</context>
      <utterance>I really think it's possible to hold a person back... cry them back... from dying. That's what I did to Ella and I'll never do it to anyone else again.  I hope no one ever does it to me.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He knows a great deal. Or at least he thinks he does. But his answer is nonchalant --</context>
      <utterance>So what do you know about her?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He takes the woman gently by the elbow and guides her away. He steals one last look back. Charlotte, returning to where she was sitting, notices Wills. Their eyes meet and a charge passes between them. Meanwhile an OLD MAN has risen from his chair --</context>
      <utterance>That she's just a kid.</utterance>
   <speaker>OLD MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wills slowly turns and walks away.</context>
      <utterance>I met Ella at City College in 1938...</utterance>

   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She dumps her boxes and bags, then wheels in the mannequin.</context>
      <utterance>Shit.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>

      <utterance>Dolly! The bulb burned out!</utterance>

   <speaker>TANYA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, Wills, please, not again. It's our third date and we're already in a rut.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She stretches with her cigarette but before she can make it to the ashtray, her ASH FALLS on a New York magazine. On the cover is a PHOTOGRAPH OF WILLS standing next to a YOUNG CHEF in a fashionable restaurant. The caption reads: "The Prodigal Son Returns."</context>
      <utterance>But I thought you loved it.</utterance>
   <speaker>TANYA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, I do -- except for the fact that there isn't a single thing on the menu I can eat.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He slips in a cuff link. She affects a breezy indifference --</context>
      <utterance>Sure, there is; there's just very little you're willing to digest.</utterance>
   <speaker>TANYA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wills slips on a silk tie --</context>
      <utterance>Fine then. We'll go, I'll get big, fat, and horrible, and it'll serve you right.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, it won't. Because it takes at least a few weeks to get fat and by then you won't even be speaking to me.</utterance>
   <speaker>TANYA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He stops tying his tie and stares at her in the mirror --</context>
      <utterance>Why do you say that?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He goes back to tying his tie, then adds softly --</context>
      <utterance>Because we have no future. All I can offer you is this... what we have right now... nothing more meaningful... until it ends.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She stares at him, speechless.</context>
      <utterance>I could have waited to tell you, but I wanted to leave no room for misunderstanding.</utterance>

   <speaker>JESUS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Good evening, Mr. Keane. Will you be dining with us tonight?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We certainly will. Table seven, Jesus, if it's available.</utterance>
   <speaker>JESUS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wills hands Eriko's jacket to MELISSA, 20, the hat check girl --</context>
      <utterance>Yes, sir.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How are you, Melissa?</utterance>
   <speaker>MELISSA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>CELIA, mid-20's, the chipper, blonde Midwestern hostess, arrives, wearing a stunned, glassy smile.</context>
      <utterance>Fine, Mr. Keane.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Good evening, Celia. And how --</utterance>
   <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Just dandy, sir, thanks!</utterance>
   <speaker>JESUS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Table seven.</utterance>
   <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Celia, barely making eye contact with Eriko, walks quickly away. Wills is amused and a little confused by Celia's behavior. He lays a hand on Eriko's back --</context>
      <utterance>This way, please.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wills moves to the reservation stand where his best friend and the restaurant's manager, JOHN VOLPE, 40, a brilliant, dapper, tough as nails Brooklynite stands, listening to someone on the telephone. Wills lays a hand on his shoulder and mutters into his ear --</context>
      <utterance>I'll be right with you. Eriko nods and follows Celia.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How's it going?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Chaos.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The house specialty.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wills laughs and takes a look into the bar. John gestures with his head in Eriko's direction --</context>
      <utterance>Easy for you to say, ya prick. Waltzin' in here like you own the joint.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So who's the new potential ex-wife? I thought you were still wastin' time with Tanya-von-What's-her-name.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wills exits into the bar. John smiles and shakes his head. FOLLOW WILLS, as he glides along the bar. CUSTOMERS and STAFF greet him warmly. As he enters the main dining room, DINERS spot him -- sprinkled among them are CELEBRITIES from every walk of city life. Wills greets them, stopping to shake their hands and kiss their cheeks. Suddenly, Celia, the hostess, red-faced, blocks his path --</context>
      <utterance>We wisely agreed to cut our losses.</utterance>
   <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look, I have no right to say this, okay? And you can fire me if you want, but in the six weeks we've been open you've brought in six different women -- tonight makes seven -- and it's really starting to get to me.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>In what way?</utterance>
   <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have to greet them! It's like working at a dog shelter! I'm afraid to learn their names or even smile at them because I know any minute they could be put down!</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Shocked, she can't help but sputter a laugh --</context>
      <utterance>I assure you it's an absolutely painless procedure.</utterance>
   <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It is?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They both laugh. He moves closer, lowers his voice, and speaks with warm sincerity --</context>
      <utterance>Sure.  Especially for me.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Actually, I appreciate your concern, Celia. The truth is I'm a little worried myself.</utterance>
   <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Seriously?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Seriously. I've been trying to do better.  But... you know how it is... old habits die hard.</utterance>
   <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So I'm not fired?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wills smiles, pats her in the shoulder, and moves on. She can't believe it. A WAITER carrying a BIRTHDAY CAKE -- blazing with candles and decorated with a WOMAN'S HAT made of MERINGUE LATTICEWORK -- passes by on his way to the REAR DINING ROOM. From inside, VOICES begin to sing HAPPY BIRTHDAY. Wills, his curiosity piqued, follows.</context>
      <utterance>Nope. In fact, John's been looking for an assistant. Tell him you've just been promoted.</utterance>
</dialogue>

<dialogue id="6" n_utterances="49">
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Charlotte blows hard, and, with a little more effort than you might expect, extinguishes the candles. Everyone APPLAUDS and CHEERS. To Charlotte's right sits SIMON LORING, late 20's, English, sardonic, adoring. He gestures at her CHEST and says --</context>
      <utterance>You guys! Let me think!  Okay. Okay.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Everyone laughs. Charlotte playfully slaps him --</context>
      <utterance>Watch carefully, everyone -- they ought to begin emerging any moment now.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Very funny! Actually, any moment now you're gonna turn straight and fall at my feet.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Charlotte's best friend, SHANNON HARRIS, 19, a spoiled but big-hearted redhead, drowning in curls, mutters --</context>
      <utterance>Oh, darling, you know I would if I could.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHANNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>BACK TO WILLS. He considers approaching Charlotte, but then he looks back and sees Eriko sitting alone at their table, idly stabbing at her drink with a straw. Regretting his rudeness, he takes a step toward her, but then hears --</context>
      <utterance>The only time he falls at your feet now is when he wants to borrow your Prada loafers. More laughter.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He turns and sees DOLORES TALBOT, 70, blonde wig, spindly frame, weathered skin, large, sad eyes. She holds a mixed drink --</context>
      <utterance>Is that Wills Keane?</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It sure as hell is and he hasn't changed a bit!</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry, do I --</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His smile shows uneasy surprise --</context>
      <utterance>You little fool, it's Dolores Talbot. Dolly!</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>My God, it is.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOLLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As he hugs Dolores, he can't help but look over at Charlotte again.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah, I know, time's kicked my ass but good. Come on, Romeo, let's bury the hatchet. Give me a hug. Careful of the cocktail.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOLLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So what the hell're you doin' around here? Last I heard you were out in earthquake country blowin' the family fortune.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Actually, I doubled it.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOLLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ON CHARLOTTE. She looks over. Her view is such that she sees Wills but not Dolores. A faint blush creeps into Charlotte's cheeks. She pretends to listen as Shannon tells a story --</context>
      <utterance>Good for you!</utterance>
   <speaker>SHANNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Noticing Charlotte's distraction, Simon whispers calmly to her --</context>
      <utterance>-- and you know how bouncer's get. He's like, "That's the worst fake I.D. I've ever seen." And I'm like, "Yeah? Well, you have the worst dread- extensions!" And then just when --</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Charlotte speaks under her breath without moving her lips --</context>
      <utterance>Are you feeling all right? You look positively green.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's here. And he's staring at me again.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHANNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Both Shannon and Simon turn to look, but like lightning Charlotte grabs them both --</context>
      <utterance>No way!</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't!  Wait a few seconds, then go to the bathroom.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How will I know him?</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's beautiful. And much older.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>If he's rich you might have a fight on your hands. Charlotte watches furtively as Simon rises from his chair and walks over. As he passes Wills, he flashes him a seductive smile. Wills is confused by it.</context>
      <utterance>Really?</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Shannon swivels her head and throws an aloof, vacant stare in Wills' direction. Then she looks back at Charlotte, mouth agape --</context>
      <utterance>Okay, look.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHANNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>BACK ON WILLS. He does his best to be attentive as Dolores exhales a plume of smoke into his face --</context>
      <utterance>He's as old as my dad! Charlotte laughs.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOLLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sure, L.A.'s okay if you're a cactus or a lizard, but if you're a New Englander, your soul dries up and blows away like a god damn leaf.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It only took me twenty years to come to my senses.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOLLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ON CHARLOTTE. She sits listening to Shannon --</context>
      <utterance>So what're you doin' now? You owned some restaurants out there, didn't you?</utterance>
   <speaker>SHANNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Charlotte looks over and pales, her eyes widening --</context>
      <utterance>And so, after all that, we pay our cover, we get in, and it's totally heinous! Nothing but losers and --</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, shit.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHANNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What? Dolores walks up, hauling Wills by the arm --</utterance>
   <speaker>DOLLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The table greets him. Wills, slightly self-conscious, looks at everyone but Charlotte.</context>
      <utterance>Kids! I want you to meet an old chum of mine, the owner of this fine establishment -- Wills Keane!</utterance>
   <speaker>DOLLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The news hits Wills hard. But he does his best to hide it. He musters a casual smile --</context>
      <utterance>And that over there's the birthday girl -- my granddaughter, Charlotte.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not Katie and Jay's daughter?</utterance>
   <speaker>DOLLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dolores indicates the hat that Charlotte's wearing --</context>
      <utterance>You bet. She got her height from her dad. But her talent's all Katie's.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOLLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Shannon makes an elaborate comic show of modeling the hat she's wearing. The table laughs. Wills levels his gaze at Charlotte --</context>
      <utterance>Made it herself from scratch. That one, too.  Honey, show 'im.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Try as she might to accept the compliment with grace, Charlotte can't help but grin.</context>
      <utterance>Impressive.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The WINE STEWARD stands at a station on which sit TWO BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE on ice. He reaches for one. Wills stops him --</context>
      <utterance>Thanks.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The steward, understanding, nods and departs, taking the champagne with him.</context>
      <utterance>I think we can do better than that.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Happy birthday, Charlotte.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thanks.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHANNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Twenty years old and never been...</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Amused, he flashes Charlotte his most dazzling smile.</context>
      <utterance>Shut up!</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll let you get back to your celebration.  A pleasure to see you again.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOLLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wills turns to exit. Simon, returning to his seat, murmurs seductively to Wills as he passes by --</context>
      <utterance>Same here.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wills looks at him, confused again, then continues on. As Simon sits, he mutters to Charlotte --</context>
      <utterance>Leaving so soon?</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Be still my beating heart.  Or is that your heart?</utterance>
   <speaker>SHANNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Charlotte turns to Dolores who has just sat down.</context>
      <utterance>You're not really into him, are you?</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, Dolly, how do you know him?</utterance>
   <speaker>DOLLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dolores eats a sloppy forkful of birthday cake.</context>
      <utterance>From Newport. Old friend of your mom's.</utterance>

      <utterance>Oh my God, I'm so sorry! Wait. Who is this?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Her heart stops. She sits up slowly, her body tensed.</context>
      <utterance>Wills Keane.</utterance>

   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>My friend Simon, actually. He always calls me the morning after to sort of... you know... sum everything up.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And how would you sum it up, Charlotte? Turning twenty.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Kinda cool, kinda creepy. Anyway, you wanna speak to my grandmother?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>OLIVIA, 30's, Wills' Jamaican cook and housekeeper, enters. Plump, handsome, and perpetually amused, she carries a tray laden with continental breakfast and a New York Times. Wills mouths a greeting. She smiles back and sets the tray on a table.</context>
      <utterance>I don't think so.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I called because I'm going to be attending a benefit... a black-and- white ball.... and I'd like you to design a hat... for my date.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Really? Wow. Sounds fun. Okay.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's a gift. I don't have her measurements, but she's about your size. What're you, a six?</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Uh-huh.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Good -- then let's assume your hat size is also the same.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But that doesn't necessarily --</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Charlotte runs over to her sewing table, looking for a pen and paper. She finds paper, but no pen --</context>
      <utterance>It's a risk we'll just have to take.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She finds a pen but it doesn't work. She grabs an eyeliner and uses that --</context>
      <utterance>Her dress is a sheath... sleeveless, black. The hat must, of course, be black or white or both.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Any particular style?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, just plenty of it. How long will it take?</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A week or two.</utterance>

      <utterance>Really? Wow.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His tone has abruptly shifted; it's intimately hushed. It both daunts and excites her --</context>
      <utterance>Charlotte?</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah?</utterance>

      <utterance>Bye.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She clicks off the phone, wilts into a swoon on the bed, and breaks out laughing. Wills, still holding the receiver, stares dreamily into the middle distance. He snaps to when Olivia enters. Her accent is as much Queens as it is Caribbean --</context>
      <utterance>Bye.</utterance>
   <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You slept alone last night. You must be sick or somethin'. You want me to call a doctor?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She throws him a sly, sidelong glance, then exits. Wills laughs and contentedly sips his coffee. FROM THE NEXT SCENE, we hear the sound of SQUEALING, LAUGHING,</context>
      <utterance>Thank you, no, I'm fine.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is that what you think? Buddy, since we hit town, I have done nothin' but cut you slack! Every week a new woman on your arm and I didn't say a word. Why? 'Cause I figured at least they're in the right demographic. Maybe by accident you'll trip over something substantial. But this little girl? Best she could be is Miss Right's daughter!</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>

      <utterance>"She's young. She's hot. I'm on the verge of menopause. Why not go for it?" Wills and Sarah meet eyes.</utterance>

   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>John scoops both his daughters up in his arms and kisses them repeatedly. Wills watches, his eyes filling with a vague, wistful envy. He sees Sarah staring at him. She smiles sympathetically.</context>

   <speaker>SHANNON</speaker>

   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She emerges, moves to Wills' door, and waits for the elevator to close. When it does, she hurries back to a table over which hangs a GILDED MIRROR. She takes a LOVELY OLD HAT BOX out of the garbage bag and ditches the bag under the table. Then she quickly checks herself in the glass. She doesn't like what she sees. She pokes at her sopping hair and squeezes it, but it's hopeless. Remembering the time, she hurries back to the door, takes a deep breath, and rings the bell. She waits. And waits. Then she hears footsteps approaching. She realizes she's left the hat box on the table. She rushes over and grabs it, just in time to get back to the door when it OPENS. Olivia, the housekeeper, steps out, wearing her coat and carrying her purse. Her voice is low and gentle --</context>
      <utterance>Thank you.</utterance>
   <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <context>She looks and sees Wills standing, back turned, before a broad set of high windows. City lights glimmer in the distance; beneath them lies the vast gloom of Central Park.</context>
      <utterance>What happened?</utterance>

   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wills turns around. A magnificent figure -- expertly tailored tux, every hair in place, freshly manicured. And then he offers her an amused, reassuring smile --</context>
      <utterance>I know... I'm so sorry... I --</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Flattered, her face brightens --</context>
      <utterance>Charlotte, relax. What's the point of being a beautiful young woman if it isn't to keep your admirers waiting? In fact, you disappoint me: I was looking forward to at least another half hour of suspense.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I could leave and come back.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He walks over to her. Smiling, she sets down the box, unties the ribbon, and gingerly removes the hat. It's sublimely simple and elegant. She looks at him with hope. His face betrays nothing --</context>
      <utterance>Nope, too late. Anyway, I want to see the hat.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>I can't. I'm soaked.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Charlotte, a little confused, carefully sets the hat on her head. She steps to a wall mirror, pulls the veil down, and sets it at the correct angle. Wills appears behind her and shares the reflection. She feels his presence, hears his breathing. They speak in hushed tones --</context>
      <utterance>It's all right.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>

      <context>Charlotte can't believe it. She smiles at his reflection.</context>
      <utterance>I don't know. She was vague. Would you... like to come in her place?</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>

ON THE PERIMETER, FIND TWO RICH WOMEN, 40's, too thin, too lifted, watching Wills and Charlotte waltz. They stand with LISA, 23, unassuming, fair-haired, simply dressed.</context>
      <utterance>Uh-huh. And the next time I saw you, you were on the cover of New York magazine. And I had to pick a place for my birthday. So...</utterance>

      <context>Wills is uncomfortable for a moment, then ventures quietly --</context>
      <utterance>I met Ella in the fourth grade. She was my teacher at the Little Red School House. We stayed friends after she retired. She taught me how to cook and sew... speak Italian... basically enjoy life, have fun -- that's what she was best at... even when she knew she was dying.  The most important thing she did was introduce me to poetry. She believed it was the highest form of art and that everything we say and do should aspire to it.</utterance>

      <utterance>My mom and my dad's. After they died, Dolly was so devastated she pretty much gave up on everything. It was like if something that tragic could happen, there was no way she was ever gonna care about anyone else ever again. Including herself. She wasn't a horrible parent... she didn't abuse me or anything... she just ignored me. She was more like a weird landlady than a grandmother.</utterance>

      <context>Silence as Wills somberly reflects. Finally, he speaks --</context>
      <utterance>For a long time I kinda thought that, too, and I made excuses for her, but now I don't. I was seven years old and I needed her and she wasn't there.</utterance>

      <context>Suddenly, a SWING SONG starts. Wills smiles at the ironic change of mood, then turns to escort Charlotte away --</context>

      <context>Holding his hand, she starts moving to the music. Wills laughs --</context>

      <utterance>I have no idea what to do!</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She flings her wrap onto a chair and keeps dancing. Wills, charmed senseless, finally surrenders. A SEQUENCE BEGINS during which we see WILLS and CHARLOTTE having an inordinately good time. Wills maintains a modicum of reserve; Charlotte is joyful and entirely unembarrassed. CERTAIN GUESTS NOTICE THEM. The reactions to their pairing runs from confusion to disgust to amusement. But no one watches them more carefully than Lisa. Finally, in the middle of a song, Wills and Charlotte make their way off the floor, winded and laughing. Wills heads off to the bar. Charlotte turns around and watches the other dancers. Then we notice Lisa standing next to her. They smile at each other. Lisa offers her a cocktail napkin. Charlotte takes it and wipes off her brow. They speak above the music --</context>
      <utterance>Have fun!</utterance>

      <utterance>That's what they say.  I'm Lisa.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They shake hands. Lisa looks away and sees Wills making his way toward them with two glasses of punch. Coolly covering, Lisa beats a hasty retreat --</context>

   <speaker>LISA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Anyway, I should keep mingling. But it was nice to meet you.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lisa smiles politely and walks away. Wills walks up, watching Lisa melt into the crowd. His brow is furrowed. He's wondering if his eyes have deceived him. He hands Charlotte a punch --</context>

   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You see, Charlotte, the way you know you're getting older is that you start to notice patterns. People start falling into types. Pretty soon you know a person before you've even been introduced. And if it's a woman, before the romance even starts, a whisper in your head tells you exactly what it is and how long it's going to last. And the saddest, the most tedious, part of all is that that little voice is almost always right.  Now, what I like about you -- and I think that's actually what inspired this little lecture -- is that I find you completely unprecedented... and, therefore, wholly unpredictable.</utterance>

      <utterance>I'm a "unique". At least that's what my yoga teacher says. He says there are very few uniques in the world and I'm one of them.</utterance>

   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She rises on tiptoe and puts her mouth just inches from his. Their breathing mingles. Wills seems almost dizzied by it. And then, very slowly, he kisses her. She does not kiss back. Finally, he pulls away, staring blankly, breathing hard, not sure what to say. Charlotte whispers --</context>
      <utterance>Perfect. Now watch very carefully.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She smiles, then kisses him deeply on the mouth. Her arms wrap around his neck.</context>
      <utterance>See? You're a typical.  And for what you just did, most girls my age would slap your face. Or ask to be put in a cab.  Lucky for you, I'm a unique.</utterance>

      <context>Wills jerks to his feet and they shake hands --</context>
      <utterance>Mr. Keane? Dr. Sibley.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you so much for taking the time.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIBLEY</speaker>

      <context>He walks around the desk. Sibley is all business, but his brusqueness masks genuine regret --</context>
      <utterance>It's my job, sir. Please, sit down.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIBLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now, Mr. Keane, on the phone you referred to Charlotte's condition as cancer. That isn't strictly accurate. Neuroblastoma is a soft tissue malignancy, but it isn't cancer -- although it sometimes can be just as aggressive.  It's most common in children. In young adults, the condition is extremely rare. In Charlotte's case, the tumor is located in her chest. It's growing rapidly and has proved resistant to both irradiation and chemotherapy. And because of its proximity to her aorta, surgery is out of the question.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So then what treatment is she getting?</utterance>
   <speaker>SIBLEY</speaker>

      <utterance>At present? Nothing.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIBLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A silence settles between them. Sibley opens a folder on his desk.</context>
      <utterance>Eventually she'll be treated for pain. In the end, surgery could become an option, but her chances of survival would be slim. Right now Charlotte's against it. She's signed a directive forbidding any sort of heroic intervention.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIBLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wills shakes his head and rises from his chair. He turns to the door, then turns back to the doctor --</context>
      <utterance>There's more here if you're interested, but it won't mean much to you.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>

      <utterance>Hey.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He can't help but smile. Encouraged, she moves closer --</context>
      <utterance>Look on the bright side: if I weren't sick, there's no way we could hang out together.  I'm serious. You'd be scared of hurting me and I'd be scared you were just using me for my perfect young body.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The cab comes to a stop in front of her brownstone. She smiles archly, savoring the irony --</context>
      <utterance>And then our friends would say we were just into each other for weird psychological reasons. You know, because I'm looking for a daddy substitute and you're looking for someone you can feel superior to so you won't have to confront how scared you are of real intimacy -- and, of course, they'd be right and eventually we'd break up.  But since I'm so sick it doesn't really matter what deep-seated weirdness has brought us together because there's no way we can possibly screw each other over... or up... because that takes time. And I don't have much left.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wills grimly appreciates the irony.</context>
      <utterance>So considering everything, don't you think we should just sort of chill out, forget I'm sick, and enjoy what we have... right now... no strings... just this... until it ends? 'Cause that's really all I have to offer.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She kisses his cheek and jumps out of the cab. She skips up the steps of the brownstone, then immediately turns around and runs back down to the open window. She leans in and mutters sexily --</context>

   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>

      <context>Wills is shocked. She turns and runs back upstairs. She sticks in the key, then turns and waves at Wills before banging open the door with her hip.</context>

He crosses to her and lays his hands on her hips. He kisses her neck. As their breathing quickens, she begins to unbutton his shirt and pull it free of his pants.

      <context>She exits. As Wills sips the drink, he sits on the leather sofa and continues to glance through his mail. Suddenly, shocked, he stops on a letter. He sets his mug down. He hears Charlotte making noise in the next room. He opens the letter and begins to read. His eyes dart down the page, but he quickly sees that the letter is not friendly. His face shows disappointment. He hears footsteps in the hall. He folds the letter up, slips it back into its envelope, and jams it in his back pocket. Charlotte enters and throws her hands out to her side --</context>
      <utterance>Charlotte made it. I just poured it in the cup.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She stands before him, dressed in a WHITE SPINSTERLY VICTORIAN OUTFIT with braids coiled at her ears. Wills smiles with appreciation --</context>

      <context>Sarah, smiling curiously, heads to the back stairwell. She sees Wills standing there. Watching the kids, his eyes are filled with the same sort of wistful yearning that she noticed at the toy store -- She gives him an affectionate poke in the stomach as she passes by and disappears upstairs. Finally, the boy grabs the apple in his teeth and lifts his soaked head to the cheers of his friends. Then he grabs it out of his mouth and begins taking big bites out of it until he uncovers a SILVER DOLLAR. Wills laughs at the kids' excitement. A moment later a WOMAN'S GLOVED HANDS cover his eyes.</context>

      <utterance>No, the answer to that's pretty obvious. I meant tonight. On the roof.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wills laughs to himself, then glances up and sees the reflection of the driver's amused eyes in the rearview mirror. Wills smiles back at Charlotte --</context>
      <utterance>You're not serious.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Of course not. Why would I want to do something like that?</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's what I was wondering. I thought, "We're so happy he'd have no reason to do it. And if he did do it, he'd at least look guilty, wouldn't he? But he doesn't. He looks more relaxed than before the party started."</utterance>

      <utterance>But then I thought, "He's a womanizer -- that's what they say." Funny word, huh? Sounds like some sorta machine. "And how do you get to be a womanizer? Obviously by sleeping with lots of different women for no good reason and being really good at lying about it."</utterance>

   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She touches her own chest. Her voice trembles slightly --</context>

   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>-- that has made me acutely aware of my heart. Nothing corny -- I mean, literally... I feel every beat. I know how sensitive it is. It reacts to everything. She turns in her seat and lifts an OPEN PALM.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He smiles at her as though he were indulging a child. She looks him deeply in the eye and opens a button of his shirt. She slips her palm inside, over his heart. Still smiling, he doesn't move a muscle. Their eyes are locked. Ever so slowly, her face crumples and tears appear in her eyes. She shakes her head --</context>
      <utterance>If you're lying to me, I'll know it.  Did you have sex with Wendy on the roof?</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLOTTE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She slides away from him, drops her face into her hands, and begins to cry. Wills looks down, then glances up at the rearview mirror. Illuminated in flashes, the driver's eyes have taken on an ominous, unblinking quality as though they were the outward embodiment of his own conscience. Wills looks out the window. When he finally speaks, his voice is calm and a little cold --</context>
      <utterance>My God... oh my God.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yes. Yes, it has. Considerably. As for her loss of consciousness, one explanation is a disturbance in her heart's electrical function. We'll be monitoring her overnight for any arrhythmias. If we find something, we'll treat it. Unfortunately, the more likely explanation is that the tumor has begun to obstruct the outflow of her heart. If that's the case, there's little we can do.

      <utterance>I have no idea. The summer was over. Your mom was going back to Smith. I was moving down here to work on Wall Street. It was our last day together. She was crying. She told me, for the first time, that she loved me. I said I loved her, too. I promised to call and visit. A few hours later I was in a cabana with Millie.  When Millie told me she was pregnant and that she wanted to marry me, I escaped to L.A... and I never saw her or your mom again.</utterance>
