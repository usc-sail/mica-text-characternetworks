      <utterance>That's what we're gonna call it: I Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in selling worm farms you know, like ant farms. A lot of people don't realize that worms make much better pets than ants. They're quiet, affectionate, they don't bite, and they're super with the kids.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Uh... well, sure but they aren't half as affectionate. And if you cut an ant's head off, it won't grow back.</utterance>

      <context>To her credit, she doesn't. They continue driving. Mary looks at her watch and crosses her legs. Lloyd can see that she's concerned about something.</context>
      <utterance>And best of all, worm farming is a seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year industry. I wouldn't mind having a piece of that pie, if you know what I mean.</utterance>
