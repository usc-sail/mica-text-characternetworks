      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. We can still see his hand, holding Jude's. She leans against the canvas, looking bored.</context>

      <utterance>What if I did?</utterance>
   <speaker>JUDE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. Her eyes flick around the carnival. They settle on a tall dark- haired man in a dark jacket. He nods.</context>
      <utterance>You'd know I wouldn't run off.</utterance>
   <speaker>JODY</speaker>

   <speaker>JUDE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jody follows her, as she walks backward, drawing him on. He moves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach, under a train trestle.</context>
      <utterance>People. They could be looking.</utterance>

      <utterance>Come and get me, soldier --</utterance>
   <speaker>JODY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He sinks down on his knees toward her. She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her, fumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward. A shadow falls across them. CLOSE ON JODY, kissing her. A gun is put to his head. He turns around, drunkenly.</context>
      <utterance>Whatever you say, Jude...</utterance>
   <speaker>JODY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The gun whacks him across the cheek and he falls sideways. Jude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a field. Jody feels his cheek. He can see her blond head vanishing among the fields. He looks up and sees a group of men around him. The tallest of them, Fergus, cocks the gun.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>She moves over to him. She prods him in the legs with her foot. He doesn't move. Then she lifts the hood ever so slightly, to peer inside. Suddenly the man moves like lightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off, throwing his body, tied to the chair, over Jude.</context>
      <utterance>Hasn't moved for twelve hours. Go on. Have a heart.</utterance>
   <speaker>JODY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair. He writhes on top of her in a grotesque parody of love. She is screaming and the room is alive, each man awake, grabbing guns, screaming.</context>

Scorpion replies, "It would not be in my interest to sting you since as I'll be on your back we both would drown." Frog thinks about this logic for a while and accepts the deal. Takes the scorpion on his back. Braves the waters. Halfway over feels a burning spear in his side and realizes the scorpion has stung him after all. And as they both sink beneath the waves the frog cries out, "Why did you sting me, Mr. Scorpion, for now we both will drown?" Scorpion replies, "I can't help it, it's in my nature." Jody chuckles under his hood.</utterance>

The gent makes his way, with gout-ridden slowness, across the pavement, through the passersby, toward the car. A burly security man emerging from the car, walking toward the old gent. Fergus reaches the car just before he does, and passes between him and the open door. The old gent's stomach brushes Fergus's elbow.</context>
