      <mode></mode>
      <context>College Boy is rapt.</context>
      <utterance>Last winter, a man kidnapped a little girl and holed up in one of these caves. The cops had him pinned down and began to move in. This guy started shooting... but he wasn't aiming at the officers...  ...he was firing at something inside.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Something GRABS College Boy's ankles, causing him to jump.</context>
      <utterance>When the dust cleared, all they found was the little girl's shoes.  With the feet still in 'em.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLLEGE BOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lanky's on his knees, having grabbed him from behind. The two men mockingly laugh. College boy settles, embarrassed.</context>

   <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As Chief moves forward, pulling out his pick-axe. Instantly, the cave is illuminated by a white floodlight. A group of GREENPEACE HIPPIE ACTIVISTS stand in the cave, CHAINED TOGETHER at the waist, startling the men into screams. MEAN GREEN (35, crooked glasses on a face that has launched a thousand craps) barks into a MINI BULLHORN that hangs around her neck. She charges towards Chief.</context>
      <utterance>Shhhh...</utterance>
   <speaker>MEAN GREEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Panicked, Chief drops his pick-axe and stumbles back.</context>

   <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>In unison, the hippies start CHANTING.</context>

   <speaker>HIPPIE GROUP</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A BEARDED CAMERAMAN with a huge KEY RING on his belt, films the whole event. The three men are stopped in their tracks.</context>

      <utterance>Take it easy! We have a permit!</utterance>
   <speaker>MEAN GREEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Chief, shaken, confirms the injunction and hands it back.</context>
      <utterance>And we have an injunction from the State to prevent any dumping in these caverns! This is virgin land! The aqueducts in these caves bring drinking water to our families, and its piping provides drainage for our farms that enrich this barren land! And it won't be tainted by waste of any kind! Not now! Not ever!</utterance>
   <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He snaps his fingers, motioning to the barrel.</context>

      <context>Hastily, the men roll the barrel out of the cave.</context>
      <utterance>I'll tell ya next time! NOW MOVE IT!</utterance>
   <speaker>MEAN GREEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The hippies let out a spirited cheer. One pulls out a tambourine, drums the beat for KUM BI YA. The rest join in the victorious chant as they watch the three men hop in their truck and peel away.</context>
      <utterance>Score one for the green team!!!</utterance>
   <speaker>BEARDED CAMERAMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>At the end of the human chain, an earthy woman, FUZZY, moves to hang a GREENPEACE sign. Mean Green strokes the cave wall.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, man, that was righteous, but I need a shot with the sign up.</utterance>
   <speaker>MEAN GREEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Fuzzy hammers the sign in, but hits too hard, causing a breach in the rock wall.</context>
      <utterance>We saved you today, ol' gal.</utterance>

      <utterance>Sister, why do you always swing for the fences?</utterance>
   <speaker>FUZZY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>CHOMP! A set of giant, ravenous teeth bite into Fuzzy's skull. Blood SPLATTERS on the hippies. Bearded Cameraman jumps to pull Fuzzy from the breach. Fuzzy's body is YANKED into the hole. The group tumbles forward. Mean Green tries to stop herself from sliding, but can't. One by one, the hippies are being dragged to their death. Ripping, tearing, and howling echoes off the walls. Bearded Cameraman stumbles back. Mean Green spots him.</context>
      <utterance>Oh my, it looks like diamonds!</utterance>
   <speaker>MEAN GREEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bearded Camerman just stares at her in shock. He's missing both his arms. Mean Green lunges and grabs Chief's dropped pick-axe. She HAMMERS at the chain around her waist. Foot by foot, she's dragged closer. At the last second, she BREAKS the chain, popping herself free. She spins, running for safety. A guttural HOWL behind her fills the cavern. Mean Green sprints toward the cave opening. She's gonna make it. Only a few more feet. And then... JERK! Something grabs her neck and YANKS her back into the darkness. The whiplash sends her bloody BULLHORN flying into the light. As it lands, it lets out one last weak HONK...</context>

The darkness covers the manhole. Momma Beast rises, hoisting Adulterer's blood dripping body from the ground.</context>
