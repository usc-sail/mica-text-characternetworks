You do it right and it will take care of you. But I'm through. I'm sorry, Frank, this is the end.  Life is too short, and I'm too old.  Mickey walks out of the office. Slams the door.

He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.</utterance>

As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.  P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years.

      <utterance>It's a terrible thing to sit in judgment. So much rides on it. I know that you've thought, 'How can I be pure. How can I be impartial without being cold. How can I be merciful and still be just?' And I know that most of you have said some sort of prayer this morning to be helped. To judge correctly. We have the reputation of two men. Two well respected doctors and a renowned hospital before us. And with those two respected men we have my client, Deborah Ann Kaye...  ...who was deprived of sight, of locomotion, hearing, speech, of everything, in short, which constitutes her life.  We are going to prove she was deprived through negligence.  Through the negligence of those respected men. We will show: One...</utterance>

      <utterance>In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. THOMPSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.</utterance>
   <speaker>GALVIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these people's time. Answer the question, Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?</utterance>

Mr. White asked me, 'How did you do.'  I said, 'I've done my best.' He said, 'They don't pay you to do your best. They pay you to win.'  That's what pays for this office.  And that's what pays for the pro bono work that we do for the poor. And for the kind of law that you want to practice. And that's what pays for your clothes and my whiskey, and the leisure that we have to sit back and discuss philosophy.  As we're doing tonight.  We're paid to win the case.</utterance>
