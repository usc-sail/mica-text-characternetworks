      <context>Nomak looks up. We get a better look at his face now - he has a thin scar running from his lower lip down his chin. A childhood accident, perhaps. A NURSE smiles and motions for him to join her. She's carrying a clipboard.</context>

      <context>Nomak follows the Nurse to a steel door were TWO SECURITY GUARDS await them. Both look bored, paying little attention to the monitor which offers a view of the examining room beyond. There is also a small window with safety glass. GUARD 1 opens the door, following Nomak and the Nurse inside. GUARD 2 remains behind, manning the hallway.</context>

      <utterance>Us? What are you talking about?</utterance>
   <speaker>DOCTOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jared. Good news for us, bad for you. The Doctor and Nurse smile, BARING FANGS. We realize now that they are both vampires. The Guard, too. He grips Nomak by the throat, forcing him back into the restraint chair. As the vampire Guard does so, his hand brushes against Nomak's jaw. The flesh on Nomak's chin briefly separates along the scar - almost as if it were a seam. The guard pauses - and Nomak LAUGHS. Definitely NOT the reaction the vampires were expecting from a potential victim. Nomak starts to shake and twitch, like he's going into some kind of seizure. The whites of his eyes bleed red. He throws his head back, opening his mouth as a PAIR OF RAZOR SHARP CANINES extrude from his gums. These are longer, much more lethal-looking than the fangs of the vampires and -- Nomak lashes out, knocking the Guard backwards. The Nurse SCREAMS. Nomak clamps his mouth onto her throat, SLAMMING her back against the wall. The vampire Doctor rushes to the door, scrambling to unbolt it. Nomak reaches for him, HOWLING with blood-drunk laughter as he lifts the Doctor up. Nomak flings the Doctor about like a toy, using his body to SMASH the lights, then the security camera above.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Whistler's ace drifts around into view. Blade shakes his head in sadness. He looks about for a way to extract Whistler, doesn't see any obvious means, then -- CRASH! Blade kicks through the glass. Blood and fluids flood out around him as Whistler's limp body tumbles partly down, but he's still suspended by the wires and medical leads. Blade unsheathes his sword, severing the wires -- Whistler falls into his arms. Blade cradles him, then -- the gunsmith's eyes abruptly snap open, flooding with rage. Blade staggers back as the HOWLING horror that used to be his mentor wraps his hands around Blade's throat, forcing him to the ground. Whistler ROARS, revealing a set of jagged fangs.</context>

      <context>Scud is lowering himself down from the ceiling on a rope and pulley system where he'd been suspended in a safety harness, doing some kind of electrical wiring job. He reaches the floor and unclips himself. We notice he's wearing a surfer's charm around his neck that's been strung with vampire fangs. Scud pulls a half-smoked roach from behind his ear, using a lighter in the shape of a woman's torso to fire up. The flame jets from a hole in one of her tits. He takes a Spicoli-sized hit and offers the roach to Blade.</context>

   <speaker>BLADE</speaker>

      <context>Scud steps forward, tentative. Together, he and Blade drag Whistler kicking and SCREAMING across the workshop, forcing him into a small, cell-like room.</context>

      <context>Scud scurries away. Whistler's struggles have taken an even more violent turn. Blade beats him back down. Finally, Blade steps on Whistler's neck, pinning his head as he draws a shotgun from a holster beneath his armpit. He shoves it in Whistler's SNARLING FACE.</context>

      <context>Blade holds up his hand, silencing Scud's outburst. He nods for Nyssa and Asad to continue. Nyssa slowly crouches and reaches for the object she dropped - a CD. She tosses it to Blade. Still keeping an eye on them, Blade slips the CD into a reader. We SEE a slide-show of video capture shots taken from a surveillance camera. Nomak tearing into the blood bank staff, etc.</context>

      <context>As Nyssa talks, one of the viral nucleocapsids changes, mutating from its original, elegant design into a harsher, more menacing form. The mutated nucleocapsid begins feeding on the original vampire capsids, causing a chain-reaction of mutation. In seconds, the holo-image is filled with throbbing, microscopic horrors which then mutate into --</context>

Rounding out the bunch is CHUPA, a blunt featured Puerto Rican, and VERLAINE, a familiar-looking curvaceous beauty with bee-stung lips that exudes a predatory sexuality. (NOTE: Verlaine looks familiar because she is the twin sister of Raquel, the bodacious vamp played by Traci Lords that Blade killed in the opening scene of the first film.)</context>

      <context>Blade does his level best, pulling his MACH, squeezing off a SHOT even as Reinhardt FIRES. BA-BANG! Blade is hit in the side, spun clear around. His shot goes wild, hitting one of the Guards in the head, turning him to ash as Blade himself falls to the floor.</context>
      <utterance>Six-thousand feet per second, isn't that what Whistler said? Let's see you dodge this one --</utterance>

      <context>Blade GASPS in shock. The rail-gun needles have ripped a brutal hole through the side of his chest-plate. He clutches at his flank, trying to staunch the blood that's seeping between his fingers. As he sits forward, we see MORE FLECHETTES have embedded in the wall behind him, having torn completely through him. Whistler steps forward. One of the vampire sentries LASHES OUT, striking him in the face with the butt of his rifle. Whistler sinks to his knees, stunned. The guard disarms him.</context>

      <utterance>And you. You never cared about me. I gave you everything. All you cared about was digging up the old fuck! You think they scoped out my security system?  I let them in. Dude, I practically gave 'em the fucking keys. I've been feeding Damaskinos information the whole time. Providing them with samples of your genetic material -- helping them with the Reaper program. They're close, Blade. Right up against it. Any day now, they're all going to be Daywalkers. And when that happens, well, let's just say, I don't want to be on the losing team. You may be strong, you may be fast, but in the end, you're just too human, B.</utterance>

In seconds, Nomak is gone. Beat. Blade stands, exhausted. Then he looks to where Nyssa rests. He moves to her side, kneeling beside her. She smiles up at him, bravely, but frightened all the same.
