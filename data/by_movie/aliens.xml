      <context>Harsh light floods in as a motorized shield slides into the ceiling, REVEALING a breathtaking vista. Beyond the sprawling complex of modular habitats, collectively called GATEWAY STATION, is the curve of EARTH as seen from high orbit. Blue and serene.</context>

      <utterance>Terrible.</utterance>

      <utterance>Just terrible? That's better than yesterday at least.</utterance>

      <utterance>How long have I been on Gateway station?</utterance>
   <speaker>MED-TECH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ripley shrugs, not caring. The door opens and a MAN enters, although Ripley sees only what he is carrying. A familiar large, orange TOMCAT.</context>
      <utterance>Just a couple of days. Do you feel up to a visitor?</utterance>
   <speaker>RIPLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She grabs the cat like a life preserver.</context>
      <utterance>Jones!</utterance>
   <speaker>RIPLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jones patiently endures Ripley's embarrassing display, seeming none the worse for wear. The visitor sits beside the bed and Ripley finally notices him. He is thirtyish and handsome, in a suit that looks executive or legal, the tie loosened with studied casualness. A smile referred to as "winning."</context>
      <utterance>Come here Jonesy you ugly old moose...you ugly thing.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nice room. I'm Burke. Carter Burke. I work for the company, but other than that I'm an okay guy. Glad to see you're feeling better. I'm told the weakness and disorientation should pass soon. Side effects of the unusually long hypersleep, or something like that.</utterance>
   <speaker>RIPLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How long was I out there? They won't tell me anything.</utterance>
   <speaker>BURKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ripley grabs his arm, surprising him.</context>
      <utterance>Well, maybe you shouldn't worry about that just yet.</utterance>
   <speaker>RIPLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Burke gazes at her, thoughtful.</context>
      <utterance>How long?</utterance>
   <speaker>BURKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ripley is stunned. She seems to deflate, her expression passing through amazement and shock to realization of all she has lost. Friends. Family. Her world.</context>
      <utterance>All right. My instinct says you're strong enough to handle this...Fifty-seven years.</utterance>
   <speaker>RIPLEY</speaker>

      <utterance>Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...</utterance>
   <speaker>BURKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ripley coughs suddenly as if choking and her expression becomes one of dawning horror. Burke hands her a glass of water from the nightstand. She slaps it away. It shatters with a SMASH. Jones dives, yowling. Ripley grabs her chest, struggling as if she is strangling. The Med-Tech hits a console button.</context>
      <utterance>You'd drifted right through the core systems. It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?</utterance>

      <context>WIDER ANGLE as Jones steps back confused from the HIGH-RESOLUTION ENVIRONMENTAL WALL SCREEN, a sort of cinerama video-loop. Ripley sits on a bench in what we now SEE is an ATRIUM off the medical center, still somewhere in the bowels of Gateway Station. Benches. Some unenthusiastic potted trees. The sterile corridors VISIBLE beyond glass doors b.g. Burke ENTERS in his usual mode, casual haste.</context>
      <utterance>Dumbshit.</utterance>
   <speaker>BURKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ripley seems healthier now, but still a bit brittle.</context>

   <speaker>RIPLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is she...?</utterance>
   <speaker>BURKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Amanda Ripley-McClaren. Married name, I guess. Age: sixty-six ...at time of death. Two years ago.  I'm sorry. Ripley studies the PHOTOGRAPH, stunned. The face of a woman in her mid-sixties. It could be anybody. She tries to reconcile the face with the little girl she once knew.</utterance>

      <utterance>Cancer. Hmmmm. They still haven't licked that one. Cremated. Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin. No children. Ripley gazes off, into the pseudo-landscape, into the past.</utterance>
   <speaker>RIPLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Burke nods, a simpatico presence.</context>
      <utterance>I promised her I'd be home for her birthday. Her eleventh birthday. I sure missed that one.  Well...she has already learned to take my promises with a grain of salt. When it came to flight schedules, anyway.</utterance>
   <speaker>RIPLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Let's get one thing straight...Ripley can be one tough lady. But the terror, the loss, the emptiness are, in this moment, overwhelming. She cries silently. Burke puts a reassuring hand on her arm.</context>
      <utterance>You always think you can make it up to somebody...later, you know. But now I never can. I never can.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>She faces the EIGHT MEMBERS of the board of inquiry at a long conference table. Gray suits and grim faces. They aren't buying. Behind Ripley on a large VIDEO SCREEN, PARKER grins like a goon from his personnel mugshot. His file prints out next to it. BRETT's face and dossier replace it, and then the others as the SCENE continues... KANE, LAMBERT, ASH the android traitor, DALLAS. VAN LEUWEN, the ICC representative, steeples his fingers and frowns.</context>
      <utterance>Do you people have earwax, of what? We have been here three hours. How many different ways do you want me to tell the same story?</utterance>
   <speaker>VAN LEUWEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look at it from our perspective. You freely admit to detonating the engines of, and thereby destroying, an M-Class star-freighter. A rather expensive piece of hardware...</utterance>
   <speaker>INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>That's minus payload, of course.</context>
      <utterance>Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The shuttle's flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account. That the Nostromo set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed planet, at that time. That repairs were made. That it resumed its course and was subsequently set for self-destruct. By you. For reasons unknown.</utterance>
   <speaker>RIPLEY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look, I told you...</utterance>

      <utterance>It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>The ECA (Extrasolar Colonization Administration) Representative (ECA REP) just shakes his head.</context>
      <utterance>Then somebody's gotten to it... doctored the recorder. Who had access to it?</utterance>
   <speaker>ECA REP</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ripley glares at the ECA Rep, a woman on the ungenerous side of fifty. Van Leuwen sighs with exasperation.</context>

   <speaker>ECA REP</speaker>

      <context>Ripley grits her teeth in frustration.</context>
      <utterance>No. It's a rock. No indigenous life larger than a simple virus.</utterance>
   <speaker>RIPLEY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I told you, it wasn't indigenous. There was an alien spacecraft there. A derelict ship. We homed on its beacon...</utterance>
   <speaker>ECA REP</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ripley glances at Burke, silent at the far end of the table. His expression is grim. Her mouth hardens as a bit of the old nail-eating Ripley surfaces.</context>
      <utterance>To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed over three hundred worlds and no one's ever reported a creature which, using your words...  ...'gestates in a living human host' and has 'concentrated molecular acid for blood.'</utterance>
   <speaker>RIPLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look, I can see where this is going. But I'm telling you those things exist. Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs. Thousands. Do you understand? I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data. Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...</utterance>

      <context>Ripley turns sharply away, trembling with frustration and anger. Dallas looks back at her from the video screen, his eyes burning from the photograph, as we:</context>
      <utterance>That's not all, Goddamnit! If those things get back here, that will be all. Then you can just kiss it good-bye, Jack! Just kiss it goodbye.</utterance>

Ripley pushes the hatch open before the child can latch it, and crawls in after her. Newt is backed into a cul-de-sac in the tiny steel chamber. Ripley shines her light around in amazement. It is a NEST. A nest built by a child. Wadded up blankets and pillows line the space, mixed up with a haphazard array of TOYS, STUFFED ANIMALS, DOLLS, CHEAP JEWELRY, COMIC BOOKS, EMPTY FOOD PACKETS, even a battery operated TAPE PLAYER. All foraged from the wrecked colony. Ripley marvels at the child's incredible adaptability, the ability to functions even in this nightmarish environment. Newt edges along the far wall and dives for the hatch. Ripley grabs her, controlling her in a bear hug. The kid struggles wildly, like a cat at the vets. Eyes wide, hands lashing out in a frenzy...but silent. No scream.</context>

Macabre image of frozen agony. Many are disiccated. Skeletal. Rip-cages burst outward, as if exploded from within. Paralyzed, brought here, entombed in living death as hosts for the embryos growing within then. Dietrich moves close to examine one of the figures, perhaps the most "recent."

THEY OPEN AGAIN, an automatic safety feature. THE WARRIOR HISSES, LUNGING. Hicks FIRES, POINT-BLANK. It spins away, SCREECHING. Acid sluices between the closing doors, across Hicks' armored chest plate, as he shields Ripley with his body. The lift starts upward. Hicks' fingers race with the clasps as the stuff eats its way toward his skin. Galvanized out of her hysteria, Ripley claws at his armor, helping him as much as she can. He screams as the acid contacts his chest and arm. He shucks out of the combat armor like a madman, dropping the smoking pieces to the floor. Acrid fumes fill the air, searing eyes and lungs.

She fires the flamethrower. The eggs are engulfed. One of the warriors lunges forward, a living fireball. She blasts it in half with two bursts from the M-41A. Ripley retreats, ducking under a glistening cylindrical mass. A PIERCING SHRIEK fill the chamber. She turns. And there it is. A massive silhouette in the mist, the ALIEN QUEEN glowers over her eggs like a great, glistening black insect-Buddha. What's bigger and meaner than the Alien? His momma. Her fanged head is an unimaginable horror. Her six limbs, the four arms and two powerful legs, are folded grotesquely over her distended abdomen. The egg-filled abdomen swells and swells into a great pulsing tubular sac, suspended from a lattice of pipes and conduits by a weblike membrane as if some vast coil of intestine were draped carelessly among the machinery. Ripley realizes she ducked under part of it a moment before. Inside the abdominal sac can be SEEN the forms of countless eggs, churning their way toward the pulsating ovipositor where they emerge glistening, to be picked up by DRONES. The drones are tiny scuttling albino versions of the "warrior" aliens we have already seen. Ripley pumps the slide on her grenade launcher. She fires. Pumps and fires again. Four times. The grenades punch deep into the egg sac and EXPLODE, ripping it open from within. Eggs are tons of gelatinous matter pour across the chamber floor. The Queen goes berserk, SCREECHING like some psychotic steam whistle. Ripley lays about her with the flamethrower, igniting everything in sight with an insane fury. Eggs shrivel in the inferno, and figures of warriors and drones vanish in frenzied thrashing. Over all is the Queen's shrieking as she struggles in the flames. Two warriors emerge from the boiling smoke, closing on her. She pulls the trigger...an empty click. DIGITAL COUNTER flashing crimson zeroes. She drops the magazine, grabs another from her belt, rams it home and OPENS UP. The creatures vanish in rapid-fire flashes. Ripley backs away, venting her terror in a sustained orgy of fire as she blasts everything that moves in one long eye-searing expenditure of energy.

Bishop thrashes, seizing the protruding section of tail in his hands, as is slowly lifts him off the deck. Above them the Queen glowers from its place of concealment among the hydraulic mechanisms inside one landing-leg bay. It blends perfectly with the machinery until it begins to emerge. Seizing Bishop in two great hands it rips him apart and flings him aside, shredded, like a doll. It descends slowly to the deck, the rotating lights glistening across its shiny black limbs, dripping acid and rage. Still smoking where Ripley half-fried it. The Queen is huge, powerful...and very pissed off. It descends slowly, its six limbs unfolding in inhuman geometries.
