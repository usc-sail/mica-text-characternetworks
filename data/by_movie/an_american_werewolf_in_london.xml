      <context></context>
      <utterance>Here, lads, East Proctor and all about are the moors. I go east here.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, well thank you very much for the ride, sir. You have lovely sheep.</utterance>
   <speaker>TRUCK DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Boys, keep off the moors. Stay on the road. Good luck to you.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He drives off. LONG SHOT of the two boys as the lorry pulls away. Surrounding them are the moors. They put on their packs, David points to the signpost pointing towards East Proctor.</context>
      <utterance>Thanks again!</utterance>

      <utterance>You're not having a good time are you?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The camera shows us the moors - desolate, cold, foreboding.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I like it here.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They walk on.</context>
      <utterance>Right.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She's a jerk.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're talking about the woman I love.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>

      <utterance>I don't know.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared....</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>David just laughs and laughs and laughs.</context>
      <utterance>She says she `likes me too much'.</utterance>

      <utterance>He was joking. Thank you.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jack and David look startled. One of the CHESS PLAYERS explains:</context>
      <utterance>Joking? I remember The Alamo. I saw it once in London, in Leicester Square.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHESS PLAYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She means in the cinema, that film with John Wayne.  Checkmate.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, yes, of course.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Right, with Laurence Harvey and everybody died in it. It was very bloody.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHESS PLAYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This sends everyone into gales of laughter. Jack and David smile politely.</context>
      <utterance>Bloody awful if you ask me!</utterance>
   <speaker>CHESS PLAYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Laughter.</context>
      <utterance>No, but we're about to.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHESS PLAYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, come on, tell us.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHESS PLAYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The men all coax him to tell the joke.</context>
      <utterance>No. You've had your chance.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ask them what the candles are for.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You ask them.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Listen, that's a pentangle, a five-pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Right.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the joke as everyone knew he would.</context>
      <utterance>Wrong.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHESS PLAYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Uproarious laughter.</context>
      <utterance>That's very funny, that is.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Go on, ask them.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You ask them.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHESS PLAYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Here now, let me finish! So halfway over the ocean the engines run low on petrol so they have to lighten the plane. So they heave out all the baggage, but it's still too heavy. So they chuck out the seats, but it's still too heavy! Finally this Froggy steps up and shouts "Viva la France" and leaps out. Then an Englishman....</utterance>
   <speaker>DART PLAYERS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hear! Hear!</utterance>
   <speaker>CHESS PLAYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...steps up and shouts `God save the Queen!' and leaps out. But the plane is still too heavy. So the Yank delegate from Texas steps up, shouts, `Remember the Alamo!' and chucks out the Mexican. This is apparently the funniest joke the inhabitants of East Proctor have ever heard. The laughter is uproarious, choking, knee-slapping, incredible. As the Chess Player goes to take a drink of beer, the Dart Player gasps out...</utterance>
   <speaker>DART PLAYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>...causing the Chess Player to spit out his beer causing even harder laughter. Complete hilarity.</context>
      <utterance>Remember the Alamo!</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dead silence. A dart lands in the wall. David and Jack are understandably bewildered. The villagers look hard indeed.</context>
      <utterance>Excuse me, but what's that star on the wall for?</utterance>
   <speaker>DART PLAYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You've made me miss.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>

      <utterance>I'm sorry.</utterance>
   <speaker>DART PLAYER</speaker>

   <speaker>JACK</speaker>

      <utterance>What do you mean? I'm starving.</utterance>
   <speaker>DART PLAYER</speaker>

      <utterance>Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly for the door.</context>
      <utterance>Apparently so.</utterance>

      <context>Keep clear of the moors.</context>
      <utterance>Go! And stay on the road.</utterance>

      <context>A growl. A low guttural growl comes from out of the darkness. We stay on the boys, but we hear something out there. It starts to walk.</context>

      <utterance>It's moving.</utterance>

      <utterance>Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd....</utterance>

      <context>David looks over to the o.s. Jack. Jack, behaving relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by Alex. However, Jack's appearance makes his casual manner all the more surreal. He is as we left him butchered on the moors. He is covered with dried mud and open wounds. Huge glistening gashes abound on his body. His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn, and his hair is matted with blood. In several spots he has already begun to rot. He is a remarkably gruesome sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him at all.</context>

      <utterance>Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. HIRSCH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've `misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. HIRSCH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.</utterance>

   <speaker>DR. HIRSCH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Alex is flabbergasted.</context>
      <utterance>I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. HIRSCH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You've absolutely no idea where David might be?</utterance>
   <speaker>ALEX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly.</context>
      <utterance>No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.</utterance>

   <speaker>DR. HIRSCH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?</utterance>
