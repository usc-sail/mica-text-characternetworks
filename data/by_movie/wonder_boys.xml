      <context>big lips is depressed because, each night, when her father goes off to work at the bakery, her mother sneaks some mysterious lover into the house. Not only does this girl have to listen to her mother working this guy in the next room, she has to wash the sheets each morning before Daddy gets home. After a few weeks of this, she starts to go a little nutty/ so Daddy takes her to confession--only, once she gets in the box, she gets a whiff of the priest and realizes he's the mother's secret lover. Is that it? James Leer says nothing, huddling lower in the PATTY OVERCOAT he wears.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>All right. Let's try to keep it constructive, shall we? Howard, what about you?</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I hated it.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRADY</speaker>

      <utterance>That's not exactly what I meant by constructive, Howard.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>constructive. This is my second semester with him. His stories are brutal, man. They make me want to kill myself. GRADY glances at James, but his face remains impassive. Then--with a visible sense of relief--GRADY notices the raised hand of the achingly beautiful HANNAH GREEN.</context>
      <utterance>I think James should try to be more</utterance>
   <speaker>GRADY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, Hannah?</utterance>
   <speaker>HANNAH GREEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes . . . courage . GRADY nods, smiles subtly. Appreciative.</context>
      <utterance>I think maybe we're missing the point. It</utterance>
   <speaker>GRADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well put, Hannah. And a good note to end on, I think.  Don't forget about WordFest this weekend. And remember: those of you driving V.I.P.s to tonight's cocktail party need to have them at the Chancellor's house no later than 5:30. Hannah Green gathers her things, pauses by Grady.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thanks for that. He all right?</utterance>
   <speaker>HANNAH GREEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I think so. ..What about you?</utterance>

      <utterance>Me? Sure. Why?</utterance>

      <context>GRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back of the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on the wail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK.</context>

      <utterance>And while my latest has been on the New York Times bestseller list for 40 weeks, I can't help but lament that my first book, which contains what I consider my finest writing, was remaindered in less than five. So, I find myself conflicted.</utterance>

      <context>GRADY starts, but when he looks through the window, he sees that the VOICE belongs to WALTER GASKELL and the person to whom he's talking is Sara. They are standing in the kitchen, near an elaborate WINE RACK.</context>

      <context>As Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in the quiet little room, looking small and tired. Finally, she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off, returning to the clamor inside her house. GRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond. A FIGURE is watching him from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's garage. GRADY blinks, chagrined that he's been caught eavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the porch.</context>

      <context>James' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and GRADY peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand. The sliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny PEARL-HANDLED</context>

Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick?

      <utterance>Good evening.</utterance>
   <speaker>Q</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As the audience EXPLODES with glee, GRADY frowns. He glances to his right, sees James' left brow crinkled with a similar look of bafflement. Q (cont'd) As a writer, one thing you learn is that everyone you encounter has a story. Every bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an idea or a. story that would make a "great book" or a "great movie." Presumably, each of you has an idea. (gestures to the audience) But, how do you go from there to here? How do you go from having an idea to having a book? How do you get across? What is the bridge, the bridge that allows you to walk on air from the shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of accomplishment? Faith. Faith that your story is worth the telling, faith that you have the wherewithal to tell it, faith that the carefully woven structure you create won't collapse beneath you... GRADY glances at James, sees that his eyes are unblinking and glazed, then sees, beyond him, Sara standing by the far EXIT. A blink later, she is gone. Q (cont'd) ...and faith that when you get to the other side someone will be waiting who gives a damn about the tale you have to tell. GRADY leans back, listening to the BEATING of his own HEART, the soft GLIMMER of the chandeliers hanging by a thread forty feet above his head... Abruptly, James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement: bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the auditorium. As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn, James ducks down--mortified. Crabtree, sitting a few rows away, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady. GRADY blinks, turns to James.</context>
