      <utterance>I've written the number of the restaurant on the notepad by the phone.  Zip me up, will you please?  If we aren't home in two hours, it means we've decided to go on to a movie and won't be back until after midnight. Is that all right?</utterance>

      <utterance>Prabably. I'm going to the library in a few minutes. I just have to get out of this house!  Hey! Why don't Billy and I come over there? He'll come along if I tell him to.</utterance>

      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You know what your problem is, Jill, is you're so straight. I really mean that. You go to a private school, you wear a bra. No one can have a good time with you!  You know, Billy asked me to go out with him this weekend, and I was really really tempted because I like Billy... a lot... as much as you do. But I told him I couldn't, that I didn't think it was right because you were my friend --</utterance>

      <utterance>Listen, just give Billy the number here, but don't tell him I told you to. Okay?</utterance>

      <utterance>Let's get something straight here, Doctor. I've been 33 years in the business of tracking people down and putting them away. I spent almost a year on Curt Duncan alone, with the trial, the testimonies, the background investigations. I didn't come here today to look in your goddamn folders. In fact, I wouldn't have come here at all if you'd done your job right.</utterance>

      <utterance>Mr. Clifford, this is a hospital, not a penitentiary. Everything that pertains to one of our patients is meticulously recorded in that patient's folder... whether you can make sense of it or not.</utterance>
   <speaker>DR. MONK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Curt Duncan is a classic paranoid- schizophrenic. They see themselves as victims, and they always blame other people for the way they are. When Duncan killed the Mandrakis kids, it wasn't an act of hostility against the children but against their parents. He was getting back at his own parents for traumas he suffered in early childhood. The criminal side of Curt Duncan is one of terrible, symbolic vengeance.</utterance>

      <context>Monk looks back out the window.</context>
      <utterance>I think you'll find him. Somebody will find him. He can't function out there. He'll make a mistake.  This is where he belongs. After six years in here, he's suddenly gone out to confront the world again. I think he's in for a bit of a shock.</utterance>

      <context>The bartender steps back, deciding to mind his own business. Tracy gets up from her seat and cautiously moves even further down the bar.</context>
      <utterance>No! I want him out of here!</utterance>
   <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They glare at each other. The longer Duncan sits there without moving, without saying anything, the angrier Bill gets.</context>

      <utterance>As the tension builds.</utterance>
   <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Duncan reaches for his drink, but Bill reacts quicker. With a swipe of his hand, he knocks the glass off the bar, and it shatters on the floor behind the bar. Duncan sits there, stunned, not looking up. After a long moment, Duncan coughs. Then he turns and looks at Bill. He purses his lips. It looks like a nervous facial movement. Then suddenly, Duncan spits at Bill, hitting him square in the face. Before anyone can register what's happened, Bill lunges at Duncan, knocking him clean off the barstool and onto the floor. The fight is fast, vicious and one-sided from the very start. Pinned to the floor on his back, Duncan flails his arms ineffectually like a panicked insect as Bill holds him in place with a left-handed grip on the collar while his powerful right arm, pumping up and down like a piston, pounds into Duncan's face time and time again. Duncan's screams diminish into pathetic, sickening groans and the others in the bar are compelled to avert their eyes from this brutal spectacle. Hank has picked up a phone from beneath the bar and is dialing a number. He turns away from the fight to talk. Then, as suddenly as Bill first sprang at Duncan, he leaps to his feet and turns to the bar. He reaches over and grabs the phone from Hank, slamming it down into the cradle.</context>
      <utterance>I'm not going to say it again, mister.</utterance>
   <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bill takes the cloth from the bar and vigorously wipes his face off. He snaps his fingers and points to a row of bottles on a shelf behind the bar. Hank quickly hands him a bottle. Bill pours himself a shot and downs it, fast. He is still charged with adrenaline and he takes two more shots in rapid succession, spilling the alcohol on the bar and on himself. As Bill picks up the cloth to wipe himself off again, Tracy stands up and quickly walks out of the bar, slamming the door behind her.</context>
      <utterance>Who're you calling?</utterance>
   <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Then he throws down the cloth, picks up the bottle, turns and, standing over Duncan's inert form, empties half the bottle onto him. He sets the bottle back on the bar. He grabs Duncan and, half dragging, hurries him out the back door and throws him into the alley where Duncan falls in a heap. Bill storms back up to the bar and pours himself another drink.</context>
      <utterance>You're welcome, baby!</utterance>
   <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hank just looks at him, doesn't answer. At the wife's silent insistence, the elderly couple stand up to go.</context>

   <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He turns and strides out of the bar. CAMERA HOLDS for a beat on Hank alone now in his empty establishment. The phone starts to ring, presumably the police calling back. After several rings, Hank picks up the phone and listens.</context>

      <utterance>He's escaped from the insane asylum. In 1972, he murdered two children... broke into a house and found them asleep in bed. It was a little boy, five an a half, and a little three- year-old girl. After the coroner's investigation, their bodies were taken to the mortuary, where the undertaker took one look at them and said he couldn't have their bodies reconstructed for the funeral without six days of steady work. Then he asked what had been the murder weapon, because looking at the mess in front of him, he couldn't imagine what had been used. The coroner told him there had been no murder weapon. The killer had used only his hands.  The undertaker went to work and had them done in four.</utterance>

   <speaker>CAROL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Everything's fine. Why? What's --?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Long pause. They wait for her answer. Jill is listening into the receiver now, too.</context>
      <utterance>Carol, listen to me very carefully. If there's a man in the house, if there's any reason why you can't talk to me right now, just answer yes to me over the phone. That's all. If there's any danger of any kind, just say yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAROL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jill is confused. John breathes a guarded sigh of relief. Jill takes the phone.</context>
      <utterance>I don't understand what's happening. What man in the house?</utterance>
   <speaker>JILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Carol, it's Mrs. Lockhart. Answer me truthfully. When was the last time you looked in on the children?</utterance>
   <speaker>CAROL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jill gives her husband a look. John takes the phone again.</context>
      <utterance>About forty-five minutes ago. Everything's fine. They were fast asleep.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Carol, I'm sorry about all the hysterics. We're leaving the restaurant now. We'll explain everything when we get home. Before we hang up, could you do just one more thing for me, please?</utterance>
   <speaker>CAROL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jill is violently shaking her head. John silences her with a gesture.</context>
      <utterance>Would you go upstairs and, and check on the children for me?</utterance>
   <speaker>CAROL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Carol O.S. puts the phone down. Then there is silence on the other end. The crowd of people around Jill and John begin to shuffle and murmur. John tries to keep them quiet while listening into the phone. Then TWO POLICEMEN come forward through the crowd. One of them kneels down to John and Jill who are still on the floor.</context>
      <utterance>Sure. Hold on.</utterance>

Duncan, the hideous and terrifying sound of his madness grumbling out of his throat, manages to grab the back of her nightgown. As Jill struggles to get off the bed, the gown rips slightly while she fights to get away. Duncan rolls to her side of the bed and manages to grab Jill's ankle while letting go of the gown. It causes Jill to lose her balance and tumble onto the floor just short of the doorway leading out of the room. Duncan is on her in a flash, clutching at her and moving his hands for her throat. Jill screams again. It is the desperate sound of a woman facing certain death. Suddenly, two quick shots ring out, overwhelming all other sound. Duncan falls back with a groan and a thud. Out of the darkness of the hallway steps Clifford, pistol in hand. He crosses to Duncan. He is dead. Then Clifford walks around the room to the far side of the bed and looks down. On the narrow strip of floor between the bed and the wall lies John. Clifford nudges the body with his foot. John stirs, as if he has been knocked unconscious, but it will be some time yet before he comes to. Clifford starts to walk out of the room, stepping over Duncan's body, edging past Jill who is propped up in the doorway, sobbing hysterically.</context>
