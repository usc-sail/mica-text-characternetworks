      <utterance>Is John not yet arrived?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MR DASHWOOD looks anguished.</context>
      <utterance>We expect him at any moment, dearest.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The girls--I have left so little.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Shh, hush, Henry.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They smile at each other. MRS DASHWOOD is just managing to conceal her fear and grief</context>
      <utterance>Elinor will try to look after you all, but make sure she finds a good husband. The men are such noodles hereabouts, little wonder none has pleased her.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But Marianne is sure to find her storybook hero.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>A romantic poet with flashing eyes and empty pockets?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>As long as she loves him, whoever he is.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MRS DASHWOOD tries to laugh but it emerges as a sob. An older MANSERVANT (THOMAS) now enters, anxiety written on every feature.</context>
      <utterance>Margaret will go to sea and become a pirate so we need not concern ourselves with her.</utterance>
   <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MR DASHWOOD squeezes his wife's hand.</context>
      <utterance>Your son is arrived from London, sir.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She nods quickly and he smiles at her with infinite tenderness.</context>
      <utterance>Let me speak to John alone.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MRS DASHWOOD makes a superhuman effort and smiles back. She allows THOMAS to help her out. She passes JOHN DASHWOOD as he enters, presses his hand, but cannot speak. JOHN takes her place by the bed.</context>
      <utterance>Ah, my dear. How happy you have made me.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MR DASHWOOD summons his last ounces of energy and starts to whisper with desperate intensity.</context>
      <utterance>Father...</utterance>
   <speaker>MR DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JOHN blinks. He cannot quite take it in.</context>
      <utterance>John you will find out soon enough from my will that the estate of Norland was left to me in such a way as prevents me from dividing it between my families.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But MR DASHWOOD continues with even greater determination.</context>
      <utterance>Calm yourself, Father. This is not good for you.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JOHN looks torn between genuine distress and unexpected delight.</context>
      <utterance>Norland in its entirety is therefore yours by law and I am happy for you and Fanny.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JOHN's face is a picture of conflicting emotions. Behind them is the ominous rustling of parchments.</context>
      <utterance>But your stepmother my wife and daughters are left with only five hundred pounds a year, barely enough to live on and nothing for the girls' dowries. You must help them.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Of course</utterance>
   <speaker>MR DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A brief moment of sincerity overcomes JOHN's natural hypocrisy.</context>
      <utterance>You must promise to do this.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MR DASHWOOD seems relieved. Suddenly his breathing changes. JOHN looks alarmed. He rises and we hear him going to find the DOCTOR.</context>
      <utterance>I promise, Father, I promise.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But it is we who share the dying man's last words.</context>
      <utterance>Come! Come quickly!</utterance>

      <context>FANNY goes very still. JOHN gets nervous.</context>
      <utterance>Dearest, I mean to give them three thousand pounds.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>FANNY slowly turns back to the mirror.</context>
      <utterance>The interest will provide them with a little extra income. Such a gift will certainly discharge my promise to my father.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, without question! More than amply...</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A pause as FANNY turns and looks at him again.</context>
      <utterance>One had rather, on such occasions, do too much than too little.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Of course, he did not stipulate a particular sum.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>She suddenly collapses into a chair and bursts into tears.</context>
      <utterance>John and Fanny will descend from London at any moment, followed no doubt by cartloads of relatives ready to turn us out of our rooms one by one do you expect me to be here to welcome them? Vultures!</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I shall start making inquiries for a new house at once. Until then we must try to bear their coming.</utterance>

      <context>MARIANNE stops, turns the pages of her music book and starts playing something equally lugubrious.</context>
      <utterance>Marianne, cannot you play something else? Mamma has been weeping since breakfast.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He displays some coins in his hand. FANNY removes one and nods.</context>
      <utterance>A hundred pounds a year to their mother while she lives. Would that be more advisable? It is better than parting with the fifteen hundred all at once.</utterance>
   <speaker>FANNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JOHN gives the coins to the LANDLORD.</context>
      <utterance>But if she should live longer than fifteen years we would be completely taken in. People always live forever when there is an annuity to be paid them.</utterance>

      <context>A pause. ELINOR is about to leave when a disembodied and truculent young voice stops her.</context>
      <utterance>Margaret, are you there? Please come down. John and Fanny will be here soon.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why are they coming to live at Norland? They already have a house in London.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Silence. ELINOR tries another tack.</context>
      <utterance>Because houses go from father to son, dearest not from father to daughter. It is the law.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If you come inside, we could play with your atlas.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>CLOSE on ELINOR as she ponders the truth of this statement.</context>
      <utterance>It's not my atlas any more. It's their atlas.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Twenty pounds now and then will amply discharge my promise, you are quite right.</utterance>
   <speaker>FANNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Indeed. Although to say the truth, I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them money.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They will have five hundred a year amongst them as it is--</utterance>
   <speaker>FANNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>--and what on earth can four women want for more than that? Their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage, no horses, hardly any servants and will keep no company. Only conceive how comfortable they will be!</utterance>

   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We are very sorry to have to leave you all. But we are certain you will find the new Mrs Dashwood a fair and generous mistress.</utterance>

   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So we are agreed. No money but the occasional gift of game and fish in season will be very welcome.</utterance>

      <context>In the brief silence which follows this, FANNY surreptitiously checks the hallmark on her butterknife.</context>
      <utterance>My mother is always in excellent health, thank you. My brother Robert is in town with her this season and quite the most popular bachelor in London! He has his own barouche.</utterance>

      <utterance>Fortunate girl. At least she can escape Fanny, which is more than any of us is able.</utterance>

And my dear Mrs Dashwood, in view of the fact that he will not be with us for long, I wondered if Miss Margaret would mind giving up her room to him the view is quite incomparable from her windows and I should so much like Edward to see Norland at its best.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Forgive us, Mr Ferrars. My youngest is not to be found this morning. She is a little shy of strangers at present.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Naturally. I am also shy of strangers and I have nothing like her excuse.</utterance>

      <context>As they speak, EDWARD notices a large atlas retreating apparently all by itself across the floor. Someone is obviously under the table, pulling it out of sight. He registers it and immediately moves in such a way as to shield it from FANNY. He turns back, searching for something to divert her.</context>
      <utterance>Oh? No. The dust, perhaps.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I hear you have great plans for the walnut grove.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>There is a stifled wail from under the table, which EDWARD covers with a cough.</context>
      <utterance>Oh yes! I shall have it pulled down to make room for a Grecian temple.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD are puzzled by his elliptical manner but ELINOR immediately understands and rises, in smiling relief.</context>

      <context>They are having such a good time that it is rather a pity the game is stopped by the appearance from under the table of MARGARET who reveals herself to be a disheveled girl of eleven. She hauls the atlas up and plonks it in front of</context>

      <utterance>'Dear Mrs Dashwood, Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne and Captain Margaret-- it gives me great pleasure to restore this atlas to its rightful owner. Alas, business in London does not permit me to accompany it, although this is likely to hurt me far more than it hurts you.

      <utterance>Our gratitude, Mr Willoughby, is beyond expression--</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLOUGHBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He is merry, spirited, voluble--a breath of fresh air. ELINOR brings back WILLOUGHBY's flowers and places them next to BRANDON's on the side table.</context>
      <utterance>But it is I who am grateful. I have often passed this cottage and grieved for its lonely state--and then the first news I had from Lady Allen when I arrived was that it was taken. I felt a peculiar interest in the event which nothing can account for but my present delight in meeting you.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She indicates a chair but WILLOUGHBY sees a book lying on MARIANNE's footstool, picks it up and--to her great delight-- sits down on the stool at her feet.</context>
      <utterance>Pray sit down, Mr Willoughby.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLOUGHBY</speaker>

   <speaker>WILLOUGHBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>It is a general question but MARIANNE gaily commandeers it.</context>
      <utterance>Which are your favourites?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Without a doubt, mine is 116.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove--then how does it go?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>WILLOUGHBY joins in the line halfway through and continues. ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD exchange glances. Clearly, their contribution to this conversation will be minimal.</context>
      <utterance>'0, no! it is an ever-fixed mark.'</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLOUGHBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>'That looks on storms'--or is it tempests? Let me find it. WILLOUGHBY gets out a tiny leatherbound book.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLOUGHBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>It is a miniature copy of the sonnets. MARIANNE is delighted, and, mutually astonished at this piece of synchronicity, they proceed to look up other favourites, chatting as though they were already intimates. MRS DASHWOOD smiles at ELINOR with satisfaction. ELINOR, amused, picks up her sewing. MARGARET stares. WILLOUGHBY and MARIANNE are oblivious to everything but each other.</context>
      <utterance>It is strange you should be reading them--for, look, I carry this with me always.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Good work, Marianne! You have covered all forms of poetry; another meeting will ascertain his views on nature and romantic attachments and then you will have nothing left to talk about and the acquaintanceship will be over.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I suppose I have erred against decorum. I should have been dull and spiritless and talked only of the weather, or the state of the roads.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>No particular reason, Marianne, only that we know so little of him--</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But time alone does not determine intimacy. Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others.</utterance>

ELINOR looks over to the lovers and sees WILLOUGHBY in the act of cutting off a lock of MARIANNE's hair, which he kisses and places in his pocket-book. ELINOR is transfixed by this strangely erotic moment. WILLOUGHBY senses her gaze and looks over. She snaps her head back to her sums and is astonished to find that she has written 'Edward' at the top of the sheet. Hastily she rubs it out and writes 'Expenses'.</context>

      <utterance>I come to issue an invitation. A picnic on my estate at Delaford--if you would care to join us on Thursday next. Mrs Jennings's daughter and her husband are traveling up especially.</utterance>

      <utterance>I know Mr Willoughby extremely well-- not that I ever spoke to him but I have seen him forever in town. Your sister is monstrous lucky to get him.

   <speaker>WILLOUGHBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>WILLOUGHBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>MRS DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That is unlikely. Perhaps this--Lady Allen--disapproves of his regard for Marianne and has invented an excuse to send him away?</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then why did he not say as much? It is not like Willoughby to be secretive. Did he think Marianne was richer than she is?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS DASHWOOD</speaker>

      <context>She gestures to the room and then looks at ELINOR with a frown.</context>

   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I can hardly tell you. But why was his manner so guilty?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MRS DASHWOOD is getting defensive. ELINOR pauses to think.</context>
      <utterance>What are you saying, Elinor? That he has been acting a part to your sister for all this time?</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, he loves her, I am sure.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Of course he loves her!</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But has he left her with any assurance of his return? Cannot you ask her if he has proposed?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Certainly not. I cannot force a confidence from Marianne and nor must you. We must trust her to confide in us in her own time.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>There was something so underhand in the manner of his leaving.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS DASHWOOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You are resolved, then, to think the worst of him.</utterance>

   <speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ELINOR takes the cup and MARGARET runs out into the garden in tears. The sound of sobbing also comes from MARIANNE's room, and now from MRS DASHWOOD's as well. ELINOR sits down helplessly on the stairs and drinks the tea.</context>
      <utterance>She would not let me in.</utterance>

      <context>She sniffs and produces a large handkerchief which she holds to her eyes so that the monogram is clearly visible. ECF. ELINOR, seeing the copy of the handkerchief she has held so dear, moves quickly to a chair and sits down.</context>
      <utterance>I was very unwilling to enter into it without his mother's approval but we loved each other with too great a passion for prudence. Though you do nor know him so well as I, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen how capable he is of making a woman sincerely attached to him. I cannot pretend it has not been very hard on us both.

      <utterance>Poor thing! She looks very bad. No wonder, Miss Dashwood, for it is but too true. I was told here in the street by Miss Morton, who is a great friend: he is to be married at the end of the month--to a Miss Grey with fifty thousand pounds. Well, said I, if 'tis true, then he is a good-for-nothing who has used my young friend abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul that his wife may plague his heart out!</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS JENNINGS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MARIANNE sobs even harder.</context>
      <utterance>But he is not the only young man worth having, my dear, and with your pretty face you will never want for admirers.</utterance>

      <context>After a moment BRANDON nods. He seems unable to remain still or calm and finds it difficult to begin speaking.</context>
      <utterance>I confess that is precisely what I had hoped for. Marianne suffers cruelly, and what pains me most is how hard she tries to justify Mr Willoughby. But you know her disposition.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLONEL BRANDON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Perhaps I--my regard for you all-- Miss Dashwood, will you allow me to prove it by relating some circumstances which nothing but an earnest desire of being useful--</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>

      <utterance>You have something to tell me of Mr Willoughby.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLONEL BRANDON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ELINOR nods.</context>
      <utterance>When I quitted Barton last--but I must go further back. A short account of myself will be necessary. No doubt... no doubt Mrs Jennings has apprised you of certain events in my past--the sad outcome of my connection with a young woman named Eliza.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLONEL BRANDON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This is strong stuff. ELINOR's concern deepens.</context>
      <utterance>What is not commonly known is that twenty years ago, Eliza bore an illegitimate child. The father, whoever he was, abandoned them.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLONEL BRANDON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He paces about, barely able to conceal his distress.</context>
      <utterance>As she lay dying, she begged me to look after the child. Eliza died in my arms, broken, wasted away--ah! Miss Dashwood, such a subject-- untouched for so many years--it is dangerous...</utterance>
   <speaker>COLONEL BRANDON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I had failed Eliza in every other way--I could not refuse her now. I took the child--Beth is her name-- and placed her with a family where I could be sure she would be well looked after. I saw her whenever I could. I saw that she was headstrong like her mother--and, God forgive me, I indulged her, I allowed her too much freedom. Almost a year ago, she disappeared.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Disappeared!</utterance>
   <speaker>COLONEL BRANDON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I instigated a search but for eight months I was left to imagine the worst. At last, on the day of the Delaford picnic, I received the first news her. She was with child... and the blackguard who had-- BRANDON stops and looks straight at ELINOR.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>BRANDON nods. ELINOR drops into a chair, utterly shocked.</context>
      <utterance>Good God. Do you mean--Willoughby?</utterance>
   <speaker>COLONEL BRANDON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Before I could return to confront him, Lady Allen learned of his behaviour and turned him from the house. He beat a hasty retreat to London--</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes! He left us that morning, without any explanation!</utterance>
   <speaker>COLONEL BRANDON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Lady Allen had annulled his legacy. He was left with next to nothing, and in danger of losing all that remained to his debtors--</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>BRANDON is silent. ELINOR is breathless.</context>
      <utterance>--and so abandoned Marianne for Miss Grey and her fifty thousand pounds.</utterance>

   <speaker>BRANDON</speaker>

      <context>ELINOR nods and is silent for a moment.</context>

      <context>A pause.</context>
      <utterance>She has chosen to go into the country for her confinement. Such has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter, and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLONEL BRANDON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>BRANDON moves to the door and then stops. He turns to her and speaks with effort.</context>
      <utterance>I would not have burdened you, Miss Dashwood, had I not from my heart believed it might, in time, lessen your sister's regrets.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLONEL BRANDON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She looks up at BRANDON. Silence.</context>
      <utterance>I have described Mr Willoughby as the worst of libertines--but I have since learned from Lady Allen that he did mean to propose that day. Therefore I cannot deny that his intentions towards Marianne were honourable, and I feel certain he would have married her, had it not been for--for the money.</utterance>

   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>LUCY's eyes are sharp as broken glass. EDWARD remains on his feet, looking helplessly from one woman to the other.</context>
      <utterance>Do sit down, Mr Ferrars.</utterance>
   <speaker>LUCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This is precisely what EDWARD had thought. He tries to smile but his facial muscles won't work. ELINOR decides to fetch help.</context>

   <speaker>MARIANNE</speaker>

      <context>Again, MARIANNE endeavours to ignite the lovers. ELINOR tries to silence MARIANNE with her eyes but to no avail. MARIANNE puts their coolness down to the presence of LUCY, at whom she glances with a none too friendly air.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>ELINOR is appalled by this remark but MARIANNE does not notice it and turns back to LUCY earnestly.</context>
      <utterance>Perhaps, Miss Marianne, you think young men never honour their engagements, little or great.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>EDWARD makes an uncomfortable noise.</context>
      <utterance>No, indeed--for Edward is the most fearful of giving pain and the most incapable of being selfish of anyone I ever saw.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <context>He shakes hands with ELINOR and with MARIANNE, who is silent with dismay. LUCY takes EDWARD's arm and looks up at him proprietorially. After a stiff bow and a muttered farewell from EDWARD, they leave. MARIANNE looks at her sister in astonishment.</context>

   <speaker>MARIANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But Edward loves you.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He made me no promises. He tried to tell me about Lucy.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He cannot marry her.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>

   <speaker>MARIANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ELINOR tries hard to be controlled.</context>
      <utterance>No--but nor would I have him marry where he does not love.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Edward made his promise a long time ago, long before he met me. Though he may... harbour some regret, I believe he will be happy--in the knowledge that he did his duty and kept his word. After all--after all that is bewitching in the idea of one's happiness depending entirely on one person, it is not always possible. We must accept. Edward will marry Lucy--and you and I will go home.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ELINOR finally explodes. She turns upon MARIANNE almost savagely.</context>
      <utterance>Always resignation and acceptance! Always prudence and honour and duty! Elinor, where is your heart?</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Complete silence. Then MARIANNE speaks in a whisper.</context>
      <utterance>What do you know of my heart? What do you know of anything but your own suffering? For weeks, Marianne, I have had this pressing on me without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature. It was forced upon me by the very person whose prior claims ruined all my hopes. I have had to endure her exultation again and again while knowing myself to be divided from Edward forever. Believe me, Marianne, had I not been bound to silence I could have produced proof enough of a broken heart even for you.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MARIANNE bursts into sobs and flings her arms around ELINOR, who, almost impatiently, tries to comfort her.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, Elinor!</utterance>

      <utterance>No. Not to find it in you. I cannot be ignorant that to you--to your goodness--I owe it all. I feel it. I would express it if I could, but, as you know, I am no orator.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELINOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But EDWARD clearly believes she has been instrumental in the offer. He frowns slightly before speaking with rather an effort.</context>

      <context>ELINOR tries to stem the flow but MARIANNE continues.</context>
      <utterance>My illness has made me consider the past. I saw in my own behaviour nothing but imprudence--and worse. I was insolent and unjust to everyone--</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ELINOR embraces her. They stand with their arms round one another in silence for a moment. Then MARIANNE breaks away and speaks with great good humour and energy.</context>
      <utterance>--but you--you I wronged above all. Only I knew your heart and its sorrows but even then I was never a grain more compassionate. I brought my illness upon myself--I wanted to destroy myself. And had I succeeded, what misery should I have caused you?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I shall mend my ways! I shall no longer worry others nor torture myself. I am determined to enter on a course of serious study---Colonel Brandon has promised me the run of his library and I shall read at least six hours a day. By the end of the year I expect to have improved my learning a very great deal.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I seen him myself, ma'am, and his lady too, Miss Lucy Steele as was-- they were stopping in a chaise at the New London Inn. I happened to look up as I passed the chaise and I see it was Miss Steele. So I took off my hat and she inquired after you, ma'am, and all the young ladies, especially Miss Dashwood, and bid me I should give you her and Mr Ferrars's best compliments and service and how they'd be sure to send you a piece of the cake.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yes. I received a letter from Miss Steele--or Mrs Ferrars, I should say-- communicating the... the transfer of her affections to my brother Robert. They were much thrown together in London, I believe, and... and in view of the change in my circumstances, I felt it only fair that Miss Steele be released from our engagement.
