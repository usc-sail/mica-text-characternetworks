      <utterance>You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with hm?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mierzwiak nods. He's attentive, pleasant, and neutral throughout.</context>
      <utterance>What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.</utterance>
   <speaker>CLEMENTINE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>It's complicated. Y'know?</context>
      <utterance>Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and...</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there. She nods, thinks.</utterance>

      <context>He has no other thoughts. He glances up, spots a female figure in the distance, walking in his direction. She stands out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded sweatshirt. It's Clementine. He watches her for a bit, then as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least pretends to. Once she passed, he watches her walk away. She stops and stares out at the ocean. Joel writes.</context>
      <utterance>January 13th, 2006. Today I skipped work and took the train out to Montauk.  It's cold.  The sky is gray.  I don't know what else to say. Nothing happens. Nothing changes. I saw Naomi last night. We had sex. It was weird to fall into our old familiar sex life so easily. Like no time has passed. After two years apart suddenly we're talking about getting together again. I guess that's good.</utterance>

      <mode>V.O. - CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Later: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the season. He peeks cautiously in a dark window. Later: Joel digs into the sand with a stick.</context>
      <utterance>If I'm constitutionally incapable of making eye-contact with a woman I don't know. I guess I'd better get back to Naomi.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?</utterance>

      <context>That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.</context>
      <utterance>Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that?</utterance>

      <utterance>Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.</utterance>

      <utterance>I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality.</utterance>

      <utterance>Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?</utterance>

      <utterance>Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOEL</speaker>

   <speaker>CLEMENTINE</speaker>

   <speaker>CLEMENTINE</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOEL</speaker>

      <utterance>What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.</utterance>

      <utterance>Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?</utterance>

      <context>Joel squints to see inside the van. Two dark figures talk. One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily illuminates the interior. The figure in the driver seat rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel.</context>

There's some illegible initials stamped on it.</context>

      <context>He swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store packaging. He sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone.</context>
      <utterance>The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.</utterance>

I saw other people having fun and I wanted it.
