      <context>Sam is at the podium. He looks out across the audience. There are a couple of flirtatious whistles, laughter. Sam smiles, silencing them with a wave of his hand.</context>
      <utterance>Oh yeah.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Cheers, applause. Sam waits for the kids to settle.</context>

      <utterance>Come on. Beats study hall, doesn't it?</utterance>
   <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>Boos as we FIND... JIMMY LEACH, 18, grumge look, long hair. He sits with a clique of white trashy types, or at least what passes for such at Blue Bay School. Jimmy appears a bit more genuine, as does... SUZlE TOLLER, a boyish brunette, seated nearby, but with just enough space between her and everyone else to mark her as a loner. She studies Sam Lombardo with a dark, sullen stare.</context>
      <utterance>No!</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>KIRK</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>This remark is greeted by a chorus of laughter as we FIND... KIRK, one of the golden boys, seated with Kelly and Nicole.</context>
      <utterance>He means masturbate...</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Loud laughter. Sam quiets them again, then turns to the blackboard, where he begins to write, in big letters -- S-E-X. The kids start to cheer. Sam writes another word -- C-R-I-M-E-S. The cheering fades into silence.</context>
      <utterance>Something Kirk with which I'm sure you have hands-on experience.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Sam turns to the wings, his hand out to welcome the visitors... RAY DUQUETTE, mid-thirties, with the lanky build of a light heavyweight, walks out onto the stage. He's dressed in a dark suit, dark hair combed straight back above steel-rimmed glasses. GLORIA PEREZ walks at his side. She's a good six inches shorter than Ray, with a sweet face. Attractive but no stunner. About five kids applaud. Ray takes the podium.</context>
      <utterance>We've all heard the words, date rape, sexual harassment. We've talked about some of these things in this room.  Our speakers today head up the Blue Bay Police Sex Crimes Unit -- Detectives Ray Duquette and Gloria Perez.  They're here to give you what we hope will be a fresh perspective on these subjects, and to answer any questions you night have.</utterance>
   <speaker>RAY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you for having us. We'll each talk for ten or fifteen minutes, then open it up to your questions...</utterance>

      <context>A moment.</context>
      <utterance>Let's begin with a question. What is a sex crime?</utterance>
   <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This draws a few laughs from the kids, a couple of thin smiles from Sam and Gloria. And none at all from Ray Duquette.</context>

      <utterance>Anybody in particular?</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Gloria does a slow double-take, looking from Sam to the photo and back again.</context>

      <utterance>So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Gloria seems to find this amusing. Ray stands at her side, looks at Sam. Sam feels it, makes eye contact with Ray -- a beat -- at which point, Ray puts a hand on Gloria's back.</context>
      <utterance>I have the feeling, they got it down already. They're a step ahead of us, Artie.</utterance>

      <context>Sam just laughs at him.</context>
      <utterance>All right. I could party on that.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He points to a beautiful triple-masted schooner headed out of the bay, under sail.</context>
      <utterance>That's about all it's good for.  That's the one to have.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He pulls his eyes from the boat, sets about coiling a line.</context>
      <utterance>The Windward Passage. I crewed on that one summer.  Long time ago.</utterance>

      <utterance>You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class... No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He tosses Jimmy the coiled line. Jimmy's caught off-guard, but catches it at the last second, then shares the laugh with Sam.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>Sam and Jimmy turn to find Kelly Van Ryan at the far end of the dock. She's fresh from cheerleader practice, in a white blouse knotted at the bottom to REVEAL a flat, tanned stomach; open at the top to REVEAL the swelling of her breasts. She favors Sam with a coy smile.</context>
      <utterance>Can I play too? Or is it just for boys?</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sam smiles, remembering.</context>
      <utterance>So who's washing your car this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?  The senior car wash, remember?  Tamara's making a schedule. She said you bought a coupon but you're not on anybody's list.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sam places the coiled hose on top of a locker then starts up the dock, Jimmy at his side. Kelly falls in with then.</context>
      <utterance>Well, you know. Figured I'd buy a Washing ticket, support the effort. That old Jeep of mine's kind of a waste of time, don't you think?</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sam just looks at her. She looks back -- big, pleading eyes.</context>
      <utterance>Not at all. How about if Nicole and I do it? We're working as a team.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Okay, try me on Sunday. I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday. You guys can wash the mud off.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sam doesn't answer right away. He looks toward the school.</context>
      <utterance>Deal.  You know, I just looked out front. My ride wasn't there. You suppose you could give me one?</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Sam hesitates, momentarily at a loss, then turns to Jimmy, who seems to regard Kelly with something akin to physical pain.</context>
      <utterance>You wouldn't want me to walk, would you? I mean like, something bad might happen.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suzie's eyes go cold. She signals the groundsman, who turns the key. The CAR SPLUTTERS to life. Suzie flashes a smile, then sticks out her tongue -- which has been pierced by a silver stud.</context>

      <utterance>I flat don't like the guy, Glory. He's dirty. And I'll tell you something else. You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war. Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him. The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.</utterance>

She gasps for air. Kelly finally lets go, but remains on her knees between Suzie's legs, breathing hard. A moment. Kelly touches Suzie's face.</context>

I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough. Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun. I yelled at her to put it down.

      <context>Ray kneels. He begins to tighten the winch. Sam watches him for a moment, then reaches around behind his back to unhook the short line which holds the boom. The mainsail catches wind, swinging the boom in a wide arc, directly at Ray. Ray looks up, sees it coming just in time to catch it on his arm. The blow is enough to send him sprawling through the lifelines, where he just manages to grab one of the nylon cords. Sam ducks as the boon continues to swing erratically above the deck, watching as Ray hauls himself on board. The boat no longer driven by the wind, bobs up and down on a small ground swell. The two men face each other.</context>

      <context>Ray nods, then reaches down, pulls off the winch handle and starts with it toward Sam. Sam looks around. He jerks open a storage compartment. A diver's weight belt tumbles out. Sam grabs it, swings it over his head in circles, letting the weight pick up momentum, preparing to throw. Ray crouches, still brandishing the winch handle. The boom sweeps the deck. Sam throws the belt. Ray grabs a shroud, dances out of the way, then steadies himself, a mean grin spreading across his face. There's no tine for Sam to look for anything else. Ray moves quickly across the deck -- a menacing sight -- tall, well-muscled, the handle gleaming in his hand. Sam pulls himself out of the cockpit. Ray jumps in. But that's as far as he gets. WHOOSH -- A spear pierces Ray's thigh. He screams, goes down, the handle skittering across the deck. Ray follows it with his eyes, reaching out, then freezing as he sees something else. He draws in his hand as if bitten.</context>

   <speaker>RAY</speaker>

      <context>WHOOSH -- A second spear penetrates Ray's shoulder. He loses his grip. The boat heels over, dumping Ray into the water. Suzie puts down her spear gun. She goes to a storage locker, takes out a bait bucket. She steps up on the deck. Ray is floating not far from the boat, the water going red around him. He calls out...</context>

      <context>Come on Sam, we did it. We put the screws to the Van Ryans. We won. She hands a glass to Sam, takes the other. He puts it to his lips, suddenly hesitates, thinks, sniffs the glass. A moment. Suzie shakes her head.</context>
