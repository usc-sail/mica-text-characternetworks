      <context>The blast shield continues to peel away. David and Steve drop down below the dash, hiding from view. As the view becomes unobstructed we SEE...</context>

   <speaker>PRESIDENT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Taking the advice, the President DIVES. He's met by two flanking Fighters (EAGLES 9 &amp; 2) as they cruise the underbelly of the City Destroyer. Sure enough, the SCHISM is opening, preparing to fire the WALL OF DESTRUCTION.</context>
      <utterance>I've got an idea. Keep 'em off my tail.</utterance>
   <speaker>PRESIDENT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The President locks the SCHISM hatchway into the center of his HUD (heads up display). Just as he FIRES, Eagle 9 is BLOWN OUT OF THE SKY. It rocks the President, sending his missile off target. Off balance, the missile hits just wide of the hatchway and EXPLODES, rocking the entire ship.</context>
      <utterance>Let's take 'em out before they take us out.</utterance>

   <speaker>RUSSELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Russell turns off his radio as he banks UPWARD towards the open SCHISM. The climb is steep, and the bi-wing nearly stalls out. Suddenly the bright lights VANISH and the beam begins to form. Russell's bi-wing just makes it INSIDE THE OPEN SCHISM and disappears from view. The President and remaining fighters BANK AWAY, clearing. Suddenly, A GIGANTIC EXPLOSION, RIPS THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE SPACE CRAFT. It's causing a CHAIN REACTION of explosion. Teetering, the entire space ship, turns away out of control.</context>
      <utterance>I've got to, kid. You were always better at taking care of them than I was anyways.</utterance>
