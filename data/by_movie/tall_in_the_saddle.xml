   <speaker>RED ROCK STAGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Rocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of Dave, the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead horses. He pauses close to one horse's head. Rocklin sees Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances around, and raise it to drink. The bottle is almost to Dave's lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. The bottle is knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground. Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds amusing despite its seriousness. Old Dave rants and snorts -- beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and exhibits his utter disgust generally.</context>

      <context>Dave glares at Rocklin climbing up to the seat, and he is about to order him down when Rocklin, now seated, looks down at him and asks rather wistfully --</context>

   <speaker>ROCKLIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dave does mind, but his better judgment tells him to step carefully in his attitude toward this stranger, who does things first, then asks permission. His only answer to Rocklin is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough. And now Dave turns on the Agent, who becomes the target of his pent-up wrath.</context>

      <context>That last from Arly brings a kind of smile to Rocklin's face -- a smile that says in effect -- "Are you kidding?" He gets up from the bunk to go to the door, and finding himself still holding Arly's knife, throws it back to her in a seemingly casual manner. It passes too close to Arly for comfort and, Rocklin just opening the door, gets the knife right back -- that close to his ear he feels the breeze. He looks at it, quivering in the door. Then, moving to Arly in what could be construed as a threatening manner, he takes her in his arms and kisses her. Arly is caught completely unaware. Rocklin's action disarms her. But it is, after all, what she really wants, so before the kiss ends, Arly's arms slowly entwine themselves around Rocklin's neck. In the middle of the kiss Rocklin gently but forcefully takes her arms from around his neck and puts her from him.</context>
