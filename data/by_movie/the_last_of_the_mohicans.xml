      <utterance>Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAGUA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hawkeye realizes this is true.</context>
      <utterance>It made our French father happy to never have to fight the same Yengeese again. He told me this without telling me this.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hawkeye appears to be losing his debate with Magua.</context>
      <utterance>No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one ... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk &amp; Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.</utterance>

      <context>Magua starts to rebut. Sachem holds up his hand and stops him. Nobody talks. Sachem whispers to the older men on either side of him.</context>
      <utterance>Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man? Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do? Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads &amp; brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold? ...  Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt &amp; work the land? Or of dogs? ... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs? ... Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people ... Let the children of the dead Munro go free ... I speak the truth.</utterance>
