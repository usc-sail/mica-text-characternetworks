      <utterance>I know this is difficult for you, but there's been no mistake. The house and all their assets, including your father's practise, are now property of the bank in default of the mortgage.</utterance>

      <utterance>But I'm telling you, my father put away every penny he ever earned. They owned that house outright. Why would he have a mortgage?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>My guess is because he let people pay him in beans &amp; eggs or whatever they had, instead of money.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And so he's penalized for not turning away people who couldn't afford his help? He was a doctor.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, I know, he was a very good man but in banking terms, in the reality of what makes this world actually function, he was an irresponsible man. I'm sorry, but you oughta to know the truth. This Depression is going to last for a long while..</utterance>

      <context>August is pointing to one of the lions - with a ratty mane and visible rib cage. Smaller than the tiger, Jacob has a bit more nerve. He reaches for a bucket...August suddenly shouts, unnerving Jacob even more:</context>

      <context>August is having a grand time. Jacob smirks. Rex is rubbing his mangy coat against the cage bars. Jacob fumbles, removing the padlock and laying it at his feet. He lifts the bucket and waits. When Rex turns away from the cage door, Jacob swings it open. But before he can spill out the contents of the bucket: Rex turns and chomps his huge jaw down on Jacob's arm. JACOB SCREAMS. The bucket drops, spilling the entrails inside which cause Rex to release Jacob's arm and attack the food. Jacob slams the cage shut and checks to see if he has an arm. He does but it is dripping with saliva and as red as if he'd dipped it in boiling water. But no skin is broken. August is hysterically laughing. Furious, Jacob storms off;</context>

      <context>Marlena exhausted, eases into Jacob's arms. It's over. WIDE ANGLE: Jacob and Marlena and their animals, as the giant tent of the Benzini Bros. Big Top falls to the ground.</context>

      <utterance>I convinced my dean to let me take my finals. Marlena was right. With my degree, our animals and Marlena's acts, Ringling got a sweet deal. Our son was born our first season. We named him Walter. He spent the first seven years of his life with Ringling.</utterance>

      <context>A KNOCK. Charlie peeks through the window and sees a COP:</context>
      <utterance>I never told Marlena it was Rosie who got August. I didn't want her to know. When Rosie passed on, she cried for days. I owe that bull my whole life...my kids, everything..</utterance>

   <speaker>CHARLIE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Understanding the ruse, Jacob starts to play the part of a stroke victim: he opens his mouth, his jaw quivers. He reaches for his glass with a shaking arm. Charlie helps him. Jacob holds out his tongue like a parrot's as Charlie helps him drink. The Cop watches with a blank expression. Jacob swallows and nods speechless, smiles and manages to drool. Beat. The Cop wonders. Then, pulling out his card:</context>
      <utterance>He can't talk. Had a major stroke a few years back. But he's doing well. Ain't ya Pop?</utterance>
   <speaker>COP</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Cop exits. Charlie returns to sit opposite Jacob. They consider this unspoken proposal:</context>
      <utterance>OK, well, thanks for your time. Here's my number in case you hear of anything. Sorry to bother you.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Beat as Charlie pours another shot. Then:</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I wonder if we can get you into the book of records. "Oldest man who ever ran away with the circus".</utterance>
