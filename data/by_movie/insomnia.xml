Just good guys and bad guys. Simple. A cloud passes over his face. CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd) Except for this. Holds up a file. The name written on the lip: KAY CONNELL.</context>

You'll help us catch him. FRED (cont'd) (into phone) Okay. (slaps phone closed) That was Ellie. Will turns back to him. FRED (cont'd) They found Farrell's bullet. Says it looks like a 357. After the autopsy Rich can drive 'em both to the lab in Anchorage. Have a murder weapon by morning. Fred crosses his arms. Sarcastic. FRED (cont'd) That is, if it's alright with you.</context>

Well how about this one - you're standing right where her naked body was found wrapped up in a garbage bag. Tanya's eyes grow wide. She looks around her. Disgusting, rotten.

      <context>grandmother took me to Vancouver. We were walking along the street one day when these two men ran past and snatched my grandmother's purse right from under her arm. Right from under her arm. That night a police officer came to our hotel room to ask us questions. Stood the whole time. The ferry pitches again. Will grabs on to the railing. Looking down at this little man. Hate in his eyes. WALTER (cont'd) His uniform looked brand new. His shoes and badge were polished, his billy club, his belt buckle. All perfect. He was like a soldier, but better. Walter reaches up to blow his nose. Will's eyes look on in disgust - his knuckles are still red and swollen. From beating Kay Connell to death. WALTER (cont'd) Made a huge impression on me. His goodness. Gave me an instant respect for the police. I tried to become a cop when I left high school, but... He points to his hearing-aid.

Her eyes, looking up at him. His shoulders droop. Exhausted. Rachel reaches up. Catches him in her arms. Strong arms. Caring. Will buries his face in her neck. Wants to be swallowed up. Rachel holds him. Arms encircling. Will breathes her in. Sweet, soft, safe. Looks up. His mouth suddenly finding hers. A kiss, hungry, urgent. His arms move to surround her.</context>

      <context>Will tenses his jaw. Rachel, listens in horror. WILL (cont'd) When he was done, he got a rope and a kitchen stool and hanged the boy in the basement of the apartment building. But he didn't do a good enough job. The little boy's neck didn't break and he died from shock. The landlord found him five days later. Rachel reaches for Will's hand. Squeezes it.</context>
      <utterance>There was this guy named Weston Dobbs. Twenty-four. Worked as a part-time stock boy in a copy store. Every morning he'd sit at the only window in his apartment and watch an eight year-old boy get picked up by his carpool across the street. And every afternoon he'd watch the boy get dropped off again. He did this for about six months. Until one day he got up the nerve to cross the street and grab the boy before his carpool came. Kept him in his apartment for three days. Tortured him. Raped him. Made him do things...</utterance>

      <context>We hear the TV in the other room. An older MAN, Ellie's father, appears in the doorway. Thick glasses, grey stubble, big paunch. Wearing a flannel robe.</context>
      <utterance>Me, Pop!</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLIE'S DAD</speaker>

      <context>Will enters the monument.</context>
      <utterance>Hi, Will...</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What the hell are you doing calling me at the station? A gust of wind WHORLS through the monument.</utterance>
   <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Will's eyes pierce into him.</context>
      <utterance>I figured we should touch base. Compare notes. I think it went well. What did you think?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Randy Stetz is in jail.</utterance>
   <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Told you I could write an ending.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Walter looks at the open hand. Hugs his jacket to him.</context>
      <utterance>Congratulations. Will holds out his hand. WILL  The tape.</utterance>
   <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I thought maybe we could talk some more.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>There's nothing more to talk about.</utterance>
   <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Will breaks. Rushes Walter. Slams him against one of the concrete pilasters.</context>
      <utterance>But we work so well together...</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Another wave CRASHES. Sprays them. Walter looks up into Will's bloodshot eyes.</context>
      <utterance>We do nothing well together.  Nothing! You understand me?</utterance>
   <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He holds up the tape. Will grabs it, shoves Walter to the side. Yanks the tape out of the cassette. Steps back and HURLS it into the sea. Waves engulf it hungrily. Walter watches him. WALTER (cont'd) You're not sleeping, are you?</context>
      <utterance>You run on two settings, Will. I've noticed that... Will tightens his grip. WALTER  You jump from calm to rage in the blink of an eye. That's okay. I do that too.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What the hell do you know?</utterance>
   <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Kay told me. She comes to me, you know. Tells me things. About you. About me.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUSE.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Whips around...</context>
      <utterance>WALTER  Does Detective Eckhart come to you? Will curls his fists. WALTER  Does he ask you why you shot him?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I told you that was an accident!</utterance>
   <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then so was mine...</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't you pull that shit with me.</utterance>
   <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>When she called me that night from the party, she'd had a fight with Randy. Wanted to talk. I told her to meet me at our special place. The cabin at the beach... A couple RAVENS alight nearby. Flapping their wings. SCREECHING into the wind. WALTER (cont'd) ...When she came she was barefoot. And there was liquor on her breath. I only wanted to comfort her. To touch her. She could have at least let me do that. Her skin...it was like everything I'd ever written about. A dark shadow crosses his face. Holds on to the coiled rope of the statue. Will hisses.</context>
      <utterance>I didn't want to kill her, Will. Steps closer to him. Beseeching. WALTER</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Couldn't get it up, Walter?</utterance>
   <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>WILL'S HAND shoots out. Clamps around Walter's neck.</context>
      <utterance>It was when I went to kiss her. She started laughing. I got angry. After all I'd given her. All I'd shared with her. I just wanted to make her stop. That's all. Walter. Squeezing the bronze rope. WALTER  From calm to rage in the blink of an eye. Locks eyes with Will. Conspiratorial. WALTER  Remember?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Walter's face, starts turning red.</context>
      <utterance>Like this?</utterance>
   <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes. Like that.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This an accident, Walter?</utterance>
   <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Will looks deep into Walter's eyes. Squeezing harder. Pure hatred.</context>
      <utterance>If you want it to be...</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Their eyes, locked. Veins, popping along Walter's temples. Lip quivering... JUST THEN a BELL sounds in the distance. Will looks up. A LINE OF FISHING BOATS coming back in. Will, looks back at Walter. Throws him to the ground. Sickened. WILL (cont'd) Get the fuck out of town, Byrd. Leave and never come back. Walter COUGHS. Holding his neck. Enjoying this.</context>
      <utterance>It took ten minutes to beat Kay Connell to death. Ten minutes.</utterance>
   <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He pulls himself to his feet. A little unsteady. Takes out a handkerchief. Dabs his forehead. WALTER (cont'd) The never coming back part, though. I'm not sure. To tell you the truth this has been kind of fun. Going to the station, meeting all those nice people. Talking with you. He shrugs. Walks past Will. WALTER (cont'd) I might miss it. Will turns. Watches him walk away. Walter hesitates. Turns back. WALTER (cont'd) I especially like that new detective. Will looks at him. Back straightening. WALTER (cont'd) Detective Burr. (smiles) I liked her very much. Has a real vitality. Will's stomach jumps. Walter turns back. Continues on. The little man in a beige windbreaker.</context>
      <utterance>I have a summer house up by Kgun Lake. I'm going to write my next novel there. It's about a famous detective who goes bad. Will shoots him a look. WALTER  Just kidding.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHIEF NYBACK</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>PULL BACK to reveal Chief Nyback sitting at his desk. Will stands before him. Signing papers. A bottle of bourbon on the desk. Some paper cups half filled. CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd) When are you taking off? Will checks his watch.</context>
      <utterance>I was hoping not to send you back with so much paperwork, Will.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Fred, standing over by the filing cabinet. Toothpick in his mouth.</context>
      <utterance>Six-thirty.</utterance>
   <speaker>FRED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nyback chuckles.</context>
      <utterance>If Spencer's not too drunk to fly.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHIEF NYBACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Can't talk you into staying for a couple of days? Do some fishing? Show you what normally goes on around here. Will shakes his head.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have to get back.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHIEF NYBACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Will caps the pen. Uncomfortable. Nods towards Fred.</context>
      <utterance>Too bad... Looks over at Fred picking his teeth. CHIEF NYBACK  ...Brought some real class to the place. But, Seattle needs its hero back.  Couldn't have done it without you, Will.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JUST THEN the door swings open. They look over as ELLIE hurries in. She smiles. Looks tired.</context>
      <utterance>Had a lot of help from Nightmute's finest.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Didn't want to miss anything.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHIEF NYBACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Good.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHIEF NYBACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>An awkward beat. Ellie walks over to Will. Looks up. Suddenly throws her arms around him. ELLIE (cont'd) I thought what you did on this case was amazing. Will holds his hands out. Not sure what to do. Looks down at the top of Ellie's head.</context>
      <utterance>Sure.</utterance>

   <speaker>ELLIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She stops. Rachel behind her. Taking in the strange feeling in the room. Walks over to the bed. Eyes riveted on the 39/13. On the bullet. Rachel, behind her.</context>
      <utterance>Detective Dormer?</utterance>
   <speaker>RACHEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ellie, her mind races. Notices TORN PHOTOGRAPH PIECES in the trash can. Reaches in and pulls some out. A puzzle.</context>

      <context>WALTER standing there. At the other end of the hallway. Shoulders slumped. Will shakes his head.</context>
      <utterance>Here to visit me? Will whips around.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Walter looks around.</context>
      <utterance>No. FLIES, bouncing against the screen door. WILL  I'm here to end this.</utterance>

      <context>Will takes a step forward...</context>
      <utterance>We're on the same side, Will. You know that. After what we've been through together. We're partners. Bound by a secret.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Pulls out his SMITH AND WESSON. Walter. Looks at the gun. Inches back.</context>
      <utterance>That's where you're wrong, Walter. Slowly reaches into his jacket... WILL  There is no secret. Because the biggest difference between you and me is what we will or will not live with...</utterance>
   <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>SUDDENLY, darts out of sight. Swings back into the doorway with a SHOTGUN... BAM! Will's shoulder explodes with blood.</context>

      <context>Nothing. Walter continues staring out the window. Will raises his voice. WILL (cont'd) Walter! Walter jumps, whips around. Comes face to face with the barrel of Will Dormer's gun. Surprised. Absently touches his deaf ear.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>The men LOCK EYES. Wind HOWLING through the boathouse. Killer and Detective. Only a bullet separating them. WALTER suddenly jerks up his shotgun... BANG! He stumbles back. Hit in the gut. Will's Smith and Wesson, smoking. No longer jammed. Walter, touches the blood. Looks back at Will. Staggering. CRACK! The rotting floor gives way beneath him. He CRIES out, falls. Drops into the icy water below. SILENCE. Will steps over to the hole. Looks down at</context>

      <utterance>Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His blood, pumping out in rivulets. Ellie looks down at him. Her hero. Moves up to the wound in his arm.</context>
      <utterance>Because I just couldn't be wrong.  Don't ever get that way, Ellie. Don't ever lose your way. It blurs the line.</utterance>

That's what you'd tell me. I've been a detective for four weeks and I say you're coming with me. She gets up. Slips her arms under his shoulders. Starts hoisting him up. ELLIE (cont'd) C'mon... Will. Struggling to his knees. Every inch of him, screaming in pain. Gets to his feet. Arm slung around this tiny, young woman.</context>
