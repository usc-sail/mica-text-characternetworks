      <context>Frank goes out the door. It closes. Kathleen tiptoes into the hall and looks through the fish-eye peephole watching as he goes down the stairs, disappearing from sight. She walks into:</context>

      <context>And now we hear Kathleen's voice replaced by the voice of NY 152, a man named JOE FOX --</context>

      <utterance>Forget it. We don't talk about anything personal. We made a rule about that. I don't know his name, what he does or exactly where he lives, so it will be really easy to stop seeing him, because I'm not.</utterance>

Then she opens her copy of Pride and Prejudice and looks at it. She can't focus. A man comes into the restaurant and she looks up hopefully at him. But he's going to meet another group of people.

   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Joe puts it between his mouth and his nose like a mustache.</context>
      <utterance>What have we have? A red, no, crimson rose, tucked into the pages. Something you read about in a book, no doubt. One of those books with a lady in a nightgown on the cover about to throw herself off a cliff. She holds her hand out for it. KATHLEEN  Give it to me.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She grabs the rose. Puts it back in the book. KATHLEEN (cont'd) Please leave. I beg you. He stands up, walks from the table, sits down at the very next table, with his back to her. The door to the restaurant opens. Kathleen looks at it hopefully. A pleasant looking man, who's immediately joined by a pleasant looking woman. For a moment, Kathleen looks just a little droopy, as if the wind has just gone out of her sails. She takes out her compact, looks into her mirror. She slides it over to look behind her, at him, just as he's looking sideways at her. He turns away suddenly. Then she blots her lipstick with her handkerchief.</context>

      <utterance>-- for what happened. I feel terrible that you found yourself in a situation that caused you additional pain. But I'm absolutely sure that whatever you said last night was provoked, even deserved. And everyone says things they regret when they're worried or stressed. You were expecting to see someone you trusted and met the enemy instead. The fault is mine.</utterance>
