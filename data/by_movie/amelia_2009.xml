      <utterance>Sure I can't talk you inta somethin' more adventurous?</utterance>
   <speaker>AMELIA</speaker>

   <speaker>AMELIA</speaker>
      <mode>V.O. - CONT'D</mode>
      <context>They reach the door, already ajar. It says GEORGE PALMER PUTNAM on a small bronze plate. The secretary gingerly pushes it open... ...revealing George on the phone in crisp shirtsleeves and suspenders. He paces, prowls, trailing the cord behind him, negotiating non-stop even as he flips through a pile of messages. Off again, stalking the room. Dashing, electric, masterful.</context>
      <utterance>I knew, of course, that he wasn't going to choose me. I had no discernible qualifications whatsoever.</utterance>

      <context>He gestures again, more commandingly. Sit. She doesn't move, she doesn't smile. She doesn't take her steady gaze from him. He hangs up the phone. They stare at each other for a frozen beat. He breaks the moment with a charming smile...</context>
      <utterance>I didn't know whether to laugh or throw something at the jerk.</utterance>

   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Understood...? G</context>
      <utterance>Sure. My role is selling this event to the public. There will be a contract for the girl's story with the New York Times. Also a book to be published over her name.</utterance>

      <context>No punches pulled. Not his style.</context>
      <utterance>That's good for your chances. Because your level of flying experience wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would be considered for this. If the woman were to do any flying at all.</utterance>
   <speaker>AMELIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Because the hook is that we're making the woman the commander. The pilot will sign a contract saying he is under her direction and control. It's her ship, her flight.</utterance>
