      <context>The various boys, including NEIL, KNOX, and CAMERON, line up holding banners. Ahead of them is the old man, followed by the boy with the bagpipes with the two youngest boys at the front.</context>

      <context>The boys hoist the banners and the bagpipes begin to play loudly. The small group marches out of the room and down a set of stairs into a church. The pews are filled with students and parents while the teachers, all dressed in robes, are seated at the front of the church behind the headmaster. The boys break off to either side at the front of the church. The bagpipes cease and the headmaster, MR. NOLAN, walks over to the old man carrying the candle.</context>

      <context>An organ begins to play as the old man goes forward with shaking hands to the young boys in the front pew. Each boy is holding a candle and he bends over to light the first one. Each boy in turn lights the candle of the boy next to him.</context>

      <utterance>They're not that different from you, are they? Same haircuts. Full of hormones, just like you. Invincible, just like you feel. The world is their oyster. They believe they're destined for great things, just like many of you. Their eyes are full of hope, just like you. Did they wait until it was too late to make from their lives even one iota of what they were capable? Because you see gentlmen, these boys are now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen real close, you can hear them whisper their legacy to you. Go on, lean in.</utterance>

   <speaker>KEATING</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Gentlemen, open your text to page twenty-one of the introduction. Mr. Perry, will you read the opening paragraph of the preface, entitled "Understanding Poetry"?</utterance>
   <speaker>NEIL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Keating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board.</context>
      <utterance>Understanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech. Then ask two questions: One, how artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered, and two, how important is that objective. Question one rates the poem's perfection, question two rates its importance. And once these questions have been answered, determining a poem's greatest becomes a relatively simple matter.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEIL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Keating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the students dutifully copy it down.</context>
      <utterance>If the poem's score for perfection is plotted along the horizontal of a graph, and its importance is plotted on the vertical, then calculating the total area of the poem yields the measure of its greatness.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEIL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Neil sets the book down and takes off his glasses. The student sitting across from him is discretely trying to eat. Keating turns away from the chalkboard with a smile.</context>
      <utterance>A sonnet by Byron may score high on the vertical, but only average on the horizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on the other hand, would score high both horizontally and vertically, yielding a massive total area, thereby revealing the poem to be truly great. As you proceed through the poetry in this book, practice this rating method. As your ability to evaluate poems in this matter grows, so will - so will your enjoyment and understanding of poetry.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEATING</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Cameron looks down at the graph he copied into his notes and quickly scribbles it out.</context>
      <utterance>Excrement. That's what I think of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard. We're not laying pipe, we're talking about poetry.</utterance>

      <utterance>I mean, how can you describe poetry like American Bandstand? I like Byron, I give him a 42, but I can't dance to it.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Charlie looks around at the others. He then looks down at his own notes, which consists of drawing breasts.</context>

      <utterance>Thank you Mr. Dalton. Armies of academics going forward, measuring poetry. No, we will not have that here. No more of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard. Now in my class you will learn to think for yourselves again. You will learn to savor words and language. No matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world. I see that look in Mr. Pitt's eye, like nineteenth century literature has nothing to do with going to business school or medical school. Right? Maybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him, thinking "Yes, we should simply study our Mr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter and go quietly about the business of achieving other ambitions." I have a little secret for ya. Huddle up. Huddle up!</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. Medicine, law, business, engineering, these are all noble pursuits, and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. To quote from Whitman: "O me, o life of the questions of these recurring, of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities filled with the foolish. What good amid these, o me, o life? Answer: that you are here. That life exists, and identity. That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse. That the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse.

      <utterance>The Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking the marrow out of life. That's a phrase from Thoreau that we'd invoke at the beginning of each meeting.

And in the enchantment of the moment we'd let poetry work its magic.</utterance>

      <context>Hopkins slowly walks to the front of the class and unfolds his piece of paper.</context>
      <utterance>No, no. It's not stupid. It's a good effort. It touched on one of the major themes, love. A major theme not only in poetry, but life. Mr. Hopkins, you were laughing. You're up.</utterance>

      <utterance>Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins. Yours is the first poem to ever have a negative score on the Pritchard scale. We're not laughing at you, we're laughing near you. I don't mind that your poem had a simple theme. Sometimes the most beautiful poetry can be about simple things, like a cat, or a flower or rain. You see, poetry can come from anything with the stuff of revelation in it. Just don't let your poems be ordinary. Now, who's next?</utterance>

      <utterance>"I sound my barbaric yawp over the rooftops of the world." W. W. Uncle Walt again. Now, for those of you who don't know, a yawp is a loud cry or yell. Now, Todd, I would like you to give us a demonstration of a barbaric "yawp." Come on. You can't yawp sitting down. Let's go. Come on. Up.</utterance>

      <utterance>Mr. Overstreet, driven by deeper force. Yes. We know that. All right. Now, I didn't bring them up here to ridicule them. I brought them up here to illustrate the point of conformity: the difficulty in maintaining your own beliefs in the face of others. Now, those of you -- I see the look in your eyes like, "I would've walked differently." Well, ask yourselves why you were clapping. Now, we all have a great need for acceptance. But you must trust that your beliefs are unique, your own, even though others may think them odd or unpopular, even though the herd may go, "That's baaaaad." Robert Frost said, "Two roads diverged in a wood and I, I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference." Now, I want you to find your own walk right now. Your own way of striding, pacing. Any direction. Anything you want. Whether it's proud, whether it's silly, anything. Gentlemen, the courtyard is yours.</utterance>
