      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We move past a shelf filled with hatboxes and handbags. It is a woman's closet.</context>
      <utterance>I had this image of you, inside of me, like a part of me.</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You planned this whole thing, didn't you?</utterance>
   <speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We glide over the tightly packed hangers, close enough to feel the different fabrics and descend past the dresses to the racks of high heels.</context>
      <utterance>Where's the fucking money?</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All part of the business.</utterance>

      <utterance>All part of the business.</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We slide along the delicate taper of a stiletto heel and reach the bottom of the closet, where we find a pair of black Dr. Martens boots that are tied together with a white rope.</context>
      <utterance>What choice?</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We move up the boots and we see it is a woman who is bound, lying motionless on the floor of the closet, the rope coiling tightly around her wrists. The crack at the bottom of the door lights her face. She is gagged and unconscious, a trickle of blood running down her forehead. Her name is CORKY.</context>
      <utterance>I want out.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>

   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Corky pushes the "open" button. A couple steps into the elevator. His name is CAESAR, a middle-aged Italian, wearing an expensive suit and sunglasses. She is VIOLET; a piece of sexual candy that would melt in your mouth. She hears it again, a guttural sound.</context>
      <utterance>Wait! Hold the elevator.</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She hangs up the phone and walks toward the wall. As she gets closer, we hear a bed rocking, tapping against the wall. The man's breathing grows more and more labored until finally it swells --</context>
      <utterance>Thanks again for this opportunity, Mr. Bianchinni. Goodbye.</utterance>

      <utterance>Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator --</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, sure. I'm Corky.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She is holding two cups of coffee: one black, one with cream.</context>
      <utterance>I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Violet steps inside as Corky goes back to the bathroom to wash off the drain dreck.</context>
      <utterance>Sure. Come on in. Give me a minute.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Corky calls from the bathroom, scrubbing her hands vigorously.</context>
      <utterance>What happened to Rajeev?</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Who?</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She wipes her hands on her overalls, returning to the main room.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So this is temporary for you?</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Violet hands her the cup of black coffee.</context>
      <utterance>Pretty much. One day at a time.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I guessed you were straight black.</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They both sip from the piping hot mugs.</context>
      <utterance>Good guess.</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mmmm ... thanks, I needed this.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>My pleasure ... but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here. I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A favor?</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, I'm sorry --</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, it isn't your fault. The walls here are just so thin.</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Are they really?</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room. But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, no trouble. There's other work to do.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're doing everything yourself?</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She looks at Corky's hands cupped around the mug.</context>
      <utterance>That is so amazing. I'm in awe of people who can fix things. My dad was like that. We never had anything new. Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work. His hands were magic.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Corky smiles.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah ... I bet your car is twenty years old.</utterance>

      <utterance>Truck.</utterance>

   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't, really. I was referred to him.</utterance>

      <utterance>No, but Caesar does. He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.</utterance>

      <utterance>Caesar is your husband?</utterance>

      <utterance>Oh no, no. I'm not the marrying kind.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I should be going. You can drop the cup off anytime.</utterance>

      <utterance>Been awhile, Cork.</utterance>

      <utterance>Five years, two months, sixteen days. How you doing, Sue?</utterance>
   <speaker>SUE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sue opens the refrigerator and pulls out two Old Styles.</context>
      <utterance>Like shit. Now that we're all caught up, how about a drink?</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>I mean a J-O-B. A real job.</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Corky gets off the stool.</context>
      <utterance>Not for me, Sue. I'm straight and narrow. I'm just here to get laid or drunk and hopefully both.</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Looking around, she sees a woman alone at one of the back tables. Through the smoky din, she bears a slight resemblance to Violet. The woman is dressed all in black, including a leather jacket. Smiling, Corky slides into the chair beside her. There is no one smoother.</context>
      <utterance>Thanks for the beer.</utterance>

      <utterance>Hello.</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The woman smiles just as someone taps Corky on the shoulder. She turns and is face-to-face with a large bull of a woman in a heavy leather Chicago Police jacket. She is more wide than fat.</context>
      <utterance>You know ... that outfit would look great on my bedroom floor.</utterance>

   <speaker>WOMAN COP</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Her coat opens as she puts her hands on her hips. A service revolver is clipped to her belt. She squints at Corky, her head nodding in recognition.</context>

   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She opens the sink cabinet and pulls out a pair of channel locks from her back pocket. The teeth of the channel locks open and bite onto the pressure nut.</context>
      <utterance>I told Bianchinni I would take a look. Is it that sink? Violet nods.</utterance>
   <speaker>CORKY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do you have a pot or a bucket?</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She hands one down to her. Corky slides it under the curved pipe. As she works, Corky feels herself staring at Violet, at the hem of her dress curving tightly around her thighs. Water begins to trickle into the pan. The nut slides loose and Corky tips the trap. Water splashes into the pan with a soft metal "tink."</context>
      <utterance>Sure.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIOLET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Corky fishes into gray water and pulls out the earring. Violet screams, a huge smile on her face, half-falling as she tries to hug Corky.</context>

      <context>In a single motion, Corky takes hold of the back of her neck and covers Violet's open mouth with her own.

From behind the gun we watch Gino's grip yanked free, time melting away as he falls, blood bubbling from his chest, his eyes wide in disbelief. His body hits the floor and the room erupts. Roy dives, drawing his gun as Caesar continues to fire, pumping the trigger. Violet drops behind the bar as Jobnnie screams, falling towards his father. Blood spurts from Roy as two bullets hit, his gun clattering and sliding across the floor. Johnnie lunges at Caesar as Caesar turns and fires, hitting Johnnie everywhere; blood and meat spray and speckle everything around him.</context>
