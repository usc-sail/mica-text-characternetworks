      <utterance>Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?</utterance>
   <speaker>CARTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Scotch, please.</utterance>

      <utterance>Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses. Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?</utterance>

      <utterance>That's right, Harry.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Your hundred, and another hundred.</utterance>

      <utterance>No, do you really?</utterance>
   <speaker>KINNEAR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Harry looks sick.</context>
      <utterance>I'll follow that and go two hundred.</utterance>
   <speaker>KINNEAR</speaker>

   <speaker>HARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All right. Two hundred.</utterance>
   <speaker>KINNEAR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Kinnear takes a wad of notes out of his pocket. Glenda, shifts herself on the sofa.</context>
      <utterance>Ha.</utterance>
   <speaker>GLENDA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes. I met him last year.</utterance>

   <speaker>GLENDA</speaker>

      <utterance>What's that?</utterance>
   <speaker>KINNEAR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Harry sweats some more.</context>
      <utterance>That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Four hundred?</utterance>
   <speaker>KINNEAR</speaker>

      <utterance>You're not seeing me?</utterance>
   <speaker>KINNEAR</speaker>

      <utterance>No.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARRY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll see you, then.</utterance>
   <speaker>KINNEAR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Glenda speaks, but this time Carter keeps his eyes on the table. Kinnear lays out his hand — a hearts flush, queen high.</context>
      <utterance>Calling my bluff, are you, Harry? Harry nods.</utterance>
   <speaker>GLENDA</speaker>

   <speaker>KINNEAR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Kinnear leans across to pick up Harry's cards. Harry grabs them and puts them in the pack. Kinnear turns to Carter.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, come on, Harry. I haven't won, have I? Go on, you're pulling my leg.</utterance>
   <speaker>KINNEAR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How about that, Jack? Old Harry thought I was having him on.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Carter gets up from the sofa.</context>
      <utterance>Shut up.</utterance>
   <speaker>KINNEAR</speaker>

      <utterance>Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?</utterance>

   <speaker>ERIC</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Carter carries on walking to the front door. He opens it.</context>
      <utterance>He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back,  You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother,  One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  So I'm worried. I can't fight them — I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.</utterance>

      <utterance>How?</utterance>
   <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No choice. I had a visit from somebody.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Who?</utterance>
   <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Albert nods.</context>
      <utterance>And you told Brumby?</utterance>
   <speaker>CARTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Who killed Frank?</utterance>

      <utterance>Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What did you do? Albert?</utterance>
   <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nothing. What could I do?</utterance>
   <speaker>CARTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?</utterance>
   <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes. I told him.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What did he say?</utterance>
   <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They drove Frank away in a car.</context>
      <utterance>'Good.' Albert draws deeply on his cigarette.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Albert nods.</context>
      <utterance>Is that all there is?</utterance>
   <speaker>CARTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Carter takes something from his pocket. There's a loud click. It's a. knife.</context>
      <utterance>Then that's it, Albert.</utterance>

      <context>He falls to his knees.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Carter drives the knife into him with all his might.</context>
      <utterance>Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A ship's horn calls mournfully from the harbour. Albert leans back. Blood seeps from his chest. He pitches forward, twitches, and is dead.</context>
      <utterance>I know you didn't kill him.  I know you didn't.</utterance>
