      <utterance>I think there are more people here to see the Maharishi than there were to see the Dylan concert. I covered the Dylan concert ... which gave me chills. Especially when he sang "She takes just like a woman And she makes love just like a woman Yes, she does And she aches just like a woman But she breaks just like a little girl."  Up to that I guess the most charismatic event I covered was Mick's Birthday when the Stones played Madison Square Garden.</utterance>
