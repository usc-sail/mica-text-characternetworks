      <utterance>Little Denise, I say this: I mark it up and I write it down and you've been warned: "By the end of May, you will know I'm not gay." "On the fourth of June, Denise, you're gonna be lickin' my spoon." "And Come August, You Suck My Big Fat Sausage." I've SET GOALS FOR MYSELF. And what? I've said "enough is enough." Because why? She's not gonna be your pal. She's not gonna be your friend. You think she's gonna be there for you the second you need something? Think again - this fuckin' bitch Denise!  But: Listen up: That is not to say that we don't all need women as friends, 'cause we're gonna learn later on in Chapter 23 that having a couple of chick-friends laying around can come in real handy in setting Jealousy Traps. But we'll get to that. Number One</utterance>

   <speaker>DR. LANDON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda. I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --</context>
      <utterance>This is the number for Hospice.</utterance>
