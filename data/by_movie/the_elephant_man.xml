   <speaker>#1 DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Treves turns and looks down to a chocolate-covered face. He smiles at the children and Anne. Anne sees the dirty faces and begins cleaning one of them. The other daughter looks into the freak tent.</context>
      <utterance>Poppa!</utterance>
   <speaker>#2 DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Poppa... may we go in there?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She turns the girl away from the freak tent and begins cleaning her face. Her kerchief pulls and distorts the little daughter's face. Suddenly the girl sees a ring of elephants in the distance.</context>
      <utterance>Alright... Your turn.</utterance>
   <speaker>#2 DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh,look M-ummy! Elephants!</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She stands.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, elephants! We'll go see them.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNE</speaker>

   <speaker>TREVES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She takes the children off toward the elephants. Treves watches them go for a moment, then turns and we go with him into the dark freak tent. He pauses to pay admission at a small booth, then disappears within. DARKNESS. We hear what could be the trumpeting of an elephant. Treves parts the black canvas and enters the main part of the tent. Off to his left he sees a man wrapped in a black cape, holding a conch shell aloft and blowing powerfully into it. The tent is dimly lit with flickering oil lamps. People mill about through the weaving corridors. To Treves' right, he sees a sign reading, "The Deadly Fruit of the Original Sin," over a small, very dark corridor. Treves enters the passage and disappears into the shadows. The corridor has a series of flaps and turns to disorient the spectator. Treves carefully pushes his way through and arrives at the inner chamber. In a roped-off space stands a small stage set at eve-level, with curtains on three sides. On the stage is a bell jar filled with grey-murky fluid lit from behind with casts an eerie glow in the chamber. Suspended in the fluid is the life-sized body of a baby-doll with the attached head of a large snake. At the join of head and body is a blob of unidentifiable organic matter. It is obviously phony, but the effect is still very disquieting. At the bottom of the jar, in the muck, sits an apple with two large bites out of it. Behind the jar is a painting on the order of a religious triptych, portraying Adam on one side, Eve on the other, and the tree flowering over the jar. Treves' impassive face is bathed in the watery glow. He studies the strange object with a critical eye. In the passage we hear movement, and an OLDER GENTLEMAN enters. He seems visibly impressed with "The Deadly Fruit of the Original Sin."</context>
      <utterance>I'll join you shortly.</utterance>
   <speaker>OLDER MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>After a moment, Treves quietly leaves the inner chamber. As he pushes his way through the corridor, the noise grows and becomes a cacophony of strange sounds. He exits and hears a booming roar and the rush of air as a series of twelve candles, mounted in a row on a ten-foot stand, are blown out by "THE INCREDIBLE WIND-MAN." His BARKER steps up and talks to the people.</context>
      <utterance>A wicked birth...</utterance>
   <speaker>BARKER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A few people raise their hands. The Barker scans the crowd and then points over the heads of the volunteers to TWO MEN toward the back.</context>
      <utterance>Ladies and Gentlemen, his lungs are larger than this mammoth blacksmith's bellows. So great is his power of exhalation, rivaling even that of the Great North Wind, that he will now challenge two grown men to attempt to hold the bellows shut as he applies the mighty blast of his herculean breath! Are there any volunteers?</utterance>
   <speaker>BARKER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>During the above, The Incredible Wind-Man removes his cape, revealing his great barrel chest and pot-belly supported by spindly, white, hairless legs. As the Barker sets the "Volunteers," the Wind-Man walks about the small platform, huffing and puffing and blowing on the conch shell. The "Volunteers" set, the Wind-Man steps up to the end of the bellows, takes an enormous breath, and twirls his black handlebar moustache as a signal to the Barker.</context>
      <utterance>Ah! I see two likely lads! Come forward! Come forward! Pit your strength against the Mighty Wind- Man!</utterance>
   <speaker>BARKER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Gentlemen... Are you ready?</utterance>
   <speaker>THE LADS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes we are... Right... etc.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARKER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Wind-Man clamps his mouth to the bellows, and with great show begins to exhale, savagely stamping his feet. The Two Lads struggle obviously, and then pretend to be forced apart. The Barker triumphantly lifts the Wind-Man's hand. The Wind- Man ceases to blow, removes his lips from the bellows and the Two Lads instantly collapse together on the floor.</context>
      <utterance>Ladies and Gentlemen!... Let the demonstration begin!!</utterance>

   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Treves moves closer to see a FAT LADY seated in a chair on the next platform. On each knee she holds a DWARF. They are dressed as babies. A SKELETON MAN stands beside her.</context>
      <utterance>Oh yes they are, they're yours alright. We hear the laughter of a crowd.</utterance>
   <speaker>SKELETON MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The crowd laughs uproariously.</context>
      <utterance>I refuse to believe it! I will not accept it! Those babies are simply too ugly, they cannot be mine!</utterance>

      <utterance>Darling, don't be difficult! Let's take our sweet lovely children on an outing.</utterance>
   <speaker>SKELETON MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>From the direction the Bobbies have gone, we hear several screams.</context>
      <utterance>We'll take these miserable whelps on an outing, alright! We'll take them to the zoo... WHERE THEY WILL STAY!</utterance>
   <speaker>FAT LADY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The two Dwarves get down from her knees and approach the Skeleton Man. They kneel and tug at his thin legs.</context>
      <utterance>Children save yourselves! Prevail upon your Pappa!</utterance>
   <speaker>DWARVES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>At this point, a FATHER holding his YOUNG SON in his arms passes by Treves. The Young Boy clutches his Father's neck in fear, hiding his face.</context>
      <utterance>Poppa! Poppa! Poppa, please!</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Treves is just about to see whatever it is that is causing the alarm, when one of the Bobbies says:</context>
      <utterance>Beast, Beast...</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As the curtain drops, Treves just glimpses baggy trouser cuffs and two horribly deformed, root-like feet. The distraught Woman has been pulled away from the Owner and is sobbing on a Bobby's shoulder.</context>
      <utterance>No! That's right out! Drop the curtain!</utterance>
   <speaker>OWNER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You can't do that! I've got my rights!</utterance>
   <speaker>ALDERMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>In the crowd, Treves notices a YOUNG BOY staring open-mouthed, blankly at the curtain. Treves pushes through the glut of people to join the Boy and get a better view. The curtain is actually a large canvas. On it is a life-sized portrait, crudely painted, of a creature that could only be possible in a nightmare. It is the figure of a man turning into an elephant. The transformation, however, is not complete; there is still more of the man than beast. Palm trees in the background suggest the jungle habitat in which this Perverted object might have once roamed. Filled with curiosity, Treves moves toward the curtain.</context>
      <utterance>I have the authority to close you down, and I'm doing just that!</utterance>
   <speaker>ALDERMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This exhibit degrades all who see it, as well as the poor creature himself.</utterance>
   <speaker>OWNER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's a freak! How else can he live?</utterance>
   <speaker>ALDERMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The alderman turns and leaves the tent.</context>
      <utterance>Freaks are one thing. No one objects to freaks, but this is entirely different. This is monstrous, and ought not to be allowed. These officers will see to it that you are on your way as soon as possible. Good day.</utterance>
   <speaker>OWNER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Now at the canvas, Treves tries to lift the edge to get a peek inside the wagon, but the meaty hand of the Owner clamps down on his wrist.</context>
      <utterance>...Movin' again! He shakes his head in disgust.</utterance>
   <speaker>OWNER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The two men look at each other for a solid moment.</context>
      <utterance>Have a care, guv'nor.</utterance>
   <speaker>TREVES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Treves backs away and returns his gaze to the painted canvas.</context>
      <utterance>Forgive me...</utterance>

      <context>The two medical Students come forward. They stare uneasily at the gaping wound, which bubbles each time the man takes an agonized breath. Treves and Fox quickly and expertly tend the wound as Hodges and Pierce look on.</context>
      <utterance>Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Of course you do realize that medicine has changed quite a bit since your father's time. In those days we didn't even wash our coats. In fact, the sign of a truly accomplished surgeon-- was his black operating coat, so stiff with dried blood and pus that it could stand up by itself in the corner. I've still got mine upstairs... You don't mind blood, do you?</utterance>

      <context>AERIAL SHOT from third floor of the London Hospital looking down on the hospital square. Below, Treves is walking briskly across the square, through a gate and into the slums beyond. The aerial shot is actually FOX'S POV, and now we see Fox filled with curiosity, watching the figure from a window. Looking down from above and to the side of him, we follow Treves walking through a cobblestone street still wet from a recent rain, covered with horse manure and filth of all sorts. The air is smoky from meat burning fires. Rounding a corner, we see and approach the painted canvas sign of "The Elephant Man" covering the front of a small, dingy shop. The door of the shop is windowless and padlocked. Treves walks into the picture, studies the whole scene for a moment, goes to the shop door and finds that it is padlocked. Treves tries to look under an edge of the canvas. To his left he sees a SMALL BOY watching him intently.</context>
      <utterance>Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.</utterance>
   <speaker>TREVES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He holds a coin out. The Boy nods, snatches the coin and then disappears around the corner. Treves turns back to the canvas.</context>

   <speaker>BOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The figure comes forward and lets the blanket fall to the ground and we see the ELEPHANT MAN himself. Treves, his eyes wide with horror and wonder, his mouth frozen open, steps backward in an instinctive movement of self preservation. The Owner laughs. The Elephant Man is naked to the waist, his feet are bare and he wears a pair of worn trousers from a fat man's dress suit. He is a little below average height, and looks shorter from the bowing of his back. His head is enormous and misshapen, as big around as a man's waist. From his brow projects a huge boney mass, almost obscuring his right eye. His nose is a nose of flesh, recognizable only from its position. From the upper jaw projects another mass of bone protruding from the mouth like a stump, turning the upper lip inside out, making a slobbering aperture. It almost gives the impression of a rudimentary trunk or tusk. On top of his head is a handful of lank, black hair. At the back of it hangs a bag of spongy skin, resembling cauliflower. These loathsome growths cover his back and hang down to the middle of his thighs. The right arm is enormous and shapeless, the hand like a knot of tuberous roots. His left arm is not only normal, but delicately shaped, with fine skin and a hand that any woman might envy. From his chest hangs another bag of flesh, like the dewlap of a lizard. His legs are also grossly deformed, his feet great stumps. Behind him, as painted in the portrait, are two crudely constructed palm trees. The Owner harshly raps again.</context>

   <speaker>BOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Elephant Man completes his turn and comes to rest. We see a CLOSE-UP of the Elephant Man looking at Treves. His face is utterly devoid, and incapable, of expression. We see the Elephant Man's eyes. He closes them.</context>

      <context>Treves, facing the street, drinks in the fresh air. He is trying to forget his shock, put everything into focus. He looks at the garish portrait again. Treves produces his purse. The Owner, smelling money, turns. Treves hands him several coins.</context>

      <utterance>My name is Frederick Treves... I am a surgeon here at the London Hospital, and I lecture in anatomy at the Medical College... I would very much like to examine you. Would that be all right?</utterance>

      <utterance>He is English, he is twenty-one years of age and his name is John Merrick. Gentlemen, in the course of my profession I have come upon lamentable deformities of the face due to injury or disease, as well as mutilations and contortions of the body, depending upon like causes; but, at no time have I met with such a dreaded or perverted version of a human being as this man. I wish to draw your attention to the insidious conditions affecting this patient. Note, if you will, the extreme enlargement of the skull... and upper limb, which is totally useless. The alarming curvature of the spine... Turn him, please... the looseness of the skin, and the varying fibrous tumors that cover 90% of the body.</utterance>
   <speaker>TREVES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Treves nods to the Assistants and they go to the Elephant Man. We see them in shadow untying the loose knot of the loin cloth. CLOSE-UP of the shadow of the head of the Elephant Man. It goes up for a breath.</context>
      <utterance>...And there is every indication that these afflictions have been in existence, and have progressed rapidly, since birth. The Patient also suffers from chronic bronchitis. As an interesting side-note, in spite of the afore-mentioned anomalies, the patient's genitals remain entirely intact and unaffected.</utterance>
   <speaker>TREVES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So then, gentlemen, owing to this series of deformities: The congenital exostoses of the skull; extensive papillomatous growths and large pendulous masses in connection with the skin; the great enlargement of the right upper limb, involving all the bones; the massive distortion of the head and the extensive areas covered by papillomatous growth, the patient has been called, "The Elephant Man."</utterance>

At her touch, he is instantly subdued, at least physically. He sinks back into the tub and begins to weep. Treves and Mothershead are astounded by the tears rolling down Merrick's cheeks.

      <utterance>I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?</utterance>

      <utterance>I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man...

      <utterance>Forgive the redundancy, gentlemen, but there is no other place for him. Both the Royal Hospital and the British Home have turned him down even if sufficient funds for his care were provided. The workhouse is certainly out of the question. The patient has an overwhelming fear of returning to the horrors of his past. His appearance is so disturbing that all shrink from him. He cannot, in justice to others, be put in the general ward of the workhouse. The police rightly prevent his being exhibited, and he is mobbed in the streets wherever he goes.

      <utterance>Gentlemen, John Merrick is not an animal, he is a man, fully aware of his condition. An intelligent, sensitive, literate man, with an intimate knowledge of the Bible. His horrible infirmities do not reduce him to anything less than what he is, a man; and it would be criminal if we of the London Hospital, his final refuge, the last place on earth where this man can find peace, were to cast him out.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Carr Gomm and another committee member raise their hands. Broadneck is displeased.</context>
      <utterance>Gentlemen, may I make a suggestion. There are two small rooms off Bedstead Square that are no longer in use and would be admirably suited to Mr. Merrick's needs. I also propose to write a letter to The Times, appealing to their readers for assistance. Knowing the generosity of the British public, I feel we would have little trouble in raising the funds for his maintenance. Indeed, this hospital's rules do preclude the admission of incurables, but if ever there was an exception to the rule, it is this patient. So therefore, I propose, if Mr. Treves is finished, that we put it to a vote. All those in favor of keeping Mr. Merrick here?</utterance>
   <speaker>BROADNECK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>One moment,  as far as I'm concerned this creature has no business being in our hospital. I think Mr. Carr Gomm's letter would be an excellent idea,  and when you appeal for funds, I think you should appeal for a more appropriate place for him as well. I agree the British public is generous, and I'm sure that somewhere the creature will find a happy and permanent home, but not here. One of the committee members says "I quite agree". Carr Gomm scowls a bit.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Carr Gomm raises his hand. None of the others do. Treves and Carr Gomm exchange hopeless glances. Carr Gomm looks at the man who had originally raised his hand. He looks away, ashamed.</context>
      <utterance>I see. All, then, that move we keep Mr. Merrick here?</utterance>
   <speaker>CARR</speaker>

   <speaker>BROADNECK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Carr Gomm cannot conceal his contempt.</context>
      <utterance>Well then. In the meantime, of course, he needn't be turned out. He may stay in the rooms off Bedstead Square until such time as more suitable arrangements can be made, thus freeing the Isolation Ward for more deserving patients. Well then, Mr. Chairman, if there is nothing further to discuss, I move that we adjourn this meeting and all go bout our normal business.</utterance>

      <context>Anne manages a smile, comes down the stairs and together they go into the sitting room. Merrick is examining everything in the room. Nothing in this almost magical world escapes his attention. The furniture, the personal mementoes, particularly the pictures on the fireplace.

      <utterance>Yes, we do have a lot of room. But you should see the place on weekends, when I see patients here. Sometimes there are so many, we have to set them down wherever we can. In fact, Mrs. Treves sometimes says that the only room she can call her own is the bedroom.</utterance>

      <utterance>She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.</utterance>

      <context>At this, Anne is so extremely touched that she begins to cry. She tries to hold it in, but to no avail. She reaches a hand out to Merrick and he takes it. He tries to comfort her.</context>
      <utterance>If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.</utterance>

      <utterance>It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.</utterance>

   <speaker>MERRICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Merrick, embarrassed by these last words, starts to close the book. Mrs. Kendal knows Juliet's lines by heart. She looks at Merrick for a moment, then replies tenderly.</context>
      <utterance>Romeo and Juliet. I know of this... "If I profane with my unworthiest hand, This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand, To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss."</utterance>
   <speaker>KENDAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Merrick pauses, looking at Kendal, then continues.</context>
      <utterance>Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmer's kiss.</utterance>
   <speaker>MERRICK</speaker>

      <context>They both look at each other for a long, silent moment. Treves is touched and amazed.</context>
      <utterance>O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.</utterance>

Quick enquiries proved it to be none other than Mr. John Merrick, The Elephant Man, with whom our readers are undoubtedly familiar. After a chat of three-quarters of an hour, Mrs. Kendal was kind enough to leave Mr. Merrick with an autographed portrait of herself. Owing to a disfigurement of the most extreme nature, Mr. Merrick has never been properly presented to London society. But knowing that wherever Mrs. Kendal goes, others inevitably follow, the questions arises: Will London society present itself to him?"</utterance>

      <context>Above Merrick's bookshelf we see a row of framed pictures of prettily smiling society women. Mrs. Kendal has started a fad. We pan slowly by them and down to Merrick's table where his Mother and Mrs. Kendal have their place of honor. The cathedral is also there. Beside it is a modest tea service. We now see a GENTLEMAN standing behind a seated LADY. They hold teacups. They are both very attractive and empty-headed, and seem on the verge of screaming. They smile at Merrick who has been talking the whole while. Merrick holds an elegant, silvertipped walking stick across his lap, and admires a ring that only fits his little finger.</context>

For the first and only time, we see expression on his face. It is a calm, knowing look, almost a benign smile. At that very moment there is a bright flash of light behind Merrick's head, seemingly from the window. Treves blinks, unable to comprehend what has just happened. When he looks again, the moment has passed. Merrick, his back to Treves, moves to the bookcase to replace the volume.</context>

I would very much like to commend you for the charitable face you have shown Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man. It is laudable that you have provided one of England's most unfortunate sons with a safe and tranquil harbour, a home. For this immeasurable kindness, as well as the many other acts of mercy on behalf of the poor, of which Mr. Carr Gomm has kept me informed, I gratefully thank you. Signed Victoria, Empress of India, Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  I am sure you gentlemen may be counted on to do the Christian thing.</utterance>

      <context>Carr Gomm raises his hand. The other members, puzzled, look at Broadneck. Quite red in the face, Broadneck looks at Carr Gomm, then to Treves, then to the Princess. He seems to almost deflate, then slowly raises his hand. The other members, now thoroughly confused, raise their hands as well. Carr Gomm bangs his gavel, smiling broadly. Treves is almost beside himself with happiness, and the Princess is obviously very pleased.</context>
      <utterance>Well then, I move that Mr. John Merrick be admitted to the London Hospital on a permanent basis, on condition that the Hospital shall receive a yearly payment equal to the cost of occupying one bed, and that the funds for his care shall be clearly separate from hospital funds.

      <context>Merrick is frozen, caught. Seeing Merrick in his outfit, the Night Porter's jaw drops. They both stare at each other. The Night Porter begins to laugh hysterically.

      <context>The Night Porter has turned Merrick and is holding him for the approaching kiss. The crowd is egging them on. The man forces the Woman closer and closer and raises her arms to force her into an embrace. As Merrick and the Woman touch, being pressed together, the Woman begins to scream. The Night Porter, the Man and the crowd all laugh with glee. Merrick and the whore now have their faces pressed together. The Whore is screaming and Merrick is crying out and screaming too.</context>

      <context>Merrick and the Whore are pushed onto Merrick's bed. The Night Porter grabs the other Whore now. She begins screaming wildly.</context>

   <speaker>NIGHT PORTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He pushes the screaming Whore down onto Merrick. Her screaming face goes right into his. Merrick tries to move away and as he does his head goes too far back and his cried turn to horrible wheezing.</context>
      <utterance>A prince needs a harem!</utterance>
   <speaker>NIGHT PORTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The crowd outside is trying to see in the window. Five or six more have gone into Merrick's room to see. All are laughing and screaming and trying to get a close look at The Elephant Man.</context>

      <context>Suddenly one of the crowd outside reaches up and grabs Merrick's good hand and pulls him half out the window. Others follow suit and haul him all the way through. The cathedral falls to the floor, breaking into several pieces. Because of the horror of touching him, the crowd outside lets Merrick fall to the ground. The Night Porter whirls around and sees that Merrick is gone. He pushes the rest of the people outside and quickly goes to Merrick, lifting him to his feet. Unseen by anyone, Bytes slips into Merrick's room. Merrick is now standing. The crowd moves in. The Night Porter is enjoying the festivities, but looks around nervously for trouble.</context>
      <utterance>Everyone outside!!!</utterance>
   <speaker>ONE MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Man grabs Merrick and pours some gin into his mouth, then pushes him away. He's caught by another man, fed liquor and pushed away. He's pushed now from person to person faster and faster. Finally Merrick falls to the ground, dizzy and a bottle of gin on Merrick's head. He coughs and moans through the wheezing. The crowd is now strangely silent circling The Elephant Man like a pack of dogs closing in on a terrified rabbit. Suddenly Merrick starts to wail. The crowd joins in and they hoist him above their heads, screaming with laughter, around and around, joining him all the while. Now we see a window reflecting the scene of terror. A curtain is pulled aside and we see through the reflection the face of the Young Porter, watching everything.</context>

   <speaker>NIGHT PORTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Merrick, alone now, hears the Night Porter's echoing footsteps and the distant sound of the gate being closed. There is a long silence as Merrick collects himself. He then leans back into his pillows with a deep sigh. His eyes close.</context>
      <utterance>Here... buy yourself a sweet. The Night Porter turns and leaves.</utterance>
   <speaker>BYTES</speaker>

      <context>Merrick's good hand comes into the frame trying to reach his mother's picture. He grabs at the table cloth and pulls. Now we see Bytes gripping Merrick's arm and pulling. We see the picture fall to the ground with a THUD.</context>

      <context>Now we see Treves filled with anger. He's got the information from the Young Porter and bolts down the hall at full speed. Mothershead, still in Merrick's room, now become activated with determination to get to the bottom of all this herself. She leaves the room. In the distance is Treves marching off. Closer to her is the Young Porter, looking worried. She calls him to her. CLOSE-UP of Treves angrily walking.</context>

Without a break, she strides over to him and with a lightning movement, boxes him soundly on the ears. The blow is staggering and makes quite a formidable sound. The Night Porter falls to the floor, barely conscious.</context>

      <context>Merrick begins a series of awkward movements, his pained version of a dance. Without his walking stick it is very difficult for him, but he strives to do it. Some of the crowd laughs at this, others shudder at the strange sight. Suddenly Merrick falters and comes to a stop, breathing irregularly. Seeing this, Bytes goes to him and bringing the stick behind Merrick, out of view of the audience, jabs him savagely in the back.</context>

      <context>Merrick looks incapable of even this simple movement, but he slowly manages to turn. The crowd reacts to the horrible condition of Merrick's back and head. Bytes satisfied that the Elephant Man is having the proper effect, raps the walking stick again.</context>
      <utterance>Turn around!</utterance>
   <speaker>BYTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Merrick's eyes look painfully up to the heavens and he begins to shuffle clumsily about the platform. Without his stick this is very difficult for him, causing him great pain. It is a humiliating spectacle and the crowd unimpressed by the halting movements of the monster begins to heckle him. Bytes seeing that the dancing isn't being received well moves to place a stool next to Merrick.</context>
      <utterance>Dance!</utterance>
   <speaker>BYTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Merrick, already exhausted by his little dance, wheezes and coughs, attempting to ascend the stool. It is useless, he is just too tired. Again the audience shouts its disapproval, booing and hissing the Elephant Man. Bytes curses and raps again, demanding obedience from Merrick who again bravely tries to mount the stool. He cannot do it! Bytes, striving to save the moment and please the angry crowd, goes to Merrick and roughly helps him up. Merrick teeters precariously on the stool. Bytes raps the stick.</context>
      <utterance>Up! Up!</utterance>
   <speaker>BYTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Merrick hesitates and Bytes bangs the stick on the wagon. The audience quiets down to hear the elephant call. Merrick senses this lull, but he is very frightened and sick. He lifts his head wearily and makes a few wavering cries that sound very little like an elephant.</context>
      <utterance>Give the call of the elephant!</utterance>
   <speaker>BYTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Merrick tries again but there is no improvement. The crowd begins to jeer at Merrick, exhorting him to make the call of the elephant. Merrick is now almost swaying on the stool. He attempts to step down, but as he does it finally becomes too much for him and he collapses into a heap on the wagon floor. The crowd is no longer in the least bit challenged by this piteous mess and they break out into a vocal fury, throwing objects at the wagon. Bytes is humiliated at first, and then is quickly angry. He turns to Merrick.</context>
      <utterance>Louder!</utterance>
   <speaker>BYTES</speaker>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>He drags Merrick across the way to a small monkey wagon. The boy follows, his face filled with sympathy for Merrick. Bytes opens the cage door and stuffs Merrick in as the monkeys scream.</context>

      <utterance>Shut up!</utterance>
   <speaker>BOY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bytes knocks the boy down with the back of his hand. He stalks to his wagon and climbs inside. After some muffled sound, Merrick's food bowl comes flying out. There are more muffled sounds as Merrick's stick, cloak and hood are also thrown out one by one.</context>
      <utterance>Bytes, please...</utterance>
   <speaker>BYTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The boy looks to Merrick who is in a panic trying to keep himself away from the monkeys who scream loudly in all the excitement. We hear Bytes, cursing to himself, in the wagon. The boy, frightened, goes to the fire and pulls a blanket around him. Merrick crawls to one corner of the cage away from the screaming monkeys. Suddenly one of the braver ones leaps at Merrick with a scream, biting him on the arm, and moving quickly away. Merrick yelps with pain and struggles to move away. The other monkeys have gotten the idea now and they begin to move warily toward Merrick, screeching threateningly. Another leaps out and clings to Merrick's shoulder, biting and scratching furiously then he too jumps away. Merrick cries out. Now the monkeys are getting braver and more and more of them lash out at Merrick with their paws. They jump onto him with savage screams, biting him on the head and neck and shoulders. Merrick's eyes search for escape. The monkeys come on and on without a break, screaming madly all the while. With his good hand Merrick begins to pull himself up with the aid of a bar. The monkeys strive to pull him down. Merrick looks through the bars at the wagon and screams frantically.</context>
      <utterance>Out!</utterance>
   <speaker>MERRICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But Bytes won't come. Something is happening inside Merrick. A wave of feeling is growing, coming from a place in him very deep down and far away. This feeling seems to give him strength and he is able to pull himself all the way up in spite of the hairy moving mass that now seems to cling to every part of his body. The feeling is surging up inside Merrick making his body shake uncontrollably as if he were a volcano about to erupt. The monkeys keep on biting and screeching, pulling at him. Suddenly a formidable cry rings out of Merrick's mouth, with a power and assurance we have never heard from him before. He whirls about and cries out again a shattering "No", the force of which scatters most of the monkeys away from him onto the cage floor, dumbfounded. Merrick grabs a monkey who has managed to hang and throws it into the group of monkeys on the floor.</context>

      <context>He looks to the lion-faced man and speaks to him in a foreign tongue. The lion-faced man unlatches the cage door. Then, after further instruction, from the plumed dwarf, the freaks gently help Merrick out of the cage, closing the door behind him. The dwarf speaks to the others again and the lion-faced man and the armless wonder move to each side of Merrick. The lion-faced man pulls Merrick's right arm over his shoulder. Merrick puts his left arm around the armless wonder.</context>

      <context>He and the other dwarf light two lanterns and they begin to move off. The boy by the wagon has awakened. He sees the small caravan of freaks moving in the darkness, the light from the lanterns bobbing over the grass. His first instinct is to call for Bytes, which he almost does, but then he thinks better of it. He rises and goes to where Bytes threw Merrick's stick and disguise. He nicks them up and goes to the small band of strangely shaped beings. They stop and watch him warily.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>The small band moves away through the wagons. The boy watches the lantern light receding in the darkness. He turns and looks to the wagon, the poster of the Elephant Man, and the dying fire. He moves to the fire quickly collecting a few blankets and belongings. Then taking one last look at the garish poster just visible in the night, he runs off into the darkness.</context>

The Plumed Dwarf, his arm around Merrick, is helping him down the platform, as fast as possible, his ark trailing behind him. As they pass the windows of the first-class carriages, we see the ornate interiors and the happy, handsome people on their plush seats.

He turns and walks in the opposite direction along a wall stacked with trunks and luggage, trying as best as he can to blend in. Little Jim gets up and moves after him. Merrick continues along the wall. A few people give him a second look, but pass on. Little Jim comes up alongside him.</context>

Relishing the hunt, the boys follow him, taunting him all the way. As they approach the arch, Little Jim, determined now, steps in front of him cutting him off. Merrick comes to an abrupt standstill, shrinking from the boy. Little Jim reaches up to the hood and grasps it firmly.</context>

   <speaker>LITTLE JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He lifts the hood and then staggers back onto the floor in a spasm of fear. He lets out a shrill scream. Merrick turns wildly away, looking for another escape. Little Jim's Mother, hearing her son's cries, looks up immediately. She sees Merrick and the howling boy in the middle of the station.</context>

      <context>Merrick, hearing this, looks in her direction and whirls away. He stumbles toward another archway exit. People, hearing the noise, watch him go.

      <context>Merrick stops at the sight of the bobby. The bobby at the arch, now aware of the commotion, sees Merrick and walks quickly towards him. Merrick changes course, but, a group of men, alerted by Jim's mother's screams, move forward together, cutting him off. They yell at him angrily. One of them darts toward him and grabs a hold of Merrick's hood. Merrick turns frantically away and as he does, the hood is pulled off him. The crowd shouts at him as he goes, following him in wary pursuit. He moves back past the children and Jim's Mother. They all scream and shield themselves from his approach. Another group of people move toward him blocking all escape. Behind him, he sees a door to a urinal. He moves through it followed by the crowd. We hear fearsome echoes inside. Inside the urinal, the crowd presses Merrick toward a wall. They have become angry now. They shout and there is fear in their voices. They hem Merrick in. He looks around hoping for an opening. There is none. He gives a strangled cry and collapses as the bobby pushes his way through the crowd. Merrick puts his good hand over his good ear trying to block out the screams of the crowd.</context>

      <utterance>Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?</utterance>
   <speaker>TREVES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, John, not one that I can see.</utterance>
   <speaker>MERRICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then I shouldn't change anything?</utterance>
   <speaker>TREVES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The two look at each other silently.</context>
      <utterance>No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.</utterance>
   <speaker>MERRICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Merrick rises and goes with Treves to the door.</context>
      <utterance>...I'll walk you to the door.</utterance>
   <speaker>TREVES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Goodnight John. Sleep well.</utterance>
   <speaker>MERRICK</speaker>

      <context>Treves smiles at John then walks down the darkened hallway. Merrick watches him for a moment, then slowly shuts the door. We hear the distant echo of Treves footsteps. Merrick goes back to examine his cathedral, looking at it from different angles. He picks up a fine brush, dipping it into the paint, and makes a few final brush strokes. He moves back into the middle of the room and gazes at it for a long time. He lowers the brush to his side.</context>
      <utterance>You too, my friend. Goodnight.</utterance>
   <speaker>MERRICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The cathedral is a masterwork of detail and shading, as if it were St. Philips itself shrunk to a miniature. He goes to the table, dips the brush into the paint and carefully signs his name at the base of the main spire.</context>
      <utterance>It is finished.</utterance>
   <speaker>MERRICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He sighs deeply, lays the brush down on the table and pushes the model towards the window. The movement causes him pain. He puts his left hand up and feels the back of his head. Merrick turns out the lamp and goes to his bed. He looks at the cathedral again, then around at his room. We see in the dim light his books, his gallery of smiling women, his dressing bag, his cloak and hood, and finally his mother's picture on the table. A slight breeze billows the curtains. We move in very close to them.</context>
      <utterance>John... Merrick!</utterance>

      <context>A lacy curtain has taken the place of the sky. The elephants seem to be moving on it... into the distance.</context>

      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Knock, knock sound. The curtain moves to one side wiping the elephants away with it. There is no terrified audience behind the curtain. There is only light and Merrick's Mother smiling a calm and benign smile.</context>

      <context>The light grows brighter and brighter until we cannot see John's Mother anymore. It almost blinds us.</context>
