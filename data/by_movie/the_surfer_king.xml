      <context>They do a hand slap maneuver that they have obviously worked out some time in the past. JAFFA proceeds up to the Customer Relations Kiosk, plops the box on the counter, and enters the kiosk. We see him open the box, it is full of CD's. He pulls winter covers off of an overhead area to reveal a CD player and amplifiers. He starts pushing buttons he's pushed a thousand times, and lights come on. He pulls down a microphone, and clicks a button to see if it works. He reaches into the box of CDs and pulls one out. We see it is Sheryl Crow. He gets the CD, examines it, and pops it into the CD player. He once again picks the microphone and flips the switch as he pushes the "play" button on the CD player. His voice echoes through the park. "Soak up the Sun" begins playing.</context>

      <context>THE COLONEL looks over his paperwork.</context>
      <utterance>Well, it looks like we have a good staff here. Yes...yes a good staff. It will be an excellent summer. Remember as we go through training today, our park is judged by the work WE do. If we do it well, the people come back.  We have a little tradition here on the grounds crew. Rather than having to learn a lot of names, many of which I can never hope to pronounce properly, each grounds crew member gets a grounds crew nickname. You will be known by that nickname in every way except, of course, your paycheck and employee records.</utterance>
   <speaker>THE COLONEL</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>EDDIE smiles knowingly. This has been his grounds crew nickname for the last 8 years, mostly because he would never answer to anything else, and THE COLONEL gave up trying.</context>
      <utterance>Let's see, what do we have? Hmm...yes. OK, first up is Eddie Cochran. Your grounds crew nickname will be.....Eddie!</utterance>
   <speaker>THE COLONEL</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>EDDIE is beaming with pride now. THE COLONEL pulls a brand new toilet plunger from the cart nearby and hands it to EDDIE. EDDIE shoulders it as if it were a rifle. THE COLONEL walks down the line.</context>
      <utterance>Now crewmembers, listen up. Eddie here has eight years experience on the grounds crew. Why, I'd like to think there isn't anything, any situation that Eddie hasn't faced. Listen to him. Learn from him. Watch what he does. This man is the finest, most conscientious grounds crewman we've ever had.</utterance>
   <speaker>THE COLONEL</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>It is all ROBBIE can do not to laugh. THE COLONEL goes on to the next kid, SKEETER who is tall, skinny and goofy-looking. SKEETER'S eyes are faced forward, but something catches them. His eyes follow an unseen object as we begin to hear a small mosquito. Finally his eyes follow it until he looks, cross eyed at his own nose. THE COLONEL has taken note of this and is following it too. SKEETER can take no more, and brushes it off his nose as he makes a face.</context>
      <utterance>Let's see...Clark? Hmmm. Your grounds crew nickname will be....Sparky.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>THE COLONEL steps over the cart and gets another new plunger and hands it to SKEETER who follows EDDIE's lead. Next in line is a short, chubby lad, SNITCH. As THE COLONEL approaches him, a quick sound of passing gas is heard. THE COLONEL is startled, and SNITCH makes a quick finger motion indicating the culprit is SKEETER, next to him.</context>

ROBBIE has picked up the sugar packets and ALEX is dancing and quickly (almost casually) tossing silverware/napkin rolls to ROBBIE as ROBBIE catches them (at first with some difficulty) and puts them on the tables. SARAH has re-stacked the cups, and is juggling salt &amp; pepper shakers, placing them on the tables. AUDREY chops onions to the beat.</context>

SKEETER is looking down at the grate where THE WAVE water drains. He reaches down and pulls something out, and turns to the WAVE BABE walking away.</context>

SKEETER waves his hand in front of SNITCH's face. No reaction. He's never seen a naked girl before. We're back to ALEX and ROBBIE.</context>

Realizing she is no longer safely in a tube she screams and begins splashing as if drowning. A guard nearby blows a single tweet of her whistle. IN SLOW MOTION we see four other guards throughout the area turn and react to the whistle. They begin running, BAYWATCH style towards the scene.</context>

      <context>Two guards are running and carrying a backboard. They converge in another BAYWATCH style slow-mo shot and line up along the edge of the splashdown pool. One guard in the middle has a rescue tube, and, still in slow motion, squats down slowly as if to jump in and rescue the girl. At the low end of the jump crouch, however he stops. WE SEE his face in close-up as he says.</context>

      <context>Mahalo and Aloha. This song is sung on my island for all young people in love...or about to be. Is called E O'Mai, or, You Are Mine. AOKEE begins singing the Hawaiian love song, "E O'Mai". Many couples are dancing; it is a slow song. ALEX, of course, is a goof. He dances slow, but every once in a while executes a deep dip, much to AMY's terror. EDDIE is off to the edge of the dance floor, watching, longingly, and kind of swaying to the music. A couple of girls walk by and he does a magic trick for them. He holds both hands up, palms open to show he has nothing in his hands. He also gestures that he has no sleeves (he is wearing a tuxedo t-shirt). He reaches behind his back and pulls out a trick bouquet of flowers, but they don't quite open right, and are still unfolding as he holds them. EDDIE smiles weakly, he knows that isn't quite how it was supposed to go. The girls appear encouraging, but as they leave look at each other and giggle. We pick up ROBBIE and KATIE dancing.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>They continue to dance. WE SEE BIG MIKE talking to TIFFANY and gesturing broadly. TIFFANY is clearly not agreeing with what he is saying. COWBOY is nowhere to be seen. Suddenly she throws up her hands and marches over to the dance floor where EDDIE is standing alone, swaying a bit to the music. She whispers something in his ear, and EDDIE'S eyes get real big as she leads him by the hand to the middle of the dance floor. She wraps her arms around EDDIE and they dance, all the while glaring at her father. EDDIE knows a good thing when he sees it, and quickly settles in, Big Man on Campus. TIFFANY is taller than he is, so he happily puts his head on HER shoulder. BIG MIKE looks back at them, not happy with the way it happened, but satisfied. DOUG FITZGERALD (twenty bucks DOUG) is dancing with a girl when ALEX, doing some kind of fancy spin to AMY, bumps into him.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>They allow their brooms to fall to their right side and march to the trash cans. They pull out bright blue ski masks, a la BLUE MAN GROUP, and pick up the toilet plungers. The lead marcher holds his plunger high and shouts.</context>

   <speaker>LEAD MARCHER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He counts a four beat rhythm and they begin a BLUE MAN/STOMP like drum routine with the trash cans.</context>

   <speaker>LEAD MARCHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Two grounds kids in regular grounds uniforms approach holding steel trash can lids by the handles (with gloves). These become drums as well as two of the drummers switch from trash can to can lids using the stick side of the toilet plunger as the drumstick. A competition erupts from the left and right sides of the line as they each set a beat and then the other matches. Finally, a show of unity as both sides join back into the beat for an ending flourish. They pick up their brooms and turn their attention to the kids behind them. They begin to march in place and the seated grounds kids clap for the tempo.</context>

      <context>They clap and cheer, and settle back down to sit. All is quiet now. WE SEE concessions kids sitting, grounds kids sitting and we look to the west side of the pool and see lifeguards sitting. Everyone is looking around. Suddenly two lifeguards dressed as Roman Soldiers appear with horns. They bellow a Roman Call to Action, and two Roman drummers lead a column of other lifeguards.</context>

   <speaker>GROUNDS KIDS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>First we see female guards dressed in togas filing in. Behind them are six gladiators with swords and shields, marching. They are followed by one female lifeguard with a basket of rose petals. She is throwing them into the path of the next group to enter. Next we see six more guards dressed as slaves carrying COWBOY, who is sitting up on a First Aid backboard. HE is wearing laurel leaves and a toga, he is obviously Cesar. On the backboard is also the surfer king trophy. They all approach the area in front of the seated guards, and rearrange themselves so that COWBOY has a good view of the gladiators. The drummers count a cadence that sets the pace for a simulated battle between the gladiators. The simulated battle rages until three of the gladiators are on their knees before the three victorious gladiators. The victorious gladiators hold their swords over the fallen ones, and look to COWBOY for a yea or nay. COWBOY generously waves and makes a thumbs up signal, and the swords are put away. The seated lifeguards all raise their fists and shout.</context>

      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>MELINDA grabs her board and begins paddling out. The wave comes and it's all she can do to stay on her board. She struggles and falls at the end. She will clearly not be a factor. The big screen shows a 0 in a column after the grounds score. We look back to the bleachers to polite applause, but the COLONEL and the grounds kids are clearly disappointed. COWBOY is out there now, the wave comes and he catches it easily. He rides the wave gracefully and well, and kicks out at the end. The big screen shows an 8 in the lifeguard row. The lifeguards and RICHARD are cheering now. ROBBIE is next. He catches the wave and rides it more aggressively than COWBOY, but nearly falls at the end of his run. The big screen shows an 8. The concessions kids and AOKEE are very enthusiastic. They can see they have a chance with ROBBIE. PIPEMAN is watching from a far corner. MELINDA begins her second run. She is a little more confident this time, but still seems barely able to stand and ride the wave. More polite applause, and the big screen shows a 5. COWBOY catches his wave, and tries to imitate ROBBIE'S more aggressive style, but falls midway through the run. We hear a large gasp from the crowd as this happens. The crowd applauds politely, and the guards are supportive but disappointed. We see the JUDGES confer and the big screen shows a 0. ROBBIE gets his wave, and surfs it aggressively again, this time not nearly falling at all. The JUDGES nod approvingly and confer. The big screen shows a 9. The crowd goes wild, especially the concessions kids. Melinda begins her final run. She does better than the past two, but not significantly. The JUDGES confer and the screen shows a 5. The ground kids are very disappointed, they know they are out of it now. THE COLONEL shakes MELINDA'S hand and thanks her for her efforts.</context>

      <context>COWBOY gets his wave, and has clearly decided to go back to his original style; he rides the wave gracefully, but takes no chances. He kicks out at the end with a wave and a smile. The guards applaud, hoping to make it seem better than it was, and the JUDGES confer and the screen shows an 8. ROBBIE snags his wave and rides it aggressively again, but loses his balance momentarily. It costs him; the JUDGES confer and the screen shows a 7. The concessions kids applaud, and the point totals show "Grounds 98", "Concessions 102" and "Lifeguards 102". EVERYONE is confused, there has never been a tie before. THE JUDGES Are flipping through papers, and BIG MIKE steps up to the microphone.</context>

      <utterance>Reading from the rules, "...in the event of a tie at the end of three heats in the surf competition, the teams who are tied will participate in a sudden-death surf off.

      <utterance>We gotta pull the fin. What do we do about the foot pockets?</utterance>
   <speaker>ROBBIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>PIPEMAN reaches into his tool belt and pulls out a roll.</context>
      <utterance>You got duct tape?</utterance>

   <speaker>PIPEMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Platinum! Where do you want them? They place the board on a table. ROBBIE pulls off two small pieces of tape and places them on the board.</context>

   <speaker>ROBBIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>PIPEMAN gets his screw gun out of his tool belt and begins removing the two outer fins of the board. He then begins looping duct tap around the board to create two foot pockets. This provides a background to the dialog below.</context>

   <speaker>AOKEE</speaker>

      <utterance>So, help me understand. What you do now?</utterance>
   <speaker>ROBBIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Pipeman is taking the extra fins off my board. I only need one to make a deep cut back. He is also putting some pockets to slip my feet into so when I flip upside down, I don't lose the board.</utterance>

      <context>AOKEE smiles and pats him on the back. Robbie nods. They head for the bay.</context>
      <utterance>Robbie. When you do this, do this mostly for Robbie Zirpollo. But do it just a little bit for Manny Ramirez, eh?</utterance>

      <context>ROBBIE appears on the seawall holding his board and looking out first at the bay, then at the crowd. His mom, CONNIE waves, and he smiles weakly. HE sees KATIE and she looks hopeful. She hasn't given up on him completely. He smiles at her and gets into the water. He begins paddling. It seems to take forever for him to get out to the spot where he catches the wave, but he finally arrives. He sits there for a moment, collecting himself, then raises his hand to signal he is ready. The CONCESSIONS KIDS have started to chant, ROBBIE! ROBBIE! The guards are anxious, but even they can't help moving to the cadence of the chant. The wave comes and he catches it quickly, and slips his feet into the duct tape pockets. He misses one pocket at first, then gets it in. He rides it carefully and at the right moment slides up to</context>

      <context>the top and executes a full 360 degree turn out of the water. On landing back on the downside of the wave, he slides down it quickly, and then turns around with a deep cut and heads straight into the wave. At the top he bounces and does a complete back flip in slow motion. We see the crowd also in slow motion. AOKEE Is covering his eyes, he can't watch. ALEX's face is contorted with disbelief. Various faces in the crowd are in open-mouthed disbelief. THE JUDGES are staring intently, focussed so as not to miss anything. ROBBIE lands the flip, and rides the rest of the wave. He waves to the crowd, and kicks off, exhausted. The place goes nuts. No one here has ever seen anything like this before. AOKEE and ALEX run into the water and help him out. People are still cheering. COWBOY knows he's in trouble. THE JUDGES confer only momentarily and the score 10 appears, and the word concessions starts flashing along with the word winner. COWBOY nods in agreement. TIFFANY says something to him, and he appears angry. We can only hear part of his response, something like:</context>

      <context>AOKEE and ALEX lead him up to the grandstand. COWBOY also makes his way up there, and we see him talking to BIG MIKE. BIG MIKE nods in agreement and COWBOY goes to the mike as the crowd settles down.</context>
