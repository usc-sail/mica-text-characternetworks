Drop of a hat? They'll rock and roll. Also: the way they went into the side indicates they are equipped to go in on the prowl.

Now Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life and become a born- again good citizen. So, he's revealed the key player is this cowboy Waingro. Used to be part of Neil's crew. Waingro committed a double murder today on Towner, a driver, and his old lady.  Meanwhile Waingro's checked into the Airport Hyatt House under "Jamieson." Maybe Neil will make a move on him, but not likely.  Get the word to bailbondsmen, bookies, snitches in County, etc. where Waingro is. And get a team down there to set it up.</utterance>
