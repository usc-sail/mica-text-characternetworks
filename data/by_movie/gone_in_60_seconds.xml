      <context>And Atley drives off slowly, Memphis looks this way and that ... No one about ... He removes a SLIM JIM from a deep pocket in his coat... He slims the door panel ... Pops the button ... opens the door ... Watch him work. Quick as shit. A SCREWDRIVER appears another pocket ... He pops the BUTTERFLY to the IGNITION A RATCHET appears... He strips the mechanism... Now a GIZMO - a,small socket-like device - is pressed into the ignition ... A twist of the wrist ... And the 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles like a jackhammer. The whole thing took 20 seconds. He takes a cassette TAPE from another pocket ... Slaps it into the deck. Bruce Springsteen's "Ramrod" wails from the coaxials. And Memphis floors it... And off they tear... The look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction ... A grand re-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers ... A speed Jones, fixed and fumy ... He slots in behind Atley Jackson's Firebird ... And slotting in behind Memphis, in a Z-28, is DONNY ASTRICKY, mid-30s ... On they go ... The fore and aft car providing escort... Except that, from seemingly out of nowhere --</context>
      <utterance>You gonna steal her or kneel down to her and pray -- ? Memphis looks at him, still enthralled... ATLEY JACKSON  I know, I know ... It's Eleanor ... Just take her, slick. - -</utterance>
   <speaker>A POLICE CAR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic ... He races through a STOP SIGN ... And the cruiser's bubbles flash on ... And Donny is pulled-over ... Atley and Memphis drive on in their respective vehicles... The UNIFORM COP gets out of his car, goes to Donny.</context>
      <utterance>appears behind them...</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>And off of Donny's look -- We go to Memphis in the Shelby... As FOUR CRUISERS comes speeding toward him, sirens wailing... QUICK SHOTS of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early morning harbor town streets ... Sirens peel ... Memphis turns up the music ... Pins the gas ... The chase is on ... Memphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb... Memphis gutterballing the car, skating the shoulder, the cops in heavy pursuit ... And now he's picked up another CRUISER... He passes Atley Jackson, heading in the opposite direction... Atley has picked-up a pair of cruisers himself ... Memphis on a straightaway now, speeds up, feels the boost. But up ahead, a ROADBLOCK has formed... How'd they get that deployed so fast? And behind him, the unmarks blaze ... Guns his bitch... Straight at the roadblock .. Three CRUISERS and a PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on to the roadblock ... And, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way, Memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake -- And the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin ... And Memphis takes the HARD LEFT ... And he's managed to outrun them... Finding himself above Lower Grand... Looking down ... He can see the secondary pursuit down below ... Atley being chased... IN THE DISTANCE - Atley is LAUNCHED FROM THE SHOULDER, the Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert ... Landing with a sickening thud on its back. Memphis is horrified.</context>

Calitri is on top, grabbing an AWL from the floor, bringing the lethal point down to Memphis' face... Memphis holds Calitri's wrist, straining, the point inches from his eye ANGLE - FLOOR SOCKET - right above Memphis' head. With a last gasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a small CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl akimbo ... Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself out inside of them... Calitri is up; and he's found the gun ... He crawls over to Memphis, climbing on him, sitting down hard on the younger man's chest ... But then Memphis grabs him by the hair and tosses Calitri off him ...
