      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Punks don't know whether to laugh or just shoot him, but it is too late for either option, as Storm suddenly spins between the Punks and behind the gun. The SHOTGUN GOES OFF and BLOWS away part of the back WALL -- BOTTLES EXPLODE -- Storm locks the Punk's fingers into the gun, rotates the gun as a bar, breaking the Punk's arm. The others make their move -- but now Storm has the shotgun and is using it as a sword or staff. He looks like a true master conductor in an almost magical manipulation. These pour stupid Punks have become the instruments in his spontaneous orchestra. Punk 2 takes a vicious swipe at Storm with his long knife. Storm ducks, goes to his knees, and uses the gun to foot- sweep the Punk. The Punk's legs fly skyward and his head slams against the floor. As soon as he hits, the shotgun is slammed through his teeth. The last Punk has produced an icepick and is staring at his compadres in disbelief. He and Storm square off.</context>

      <context>The Punk lungs, thrusting the ice pick with lightning speed at Storm's face. Storm makes a slight movement, parries the thrust and slides his body behind the Punk, simultaneously slamming his forearm into the rear knee joint. The Punk buckles and Storm now has one of his legs in both arms and pins the other leg with his left knee.</context>

O'Malley throws a fierce body block on both men, sending all three crashing into a big, loaded luggage cart. O'Malley finds his feet first as all three struggle to get up. Nolan starts to pull his gun. O'Malley grabs a heavy metallic suitcase and smashes Nolan in the face with all his strength. Nolan crashes backward against Turner, toppling them both into a huge 25-foot lighting installer's ladder -- which now starts -- to cave over, pulling a string of dozens of big industrial GLOBES plummeting to the floor and EXPLODING into thousands of tiny shards! People scream. O'Malley shoves the luggage cart at the men and races for the door --</context>

The tire iron (that's used as a jack handle) springs loose, onto the ground near O'Malley. Seeing the gunmen, Sonny in horror crawls under a car. The cab driver flees for his life. O'Malley spins back, draws and tries to fire at the oncoming Nolan and Turner -- but he is SHOT TWICE in the stomach.

      <context>There is a brief moment of hesitation and a look of disbelief between the boys and then, BOOM! Ford tries to hand Storm a pool cue as if Storm's head is a baseball and the cue is a bat. This doesn't work very well, as Storm enters and simultaneously grabs Ford's cue, using his momentum to slam his head down onto the edge of the pool table. We hear Ford's SKULL CRACK and he goes down. Almost instantly another pool cue in Jones's hands slashes toward Storm's head. This time Storm has his own tool -- and takes his cue to intercept the one about to connect with his head. He again uses the power of the attacker's momentum and as soon as his cue goes down, so does Storm's, onto the back of Jones's skull with so much force we hear the NECK SNAP at the same time the cue splinters in half! Storm is left with the jagged tip of the skinny end. Dunne, knowing he'll never make it in time to the couch at the rear of the room, lunges at Storm with a butcher knife he seizes from a tray of cold cuts on a side table. Storm traps the knife, and quickly guides it into Dunne's midsection. With the other hand he raises the sharpened end of the pool stick and slams it down Dunne's throat via the windpipe!</context>

About this time in their journey through the house, Storm has stopped before Holland's mangled and lifeless body. If you think Trent was scared before, you should see him now. Storm curiously turns his back on Trent for a moment, to pick up handcuffs off the floor. Trent sees his last chance. Trent seizes the poker and does his most mighty Babe Ruth impression. Just as Storm stands up, the poker comes flying. It looks like Storm is dead but somehow he steps inside the arc and does shihonage, which disarms Trent and flips him backwards head-first into the fire. Trent's neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron arrows of the fireplace. He is stuck -- struggling to free himself from the arrow as his head catches fire ... a fate somewhat worse than prison.</context>
      <utterance>You know, Trent, I want to kill you so bad I can barely contain myself. But I keep thinking that death is far too merciful a fate for you, and that a nice petite white-bread boy like you in a federal penitentiary ...  -- let me put it this way -- I doubt whether you could remain anal retentive for very long.
