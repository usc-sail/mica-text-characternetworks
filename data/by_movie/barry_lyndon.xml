      <utterance>My mother, after her husband's death, and her retirement, lived in such a way as to defy slander. She refused all offers of marriage, declaring that she lived now for her son only, and for the memory of her departed saint.</utterance>

      <utterance>My mother was the most beautiful women of her day. But if she was proud of her beauty, to do her justice, she was still more proud of her son, and has said a thousand times to me that I was the handsomest fellow in the world.</utterance>

      <utterance>The good soul's pleasure was to dress me; and on Sundays and Holidays, I turned out in a velvet coat with a silver-hilted sword by my side, and a gold garter at my knee as fine as any lord in the land. As we walked to church on Sundays, even the most envious souls would allow that there was not a prettier pair in the kingdom.</utterance>

      <utterance>My uncle's family consisted of ten children, and one of them was the cause of all my early troubles; this was the belle of the family, my cousin, Miss Dorothy Dugan, by name.</utterance>

      <utterance>Ah! That first affair, how well one remembers it! What a noble discovery it is that the boy makes when he finds himself actually and truly in love with some one!

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Agreed.</utterance>
   <speaker>RODERICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They line up together and start on a count of three. Dorothy uses all her strength, but Roderick holds back, and Dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of him.</context>
      <utterance>Do you see the gate at the end of the field? The first to touch it will be the winner.</utterance>
   <speaker>RODERICK</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Dorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty. Then she goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes out and says:</context>
      <utterance>I was certain to win, but I meant to lose to see what she would order me to do.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They sit down on the grass. Roderick searches her pockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then her shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and circumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears upon the knee. He unfastens them and finds nothing; he draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits. The tickling makes her laugh.</context>
      <utterance>Your penalty is to find a cherry- colored ribbon which I have hidden somewhere on my person. You are free to look for it anywhere you will, and I will think very little of you if you do not find it.</utterance>

      <utterance>About this time, the United Kingdom was in a state of great excitement from the threat generally credited of a French invasion. The noblemen and people of condition in that and all other parts of the kingdom showed their loyalty by raising regiments of horse and foot to resist the invaders. How I envied them. The whole country was alive with war's alarums; the three kingdoms ringing with military music, while poor I was obliged to stay at home in my fustian jacket and sigh for fame in secret.</utterance>
   <speaker>RODERICK</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Dorothy ignores Roderick; dances, chats, laughs, drinks punch, and finally, strolls outside with Captain Best. Roderick makes a half-hearted try at dancing with Miss Clancy.</context>
      <utterance>Once, the officers of the Kilwangen regiment gave a grand ball to which Dorothy persuaded my to take her. Several cuts depicting the evening.</utterance>
   <speaker>RODERICK</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have endured torments in my life, but none like that. Some of the prettiest girls there offered to console me, for I was the best dancer in the room, but I was too wretched, and so remained alone all night in a state of agony. I did not care for drink, or know the dreadful comfort of it in those days; but I thought of killing myself and Dorothy, and most certainly of making away with Captain Best.</utterance>
   <speaker>RODERICK</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>At last, and at morning, the ball was over.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>To this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle made no reply.</context>
      <utterance>Sure it's a bitter night, Roderick dear, and you'll catch cold without a handkerchief to your neck.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>To this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth, and giving a lash to Daisy.</context>
      <utterance>Did you and Miss Clancy have a pleasant evening, Roderick? You were together, I saw, all night.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's waist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world.</context>
      <utterance>Oh! Mercy, you make Daisy rear and throw me, you careless creature, you.</utterance>
   <speaker>RODERICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.</utterance>
   <speaker>RODERICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?</utterance>
   <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man. He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?</utterance>
   <speaker>RODERICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But you refused me, Dorothy.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh! I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner. Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.</utterance>
   <speaker>RODERICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two. I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Roderick falls silent.</context>
      <utterance>But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London. It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.</utterance>

      <context>She never finished the word for, maddened by the continual recurrence of that odious monosyllable, Roderick shouts:</context>

   <speaker>RODERICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And, giving Daisy the spur, springs with Dorothy over the parapet, into the deeper water below. The horse's head sinks under, the girl screams as she sinks, and screams as she rises. Roderick lands her, half-fainting, on the shore.</context>

      <context>Roderick see Captain Best and Dorothy pacing the path together. Her arm is under his, and he is fondling and squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling against his arm. Some distance beyond them is Captain Grogan, who is paying court to Dorothy's sister, Mysie.</context>
      <utterance>I did not stop to break his bones, as I would on another occasion, for a horrible suspicion had come across me, and I made for the garden as quickly as I could.</utterance>

      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I pulled out a knot of cherry- colored ribbons, which she had given me out of her breast, and which somehow I always wore upon me, and flung them in Captain Best's face, and rushed out with my little sword drawn.</utterance>
   <speaker>RODERICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Captain Best! Draw, sir, and defend yourself, if you are a man! Roderick leaps at Captain Best, and collars him, while Dorothy makes the air echo with her screams. Captain Grogan and Mysie hasten up. Though Roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small by the side of the enormous English captain. Best turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back clutching at his sword. Dorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him, screaming:</context>
      <utterance>She's a liar -- she's a liar,</utterance>
   <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>

   <speaker>CAPTAIN BEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>So saying, he stoops down and picks up the bunch of ribbons, which Roderick had flung at Dorothy's feet, and handing it to her, says in a sarcastic tone:</context>
      <utterance>And ought to be whipped for his impudence, but never fear, Miss Dugan, I shall not touch him, your favorite is safe from me.</utterance>

      <utterance>You are a gallant lad, and I like your spirit. But what Dugan says is true. It's a hard thing to give a lad counsel who is in such a far- gone state as you; but, believe me, I know the world, and if you will but follow my advice, you won't regret having taken it. Dorothy Dugan has not a penny; you are not a whit richer. And, my poor boy, don't you see -- though it's a hard matter to see -- that she's a flirt, and does not care a pin for you or Best either?</utterance>
   <speaker>RODERICK</speaker>

      <context>He looks hard at Roderick for a second to two, then he walks away, humming a tune, looking back at Roderick as he goes through the old gate out of the garden. When Grogan is gone, Roderick is quite alone, and he flings himself down on the bench where Dorothy had made believe to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the ribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and bursts into a passion of tears.</context>
      <utterance>Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.</utterance>

      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>

      <utterance>Captain Grogan, I beg you to understand that, for my cousin Harry, who has been my best friend through life, I could put up with rough treatment from him; yet, even that sort of treatment I will bear from him no longer; and any other person who ventures on the like will not like the cost. Mr. Best knows that fact very well; and, if he's man, he'll know where to find me.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick. Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family? Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, if it must be, it must. For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw. No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.</utterance>

      <utterance>Perhaps had I been a little older in the world's experience, I should have begun to see that Madame O'Reilly was not the person of fashion she pretended to be; but, as it was, I took all her stories for truth, and, when the landlord brought the bill for dinner, paid it with the air of a lord. Indeed, she made no motion to produce the two pieces I had lent her.</utterance>

In a foreign country, with the enemy before us, and the people continually under contribution from one side or the other, numberless irregularities were permitted to the troops. It is well for gentlemen to talk of the age of chivalry; but remember the starving brutes whom they lead -- men nursed in poverty, entirely ignorant, made to take pride in deeds of blood -- men who can have no amusement but in drunkenness, debauch, and plunder. It is with these shocking instruments that your great warriors and kings have been doing their murderous work in the world.</utterance>

If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.

      <utterance>It was very imprudent of me; but when I saw the splendor of his appearance, the nobleness of his manner, I felt it impossible to keep disguise with him. You, who have never been out of your country know little what it is to hear a friendly voice in captivity; and there's a many a man that will understand the cause of the burst of feeling which was about to take place. The Chevalier takes Roderick by the shoulder.</utterance>

      <utterance>Sir, I have a confession to make. I am an Irishman, and my name is Roderick James. I was abducted into the Prussian army two years ago, and now I have been put into your service by my Captain and his uncle, the Minister of Police, to serve as a watch upon your actions, of which I am to give information to the same quarter. For this odious service, I have been promised my discharge, and a hundred guineas.</utterance>

      <utterance>The rascals! They think to catch me, do they? Why, young man, my chief conspiracy is a faro-bank. But the king is so jealous, that he will see a spy in every person who comes to his miserable capital, in the great sandy desert here.</utterance>
   <speaker>RODERICK</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>

      <utterance>And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.</utterance>

      <utterance>I carried my little reports to Captain Galgenstein at the Garden house outside the town where he gave me rendezvous. These reports, of course, were arranged between me and the Chevalier beforehand. I was instructed, and it is always the best way, to tell as much truth as my story would possible bear.</utterance>
   <speaker>RODERICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He goes to church regularly -- he is very religious, and after hearing mass comes home to breakfast. Then he takes an airing in his chariot till dinner, which is served at noon. After dinner, he writes his letters, if he has any letters to write; but he has very little to do in this way. His letters are to the Austrian envoy, with whom he corresponds, but who does not acknowledge him; and being written in English, or course, I look over his shoulder. He generally writes for money. He makes his party with Calsabigi, the lottery contractor, the Russian attaches, two from the English embassy, my lords Deuceace and Punter, who play a jeu d'enfer, and a few more. He wins often, but not always. Lord Deuceace is a very fine player. The Chevalier Elliott, the English Minister, sometimes comes, on which occasion the secretaries do not play.</utterance>

      <context>Several cuts of playing and cheating to illustrate voice over.</context>
      <utterance>It was agreed that I should keep my character of valet, that in the presence of strangers I should not know a word of English, that I should keep good lookout on the trumps when I was serving the champagne and punch about; and, having a remarkably fine eyesight, and a great natural aptitude, I was speedily able to give my dear benefactor much assistance against his opponents at the green table.</utterance>
   <speaker>RODERICK</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>The Prince loses a big hand, and, in a fury, throws down his cards. He stares at the table, then at the Chevalier.</context>
      <utterance>Simplicity was our secret. Everything successful is simple. If, for instance, I wiped the dust off a chair with my napkin, it was to show that the enemy was strong in diamonds; if I pushed it, he had an ace, king; if I said, "Punch or wine, my lord?" hearts was meant. If "Wine or punch?" clubs. If I blew my nose, it was to indicate that there was another confederate employed by the adversary; and then, I warrant you, some pretty trials of skill would take place. The Prince of Turbingen, although so young, had a very great skill and cleverness with the cards in every way; and it was only from hearing Ritter von Brandenburg, who came with him, yawn three times when the Chevalier had the ace of trumps, that I knew we were Greek to Greek, as it were.</utterance>

      <context>Towards the end of the game, Dascher, seeing that he is losing, makes an unfair stroke, so obvious that the marker tells him so to his face. Lieutenant Dascher, for whom the stroke wins the game, takes the money which is in the stake bag, and puts it in his pocket, paying no attention to the marker's adjurations, or to Roderick's. Roderick, who is without his sword, reaches for a billiard cue and swings it at Dascher's face. He wards off the blow with his arm, drawing his sword and runs at Roderick, who is unarmed. The marker, a sturdy young man, catches Dascher around the waist and prevents murder.</context>

For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me? A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power. My wife never comes near me. What friend have I? None in the wide world.

It is these insults to you which shock and annoy me more than the ruffian's infamous conduct to myself. I would have stood by your ladyship, as I promised, but you seem to have taken latterly your husband's part; and, as I cannot personally chastise this low-bred ruffian, who, to our shame be it spoken, is the husband of my mother, and as I cannot bear to witness his treatment of you, and loathe his horrible society as if it were the plague, I am determined to quit my native country, at least during his detested life, or during my own.

      <mode></mode>
      <context>The King stares at Roderick, turns on his heel and quickly leaves the presence-chamber. Roderick is approached by the Duke of Rutland, who takes him aside into an alcove.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Roderick begins to sputter.</context>
      <utterance>Let me tell you, sir, that your conduct has been very odiously represented to the King, and has formed the subject of royal comment.

   <speaker>DUKE OF RUTLAND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hear me out, please. It has been intimated to His Majesty that you had raised the American Company for the sole purpose of getting the young Viscount to command it, and so get rid of him. And, further, that you had paid the very man in the company, who was ordered to dispatch him in the first general action.</utterance>

      <utterance>As for your ambitious hopes regarding the Irish peerages, His Majesty has also let it be known that you have been led astray by that Lord Crabs, who likes to take money, but who has no more influence to get a coronet than to procure a Pope's tiara.

      <utterance>Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point. The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know. Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet. As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please. And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.</utterance>

      <utterance>By now, my financial affairs were near to ruin. I could not get a guinea from any money-dealer in London. Our rents were in the hands of receivers by this time, and it was as much as I could do to get enough money from the rascals to pay my wine-merchants their bills. Our property was hampered, and often as I applied to my lawyers and agents for money, would come a reply demanding money of me for debts and pretended claims which the rapacious rascals said they had on me.</utterance>

We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes. One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.

      <utterance>Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you! Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side? Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you? Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you. I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty. What sacrifice do you want from me? I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.</utterance>

      <utterance>I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove. The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines. They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.</utterance>

      <utterance>Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.</utterance>

I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs.

      <utterance>I have been authorized by Lady Cosgrove and her advisors to pay you an annuity of 300 pounds a year, specifically on the condition of you remaining abroad out of the three kingdoms, and to be stopped on the instant of your return. I advise you to accept it without delay for you know, as well as I do, that your stay in London will infallibly plunge you in gaol, as there are innumerable writs taken out against you here and in the west of England, and that your credit is so blown upon that you could not hope to raise a shilling. I will leave you the night to consider this proposal, but if you refuse, the family will proceed against you in London, and have you arrested.
