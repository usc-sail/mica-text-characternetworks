   <speaker>MINISTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Chuck gazes out at the sleepy harbor, the minister's voice fading away. The afternoon wind is coming up with the tide. He quietly heads towards the water. Drifting, drawn, lost.</context>
      <utterance>I didn't know Richard Sheldrake personally, but his many friends who knew and worked with him, wanted to make sure that he was returned home, here, to be remembered with his beloved wife...</utterance>
   <speaker>OLDER CHUCK</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>A SHIP'S BELL turns him around. Ding ding. Ding ding. A beautiful three masted schooner steady on the water slips into port. A picture out of another time, another place. It takes him away...</context>
      <utterance>Though he had moved on with his life, now even for the years, to hear him eulogized by strangers, seemed strange. He had been a hewner of stones, a pilot by the silent stars. Like me, alone among many. But most of all for us, the crew of the brigantine Albatross, he was always and would forever be... our Skipper.</utterance>

      <context>This is BILL BUTLER, 15, removed, the youngest of the crew and... first mate. Bill gives Chuck a friendly slap on the back and climbs aboard. He is greeted by a Viking giant of a man, LAWFORD, 37, and bearded, the ship's English professor. Puffing on a huge Havana cigar, he stares coolly down at Tod and the others. He speaks with the voice of Moses.</context>

   <speaker>LAWFORD</speaker>

      <utterance>"That this same child of honor and renown, This gallant Hotspur, this all praised knight, And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet. For every honor sitting on his helm, Would they were multitudes, and on my head. My shames redoubled! For the time will come...</utterance>
   <speaker>LAWFORD</speaker>

      <context>Robin refuses to watch. The others share a look. John makes his way along the foot ropes and stands at the end of the yard. He tosses a look towards Bill but with no way to back down, he launches into the air. Everyone gasps as he thunders through the air in a broad swan dive. Falling, falling, falling...</context>

      <context>John hits the water like a bullet. The crew run to the side waiting for him to come up. Nothing. Finally, he breaks the surface. Easy. He climbs up waiting, somehow, to claim victory. Suddenly, they all feel it. A presence. He has appeared silently on top of the Chart House, like a phantom gazing down at them, back lit by the sun the boys must squint to see him. RICHARD SHELDRAKE, (SKIPPER), ageless and windswept, casually reaches up to a block and tackle with one arm and glides to the deck. He is powerfully built and bronzed from the sea and sun. He carriers the burden of command like a cross. Soft-spoken and remote, he is a man to be reckoned with. The crew know they are in the presence of someone larger than life.</context>
      <utterance>I can't watch this.</utterance>
   <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The crew line up clumsily. Skipper has a gaze that blazes right through them. He looks out to sea. Searching, ominous. He waits until the silence is filled with everyone's attention.</context>
      <utterance>Skipper on deck!</utterance>
   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He spits into the water. The crew sheepishly throw glances to the horizon.</context>
      <utterance>You know what's out there? Wind and wave and rain. Endless glassy pools that'll hold a sailing ship for weeks and then spit her out into the eye of the kind of hurricane. A blow that could knock the bridge off a battleship. Reefs and rocks and sandbars that'll tear the belly from her and enough fog and night to hide it all.</utterance>
   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Skipper turns his gaze back to the boys. There is a fire in his eyes. Nobody dare answers.</context>
      <utterance>So look out there... and explain to me why any man in possession of any sense at all, would take on the sea with sail?</utterance>
   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His ear to the wind.</context>
      <utterance>Because there's something else out there. It beckons in the wind and sings in the shrouds. Voices. Whispering...</utterance>
   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He turns back to the sea, dark.</context>
      <utterance>They're voices of men. Calling. Men you don't even know. Men you can't even imagine. It's a seed, a wish, that part of you and I that aches to be alive, that was banished by everything we've ever been taught or told. It's a part of us that can only be found on mountain tops and deserts, in the deepest caverns, smoking battle fields and... across oceans.</utterance>

      <context>Skipper manages a sobering look and climbs on top of the chart house. He pats a small brass sign that is welded to the main mast and reads the inscription.</context>
      <utterance>He was everything I had expected, part Ahab part Queeg and even Bligh. He spoke in whispers and answered all queries with efficiency and directness. He had gone to sea for the first time at fifteen, the same age as Bill Butler. And as he looked upon us that first day it must have been as though he were staring into a mirror.</utterance>

      <utterance>Second, the next one of you who doesn't jump like a bunny when Mr. Butler gives an order is gonna spend the rest of this trip scrubbing bilges. He's a better sailor today than any ten of you will be when this is all over.</utterance>

      <utterance>Excellent point. As you might have noticed, being out here pretty much puts you in the moment. If you panic, if you lose your head, you die. Maybe you take your mates with you. How'd you like to have to bet on Terry here getting us home today? Each one of you is responsible for the rest. "Where we go one, we go all".

Oh, and one more thing. There is nothing that goes on, on this boat that I don't know about. She speaks to me in the night. So don't test me. Not even a little.</utterance>

      <utterance>You know what a loose cannon is? 'Bout the worst thing that could happen to a wooden ship. All it took was one, crashing around the deck in a storm...

      <utterance>Now, if the Skipper were smart, if he could see a storm building, why he'd cut loose every gun on his boat. Even though it would leave him at a disadvantage in battle, he'd push 'em into the sea. Better chance running for port than risk the entire ship, his crew.</utterance>
   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He walks back to his place at the rail.</context>
      <utterance>People are like that sometimes. They cut loose and before you know it, they're knocking holes in everything. So you gotta ask yourself if it might not be better to just put 'em off before they sink the whole thing. I mean after all, you can always get new cannons.</utterance>

      <context>Everyone rushes to see. Dolphins leaping out of the water. It's a magnificent game they play with ships. The crew cheers as each one explodes out of the sea, close enough to touch. Isolated, Phil watches. Angry, cut off. Chuck eyes him, worried. Bill and Charlie rig the bowswain's chair and lower Rick into the water. Suddenly, the dolphins are everywhere. Rick pets them as they swim back and forth. Shear joy. Phil reaches for the spear gun. Nobody notices as he loads and takes aim. Suddenly... with a crack, everyone spins around. A large female dolphin leaps out of the water, bloody foam spraying from her blow hole. She lets out an agonizing scream. Phil holds her fast.</context>
      <utterance>There they blow!! There they blow!! Dolphins off the bow!!!</utterance>
   <speaker>CHRIS</speaker>

   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Phil looks up at the crew but one by one they look away. Chuck finds this confusing and inexcusable but is the last to look away. Skipper grimly walks over to one of the deck lockers and pulls out a large wooden mallet and holds it out to Phil.</context>
      <utterance>Nice shot.</utterance>
   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Phil looks at the mallet, horrified.</context>

   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Phil backs away. Skipper stares at him for a moment, then walks over to the dolphin. Robin looks away. The sickening sound of the mallet crushing the skull of the animal seems to silence the world. There are one of two thumps of her tail and, it's over. Skipper tosses the bloody mallet into the locker and approaches Phil, his face flushed with anger. He grabs the spear gun, and snaps it across his knee and throws the pieces into the sea.</context>
      <utterance>You already have. Now go on. Do it.</utterance>
   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Phil begins to shake with rage.</context>
      <utterance>What the hell is wrong with you?!</utterance>
   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Robin holds his ears as if he can make it all go away. For a brief moment Phil looks as if he might take Skipper up on the challenge. Then the impulse passes.</context>
      <utterance>Come on. You got so much fight in you; you wanna kill something? Take your best shot. The first one's free.</utterance>
   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Skipper turns. The humiliation is more than Phil can take. He lunges after Skipper. Lawford grabs him. Phil swings wildly.</context>
      <utterance>That's what I thought.  You're done. You're going home.</utterance>
   <speaker>PHIL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lawford leads Phil, struggling, below. The crew surround the dead dolphin, stunned.</context>

   <speaker>TYLER</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>What does this have to do with anything Mr. Sanders?</utterance>
   <speaker>SANDERS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, nothing. I was just curious.</utterance>
   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sanders returns to his seat, rattled. Tyler pounds his gavel.</context>
      <utterance>My father, was more seaman, more of a man, than you might ever hope to be.</utterance>
   <speaker>TYLER</speaker>

      <utterance>There's still a way.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>What do you mean?</utterance>
   <speaker>TOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's me, don't you see. Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch. I disobeyed order.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.</utterance>
   <speaker>TOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right? I'm a kid.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But that's not the point...</utterance>
   <speaker>TOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.</utterance>
   <speaker>LATER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tod is on the stand.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOWNING</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?</utterance>
   <speaker>TOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Tyler removes his glasses.</context>
      <utterance>I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOWNING</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.</utterance>
   <speaker>TOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Twice.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOWNING</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is that what you were trained to do?</utterance>
   <speaker>TOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOWNING</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then what do you think he was trying to do.</utterance>
   <speaker>TOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Skipper is becoming uneasy. He sees what is coming.</context>
      <utterance>Let the blow drive the boat down wind. Neutralize our canvas.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOWNING</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?</utterance>
   <speaker>TOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No.</utterance>
   <speaker>TYLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Tod meets Skipper's eyes.</context>
      <utterance>Then why son, why didn't you follow his order?</utterance>
   <speaker>TOD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The room is suddenly buzzing. Tod's Father stands up.</context>
      <utterance>Because -- I panicked.</utterance>
   <speaker>TOD'S FATHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's not true Tod.</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What the hell? What is he doing.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Tyler turns to Skipper.</context>
      <utterance>Son of a gun. He just sent Skipper a life boat.</utterance>
   <speaker>TYLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?</utterance>
   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.</utterance>
   <speaker>TYLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Skipper stands.</context>
      <utterance>Then what are you trying to say then?</utterance>
   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Skipper pulls out his wallet and takes out his license.</context>
      <utterance>Maybe you can't see what's happening here, but it's clear to me.  I appreciate what you're trying to do Tod. Maybe you could live with it, but I couldn't.  If you think I'm going to let a sixteen year old take responsibility, then you underestimate me. The Albatross was my ship. The Ocean Academy was my school. Her loss is mine and mine alone.  I can't bring your sons back. If you want my ticket, if that will ease your loss, it's the least I can do. This...</utterance>
   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Skipper turns and lays his license down in front of Tyler. Then he turns and begins walking towards the back of the room. The room erupts. Crew members and their families hurl accusations and blame. Cameras flash. Tyler tries to regain control. Suddenly Chuck stands, tall.</context>
      <utterance>This is easy. Living with it, that'll be hard.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Skipper keeps walking. His head slumps. Tyler pounds his gavel.</context>
      <utterance>No!!! Don't you walk away! Not now. Not after all of this!!!!</utterance>
   <speaker>TYLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Tears begin to stream down Chuck's face. His father, Charles, slowly stands meeting his sons eyes. Go for it.</context>
      <utterance>That enough son!! Order!! Please!!</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Skipper keeps moving.</context>
      <utterance>Tell me Skipper, was it all just a lie? "Where we go one, we go all". We listened to you. We believed it. And we're still here!!</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Skipper reaches for the door. Suddenly a sound stops him cold in his tracks. Phil slowly rises. Tears streaming down his face. Tightly in his hands he grips the ships bell. Ding ding. Ding ding. Ding ding. It is the ringing of the truth. The tolling of their unity.</context>
      <utterance>Shame on you then Skipper. Shame on you.</utterance>
   <speaker>FRANCIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Phil ignores him. Skipper slowly walks over, his eyes never leaving Phil's. He stops, facing him. He gently takes his hands and silences the bell. Then he smiles and puts a hand on the back of Phil's head fighting his own emotions. He turns to Chuck.</context>
      <utterance>Sit down!</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The room grows silent.</context>
      <utterance>Tell them the truth. Make them understand.</utterance>
   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Chuck suddenly feels the eyes of the room.</context>
      <utterance>You tell them Chuck.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He turns to the tribunal.</context>
      <utterance>It's simple. Bad things happen sometimes. It wasn't Skipper or Tod. It was all of us. Everyone in this room. Because we all knew the risks.  You sent us... You paid our tuition, you allowed us to go. So to invent a reason for why this happened, to pin it on one person, well that won't change anything. It'll just make our experience meaningless.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Chuck turns to Skipper.</context>
      <utterance>If you want to judge this man, judge him by his crew. Judge him by Alice and George. Chris and John and Robin. In one way or another each one of them gave their lives saving one of us. This may sound crazy but the Albatross wasn't just a ship, or even a school. It was something that we made, that's inside us. That's who Skipper is. That's what he taught us. I guess what it really was about was... the privilege of sacrifice.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Skipper nods.</context>
      <utterance>Isn't that right?</utterance>
   <speaker>SKIPPER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The room is silent. Then, a voice. A golden tenor singing like the wind. Everyone turns. It's Bill.</context>
      <utterance>That's right.</utterance>
   <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>One by one the crew members stand and begin to sing. Chuck turns, surprised to see his father rise and stand with him. Words or not.</context>
      <utterance>When the sun came up, there was whisky in the cup, and not a one of us was sober...</utterance>
   <speaker>CREW TOGETHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They all stand facing Skipper and sing. The voices build, sweeping over everyone like a wave.</context>
      <utterance>Jenny thought she saw a picture when it really was the sun, then we knew the party was over.</utterance>
   <speaker>CREW TOGETHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Skipper meets Chuck's eyes and those of his mates. Only now is his job finished. He beams back. The music swells like an anthem, building, like a swell lifting a small wooden boat over a jagged reef, until it rests safely in the calm waters beyond. The crew come together around Skipper one last time. They embrace.</context>
      <utterance>Oh my heart is sad, for leaving you today, but I know we'll meet again, when the moon is in the valley and the leafs are on the trees, We will come to clearly in the glen...</utterance>

   <speaker>HARBOR MASTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He walks over to the dock.</context>
      <utterance>What do you think you're doing.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARBOR MASTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He tries to board the boat but Chuck greets him with the sharp end of a gaffing hook.</context>
      <utterance>All right friend, out of the boat.</utterance>
   <speaker>OLDER CHUCK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He looks into Chuck's eyes and sees that he means business. He backs off. Chucks pushes away and raises the sail. The harbor master watches, perplexed as the small boat moves off for open water.</context>
      <utterance>Stand away.</utterance>

<dialogue id="97" n_utterances="2">
   <speaker>OLDER CHUCK</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Chuck turns to the sea and speaks.</context>
      <utterance>They didn't take his ticket that day. But why he never returned to the sea, I'd never know. Perhaps he hadn't been able to free himself from the anchor of grief that had driven him to his knees aboard the Gran Rio, or that he no longer cared for the solitude and isolation of command without his Alice. Or maybe it was just that the waves that had spoken to him for so long, had grown silent. Whatever it was, that thing, it had always troubled me. Because, fate offers up no reasons. And maybe that's what I have traveled these thirty four years to say. Maybe that is all I really know... And, that one man cared.</utterance>
   <speaker>OLDER CHUCK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>With a powerful heave, he hurls the Skipper's remains at the sinking sun and into the arms of Neptune.</context>
      <utterance>Rest easy old salt. For together again, we'll sail.</utterance>
