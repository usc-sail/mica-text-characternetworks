It was my stepfather, Joe Capote, calling to say that my mother had died. I flew home to New York -- terribly distraught -- but when I got to the apartment I could see that Joe was in even worse shape than I was. He grabbed my hands and sat me down at the kitchen table, and he said to me, "Talk. Talk about anything, any subject in the world. Don't worry whether it will interest me or not. Just talk so I won't break down." And I did. He couldn't bear to be alone with his thoughts. It was too painful.</utterance>

STATE TROOPERS spill out of the lead and rear CARS. Nye gets out of the second car. He opens the back door. The crowd falls SILENT. Two state troopers get DICK HICKOCK -- handcuffed, pale -- out of the car and lead him up the steps. FLASH. FLASH. Dewey and Church open the third car's back door. Silence. They retrieve PERRY SMITH. Perry is extremely SHORT, STRONG, ODDLY BEAUTIFUL, with the dark skin and hair of his American Indian mother, and the pug features of his Irish father. As he stands, he has trouble straightening his stubby LEGS, as if they are arthritic. Truman stares.</context>

      <utterance>On the night of November 14, two men broke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas and murdered an entire family. Why did they do that? It's been suggested that this subject is tawdry -- it's not worthy of literature. I disagree. Two worlds exist in this country -- the quiet conservative life, and the life of those two men -- the underbelly, the criminally violent. Those worlds converged that bloody night. I spent the past three months interviewing everyone in Kansas touched by that violence. I spent hours talking to the killers -- and I'll spend more.  Researching this work has changed my life, altered my point of view about almost everything. I think those who read it will be similarly affected.  Such a book can only be written by a journalist who has mastered the techniques of fiction --</utterance>
