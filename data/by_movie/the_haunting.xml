      <utterance>It'll take a month to probate the will, Nell! A month! Even if Mother left you something, you won't get it in time to pay the rent. So instead of complaining, you should be thanking Lou for getting you these two weeks to get Mother's things packed.</utterance>

      <context>Richie knocks a porcelain DOLL off, and it breaks all over the carpet. His parents don't notice. But Nell feels it in the soul. Richie stops. A long beat. He looks at her, insolent, then plows on with his tank.</context>
      <utterance>I'm not going to stay. I'll get a job. I'll get my own apartment.</utterance>
   <speaker>JANE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nell. A job? Two months and where is this job? You have no degree, you've never worked -- Nell explodes in outraged fury, startling us.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You have no experience in the world... the regular world. What would you put on a resume?  Now we all appreciate what you did for Mother. Isn't that right, Lou?</utterance>

      <utterance>Eleven years. Long time.</utterance>
   <speaker>JANE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She goes to Lou, puts a hand on his shoulder, proud of her generosity. All Nell can do is stare. And then: KNOCK KNOCK. Like a shot Nell is out of the chair and turning for a set of FRENCH DOORS across the room. It's all reflex. Nell catches herself. KNOCK KNOCK. Richie, lying on the couch like he's sick, raps on the wall with a wooden CANE and squeals:</context>
      <utterance>That's why we've been talking. With me getting more time in Accessories, and Lou at the shop all day, we need somebody to take care of Richie, do a little cleaning and cooking. And in return you can have the extra room.</utterance>
   <speaker>RICHIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nell REACTS, but rather than being amused or annoyed, a wave of TRAUMA flickers over her face. The reaction is so strong we instantly know something is very wrong.</context>

   <speaker>JANE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nell knows what is going to happen to that jewelry. Jane no longer can bear the weight of Nell's stare, checks her watch. She nods at Lou. Lou rises, pocketing the coin set. Richie follows him out. JANE (cont'd) Think about our offer, Nell. You don't know how hard it is out there.</context>
      <utterance>You're sure this is all of Mother's jewelry? The lawyer said to make sure we took it to him...  He said there might be some antique pieces. Have you seen anything? Some of it might be valuable.</utterance>

   <speaker>MARROW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Malcolm looks at the monitor. This is Marrow's chance to explain it again. MARROW (cont'd) Look, look at what it does! The subjects on the left, because they anticipate the shocks, make the adjustment, and lose nothing on their scores. The subjects on the right, because the shocks are random, can't anticipate, and the distraction throws them off.</context>
      <utterance>Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer! And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>At this moment,</context>
      <utterance>Stop defending your science after the fact, Jim. The department protocol for research is very clear about this, and you violated the rules. I know, I know, I know that "Fear and Performance" is a big sexy idea, but as long as I'm chairman here you will need this department's endorsement to publish it, and right now I can't do that.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing. Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And that will be a good place to end this study.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARROW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, Malcolm! Individual performance is only part of it. I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARROW</speaker>

      <context></context>

      <context>A PHOTO OF NELL falls on the floor. Marrow scoops it up. He holds the photo of Nell up to Mary, and look at the written notes and studies the graphs that go with it. MARROW (cont'd) This is correct?</context>

We find clinical-looking shots from Stanley Milgram's experiments: subjects appearing to scream in response to electrical shock. Rows of weeping prisoners in the Stanford prison experiment. Photos of victims crushed under the stands of a soccer stadium, the aftermath of a riot. A picture of the Fuhrer before his mesmerized masses. Mary opens a large envelope.

He could have anything he wanted. And what he wanted, was Rene, his banker's beautiful daughter. Rene, and a house filled with children.</context>

      <context>Marrow and Theo rush over to her as she shrieks in pain. Todd is frozen, pale, like he's about to be sick.

Her shrieking becomes a terrified but quieter wail.</context>

She pockets them, thoughtful, but just as she does -- -- something MOVES in the fireplace. So fleeting Nell can barely see it, and we only catch a frame of it. But the iron MESH CURTAIN hanging in front of the hearth is STILL SWAYING. Nell stands there FROZEN. The massive fireplace LOOMS before her, like a monstrous mouth, black as pitch beyond the black metal curtains. The swaying metal scrapes over brick floor. Its eerie, repetitive screep cutting to the nerve. Nell sits paralyzed, rooted to the chair. SCREEP. SCREEP. SCREEP. A SINGLE STRAND of NELL'S HAIR stirs toward the fireplace, and --</context>

Luke throws back the other screen. Theo comes over. Nell follows. There's nothing else in the fireplace. Luke and Theo stare at Nell. Marrow squats to study the hearth. The large iron ASH-DROP is coated in soot. Not a mark on it. He opens it. Inside, a glimpse of ASHES and CHARRED WOOD. Marrow stands, looks at Nell. NELL (cont'd) Somebody was in here. I saw him. Marrow looks at her, not sure what to believe. Nell turns to Luke and Theo for help. Not from that corner. Then Nell remembers, reaches into her pocket and produces the KEYS.

   <speaker>NELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>For the first time since we've seen Nell, there is something to her which is simply... erotic. Marrow follows her down one of the footpaths. She smiles back at Marrow as he trails her. She reaches a transept in the greenhouse, and as she turns down it, there's the slightest sway to her gait. Marrow follows her around the corner into the transept. At the far end the wall is completely overgrown. Nell looks up through the ceiling at Hill House looming grim outside, distorted in the old glass.</context>
      <utterance>I was just thinking how happy I am right now. All my life, I've been waiting for an adventure. And I thought, oh, I'll never have that, adventures are for people who travel long distances, that's for soldiers, that's for the women that the bullfighters fall in love with.

      <context>Nell glances at him, and for that split second she is raw, passionate woman. She walks away, the sway in her gait aching, powerful. Marrow is surprised by what Nell just said and stares at her as she comes to the overgrown end. Nell reaches out to the hanging vines, pulls them aside... ...and A FACE stares out. Gastly. White. Nell takes an involuntary step back, a little gasp. The face is marble. Blind eyes stare from stained cheeks. It is a STATUE OF CRAIN. Marrow comes over. It's an enormous stone tableaux of Hugh surrounded by cherubim. The plants have attacked it as if trying to wipe its funerary presence from the greenhouse. NELL (cont'd) Hugh Crain. Can't seem to get away from him. She laughs a little at herself. Marrow joins in. He helps her pull the plants back to reveal more of it. She reaches out, touches the marble cheek. Then daring, grins, and begins to hum her TUNE. Marrow steps back to watch her do a sensual slow-dance with Hugh Crain, pirouetting, her hips sliding past... hypnotizing Marrow.</context>
      <utterance>It doesn't matter. Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me. What I do with this is up to me. I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer. And I want to be the volunteer.</utterance>

Outside the window, through the glass, she sees Mr. Dudley, staring at her, he's been watching her dance. The spell is broken. Nell, embarrassed, can't bear to look at him. A beat, and then Marrow goes over and shuts the door. When he turns back -- -- Nell is just vanishing around the corner, her rapid footsteps echoing in the vaulted room.</context>
      <utterance>I don't know. A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?</utterance>

Marrow's BRIEFCASE. Nell goes to the briefcase, knowing she shouldn't look, and unable to help herself. Marrow's digital recorder glints out at her. Nell takes it out, and presses play.

      <utterance>...the hallway discussion about last night's fireplace incident concluded at three a.m. Nell continues her alienation of the other subjects and the experimenter. It remains unclear whether she truly believes she did not deface the painting.

Marrow looks from her to the briefcase and back. MARROW (cont'd) Were you looking for me? Nell can't answer. Marrow comes over, unsettled. MARROW (cont'd) How are the tests going? Nell rises, staring, emotionless. Betrayal just beginning to find a hold. She hands him her papers. Marrow looks at Nell, knows she's been in his briefcase. He picks it up, and with a final, sorry glance, exits.</context>

      <utterance>I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance. Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell. A communal story. Someone starts it. Then we all add a little more to it.

I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it. That's what this experiment has all been about. That's what it was about, the experiment's over.

The sway gets wilder as he goes. At twenty feet, with twenty more to go to reach Nell, he stops. The stairs buck, sway out dizzily. And then to his dismay, he realizes he's on the WRONG SIDE of the double helix staircase. MARROW (cont'd) Damn it. He straddles the rail to climb over to the other half.</context>

      <context>The sudden shift is too much for the old stairs. The support rods CREASE and then the whole enormous column of steel from where Marrow is standing to the ground BURSTS from its supports. Luke shoves Theo aside, and the bottom half of the stairs spirals out in a massive, deafening COLLAPSE. Marrow's cellular phone falls out of his pocket and shatters in hundred pieces across the floor. The top half of the stairs remains, still hanging from the ceiling. Nell grips the railing at the top. Marrow hangs there by one hand over the razor tangle of steel below. He flails out for the other stairway, swings himself over to it. It takes a moment for him to realize he almost just died.

Nell stands a mere arm's length from him on the other side of the railing. MARROW (cont'd) Come on, Nell. You have to climb over and step back on the stairs. Nell barely seems to hear him. Instead she looks at the DEFORMING SUPPORT RODS around her. We HEAR the voices of the CHILDREN, calling to her. MARROW (cont'd) Nell! Now! Theo, on the ground, calls up to Nell.</context>

      <context>They reach the transept, turn down it toward the statue of Crain at the end looming white in the dusk. Dead silence. Then Marrow SCREAMS. Under a thin layer of ice underneath the giant hand that protrudes from the pond we find Watt's body, as if the hand wants to keep him there forever. Marrow did find his Watts, a horrifying sight.</context>

      <context>As at the same time out of the mouth from the sculpture erupts a river of blood, scaring the hell out of them. Their clothes splattered with blood, Marrow quickly leads them out of there.</context>

      <context>Marrow and Theo look at him. It's what they've been thinking, but haven't had the courage to say. Theo stops suddenly. Turns around. The men notice, and pause. Then they hear it. Faint. Floating down from upstairs somewhere. Nell's TUNE. It doesn't sound right, but it's hard to tell as it's coming from so far away. They look at each other, start for the stairs.</context>

      <context>It takes Marrow and Luke a moment to come after her. The CREAKING gets louder, unnerving. They get to the doors, Theo first. She pushes them wide.</context>

   <speaker>THEO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Let's go, hon. Don't you want to go back to your little apartment where you can hear the buoy out in the harbor when the wind is just right? Nell smiles at Theo. She's holding something.</utterance>
   <speaker>NELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, Theo. You know I don't have an apartment.</utterance>
   <speaker>THEO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nell's smile softens even more. Her voice is reassuring.</context>
      <utterance>Then let's go get you one.</utterance>
   <speaker>NELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A CHILL of fear cuts through Theo as Nell looks deep into her eyes. NELL (cont'd) After all... (beat) I'm family. The thing in Nell's hand is a NEEDLE, the thing she's been cranking an ANCIENT PHONOGRAPH. She lowers the needle to the spinning record. And HER TUNE, the one she hums all the time, begins to play. The others are frozen where they stand. Marrow's mind reels at the implications of what he's hearing.</context>
      <utterance>Don't worry about me, Theo. I'm wanted. Right here. I'm home.</utterance>

      <utterance>No.</utterance>
   <speaker>NELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And that, finally, galvanizes the others into action. Marrow sweeps past Theo, grabs Nell hard, and swings her for the door.</context>
      <utterance>My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her. Nell turns back. The others stand there speechless. NELL  I have to stay. You better go. I could explain it, but you'd never understand.</utterance>

   <speaker>NELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Theo stares, appalled. Marrow looks around, puts his hand up to shush everyone. The HOUSE MOANS, the BUMPING growing, searching.</context>
      <utterance>It's not safe for you anymore. The children need me, and Crain is doing everything he can to keep me from them.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARROW</speaker>

   <speaker>LUKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The men rush the same window, side-by-side, and let the heavy pieces of furniture fly from ten feet. The WINDOW SHATTERS, dozens of panes blown out into the darkness beyond. But the metal LATTICE remains, the chair's legs stuck in it. Marrow and Luke pause, taken back a beat. They hustle over to it. Theo and Nell stand a few feet back. Luke grabs the chair, levers it, tries to pry open the metal. Marrow reaches through, knocking loose glass, trying to find some sort of handle on the other side.</context>
      <utterance>Watch out!</utterance>
   <speaker>THEO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Theo watches the door behind them. Luke pries at the inch of metal between him and freedom. It won't break.</context>
      <utterance>Hurry!</utterance>
   <speaker>MARROW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Marrow slips on the broken glass and catches hold of the lattice LACERATING his ring and little finger. With a cry of pain, he lands on the floor. MARROW (cont'd) Oh Jesus my hand. Nell and Theo fall to the floor to help him. Marrow moans, and Nell grips his injured hand in hers. Fast, like she was born a trauma doctor, Nell clamps off the blood with her fingers.</context>
      <utterance>They don't open!</utterance>
   <speaker>NELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Marrow tugs at his shoe, in shock, and looks at Nell. She's calm. Terrifyingly calm. And in that moment, he realizes she's not out of her mind. She just understands things beyond what he could possible begin to understand.</context>
      <utterance>Give me your shoelace.</utterance>

      <context>Nell cinches the shoelace tight around his wrist. Luke throws down the chair, giving up on the window.</context>
      <utterance>Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us. Don't get in the way, please.</utterance>
   <speaker>LUKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As he looks up at another one of Crain's painting hanging on the wall. Nell Theo with Marrow straggle toward the great hall.</context>

   <speaker>MARROW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Before anyone can stop him, he LIGHTS a towering TAPESTRY on fire. He races from one to the next, lighting them. Theo and Nell help Marrow up, back away as Luke shoots by. All the tapestries are ON FIRE, blazing up like torches. At last, his rage spent, heaving, he moves to join the others at the center of the room. They stare at him, appalled, afraid. Knowing he has done something wrong. Luke stops. Maybe fifteen feet away. He sees their expressions.</context>
      <utterance>Luke!</utterance>
   <speaker>LUKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nell looks over at the burning tapestries. Heat sears the stone, blackens the carved figures in the woodwork. The ruddy light casts deep shadows throughout the room. LUKE (cont'd) We'll get out after this wing burns down. Let's go. But there's no need. The tapestries are consuming themselves too fast to ignite the walls or ceiling. They all realize it. As the last flaming scraps of cloth fall to the floor and go out, there is utter silence.</context>

<dialogue id="60" n_utterances="2">
   <speaker>NELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She knows what is going to happen, is powerless to prevent it. Luke stands up, has time to give her a look. And then the LION'S HEAD FLUE drops open behind him. Luke looks back into its iron eyes -- -- and with SHOCKING SPEED the FLUE snaps shut again, taking Luke's head off his body. The decapitated corpse falls back in the fireplace like a puppet with its strings cut. Nell, Marrow and Theo stand there. Not sure of what just happened, their minds unable to accept it. A sound comes up in Theo's throat. A sob. A horrified whimper. Marrow and Nell stand there speechless. It's as if saying the obvious will make it real:</context>
      <utterance>No! No! Let them go!</utterance>
   <speaker>MARROW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>BANG. The blood-splattered LION'S HEAD drops open. Luke's head falls out. Theo SCREAMS and SCREAMS again. Nell backs away with Marrow, almost has the presence of mind to drag them away, but -- -- CLANG! The ASH DROP OPENS. The sudden sound stops them in their tracks. As they watch, it's as if the House INHALES. And BOOM! Out of the ash drop EXPLODES a hail of BONES, SKULLS, FLYING ASH. Nell, Theo and Marrow back up toward the Grand Staircase as TONS OF INCINERATED HUMAN REMAINS vomit from the fireplace, blasting across the floor, knocking over furniture with shocking violence. Skulls bounce over wood. Hundreds of them. Theo and Marrow cover their faces as shattered bits of bone, loose teeth pelt them. Nell is immune. They run up the Grand Staircase toward the top and finally it can't reach them anymore.</context>

      <context>Behind them the huge painting of Hugh Crain in a golden frame with sharp metal spikes, looks down at them. The room inhales and exhales, the bumping sound resumes. A rumble runs through the house and they all look down in fear toward the great hall where a cloud of ashes still hangs in the air. Unseen by them, this rumble start to shake the painting behind them. The sound from the great hall makes Marrow and Theo back up more, but Nell doesn't move... she senses something is about to happen and she will fight it... She suddenly turns and sees the painting... in a flash she reaches out for Marrow and Theo, pull them out of the way as the giant painting with the huge skull, falls face down toward them. It misses them by a hair, but their clothes are shredded by the spikes. Marrow and Theo are-shocked as they back up right toward the GRIFFIN on top of the staircase. For a split second the BRASS Griffin right behind them, comes alive, opens it's fangs and claws and is ready to attack... but Nell sees the danger, grabs a human bone and batters the griffin. NELL (cont'd) No, no, you leave them alone! And the griffin turns back into brass. Marrow and Theo unaware of what happened behind them. They have to get out of there.</context>

The Shape rushes from the Great Hall, vanishing as it crosses the pools of moonlight, reforming darker as it hits shadow again, its wake like a shockwave, invisible itself, but VISIBLE IN ITS EFFECTS: Theo SCREAMS. Marrow stumbles back. And then Nell's voice rings out: NELL (cont'd) Is this where she bashed your brains in? The onrushing presence STOPS. Seems to turn its attention to Nell, standing there before the towering front doors. NELL (cont'd) When you came in the door? I bet that was the last thing you expected. Right? From</context>
