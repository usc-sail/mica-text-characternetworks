      <mode>TO MARTHA</mode>
      <context>Watts takes the half grilled cheese sandwich and stuffs it into his mouth. The waitress clears the plate. Watts takes Martha's napkin and wipes the grease from his hands and mouth while he chews.</context>
      <utterance>You not gonna eat that?</utterance>

      <context>The waitress drops the check on the table. Watts stares at Martha for another moment before reaching into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers. He sorts through them and separates a $20 bill. He stuffs the rest of the papers back into his pocket. He grabs her hand, places the money in her palm and grips it closed.</context>
      <utterance>No?</utterance>
   <speaker>WATTS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He lets go. Her hand goes limp and the money falls on the table. She does not look at him. He leans in and forces eye contact with her. Watts, growing increasingly tense, stands up and glances around the diner. It is very busy. He does not want to make a scene in front of all these people. He leans down and kisses Martha on the cheek. She doesn't kiss back. He holds his forehead to her forehead until she reacts. She reluctantly kisses him on the lips. Martha watches him walk outside. As soon as his back is turned, she gets up, runs through the diner, and suddenly cuts through the kitchen.</context>
      <utterance>I'll get this.</utterance>

And fear is the greatest human emotion of all because it creates complete awareness. When you're scared it forces you to be completely aware of your surroundings and the moment you're in. It brings you to NOW and that makes you truly present. And when you are truly present, that's nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is pure love.</utterance>
