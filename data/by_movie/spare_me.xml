      <utterance>Bowling!  Bowling is a little like faith. Every now and then, we are blessed with the ability and strength to send a full roller down..  ...and scatter those babies like nobody's business. And every now and then we end up in the gutter.  Buzz Fazeli found himself in the gutter of life. Trapped in hook alley, throwing nothing balls. But before he left us for that pie alley in the clouds, he pulled himself out of that gutter. Buzz Fazeli died cleaning up the sport of bowling. Now he lies at peace alongside his lane brothers here in Bowlers' Field.  He died so that we could bowl - with dignity.

      <utterance>We ain't married no more.</utterance>
   <speaker>THEO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As she tries to wiggle away from him, the club conks Buzz on the noodle, squishing his halo.</context>
      <utterance>He says that to all his wives.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Geez Maynard, is he telling the truth?</utterance>
   <speaker>BUZZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't pay him any mind, sweetheart.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're a nice guy, Maynard, but if you got two wives - I ain't into no polybigamy. Buzz is silent. He takes the club out of her hand. She steps away - startled - then turns and jogs away. Buzz throws down his club in a fury.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUZZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Goddam it! I was just about to make a love connection. You sure got a way with women. You show up, women get away.</utterance>
   <speaker>THEO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The whole world thinks you're underground.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUZZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Buzz removes his damaged cap.</context>
      <utterance>I am underground.</utterance>
   <speaker>THEO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It could just as easily have been me in that box.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUZZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.</utterance>
   <speaker>THEO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What about bowling?</utterance>
   <speaker>BUZZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.</utterance>
   <speaker>THEO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Buzz pats his hair down and slips the cap back on his head.</context>
      <utterance>You're a scumbag.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUZZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Theo digs into his pocket and retrieves the golf ball. He tosses it to Buzz.</context>
      <utterance>I'm a live scumbag.</utterance>
   <speaker>THEO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Theo turns and walks towards his car. Buzz pauses and walks after him.</context>
      <utterance>Nice knowing you, dad.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUZZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So, eh, you never saw me. Right?</utterance>
   <speaker>THEO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I never saw you.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUZZ</speaker>

      <utterance>Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?</utterance>
   <speaker>THEO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUZZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUZZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUZZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.</utterance>
   <speaker>THEO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Buzz backs away from the car as Theo peels out in reverse. Buzz stands and watches as Theo pulls away.</context>
      <utterance>See ya 'round Maynard.</utterance>
