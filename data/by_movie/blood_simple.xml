   <speaker>VISSER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He removes a pouch of tobacco from his breast pocket and nonchalantly starts rolling a cigarette.</context>
      <utterance>What do you mean...</utterance>
   <speaker>VISSER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.</utterance>

      <utterance>How long did you watch her?</utterance>
   <speaker>VISSER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He lights his cigarette, then slaps his lighter onto the desktop. It is silver, engraved on the top with a lariat spelling out "Loren" in script, and on the side with a declaration that he is "Elks Man of the Year."</context>
      <utterance>Most of the night...</utterance>
   <speaker>VISSER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Marty stares down at the photograph.</context>
      <utterance>...They'd just rest a few minutes and then get started again. Quite something.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARTY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A smoke ring floats into frame from offscreen.</context>
      <utterance>You know in Greece they cut off the head of the messenger who brought bad news.</utterance>
   <speaker>VISSER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now that don't make much sense.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARTY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Marty rises and goes to a safe behind his desk. Visser laughs as he watches Marty.</context>
      <utterance>No. It just made them feel better.</utterance>
   <speaker>VISSER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Marty, hunched over the standing safe behind his desk, tosses in the photograph and takes out a pay envelope.</context>
      <utterance>Well first off, Julian, I don't know what the story is in Greece but in this state we got very definite laws about that...</utterance>
   <speaker>VISSER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Visser blows another smoke ring, pushes a fat finger through the middle of it, and beams at Marty.</context>
      <utterance>...Second place I ain't a messenger, I'm a private investigator. And third place--and most important--it ain't such bad news. I mean you thought he was a colored.  ...You're always assumin' the worst...</utterance>
   <speaker>VISSER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...Anything else?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARTY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Marty scales the pay envelope across the desk. It hits Visser in the chest and bounces to the floor. Visser looks stonily down at the envelope; no expression for a beat. Then he roars with laughter.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.</utterance>
   <speaker>VISSER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sighing, he leans forward to pick up the envelope. He rises, straightens his cowboy hat, and walks over to a screen door letting out on the bar's back parking lot.</context>
      <utterance>That's good... "which rock to turn over"... that's very good...</utterance>
   <speaker>VISSER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He pauses at the door, cocks his head, then turns back to the desk and picks up his cigarette lighter. Returning to the door:</context>
      <utterance>Well, gimme a call whenever you wanna cut off my head...</utterance>
   <speaker>VISSER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Marty scowls at the back door. After a moment he rises and crosses the office to the window looking out on the bar. Over Marty's shoulder we see the long bar leading up to the window in perpendicular. The camera is tracking forward, past Marty, to frame on the window. A black man is just now vaulting the near end of the bar, over onto the customer side.</context>
      <utterance>...I can crawl around without it. The door slams shut behind him.</utterance>

   <speaker>MEURICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A Motown song drops. We track behind Meurice as he makes his way back toward the bar. When he reaches it, he claps a couple of people on the shoulder, who make way for him. He vaults back over the top, walks down the bar, and stops in from of an attractive white woman sitting on a bar stool and sipping a brandy.</context>
      <utterance>Right. I'm from Detroit  It's a big city up north with tall buildings.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT? Enough to light Las Vegas for how long? How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but--</utterance>

   <speaker>MEURICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Marty loses his glare and his gaze drifts over to the woman. After an awkward pause, Meurice clears his throat.</context>
      <utterance>I don't know, didn't he call?</utterance>
   <speaker>MEURICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She is unselfconsciously returning Marty's stare.</context>
      <utterance>...Marty, I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine, Debra. Debra, this is Julian Marty, the dude I'm always talking about.</utterance>

      <utterance>You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.</utterance>
   <speaker>DEBRA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Marty smiles bleakly. Debra drains her glass as Meurice returns. He sets another Cognac in front of Debra, and a glass of milk in front of Marty.</context>
      <utterance>You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.</utterance>
