      <utterance>Man. They look woebegone and far away.</utterance>

      <utterance>I'll only be here twenty-four hours.</utterance>

      <context>Macreedy nods his thanks. The conductor signals the engineer (o.s.) and steps on the train. The diesel's claxon blasts the torrid air ominously. The train slowly, smoothly, begins to move, picking up speed. The cars slip past until, quite suddenly, the Streamliner is gone. For a moment Macreedy watches it. Then, quite unconsciously, he takes a package of cigarettes from his left hand pocket, taps the last one free of the pack, sticks it between his lips and, crumpling the empty pack, drops it beside the tracks. He takes a cardboard book of matches, flicks it open, bends a match in half with agile fingers, and with a sure frictional motion scrapes the head against the sandpaper guard. The match flares, the cigarette is lit. Macreedy inhales, exhales deeply, and turns to pick up his suitcase. Then he sees Hastings, who walks slowly, almost painfully, to him. His Adam's apple grapples protestingly with his collar. After a moment he controls it sufficiently to talk...</context>
      <utterance>In a place like this, it could be a lifetime.  Good luck, Mr. Macreedy.</utterance>
   <speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You for Black Rock?</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREEDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's right.</utterance>
   <speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>There must be some mistake. I'm Hastings, the telegraph agent. Nobody told me the train was stopping.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREEDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They didn't?</utterance>
   <speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I just said they didn't, and they ought to. What I -- want to know, why didn't they?</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREEDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Probably didn't think it was important.</utterance>
   <speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Important?! It's the first time the streamliner stopped here in four years.  You being met? You visiting folks or something? I mean, whatd'ya want?</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREEDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I want to go to Adobe Flat. Any cabs available?</utterance>

      <utterance>Adobe Flat?!  No cabs.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREEDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hastings looks at him blankly. The thousand-yard stare of a hypnotic glazes his features.</context>
      <utterance>Where's the hotel?</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREEDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hastings points.</context>
      <utterance>I asked where's the hotel?</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREEDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>With his suitcase, he cuts across a weedy path, running into Black Rock's single street. For a moment, Hastings stares after him; then he breaks hurriedly, entering telegraph agent's shack.</context>
      <utterance>Thanks.</utterance>

   <speaker>SMITH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't know. People are always looking for something in this part of the West. To the historian, it's the "Old West." To the book writers, it's the "Wild West." To the businessmen, it's the "Undeveloped West." They all say we're backward and poor, and I guess we are.  We don't even have enough water.  But this place, to us, is our West.  I just wish they'd leave us alone.</utterance>

      <utterance>I don't think that'll be necessary. You're so scared now you'll probably drown in your own sweat.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Macreedy rises to go out. As he passes Coley, Coley takes his limp left arm and spins him slowly but firmly around. The two men face each other.</context>
      <utterance>Before that happens, couldn't I pick a fight with you if I tied one hand behind me...?</utterance>
   <speaker>COLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Macreedy shakes free of Coley's grasp. Coley lunges. His big right fist streaks toward Macreedy's face. Macreedy ducks, weaving with the punch. He grabs Coley's belt, twisting Coley's body. The momentum of the swing throws Coley off balance. As he goes past Macreedy, the stranger tugs at his belt, twisting him to one side. He plants his left foot firmly on the toes of Coley's left boot, for a split second anchoring Coley in place. He chops the under side of his open hand in a short, vicious arc that lands solidly under Coley's ear. With the same motion, he brings the heel of his hand hard against and slightly under the tip of Coley's nose. The cartilage shatters. Blood spills down his face. Following through, Macreedy's elbow smashes beneath Coley's cheekbone. Macreedy's arm goes past the astonished, wind-burned face, finding Coley's right wrist. He jerks the wrist out and backward. It snaps. Coley whimpers, his face twisted in pain and perplexity. His body lolls forward. Macreedy steps back. He raises his right shoulder a few inches. His bent right arm drives up like a piston attached to the shoulder's lift. Fist and arm seem all one rigid piece with only the limber shoulder giving them motion. The fist strikes Coley's face, covering for a moment one side of his chin and a corner of his mouth between cheekbone and jawbone. Coley shuts his eyes and falls unconscious. Smith, a puzzled expression on his face, watches Coley fall. He takes half a step toward him. Macreedy looks at Smith. Smith stops. Macreedy's face is wooden, with a trace of sullenness around the hard lines of his mouth. Working methodically, Macreedy frisks Coley. He takes from a pocket a long, ugly knife. He snaps the spring and the four-inch blade leaps into place. He looks at the knife in his hand and then at Smith. He smiles gently, even dreamily.</context>
      <utterance>If I tied both hands...?</utterance>
   <speaker>SMITH</speaker>

      <utterance>So are you.  Whatever happens -- you're lost.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You got things a bit twisted...</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREEDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>With a quick motion, he tosses the knife to Smith. Smith catches it.</context>
      <utterance>You killed Komako. Sooner or later you'll go up for it. Not because you killed him -- in this town you probably could have gotten away with it -- but because you didn't even have the guts to do it alone. You put your trust in guys like him...  ...and Hector -- they're not the most dependable of God's creatures. Sooner or later they'll get the idea you're playing them for saps. What'll you do then -- peel them off, one by one? And in the meantime if any one of them breaks, you'll go down hard. Because they got something on you. Something to use when things get tough.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREEDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He walks past Smith and goes out the door. Self-consciously holding the knife, Smith turns to face the loafers at the bar. They say nothing; they stare at him, through him, like a panel of ghouls. The door opens, admitting Sam and Doc, who carries his little black medical bag. Doc looks at Coley.</context>
      <utterance>And they're getting tougher every minute.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOC</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He goes to Coley, bending down over him. Smith has remained motionless as a monument. Now he doubles shut the knife in his hand. He pockets it, and without even glancing at Coley, turns quickly and goes out.</context>

He holds out a Postal Telegraph form. Smith puts down his paper and takes it. Macreedy, followed by Doc, goes over to Smith. Tim in his stockinged feet joins them. Smith scans the message. He looks up to meet Macreedy's gaze. Smith rises. Hector swaggers over from the slot machine.

   <speaker>SMITH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He walks out, the new Sheriff strutting beside him, with Hastings in their wake. For a moment Macreedy, Doc and Tim stand in the center of the lobby. Pete eyes them non- committally and goes back to his solitaire. He glances up now and then, moving the cards with a purposeful sort of slowness, as of a more natural swiftness restrained by his preoccupation with the three men in the lobby. Macreedy is deep in thought. Abstractedly he tugs at his collar and then repeats the ritual of lighting a cigarette. Tim's shoulders are slumped. Humiliation has corroded him, flesh and soul. Even Doc is momentarily subdued; he too, feels degraded, unclean. Macreedy looks from one to the other of the good, ineffectual companions that circumstance has so haphazardly tossed his way. He takes a few steps to his suitcase, Doc and Tim trailing him; Doc, for want of something better to do; Tim, out of his deep, inexpressible need for support. Macreedy takes an untapped bottle of whiskey from his bag. He thumbs the cork loose and holds the bottle out to Tim. Tim takes a drink. The light on the clerk's desk goes on, and we are aware that day has gone and that night is falling. The pressing, fierce light has drained from the lobby, leaving a shadowy, silvery dreariness. The shadows have lengthened and the silver has tarnished with the darkness.</context>

      <utterance>Are you going to tell him -- or you want me to?  Smith owns Adobe Flat. He leased it to Komako -- thought he had cheated him, thought Komako could never even run stock without water. There was never any water on Adobe Flat. Komako dug a well, by hand. He must have went down one hundred and fifty feet.</utterance>

   <speaker>MACREEDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>even a barrel full washes away murder! Macreedy's hand shoots out, in a short, inexorable arc, smashing his palm across the shot glass. The whiskey bursts in a spray, the glass flies halfway across the room, shattering as it lands against something solid. Pete is stunned, Doc perplexed, at Macreedy's violence. They stare at him... Macreedy's eyes are murky. The creases between the brows over his nose are deep. His nostrils move in and out with his breathing. Pete and Doc regard him with growing uneasiness. Rage comes into Macreedy's face, turning it a painful red.</context>
      <utterance>...And it will never help -- not</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREEDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But maybe I'm wrong. Go on -- drink.  What else is left for you?!  You're as dead as Komako, only you don't know it!  You also don't know that it's not enough to feel guilty. It's not enough to confess. It's not enough to say, "Forgive me, I've done wrong."</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, that's mighty noble of you. You feel ashamed -- that's noble, too.  And four years from now you'll probably be sitting here telling somebody else you haven't forgotten me. That's progress -- you'll still be ashamed but I'll be dead.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACREEDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Pete pushes the bottle aside, too ravaged by Macreedy's words and his own thoughts to drink. He shakes his head grimly and then, with sudden decision, goes to the switchboard and plugs in a line.</context>

      <context>He drives his right fist against Smith's chin. Smith's head snaps back as far as it can go and then wobbles to rest on his chest. He collapses. Macreedy blows out his breath hard. He staggers to Liz. As he bends over her...</context>
      <utterance>I'd like to kill you now, but you caused too much pain to die quickly.  You'll be tried in a court of law. You'll be convicted by a jury. Then you'll die.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>The SOUND of running feet padding along the dirt road increases on SOUND TRACK. Macreedy turns slightly, to see Doc huffing toward him. The older man climbs the jail steps and comes to an abrupt halt, his eyes going from one to the other of the two men in the stand-off.</context>
      <utterance>Just as I took care of his buddies. Me, an' Doc, and Pete...</utterance>

      <context>Macreedy swings his rifle from Tim to Smith. Tim lowers his, stepping to one side, allowing Smith, covered by Macreedy, to enter the jail. He goes in, Doc following. Pete sits silently at Tim's desk.</context>
