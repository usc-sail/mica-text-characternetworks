      <context>It's a bullshit apology. More defensive than sincere. Just the thing that pushes Rose's buttons.</context>

      <utterance>I think there's something wrong with you. The way your brain works. I mean, what the hell? It's like you can't be trusted with anything. You just screw around all the time like it's all a big fucking game. It wasn't a game, Norah. We're not all just here for your amusement. You should have been paying attention. You should have been focused on the job.</utterance>
