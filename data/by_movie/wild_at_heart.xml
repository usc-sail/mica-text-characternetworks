      <utterance>I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God’s own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin’?</utterance>
   <speaker>LULA</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I was thinkin’ about smokin’ actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole ’em from her beginnin’ in about sixth grade.

      <utterance>It’s okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn’t have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin’ that at my parole hearin’. He was a good ol’ boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.</utterance>

      <utterance>Started he couldn’t remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin’ me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin’ the old paint off our house without usin’ a mask... But I don’t know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.</utterance>

      <utterance>Sailor ain’t a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far’s I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin’ Lula. Even there he was protectin’ her. You oughta be thankin’ him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin’ after the both of ’em. Why am I tellin’ you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened.

      <utterance>That’s true. Uncle Pooch wasn’t really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy’s? And my mama never knew nothin’ about me and him - that’s for damn sure. His real name was somethin’ kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more’n a little.</utterance>

It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off.
