      <utterance>It's part of my negotiator's oath. If there's an injured party and I can help them, I'm duty bound by my oath to do that. You can shoot me if you want, but the next negotiator in here is going to tell you the same thing.</utterance>

      <context>McCall opens his eyes. Roper's impressed.</context>
      <utterance>A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side... McCall watches him for a beat, then turns his attention back on the screen.</utterance>

      <context>He pushes her towards the cover of some machines, then crouching low to the floor, recovers the .45 from the bottom of the satchel. He heads out towards the other side of the cavernous, machine-choked building.</context>

      <context>Korda goes crazy, slamming the truck into the side of a building, trying to throw Roper, but Roper hangs on. Korda then caroms off the sides of buildings, left, right, SPARKS flying, then smashes into BOXES, CRATES, anything he can see stacked alongside the road way, but Roper stays put, clinging on with all he's got, swinging from side to side to avoid the obstacles. Then Korda SEES ahead a huge pile of BOXES, WOOD FRAMING, PALLETS, TRASH, stacked at the side of a building. He hammers the pedal, driving the right side of the truck into the pile... BOXES, WOOD, PAPER, DEBRIS flying everywhere, through the open fron window as well, Korda shielding his eyes with his arm as OBJECTS fly around in a mad flurry inside the cab...</context>
