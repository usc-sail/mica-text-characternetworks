      <utterance>Blackness. We hear:</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ready?</utterance>
   <speaker>SECOND VOICE</speaker>
      <mode>LENNY</mode>
      <context>A burst of bright white static exploding across the darkness. A high whine on the audio track gives way to street sounds and rapid breathing. AN IMAGE wavers and stabilizes: A nervous POV. We're in a car, sitting in the backseat, and we're nervous, the view swinging around, showing the street rolling by outside the windows, then whipping back to the two guys in the front seat. Our POV looks down at a SMALL RECORDING DEVICE in "our" hands. A red LED is flashing. We slip the recorder into a coat pocket.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah. Boot it.</utterance>
   <speaker>OUR VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The guy riding shotgun, LANE, is just pulling a pantyhose over his head, smearing his features into a pig-like mask. He turns, DIRECTLY TO THE LENS, pissed off.</context>
      <utterance>Okay. It's goin'. I'm recording.</utterance>
   <speaker>LANE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>waitin' till I get this fuckin thing on. You tryin' ta I.D. me, or what? He tosses another pantyhose right at us and we catch it. Our POV looks down, into the pantyhose, which comes up over our field of view. We realize: this is not some ride-along verite video. WE ARE ONE OF THESE GUYS. Real honest-to-God point of view, with no cuts, no music. This is not film, it is human experience. The driver is a Hispanic guy named "SPAZ" DIAZ. Lane is a white guy who looks very strung out. Couple of crackheads. The car is a mid-seventies barge, piebald with primer.</context>
      <utterance>Good one, dickhead. Thanks for</utterance>
   <speaker>LANE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He hands us a big stainless steel revolver. The POV looks down as our shaky hands snap open the cylinder, check the rounds, snap it closed. Diaz pulls the barge into an alley. The headlights illuminate overflowing dumpsters. A Chicano busboy is making trash runs out the back door of a restaurant, which he has chocked open. The busboy goes back inside.</context>
      <utterance>Next alley... just pull in slow.  Hurry up will ya. Here.</utterance>
   <speaker>LANE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Out of the car, quickly, our own breathing loud in our ears. We even hear our own heartbeat, racing now. Through the door, after Lane, moving fast. Into the kitchen. Fluorescent glare. The busboy turning, surprised, Lane putting the shotgun in his face. Freezing him. Lane puts a finger to his lips: "quiet" in any language. Our hand puts the magnum in the THAI COOK's face. We get them down on the greasy floor, Lane controlling them with the shotgun. He looks at us, snaps his eyes toward the front room. We hear voices as we approach the swing door. Go through. Whip pan left, then right. Scoping the layout. Low-rent THAI place. Red wallpaper. Closing time. Middle-aged Thai OWNER, by the cash-register, counting money. Young Thai WAITRESS, cleaning up. They look up, stunned, as we put the gun on them.</context>
      <utterance>Let's go.</utterance>
   <speaker>LANE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Truck entering the intersection. Everyone yelling. SPAZ cuts the wheel but too late... Clipping the truck and spinning. The street outside smearing past like the view from a Tilt-a-whirl. Then KBLAM! Hitting something, God-knows-what, and launching up and over, and-- KRUNCH! Crushing metal and an explosion of broken glass. It gets quiet and still. Tinkling glass as Lane moves. Then SPAZ is screaming. The car is upside down. Crawling out of the side window. A frenzy now. Whip pan to see the cops pulling up. Then whipping back to the wreck. The engine is burning. Flames spreading rapidly. SPAZ inside, pinned, upside down, blood pumping across his face. Our hands pulling Lane out. He comes up running. We run after him, sprinting toward the welcoming darkness of an alley. Panting breath and heartbeats and sirens and somebody yelling. Gunshots. Looking back. Cops next to their car, firing. Ahead, Lane running into shadow. Then a door opening, a man coming out of a metal firedoor. Lane grabbing him, throwing him out of the way, holding the door open as we dive through into-- A stairwell. Lane sprinting up, two steps at a time. Trying the door at the second floor landing. Locked. Shit. Running up. Dizzying whirl as we run, up and up. The POV is finally broken by a...</context>

      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Ahead, in POV we see the edge of the roof coming up. Beyond it is another building, about ten feet lower and separated by a 20 foot alley. But Lane doesn't slow down. He leaps across the void and makes it to the other building, landing in a sprawl. We reach the edge and look down. Six stories. No ladders or fire-escapes. Whip to behind us. Cops running across the roof.</context>
      <utterance>Wow... the gas tank is a nice touch. Oh, oh, end of the line boys.</utterance>
   <speaker>LANE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The POV backs up from the edge and then runs toward it... Out into the void. Moving... airborne... then... WHAM! Right into the parapet wall. Slipping down. Brick wall right in our face. Bloody fingers grabbing for a rusty piece of pipe running along the edge. Looking down... feet dangling over a sixty foot drop. A cat walking through a patch of light in the alley below, oblivious. Breathing raspy. Snapping a look up as the pipe gives way. A keening whine coming from us as we scramble to climb up but... Snapping a look down-- Walls rushing past, sound of wind, and our own raspy scream-- Ground rushing up-- Split second impression of a cat, looking up, yowling and running out of the way as-- Pavement fills frame. A burst of violent red light. Sound like a gunshot... but no echo. Only silence. And blackness.</context>

   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lenny is with a guy everybody knows as "TICK", a pale- skinned creature of the night in T-shirt and leather jacket. Tick is a bottomfeeder in the techno-underground of the near future.</context>
      <utterance>Goddamnit! You know I don't deal in snuff. How many times I hafta tell you?!</utterance>
   <speaker>TICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well you could've at least warned me. You know I hate the zap... when they die. It just brings down your whole day. Jeez, Tick.</utterance>
   <speaker>TICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>LENNY NERO is low thirties. Handsome. Charming. And you better check to see if you still have your ring after you shake with him. He is wearing an expensive Italian jacket, and what he thinks of as a "power tie." His Rolex isn't real. His greasy hair is too long and curls around his collar. He needs to shave. A little sleazy. But he has energy, and heavy street smarts. Lenny is sitting on the hood of his '97 BMW 1035i. Tick is facing him, sitting in the back of his beat-to-shit 70's van. There are a lot of tapes and tech stuff piled inside the van. Lenny has a Haliburton case open next to him, like a drug dealer. In fact the whole setup looks like a drug deal, but it's not. Though it is illegal. The case holds Lenny's personal playback deck, his trodes, and a rack of the little tapes in which he deals. They are about the size of DAT tapes, and hold about 30 minutes of sensory experience... everything a person sees, hears, and feels... recorded directly from the cerebral cortex at the moment it is happening.</context>
      <utterance>Sorry.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How'd you get the tape? Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?</utterance>
   <speaker>TICK</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig. Guy had it under a wig.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, but how'd it get to you?</utterance>
   <speaker>TICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics. My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue. So whaddya think? This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand. Right?</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tick. Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that. I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit. And my customers want uncut.</utterance>
   <speaker>TICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Fuck that! The last part's the best. You dry-dive six stories and blammo! Jack right into the Big Black.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't deal black-jack clips! It's policy. I got ethics here.</utterance>
   <speaker>TICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, when did that start? Come on, man! It's what people want to see, and you know it.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So lay it off to somebody else.</utterance>
   <speaker>TICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Tick holds up a zip-lock bag containing the Walkman-sized stainless steel CORTICAL RESONANCE RECORDER, the record deck we saw earlier in the POV. Also in the bag is the SQUID NET, a matrix of sensors designed to conform to the human head (this is different from playback trodes). The whole works are covered with congealed blood.</context>
      <utterance>Come on, Lenny. I got expenses. I got to get this rig fixed. Look at it...</utterance>
   <speaker>TICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Give me six at least. This's a good clip, here. Gets you pumpin'.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nothing happens. I'm snorin'.</context>
      <utterance>Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern.</utterance>

      <utterance>Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life. Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I said that? Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.</utterance>

      <context>Lenny turns up the radio. SELECTED DRIVE-BY IMAGES, as the talk-radio provides commentary. Lenny's car passing under glowing Santa Clauses on the light-poles. Banners proclaiming the coming "Millennium LA" festivities.</context>
      <utterance>Look, Jerr. I'm nothing if not a man of my word. I'll drop the money by tomorrow, next day latest. It's a little crazed right now. Yeah, on my mother's eyes, I swear. Thanks, buddy.  Prick.  What kinda move you call that?! Lemmings.</utterance>

      <context>Transition to a rougher section of town. Buildings roll by endlessly, tagged by gangs in graphic tribal patterns. some are burnt-out ruins.</context>
      <utterance>... it's a little after 2 am on December 30th, 1999... the second to last day of the whole darn century, and the phone lines are open. Dan from Silverlake, you're on the air.</utterance>

      <utterance>Uh, hi.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>A building is burning out of control. In the foreground, silhouetted, a drunk sleeps soundly on a bus-bench.</context>
      <utterance>So Dan, are you looking forward to the New Year?</utterance>
   <speaker>DAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A shanty-camp of homeless people under a freeway overpass. Homes made of cardboard and carpet remnants. Their lives in shopping carts.</context>
      <utterance>Not really. I mean what's the point? Nothing changes New Years day. The economy sucks, gas is over three bucks a gallon, fifth grade kids are shooting each other at recess... the whole thing sucks, right? So what the hell are we celebrating?</utterance>
   <speaker>HOST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lenny cuts him off, punching to another station, and MUSIC blasts. Something fast... a rap-metal hybrid. Anger and energy. WE CUT IN fast blitzes of images like a burst of automatic weapons fire: helicopters on patrol, people running in the streets, buildings smoldering, fists raised, shouting people, paramedics rushing a body into an ambulance, Korean store owners armed to the teeth, a body covered by a yellow plastic sheet, blood running down the gutter. Cops in riot gear, with M-16s, on patrol in a Hispanic neighborhood. BACK TO LENNY coming out of a bar with a nervous businessman. We don't hear the conversation. MUSIC OVER. Lenny palms a roll of bills from the guy as he slips a squid tape into the pocket of the businessman's suit jacket. Lenny claps him on the shoulder and walks away. Lenny's beeper goes off and he pauses to look at the number.</context>
      <utterance>You're a glass-is-half-empty kind of guy, aren't you Dan? Well I for one happen to think that us making it 2000 years is worth celebrating--</utterance>

      <context>Lenny fishes around in the glove compartment, flipping through about twenty plastic security passes for different parts of town, all bogus. He finds the right one and flips it onto the dash.</context>

      <context>And WE CUT to a burst of news videotape, enlarged, noisy, distorted... images of a great gathering in the desert, the faithful waiting for God's sign as the millennium approaches.</context>
      <utterance>Now just so the rest of us know how much time is left, when is the Rapture supposed to hit, exactly? Is it midnight New Year's Eve?</utterance>

      <context>Lenny's BMW cruises past an overturned burning car. There is no-one around. He barely glances at it. Common sight these days. If it is the end of the world, Lenny's not going to let it break his rhythm.</context>

      <utterance>I just got something in, Bobby, you might appreciate. A 211 at a Thai joint goes south, and these three scuzzballs end up in a gun-and-run. It's a beauty, two thumbs up. Parental discretion advised. I'm talking it's the master, not some stepped-on copy. One of a kind. LENNY INSIDE A GLOOMY BAR. He slides into a booth with NORM SKINNER, a paunchy guy with thinning hair who dresses too young. A pretty, stoned-looking girl is leaning against Skinner.</utterance>

      <context>CUT TO: POV of a woman writhing above us in ecstasy. Lovemaking in point-of-view. We look down, see OUR BODY, a woman's body... our hands moving over the other woman's torso. The image is dark, a primal impression. Sound of harsh breathing, rustling sheets. BACK TO LENNY in the booth with Skinner. Lenny has Skinner's tape running in a playback deck clipped to his belt, next to his pager. He is hunched over the table, "sampling" the merchandise by touching a few of the trode pads to his temple without putting on the whole headset. Like a coke dealer taking a little on the fingernail.</context>
      <utterance>Whattya got for me?</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>

      <context>TIGHT SLOWMO SHOTS... ABSTRACT: SQUID tapes and money changing hands. A SQUID tape sliding sensuously into a deck. TIGHT CU LENNY, through the windshield of his car. Neon moving over him. NEWS FOOTAGE: LAPD Aerospatiales circling, their xenon lights turning night into day, giving the impression of a futuristic war zone. INSIDE THE COCKPIT, the infrared camera shows green-screen images of people in cars, in their homes... like footage of hyenas shot at night in total darkness. The impression is of a society under siege, an occupied nation... a watched society where the camera eye and the police spotlight define our reality.</context>

      <context>A train pulls into the station with a whoosh of air. A few people board. There is only the sound of the cops' footsteps as they move along the empty platform. With a pneumatic hiss the train's doors begin to close. Suddenly Iris breaks from behind a column up ahead at a full sprint. Spreg unleashes his size 13 cop shoes, thundering along the platform to intercept her. Engelman straight-arms his pistol.</context>

      <context>We lean toward her, until her eyes fill frame as they close in a kiss. We (Lenny) keeps ours open. Our hands pull her halter over her head. Then she pulls up on Lenny's T-shirt, laughing. We see it go over our eyes, blocking the view for a moment. Then Faith kisses Lenny's bare chest. We are looking down at her, looking down across our body, Lenny's body, as Faith kisses lower, kneeling in front of us, unbuckling our belt and we-- CUT TO LENNY in the here and now. Lost in playback memory bliss. He inhales sharply behind a wave of electronically recorded pleasure. BACK TO POV. Lenny pulls Faith up to his face, kissing her, then pushing her gently to the bed, where we lie down together in a pool of sunlight slashing across the tangled sheets. She looks up, right at us...</context>

      <context>CUT TO LENNY, lost in the swirl of sensation. He touches his tongue to his fingertip. IN POV we look down at Faith as we enter her. She gasps and closes her eyes, grabbing the headboard with both hands. There is only the sound of gasping breaths, the creaking bed frame. She rocks with the rhythm of our thrusts, borne away by the intensity until she cries out. CUT TO LENNY, reliving the past, under the electrodes. He reacts to the past orgasm. The tape ends, Lenny slowly takes off the trodes. There is a tiny tear at the corner of his eye.</context>

      <context>He turns her to him. They begin to make love. Faith's face fills our field of view, eyes closed in dreamy passion. A sudden FLASH OF LIGHT. Lenny opens his eyes to see... Mace's glowing countenance. She has stopped the car, torn the trodes from Lenny's head and tossed them out the window. Now she's yanking him out of the car by his lapels.</context>
      <utterance>Make me forget it, baby.</utterance>

      <context>He quickly moves around the car and climbs in the back door. Lenny grabs his Haliburton but instead of getting out, he leans through the divider window, next to Mace.</context>
      <utterance>Get it.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mace hits a button on the dash. The privacy divider rises suddenly, pinning Lenny to the ceiling.</context>

Now Faith sees him: her reaction's a little tougher to read. Pissed off, maybe, or just tense. Tran's security force has seen Lenny coming. But they stay casual. Lenny doesn't break stride. It's like a game of chicken without cars. Beemer stands, covering Lenny with his shadow. Vita looks up at Lenny with cobra eyes. Tran gives him a glance; royalty amused by Lenny's presumption.</context>

      <context>Lenny looks at the envelope, which has "Nero" hand-printed in block letters. Tex takes a pull from a flask as he takes a squid-deck out of a drawer and sticks the tape in. He puts on the headset and pushes PLAY. IN POV we are on a beach. Early morning. We are running flat out, with the wind. Looking down... we are barefoot on the wet sand. Foaming water races up the sand and breaks around our strong male legs. Looking up again, to see our running companion... a beautiful lithe woman in shorts and T-shirt. She laughs and we speed up. An exquisite moment of pure life force. TIGHT ON TEX'S FACE... as a tear leaks from the corner of his eye. He is smiling like he is listening to beautiful music. We see the quiet magnificence of Lenny's gift. Tex opens his eyes. Looks for Lenny to say thanks: but Lenny's gone. Not a guy to hang around for thanks-yous.</context>

Tran makes a sign to Beemer, and he stands to go after Lenny. Mace, at the bar, sees the Tran-Vita-Beemer action, looks around for Lenny. Can't find him. But figures there's got to be only one reason Beemer's on the prowl: he's looking for Lenny. She whips out her cellular. CUT TO: Beemer, grabbing Lenny in a painful come-along hold and hustling him toward the back of the club. Lenny's cellular rings.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>He opens his briefcase, pops the tape into the deck, puts the Squid rig on and closes his eyes. Maybe he can forget about Faith a minute. He punches PLAY. POV SEQUENCE: the first thing we notice is that the POV is distorted visually. The colors are de-saturated. Almost black and white. Yet the detail is crisp and clear, almost hyper-real. WE ARE WALKING down a windowless hallway at a large hotel. An apparently endless row of doors. The Wearer's glance goes to the numbers on the doors from time to time. We come to a particular door. There is a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door. The Wearer moves to the room next door. Looks both ways. The corridor is empty.</context>
      <utterance>No idea.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>"Our" hands appear, quickly pulling on latex surgical gloves. They look like male hands. The snapping of the rubber is the only sound in the corridor. The POV hunches down to the lock and we see the hands go to work with lock-picking tools. Several seconds and the lock is very professionally picked.</context>
      <utterance>It's a test pattern so far.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We enter the dark room, which is vacant. The drapes are open and we see city lights. It is night. One gloved hand picks up the guest directory and looks at it in the moonlight coming in the window: the SUNSET SHERATON. The Wearer drops the directory and the hands reappear holding... a black ski-mask. He pulls it on, leaving the subsequent POV seen through the eye-holes of the mask. The Wearer now looks into a mirror on the dresser. He has avoided his reflection up until now. We see a man, dressed in a jogging suit and black fanny-pack, and of course the ski-mask. Totally anonymous.</context>
      <utterance>Alright, a little B&amp;E action.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Wearer crosses to the balcony door. Opens it quietly and goes outside, moving to the wall dividing this room's balcony from the one next door. The Wearer climbs the railing and, six stories above the pavement, slips around the wall, stepping down onto the other balcony. We hug the wall, looking furtively into the room. It is a suite. In the living room we see a woman making herself a drink at the mini-bar. She turns... It is Iris. She is wearing a T-shirt and panties. Probably ready for bed. She looks like she can't sleep. Pours the Scotch shakily. CUT TO LENNY, the streetlight washing across his face. He gets suddenly serious with a flash of premonitory dread. IN POV we see Iris go into the bedroom, out of sight. We can hear the television on in there. Using a steel jimmy the Wearer slips the latch on the balcony slider and silently opens it, slipping inside. We stalk quietly to the bedroom door, listening to her movements. Water running in the bathroom. We come around the door frame. Bedroom dark, bathed in TV glow. Iris in the bathroom, washing her face with cold water. We move toward her. Crossing the room as she reaches for a towel. We are now only a couple of feet away. She comes out of the bathroom, walking right past us, drying her face. She lowers the towel, turning away... her eyes whip back. Widening in terror. She reacts with surprising speed, diving across the bed. We go after her. Her hand goes under the pillow and comes out with a small automatic. She whips it around toward us but we grab it and twist it away before she can fire. She smashes the palm of her hand into our face and rolls off the bed, lightning-fast. We follow her as she scrambles up, running through the bedroom door. Across the living room and down the short hall to the front door. Closing rapidly on her as she somehow gets the chain off the door and gets out into the hall. Slam! We tackle her against the far wall of the corridor. Our right hand comes into view holding a small electric stunner. ZAP! We nail her right in the back between the shoulder blades. She sags to the floor, gasping. We zap her again. The Wearer's glance does a 180 both ways down the corridor... nobody in sight. We clamp our hand over Iris' mouth and drag her back into her room, locking the door. ON LENNY, reacting. Going white.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, getting good. Solid suspense build.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What is it?</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lenny goes back under the wire, seeing... WE ARE DRAGGING a semiconscious Iris into the bathroom... propping her up with her back against the white tile wall... grabbing her hands and handcuffing them one by one to the steel towel rack above her. She is moaning. And crying.</context>
      <utterance>Go to the Sunset Sheraton. RIGHT NOW! Just go! GO!</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>his own output. She's seeing what he's seeing. She's seeing herself. Iris can now see herself as the Wearer sees her... wide- eyed with terror, white-lipped, weeping. Helpless. And she can feel what he feels. The Wearer's hand goes back into the fanny-pack and pulls out something else. A black athletic headband. We slip it over her head, down over her eyes. A blindfold. Now she can only see what the wearer sees. And also from the bag we pull... a yellow plastic object. With our thumb we extend the five inch blade of the razor knife, the type with tips that can be broken off by segments when they get dull. It extends with an ominous clicking sound. We lower it toward her and cut up the middle of her T- shirt, laying it open. Exposing her torso. We then look down and slide the knife under the side band of her panties, slicing them off. We put the knife up to her throat, and she whimpers, afraid to cry out, and then we draw the flat side of the blade across her body as if to tease her with the prospect of her death. MACE LOOKS AT LENNY'S EXPRESSION of dawning horror and pulls the car to the curb about a half-block from the Sunset Sheraton. Lenny is hyperventilating, shifting in his seat as if ants are crawling over him. He is experiencing the stalker's exhilaration. IN POV we see the Wearer pull his jogging pants down below his knees (R-rated please) and reach for Iris. Kneeling in front of her, he pushes her legs apart and pulls her hips forward onto him, pushing into her. Iris is feeling and seeing what he sees and feels... She feels her own pain and humiliation swirling with the killer's exhilaration. ON LENNY, sweating and barely able to breath. Mace stops the tape... concerned by Lenny's reaction. He opens his eyes... Mace see the fear there, of what the tape may reveal. But he shakes his head. He has to know. He pushes her hand away and punches PLAY. IT FLOODS INTO HIS HEAD AGAIN. The sweaty, grunting horror. The stalker picks up her slit T-shirt and quickly wraps it around her neck. He knots it tight and twists one powerful hand into the knot. The muscles in his forearm look like cables as he turns the knot tighter. The stalker viciously twists the knot a full turn and the T-shirt fabric almost disappears into the skin under her jaw. Via her trodes, Iris watches herself die. Her death comes at the moment of his orgasm which is fed to her... blasting off the planet on total overload... terror, pain, death merging with ecstasy and exultation at the same instant. ON LENNY, crying out and grabbing for the trodes, but he just holds onto them, as if they are sucking his brains out of his skull.</context>

Max sits in the open door of his car ten feet away, trodes on, playing back the tape. His face is transformed into an ashen mask lit by neon... mouth open in shock.

   <speaker>CORTO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A glimmer of hope in Lenny's eye as he whips it off his wrist. Corto doesn't even look at it. Gets it over his hand about mid-way, then -- using the watch like a pair of brass knuckles -- clobbers Lenny in the face. Watch parts go flying as Corto steps away and Duncan slams Lenny up against a column. Vita weighs in... gut-punching Lenny savagely. She works him expertly, with a series of painful jabs. He sags to his knees. Not only is this painful. It's goddamn humiliating. And Duncan and Corto enjoy every second of it.</context>
      <utterance>Lemme see.</utterance>
   <speaker>CORTO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Vita grabs Lenny by his hair and pulls him up with one rock-hard arm. She is cocking back the other arm for a pile-driver punch when... Suddenly a dark shape materializes behind her. Mace drives Vita head first into the steel column. Duncan lunges in and grabs for Mace. This is a mistake. Mace doesn't fight fancy. And she doesn't fight fair. She fights to win. And she is awesomely fast. Her moves are street moves, coupled with arm-locks and come-alongs she has been trained to use as a security driver. Lenny recovers enough to size up Vita, who is still a little stunned. She has blood dripping in her eyes and can't see too well. But she charges him. And -- being the gent that he is -- he busts her over the head with a dusty old folding chair. Mace drops Duncan about the time Vita is hitting the ground, leaving... CORTO, who fumbles out a Beretta 9mm and sticks it in Mace's face. He sniggers, loving the upper hand.</context>

   <speaker>MACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And like a jerk, he looks. She snaps sideways in a headfake and closes blindingly fast, twisting the gun out of his hand. She continues to twist his wrist brutally and Corto goes down to one knee, groaning. She takes his Beretta and backhands the barrel hard across his face. Mace releases his wrist and he crumples in a heap. She and Lenny back out the door. Then Lenny runs back in and kicks Corto in the ribs.</context>
      <utterance>Safety's on.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACE</speaker>

      <context>CUT TO LENNY AND MACE returning to the limo. As they reach the car they are hit by two flashlight beams. It is the two cops, SPREG AND ENGELMAN, out of uniform, but looking very serious with their pistols aimed at Lenny and Mace. They have been following Lenny, knowing sooner or later he would lead them to the tape.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>And you see in his eyes that it isn't going to go that way. Spreg edges forward and takes the tape. Then he points his pistol at Lenny's head, about to fire-- Which is when the pissed-off Rottweiller shoots through the open gate like a black torpedo and tears into Engelman's leg. Engelman screams in pain. Mace twists out of his grip. Engelman shoots the dog. Lenny swings up his Haliburton, using it as a shield, and dives for the car. The case takes three rounds from Spreg's 9mm before Lenny gets behind cover. Mace just seems to vanish. She reappears over the trunk of the limo and puts two rounds squarely into Spreg's chest, knocking him down. Lenny and Mace scramble into the car, starting it up. Spreg sits up, pulling up his shirt to make sure his body armor stopped the slugs. No blood. He comes up firing. He and Engelman empty their magazines at the limo as it pulls away. No damage. They realize the limo is a bullet proof security model and run to their pickup truck, parked nearby, to give chase. Spreg's face is a mask of rage. He slams the truck in gear and accelerates after the limo before Engelman even has the door closed.</context>

      <context>THE LIMO slides broadly through a turn, side slamming a parked van. Mace accelerates. The truck stays with them. Engelman is leaning out the passenger side window with an AK-47 assault rifle. He rips off several burst which riddle the limo, cracking the glass in starburst patterns. The Lexan-laminated windows are cracked to hell, but the rounds don't come all the way through. Spreg's truck comes alongside, ramming them. The impact drives them sideways. Mace swerves to miss a light- standard and finds herself roaring between warehouse buildings which front the harbor. The truck stays right with them. Engelman fires bursts at the tires, shredding them off the rims. The limo thunders along on steel rims, throwing rooster-tails of orange sparks. Mace finds herself boxed in by the buildings. No way to turn. Ahead is a short concrete pier. She hits the brakes and the limo skids on its rims out onto the pier, stopping before it reaches the end. They are trapped.</context>

      <context>They'd never get here in time anyway. Mace has reloaded her Sig and is trying to open the door on her side (away from the bad guys). It is jammed from the sideswiping. Spreg reaches into the bed of the truck and pulls out a gallon gas can. He uncaps it and throws it across the pavement. It slides under the limo, glugging its contents onto the ground. Spreg grabs a road-flare from under the seat of the truck and strikes the cap, lighting it. He tosses the flare under the limo... KA-WHOOMPH!! The gas can explodes in a fireball. The Continental is engulfed in flames. From the inside all Lenny and Mace can see is fire. All the windows are covered in roaring flames.</context>

A fireball plunging in a meteoric arc into the oily black water. Inside, they are slammed forward by the impact. The car sinks. UNDERWATER: The car hits bottom, twenty feet down, sitting there amid the junk. Shafts of light play down from the big streetlights at the end of the pier. INSIDE, Lenny and Mace are in a flooding black tomb.</context>

      <context>He nods. BLAM!! She blows the trunk latch into shrapnel. The trunk lid belches open in a whoosh of bubbles. Lenny and Mace kick out, heading toward the lights of the pier. ON THE SURFACE: Mace breaks the surface slowly alongside the slimy concrete wall. Lenny comes up beside her, spluttering. Her hand goes over his mouth. They are in the inky shadows under a massive bumper made of rail-road ties. Engelman and Spreg are standing above them, scanning the black water over the barrels of their AKs.</context>

      <context>They run back to the truck and high-tail it out of there. Down below, Lenny and Mace are clinging to the pier, chest-deep in the water. They hear the truck pulling away.

They are amorously entwined. Then they are all laughing and passing around a bottle of Jim Beam. The car stereo is thumping loudly. Iris' POV swings around and looks down, seeing Jeriko's hand caressing her thigh. She puts her hand on his chest and leans close to him.

Looking back... here come Spreg and Engelman down the embankment, overtaking us. We hear the thunder of a train... spinning again to look forward. Freight-train doing fifty on the nearest track. Almost to us. We leap forward. Over the track. The diesel roars past behind us. Looking back... a black wall of moving steel. Backing away from it. We see Engelman and Spreg crouching down... trying to aim through the wheels. Hear the impotent pop of their guns over the roar of the train. Turning to run again. We see a tiny hole appear in a sign right in front of us with a metallic SPANG. Running and running. Looking back. No pursuit. Train still rolling by. Can't see the cops. Running, running. Heart pounding and lungs heaving. Sobbing sounds coming from somewhere, seeming to fill the night. Looking down... one shoe on, one shoe off. Iris' hand takes off the remaining shoe, clutches it to her chest. We move forward into the dark train-yard as--</context>

      <utterance>Tran and Jeriko weren't getting along. He was afraid Jeriko was getting ready to dump him, but he wasn't sure, so he started with the surveillance. A couple nights ago he wires up Iris and sends her and the other girl, Diamanda, over to Jeriko's table.</utterance>

Tran backhands her furiously, his face thin- lipped with rage. She crumples to the floor, sobbing. Tran keeps looking at the squid tape in his hand like it's poison.</context>
      <utterance>That night Iris calls up, freaking. She comes over and Tran watches the tape. He just loses it. He can't believe the disaster she's gotten him into. He's terrified the cops will beat it out of her who she was working for, and come looking for him.</utterance>

Behind them we see Corto and Beemer hurling partiers aside, cutting a swath, while Vita moves like a mongoose through tall grass. Mace drops back, going tail-end- Charlie... her bodyguard mode kicking in. ON LENNY AND FAITH, charging through the jostling crowd, Lenny is looking back, then he looks ahead and... TRAN is right in front of him. In the whirling shapes and colors of the crowd, he is an island of composure in a white tux. He holds a glass of champagne in one hand, the bottle in the other. In one lightning-fast move he uppercuts with the bottle, clipping Lenny under the jaw. Faith screams as Lenny staggers. Tran swings again, smashing the bottle over the back of Lenny's head. Lenny sprawls on the floor amid champagne foam and glass. Lenny, blood flowing in his eyes, rises blearily to see Faith being pulled away by Tran, who has her arm twisted viciously behind her back. They go around a chain-link divider and double back, heading for the exit. Lenny staggers to the chainlink, sagging to his knees again as Faith passes within a few inches of him. He slips down the chainlink, into unconsciousness, as her image is lost in the pounding darkness. Mace gets to him through the crowd, and then whirls like a cat as the Posse arrives. She stands guard over him like a rabid dog, her .380 auto straightarmed and covering them expertly. Corto eyes her with hatred. The stitches on his nose and the bruised swelling are a reminder of his last run-in with her. He backs off.</context>

      <utterance>Lenny... shutup. Just park your mouth and listen. It's a set-up. Think about it! Why's he been sending you tapes? To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion. This guy's bent enough to think of that.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He reaches into his wardrobe bag... pulling out the box of "Faith" tapes and setting it aside, then pulling out the suit. Mace's frustration explodes as anger. She grabs his shoebox full of tapes. Holds them up to him.</context>

   <speaker>MACE</speaker>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>And she's out of the car, leaving the keys, ignoring the protesting horns behind her. And we see that she's wearing a short black cocktail dress. Lenny comes around the car, through the wild crowd. He's in his other suit. Snappy. Mace unselfconsciously hikes up her dress and slips her .380 auto into a holster velcroed to her leg. She pulls the dress down and you can't see the gun, hidden between her upper thighs. In fact, it looks like she couldn't be concealing a quarter anywhere on her body. The dress is cut low at the top and high at the bottom, showing plenty of muscular legs. High heels doing great things for her calves. Her braids now loose and full, like a mane. Lenny glances at Mace and does a double take. He is caught by a sudden realization:</context>
      <utterance>That's it. Let's bail.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>detective gig didn't work out. Come on. They push their way through the swirling mass of humanity. Mace moving like a wedge, security training coming to the fore. The whole street is vacuum-packed with people. Filled with cars deserted in the general euphoria, an unparted Red Sea of man and machine. They will move through the various strata of society as they work their way in to the party's inner sanctum. It is like all of LA, from poorest to richest, compressed into a few square blocks. There are cops everywhere. Cops on motorcycles, cops in cars, cops in riot gear. Lenny scopes out the security at the front entrance... metal detectors, cops... plus you have to have a 500 dollar-a-plate ticket.</context>
      <utterance>Good, Lenny. I can see why the</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lenny motions toward the back of the hotel and Mace follows. They pass a uniformed cop who is standing thirty feet away, his back to them. REVERSE ANGLE: It is SPREG. His black eyes scan the crowd.</context>
      <utterance>No. They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.</utterance>

      <context>Lenny whips out his cellular and recalls Max's number. He hears the phone connect. It starts to ring. LENNY'S POV... as the crowd parts for a moment. He sees PALMER STRICKLAND talking to a city-hall type. Lenny turns away before Strickland sees him.</context>
      <utterance>Uh unh.</utterance>

   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lenny pulls the Jeriko tape out of his breast-pocket and holds it up. Mace just stares at him completely outraged.</context>

      <utterance>Exactly. That's why it's a make- able deal.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And turns away. He strides into the crowd, heading for the lobby and the elevators. ON MACE, watching him go. Wanting to run and stop him. But she's said what there is to say. She turns away, desolate and churning with emotion. The moment lengthens as she wrestles with it. You see her fury, her sadness... and her protective instincts. Her resolve fails her. Ultimately, she must protect him if she can.</context>
      <utterance>Look. That tape is a lightning bolt from God. It's worth more than you, more than me, more than Faith. You understand? It can change things. Things that need changing before we all go off the end of the road. And you do not have the right to use it for currency.  You go... you go alone. This is where I draw the line. I care about you Lenny... a lot more than you know... which makes us both pretty stupid. But you pawn that tape, you mean nothing to me. Lenny doesn't know what to say. Tough choice. He clenches his jaw...</utterance>
   <speaker>MACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She turns, running toward the lobby. And... BOOM. Slams into him. He came back. Lenny takes her hand and puts the tape in her palm. Closes her fingers on it.</context>
      <utterance>Ah, hell. Lenny--</utterance>

He staggers back, surprised and dazed, and Lenny knees him right in the gut as hard as he can. He drops to his knees, sucking wind. Lenny draws his Glock and puts it behind Beemer's ear, pulling a pair of handcuffs off his belt. Okay, we're starting to believe he might have been a cop once.</context>

      <context>She slams her foot down on Duncan's instep and snaps her head back simultaneously in a reverse head-butt. He keeps the hold. Mace drives her free hand back into the approximate position of his nuts. Even though Duncan looks like he bench-presses Buicks, this has the desired effect. Mace jerks away from him, shoving him back through a buffet table. Vita draws a knife in a lightning move but... Suddenly Mace is standing there with her dress hiked up and her pistol straight-armed, with the muzzle right in her face. Vita says the smartest line of the night.</context>

   <speaker>FAITH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>THE RECORDING STOPS, in a blast of static. Lenny jerks at the discontinuity in the input, he is so keyed up. THE RECORDING RESTARTS: A new image resolves out of static. Faith is pushed roughly down on the bed. We climb onto the bed, straddling her, and she gasps. We turn her onto her back. She has been blindfolded. The Wearer goes SSSHHH. A warning. Like the hiss of a snake. Our hands seize her wrists and handcuff them one by one to the iron frame at the head of the bed. The hands go out of sight and then reappear holding a set of trodes. They are placed on her head... the spidery gecko-hand device almost disappearing in her black hair. LENNY'S guts have turned to water. He is shaking his head in horror...</context>
      <utterance>Oh. I didn't hear you come in.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>IN POV we see one of our hands come up holding the yellow plastic razor knife. The blade clicks out to its full length. Our hands reach down and slowly slit her dress open, starting between her breasts and going down out of sight. She groans, squirming away from the cold knife. The killer's hands open the material, exposing her white body, which in his peculiar vision is pure ivory. The knife deftly cuts off her panties. We unbuckle our pants and reach for her, grasping her hips, pulling her to us. ON LENNY, gagging. Overcome by revulsion and horror, mixing obscenely with the pleasure flooding into him from the tape. BACK TO POV as we pull our belt out of the belt loops of our pants and wrap it around Faith's neck. Faith begins to pant in tiny rapid breaths. We tighten the belt slowly. LENNY tears the trodes from his head. He clutches his stomach, gasping for breath. Carrying the playback deck, he staggers into the bedroom... to the bed. He stares wildly around the room. One whole wall of the bedroom is mirrored. In the mirror he spots a shape, on the floor beyond the bed. It is covered in the bed sheet, but it is clearly a human form, propped up against the wall on the far side of the night stand. He missed it in his earlier look from the bedroom door. Lenny moves around the bed and reaches down to the foot of the figure, grasping the edge of the sheet with a trembling hand. With horrified apprehension he pulls on the sheet. It reveals the head and upper body of... Tran Vo. The last thing he expected. Lenny leans close and sees that Tran is breathing shallowly, but his eyes are vacant. He looks like Tick did. Lenny sits on the bed and puts the trodes back on. The fireworks and screaming outside sound like some nightmarish war, like the sound of the world coming to an end. But all Lenny cares about is what's on the tape. He hits PLAY. THE POV CONTINUES where it left off. Faith's body lurches with the Wearer's thrusts. His hand tightens the belt. Lenny feels the climax building. Faith's body shakes as the killer comes... she cries out herself, in pain... or is it? The killers hand releases the belt. We see Faith gasping for breath and moaning. Suddenly the POV whips sideways to the mirrored closet doors along one wall. In the mirror is a reflection of the bed and on it Faith. And on her...</context>

THE POV CONTINUES as Max's eyes whip around in response to a sound behind them. The bedroom door is opening. Tran is standing there, stunned. Maybe the first time he's ever been surprised in his life. What a way to start. Like lightning we are off the bed snatching our .45 from the night stand and whipping around... putting the muzzle right in Tran's face. We pull him roughly across the room, too stunned to resist.</context>

      <context>Max looks out the window at the fireworks. Waits for a flash, knowing that the bang will follow. Keeping his own .45 on Lenny, he aims Lenny's Glock at the catatonic Tran. BLAM! One right into Tran's forehead. The crack of thunder from the fireworks masks the sound.</context>
      <utterance>What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You just did.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Jesus!</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Max sticks Lenny's Glock in his waistband, keeping his own .45 trained on Lenny. Lenny knows the next bullet is for him. He does what he does best... talk.</context>
      <utterance>You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die. Shit being number one.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So... I killed Tran. Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>CUT TO FAITH in the living room, moving silently up to the edge of the door frame. She looks through the crack between the door and the jam. Her POV: Max with the gun on Lenny.</context>
      <utterance>That's pretty much the way it happened.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>I killed Iris too, didn't I?</context>
      <utterance>Wait a minute. Now I'm remembering.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's right. They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment. The one I left for you at the club was a copy.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Was I a really busy guy? Did I do Tick too?</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lenny drops the cutesy role.</context>
      <utterance>You bet. Did you like it?</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>CU FAITH, reacting to this.</context>
      <utterance>So why Max... why d'ya have to do Iris? She never hurt anybody.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody. It's too perfect.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I won't say anything.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lenny nods. Starting to see it.</context>
      <utterance>I know. So, I'm working for this puke, right? And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Only he doesn't know about me and Faith. So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else. And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase. So to buy time, I do the skank. I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall. And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No plan is perfect, Lenny. Hey, cheer up. World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>CUT TO: The Underground Garage, where Tick has been cooked-off. We see Max running his number on Mace and Lenny. Lenny buying it.</context>
      <utterance>You got froggy on me a couple times.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>AND BACK again to REAL TIME.</context>
      <utterance>I thought that riff about the Death Squad was pretty good. I hadda keep you from bringing the cops into it.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So there never was a death squad.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Naawww.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>CUT TO: A brief, violent flash from the Jeriko tape: Spreg shoots Jeriko.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah. Pretty zany, huh? All this shit caused by a random traffic stop. Hey... nothing means nothing. You know that. Look around... the whole planet's in total chaos. You gotta take what you can, while you can. Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back a your head any second.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How did you hook up with Faith?</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right? But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...</utterance>
   <speaker>FAITH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>'So, do you enjoy watching me?' Max turns and sees her in the doorway.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.</utterance>
   <speaker>FAITH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know. I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?' And you said -- come on Max.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I said, 'Yeah. I'd even do it for free.'</utterance>
   <speaker>FAITH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lenny looks between Faith and Max, feeling like the asshole of the western world. Faith moves up close to Max. She puts her hands lightly on his shoulders, caressing them. Max grins, realizing she is 100% with him.</context>
      <utterance>Uh huh. And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me. I acquired the taste from Lenny.'</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'</utterance>
   <speaker>FAITH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>'We might as well make the best of it.'</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Faith runs her hands appreciatively over Max's shoulders and arms. Then, in an eyeblink, she grabs his forearm in both hands and deflects the gun.</context>
      <utterance>Jesus, Faith.</utterance>
   <speaker>FAITH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lenny jumps in, wrestling Max for the gun. Faith pulls the Glock out of Max's waistband and throws it across the room.</context>
      <utterance>Lenny!!</utterance>
   <speaker>MAX</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>BLAM! BLAM! Max fires wildly, trying to hit Lenny, who is just barely keeping the muzzle out of his face. Faith grabs Max's hair, trying to pull him away... His "hair" comes off in her hands. A prosthetic wig, containing the squid-net array. Max's head is shaved to a Sinead O'Connor stubble. He looks demonic, grimacing with effort as he struggles with Lenny. He continues firing. The shots hit the mirrors. ANGLES of the reflected images of them shattering. Faith, screaming, reflected, her face fragmenting into shards. The crystal chandelier shatters, reigning glassy snow on them from above. Max is stronger and heavier than Lenny, but Lenny has one advantage: Max has managed to make him really angry. Lenny gives a guttural cry and drives Max backward into the doorframe. They tumble together into the living room, falling together over the couch. Lenny pounds Max's hand against the glass coffee table, shattering it. He forces Max's hand along a glass edge, cutting it, and Max drops the gun. Lenny reaches for it, but Max kicks it away a split-second before his hand touches it. It skitters under the couch, out of play. Max punches Lenny brutally in the face, then in the gut, and grabs him with both hands. He hurls him against the wall. Lenny staggers off the wall into several vicious punches from Max. We feel the tide turning. Lenny goes down to one knee. Max pulls out his knife and flicks it open. Lenny throws a lamp. Max ducks and charges through. Lenny spins away from the downthrust. The knife embeds itself in his shoulder blade, sunk into the bone. Lenny punches Max in the throat and jerks away, pulling the knife handle out of Max's hand. Max tackles him and they crash together through a sliding glass door onto the balcony. Explosion of flying glass. Max pulls a dazed Lenny to his feet and rushes him backward toward the railing. At the last instant, Lenny twists with all his strength and spins Max into the railing, using his weight against him. He pushes hard and Max topples. As he is going over, Max grabs Lenny's tie, pulling him over. Max is dangling 12 stories above the oblivious crowd, his entire weight hanging from Lenny's tie. Lenny has one arm and one foot hooked around the railing, and he is being strangled by the tie. Lenny is starting to black out. In agony he gropes with his free hand to his own shoulder blade, finding the handle of the knife. He jerks it out of himself. Max sees it coming a split second before it happens. Lenny slashes the knife across the tie, just above Max's hands. Max takes the express elevator to Hell. He hits 12 stories down, on top of a video truck. Lenny stands there panting, bleeding down the back of his jacket. Faith runs to the railing and looks down. All the strength goes out of her legs. She sags to the floor. Fireworks continue to boom across the sky. Lenny looks down at her, gazing at the object of his quest. She looks up at him, her wet eyes seemingly at the bottom of a deep well from which he cannot save her. He turns and walks away. It's hard. But he keeps walking.</context>

   <speaker>MACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He slowly drops to the pavement, face down. Now that she's got them both proned out, she quickly handcuffs one of Spreg's hands to one of Engelman's. The crowd of partiers stares. Can't believe what they're seeing. Mace takes Spreg's cuffs and attaches his other wrist to the base of the tower. That's when THREE LAPD COPS in riot gear burst through the surrounding crowd and see a black girl crouching over two of LA's finest with a police baton. The cops advance toward her.</context>
      <utterance>All the way down! RIGHT NOW!!</utterance>
   <speaker>MACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The nearest shoots her with a tazer. She spasms and goes to her hands and knees. One of the cops kicks her down. She cries out, trying to explain, but she can't get the breath as the batons start to fall. The crowd around them watches fascinated, gasping. Mace sees another cop arrive and start to uncuff Spreg.</context>
      <utterance>Wait. Let me tell you what's going on here--</utterance>

   <speaker>STRICKLAND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lenny pushes through from behind Strickland. He runs to Mace and kneels next to her.</context>
      <utterance>Get some medical attention for this woman.</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A trickle of blood runs down her face. She nods weakly and reaches for him. They hug, then they both wince in pain. Mace sees the cops running in to arrest Spreg and Engelman. One of them unhooks Spreg from the tower.</context>
      <utterance>Are you okay?</utterance>
   <speaker>MACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ENGELMAN LUNGES, grabbing a gun from the holster of the closest cop. He waves them back with it. Then puts it in his mouth and fires. He topples against Spreg, spraying him with his spurting blood. Spreg clutches him, lowering him to the ground, bathing in his blood. You see him going insane, right at that moment. His face is suddenly demonic. SPREG, the street-monster cop, RISES IN SLOW MOTION. His glare is fixed on Lenny and Mace. He has Engelman's gun in one blood-drenched hand. Lifting the dead weight of Engelman by the handcuff, he begins to drag the body, lurching toward Mace. He keeps the pistol down along his side. Spreg exists at the center of a circle of cops who don't know what to do. He has a gun so they can't rush him. But he's a cop, so they can't shoot him. Several officers shout at him to drop the weapon. You barely hear them over the pandemonium of the crowd, the helicopter, the fireworks.</context>

      <context>CUT TO SEVERAL MINUTES LATER. Mace and Lenny are being escorted through the crowd by Strickland and a number of cops who part the rowdy mob before them. Lenny and Mace are both limping, bruised, cut up. Lenny's arm is drenched with blood from his shoulder wound. They support each other like two soldiers after a battle. Mace sees Faith... FAITH, escorted by a couple of cops, passing near them. She is in handcuffs and her eyes are dull. Mace turns back to Lenny...</context>
      <utterance>Yeah, what?</utterance>
   <speaker>MACE</speaker>

      <utterance>Are we under arrest?</utterance>
   <speaker>LENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They pass DEATH, with the (plastic) BABY still in his arms. Life out of Death in the endless continuum. Lenny pushes the scythe out of the way so they can get past. They reach a row of police cars and an ambulance. The EMT guys run to Lenny, helping him painfully out of his suit jacket. Strickland motions Mace toward a waiting squad car. Lenny sees... The CLOCK MIME, who smiles at him and puts his hands at midnight. We hear a roar passing through the crowd. A huge chanting and cheering, that becomes thunderous as everyone begins to shout the countdown to midnight.</context>
      <utterance>Naw. They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.</utterance>

   <speaker>MACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>TRACKING WITH LENNY as he walks toward the ambulance. They open the back door for him. The walk is hallucinatory... with confetti falling like snow, and the hysteria of the crowd. He looks back at Mace as the paramedics help him up into the ambulance. The back doors close. ON MACE, watching him go. A cop gently takes her arm, opening the squad car door for her. She turns away, her face sad amid the exultation of the crowd. She gets into the back seat. The door slams. Strickland gets in next to her. The driver starts the car. They start to move, and... There is pounding on the glass, startling her, and... The door is wrenched open... A hand comes in, grabbing her arm, pulling her out... Lenny. His eyes are full of emotion. He grabs her in his arms, fiercely, and kisses her... like there's no tomorrow. She grabs his head and won't let him break, even if he wanted to, which he doesn't. Strickland, in the car, rolls his eyes and looks at his watch. Reflex. Because if there's one time you don't need a watch, it's...</context>
      <utterance>Yeah. See you there.</utterance>
