      <context>O'Ryan silences him... by holding up a piece of paper. On it is a DRAWING. The image faces away from us. But Speck can see it in rich detail. And his eyes go wide. We catch GLIMPSES: The color of flesh. A body-part. Looks like a rendering of a young, naked WOMAN. And, just like that, Speck finds himself STARING. Glued.</context>

      <context>An abandoned SPORTS PAGE tells us about that World Series, so we must be mid-October. Charlton heads out. Mackelway throws a briefcase on to the desk, setting up his world: A framed picture of himself and his BROTHER, ages 10 and 15, on a childhood camping trip. Address book, coffee-warmer, calendar, a baseball covered with autographs. He opens up a drawer, and casually tosses two bottles of BUFFERIN into the back of it. ...but first grabs four tablets from one of the bottles, and throws them down his throat, as:</context>
      <utterance>Good.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRIEVES</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>Mackelway turns. BILL GRIEVES stands here, holding a white grease-stained paper-bag. Grieves is Mackelway's age, not quite as ambitious. But solid, decent.</context>
      <utterance>Ya like Frito Pies?</utterance>
   <speaker>MACKELWAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Grieves pulls out a greasy concoction that's wrapped up like a semi-burrito. Pure Texas. Tosses it to Mackelway:</context>
      <utterance>I dunno. What are they?</utterance>
   <speaker>GRIEVES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Grieves passes by with a faint smile, handing out lunch to a few other agents. Mackelway eyes the still-wrapped Frito Pie. God, get me outta here...</context>

   <speaker>DYLAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Charlton eyes the report, then hands it to Mackelway. The hierarchy is being made clear. Very. Mackelway turns: this ravine runs right up against a SIGN that reads "Welcome to Texas" on one side and "You are now leaving Oklahoma" on the other. A vehicle, left right on the state-line. Odd... Then, a NOISE: that Tow-Truck WINCH, grinding badly. It's just about to yank the Buick out of this ditch.</context>
      <utterance>Fella's name is Harold Speck. Traveling salesman, from Abilene.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACKELWAY</speaker>

      <utterance>Sorry, Sir. There wasn't time.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Charlton starts down the embankment. Mackelway doesn't, hanging back as he eyes the TRACKS this Buick made before tumbling. Something about them... He pulls a small CAMERA from his pocket, a Minox. Snaps off a few photos of the scene - the Buick, the ravine, those tracks, some FOOTPRINTS alongside them. Then he heads down the 15-foot embankment.</context>
      <utterance>Did the right thing, Agent Mackelway. Let's have a look.</utterance>

   <speaker>CHARLTON</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>Charlton is opposite him, outside the passenger-side window, pointing at the DRAWING that O'Ryan had tossed onto Speck's lap. It lies face down on the seat. But something's been FINGER-PAINTED on the back of it: A RED CIRCLE, with a SLASH through it. Charlton begins to reach for it, when:</context>
      <utterance>What's that?</utterance>
   <speaker>MACKELWAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Charlton stops. Mackelway indicates: "Gloves."</context>

   <speaker>CHARLTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>That was a jab, but we don't know it yet. Charlton puts on his gloves. Mackelway snaps off a few more shots with that Minox, looking over the rest of this car, as:</context>
      <utterance>I imagine you would be.</utterance>
   <speaker>JUMBO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mackelway shakes his head. "Shitkicker." Granger grabs the crowbar. He's just about to open the trunk as:</context>
      <utterance>You said toss it.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACKELWAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Granger pauses. Mackelway crosses to the trunk, and snaps off a few shots with the Minox. Something catches his eye, along the line of the TRUNK. He kneels closer... An odd RESIDUE, crusty and hard, has formed a thin line on top of the paint in a single post. He takes out a VIAL, and scrapes some of the residue into it. Then he sniffs it. Pauses...</context>
      <utterance>Hold it a second.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACKELWAY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He looks to Granger: now you can open the trunk.</context>

   <speaker>DYLAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>So what the hell's he doin' here? That one is left unanswered. Granger opens the trunk. Mackelway and the others look inside... There, they find restaurant supplies: napkin dispensers, salt- shakers, ketchup dispensers, a short-order wheel... And a fishing reel, tackle-box, a kid's bicycle helmet. Mackelway eyes it all, but his instincts tell him there's nothing significant here. So he returns to Speck's body. He leans in, lifts Speck's head a few inches away from the steering wheel. Gently. ...which is when we learn that Speck's EYELIDS have been torn off. It's gruesome, but Mackelway notes it calmly. Charlton leans in, gets a look.</context>
      <utterance>Well now...</utterance>
   <speaker>CHARLTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mackelway is expressionless. But something about these LIDLESS EYES draws him closer. He leans in, then BAM! We are rocketed into a series of dark, disjointed images:</context>

First one we see is the TOP SHEET of a FAX: same hand-written inscription as the last one: "Attention, Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI Resident Agency, Wichita Falls." Okay. This is twice now.

Date of Disappearance: 3-22-97." The following four sheets bring four more faces: men, women, young, old. Four more HAVE YOU SEEN ME's. But before he can think it through, he hears:</context>

This is a FAX, which Charlton's just received. He points further down on the fax at what look like little squiggles at first, until we move in to discover it is a hand drawn street map. The ink bleeds a bit due to a poor fax transmission. Those scrawled lines take us to "The Hope House," in Oklahoma City. At the bottom a scribbled name, "David Dyson," and a contact number.

      <utterance>As a citizen of the world, it's hard not to. Wouldn't you say?  Evil is all around us, I think - a part of the natural order of things. Like gravity. Like wind. A vast black wave, corrupting everything it touches. A virus invades a cell, causing it to dysfunction. Perfectly logical. But did it ever occur to you that something may have invaded that virus, something capable of using it to mutate so powerfully? Mackelway pauses, considering that.</utterance>

He'd never run out of food, so he'd have no need to come to the surface. Consequently, we would never see him. Do you follow?  We'll never see one. But that doesn't mean they don't exist.

      <utterance>Some of my colleagues think I'm fascinated with evil. I think the truth is just the opposite: evil is fascinated with us. What better vehicle could there be for creating havoc in the world - what better instrument - than Man?

      <utterance>It'd be customary at this point to start praying. I hear a lot of that. Haven't seen too many answers though. I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for another janitor to break in here and save you, either. You're alone. Mackelway tries to speak. It's impossible.</utterance>

      <context>With that, he lifts that hunting knife out of the flame. It is RED-HOT. Even looking at it is painful. But Mackelway can't look at anything else.</context>
      <utterance>I know what you're thinking: "There is pain coming. Am I going to take it like a man?" Let me put you at ease: You won't. None of them do. Men, women, children. They all weep, they all beg. They pass out, they piss themselves. They attempt negotiation: You wouldn't believe how many men have lain right where you're lying right now - grown men, with wives and children back home - offering all kinds of sexual gratification in exchange for a five minute reprieve. It's pathetic. Are you afraid?  Then there's that moment when they realize there's nothing left to be negotiated. They're just mine. And they're helpless. And the look in their eyes, the level of surrender... well, it's almost pornographic. I put this mirror here because I don't want you to miss it. Are you afraid?</utterance>

      <context>There it was: the very thing Mackelway's been hearing all this time, the exact words. Unsettling as hell. ...and we begin to INTERCUT: images of this moment with images from those "VISIONS" that have been hinting at this very wheatfield since Page One... 208a INTERCUT WITH/EXT. WHEATFIELD "FANTASY" - SAME 208a Tall wheat, wet wind, O'Ryan's voice: "I'm begging you..." ...Mackelway snaps himself out of the vision.</context>
      <utterance>Do it, Mack. Please.  Please. I'm begging you.</utterance>
   <speaker>MACKELWAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>That was almost an attempt to make those images stop, to deny its awful, inevitable conclusion.</context>
      <utterance>I can't.</utterance>

      <context>Two men, neither of them flinching... until O'Ryan nods - as if to say "Good-bye." ...more of that vision interrupts now: a gun, rising... O'Ryan rears back and swings that tire-iron right at Mackelway's head. Fran has no choice. She fires. O'Ryan is hit right between the shoulder blades. The tire-iron hits Mackelway in the shoulder. O'Ryan crumbles to the ground, landing face up. ...a body slumping to the ground. O'Ryan... Mackelway stands over him... Now, real-life again, Mackelway stands over O'Ryan, just as O'Ryan had always envisioned it. That makes him smile, even as he's dying.</context>
      <utterance>Yet.</utterance>

      <context>Mackelway rises, studies Charlton. There's nothing to say. So he extends a hand to Fran. She takes it, rising to her feet. They leave Charlton behind... We PULL AWAY from them, craning up, taking in this expanse of tall wheat, TILTING UP to that morning sun.</context>
      <utterance>O'Ryan. Where is he?</utterance>
