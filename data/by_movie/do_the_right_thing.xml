The OPENING SHOT will be a TRICK SHOT--the CAMERA PULLING BACK through the storefront window.</context>

He has a very distinct walk, it's more like a bop. This is RADIO RAHEEM. The size of his box is tremendous and one has to think, how does he carry something that big around with him? It must weigh a ton, and it seems like the sidewalk shakes as the rap music blares out. The song we hear is the only one Radio Raheem plays.</context>
