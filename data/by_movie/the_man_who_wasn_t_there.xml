   <speaker>ED</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We track back from a barber's pole.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah, I worked in a barbershop. But I never considered myself a barber...</utterance>
   <speaker>ED</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We track back from a shopkeeper's bell triggered by an opening door. The pull back and tilt down show the top of the head of a customer entering in slow motion.</context>
      <utterance>...I stumbled into it--well, married into it more precisely...</utterance>
   <speaker>ED</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We track along a shelf backed by a mirror and holding pomade, aftershave, hair tonic, a whisk brush.</context>
      <utterance>...I wasn't my establishment. Like the fella says, I only work here...</utterance>
   <speaker>ED</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We track in on a big man in a barber's smock scissoring across a lock of hair that he pulls taut between two fingers of one hand. In slow motion, he laughs and chats.</context>
      <utterance>...The dump was 200 feet square, with five chairs, or stations as we call 'em, even though there were only two of us working...</utterance>
   <speaker>ED</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Another man in a barber's smock is running electric clippers across a child's head. A cigarette between his lips.</context>
      <utterance>...Frank Raffo, my brother-in-law, was the principal barber. And man, could he talk...</utterance>
   <speaker>ED</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>He plucks the cigarette from his mouth and taps its ash into a tray.</context>
      <utterance>...Now maybe if you're eleven or twelve years old, Frank's got an interesting point of view, but sometimes it got on my nerves. Not that I'd complain, mind you. Like I said, he was the principal barber. Frank's father August--they called him Guzzi--had worked the heads up in Santa Rosa for thirty-five years until his ticker stopped in the middle of a Junior Flat Top. He left the shop to Frankie free and clear. And that seemed to satisfy all of Frank's ambitions: cutting the hair and chewing the fat. Me, I don't talk much...</utterance>

      <utterance>Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...</utterance>

      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We float slowly toward a white bungalow on a quiet street as a black coupe pulls into the driveway.</context>
      <utterance>...I lived in a little bungalow on Napa Street. The place was OK, I guess; it had an electric ice box, gas hearth, and a garbage grinder build into the sink. You might say I had it made.</utterance>
   <speaker>ED</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We track in through a bedroom door to discover a woman putting on a girdle.</context>

      <context>Ann smiles wanly.</context>
      <utterance>Japs had us pinned down in Buna for something like six weeks. Well, I gotta tell ya, I thought we had it tough, but, Jesus, we had supply. They were eating grubs, nuts, thistles. When we finally up and bust off the beach we found Arnie Bragg, kid missing on recon; the Japs had eaten the sonofabitch, if you'll pardon the, uh... And this was a scrawny, pimply kid too, nothin' to write home about. I mean, I never would've, ya know, so what do I say, honey? When I don't like dinner, what do I say?</utterance>

      <context>He turns and looks through the screen door into the house. Across the dim living room we can see a sliver of the brightly lit kitchen. Big Dave, wearing a frilly apron, stands at the counter drying dishes. His broad back heaves with laughter while Doris, just hidden by the wall, chats away, handing dishes across.</context>
      <utterance>...Yeah... I guess Doris liked all that he-man stuff. Sometimes I had the feeling that she and Big Dave were a lot closer than they let on...</utterance>
   <speaker>ED</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>With the squeak of the screen door, Big Dave emerges.</context>
      <utterance>...The signs were all there plain enough--not that I was gonna prance about it, mind you. It's a free country. Footsteps approach the front porch.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ed gives a half-grin of wry acknowledgement. Big Dave relaxes, forearms against the porch railing, gazing out at the front lawn.</context>
      <utterance>Holding down the porch area?</utterance>

   <speaker>DAVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?</utterance>
   <speaker>ED</speaker>

      <utterance>All right, I guess.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE</speaker>

      <context>He chuckles.</context>
      <utterance>...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day.</utterance>

      <utterance>Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on...</utterance>

His face and knees awkwardly support his weight as if he were pushing something across the floor with his nose. He reaches a corner but still pushes forward, wedging himself in, legs still scraping away as if to push himself through the wall. Blood is pooling out from under him. Big Dave's legs are still working. His gurgling continues. Ed watches. Big Dave's legs start to move furiously. They convulse. His whole body shakes as he goes into shock. Ed watches. Big Dave stops shaking. He remains wedged awkwardly into the corner, face-down. He is still. The room is very quiet. Ed looks down at his hands. He walks across the room, pushes the door open and walks across the darkened sales floor.</context>

Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell you what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?</utterance>

      <utterance>Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.</utterance>
   <speaker>BIRDY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.</utterance>
