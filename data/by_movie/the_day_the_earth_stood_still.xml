      <utterance>Reports are coming in from all over the Empire -- from all over the world. The Government have not yet issued a statement, but there seems to be no question that there actually is a large, unidentified object circling the earth at incredible speed.</utterance>

      <context>Klaatu lets the object drop with a shrug of mild exasperation. The two lieutenants exchange a helpless look of bewilderment. Then Klaatu raises himself to his feet painfully, holding his wounded shoulder. As he does so, a colonel and a captain come into scene.</context>
      <utterance>It was a gift. For your President.  With this he could have studied life on other planets.</utterance>

      <utterance>My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.</utterance>

      <utterance>Just Klaatu.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Somewhat relieved, Harley seats himself. He speaks with a half smile, hoping to ease the tension.</context>
      <utterance>Sit down, Mr. Harley.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>About five months -- your months.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You must have come a long way.</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Harley glances at him quickly to be sure he's not joking. He's not.</context>
      <utterance>About 250 million of your miles.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The present situation?</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I mean the reasons for my coming here.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I -- I'm not sure I understand--</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You know about the United Nations?</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You must have a rather strange impression of us.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I was only hoping to make you understand.</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Perhaps if you could explain a little--</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Harley is thoroughly shaken. The tremendous force and power implicit in Klaatus's manner preclude the possibility of argument.</context>
      <utterance>I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Growing a little impatient with such nonsense, Klaatu eyes him evenly, speaks with Jovian authority.</context>
      <utterance>Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The eyes of the two men meet for a long, silent moment. Then Harley rises quietly.</context>
      <utterance>I don't want to resort to threats, Mr. Harley. I simply tell you bluntly that the future of your planet is at stake... I suggest you transmit that message to the nations of the Earth.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He turns and goes out.</context>
      <utterance>I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.  Goodnight, sir.</utterance>

      <utterance>Not very good news, I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."  "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."  Well -- there you have it. Harley extends a sheaf of cables for Klaatu's inspection, but he ignores them. Klaatu has listened to this recital,</utterance>
   <speaker>HARLEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time. Barnhardt hesitates for a long, thoughtful moment. Then he</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Barnhardt closes the door and turns to find Klaatu watching him with a faint smile. Barnhardt sinks into a chair, trying to adjust his mind.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I would like to explain something of my mission here.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That was my first question.</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes -- that is true.</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If you mean that you are afraid of us--</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>These other planets -- do they have peace and security?</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Would you care to be more specific?</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What I have to say must be said to all concerned.  It is too important to be entrusted to any individual. Barnhardt is forced reluctantly to accept Klaatu's refusal to go any further. After a moment's thought, he speaks seriously, but with a twinkle in his eye.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What -- what sort of action do you mean?</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Barnhardt stands staring at him for a moment, passes his hand across his brow. Then, as Klaatu watches, Barnhardt paces the floor, trying to digest what he has heard. After a moment, he turns to Klaatu.</context>
      <utterance>Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.</utterance>

      <utterance>One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The implications of this statement leave Barnhardt speechless, his keen mind reeling.</context>
      <utterance>I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Such power exists?</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Barnhardt stands silent for a moment, trying to collect his shattered thoughts. Klaatu watches him as he starts pacing again.</context>
      <utterance>I assure you such power exists.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes -- of course.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That can easily be arranged.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.</utterance>
   <speaker>BARNHARDT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Maybe a little demonstration.</utterance>
   <speaker>KLAATU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Klaatu's bland manner leaves Barnhardt shaken, almost wishing he'd never started this business.</context>
      <utterance>Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?</utterance>

      <utterance>Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind. Helen has reacted in puzzlement at this second mention of Barnhardt. They are interrupted by the ringing of the doorbell. Helen goes to answer it.</utterance>

      <utterance>No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>(stopping her in the doorway, his imaginative suspicions mounting) Hey Mom -- why would he want to be alone? Not wanting to go into this any further, Helen blows him a kiss and backs out, closing the door. Bobby stands thinking for a moment, his mind still speculating on all sorts of wonderful possibilities. Still preoccupied, he drifts over to his bed and sits down to take of his shoes. He drops the first one to the floor and is starting on the other, when there is a light rap on his door. The door opens and Klaatu appears.</context>
