      <utterance>Jo, come on in.</utterance>
   <speaker>JO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you, sir.</utterance>
   <speaker>GIBBS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Captain West, this is Lt. Commander Galloway. Jo, you know Mike Lawrence.</utterance>
   <speaker>JO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes sir.  Captain, I appreciate your seeing me on such short notice.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I understand there was some trouble over the weekend down in Cuba.</utterance>
   <speaker>JO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes sir... This past Friday evening. Two marines, Corporal Harold Dawson and Private Louden Downey, entered the barracks room of a PFC William Santiago and assaulted him. Santiago died at the base hospital approximately an hour later. The NIS agent who took their statements maintains they were trying to prevent Santiago from naming them in a fenceline shooting incident. They're scheduled to have a hearing down in Cuba at 4:00 this afternoon.</utterance>
   <speaker>LAWRENCE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's the problem?</utterance>
   <speaker>JO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jo lets this sink in a moment.</context>
      <utterance>Dawson and Downey are both recruiting poster marines and Santiago was known to be a screw-up. I was thinking that it sounded an awful lot like a code red.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEST</speaker>

      <utterance>Christ.</utterance>
   <speaker>JO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jo looks around the room for a response.</context>
      <utterance>I'd like them moved up to Washington and assigned counsel. Someone who can really look into this. Someone who possesses not only the legal skill, but a familiarity with the inner workings of the military. In short, Captain, I'd like to suggest that... I be the one who, that it be me who is assigned to represent them.  Myself.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Joanne, why don't you get yourself a cup of coffee.</utterance>
   <speaker>JO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you, sir, I'm fine.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Joanne, I'd like you to leave the room so we can talk about you behind your back.</utterance>
   <speaker>JO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JO gets up and walks out.</context>
      <utterance>Certainly, sir.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I thought this Code Red shit wasn't going on anymore.</utterance>
   <speaker>LAWRENCE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>With the marines at GITMO? Who the hell knows what goes on down there.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well lets find out before the rest of the world does, this thing could get messy. What about this woman?</utterance>
   <speaker>LAWRENCE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Jo's been working a desk at internal affairs for what, almost a year now.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And before that?</utterance>
   <speaker>GIBBS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She disposed of three cases in two years.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Three cases in two years? Who was she handling, the Rosenbergs?</utterance>
   <speaker>GIBBS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She's not cut out for litigation.</utterance>
   <speaker>LAWRENCE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She's a hall of an investigator, Jerry --</utterance>
   <speaker>GIBBS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>In Internal Affairs, sure. She can crawl up a lawyer's ass with the best of 'em, but when it comes to trial work --</utterance>
   <speaker>WEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>LAWRENCE goes to the door and motions for JO to come back in.</context>
      <utterance>I know. All passion, no street smarts. Bring her back in.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Commander, we're gonna move the defendants up here in the morning.</utterance>

      <utterance>Thank you, sir.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And I'll have Division assign them counsel...</utterance>
   <speaker>JO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But... not me.</utterance>
   <speaker>WEST</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>From what I understand from your colleagues, you're much too valuable in your present assignment to be wasted on what I'm sure will boil down to a five minute plea bargain and a week's worth of paper work.</utterance>
   <speaker>JO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sir --</utterance>
   <speaker>WEST</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't worry about it. I promise you, division'll assign the right man for the job.</utterance>

JESSEP's a born leader, considered in many circles to be one of the real fair-haired boys of the Corps. He's smart as a whip with a sense of humor to match. As soon as he drops the letter, he says</context>

      <context>He's talking to his two senior officers. CAPTAIN MARKINSON is in his late 40's. He's a career marine and a nice guy in a world where nice guys may not finish last, but they sure as shit don't finish first. Lt. JONATHAN JAMES KENDRICK is 26, from Georgia, and an Academy graduate.

      <utterance>Don't call the President just yet. Maybe we should consider this for a second. Maybe -- and I'm just spit balling here -- but maybe we as officers have a responsibility to train Santiago. Maybe we as officers have a responsibility to this country to see that the men and women charged with its security are trained professionals. Yes. I'm certain I once read that somewhere. And now I'm thinking that your suggestion of transferring Santiago, while expeditious, and certainly painless, might not be in a manner of speaking, the American way. Santiago stays where he is. We're gonna train the lad. You're in charge, Jon. Santiago doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness report, I'm gonna blame you. Then I'm gonna kill you.</utterance>

      <context>KAFFEE can't help but be impressed by that speech.</context>
      <utterance>I do know you. Daniel AlliStair Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate and Attorney General, of the United States, died 1985. You went to Harvard Law on a Navy scholarship, probably because that's what your father wanted you to do, and now you're just treading water for the three years you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, just kinda layin' low til you can get out and get a real job. And if that's the situation, that's fine, I won't tell anyone. But my feeling is that if this case is handled in the same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian Bazaar manner with which you seem to handle everything else, something's gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be doing my job if I allowed Dawson and Downey to spend any more time in prison than absolutely necessary, because their attorney had pre- determined the path of least resistance.</utterance>

      <utterance>Colonel, this past February, you received a cautionary memo from the Naval Investigative Service, warning that the practice of enlisted men disciplining their own wasn't to be condoned by officers.</utterance>
   <speaker>JESSEP</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I submit to you that whoever wrote that memo has never served on the working end of a Soviet-made Cuban Ml-Al6 Assault Rifle. However, the directive having come from the NIS, I gave it its due attention. What's your point, Jo?</utterance>

      <context>A moment of tense silence before --</context>
      <utterance>Take caution in your tone, Commander. I'm a fair guy, but this fuckin' heat's making me absolutely crazy. You want to know about code reds? On the record I tell you that I discourage the practice in accordance with the NIS directive. Off the record I tell you that it's an invaluable part of close infantry training, and if it happens to go on without my knowledge, so be it. I run my base how I run my base. You want to investigate me, roll the dice and take your chances. I eat breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who are trained to kill me.

      <utterance>The facts of the case are this: At midnight on August 6th, the defendants went into the barracks room of their platoon-mate, PFC William Santiago. They woke him up, tied his arms and legs with rope, and forced a rag into his throat. A few minutes later, a chemical reaction in Santiago's body called lactic acidosis caused his lungs to begin bleeding. He drowned in his own blood and was pronounced dead at 32 minutes past midnight. These are the facts of the case. And they are undisputed. That's right. The story I just told you is the exact same story you're going to hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's the exact same story you're going to hear from Private Downey. Furthermore, the Government will also demonstrate that the defendants soaked the rag with poison, and entered Santiago's room with motive and intent to kill.  Now, Lt. Kaffee, is gonna try to pull off a little magic act, he's gonna try a little misdirection. He's going to astonish you with stories of rituals and dazzle you with official sounding terms like Code Red. He might even cut into a few officers for you. He'll have no evidence, mind you, none. But it's gonna be entertaining. When we get to the end, all the magic in the world will not have been able to divert your attention from the fact that Willy Santiago is dead, and Dawson and Downey killed him. These are the facts of the case.  And they are undisputed.</utterance>

      <utterance>There was no poison on the rag and there was no intent to kill and any attempt to prove otherwise is futile because it just ain't true.  When Dawson and Downey went into Santiago's room that night, it wasn't because of vengeance or hatred, it wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't because they were looking for kicks on a Friday night. It's because it was what they were ordered to do.  Let me say that again: It's because it was what they were ordered to do. Now, out in the real world, that means nothing. And here at the Washington Navy Yard, it doesn't mean a whole lot more. But if you're a marine assigned to Rifle Security Company Windward, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and you're given an order, you follow it or you pack your bags.  Make no mistake about it, Harold Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting before you in judgement today because they did their job.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yeah, but it wasn't a order, was it? After all, it's peacetime. He wasn't being asked to secure a hill... or advance on a beachhead. I mean, surely a marine of Dawson's intelligence can be trusted to determine on his own, which are the really important orders, and which orders might, say, be morally questionable.  Lt. Kendrick?

      <utterance>Forget the flight. We'll put Markinson on the stand and we'll deal with Jessep's refusal to transfer Santiago and he'll testify to the forged transfer order. That'll be enough. That and Downey's testimony really oughta be enough.</utterance>

      <utterance>Your honor, these are the telephone records from GITMO for August 6th. And these are 14 letters that Santiago wrote in nine months requesting, in fact begging, for a transfer.  Upon hearing the news that he was finally getting his transfer, Santiago was so excited, that do you know how many people he called? Zero. Nobody. Not one call to his parents saying he was coming home. Not one call to a friend saying can you pick me up at the airport. He was asleep in his bed at midnight, and according to you he was getting on a plane in six hours, yet everything he owned was hanging neatly in his closet and folded neatly in his footlocker. You were leaving for one day and you packed a bag and made three phone calls. Santiago was leaving for the rest of his life, and he hadn't called a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. Can you explain that? The fact is there was no transfer order. Santiago wasn't going anywhere, isn't that right, Colonel.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>RANDOLPH ponders this a moment.</context>
      <utterance>Object. Your Honor, it's obvious that Lt. Kaffee's intention this morning is to smear a high ranking marine officer in the desperate hope that the mere appearance of impropriety will win him points with the jury. It's my recommendation, sir, that Lt. Kaffee receive an official reprimand from the bench, and that the witness be excused with the Court's deepest apologies.</utterance>

      <context>KAFFEE looks around the room, sees that the world is waiting for him to do something...</context>
      <utterance>Absolutely. My answer is I don't have the first damn clue. Maybe he was an early morning riser and he liked to pack in the nq. And maybe he didn't have any friends. I'm an educated man, but I'm afraid I can't speak intelligently about the travel habits of William Santiago. What I do know is that he was set to leave the base at 0600. Now are these really the questions I was called here to answer? Phone calls and footlockers? Please tell me you've got something more, Lieutenant. Please tell me there's an ace up your sleeve. These two marines are on trial for their lives. Please tell me their lawyer hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone bill.  Do you have any other questions for me, counselor? The courtroom is silenced. Jessep's slammed the door.</utterance>

You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: That Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives.  You don't want the truth. Because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me there.  We use words like honor, code, loyalty... we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use 'em as a punchline.  I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it. I'd prefer you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you're entitled to.</utterance>
