      <utterance>Where is Deacon Frost?</utterance>
   <speaker>BLADE</speaker>

      <context>Blade yanks the stake free. The vampire laughs, air whistling through his ruined larynx.</context>

      <context>Quinn responds with a slew of rapid-fire vampire invectives. Blade sees he's getting nowhere fast, calmly sheathes his sword. He unclips a white phosphorous grenade from his combat harness --</context>
      <utterance>Frost.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Blade shoves the grenade in Quinn's mouth, pulls the pin. WHOOSH! Quinn goes up like a roman candle. Blade turns, surveying his work, ignoring the howling pyre behind him: All evidence of the vampires is gone -- with the exception of a few oily-black puddles. Clothes, jewelry -- it's all been burned away by the acidic process of the creatures' accelerated decomposition. DENNIS sits huddled in a corner, having pissed his pants. As Blade approaches, he cringes back --</context>
      <utterance>You won't stop him, Blade. The Tide's rising, the Sleeper's gonna --</utterance>
   <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Blade simply grabs Dennis by the jaw, tilting his head upward, rotating it from side to side -- looking for bite marks. There aren't any. Blade moves on, leaving Dennis alone amidst the carnage. As Blade starts up the stairs, he pauses in mid-step --</context>
      <utterance>Please don't --</utterance>
   <speaker>A COCKROACH</speaker>

      <context>CURTIS WEBB, the forensic pathologist (30s, white bread, a little on the smarmy side) steps forward, unzips the bag -- It's Quinn, what's left of him, anyway. Burnt to a charcoal briquette, limbs twisted horribly, oozing fluids. Curtis turns his head, grimacing, wafting the air.</context>

      <utterance>The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.</utterance>

      <context>Curtis pulls out a penlight, flicks it on. He leans over Quinn, shining the light into one of his eyes.</context>

      <context>Quinn suddenly bolts up from the autopsy table, sinking his fangs into Curtis' jugular. He snaps the man's neck in two for easier access, sucking in blood like a living vacuum. Karen stumbles backwards, sending autopsy tools CLATTERING.</context>

It's a good thirty feet to the roof of the adjacent building, a parking structure -- and damned if Blade doesn't seem to be considering the jump. The Police close in, agitated.

      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>hobbles out of the shadows, leaning heavily on a cane. Gimlet-eyed, bitter, his right leg encased in a metal brace. Though his face is lined with wrinkles and his hair has long since gone gray, we sense he could kick the living shit out of any man half his age.</context>

   <speaker>WHISTLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Blade nods, lays Karen down on the operating table. Whistler turns on an overhead light. Karen is sheathed in sweat, ashen. She's lost a lot of blood. Whistler snaps on a pair of surgical gloves, probes the wound in Karen's neck with an antiseptic swab -- there's capillary damage around the perimeter of the wound, the tissue looks bruised, gangrenous.</context>
      <utterance>No promises. You watch her close. She starts to turn, you finish her off.</utterance>

When it's over, Quinn steps back, winded -- Blade's head hangs down. He gasps, wincing, every breath sending a red hot poker to his gut. Quinn grabs a hold of Blade's jaw, forcing his head up.</context>

   <speaker>KAREN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Karen gestures to the microscope. Blade takes a look --</context>
      <utterance>This is sodium citrate. It's an anti-coagulant. We use it to treat blood-clots sometimes. Vampire blood is thinner than humans, though. Watch what happens when I introduce some into a sample --</utterance>
   <speaker>BLADE'S POV</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Karen injects the contents of the syringe onto the slide of cells -- the reaction is immediate. The vampire blood turns black, then begins violently bubbling. Blade lifts his head away from the microscope just in time -- the blood on the slide atomizes, exploding outward in a fine mist which bursts apart the glass lens of the scope. Whistler laughs, thrilled with the results.</context>

      <context>A bead of sweat runs down Frost's neck, washing away a minute amount of the sun-blocking cream. The patch of exposed skin instantly blackens. Frost gazes upwards at the sun.</context>

Blade has a split-second to act. It's Frost or the girl -- and for a moment we actually think he's going to go for Frost -- -- but then he DIVES forward, scooping the girl into his arms, throwing themselves out of the bus' path. The bus misses them by a hair. By the time Blade looks up again -- -- Frost is gone. Blade rises, cursing, scanning the street as market-goers gather around him.</context>

      <context>What used to be Curtis SNARLS, knocking Karen back into the drift- pile of bones. It pins her to the ground, kneeling above her, gurgling through its gutted trachea.</context>
      <utterance>Curtis?!</utterance>
   <speaker>CURTIS REVENANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Karen SCREAMS, trying to force the revenant away from her, but it lunges closer, lolling its distended tongue over her mouth in a pathetic approximation of a French kiss. She fumbles behind her, choking, grabbing hold of a human femur, blindly swinging it upward -- CRACK! The blow shatters the Curtis-thing's jaw. It rears back, falling to the side. Karen crawls out from under its weight, swinging the femur again and again -- CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Karen pummels the howling horror, driving it back until the femur actually splinters in half. The creature's head hangs at an awkward angle now, its neck broken -- but still it advances, dragging itself back up. Sobbing, Karen retreats, clutching the splintered femur like a makeshift dagger. Curtis charges at her, a blur of slashing claws. At the last moment, Karen ducks, thrusting the bone dagger up into Curtis' chest -- Curtis impales himself, right through the heart. For one split- second, his eyes widen in surprise -- -- and then he goes into a death-spasm, vomiting up a spray of caustic vampire blood-bile, spattering Karen. She sinks to her knees, GASPING, as the thing that used to be Curtis shrivels up, melting away into burbling puddle. After a beat, Karen rises and moves to the pit wall, running her hands over the lichen-slick surface, searching for a way out. The mortar between the brickwork is ancient, crumbling. Karen looks to the ground, reaching for one of the splintered femurs. She pounds it into the mortar between two bricks -- and it holds, working as a makeshift piton. Karen reaches for another broken femur, lodging it a foot above the first. She hauls her body up now, suspending her weight from the two makeshift pitons. Again, they hold. Trembling from exertion, Karen pulls the right piton free, hanging solely from her left hand now. Though her handhold is precarious, she manages to swing the right hand up again, pounding that piton another foot above the left. In this slow, torturous manner, Karen begins to climb her way up out of the pit.</context>
