   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Parrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades, the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided. He rises now, crosses to the bathroom. As he pees, a breeze outside the window, the wind again, but then the Voice comes up:</context>
      <utterance>... Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>It is unmistakably a Voice, it is not the wind, Parrish has heard something, he looks around, but no one is there. He can't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom. All beweild- ered, Parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed, trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't heard; he is not sure. He pulls the covers up now, not a SOUND, tries to close his eyes.</context>
      <utterance>Yes...</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Parrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one there, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up, should he not, what is happening? He looks out: absolute stillness and silence, CRICKETS chirp down by the river, a light FLICKERS from a shadboat, Parrish closes his eyes but then they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and finally, exhausted, falls back asleep.</context>
      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? I say fall head over heels. Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. And how do you find him? Forget your head and listen to your heart. I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back. Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try. Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.</utterance>

      <context>Frozen with surprise, Parrish's eyes search the room for the source of the SOUND, it comes from no particular direction, yet surrounds him. Suddenly Parrish's symptoms sharply intensify, he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a corner of the desk, holds on with one hand, with the other clutches at his shoulder and arm, the pain has violently seized the upper part of his body. He breaks out in a sweat, his pallor now waxen as the Voice repeats itself: VOICE (V.O., cont'd) ...Yes. Parrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him on the one hand, the Voice coming at him from the outer, each aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself, consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a hallucination but which he is certain is not. Parrish is possessed. He angles his face in every direction, arbi- trarily chooses one and now embarrassedly, unconsciously, enrage, responds to the Voice.</context>

      <utterance>What are your intentions? To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.

      <context>He shifts the spoon from hand to hand, starts to stick it in his pocket, realizes this is inappropriate.

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Joe redirects himself, goes to the door. As they both are about to exit, Joe and Susan sneak furtive looks at each other across the pool, smile at catching each other's glances. Joe exits. For a moment Susan's eyes remain on the door through which he has gone. Now she grips the towel over her shoulders, the one Joe gave her, pats the same spot he did.</context>

   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Parrish regards Joe, the tie is a sorry mess now, a batwing of silk stretching across his collarbone. JOE (cont'd) But I did so enjoy your family. Parrish is startled, he regards Joe carefully.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill. You'll ruin the good start we had last night. I felt as if I were being treated like a person. 'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Silence as Joe considers the point, Parrish quickly crosses to him, undoes the tie, and now begins tying it for him. PARRISH (cont'd) Tell you what, you promised that it's going to be only me and --</context>

Joe, catching sight of his own appearance, rises to the balls of his feet, quite taken. JOE (cont'd) This is great! (a moment) Now what do we do?</context>
      <utterance>You've got a deal.</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today. And I'm expecting you won't mention it again. I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones. But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him. What are you, his shadow? Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak? You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P. That means without you. Okay, pal? Let's eat.</utterance>

   <speaker>DREW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Board falls silent. Sloane, a peer of Parrish's, fidgets. Drew milks the moment. DREW (cont'D) It's no surprise if I suggest to you that the Bill Parrish we know is not the Bill Parrish you saw yesterday. You heard that speech -- some strange emotional rationale to buttress a knee-jerk rejection of a legitimate offer. Does it not strike you that something is possibly affecting this man's judgement? More specifically -- his judgement to make a critical business decision? Silence, the Board clocking Drew's argument. DREW (cont'D) It's not pleasant to say the follow- ing, but I would be remiss, in this crisis, if I did not. When we pre- sent Bill with the improved Bontecou offer, and if he refuses to let us consider it -- once more makes an adamant or emotional rejection -- we will have no choice but to seek an alternative.</context>
      <utterance>...I know you're all as uncomfor- table as I am to be meeting without Bill, but I got a call last night from John Bontecou. Not only is he still interested, he is sweetening his offer.  Although it pains me to say it, in my opinion Bill Parrish dealt with us peremptorily in dismissing any deal with Bontecou. Therefore, I'm sorry to say that if we are to exam- ine this new offer responsibly as the Board of Directors of Parrish Communications, we must do so with- out its Chairman.  Oh yes, there is one additional element: Bontecou is so anxious to get us, he said he'd take Parrish Communications with our Chairman or without.</utterance>

      <context>Drew leans over to Felicia, speaks quietly and she leaves the room. DREW (cont'd) How did this all come about? Crisis -- Bill Parrish, crisis -- his com- pany, crisis for us. I came about with the arrival on the scene of -- Mr. Joe Black. Mr. Joe who? Joe Black. He attends our Board meet- int, he sleeps at Bill's house, re- sides in his office. Never leaves his side. And, in my opinion, is always in his ear. Telling him what to do and Bill is listening. Who is Joe Black? What is his relationship to Bill Parrish? And most important, what is behind his influence on our Chairman?</context>

      <utterance>I hope you'll respect its nature -- What we're trying to do here is gather our thoughts -- in light of Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer -- and make an appropriate presenta- tion to him as to how we think the company might proceed. Won't you share with our Board the information you gave me last night? Quince hesitates, then realizes what Drew has on his mind.

      <utterance>That's it. It's over. Get out.</utterance>
   <speaker>DREW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Joe considers him evenly.</context>
      <utterance>So I guess a blowjob's out of the question? Joe clears his throat. DREW  Did you say something?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Almost.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Now Drew wheels, heads right for the front door and exits with a SLAM.</context>
      <utterance>I said get out.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A moment passes before Susan realizes she and Joe are alone, and Joe does as well.</context>
      <utterance>What an angry fellow.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>

      <utterance>Please. We don't need to talk about Drew.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They drift, osmotically, into the library in awkward silence. SUSAN (cont'd) Brave you had a chance to look at Dad's rare books? Jefferson's Parliamentary Manual, a first edition Bleak House -- Joe comes closer, takes a deep breath.</context>
      <utterance>No. We don't.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I love your smell.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Now Susan, close to Joe, leans closer, her nose in Joe's neck. Joe holds himself very still. SUSAN (cont'd) I like your smell, too.</context>
      <utterance>-- I guess you haven't.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It was everything. Silence, the TICKING of the clock. SUSAN  When I was little, my mother used to say, "Darling, you could set your heart by this clock".</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>-- Could you?</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A moment.</context>
      <utterance>Why, yes. Thank you.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Susan reaches out for Joe, they kiss, he is awkward but his very awkwardness endearing. Susan pulls him closer, they linger now, mouths on each other's, then separate. SUSAN (cont'd) Thank you.</context>
      <utterance>You're welcome.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The clock TICKS on. A sense of foreboding falls over Joe's face, his fear that he is passing through some barrier, a point of no return.</context>
      <utterance>You're welcome.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The apprehensive expression on Joe's face fades away.</context>
      <utterance>Joe?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes?</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well...I'm -- uh, Joe. And you're Susan. And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And is your heart beating strangely?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Their faces inches from each other's.</context>
      <utterance>Faster. And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever. An intake of breath. She is about to speak. JOE  And you don't even have to say a word.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Her question makes Joe, almost involuntarily, smile. Susan takes the opportunity to step back from him. The SOUND of someone at the door, it is Parrish, Susan turns, comprehends immediately how the situation will appear to him.</context>
      <utterance>I have to go home. But neither Susan nor Joe moves. SUSAN  Don't I?</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She drifts right past him, exits. Joe and Parrish are left alone now, eyes on each other's.</context>

      <context>An odd mixture of responses, the Board sheepish and at the same time looking their most dutiful at this odd meeting, its sudden convening clearly a problem for Parrish, a prob- lem which he does not attempt to hide, only control.</context>
      <utterance>Good morning.</utterance>
   <speaker>DREW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Drew gets the message, at the same time Joe is checking out all the attendees, his eyes come to rest on Drew.</context>
      <utterance>I don't think so. Do you?</utterance>
   <speaker>DREW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>To get to the point, we have re- ceived new information from John Bontecou concerning his desires for this company to merge with his, and we wanted to set the details before you. A moment as Parrish looks around, the moment extends, it appears he may not ever answer.</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's it?</utterance>
   <speaker>DREW</speaker>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The answer is no, quick enough for you?</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't you want to hear the details?</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either. What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal. No, thank you.</utterance>
   <speaker>DREW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?</utterance>

      <utterance>Certainly, Bill.</utterance>

      <utterance>We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --</utterance>
   <speaker>DREW</speaker>

   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A BUZZ amongst the Board, they finally rustle into silence under Parrish's withering glance. PARRISH (cont'd) That's it? I've got a busy day and this meeting has already set me behind. Shall we adjourn?</context>
      <utterance>Doesn't need to. Today, tomorrow, a week from now -- 'a week from now', who can think about a week from now -- the answer is going to be the same -- a loud, unmistakable, all-inclusive, airtight -- 'No'.</utterance>
   <speaker>DREW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Everybody's eyes are on Joe.</context>
      <utterance>Before we do, while we're here, there is a second question the Board would like a response to, a far simpler one. Parrish waits. DREW  Who is the man sitting to the right of you?</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.</utterance>
   <speaker>DREW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Quince flinches at these words, his hands clasped in front of him, his knuckles white as Parrish regards Drew, but still does not answer. DREW (cont'd) The lack of response, Bill, is not appropriate. We are your Board, we have a right to know how you are managing the operations of this company, and most importantly, that you have not delegated someone to do it for you. Parrish squirms, desperately uncomfortable but still does not speak. DREW (cont'd) Okay, one more time. Drew regards Joe. DREW (cont'd) Who is Joe Black? Parrish stares stoically into the middle distance as Quince's head sinks into his hands. DREW (cont'd) (to the Board) A motion has been brought before the Board to invoke Article 19 of the corporate charter.</context>
      <utterance>But who is he? What are his creden- tials? What is his relationship to you? No response from Parrish. DREW  The feeling of the Board is this: we fear Mr. Black is not only influenc- ing your decisions in regard to this company, but that you are relying on him to make them for you.</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>In English, please.</utterance>
   <speaker>DREW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A "Yes" is heard, now another "Yes", now more "Yes"es, all reluctant, "No" from Sloane, "No" from Quince who realizes he is the instrument of Parrish's dismissal. DREW (cont'd) The motion is passed. We will of course delay the announcement, out of respect for our former Chairman, until after the celebration of his birthday this weekend.</context>
      <utterance>Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday. Parrish is expressionless. DREW  At which time, the Chairman will be named Emeritus, he will be welcome to attend all meetings, and will serve as International Spokesman for the corporation plus, of course, a settlement, a golden parachute of such magnitude that his feet will never touch the ground. Drew pauses. DREW  Please indicate your vote by a "Yes" or "No".</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Joe's eyes are riveted on Drew.</context>
      <utterance>Thank you for allowing me to save face, Drew.</utterance>
   <speaker>DREW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The other motion before us is the acceptance of John Bontecou's offer to merge this corporation with Bontecou International -- Parrish stands, Drew stops speaking.</utterance>

   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She gets up, closes the door, sits back down again next to Joe. A warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each other, now they fall into a foreplay which Susan recognizes as such, Joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily but has no knowledge where it is leading. His movements are instinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin- gers, odd things about her seem to interest him. This excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the very sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each other are intuitive and spontaneous; even though Joe has no know- ledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his actions are such that they never beg the question -- has he done it before. Strange territory for Joe, not to be 'in control' and exert- ing his power, but his inventions and responses in lovemak- ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and Susan builds. Joe has found himself in an unexplored land of feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and yet at the same time, is terrified by it. He feels himself being lured by some power he has not only never been aware of, but is deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is doing is putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on. The powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan, and in the end there is the knowledge they have together made a journey, they both have been swept away in a stream of events they have created; and they don't care about the consequences. Spent, they lie in silence. Finally Susan speaks:</context>
      <utterance>Maybe it's the draft through the door.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Joe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she has said, but to tell her more, even the truth about himself. He weighs, then resists, the impulse.</context>
      <utterance>It's so wonderful to make love to you. It's like making love to some- one who has never made love before.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Her head nestles underneath his arm, she has a sense of his comforting her without knowing that he is doing so.</context>

      <utterance>-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room. I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But before she can answer, a workman is tugging at Allison's sleeve, she turns away from Parrish to give him instructions out of Parrish's earshot, and then turns back, they step away now, daughter and father, alone.</context>

   <speaker>ALLISON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I do it because I love you. Because everybody I loved you. Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah? And what about my enemies?</utterance>
   <speaker>ALLISON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Unexpectedly, Allison brushes a lock away from Parrish's forehead, with a flick she has rearranged his hair, he blinks, a little embarrassed, but having liked it. ALLISON (cont'd) Above all, you've been a wonderful father.</context>
      <utterance>They respect you. Isn't that a kind of love?</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>

      <utterance>But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay. Because I know you love me. Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>

      <utterance>What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you. Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place. He was setting up Bill from day one. Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside. And I was the fool who made it all happen. Oh God, what do I do?</utterance>

      <utterance>I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.</utterance>

      <utterance>Why did you come in here and tell me, Joe? You are the Biggest Shot of all, you don't have to ask my permission, but that's what you're doing. You know why? Because you've somewhere, somehow, developed into a good guy, and you know this is all wrong... I don't know what you're going to do -- how can this be love? She doesn't know who you are. Why don't you tell her? Try it out on her? See what happens. Reveal everything there is to know about yourself and let the chips fall where they may. Joe has received what Parrish has said. PARRISH  Okay? -- I've given it my best shot. I wish I could tell you to sleep on it but...</utterance>

      <utterance>You're the poison, Drew. You've operated behind-the-scenes to suborn the trust of a man who has stamped you with his imprimatur of class and elegance and stature. I've seen all kinds and degrees of deception in my time, but Bill Parrish has been on the receiving end of machinations so Machiavellian that it has rarely been my experience to encounter. And yet he has combatted them stoically, and selflessly, without revealing my identity. Had he violated the vow of secrecy he took, his task would have been far easier, he could have turned defeat into victory, but he is too honorable a man to have done that. And now I must release him from that vow. Because of me, he has lost his work, his company, his reputation -- and now he's going to tell you who I am.</utterance>

      <utterance>That's why it's okay. They drift into silence. PARRISH  No regrets?</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A long silence, Susan smiles.</context>
      <utterance>'No regrets'.</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Silence again.</context>
      <utterance>It's a good feeling, isn't it?</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an understanding.</context>
      <utterance>Everybody's saying goodbye...</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He starts to lead her to the floor, immediately stops.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, yes --</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, Dad, you're not old. You'll never be old. He takes her in his arms and they dance away.</utterance>

   <speaker>WAITER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Joe regards the Waiter for a moment.</context>
      <utterance>Can I get you anything, sir?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Waiter hesitates.</context>
      <utterance>Do you have any peanut butter?</utterance>
   <speaker>WAITER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't think so, sir.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Waiter moves off. Joe's attention returns to Parrish and Susan, the dance number ends, a BOOM.</context>
      <utterance>Thank you, anyway.</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What was that?</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Parrish looks up, sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting. SUSAN (cont'd) (to Parrish) Shall we?</context>
      <utterance>The fireworks are about to start.</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly he hugs her, holds her very close. She looks at him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she smiles back. Now she heads out with the crowd for the fireworks. When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns and heads up towards Joe. Joe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches.</context>
      <utterance>You go ahead, honey, I'm going to catch my breath.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Happy Birthday, Bill.</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks. Joe's gaze lingers. PARRISH (cont'd) Did you say goodbye?</context>
      <utterance>Thank you.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not exactly.</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I guess you have your reasons.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Silence.</context>
      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now that we have a moment, would you mind if I expressed my gratitude for what you did for Susan? Joe waits. PARRISH  I never heard her speak of any man as she spoke of you -- It was always what I wanted for her -- but what happens to her now?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Joe regards Parrish, waits until he has a sense that Parrish has accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues: JOE (cont'd) And would you mind if I expressed my gratitude...? Parrish waits. JOE (cont'd) For you. For the time you've given me. For the person you are. A moment.</context>
      <utterance>I wouldn't worry about it, Bill. These things have a way of working out.</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Joe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the crowd below, searching. PARRISH (cont'd) It's hard to let go, isn't it?</context>
      <utterance>Don't blow smoke up my ass, you'll ruin my autopsy.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A silence, an understanding there is another more to say. Joe looks inquiringly at Parrish as if to say "Shall we?", Parrish nods and Joe turns with him. They set off now away from the party, up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking the river.</context>
      <utterance>That's life. What can I tell you?</utterance>
</dialogue>

<dialogue id="66" n_utterances="2">
   <speaker>PARRISH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But Parrish doesn't wait for a response, just continues on up the meadow, towards the rise of the hill, Joe in step with him. PARRISH (cont'd) Should I be afraid? Joe stops, Parrish stops with him.</context>
      <utterance>I'm getting a little dizzy, I can feel my heart pumping --</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Parrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides out again, Joe right with him. In tandem they continue on and disappear over the crest of the hill. A barrage of fireworks lights up the sky.</context>
      <utterance>Not a man like you.</utterance>
</dialogue>

<dialogue id="67" n_utterances="23">
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right in front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so appealing. They are riveted on each other, uneasy and yet close. SUSAN (cont'd) You're here... He is trying to get his bearings.</context>
      <utterance>Joe...?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Something about him makes Susan slightly tentative.</context>
      <utterance>-- You bet.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Joe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of time and place.</context>
      <utterance>Where did you go?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Some realization is dawning on Susan, it renders her lightheaded. JOE (cont'd) ...But now I'm back. Susan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an answer.</context>
      <utterance>I don't know -- y'know, I don't know -- it's all blurred up and hazy. And would y'know what I mean if I said I don't think it's worth figuring out?</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's it?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>It's a helluva party --</context>
      <utterance>Well, I don't know what else to say.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You think so?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Susan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his jacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling with the last moments fades away. Susan slowly realizes this is the Young Man. She is shaken, a sudden intake of breath.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.</utterance>
   <speaker>YOUNG MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His hand politely touches her elbow, courteously lending her support.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, you all right?</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Young Man nods, pleased with her recognition.</context>
      <utterance>The coffee shop --</utterance>
   <speaker>YOUNG MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I asked you if I said something wrong and you said it was so right it scared you. Susan holds herself very still. YOUNG MAN  And forgive me for saying this -- but then you said -- and it's been with me ever since --</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He hesitates.</context>
      <utterance>What has --?</utterance>
   <speaker>YOUNG MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You said you liked me.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No --</utterance>
   <speaker>YOUNG MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A moment.</context>
      <utterance>Y'didn't?</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She falls silent now, overcome by the last moments' revelations. The Young Man senses her discomfort which is on the edge of pain.</context>
      <utterance>I said I liked you so much.</utterance>
   <speaker>YOUNG MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, everything's going great -- don't y'think? She doesn't answer for a moment. YOUNG MAN  Don't you feel that way?</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...We know so little about each other.</utterance>
   <speaker>YOUNG MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She searches the Young Man's eyes, his face is open, completely vulnerable, waiting for her response. A long silence, the words come out haltingly:</context>
      <utterance>But we've got time.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Another moment.</context>
      <utterance>I wish you could've known my father...</utterance>
   <speaker>YOUNG MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Susan signs, the Young Man smiles gently, they are completely intent on each other.</context>
      <utterance>Me, too.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A long silence.</context>
      <utterance>...What do we do now?</utterance>
   <speaker>YOUNG MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Susan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC comes up from below, the night fills with light. The Young Man searches Susan's face, now takes her hand -- and together they start back towards the party.</context>
      <utterance>It will come to us.</utterance>
