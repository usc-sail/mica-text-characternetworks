      <utterance>Hey, whadaya say? Curt? Last night in town, you guys gonna have a little bash before you leave?</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Steve reaches into his pocket and hands Curt an envelope without saying anything. Curt opens it slowly and pulls out a check.</context>
      <utterance>The Moose have been lookin' for you all day, man.</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Curt hands the envelope back to Steve.</context>
      <utterance>Mr. Jenning couldn't find you, so he gave it to me to give to you. He said he's sorry it's so late, but it's the first scholarship the Moose Lodge has given out. Oh yeah, he says they're all very proud of you.</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well... ah... why don't you hold onto it for a while?</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's with you? It's yours! Take it! I don't want it.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll take it.</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly a horn honks and they all turn. Laurie Henderson pulls into the drive-in and waves to them. She is driving the family's '58 Edsel.</context>
      <utterance>Steve... Ah, I think we'd better have a talk. I've gotten-</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Your sister calls. I'll talk to you later.</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now, Steve! Let her wait.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Okay, make it short and sweet.</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, well... Listen...  I... I don't think I'm going tomorrow.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What! Come on, what are you talking about?</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Laurie honks the horn a couple of times. Steve ignores her. There is a long moment and Curt looks uncomfortable.</context>
      <utterance>I don't know. I was thinking I might wait for a year... go to city--</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You chicken fink.</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Wait, let me explain--</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly, there's an ear-splitting roar and they all turn as a yellow '32 Ford deuce coupe--chopped, lowered and sporting a Hemi-V8--bumps into the lot. The low slung classic rumbles and parks at the rear of the drive in. Big John Milner, twenty-two, sits in his Ford, tough and indifferent, puffing on a Camel. He wears a white T-shirt and a butch haircut molded on the sides into a ducktail. A cowboy in a deuce coupe--simple, sentimental and cocksure of himself.</context>
      <utterance>You can't back out now! After all we went through to get accepted. We're finally getting out of this turkey town and now you want to crawl back into your cell--look, I gotta talk to Laurie.  Now take it. We're leaving in the morning. Okay?</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You wanna end up like John? You can't stay seventeen forever.</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I just want some time to think. What's the rush? I'll go next year.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Steve walks off toward Laurie's Edsel. Laurie gets out. She's wearing a letterman's sweater with a large "Class of '62" emblazoned on the shoulder. Steve goes to her and they hug. On the radio, the music ends, and the Wolfman's intro tune comes on.</context>
      <utterance>We'll talk later.</utterance>
   <speaker>RADIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>"Here comes the Wolfman--Wolfman Jack!"</utterance>

      <utterance>Oh, We're gonna rock and roll ourselves to death baby. You got the Wolfman Jack Show!</utterance>

   <speaker>GIRL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The girls in the car all screech and giggle as they zoom off.</context>
      <utterance>Hi John!</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not too good, huh?</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>John watches the procession of gleaming cars traveling through the hot night.</context>
      <utterance>Why is it every girl that comes around here is ugly? Or has a boyfriend? Where is the dazzling beauty I've been searching for all my life?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly, in the distance, there's a blood-curdling scream from an incredible high-performance engine. The entire drive- in stops and listens.</context>
      <utterance>I know what you mean. The pickin's are really gettin' slim. The whole strip is shrinking. Ah, you know, I remember about five years ago, take you a couple of hours and a tank full of gas just to make one circuit. It was really somethin.'</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, John. Someone new in town.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ahhh.</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You gonna go after him?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, listen, Professor, if he can't find me, then he ain't worth racin', right?</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Across the swarming parking lot, Steve sits in the front seat of his chevy with Laurie. Budda Macrae, a car hop, leans down to attach a tray to Steve's window, showing off her tight blouse.</context>
      <utterance>The big shot!</utterance>
   <speaker>BUDDA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She tucks in her blouse a little tighter, gives him a hot look and goes to get the other tray. Budda takes the other tray around the car, almost shoves it in the window where Laurie is sitting.</context>
      <utterance>A cherry-vanilla coke and a chocolate mountain. Anything else you want, Steve?  If there is you let me know now. Just honk and I'm yours.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUDDA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She gives Laurie an antagonistic look and goes off. Steve laughs. Laurie smiles. She's seventeen, very pretty, with big doe-eyes, and a short bobbed hairdo. She pushes up the sleeves on Steve's letterman sweater, which is sizes too large for her. His class ring glints on a chain around her neck. Laurie is sweet, the image of vulnerability, but with a practical and self-preserving mind beneath.</context>
      <utterance>One fries--grab it before I drop it.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Where was I?</utterance>
   <speaker>LAURIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Um, how you thought high school romances were goofy and we started going together just because you thought I was kinda cute and funny, but then you suddenly realized you were in love with me, it was serious... and ah... oh, you were leadin' up to somethin' kinda big.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Through the windshield of the Chevy, they see Terry run by in front of them, chasing Budda Macrae who's outdistancing him on her roller skates.</context>
      <utterance>You make it sound like I'm giving dictation. Well, seriously, what I meant was, that ah... since we do care for each other so much, and since we should really consider ourselves as adults. Now, I, ah... could I have a couple of those fries?</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ah, where was I?</utterance>
   <speaker>LAURIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Laurie pretends to be interested in her french fries, but is obviously expecting something big.</context>
      <utterance>..."consider ourselves adults"...</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Laurie hasn't looked up but her mood has changed like a mask.</context>
      <utterance>Right... right... anyway, I thought maybe, before I leave, we could ah... agree that... that seeing other people while I'm away can't possibly hurt, you know?</utterance>
   <speaker>LAURIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You mean dating other people?</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Steve smiles and then looks to her. He stops smiling. They listen to the radio for an awkward moment. Laurie struggles to hold back her tears. With obvious difficulty, she turns to him and smiles. He's expected something different and doesn't know what to do, so he smiles back.</context>
      <utterance>I think it would strengthen our relationship. Then we'd know for sure that we're really in love. Not that there's any doubt.</utterance>
   <speaker>LAURIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Laurie takes his ring on the chain from around her neck and puts it in her purse.</context>
      <utterance>I think you're right. I mean, we're not kids anymore, and it's silly to think that when we're three thousand miles apart we shouldn't be able to see other people and go out.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Laurie, now, listen, I didn't ask for that back. I think that...</utterance>
   <speaker>LAURIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know. I just sort of think it's juvenile now. I'll keep it at home. It's less conspicuous there.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You don't want to wear it?</utterance>
   <speaker>LAURIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Steve just looks at her and nods. The Wolfman howls an intro to "Gee" by the Crows. Outside, skooting around the drive-in after Budda, Terry is pleading with the sexy car hop as she delivers a tray to a car.</context>
      <utterance>I didn't say that. I understand and I'm not upset. I mean, I can't expect you to be a monk or something while you're away.</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...and I have a really sharp record collection. I even have "Pledging My Love" by Johnny Ace. Anyway, how can you love Nelson when he's going out with Marilyn Gator. Since he dumped on you maybe we could--</utterance>
   <speaker>BUDDA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Her tone changes immediately. Terry looks sour and turns around to Steve who's getting out of the chevy. Budda leaves, wiggling her butt for Steve.</context>
      <utterance>He didn't dump on me, you little dip. Hi, Steve!</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She's a little conceited--just playing hard to get.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Listen, I came over here to talk to you about--</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Any time, buddy. I'm your man. Nothing I like better than chewing the rug with a pal. You talk, I'll listen. I'm all ears. Shoot.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Shut up.</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sure.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Steve notices Terry isn't with him any more and turns. Terry is standing frozen to a spot.</context>
      <utterance>Terry, I'm going to let you take care of my car while we're away--at least until Christmas. I'm afraid if I leave it with my--</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Terry tries to talk, much like a shell-shocked war veteran. His mouth moves but only a gurgle comes out. Curt is standing by the Chevy, talking with his sister Laurie. She's still upset by what Steve said to her.</context>
      <utterance>What's wrong?</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, sis--what's wrong?</utterance>
   <speaker>LAURIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Meanwhile, they watch Terry as Steve explains to him about the car.</context>
      <utterance>Nothing.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The others are watching now as Terry shakes his head mechanically.</context>
      <utterance>Now listen, only 30 weight Castrol- R. I've written the tire pressure and stuff on a pad in the glove compartment. Are you listening?</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There is indeed a tear rolling down Terry's cheek.</context>
      <utterance>What's wrong, he's crying!</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Laurie watches Terry, realizing that like the car, she'll be left behind as a fond memory. She turns and looks at Steve, who's been watching her. There's a moment between them... Budda comes by with an empty tray. Terry sees her and wipes his eyes. He walks up to her, a strange look on his face.</context>
      <utterance>I can't... believe... it.  I don't know what to say. I'll... love and protect this car until death do us part.  This is a superfine machine. This may even be better than Daryl Starbird's superfleck moonbird. It is better than Daryl Starbird's.</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The idea is so preposterous that even Budda is speechless. She looks around at others.</context>
      <utterance>Budda, how would you like to go to the drive-in movies with me?</utterance>
   <speaker>BUDDA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You've got to be kidding!</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>John walks up quietly and casually pulls down hard on the back pockets of Terry's low riding levis. There is general hysteria as Terry quickly pulls up his pants.</context>
      <utterance>Would I kid you about a thing like that? I want you to know that something has happened to me tonight that is going to change everything. I've got a new...</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Car!! All right, who's the wise--  Oh, John--verrry funny.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, did she do that to you?</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Let's get going. It seems like we've spent most of our lives in this parking lot.</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, Curt, let's bomb around, I wanna try out my new wheels!</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'd like to, Toad, but I'm going with Steve and Laurie to the hop. I'd just slow you down anyway.</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, tonight things are going to be different.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>John walks angrily to his coupe, gets in and slams the door. Curt looks at the others and shrugs.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah, yeah... Well, listen. You go. Go ahead, Curtsy, baby. You go on over there and you remember all the good times you won't be having. I ain't goin' off to some goddamned fancy college. I'm stayin' right here. Havin' fun, as usual.</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Curt goes over and stands by the window of the yellow coupe.</context>

      <context>Terry revs his engine. So does the Ford. The tension mounts. The green arrow for the left turn lane flashes on, the car on Terry's other side moves off, and before he can control his reflexes, Terry, too, has shot into the intersection while the light remains red! Terry quickly shifts and returns to the starting position. The other driver is grinning. Terry is flustered and embarrassed. Terry revs the Chevy a couple more times, concentration intently this time on the right light. Green!... The Ford bolts into the intersection. Terry likewise floors the gas pedal and goes crashing backwards into a large Buick. Terry is stunned for a moment, then realizes he forgot to shift into first. He fumbles to get the car into first gear. A distinguished looking man comes up to his window after inspecting the damage. Terry tries to escape, but in his panic the engine dies.

      <utterance>All right. Hey, I thought you'd left.</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mr. Wolfe takes out a pack of matches and lights both their cigarettes. They walk down a chain-link fence, past dark, venetian-blinded classrooms.</context>
      <utterance>No, not yet.  I have no matches.</utterance>

      <utterance>Brother, how do I get stuck with dance supervision? Will you tell me that?... You going back East? Boy, I remember the day I went off. Got drunk as hell the night before. Just--</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Blotto. Exactly. Barfed on the train all the next day.</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Cute. Very cute. Where'd you go again?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WOLFE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Middlebury. Vermont. Got a scholarship.</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And only stayed a semester.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WOLFE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>One semester. And after all that, I came back here.</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WOLFE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Decided I wasn't the competitive type. I don't know... maybe I was scared.</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, you know I might find I'm not the competitive type myself.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WOLFE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What do you mean?</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I'm not really sure that I'm going.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WOLFE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Then a voice calls from the shadows.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, now--don't be stupid. Go. Experience life. Have some fun, Curtis.</utterance>
   <speaker>JANE</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>They turn and see a girl coming out of a doorway. Mr. Wolfe looks at Jane, one of his students, but doesn't say anything.</context>
      <utterance>Bill?</utterance>
   <speaker>JANE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I mean--Mr. Wolfe. Can I speak with you a minute.  Hi, Curt.</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He looks at Mr. Wolfe, who seems a little embarrassed. Then, Mr. Wolfe sticks out his hand.</context>
      <utterance>Jane...</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WOLFE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Curt shakes his hand.</context>
      <utterance>Anyway--good luck, Curtis.</utterance>
   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Curt walks back toward the gym. Looking around, he sees Mr. Wolfe standing in the shadows with the girl, talking intimately. Curt turns away and goes off. Before going back into the gym, Curt stops. He sees a white T-bird parked among a row of cars in the parking lot. He walks--then starts running toward the car. There's a blonde sitting in the front seat making out with some guy. Curt leans down to the window and is about to say something to his dream girl. But she turns and he sees it's not her. Her boyfriend glares at him like he's some kind of peeping Tom. Curt backs away awkwardly, trying to smile. He leaves.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah... I'll see you. Thanks a lot.</utterance>

      <context>Holstein drops the ticket through the window onto John's lap. He starts back to his patrol car. When he's out of earshot John answers.</context>

   <speaker>GIRLFRIEND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Terry doesn't say anything. There's another incredible scream as Falfa roars off, leaving Terry to stare through his smoke. Terry accelerates the '58 Chevy--at a prudent speed. As the radio blares "Almost Grown," Terry glides past the lighted stores slowly, taking in everything with wide eyes from his beautiful new car. Terry passes a steaming rear-end collision at an intersection where two guys and two girls are all yelling. Then, suddenly, he spots a girl--walking--alone. His mouth drops open in amazement as he slows to a crawl. Debbie, nineteen, with blonde hair, wearing a blue and white spaghetti- strap dress, strolls along the sidewalk. Terry rolls the powerful engine, but she ignores him. As he passes her, he speeds up.</context>
      <utterance>Ain't he neat?</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Terry tears around the corner and starts his approach once more. He quickly whips out his comb, touches up his hair and settles down into a comfortable slouch.</context>
      <utterance>What a babe... what a bitchin' babe... And Wolfman Baby, she's all mine.</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He hits the clutch, roars the engine a couple more times and then--disaster. Debbie passes behind some rough looking dudes on motorcycles, parked along the curb. One especially vicious biker turns and looks at Terry as he passes. Terry roars off around the block.</context>
      <utterance>Okay, honey, here I come--James Dean lives!</utterance>
   <speaker>TERRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As Debbie passes the bikers, they hoot, holler, and make barnyard noises. From the cat calls, and Debbie's manner it seems obvious that Debbie is a girl a lot of boys have "known." She has walked clear of the bikers as Terry screeches around the corner again. He pulls up alongside her and again slows to a crawl. The pass each other for awhile, but she doesn't look over.</context>
      <utterance>Stay cool, honey--don't let those creeps bug you. Wolfman, please don't let those creeps bug her... please.</utterance>

He slammed bam into the Ford and then they both of them crashed into a row of cars and all those kids watchin! Jesus, eight kids killed including both drivers, looked like a battlefield.

      <context>Ants (a tall, ghoulish-looking kid who probably got his name from the scar across his face which has recently been stitched to look like a party of ants marching across his cheek) brings Curt back gently. Joe is bent over looking across the hood of the De Soto.</context>

   <speaker>JOE</speaker>

      <context>Joe gives him another charming punch on the shoulder. The others have left the tv's and are watching Curt now, looking puzzled and pained at the scratch on the car.</context>
      <utterance>You scratched it, man. Where do you get off sitting on Gil's car, huh, man?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Joe leads Curt gently but forcibly toward an incredible maroon '51 Merc that's been lowered and chopped so that the windows are like ominous slits and the whole machine has a submarine quality. Joe opens the door and Curt slides into the white fluffy interior. In the small back window, a metal plaque reads "PHAROAHS." The third member of the gang is Carlos, a short little kid about fifteen years old. He appears tougher than the rest with a cigarette dangling from his mouth. Joe heads for the driver's side and Ants and Carlos both go for the front passenger door.</context>

      <context>He leads Curt toward the screen door. Curt looks around at the Pharoahs, who are slowly starting to work again pilfering the machines. Inside the small office, Curt shakes hands with Hank Anderson, who pats him on the shoulder.</context>
      <utterance>Tomorrow. Well, listen, Hank Anderson's inside. Come in and say goodbye. You know, Hank's the one that brought your name up on the floor of the Moose Hall. You got the check, didn't you?</utterance>
   <speaker>HANK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>We are all proud of you, Curt. The Moose Scholarship couldn't have gone to a better boy. And if there's anything we can do, let us know.</utterance>

      <context>Curt hasn't the slightest idea what Joe is talking about. Joe puts his arm around Curt's shoulders and leads him away, explaining what he has to do, while Ants and Carlos grin. In the middle of the used car lot, a patrol car hides among the autos for sale. Inside the car, Holstein sits with another officer who's dozing. Across Holstein's dark glasses, reflections of the kids' cars cruising by can be seen, as Holstein waits to nab somebody. Joe approaches the patrol car through the lot. He ducks, carrying a length of metal cable in his hand. Curt wanders behind him. Joe sees him and motions for him to get down.</context>

      <context>The policeman waits for a victim. In the background, we see Curt dodging from behind one car to another. Taking cover, Curt makes another break toward a car--and trips and falls. In the cop car, Holstein thinks he hears something. He opens the door and gets out. Adjusting his billy club, he paces around the used car lot officiously, while Curt hides behind a Falcon and peeks out from behind a fender. He sees Holstein walking back toward the squad car. The cop opens the door again and climbs in. The echoing sound of the calls coming over the police radio blend with the Wolfman's howling as cars pass with their radios blaring. Curt is inching forward with the cable, toward the squad car. In the background, a slow freight train can be heard starting to move across the valley. Curt ties the cable to a post and then, looking scared, crawls under the police car with the cable. Underneath the car, Curt inches on his back and then reaches up and attaches the cable to the rear axle of the car.</context>

THe red lights start flashing and the siren wails. The patrol car shifts into gear and leaps forward. Suddenly, there's a horrendous metallic screech, the patrol car hurtles up and out, airborne for a moment--then noses down and bounces along the pavement, sending out sparks as it slides to a stop. The driver is stunned and frozen to the wheel. Holstein manages to remove his dark glasses and looks back. There, sitting quietly in the middle of the parking lot, is their trans-axle and two rear wheels. The patrol car sits on the ground at a twenty degree angle, while its engine whines impotently at top speed. On the radio, the all-seeing Wolfman gives an evil laugh--</context>

      <context>As the Wolfman talks on, Curt glances toward the street. He sees the white Thunderbird gliding by. He sits up quickly and tries to start the Citroen--but the machine barely turns over. He keeps trying desperately, but the engine won't catch.</context>

As it does the manager punches some buttons and the record segues into a Wolfman howl and then the distinctive Wolfman voice takes over. The manager adjusts the monitor volume down and sucks his popsicle.</context>

      <utterance>Listen, it's early in the morning. Now, I can't really talk for the Wolfman. But I think if he was here he'd tell you to get your ass in gear. Now, no offense to your home town here, but this place ain't exactly the hub of the universe, if you know what I mean. And well--I'll tell you this much--the Wolfman does come in here now and then, with tapes, to check up on me, you know, and when I hear the stories he got about the places he goes. Hell, here I sit while there's a big beautiful world out there, don't ya know. Wolfman comes in last time talking about some exotic jungle country, handing me cigars he says was rolled on the naked thighs of brown beauties. The Wolfman been everywhere and he seen everything. He got so many stories, so many memories. And here I sit sucking on popsicles.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, I'm no kid anymore. I been here a long time. And the Wolfman-- well, the Wolfman gave me my start and he's sorta become my life. I can't leave him now. Gotta be loyal to the Wolfman, you understand.</utterance>

      <context>Curt goes out the door. He starts back out through the maze of windows and electronic machines. Echoing throughout the rooms, the Wolfman's raucous voice follows Curt. The Wolfman howls and Curt turns. Through the maze of glass, shifting like prisms, he sees the station manager sitting by the mike--howling! Then, he laughs and howls again, starting to sing a song called "Bluebirds on My Dingaling," pounding out the rhythm on the console.</context>

      <mode></mode>

      <context>John settles back in the driver's seat and positions his hand on the gear-shift, which we see is wrapped with rags because of the missing knob. Both drivers start revvin' their engines; the tension builds. Terry looks nervous, the engines start to scream and Terry, his hands shaking on the flashlight, manages to flash it on. Both cars roar off the starting line, tires smoking and screaming. Terry has his hands over his head and is coughing in a cloud of smoke as they pass. John beats Falfa off the line. Out on the road, as they hit third gear, the cars are almost neck and neck. Inside Falfa's car, Laurie looks scared to death. Falfa looks insane as he tromps it. John hits fourth at about eighty-five. Falfa does likewise-- but starts to fish-tail. Laurie closes her eyes, almost crying-- Falfa regains control nervously. Falfa's engine is winding out incredibly and he begins to get the edge on John. The cars rocket through the dawn light along the flashing white line until suddenly Falfa's car blows a tire, his front wheel slips off and the car shoots off into a tomato field, hits an irrigation ditch and begins flipping over wildly in a horrifying cloud of dust and smoke-- John sees the Chevy leaving the road and screams to a halt, swimming through an unbelievable U-turn and high tailing it back to the crash site. He is out of the car like a bullet, running across the dirty cloddy field. The crash car is beginning to burn in the engine compartment and John is panicked. Meanwhile, the spectators have arrived, including Steve, who jumps from his car and is running across the field. Steve and John arrive at the fire at approximately the same time. They stop, the flames are getting higher, burning up into the trees now. Steve looks around wildly--he sees John and goes at him.</context>

      <context>He takes a couple of swings at John, who finally manages to tackle him around the waist. They both get up looking at the flaming wreckage. Then John moves around the side, crouching, trying to see past the flames--suddenly, he stands and motions to Steve to come over. They both circle the wreck. Around behind the flaming car Falfa is standing in a state of shock watching the car go up in smoke, while Laurie is circling him, screaming and beating him with her purse.</context>

      <context>Curt smiles at Terry, who has a bandage on his forehead. Curt looks at John and they don't seem to know what to say. Finally, John gives Curt a little slap on the cheek.</context>

   <speaker>CURT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He walks toward the plane and they all wave. He looks around as he goes up the steps carrying a small bag and a portable radio. The stewardess smiles as he passes her. Above the door of the plane it reads RADAR EQUIPPED. Curt looks back again, then goes inside. The plane takes off down the runway and then climbs up into the sky.</context>
      <utterance>Okay, John. So long.</utterance>
