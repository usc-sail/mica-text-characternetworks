No one seems to be paying him much attention. He turns to leave... ... but something stops him. He can't put his finger on it. There's something wrong here... He stares at the other customers. Why do they avoid eye contact? Are they hiding something? He scrutinizes more closely... There is the gruff trucker, sitting at a nearby table shoveling food in his mouth. He's been averting his gaze ever since Jeff walked in. And then there's the traveling salesman. Overweight, sweaty. Popping vitamins along with his coffee. Or what about the shirtless biker, reading a comic book at the bar? Probably an ex-con. While Jeff is running these suspicions through his mind, a trucker approaches the counter to place an order. The Bartender jots it down on a pad, then tears off the carbon slip. He places one copy above the grill and another in a pile by the cash register. Jeff stares, an idea forming...
