      <context>Scotty stares at Kenny, determined. Kenny looks away. And his eye catches a tall, willowy BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. She is talking, excited, embarrassed, to two more SECRET SERVICE AGENTS. What they're saying is lost in the noise. Scotty follows Kenny's gaze. Then the two men share a look, a silent understanding. Kenny glances at the Secret Service guy holding the car door, tilts his head at the woman.</context>

   <speaker>KENNY</speaker>

      <utterance>IRONBARK reports the SS-4 can deliver a 3-megaton nuclear weapon 1000 miles. So far we have identified 32 missiles served by around 3400 men, undoubtedly all Soviet personnel. Our cities and military installations in the Southeast, as far north as Washington, are in range of these weapons, and in the event of a launch, would only have five minutes of warning.</utterance>

      <utterance>In those five minutes they could kill 80 million Americans and destroy a significant number of our bomber bases, degrading our retaliatory options. The Joint Chiefs' consensus is that this is a massively destabilizing move, upsetting the nuclear balance.</utterance>

   <speaker>RUSK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mr. President, I believe my team is in agreement. If we permit the introduction of nuclear missiles to a Soviet satellite nation in our hemisphere, the diplomatic consequences will be too terrible to contemplate. The Russians are trying to show the world they can do whatever they want, wherever they want, and we're powerless to stop them. If they succeed...</utterance>

   <speaker>RUSK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There's silence at the table. Some nods. Understanding.</context>
      <utterance>Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive. Confidence in our security commitments around the world will falter, allies will become unsure in the face of Soviet pressure, and the Soviets will be emboldened to push us even harder. We must remove the missiles one way or another. It seems to me the options are either to build up the crisis 'til they give in, or we hit them. An air strike.</utterance>

      <utterance>Bob?</utterance>
   <speaker>MCNAMARA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And there it is. The clock is running.</context>
      <utterance>We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational.

      <context>The President leans back in his chair, turns to the man at the far end of the table: DEAN ACHESON, 60s, former Secretary of State. He sits silent, like some revered oracle, the architect of the American Cold War strategy of containment.</context>
      <utterance>Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.</utterance>
   <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Acheson arches an eyebrow, and when he speaks, his voice resonates throughout the room, powerful, smooth, hypnotic.</context>
      <utterance>Dean. What do you think?</utterance>
   <speaker>ACHESON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Everyone in the room listens to him with rapt attention, his presence overshadowing the room, oracular:</context>
      <utterance>Mr. President, you have rightly dismissed the diplomatic option. The Soviet will only tie you down in negotiation, and leave us short of our goal, the removal of the missiles. Negotiating will do nothing more than give them time to make the missiles operational, complicating the necessary military task we have at hand.</utterance>
   <speaker>ACHESON</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>through the cigarette smoke. Acheson's eyes travel to the President.</context>
      <utterance>For the last fifteen years, I have fought here at this table along side your predecessors in the struggle against the Soviet. Gentlemen, I do not wish to seem melodramatic, but I do wish to impress upon you one observation with all conceivable sincerity. A lesson I have learned with bitter tears and great sacrifice.  The Soviet understands only one language: action. It respects only one word: force. Kenny stares at the old man. Acheson's gaze finds his</utterance>
   <speaker>ACHESON</speaker>

      <context>Taylor nods, vindicated. The others murmur their approval. Bobby, at the table in front of Kenny and to his left, trades a dire look with Kenny. This is happening too fast. Bobby holds his head, looks about at the others, deeply distressed. The President sinks back in his chair, staring at Acheson.</context>
      <utterance>I concur with General Taylor. I recommend, sir, air strikes followed by invasion, perhaps preceded by an ultimatum to dismantle the missiles if military necessity permits.</utterance>
   <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then it appears we have three options. Number one. A surgical air strike against the missiles themselves. Two, a larger air strike against their air defenses along with the missiles. Kenny eyes Bobby. Bobby is writing something.</utterance>

      <utterance>We're certainly going to do number one; we're going to take out these missiles, so it seems to me we don't have to wait very long. We ought to at least be making those preparations.</utterance>

      <context>Bundy clears his throat. Speaks from somewhere down the table.</context>

      <context>The President folds the note away, glances at Bobby. A beat, the President looks from Bobby to Acheson.</context>

      <utterance>Dean, how does this play out?</utterance>
   <speaker>ACHESON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Your first step, sir, will be to demand that the Soviet withdraw the missiles within 12 to 24 hours. They will refuse. When they do, you will order the strikes, followed by the invasion. They will resist, but will be overrun. They will retaliate against a target somewhere else in the world, most likely Berlin. We will honor our treaty commitments and resist them there, defeating them per our plans.</utterance>

      <context>The President stares out the window at the Rose Garden, his back to Air Force Chief of Staff GENERAL CURTIS LEMAY, 60. Beetle-browed, arrogant, the archetypal Cold War general. Yet there is something about him, his intelligence perhaps, that suggests he's playing a role he knows and believes in. The only other civilians in the room are Bobby, Bundy and McNamara. The pressure from the military is almost physical.</context>

      <utterance>Mr. President, I believe it is the only course of action. American is in danger. Those missiles are a threat to our bomber bases and the safety of our nuclear deterrent. Without our deterrent, there's nothing to keep the enemy from choosing general nuclear war. It's our duty, our responsibility to the American people to take out those missiles and return stability to the strategic situation.

      <utterance>Mr. President, the motto I chose for SAC is 'Peace is our Profession.' God forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear exchange.

      <utterance>World War One. Thirteen million killed all because the militaries of both alliances were so highly attuned to each other's movements and dispositions, afraid of letting the other guy have a theoretical advantage. And your man in the field, his family at home, couldn't even tell you the reasons why their lives were being sacrificed.  Why couldn't they stop it?</utterance>

      <utterance>And here we are, fifty years later. One of their ships resists the inspection. We shoot out its rudder and board. They shoot down our planes in response. We bomb their anti-aircraft sites in response to that. They attack Berlin. We invade Cuba. They fire their missiles. We fire ours.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mr. President, I agree. Let them go. Four of the six continuing ships are still a day away from the line. They've stopped all the ones we suspect have weapons aboard. It would look bad shooting up a freighter full of baby food.</utterance>

   <speaker>GENERAL TAYLOR</speaker>

      <utterance>Mr. President, taken with the events of the past few hours, I believe this confirms our worst fears. We're now dealing with a hard-line Soviet government, perhaps with Khruschev as a puppet head, perhaps not.</utterance>
   <speaker>KENNY</speaker>

      <context>Bundy enters the room. Everyone looks up. He stands there in the doorway, his face tight. Kenny sags in his chair. Bundy, of course, has more bad news, and they all know it.

      <context></context>
      <utterance>No. The letter is an intentional, but it's having an effect far greater than its authors intended.  What if our Jupiter missiles are just a last minute haggle to salvage something?

      <utterance>You want war...</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dobrynin holds his breath.</context>
      <utterance>However, while there can be no quid pro quo on this issue, the United States can offer a private assurance.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Dobrynin lets out his breath.</context>
      <utterance>Our Jupiter missiles in Turkey are obsolete, and have been scheduled for withdrawal for some time. This withdrawal should be completed within, say, six months.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Dobrynin grasps the move immediately, understanding the ramifications. Still he hesitates a moment.</context>
      <utterance>Of course, any public disclosure of this assurance would negate the deal and produce the most stringent denials from our government.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOBRYNIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOBRYNIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Meaning this is the bone he can show the hard line. Dobrynin struggles internally, knowing what Bobby has done, wanting to hug him. It comes across as agitation.</context>
      <utterance>Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOBRYNIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tomorrow...</utterance>
   <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dobrynin rises from his chair. Bobby rises with him.</context>
      <utterance>Tomorrow...</utterance>
   <speaker>DOBRYNIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dobrynin heads for the door. Half way there he turns back to Bobby, deeply moved. Deeply grateful.</context>
      <utterance>Then you must excuse me and permit me to relay the substance of our discussion to my superiors.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOBRYNIN</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We have heard stories that some among your military men wish for war.  You are a good man. Your brother is a good man. I assure you there are other good men. Let us hope the will of good men is enough to counter the terrible strength of this thing which has been put in motion.</utterance>

The grandness of the world lies before them, and they are deciding its fate, and are humbled by the awfulness of it. The silence is beyond power. And for a long moment, they know not to disturb it. There is nothing left to say. The President, at last, finishes his drink.</context>
