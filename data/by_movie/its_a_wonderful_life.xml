      <context>CAMERA PULLS UP from the Bailey home and travels up through the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly toward a firmament full of stars. As the camera stops we hear the following heavenly voices talking, and as each voice is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly:</context>

      <utterance>Looks like we'll have to send someone down – a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOSEPH'S VOICE</speaker>

      <utterance>That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.</utterance>

      <utterance>Oh – Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOSEPH'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.</utterance>

      <context>A small star flies in from left of screen and stops. It twinkles as Clarence speaks:</context>

      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>FRANKLIN'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.</utterance>

   <speaker>JOSEPH'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The blur on the screen slowly begins to take form. We see a group of young boys on top of a snow-covered hill.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>George is at the door of the office, holding his coat and papers, ready to leave.</context>
      <utterance>Peter Bailey was not a business man. That's what killed him. Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him, God rest his soul. He was a man of high ideals, so-called, but ideals without common sense can ruin this town.  Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop... You know, that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi. You know... I happen to know the bank turned down this loan, but he comes here and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars. Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter. You have all the papers there. His salary, insurance. I can personally vouch for his character.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>George puts down his coat and comes around to the table, incensed by what Potter is saying about his father.</context>
      <utterance>You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say...</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Just a minute – just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was... Why, in the twenty- five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why... Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You... you said... What'd you say just a minute ago?... They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken- down that they... Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about... they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!</utterance>
   <speaker>POTTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>George leaves the room, followed by the jubilant Uncle Billy. Potter's face is grim with hatred. The "frustrated old man" remark was gall in his veins.</context>
      <utterance>I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.  Well, I've said too much. I... You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!</utterance>

      <utterance>Tom! Tom! Randall! Now wait... now listen... now listen to me. I beg of you not to do this thing. If Potter gets hold of this Building and Loan there'll never be another decent house built in this town. He's already got charge of the bank. He's got the bus line. He's got the department stores. And now he's after us. Why? Well, it's very simple. Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why. And because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides. The people are still trying to get out, but some of them</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Joe, you lived in one of his houses, didn't you? Well, have you forgotten? Have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken-down shack?  Here, Ed. You know, you remember last year when things weren't going so well, and you couldn't make your payments. You didn't lose your house, did you? Do you think Potter would have let you keep it?  Can't you understand what's happening here? Don't you see what's happening? Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying! And why? Because we're panicky and he's not. That's why. He's picking up some bargains. Now, we can get through this thing all right. We've got to stick together, though. We've got to have faith in each other.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.</utterance>
   <speaker>POTTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You like it? I'll send you a box.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I... I suppose I'll find out sooner or later, but just what exactly did you want to see me about?</utterance>
   <speaker>POTTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>George, now that's just what I like so much about you.  George, I'm an old man, and most people hate me. But I don't like them either, so that makes it all even. You know just as well as I do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan. You know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of it... or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it. You have been stopping me. In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing. Take during the depression, for instance. You and I were the only ones that kept our heads. You saved the Building and Loan, and I saved all the rest.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.</utterance>
   <speaker>POTTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty- seven, twenty-eight... married, making, say... forty a week.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Forty-five!</utterance>
   <speaker>POTTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, after supporting your mother, and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the ten. Now, if this young man of twenty-eight was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd say he was doing fine. But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel. He's an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man — who hates his job – who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do. A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born. A young man... the smartest one of the crowd, mind you, a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places, because he's trapped. Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters. Do I paint a correct picture, or do I exaggerate?</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now what's your point, Mr. Potter?</utterance>
   <speaker>POTTER</speaker>

      <context>George drops his cigar on his lap. He nervously brushes off the sparks from his clothes.</context>
      <utterance>I want you to manage my affairs, run my properties. George, I'll start you out at twenty thousand dollars a year.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, Mr. Potter, I... I... I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I... I just... I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty- four hours to think it over?</utterance>
   <speaker>POTTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.</utterance>

   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As they shake hands, George feels a physical revulsion. Potter's hand feels like a cold mackerel to him. In that moment of physical contact he knows he could never be associated with this man. George drops his hand with a shudder. He peers intently into Potter's face.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>No... no... no... no, now wait a minute, here! I don't have to talk to anybody! I know right now, and the answer is no! NO! Doggone it!  You sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter! In the... in the whole vast configuration of things, I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider. You...
