   <speaker>RACHEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Frank moves up closer, and exchanges looks with Tony, who is confused by Rachel's behavior. Rachel turns toward Frank and, in so doing, brings the man comforting her around to face Frank. It is Reardon.</context>
      <utterance>Christ, what an idiot I am. Jesus. What the hell's the matter with me?</utterance>
   <speaker>RACHEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Frank barely hears Rachel, so struck is he by Reardon's presence. Frank looks around them quickly for Portman. Rachel looks at Frank with irritation and turns back toward the Green Room. A production aide signals Reardon.</context>
      <utterance>Farmer, you've made me a raving lunatic.</utterance>
   <speaker>REARDON</speaker>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Rachel walks off toward the Green Room with Tony. Reardon starts to walk out toward the stage. Frank stops him. Reardon is irritated.</context>

      <context>Reardon walks out on stage. Frank is left standing alone. All the weariness comes back, all his senses start to hum. Frank looks around, then moves off toward the Green Room.</context>

   <speaker>RACHEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This is the last straw. She throws down the powder and stands up fast, makeup and purse flying. The powder com- pact bursts over the cross lying on the table. Everyone in the Green Room looks at her.</context>

      <context>Tony fakes a glancing blow to Frank's chin. Over by the plane, Fletcher spots Frank and tugs at Rachel's dress, till she turns to look. Fletcher runs up to Frank and hugs him around the knees. Rachel approaches and Tony moves back toward the plane. Devaney waves in Frank's direction, tapping his watch to indicate they are late. Frank waves and smiles. Rachel's surprised to see Frank, but clearly happy. Fletcher is ecstatic.</context>
      <utterance>Under control. But it won't be the same... ya mutt.</utterance>
   <speaker>RACHEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Frank laughs. There is a pause.</context>

      <utterance>I thought I might hole up with my dad.  Finish that chess game.</utterance>

      <context>Frank tries to speak, she puts her hands to his lips.</context>
