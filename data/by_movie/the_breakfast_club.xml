   <speaker>6. INT. LIBRARY - DAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Claire is sitting at the front table. Brian comes in and sits at the table behind her. Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire at the front table. She shrugs and he sits there. In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout desk and takes a few things in the process. He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to the table on the opposite side of the Library. Brian reluctantly gets up and moves. Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his feet up. Allison walks in. She walks all the way around the library and sits in the back corner table, just behind Brian. Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker. Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away. Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher. He holds a stack of papers in his left hand. He addresses the group with such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the job.</context>
      <utterance>There are six tables in two rows of three.</utterance>
   <speaker>VERNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Claire raises her hand.</context>
      <utterance>Well...well. Here we are! I want to congradulate you for being on time...</utterance>
   <speaker>CLAIRE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Vernon doesn't care. He just continues to talk.</context>
      <utterance>Excuse me, sir? I think there's been a mistake. I know it's detention, but...um...I don't think I belong in here...</utterance>
   <speaker>VERNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his mouth again. Claire looks like she is going to gag.</context>
      <utterance>It is now seven-oh-six. You have exactly eight hours and fifty-four minutes to think about why you're here. To ponder the error of your ways...</utterance>
   <speaker>VERNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He glances up at Bender and points at him.</context>
      <utterance>...and you may not talk. You will not move from these seats.</utterance>
   <speaker>VERNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Vernon pulls the chair out from under Bender's feet.</context>
      <utterance>...and you...</utterance>
   <speaker>VERNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...will not sleep. Alright people, we're gonna try something a little different today. We are going to write an essay--of no less than a thousand words--describing to me who you think you are.</utterance>
   <speaker>BENDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice of Bender.</context>
      <utterance>Is this a test?</utterance>
   <speaker>VERNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bender looks up.</context>
      <utterance>And when I say essay...I mean essay. I do not mean a single word repeated a thousand times. Is that clear Mr. Bender?</utterance>
   <speaker>BENDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Crystal...</utterance>
   <speaker>VERNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Brian raises his hand and then stands.</context>
      <utterance>Good. Maybe you'll learn a little something about yourself. Maybe you'll even--decide whether or not you care to return.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>'cause...</context>
      <utterance>You know, I can answer that right now sir...That'd be "No", no for me.</utterance>
   <speaker>VERNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sit down Johnson...</utterance>
   <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He sits.</context>
      <utterance>Thank you sir...</utterance>
   <speaker>VERNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Vernon points.</context>
      <utterance>My office...</utterance>
   <speaker>VERNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He looks around at them.</context>
      <utterance>...is right across that hall. Any monkey business is ill-advised...</utterance>
   <speaker>VERNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...any questions?</utterance>
   <speaker>BENDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Vernon looks at him suspiciously.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah...I got a question.</utterance>
   <speaker>BENDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Does Barry Manilow know you raid his wardrobe?</utterance>
   <speaker>VERNON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Vernon leaves.</context>
      <utterance>I'll give you the answer to that question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday. Don't mess with the bull young man, you'll get the horns.</utterance>
   <speaker>BENDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud snapping sound. Brian turns and looks and it is Allison, biting her nails. Bender's eyes widen as he turns to look. Everyone is looking now. Allison notices them looking at her.</context>
      <utterance>That man...is a brownie hound...</utterance>
   <speaker>BENDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Allison spits part of her nail at Bender.</context>
      <utterance>You keep eating your hand and you're not gonna be hungry for lunch...</utterance>
   <speaker>BENDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We see Brian playing with his pen.</context>
      <utterance>I've seen you before, you know... We see Vernon look out from his office.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top under his upper lip.</context>
      <utterance>Who do I think I am? Who are you? Who are you?</utterance>
   <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bender looks at him in utter confusion. Brian notices this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth-- embarrassed. Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the same time. They both notice this. Brian stops removing his jacket. Bender takes his all the way off. Brian rubs his hands together and pretends to be cold. He pulls his jacket back on. He turns and looks at Bender who is still staring at him.</context>
      <utterance>I am a walrus...</utterance>
   <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable laugh. Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper. He throws it at Claire. It misses and goes over Claire's head. Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore Bender. Bender starts loudly "singing" the musical part of a song. “Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...”</context>
      <utterance>It's the shits, huh?</utterance>
   <speaker>CLAIRE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bender stops "singing" abruptly.</context>
      <utterance>I can't believe this is really happening to me...</utterance>
   <speaker>BENDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, shit! What're we s'posed to do if we hafta take a piss?</utterance>

   <speaker>BENDER</speaker>

      <utterance>If you gotta go...</utterance>
   <speaker>BENDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Everyone is now looking at Bender.</context>

There's fat people that were born to be fat, and then there's fat people that were once thin but they became fat...so when you look at them you can sorta see that thin person inside! You see, you're gonna get married, you're gonna squeeze out a few puppies and then, uh... He mimes becoming fat, making noises.</utterance>

Maybe so, but following a broom around after shitheads like you for the past eight years I've learned a couple of things...I look through your letters, I look through your lockers...I listen to your conversations, you don't know that but I do...I am the eyes and ears of this institution my friends.

      <context></context>
      <utterance>And the bizarre thing is, is that I did it for my old man...I tortured this poor kid, because I wanted him to think that I was cool. He's always going off about, you know, when he was in school...all the wild things he used to do. And I got the feeling that he was disappointed that I never cut loose on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm sitting in the locker room, and I'm taping up my knee. And Larry's undressing a couple lockers down from me. Yeah...he's kinda... he's kinda skinny, weak. And I started thinking about my father, and his attitude about weakness. And the next thing I knew, I uh, I jumped on top of him and started wailing on him...And my friends, they just laughed and cheered me on. And afterwards, when I was sittin' in Vernon's office, all I could think about was Larry's father. And Larry havin' to go home and...and explain what happened to him. And the humiliation...fucking humiliation he mustuv felt. It mustuv been unreal...I mean,  I mean, how do you apologize for something like that? There's no way...it's all because of me and my old man. Oh God, I fucking hate him! He's like this...he's like this mindless machine that I can't even relate to anymore..."Andrew, you've got to be number one! I won't tolerate any losers in this family...Your intensity is for shit! Win. Win! WIN!!!" You son of a bitch! You know, sometimes, I wish my knee would give...and I wouldn't be able to wrestle anymore. And he could forget all about me...</utterance>

      <utterance>It's like me, you know, with my grades...like, when I, when I step outside myself kinda, and when I, when I look in at myself you know? And I see me and I don't like what I see, I really don't.</utterance>

   <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing shop. See we had this assignment, to make this ceramic elephant, and um...and we had eight weeks to do it and we're s'posed ta, and it was like a lamp, and when you pull the trunk the light was s'posed to go on...my light didn't go on, I got a F on it. Never got a F in my life... When I signed up, you know, for the course I mean. I thought I was playing it real smart, you know.

   <speaker>CLAIRE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came walking up to you in the hall on Monday, what would you do? I mean picture this, you're there with all the sports. I know exactly what you'd do, you'd say hi to him and when he left you'd cut him all up so your friends wouldn't think you really liked him!</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>No! 'Cause you know how shitty that is to do to someone! And you don't got the balls to stand up to your friends and tell 'em that you're gonna like who you wanna like!</utterance>
   <speaker>CLAIRE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Okay, what about you, you hypocrite! Why don't you take Allison to one of your heavy metal vomit parties? Or take Brian out to the parking lot at lunch to get high? What about Andy for that matter, what about me? What would your friends say if we were walking down the hall together. They'd laugh their asses off and you'd probably tell them you were doing it with me so they'd forgive you for being seen with me.</utterance>
   <speaker>BENDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't you ever talk about my friends! You don't know any of my friends, you don't look at any of my friends and you certainly wouldn't condescend to speak to any of my friends so you just stick to the things you know, shopping, nail polish, your father's BMW and your poor--rich--drunk mother in the Carribean!</utterance>

      <utterance>And as far as being concerned about what's gonna happen when you and I walk down the hallways at school, you can forget it! 'Cause it's never gonna happen! Just bury your head in the sand...and wait for your fuckin' prom!</utterance>
