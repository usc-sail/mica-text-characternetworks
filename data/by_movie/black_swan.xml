      <context>Using the mirror, Nina monitors her movements carefully. The mistress surprises her.</context>
      <utterance>To the back, fondu, to the back, plie. Fourth, fourth, and one and fifth, to the back...  Like this. Push it. Why can't you do this?</utterance>
   <speaker>BALLET MISTRESS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Flustered, Nina nods and tries to follow her instruction. Suddenly, the girls around Nina begin stripping off their sweatshirts and insulated pants. Nina sees that the intense and brooding director of the company, THOMAS LEROY, has entered the space. He has the unkept look of an artist. Magnetic and intense. The ballerinas remove their warm-up gear to show off their bodies. Leroy walks around the room, judging his flock. Smiles and glances are thrown his way. He goes up to the ballet mistress, takes her hand and kisses her on the cheek. Even she manages a smile.</context>
      <utterance>It needs to be looser. Relax. Let it flow.</utterance>

      <utterance>He heads to the line of soloists, studying them.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEROY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He taps a dancer on the shoulder, she lights up. He walks, then taps another. A selection process of some kind. Nina looks nervous, has an inkling of what it means.</context>
      <utterance>We all know the story: virginal girl, pure and sweet, trapped in the body of a swan. She desires freedom, but only true love can break the spell.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEROY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He nears Nina. She sneaks peeks at him, eager and hopeful. He acknowledges her with a small nod and a smile. But he walks on without tapping her. She deflates.</context>
      <utterance>Her wish is granted in the form of a prince.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEROY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He approaches the New Girl. Nina watches, threatened. But he doesn't tap her either.</context>
      <utterance>But before he can declare his love, her lustful twin, the Black Swan, tricks and seduces him.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEROY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>The music stops and all the girls face him, attentive.</context>
      <utterance>Devastated, the White Swan leaps off a cliff, killing herself. But, in death, finds freedom. He taps one more soloist and then CLAPS.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEROY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>They respond "Good morning" in nervous, unsure voices.</context>
      <utterance>Good morning, company.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEROY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He pauses for effect.</context>
      <utterance>We open our season with Swan Lake. Done to death, I know. But not like this. We strip it down. Make it visceral and real.</utterance>

   <speaker>LEROY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Nina prepares for disappointment.</context>

      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Nina breathes, realizing the girls he didn't tap are the ones he's selected, purposefully toying with them.</context>

      <context>Beth scoffs as she slams the door behind her. She clips down the hall in the opposite direction. Nina waits until she's gone, then moves closer to the door and peeks inside, curious. She checks to make sure no one's around and quickly enters.</context>

      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Nervous, she glances over at Veronica and Galina, who anxiously await their turn. She takes a few breaths, then looks towards the piano player and nods. The music begins. Nina dances a few steps, and then launches into the most difficult and famous part of Swan Lake: The Black Swan's Coda. It consists of 32 consecutive fouettes (spins).</context>
      <utterance>Show me your Black Swan, Nina.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEROY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>The music builds in intensity, she pushes herself into the next turn.</context>
      <utterance>Come on, not so controlled.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEROY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>A look of worry spreads across Nina's face. Knows she's blowing it. The door CLANGS open and throws Nina's focus completely. She stumbles, several spins short of finishing.</context>
      <utterance>Seduce us! Not just the Prince, but the court, the audience, the entire world! The fouettes are like a spider spinning her web. Come on! Attack it! Attack it! Leroy runs his hand through his hair, dismayed.</utterance>

      <mode>O.S. - FROM KITCHEN</mode>
      <context>Nina sits up and retrieves a pair of point shoes from her bag. She considers them for a moment, then starts to put them on. She stands, takes a breath, and does a single spin, testing the waters. She takes a breath and spins again, then again, then again. Each spin is punctuated by a jab of her foot into the floor.</context>
      <utterance>I told them it doesn't matter how talented their daughter is, if she misses any more classes, she's out. She forgets half of what I teach her, and I waste time catching her up. It's ridiculous.</utterance>

She reassumes the position, takes a couple breaths, and starts spinning again. Her toe jabs into the floor. She winces a little with pain, but keeps pushing. Her face grows more determined, focused. 20, 21, 22 spins.... She starts to look powerful, willing herself to succeed.</context>

Relieved, she grabs Lily and kisses her, revved-up. Lily responds with equal force. They claw at each other, passion exceeding coordination. Lily pulls Nina's shirt off and throws her onto the bed. She straddles Nina, who looks up at her carnivorously. Lily takes her own top off, plunges down and kisses Nina. Nina flips Lily over, becomes the dominant one. Lily scratches Nina's back, over some of the rash. There's subtle movement underneath the skin. Little pin pricks push up the flesh, trailing behind her hand. Self-conscious, Nina grabs Lily's hand and holds her wrists down. She bites her neck. Lily smiles, likes the violence. She digs her nails into Nina's hands. Then Lily gets back on top of Nina. The tattooed lilies on her back undulate and spread out. Morphing into dark wings. She kisses down Nina's body. Further and further...</context>

No body whatsoever. She looks over at the broken mirror. Sees her reflection staring back at her. She stares at it for a long beat, and realizes something. She touches her stomach and winces a little. Pulls back her hand. It's coated with red liquid. Blood. It's started to soak through the costume, creating a faint red spot. The fabric is ripped at the center of the stain. She feels inside for confirmation. And discovers a stab wound, in her own stomach. She pulls out the sharp tip of mirror still stuck inside.
