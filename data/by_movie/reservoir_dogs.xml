      <utterance>"Like a Virgin" is all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick. The whole song is a metaphor for big dicks.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BLUE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No it's not. It's about a girl who is very vulnerable and she's been fucked over a few times. Then she meets some guy who's really sensitive--</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>--Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay. Tell that bullshit to the tourists.</utterance>

      <utterance>Toby...who the fuck is Toby? Toby...Toby...think...think...</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. ORANGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Which one is "True Blue?"</utterance>
   <speaker>NICE GUY EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You don't remember "True Blue?" That was a big ass hit for Madonna. Shit, I don't even follow this Tops In Pops shit, and I've at least heard of "True Blue."</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. ORANGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look, asshole, I didn't say I ain't heard of it. All I asked was how does it go? Excuse me for not being the world's biggest Madonna fan.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BROWN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I hate Madonna.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BLUE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I like her early stuff. You know, "Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but once she got into her "Papa Don't Preach" phase, I don't know, I tuned out.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's that?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Where was I?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. ORANGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You said "True Blue" was about a nice girl who finds a sensitive fella. But "Like a Virgin" was a metaphor for big dicks.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Let me tell ya what "Like a Virgin"'s about. It's about some cooze who's a regular fuck machine. I mean all the time, morning, day, night, afternoon, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BLUE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How many dicks was that?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A lot.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin tunnels. Now she's gettin this serious dick action, she's feelin something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Chew? Toby Chew? No.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin." The fellas crack up.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>

      <context></context>

      <utterance>Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry-fucking-Vale.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand. They fight, but they're not really mad at each other.</context>
      <utterance>Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby...Toby...Toby... Toby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't- know-what, outta my left.</utterance>

   <speaker>JOE</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BLONDE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICE GUY EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?</utterance>
   <speaker>NICE GUY EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Can you believe the songs they been playin?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat - It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin grade.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICE GUY EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>When I was coming down here, I was playin it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million- trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BLUE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You didn't know Vicki Lawrence killed the guy?</utterance>
   <speaker>NICE GUY EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I thought the cheatin wife shot Andy.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BLONDE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They say it in the song.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICE GUY EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know, I heard it. I musta zoned out whenever that part came on before. I thought when she said that little sister stuff, she was talkin about her sister- in-law, the cheatin wife.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, she did it. She killed the cheatin wife, too.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The table laughs. The WAITRESS comes over to the table. She has the check, and a pot of coffee.</context>
      <utterance>You know the part in "Gypsies, Tramps and Theives," when she says "Poppa woulda shot his if he knew what he'd done?" I could never figure out what he did.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAITRESS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Can I get anybody more coffee.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She hands the bill to him.</context>
      <utterance>No, we're gonna be hittin it. I'll take care of the check.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAITRESS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Here ya go. Please pay at the register, if you wouldn't mind.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sure thing.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAITRESS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They all mutter equivalents. She exits and Joe stands up.</context>
      <utterance>You guys have a wonderful day.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sorry, it's my book now.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger. Mr White acts shot. Joe exits.</context>
      <utterance>Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?</utterance>
   <speaker>NICE GUY EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table. Everybody, that is, except Mr. White.</context>
      <utterance>Okay, everybody cough up green for the little lady.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICE GUY EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>C'mon, throw in a buck.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Uh-uh. I don't tip.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICE GUY EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Whaddaya mean you don't tip?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't believe in it.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICE GUY EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You don't believe in tipping?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I love this kid, he's a madman, this guy.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BLONDE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do you have any idea what these ladies make? They make shit.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Everybody laughs.</context>
      <utterance>Don't give me that. She don't make enough money, she can quit.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICE GUY EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin their job.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BLUE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Our girl was nice.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Our girl was okay. She didn't do anything special.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BLONDE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They all laugh.</context>
      <utterance>What's something special, take ya in the kitchen and suck your dick?</utterance>
   <speaker>NICE GUY EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'd go over twelve percent for that.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WRITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BLONDE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What if she's too busy?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The words "too busy" shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICE GUY EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They all laugh.</context>
      <utterance>Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last thing you need is another cup of coffee.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>These ladies aren't starvin to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICE GUY EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard--</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. ORANGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>--It is that too--</utterance>
   <speaker>NICE GUY EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>--It is that too. But it's also he couldn't get a waiter job. You talk like a pissed off dishwasher: "Fuck those cunts and their fucking tips."</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BLONDE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mr. White rubs two of his fingers together.</context>
      <utterance>So you don't care that they're counting on your tip to live?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BLONDE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. ORANGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They work harder than the kids at McDonald's.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh yeah, I don't see them cleaning fryers.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BROWN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>These people are taxed on the tips they make. When you stiff 'em, you cost them money.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BLONDE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The reason is because of tips.</context>
      <utterance>Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one jab basically any woman can get, and make a living on.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They all laugh.</context>
      <utterance>Fuck all that.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, I'm very sorry that the government taxes their tips. That's fucked up. But that ain't my fault. it would appear that waitresses are just one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis. You show me a paper says the government shouldn't do that, I'll sign it. Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it. But what I won't do is play ball. And this non- college bullshit you're telling me, I got two words for that: "Learn to fuckin type." Cause if you're expecting me to help out with the rent, you're in for a big fuckin surprise.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. ORANGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Everybody laughs. Joe's comes back to the table.</context>
      <utterance>He's convinced me. Give me my dollar back.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?</utterance>

      <context>Normally I wouldn't.</context>
      <utterance>Because you paid for the breakfast, I'm gonna tip.</utterance>

      <context>The eight men get up to leave. Mr. White's waist is in the F.G. As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's carrying a gun. They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House, talking amongst themselves.</context>
      <utterance>Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, and let's move.  See what I'm dealing with here. Infants. I'm fuckin dealin with infants.</utterance>

One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. but those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?</utterance>

      <context>Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.</context>
      <utterance>He scared the fuckin shit outta me. I thought he was dead fer sure.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>We can't take him to a hospital.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a C.U. of Mr. White.</context>
      <utterance>Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode>OS</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians...Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode>OS</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well Joe ain't gettin here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.</utterance>

   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode>OS</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin about us, I say it's his decision.</utterance>

      <utterance>No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin toilet!"  I'm not tellin tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole I got an honest-to- goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. I can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin back before ten o'clock curfew.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>We can work this out, can't we?</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIC</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't wanna lift crates.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Koons thinkin "what the fuck." And if Koons ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your jab is goin different places - and we got places all over the place.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.</utterance>

      <utterance>Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.</utterance>

      <utterance>That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?</utterance>

      <utterance>--Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Koons fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Vic has no idea what they're talking about.</context>
      <utterance>Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him. Joe looks at Vic.</utterance>

      <utterance>What's the exposure like?</utterance>
   <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's a hold up, daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you have the fellas to deal with the crowd. It's a jewelry store. They're getting a big shipment of South African diamonds on a certain day. They're like a way station. It's gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Hamburg. When you walk through the door, you'll know right where to go for the rich stones. The fellas are good, me and Nice Guy picked em. Nobody knows anybody else. Nobody's connected. I don't use connected guys for this shit.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIC</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's the cut?</utterance>

      <context>Stealer's Wheel's hit "Stuck in the Middle with You" PLAYS over the speaker. NOTE: This entire sequence is timed to the music. Mr. Blonde slowly walks toward the cop. He opens a large knife. He grabs a chair, places it in front of the cop and sits in it. Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, holding the knife, singing along with the song. Then, like a cobra, he LASHES out. A SLASH across the face. The cop/camera moves around wildly. Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, singing along with the seventies hit. Then he reaches out and CUTS OFF the cop's/our ear. The cop/camera moves around wildly. Mr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop/us to see. Mr. Blonde rises, kicking the chair he was sitting on out of the way.</context>

About a year and a half ago, up in Sacramento, an undercover cop, John Dolenz, worked his way into a bank job. Apparently before the job they found out he was a cop. Now picture this: It's Dolenz's birthday, a bunch of cops are waiting in his apartment for a surprise party. The door opens, everyone yells "Surprise!", and standing in the doorway is Dolenz and this other guy sticking a gun in Dolenz's ribs. Before anybody knows what's going on, this stranger shoots Dolenz dead and starts firing two .45 automatics into the crowd.</utterance>

      <utterance>Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Elois?</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. WHITE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Where was she from, Compton?</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No. She was from Ladora Heights.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater-upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Pam Grier.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, it wasn't Pan Grier, Pan Grier was the other one. Pan Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. PINK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin tortured now.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her.</utterance>
   <speaker>FREDDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do things? What would he do? You mean like beat her up?</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nobody knows for sure what he did. We just know he did something. Anyway, Elois plays it real cool. And waits for the next time this bag of shit gets drunk. So one night the guy gets drunk and passes out on the couch. So while the guy's inebriated, she strips him naked. Then she takes some crazy glue and glues his dick to his belly. The car reacts to how horrible that would be.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The car reacts badly.</context>
      <utterance>I'm dead fuckin serious. She put some on his dick and some on his belly, then stuck 'em together. The paramedics had to come and cut it loose.</utterance>

      <context>Freddy shits a brick.</context>
      <utterance>No hurry.  All right, let's get to know one another. With the exception of Eddie and myself, who you already know, you'll be using aliases. Under no circumstances are you to tell one another your real name or anything else about yourself. That includes where you're from, your wife's name, where you might've done time, about a bank in St. Petersburg you might've robbed. You guys don't say shit about who you are, where you been or what you've done. Only thing you guys can talk about is what you're going to do. This way the only ones who know who the members of the team are are Eddie and myself. And that's the way I like it. Because in the unlikely event of one of you getting apprehended by the cops, not that I expect that to happen - it most definitely should not happen - it hasn't happened, you don't have anything to deal with. You don't know any names. You know my name, you know Eddie's name. That I don't care about. You gotta prove it. I ain't worried. Besides, this way you gotta trust me. I like that. I set this up and picked the men I wanted for it. None of you came to me, I approached all of you. I know you. I know your work, I know your reputation. I know you as men. Except for this guy.

You gotta make sure they don't have to move in. You're inside to make sure that everything goes according to Hoyle. We have men set up a block away from the warehouse rendezvous.

      <context></context>
      <utterance>The whole idea behind this operation is to catch Joe Cabot red-handed. We bust these hired hands, we ain't accomplished shit. Letting them go through with the heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs are very clean. We got people surrounding the perimeter. We got a guy and a gal on the inside posing as a couple shopping for rings. We could replace the employees with cops, but we'd run the risk of tipping 'em off.</utterance>

      <utterance>When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a- bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear.

      <utterance>You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>I'm correct about that, right?</context>
      <utterance>Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. ORANGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange has said. Finally:</context>
      <utterance>Eddie, you can believe me or not believe me, but it's the truth. I swear on my mother's eternal soul that's what happened. The CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're a fuckin liar. Now why don't you drop the fuckin fairy tale and tell me what really happened?</utterance>

      <utterance>He told you what really happened.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. ORANGE</speaker>
      <mode>OS</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Okay, you're right, I'm lying. Even though I'm fuckin dyin I'm not above pullin a fast one. Get rid of Blonde, we share his split - no, scratch that, I shot him 'cause I didn't like his hair style. I didn't like his shoes either. If it has just been his hair, I'd've maybe, maybe I said, let him live. But hair and footwear together, he's a goner.</utterance>
   <speaker>EDDIE</speaker>

      <context>Silence.</context>
      <utterance>The man you killed was just released from prison. He got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items. He could've walked away. All he had to do was say my dad's name. But instead he shut his mouth and did his time. He did four years for us, and he did 'em like a man. And we were very grateful. So, Mr. Orange, you're tellin me this very good friend of mine, who did four years for my father, who in four years never made a deal, no matter what they dangled in front of him, you're telling me that now, that now this man is free, and we're making good on our commitment to him, he's just gonna decide, right out of the fuckin blue, to rip us off?</utterance>
