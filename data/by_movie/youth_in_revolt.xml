      <context>A view of the drawer reveals it to be filled with neatly filed issues of Penthouse and Hustler. He puts the most recently utilized magazine in its place.</context>

      <context>JERRY, early 40's, saunters in wearing a TRUCKERS DO IT IN OVERDRIVE shirt and boxers. His gut hangs over the elastic, but he is completely devoid of an ass.</context>
      <utterance>She used to keep Dad up to date on all the motor statutes he was violating. This is one of the reasons they got divorced.</utterance>

      <context>Jerry smiles with cretin pride. Nick looks to his mother and disturbingly enough, she seems turned on by his car-owner savvy.</context>
      <utterance>Sold it to a sailor on the Alameda Naval Air Base. A man should never own a car for more than three months, Estelle. That way he always gets the thrill of owning a new automobile!</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>The second sailor holds aloft the banana peel sealed in a plastic bag. Nick glances to drive and regards the smoking Chevy-Nova with its camouflage paint job. A THIRD SAILOR is rummaging through the boxes in the open garage. He finds some spray-paint and shakes the can. Nick turns back to the sailors on the stoop.</context>
      <utterance>And we found evidence of a banana in the transmission.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAILOR #1</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So he owes us nine hundred dollars.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I think he used that nine hundred dollars to buy his Lincoln. He's giving my mom a joyride in it now. But he'll be back this afternoon, so I would come back then. He's pretty stubborn. You might have to beat it out of him.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAILOR #1</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nick looks one more time to the Chevy as the third sailor finishes painting the hood with the words: PAY UP OR DIE.</context>
      <utterance>That can be arranged. In the meantime we're leaving the piece of shit in the driveway. With a note.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The sailors nod, somewhat perplexed by this kid's demeanor. As they turn to go and Nick closes the door...</context>
