      <context>Rodriguez stands up, moves back to the window. Divinci looks up.</context>
      <utterance>But I gotta get at least a forty footer. It'll handle rough water better and I'll need the room if I'm gonna live on it.</utterance>

      <utterance>Look, I'm not in Hawaii, I'm here. But I don't want to be here, I want to be in Hawaii. I can't be in Hawaii, therefore I think about it so as to not get depressed about being here.</utterance>
   <speaker>RODRIGUEZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But I'm here, I know I'm here, I don't like being here, but I can't be anyplace else because I look around and I see all this shit. How do you get around that?! That's what I'm asking.</utterance>

   <speaker>HUDD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Cynthia runs her hands over Hudd, checking pockets, pants, sleeves. Finally coming to his crotch. Hudd smiles.</context>

   <speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She smiles back at Hudd. Then moves away, sits on the couch and seductively crosses her legs. Divinci, satisfied, pulls a PLASTIC BAG packed tight with COCAINE out of his pocket, tosses it to Hudd. Hudd sits on the couch, opens the bag, sticks his finger in and tastes the contents. But never takes his eyes off Divinci.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hudd stands, unzips his pants. Reaches in to grab his cock, but instead, pulls out a stack of MONEY. Inch thick.</context>
      <utterance>Maybe.</utterance>
   <speaker>HUDD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hudd hands the money to Divinci and pockets the plastic bag. Then crosses to the door. Glances back at Cynthia.</context>
      <utterance>Told you there was a lotta good hidin' places on this body.</utterance>

   <speaker>VIC</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I apologize. I understand your concerns. But you must understand that, unlike a bank, I cannot rely on a late fee as sufficient encouragement to repay one's debts. I am forced to employ the likes of Mr. Cutless Supreme, whom I might add, contributes significantly to my overhead. I am the real loser here. And I am concerned about your sincerity in repaying the twenty- seven thousand, nine hundred forty- two dollar gambling debt that is one week past due. What can you do to reassure me of your good intentions?</utterance>
   <speaker>RODRIGUEZ</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I can make your life fuckin' miserable that's what I can do.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIC</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Rodriguez steps toward Vic, but Cutless Supreme slides in between them. Rodriguez isn't going to win this one.</context>
      <utterance>Look at me. Do I have a wife and three kids? Do I have a good job at IBM? Am I a handsome guy? No, no and no. I loan money at excessively high interest rates to pricks like you who can't control their urges to lose big money playing cards and then I am forced to stay up all night trying to convince them that I have needs, too. The point of which is, I already have a fuckin' miserable life. So don't threaten me you lousy bag of cat shit.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIC</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Rodriguez backs off, hesitates as he runs over his options. There aren't any. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out some of his night's earnings.</context>
      <utterance>All I'm askin' is that you be responsible. Is that unreasonable?</utterance>
   <speaker>RODRIGUEZ</speaker>

      <utterance>Four thousand is all I got.</utterance>
   <speaker>VIC</speaker>

   <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>

   <speaker>HELEN</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Objection. Your honor, I don't see a point to this line of questioning.</utterance>

   <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, your honor. Since this is the only witness, I'm trying to establish what the scene was like that night.</utterance>
   <speaker>JUDGE HAROLD PINE</speaker>

   <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And how far away from the corner was the Mini-mart? For example was it in the middle of the block, close to the corner, where?</utterance>
   <speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>In the middle I think.</utterance>
   <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So you walked all the way to the corner. I assume then you were walking back to your car, yes?</utterance>
   <speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...yeah.</utterance>

   <speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Um... there were lots of cars parked on the street.</utterance>
   <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Was there anyone else on the street besides you?</utterance>
   <speaker>CYNTHIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No.</utterance>
   <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Lots of cars, but no people. Any traffic?</utterance>

   <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I didn't see anybody else.</utterance>
   <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>

      <context>Arthur turns dramatically to Cynthia. She is scared.</context>
      <utterance>I'm not trying to confuse the witness, it's the witness that's trying to confuse the court. I have witnesses who will refute her testimony. Witnesses who were on that corner the night of the shooting, who never saw Ms. Webb, who never heard the gunshot, who never saw Joe run past. Ms Webb saw Joe outside her apartment building that night because he lived in the alley next to it. Isn't that right, Ms Webb?</utterance>
   <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
