Hey Wanda, next time can you wear a shirt that's a little more distracting to my actors!  Hey Bob! Hi Bob! Can you please make a little more noise on the dolly you creaky motherfucker!  What is your name!? What do you fucking do around here?!  Hey Speedo, what's the matter? Can't even find a teeny fucking beep?!</utterance>

      <context>Palomino suddenly punches Nick in the stomach, leaving him bent over and gasping for breath. Nicole instantly leaps on Palomino's back and begins pounding her fist on the top of his head. Palomino spins wildly trying to dislodge her as Wanda rushes forward.</context>

   <speaker>WANDA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As she tries to separate Nicole and Palomino, Palomino shoves her hard, knocking her down. Instantly Wolf leaps off the camera and runs up to Palomino.</context>

   <speaker>WANDA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>NICOLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nicole rolls free as Nick and Palomino wrestle on the bed. Nick gets Palomino in a vicious headlock and starts pounding his head against the mattress.</context>

   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As Nick continues to pound Palomino's head the Gaffer notices Palomino's eyes are starting to bug out from the pressure of Nick's forearm around his neck. He and the Boom man rush forward and finally manage to pry Palomino free.</context>

   <speaker>SCRIPT</speaker>

Cora finally stops circling Nicole and stops abruptly. Suddenly she raises the apple right out in front of Nicole. Wolf glides forward with the camera, framing an amazing CU of the apple with Nicole seen behind it. Nicole reaches out, grabs the apple and takes a huge, resounding bite out of it. CU Nick's face, eyes wide in anxious delight. Cora takes one step forward. CU her fuzzy slippers stopping right on the yellow tape mark.

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly, on an impulse surprising both of them, Nick and Nicole embrace. Just then Wanda steps up.</context>
      <utterance>You were great, you're a natural. And Nicole, that was beautiful. Don't you dare tell me that felt fake.</utterance>

      <utterance>Going again, Nick?</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The set grows suddenly quiet as Nick begins pacing rapidly, muttering to himself.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, hold on. Let me think a second.</utterance>
   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nick suddenly looks up and sees everybody staring at him; Nicole in her wedding gown, Wolf with his eyepatch, his mother still eating the apple, Wanda, the crew.</context>
      <utterance>Can I use it for the Dream Sequence, that's the question. Does it work for the Dream Sequence?</utterance>

      <utterance>I need to record room tone. I'll need thirty seconds of silence.</utterance>
   <speaker>WANDA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, alright! Quiet. Quiet! Shut up!! Thirty seconds of room tone. The sooner you're quiet the sooner we're done.</utterance>

   <speaker>NICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>At that moment a door opens at the rear of the set and a DOCTOR and NURSE enter. The Nurse carries an extra overcoat. Jeff, the Driver, turns and sternly whispers for them to be quiet.</context>
      <utterance>It's for the sound, Mom. We just have to be quiet.</utterance>
   <speaker>WANDA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And roll sound. Nobody move.</utterance>
