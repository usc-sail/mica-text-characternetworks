      <context>The announcer's voice and excited crowd abruptly cut off. In silence, we regard the 60,000 empty seats that wrap around the playing field ... but then see that, in fact, it's 59,999 empty seats. There's a lone figure seated in one of them. The sound snaps back on:</context>

      <context>The lone man in the stadium has a radio and a bag of peanuts. He seems at peace as he looks down on the empty diamond - a peace only slightly belied, perhaps, by the baseball he absently turns in a hand. He switches the radio back on -</context>

      <context>The outcome of the series seems to have no effect on Billy. He simply gets up, switches off the radio, and climbs the steps to leave. But somehow we still faintly hear, as he comes past shuttered concession stands toward an exit, the voice of one of the announcers -</context>
      <utterance>It is bedlam in New York. The Yankees - down two games to none - have come back to win three, and the Division Series.</utterance>

      <utterance>Okay, stop. The problem we're trying to solve is that this is an unfair game. There are rich teams, poor teams, 50 feet of crap and then there's us. And now we've been gutted. We're organ donors to the rich. The Red Sox took our kidneys and the Yankees took our heart. And now I'm listening to the same old shit about having a good body and being a tools guy like you're looking for Fabio. Is there another first baseman like Giambi?</utterance>

      <utterance>Grady, you don't have special powers. You don't have the ability to look at a guy and "just know" because you're a scout with special powers. I've watched you sit at kitchen tables for years and tell the parents of a 17 year old kid, "Trust me, when I know, I know, and when it comes to your son, I know" and you don't. We're shopping in a new store--full of complicated statistical analysis and equations and I get that it turns your world upside down but on base percentage-- our best chance to score on our budget isn't getting a 6'4" Adonis to the plate, it's getting a 5'10" washout who's already at first base.</utterance>

   <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Understand what I'm saying?</context>
      <utterance>Basically, these are all your at bats. This is you versus righties, you versus lefties... and then, of course, all your count knowledge, okay? In an 0-0 count you're batting .290. In an 0-1 you average .238. In a 0-2, .159. When you're 1-0, you're batting .324.</utterance>

   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>PAUL hits the remote and the tape starts. The quality is poor and the camera is focused only on Jeremy.</context>
      <utterance>The Visalia Oaks and their 240 pound catcher, Jeremy Brown, who's scared of running to second. This was in a game six weeks ago.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We see JEREMY BROWN connect and the ball fly off the bat but the camera stays on JEREMY running to first. PAUL slows down the picture with the remote</context>
      <utterance>This guy's gonna start him off with a fastball low and in because he hasn't read the book on our guy and doesn't know that low and in is where he eats. Jeremy takes him to deep center --</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>-- and he knows that if he runs it's a stand-up double and he's running.</utterance>

      <utterance>And now he's gonna do something he never does. He's gonna round first base, he's gonna take the turn.</utterance>

      <utterance>No. Because right here -- JEREMY slips and stumbles to the ground.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JEREMY has been scrambling in the dirt to get safely back to first base.</context>
      <utterance>-- is what he's always been afraid of. It's all he can do to get himself back to first.</utterance>

   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>JEREMY's looking around the field now, looking at his own dugout. We can't see what he sees but he's confused.</context>
      <utterance>Everybody's laughing.</utterance>
   <speaker>PAUL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And JEREMY's face explodes into a smile. He slaps hands with the first base coach and begins his trot around the bases. BILLY stares at this. He takes the remote and backs it up a little so he can see Jeremy's face again.</context>
      <utterance>And now Jeremy finds out why. Watch his face because this is art. He's just found out the ball went 60 feet over the fence. He'd hit a home run but he didn't know it.</utterance>
