      <utterance>Now, pay attention, Nursy. The Queen, Gloriana Regina, God's Chosen Vessel, the Radiant One, who shines her light on us, is at Greenwich today, and prepared, during the evening's festivities, to bestow her gracious favour on my choice of wife--and if we're late for lunch, the old boot will not forgive. So you get you to my lady's chamber and produce her with or without her undergarments.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They are not acted for you, they are acted for me. VIOLA remains silent, in apology. ANGLE on WILL. He is watching and listening. He has never seen the QUEEN so close. He is fascinated.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>The QUEEN passes by, and as WESSEX comes vertical again, we see his face a mask of furious realisation.</context>
      <utterance>Fifty pounds! A very worthy sum on a very worthy question. Can a play show us the very truth and nature of love? I bear witness to the wager, and will be the judge of it as occasion arises.  I have not seen anything to settle it yet.  So--the fireworks will be soothing after the excitements of Lady Viola's audience.  Have her then, but you are a lordly fool. She has been plucked since I saw her last, and not by you. It takes a woman to know it.</utterance>

   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>BURBAGE aims a blow at WILL, who ducks and grabs a stave from the nearest actor, and parries the blow. He swings at BURBAGE, a CHAMBERLAIN'S MAN swings at WILL, THOMAS cries out, someone else slashes the stage hangings bringing down the drapes, and in a moment the ADMIRAL'S MEN and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, using their much rehearsed skills, are brawling with weapons and fist, using everything short of unbuttoned rapiers. CRAB, the dog, is yapping and snapping at any legs he can reach. HENSLOWE, a little slow to catch up on the situation, checks the page in his hand. FENNYMAN, much slower to catch up, watches enthralled.</context>

   <speaker>WILL</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He gets back onto the stage, where the goings on are worthy of the Four Musketeers and Robin Hood combined, with SAM GOSSE, dressed as "JULIET," fighting with the best of them. There is a stack of cushions, stored for the expensive seats, and as the stack s knocked over, NED ALLEYN and others grab cushions to use as shields. Soon cushions are being ripped, and the air is full of flying feathers. The trap door in the stage opens, VIOLA'S head pops up. She looks around and, surrounded by milling legs and floating feathers, a boot catches her sideways and half knocks her wig off. In danger of having her cover blown, she ducks down again, leaving the trap open just nicely for Will to plummet down it.</context>

      <context>And he delivers a telling blow to a passing CHAMBERLAIN'S MAN, who wheels off the stage. LAMBERT meanwhile is making short work of the rest of the opposition, receiving help with the thorny business of identification from SAM. Stray members of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN are running from the theatre, as BURBAGE, fighting a heroic last stand, is tipped backwards by FENNYMAN off the stage and into a bucket of swill. A PAUSE. Then NED starts applauding. The others, weary from fighting, start applauding too, from all levels of the theatre. FENNYMAN looks around, starting to beam, as a din of encores and bravos engulf him.

      <context>That goes down every well with the entire COMPANY except for VIOLA and WILL. He looks at her, helplessly, then makes as if to say something. VIOLA ducks away from him and blunders blindly out of the street door, in tears. VIOLA passes PETER who is coming in from the street. WILL, attempting to follow VIOLA, is grabbed round the shoulders by PETER who, we now see, is in a highly emotional state. WILL tries to fight him off but PETER has the strength of the news he brings.</context>
