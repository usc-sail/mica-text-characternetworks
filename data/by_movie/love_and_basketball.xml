   <speaker>YOUNG VOICE</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>CAMERA REVEALS: QUINCY MCCALL, eleven years old, dribbling a basketball in front of KELVIN and JAMAL, also eleven. He sports a fro, a "Clippers" jersey, and a serious swagger.</context>
      <utterance>You wanna be Kareem?</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All his big butt do is stand by the basket.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAMAL</speaker>

   <speaker>KELVIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm gonna be like Dr. J.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'ma be like my Dad.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAMAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He ain't a star or nothing.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't see none of your sorry daddies in the NBA.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELVIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Quincy follows Kelvin's eyes, to a beat-up pair of Converse All-Stars approaching from next door. Walking in the kicks is a YOUNG KID in a T-shirt and Tuff-skins, and a LAKERS cap pulled low. A moving van is parked in the driveway. KELVIN (cont'd) Thought only girls were moving in.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, look, Q.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's what my Moms said.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELVIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I hope he can ball.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAMAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Kid stops at the edge of Quincy's driveway.</context>
      <utterance>Bet he's a scrub.</utterance>
   <speaker>KID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey.</utterance>
   <speaker>KID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Can I play?</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You nice?</utterance>
   <speaker>KID</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Quincy looks the Kid up and down, then --</context>
      <utterance>Yeah, I'm nice.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Quincy tosses the Kid the ball. The Kid pulls off the baseball cap. Brown hair tumbles down, framing a soft brown face and bright eyes. She is MONICA WRIGHT, eleven years old.</context>
      <utterance>You and Kelvin gainst me and Jamal.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAMAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ah man, he is a girl.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Girls can't play no ball.</utterance>
   <speaker>MONICA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Quincy laughs derisively as Monica walks to the top of the driveway.</context>
      <utterance>Ball better than you.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Monica shoots him a glare.</context>
      <utterance>What a dog.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAMAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She heard you.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Monica starts to dribble. Jamal whistles as he walks backwards, guarding her. She throws up a shot. IT'S AN AIRBALL. Quincy and Jamal crack up. Kelvin rolls his eyes. Quincy grabs the rebound and shoots. Swish. QUINCY (cont'd) One, zip. He rolls the ball to Monica. She starts dribbling and again, Jamal just backs up with her. She passes to Kelvin. Jamal and Quincy collapse on him, leaving Monica open under the basket. Trapped Kelvin has no choice but to pass it back. Monica catches the ball and throws up a shot. It banks off the backboard...AND DROPS THROUGH THE NET. The boys look at her in shock. Monica tosses the ball back to Quincy.</context>
      <utterance>Nuh uh, they could only hear dog whistles.</utterance>
   <speaker>MONICA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>One, up.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Quincy easily dribbles by Kelvin and lays up the ball. He throws the ball back to Monica. QUINCY (cont'd) Two, one. Monica dribbles. Jamal plays her a little tighter. Monica bounces the ball through his open legs and lays up the ball.</context>
      <utterance>Lucky.</utterance>
   <speaker>MONICA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Quincy can't believe it. Kelvin cracks up.</context>
      <utterance>Two, up.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELVIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Aaah, she dogged you.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAMAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The game continues, with Quincy and Monica trading baskets for their teams. Quincy grows agitated with Jamal, who is unable to stop her. The score hits nine, nine. Quincy stands at the top of the driveway, ball in hand.</context>
      <utterance>Shut up.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Quincy dribbles through his legs, then pops an outside shot. The ball bounces on the rim...and rolls off. Quincy curses as Monica grabs the rebound and clears the ball. Jamal moves to guard her, but Quincy shoves him off. QUINCY (cont'd) I got her. Quincy defends. Monica smiles back at him.</context>
      <utterance>Point.</utterance>
   <speaker>MONICA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Told you I was nice. I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Monica suddenly passes to Kelvin, sprints for the basket. Quincy stumbles, giving her a step. Kelvin throws it back. Quincy knows he's beat as Monica goes for the winning lay-up. In desperation, he swings at her for the hard foul, shoving her off balance.</context>
      <utterance>I'ma be in the NBA. You're gonna be my cheerleader.</utterance>

   <speaker>GIRL'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>Her sister, LENA, 14, leans in the doorway, making a face. She is a mirror of their mother, with relaxed hair and painted nails. Her father, NATHAN, 39, moves behind Lena, holding a box.</context>
      <utterance>Eeew.</utterance>
   <speaker>NATHAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How are you feeling, munchkin? Monica nods. He smiles. NATHAN  Yeah, you're through.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAMILLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She needs to stop running around like a little boy.</utterance>
   <speaker>NATHAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She's alright.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAMILLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How is she alright looking the way she does?</utterance>
   <speaker>NATHAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He gives Monica a wink, crosses away. Monica pulls the washcloth away from her Mom and starts wiping the blood herself.</context>
      <utterance>Camille, she'll be fine.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAMILLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She exits. Lena shakes her head, follows. Monica pulls the washcloth from her face and stares into the mirror. TORN SKIN SURROUNDS A SMALL DEEP GASH IN HER CHEEK. Seeing her latest battle scar, there's only one thing left for this little girl to do. She smiles.</context>
      <utterance>I'll get some ice.</utterance>

<dialogue id="3" n_utterances="22">
   <speaker>ZEKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Quincy looks up, smiles. He quickly grabs a piece of crumpled paper, and tosses it to Zeke.</context>
      <utterance>Girl, who you trying to fool?</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nona intercepts his pass.</context>
      <utterance>Alley-oop, Dad.</utterance>
   <speaker>NONA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She points him back to his card. Quincy scowls, starts writing again. Nona scoops some frosting on her finger, holds it up. NONA (cont'd) New neighbors. Zeke wraps his lips around her finger, sucks the frosting off.</context>
      <utterance>Boy...</utterance>
   <speaker>ZEKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nona laughs, pulls him down for a kiss. Quincy suddenly throws down his pencil in frustration.</context>
      <utterance>See, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught me, with the old fake and bake. Had me thinking I was getting a sister who could burn.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zeke and Nona pull away, stare at Quincy in shock.</context>
      <utterance>I can't do this shit.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZEKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZEKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why not?</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZEKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's right.</utterance>
   <speaker>NONA</speaker>

      <utterance>Zeke.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZEKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit." Nona just shakes her head.</utterance>
   <speaker>NONA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We should head over.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZEKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Just you and Quincy, baby. I got a meeting.</utterance>
   <speaker>NONA</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>With who?</utterance>
   <speaker>ZEKE</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Business folks.</utterance>
   <speaker>NONA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You just got back from a four game road trip.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZEKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nona, don't start bitching. I got maybe two years left to play. I'm just trying to put some things together for us. Zeke grabs his keys. ZEKE  Later, Quincy.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zeke exits. Nona leans against the counter, concerned. QUINCY (cont'd) Mom?</context>
      <utterance>Later, Dad.</utterance>
   <speaker>NONA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

   <speaker>NONA</speaker>

      <context>Camille tries to smooth down Monica's unruly hair. Monica moves her head.</context>
      <utterance>Okay?</utterance>
   <speaker>CAMILLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, thanks again. This was really nice of you.</utterance>
   <speaker>NONA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Quincy looks up at his Mom, surprised. She quickly hugs his face into her stomach. Camille lights up.</context>
      <utterance>It was the least we could do. And I love to cook.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAMILLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, me too. I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.</utterance>

      <utterance>You're a caterer?</utterance>
   <speaker>CAMILLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Quincy snickers. Nona quickly changes the subject.</context>
      <utterance>Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.</utterance>
   <speaker>NONA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAMILLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Really? Well, come on, then. Camille hands Monica the cake. CAMILLE  Honey, put this in the kitchen.</utterance>
   <speaker>NONA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Camille and Nona head down the hall, leaving Monica and Quincy alone. The two just stand there. Quincy reaches out, scoops a finger of frosting, and pops it in his mouth. Beat, then Monica takes a bigger scoop.</context>
      <utterance>Help her, Quincy.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So...does it hurt?</utterance>
   <speaker>MONICA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's this big hole. You could almost see bone.</utterance>

      <utterance>One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.</utterance>

   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She don't know how to box, I bet. My dad showed me how to fight like Ali. He shows off a flurry of punches.</utterance>
   <speaker>MONICA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Monica puts the cake down on a box, does a couple of kicks and hand movements. Quincy is impressed.</context>
      <utterance>So, I know karate from "Almighty Isis."</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Quincy does a jump kick. Monica does the same. QUINCY (cont'd) Okay, how bout this? Quincy takes a couple steps back, then does a cartwheel. It looks great, until he crashes into the box with the cake. The cake falls onto his head and shoulder. Monica doubles over, laughing. Quincy is embarrassed. Camille and Nona rush back into the living room.</context>
      <utterance>Bet you can't do this though.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAMILLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>

      <context>Monica nods. Quincy takes the envelope, sits down on the grass. Monica sits down beside him. He tears open the envelope and pulls out the letter. Monica stares at him as he reads, trying to see an answer in his face. Quincy finally looks up. Expressionless. QUINCY (cont'd) Damn girl... Monica's face falls. And then, a slow smile spreads across Quincy's face. QUINCY (cont'd) They want you. Monica grabs the letter, reads. Her head just drops as a tidal wave of relief washes over her. Quincy smiles. QUINCY (cont'd) Congratulations. Monica looks up, cheesing. QUINCY (cont'd) I'm gonna be there, too. I'm announcing tomorrow.</context>

Monica stares at him, then to his surprise, she reaches over, gives his shirt a small tug with her finger. Quincy stares at her, then slowly pulls off his tie. He nervously unbuttons his shirt. He fumbles with the last two buttons. Monica slowly pulls down the straps of her dress, self- conscious. Quincy can't keep his eyes off her. He pulls off his pants. Monica glances down and her eyes widen. She looks scared to death. Quincy smiles softly, leans in and gently kisses her. She relaxes. They lay down. Quincy reaches into his pants for a condom. His hands shake as he puts it on. They stare at each other as he moves on top of her. Quincy pushes inside her. She flinches back in pain. Quincy immediately stops as tears spring to her eyes.</context>

      <context>Coach Miller pauses a moment to let her words sink in. Monica glances at her fellow freshman for their reactions. Like her, a lot of cockiness, a lot of fear. COACH MILLER (cont'd) A few simple rules. Eleven o'clock curfew, no exceptions. Always be on time, no exceptions. Attend every class, no exceptions. No drugs, no alcohol, no getting pregnant. And finally, respect yourselves, respect your coaches and respect your teammates, right Sidra? SIDRA, senior point guard, nods from the second row.</context>
      <utterance>I don't know some of you very well yet, and you don't know me because I'm still being nice to you. Laughter from the upperclassmen. COACH MILLER  But my philosophy is simple. Hard work and sacrifice. There's a lot of basketball history and pride here at USC, but just putting on the cardinal and gold doesn't make you a great player. Hard work and sacrifice makes you a great player. What you were doesn't matter anymore. For the first time in your life, you won't be the best. You'll be going up against women that are bigger and stronger and better than you ever imagined. So the question is, how will you respond? Well, your answer better be hard work and sacrifice because that's the only way you're gonna make it through. Vince Lombardi preached it and I teach it, "There is only one way to succeed at anything and that is to give everything."</utterance>

Sidra shoves her off and to the floor, and scores. No whistle. Women's pro ball is at a whole other level. Bigger, better, tougher. The ball is passed in to Monica. She drives down court, goes up for a lay up. An Italian player shoves Monica in mid-air, taking out her legs. Monica crashes on the hardwood. A whistle.

      <utterance>Yeah, four years ago. They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people. I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock. Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.

      <utterance>It's better. Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.</utterance>

      <context>Sidra laughs. They watch the madness out on the dance floor.</context>
      <utterance>Please, I went through the same drama as everybody else. I mean, the first four months, only person I could talk to was this chick Luisa, who knew like ten words of English from watching old "Dif'rent Strokes" reruns. Swear to God, I had to tell her if she said, "What you talking bout, Willis?" one more time, I was gonna kick her ass.</utterance>

      <context>Monica takes this in. Her eyes do not reflect someone on top of the world. She takes a long drink.</context>
      <utterance>Sometimes. But what's the alternative, not playing? You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore. I mean, look at us.

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal. All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table. And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas. And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is that really all you think of me? Monica can't answer. CAMILLE  When I married your father, all I wanted was a nice house with a big kitchen so I could start my catering business. And then I got pregnant with Lena, and then I got pregnant with you. And I put it out of my mind because that's what you did. Monica stares at her mother. CAMILLE  But you want to know what day I remember? In high school, you getting ready for the Spring Dance. I put my pearls around your neck, told you you were beautiful and you looked like you were going to cry. That day I was happy I didn't have a catering business to run off to. My family had three meals a day, had someone to pick up after them, and when my daughters went to a dance, I helped them get ready. That's what I came to care about.</utterance>
   <speaker>MONICA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's all you cared about. I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.</utterance>
   <speaker>CAMILLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You had your coaches and your father for that stuff. It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.</utterance>

      <context>Camille looks at her daughter and is struck by the need in her eyes. Monica moves off the barstool and leaves.</context>

      <utterance>You had a rough couple years, that's all.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?</utterance>
   <speaker>MONICA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And you tore up your knee. Rehab is tough.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nah. I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months. Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...</utterance>

   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him. Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.</utterance>
   <speaker>MONICA</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's a trip, you know? When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.</utterance>
   <speaker>QUINCY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <context>Quincy tosses the ball back. Monica drives. Quincy's knee is maybe at sixty percent and he can't keep up. She scores easily. She walks to the top of the driveway, tosses him the ball. MONICA (cont'd) One, zip. Check. Quincy rubs his scarred knee, then passes it back. The game continues. Monica owns the first five points easily by exploiting Quincy's injury. Monica drives for another lay-up. Quincy suddenly lets go of his fear, leaps and swats her shot. He grabs the rebound and lays it up. He nods intensely, as he grabs the ball and walks back to the top of the key.</context>

      <context>The game continues and now Quincy has the upper-hand, using his size and strength. He scores seven straight points. The score stays close. It is a sexually-charged battle of wills -- Quincy pulls off his sweat-soaked shirt. Their bodies collide as they wrestle for the ball. Monica yanks off her jersey in frustration. Her ass bumps into his hips as she backs him in. Her hands slide across his chest as she guards him... Finally, the score hits nine, nine. Monica slowly walks to the top of the key.</context>
      <utterance>One, five. Check.</utterance>

      <context>She tosses Quincy the ball. MONICA (cont'd) Check. Quincy tosses the ball back, drops low on defense. Monica fakes an outside shot and Quincy bites. Monica drives around him. SHE HAS A WIDE-OPEN LAY-UP. SHE PUTS IT UP..AND IT ROLLS OFF THE RIM. Monica can't believe it. Quincy grabs the loose ball and clears it. He stares at Monica as he dribbles in front of her. She stares back. He breaks for the basket. Monica stays with him. He goes up. Monica jumps, desperately tries to block his shot. Quincy dunks on her, knocking her to the ground. He lets go of the rim, and tumbles to the ground also. GAME OVER. Silence. Quincy stares at her. Monica looks back. Then:</context>
      <utterance>Nine, up. Point.</utterance>
