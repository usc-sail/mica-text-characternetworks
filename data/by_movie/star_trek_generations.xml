      <utterance>So, Captain... this is the first Starship Enterprise in thirty years without James T. Kirk in command. How do you feel about that? The Journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve. Kirk's eyes flash for a moment -- the longer he's on this Bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't feel good about it at all. He tries to shrug it off with a smile.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Kirk is shocked. For a long moment, he stares at her in amazement.</context>
      <utterance>It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. My father's told me some... interesting stories about you.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Let me show you the new inertial guidance system. Demora and Chekov move off and Kirk looks after them for a long beat. The expression on his face changes from shock to sadness... Something is clearly bothering him. Scotty moves over to Kirk, with a smile on his face.</context>

      <context>Before Kirk can react to this remark, an antique CLOCK on a shelf CHIMES as it strikes the hour. Kirk moves to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and wonder -- he is entranced by this experience, beginning to connect with things and memories from his past.</context>

      <context>Kirk moves to a drawer and opens it. Inside is a HORSESHOE with a tiny red bow tied to it. This confirms things for Kirk. He picks up the horseshoe.</context>

   <speaker>KIRK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Kirk is swept up in the moment, overwhelmed by memories, sensations, feelings. He goes back to the frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden burst of recognition.</context>

   <speaker>PICARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But Kirk's mind is clearly elsewhere... he's being swept away by the emotion of the moment... realizing the opportunity he suddenly has.</context>
      <utterance>I know how real this must seem to you, but it's not. This isn't Really your house. We've both been caught up in some sort of temporal nexus.</utterance>

      <utterance>Dill weed.</utterance>
   <speaker>KIRK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs. He cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins preparing a breakfast. Picard waits for a moment, then goes to the shelf, grabs the dill weed and hands it to Kirk.</context>
      <utterance>There's a bottle of dill weed on the second shelf to the left, right behind the nutmeg.</utterance>
   <speaker>PICARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>How long have you been here?</utterance>
   <speaker>KIRK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a breakfast tray. Picard is getting a little impatient, but stirs the eggs anyway.</context>
      <utterance>I don't know. I was on the Enterprise-B... in the deflector control room... keep stirring these, will you?</utterance>
   <speaker>KIRK</speaker>

   <speaker>PICARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But Picard's words mean almost nothing to Kirk. He is Thoroughly enjoying himself and Picard is almost a distraction. Kirk begins serving the eggs onto the plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the tray.</context>
