      <context>As she speaks, the camera pans across the court, panning down and stopping on the defendant: eleven year old Dade Murphy. Fast forward to the sentencing.</context>
      <utterance>The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls himself "Zero Cool", has repeatedly committed criminal acts of a malicious nature. This defendant possesses a superior intelligence, which he uses to a destructive and antisocial end. His computer virus crashed one thousand five hundred and seven computer systems, including Wall Street trading systems, single handedly causing a seven point drop in the New York Stock Market.</utterance>

      <utterance>Dade Murphy, I hereby fine your family forty-five thousand dollars...</utterance>
   <speaker>JUDGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Now Dade winces, in fact we almost expect him to cry. Opening credits roll to a backdrop of Dade and his family and lawyer fighting through a gaggle of journalists and photographers, in slow motion, and driving away.</context>
      <utterance>...and sentence you to probation, under which you are forbidden to own or operate a computer or touch tone telephone, until the day of your eighteenth birthday.</utterance>
