      <utterance>In the ensuing months, Kennedy clamps down on Cuban exile activities, closing training camps, restricting covert operations, prohibiting shipment of weapons out of the country. The covert arm of the CIA nevertheless continues its plan to assassinate Castor... In March '63, Kennedy announces drastic cuts in the defense budget. In November 1963, he orders the withdrawal by Christmas of the first 1000 troops of the 16,000 stationed in Vietnam. He tells several of his intimates that he will withdraw all Vietnam troops after the '64 election, saying to the Assistant Secretary of State, Roger Hilsman, "The Bay of Pigs has taught me one, not to trust generals or the CIA, and two, that if the American people do not want to use American troops to remove a Communist regime 90 miles from our coast, how can I ask them to use troops to remove a Communist regime 9,000 miles away?"... Finally, in August 1963, over the objections of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union sign a treaty banning nuclear bomb tests in the atmosphere, underwater and in space... Early that fateful summer, Kennedy speaks of his new vision at American University in Washington.</utterance>

      <utterance>What kind of peace do we seek? Not a pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war... We must re-examine our own attitudes towards the Soviet Union... If we cannot now end our differences at least we can help make the world safe for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal...</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>BACK TO a montage of the shooting. We see Kennedy, in the last seconds, waving, turning the corner at Houston from Main... We see TV footage and a piece of Zapruder film from before the shooting; fragmented images... CUT TO stages shots of crowd people looking on. The images are grainy to match the tone of the Zapruder film. People are on rooftops, hollering. The crowd is wild with enthusiasm. We pan past Jack Ruby and slam into him in black- and-white. The camera shows a Cuban man with a radio; a man with an umbrella; subliminals. Through open windows on the fifth floor of the Criminal Courts Building, convicts watch and holler from their jail cells. We see the sixth floor of the Texas Book Depository with open windows and a vague blur of a figure and a rifle. The clock on the Hertz sign reads 12:30.</context>

      <context>A motorcycle officer paralleling the Kennedy car tries to use his radio. It's jammed. The sound of the jammed Dictabelt drives the rest of the sequence.

Described as shy and introverted, he spent much of his childhood in New Orleans, Louisiana and went to high school there. After a stint in the Marines, he apparently became fascinated by Communism and in 1959 defected to the Soviet Union.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He married a Russian woman there, Frank, had a child, and then returned to the United States after 30 months. But he is still believed to be a dedicated Marxist and a fanatical supporter of Fidel Castro and ultra left wing causes. He spent last summer in New Orleans and was arrested in a brawl with anti-Castro Cuban exiles.</utterance>
   <speaker>FRANK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>These backyard photos were found yesterday among Oswald's possessions in the garage of Janet William's home in Riving, Texas, where Marina Oswald and her children are living. The picture apparently was taken earlier this year. Police say the rifle, a cheap World War II Italian- made Mannlicher-Carcano, was ordered from a Chicago mailing house and shipped to Oswald's alias A. Hidell at a post office box in March, 1963. This is the same rifle that was used to assassinate the President.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yes sir, traffic had been cut off into the area since about 10, but there were three cars came in during this time from around noon till the time of the shooting... the cars circled the parking lot, and left like they were checking the area, one of the drivers seemed to have something he was holding to his mouth... the last car came in about 7 to 10 minutes before the shooting, a white Chevrolet, 4-door Impala, muddy up to the windows.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOWERS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Inside the railroad tower, Bowers glances out, busy with the main board, flashing lights, a train coming in.</context>
      <utterance>Towards the underpass, I saw two men standing behind a picket fence... they were looking up towards Main and Houston and following the caravan as it came down. One of them was middle-aged, heavyset. The other man was younger, wearing a plaid shirt and jacket.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOWERS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We see the parking lot from Bower's point of view - at a distance, but we have a sense of the cars and see the men at a distance, tow uniformed men. The parking lot is bumper-to- bumper with a sea of cars. Rain that morning has muddied the lot. These brief images are elaborated on later.</context>
      <utterance>There were two other men on the eastern end of the parking lot. Each of 'me had uniforms.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOWERS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We feel the growing intensity: music, drums - but all blurred. We see a puff of smoke but no sound because of the window Bowers is glancing through. A motorcycle cop shoots up the Grassy Knoll incline. People run, blurring into a larger mosaic of confusion. Bowers is confused, seeing this. INTERCUT with Jim's heart pounding as he reads. Back in Dealey Plaza, S.M. Holland, an elderly signal supervisor, stands on the parapet of the railway.</context>
      <utterance>At the time of the shooting there seemed to be some commotion... I just am unable to describe - a flash of light or smoke or something which caused me to feel that something out of the ordinary had occurred there on the embankment...</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLLAND</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We see the scene from Holland's point of view - the puff of smoke lingering under the trees along the picket fence after the shooting.</context>
      <utterance>Four shots... a puff of smoke came from the trees... behind that picket fence... close to the little plaza - There's no doubt whatever in my mind.</utterance>

   <speaker>LOU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>FLASHBACK TO the exterior of the Banister Office on a day in 1963. The door is now clearly labelled "W. GUY BANISTER, INC. INVESTIGATORS." It opens and Banister comes out in slow motion, neatly dressed, rose in his lapel - the same office and same man we saw three years before when he pistol- whipped Jack Martin. Banister seems to be smiling right at us, greeting us.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah, Guy Banister. Ex-FBI man. He died couple years ago.</utterance>

Jim walks Ivon and</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bill studies the present sign: "Crescent City Dental Laboratory", and gives Jim a puzzled look.</context>
      <utterance>544 Camp Street. Same building as 531 Lafayette, right... but different address and different entrances both going to the same place - the offices on the second and third floors.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Lou gets it and glances up. We FLASHBACK TO the exterior of 544 Camp Street in 1963. Lee Oswald comes out the door into a full close-up, now clearly seen by us, and heads out into the street as Guy Banister intercepts him on the sidewalk, holding a leaflet and point to "544 Camp Street stamped on it. Guy seems miffed at Oswald, tells him something quickly, and then moves on.</context>

      <context>FLASHBACK to Canal Street in New Orleans on a summer day in 1963. Oswald, in a thin tie and white short-sleeved shirt, and wearing a homemade placard reading "Hands Off Cuba"; "Viva Fidel!", is hawking leaflets to pedestrians with two young helpers. A large white-haired businessman in a white suit, very distinguished, walks with a friend on Canal Street. Oswald glances at him and meets his eyes. The businessman enters an office building. This man is Clay Bertrand, later known as Clay Shaw. Some Cubans, led by Carols Bringuier, now appear. One of them, "the Bull", is heavy-set with dark glasses. More of him will also be seen.</context>
      <utterance>Bull's-eye. How do we know he was here? Cause this office address was stamped on the pro-Casto leaflets he was handing out in the summer of '63 down on Canal street. They were the same leaflets that were found in his garage in Dallas.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He was arrested that day for fighting with some anti-Castro Cubans... but actually he had contacted them a few days earlier as an ex-Marine trying to join the anti-Castro crusade. When they heard he was now pro-Castro, they paid him a visit.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLOS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Carlos throws Oswald's leaflets in the air and pulls off his glasses, prepared to fight. Oswald only smiles, and puts his arms down in an X of passivity.</context>
      <utterance>He's a traitor, this man! Don't believe a word he tells you!  You sonofabitch, you liar, you're a Communist, go back to Moscow.</utterance>
   <speaker>OSWALD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There is no real fight, but the police, as if pre-alerted, arrive. Arrests are made. We see Oswald in a room in the police station, talking with FBI Agent John Quigley. A calendar on the wall shows that it's August, 1963.</context>
      <utterance>Okay, Carlos, if you want to hit me, hit me.</utterance>

      <context>In a television studio in 1963, Oswald debates Carlos Bringuier with two moderators.</context>
      <utterance>There was no real fight and the arresting Lieutenant later said he felt it was a staged incident. In jail, Oswald asked to talk to Special Agent John Quigley of the FBI who showed up immediately. They have a private session. Oswald is released and Quigley destroys his notes from the interview.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But the arrest gets him a lot of publicity and as a result Oswald appears on a local TV debate that established his credentials as a Communist.</utterance>

      <context>FLASHBACK to Banister's office in 1963. There are Cubans in battle fatigues and combat boots; duffle bags are lying around. David Ferrie, in fatigues, directs the Cubans as they carry crates of ammunition and weapons into a back room. Martin observes from another desk.</context>
      <utterance>Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer. I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.

      <context>Still in 1963, we see the exterior of Banister's office. A dozen Cubans follow Ferrie downstairs into the street, and pile into several cars, duffels thrown in with them. Ferrie drives the lead car.</context>
      <utterance>Often? He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We see the cars cross the long Lake Pontchartrain Bridge and enter a remote guerrilla training camp. Bayou and jungle are all around.</context>

      <context>At the guerrilla training camp at Lake Pontchartrain in 1963, we see scenes of basic training - shooting, obstacle courses, callisthenics - led by Ferrie and other trainers. Scattered among the Cubans are several white American mercenaries. We catch a glimpse of Oswald and glimpses of several other men we will see again, in sprinklings.</context>
      <utterance>Sure. Everybody knew everybody. It was a network. They were working for the CIA - pilots, black operations guys, civilians, military - everybody in those days was running guns somewhere... Fort Jefferson, Bayou Bluff, Morgan City... McAllen, Texas was a big gun-running operation.</utterance>

      <context>It's night at the training camp. FBI agents race up in cars in the middle of the night, swarming over the camp, rounding up the trainees.</context>
      <utterance>Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain. Ferrie handled a lot of the training. There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba. A few Americans got trained, too. Nazi types. Mercenaries. But Ferrie was the craziest.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARTIN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We see FBI agents loading dynamite, bomb casings, arms 155mm artillery shells, etc. Back at the racetrack in 1966, Jim listens.</context>
      <utterance>Anyway, late summer the party ended. Kennedy didn't want another Bay of Pigs mess, so he ordered the FBI to shut down the camps and confiscate the napalm and the C-4. There were a buncha Cubans and a couple Americans arrested, only you didn't read about it in the papers. Just the weapons got mentioned... 'cause the first ones behind bars would've been Banister and Ferrie, but I think the G-men were just going through the motions for Washington. Their hearts were with their old FBI buddy Banister.</utterance>

      <context></context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Negative on his tax records. Classified. First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record. I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them. There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them. All classified as secret on the grounds of national security. It's real strange.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance. Three years later and he's still classified? They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald. Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17. He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate. He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick. He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow... FLASHBACK TO Moscow in 1959. We see shots of the city - strange and eerie black-and-white stills. Inside the U.S.</utterance>

      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Continuing the Moscow flashback, we see Oswald talking with a female journalist in his small room in the Hotel Metropole. Again he sounds robotic.</context>
      <utterance>One of the consuls, John McVickar, says Oswald's performance was not spontaneous - it seemed coached. Oswald gives an interview to a journalist.</utterance>

      <utterance>I will never return to the United States for any reason. It is a capitalist country, an exploitive, racist country. I am a Marxist since I was 15.

      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We see photos of the city of Minks, in Russia, Oswald with various friends and tourists, shots of Lee and Marina with a new baby.</context>
      <utterance>The Russians are skeptical - want to send him back. Maybe they suspect he's a spy. He supposedly slashes his wrists in a suicide attempt so that they're forced to keep him, and he disappears for six weeks, presumably with the KGB.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>

      <utterance>But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians. He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.</utterance>

      <context>We see documentary shots of the U2 on Russian soil... Francis Gary Powers... The Summit Conference canceled... Eisenhower and Khrushchev.</context>
      <utterance>It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them. The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets. Or fake secrets.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan. Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia. That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it. As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed. I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that. It gets weirder.</utterance>

      <utterance>You want facts, Bill? Okay. From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia. From '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald. All of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.</utterance>

      <utterance>None either. It's bizarre. It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out. Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63. A man who has defected once already. It's crazy.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>FLASHBACK TO a Forth Worth map factory. We see Oswald at work on photo mattes with a Minox spy camera. The camera shows close-ups of maps and then flashes to a hand in the photographic section. We see a close-up of Oswald's head in a photograph - the same headshot that will be superimposed on the Oswald photo - and a razor blade cutting mattes.</context>
      <utterance>Dammit, it doesn't add up! Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations! The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return. Only intelligence people can come and go like that.</utterance>

Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes. Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.</utterance>

      <context>FLASHBACK TO Fort Worth in 1963. In Oswald's cheap apartment, seven White Russians, including George de Mohrenschildt, a distinguished grey-haired man in his late fifties, are visiting Marina and Oswald, bringing old dresses, groceries, and toys and milk for the crying baby, whose cradle is two suitcases.</context>
      <utterance>Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>His closest friend is an oilman named George de Mohrenschildt who's about 35 years older than Oswald, who's only 23 and supposedly broke. De Mohrenschildt is a member of the Dallas Petroleum Club, speaks five languages and was in French Vichy Intelligence during the War. Also rumoured to have been a Nazi sympathizer and member of the "Solidarists", an international anti- Communist organization with many Eastern Europeans and ex-Nazis, many of them brought here by the CIA after the war, many of them involved in oil and munitions interests in Dallas and the Southwest. You figure it.</utterance>

      <utterance>This is the guy that keeps turning up in colonial countries and each time something strange happens. Coup d'etats, presidents overthrown. He shows up on a "walking tour" of Guatemala's Cuban invasion camps just before the Bay of Pigs invasion. If we don't know he's CIA, let's circle him very probable - Oswald's handler.</utterance>
   <speaker>OSWALD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>(laughs)</context>
      <utterance>I think he's made some mistakes on Cuba, but he's doing a pretty good job. If he succeeds, in my opinion, he'll be a great President. And a really attractive one too - open features, great head of hair...</utterance>

      <context>Anna Meller, one of the guests, glances at a copy of Das Kapital in a pile of books, and talks to another Russian man about it... Talking now to Lee and Marina are Janet and Bill Williams, a mid-American couple in their late twenties, freshly minted.</context>
      <utterance>The only Russian that suspects Oswald of still being a Communist is Anna Meller. But her Russian friend tells her "he's checked" with the local FBI and was told Oswald is all right.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.

   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We see Oswald and another man in the Texas School Book Depository in 1963. They are hauling and stacking school textbooks - an obviously lower-level job for Oswald after the map factory. We cut ahead to empty graphics of the sealed off area, the window site, the cafeteria.</context>
      <utterance>Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program. He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We see the interior of the Williams' home in Irving on a day in 1963.</context>
      <utterance>I wonder about the Williams'. Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44? No one knows. They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M. Who called? Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible." Who called? Why's the Bureau been tapping them?</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We see Marina and Oswald in bed at night in the Williams' house, in a tender scene. Oswald says goodbye to his child. TIME CUT TO Oswald living in a boarding house. It is at night, and he sits in his room alone. The housekeeper, Earlene Roberts, heavyset, white, in her 60's, comes in and asks him if he wants to watch some TV with her. He declines.</context>
      <utterance>His wife, Janet Williams, studied Russian in college and her father worked for the Agency for International Development, which works hand in hand with the CIA. She suddenly becomes Marina's best friend. Marina fights often with Lee about many things - his secrecy, the lack of money. She says Lee is not sexually adequate. Lee hits her on several occasions. Bill Williams' convenient separation from Janet allows Janet to invite Marina to move into her house in Irving. There Marina and Lee have a second daughter - while Lee, now 24, stores his belongings in Janet's garage and rents a small room in Dallas under an alias of "O.H. Lee".</utterance>

      <context>FLASHBACK TO Marina on TV, a different person from before.</context>

      <utterance>We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.</utterance>
   <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief. That's what you're saying!</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll go you one better! Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.</utterance>
   <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He had his palm print on the weapon.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We see blank faces around the table.</context>
      <utterance>It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing. It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue. There's no chain of evidence, Bill. And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository? One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy". Take it at face value. Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here. He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right? What's in a name, right? In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake. A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right? Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?</utterance>
   <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But why?</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>To frame him, obviously. You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill! They're not ordinary crooks.</utterance>
   <speaker>LOU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught. Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou. Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job. Lou, come alive. These things are not adding up.</utterance>
   <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss. Susie's stuff is colorful, but...</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Let's start making some assumptions about the man. Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one. Who found the evidence? Who set him up? Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.</utterance>

      <utterance>Is this off the record, Daddy-o?  In that case, let me sum it up for you real quick. If I answer that question you keep asking me, if I give you the name of the "Big Enchilada", y'know, then it's bon voyage, Deano - I mean like permanent. I mean like a bullet in my head. You dig? Does that help you see my problem a little better? You're a mouse fighting a gorilla. Kennedy's dead as that crab meat. The government's still breathing. You want to line up with a dead man?</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Andrews stands suddenly.</context>
      <utterance>Read my lips, Deano. Either you dance into the Grand Jury with the real identity of Clay Bertrand or your fat behind is going to the slammer. Do you dig me?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANDREWS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Andrews drops his pink napkin in the crabmeat and waddles out. Jim now feels closer to the truth than ever.</context>
      <utterance>You're just as crazy as your mama. Goes to show it's in the genes! Do you have any idea what you're getting into, my man? You think Jack Ruby just up and died of cancer in four weeks after he gets a retrial? That's some kinda new cancer - I'd say that's a "going out of business cancer". You got the right ta-ta, but the wrong ho-ho. The government's gonna jump all over your head, Jimbo, and go "cock-a-doodledoo!"</utterance>

      <context>FLASHBACK TO Dave Ferrie's apartment on a night in 1963. The place is filled messy bricabrac, including two dozen mouse cages for Ferrie's cancer experiments. Ferrie, Bertrand, O'Keefe, and four Cubans in battle fatigues are laughing and fooling around. Oswald is in a corner cleaning a .22 rifle with a scope on it. He looks different, unkempt, unshaven. A record player grinds out a speech in Spanish by Castro. Some other people are there as well - it's a beatnik scene: sandals, hanging out, only one woman. Ferrie is taking pictures throughout of the group horsing around, photographing Oswald.</context>
      <utterance>I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg. He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists. He's a butch John.

Triangulation of crossfire is the key. You get the diversionary shot gets the Secret Service looking one way - Boom! You get the kill shot. The crucial thing is one man has to be sacrificed, then in the commotion of the crowd the job gets done and the others fly out of the country to someplace with no extradition. I could do that myself. I could fly to Mexico, and then Brazil. Oswald listens, playing with his rifle. Bertrand suddenly turns cold, flashing a look at Ferrie.</utterance>

Fascism's coming back. I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country. I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway. People should know why that sumbitch was killed. 'Cause he was a Communist.

      <context>FLASHBACK TO the corridor of Silvia Odio's apartment in Dallas on a night in 1963. Oswald drags behind two Cubans - one is "the Bull", heavyset with a scar over his left eye, who we saw at the Canal Street incident, and the other, "the Indian", is quiet and cold. The men ring the doorbell and talk to a concerned Silvia as Oswald hangs back, watching, in the shadows. The men give her intimate information about her father, who is imprisoned in Cuba. The men chatter ad lib in Spanish.</context>
      <utterance>I'll go you one better, Lou. He shows up at Silvia Odio's, a Cuban lady in Dallas working in the anti- Castro underground - remember that name, a solid witness. The two Cubans introduce him as "Leon Oswald".</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We see a shot of Silvia on the phone in her apartment intercut with a shot of "the Bull" in a gas station phone booth, on a night in 1963.</context>
      <utterance>...the Cubans want Silvia, whose parents are political prisoners in Cuba, to help them raise money to assassinate Castro. Something about the men bothers her. She tells them she doesn't want anything to do with violence... about 48 hours later one of the Cubans calls her back...</utterance>
   <speaker>THE BULL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Silvia Odio is surprised to hear this information volunteered. "The Bull's" eyes are on "Oswaldo", outside the booth with "the Indian". They're hanging out, talking to a mystery man, an Anglo.</context>
      <utterance>This guy Leon Oswald's great, he's kinda nut... he told us we don't any guts, us Cubans, cause Kennedy should've been whacked after the Bay of Pigs, and some Cubans should've done that, it's easy to do, he says - you know he's a Marine, an expert shooter...</utterance>

      <utterance>It's like he's giving her information she doesn't even ask for. She's scared, doesn't see them again till she sees Oswald's picture in the paper. But the Warren Commission says she has bad eyesight because they have Oswald in Mexico at this time, trying to get back into Cuba. The Cubans think he's a double agent so they won't take him. The CIA has a camera outside the Cuban Embassy and says this is Oswald in Mexico.  You figure it.</utterance>

      <context>Susie picks up the famous Life magazine cover shot of Oswald holding a rifle in his backyard.</context>
      <utterance>The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist. They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match. I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door. If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...</utterance>

      <utterance>Oswald, who worked for Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, did know spy photography pretty well. I took this picture to two experts. Look at the way the shadows on the nose fall in a straight line like it's high noon. But the shadow here on the ground reads like late afternoon or early morning. It's not the same time. Also look at the crop marks across the chin. It seems like his head is pasted on somebody else's body implicating him with this rifle and gun.</utterance>

      <utterance>...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba. The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba? Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks. Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Goddamn! They put Oswald together from Day One! Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board. Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems. You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination. Does the real Oswald know he's been put together? Who knows. It doesn't matter, does it? He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>FLASHBACK TO Clay's Dauphine Street residence, in the Quarter, at night in 1962. The butler opens the door and O'Keefe is admitted to the townhouse. Shaw appears behind the butler.</context>
      <utterance>Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street. Do you recall that?</utterance>
   <speaker>SHAW</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Shaw uses a bell to summon the butler.</context>
      <utterance>Of course not. I don't know this man. Obviously then, I wouldn't have him to dinner. Incidentally, I do not live in an apartment. It's an 1860's house built by Gallier. I've restored it faithfully. You know I am quite an advocate of restoration. At Shaw's house, dinner is served at a long table by the black butler. The table is decorated by a sumptuous setting of silver and candelabra.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man. He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long. Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?</utterance>
   <speaker>SHAW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not at all. But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other. That is precisely the point of a long dining table. The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHAW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Willie O'Keefe and Clay Shaw leave the dining table.</context>
      <utterance>It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then. I call him Smedley. His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?</utterance>

      <utterance>I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you. But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion. You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.

   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Miller waits. Bill waits. Jim comes forward with his reply.</context>
      <utterance>Who are you, Mr. Miller?  You see that helmet over there?  I picked that up at the Dachau concentration camp when we liberated it in 1945. It was the most horrifying sight I've ever seen, Mr. Miller. Pyramids of decaying, stinking bones and skin one on top of the other. I don't enjoy looking at that swastika every day, Mr. Miller, but I keep it there to remind me of what can happen when a country turns from free democratic principles to Fascism, when a few madmen turn human beings into digits and millions sit in silence and do nothing about it.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Miller's entire demeanor tightens into a corkscrew of anger and danger.</context>
      <utterance>Mr. Miller, you and I have met under a great misunderstanding. I haven't the remotest interest in becoming a Federal Judge. And nothing is going to keep me from going ahead with my investigation of John Kennedy's murder.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bill has a strange reaction - a sudden exhalation of breath as if an entire house of cards were collapsing. He rises, but Miller goes first, leaving silently. Once he's gone, Bill turns wearily to Jim.</context>

      <utterance>Everything I'm going to tell you is classified top secret...  I was a soldier, Mr. Garrison. Two wars. I was one of those secret guys in the Pentagon that supplies the military hardware - the planes, bullets, rifles - for what we call "black operations" - "black ops", assassinations, coup d'etats, rigging elections, propoganda, psych warfare and so forth. World War II - Rumania, Greece, Yugoslavia, I helped take the Nazi intelligence apparatus out to help us fight the Communists. Italy '48 stealing elections, France '49 breaking strikes - we overthrew Quirino in the Philippines, Arbenz in Guatemala, Mossadegh in Iran. Vietnam in '54, Indonesia '58, Tibet '59 we got the Dalai Lama out - we were good, very good. Then we got into the Cuban thing. Not so good. Set up all the bases for the invasion supposed to take place in October '62. Khrushchev sent the missiles to resist the invasion, Kennedy refused to invade and we were standing out there with our dicks in the wind. Lot of pissed-off people, Mr. Garrison, you understand? I'll come to that later... I spent much of September '63 working on the Kennedy plan for getting all U.S. personnel out of Vietnam by the end of '65. This plan was one of the strongest and most important papers issued from the Kennedy White House. Our first 1,000 troops were ordered home for Christmas. Tensions were high. In November '63, one week after the murder of Vietnamese President Diem in Saigon, and two weeks before the assassination of our President... FLASHBACK TO the Pentagon offices in 1963.

      <context>We hear vague ad-lib mutterings on the soundtrack indicating a friendly atmosphere, and we see stock footage of a C-130 transport flying to Antarctica and ice floes on the surface of the sea. Then, at a New Zealand airport, we see X, in a uniform, at a newsstand reading of Kennedy's assassination. The banner headline of an "Extra" edition of The Christchurch Star screams out "KENNEDY SHOT DEAD."</context>
      <utterance>...a strange thing happened. I was sent by my superior officer, call him Y, to the South Pole as the military escort for a group of international VIP's. This trip had nothing to do with my nine years of work in Special Operations. It was sort of a "paid vacation".</utterance>
   <speaker>X</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Back at the Pentagon office, we see X returning and meeting Y. The atmosphere is cordial, but Y is slightly different from before - more harried, more nervous. He turns away to light a cigarette, he doesn't want the usual conversation.</context>
      <utterance>It wasn't until I was on my way back in New Zealand that I read of the President's murder. That was 2 in the afternoon the next day New Zealand time, but already the papers had the entire history of an unknown 24-year- old man, Oswald - a studio picture, detailed biographical data, Russian information - and were pretty sure of the fact he'd killed the President alone, although it took them four more hours to charge him with the murder in Texas. It felt as if, well, a cover story was being put out like we would in a black op.</utterance>

      <context>We see an outdoor shot of the Texas Army Headquarters on a day in 1963. Inside, on the same day, Col. Reich is on the phone, puzzled.</context>
      <utterance>Anyway, after I came back I asked myself why was I, the chief of special ops, selected to travel to the South Pole at that time to do a job that any number of others could have done? One of my routine duties if I had been in Washington would've been to arrange for additional security in Texas. The Secret Service is relatively small, and by custom the military will augment them. I checked it out when I got back and sure enough, I found out someone had told the 112th Military Intelligence Group at 4th Army Headquarters at Fort Sam Houston to "stand down" that day, over the protests of the unit Commander, a Colonel Reich...</utterance>

      <context>In Dealey Plaza, 1963, we see an Army intelligence man taking a shot with a Minolta camera.</context>
      <utterance>Now this is significant, because it is standard operating procedure, especially in a known hostile city like Dallas, to supplement the Secret Service. Even if we had not allowed the bubbletop to be removed from the limousine, we'd've put at least 100 to 200 agents on the sidewalks, without question! There'd already been several attempts on de Gaulle's life in France. Only a month before in Dallas UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson had been spit on and hit. We'd have arrived days ahead of time, studied the route, checked all the buildings... We never would've allowed all those wide-open empty windows overlooking Dealey... never... We would have had our own snipers covering the area. The moment a window went up they'd have been on the radio. We would've been watching the crowds - packages, rolled up newspapers, a coat over an arm, never would have let a man open an umbrella along the way - Never would've allowed that limousine to slow down to 10 miles per hour, much less take that unusual curve at Houston and Elm. You would have felt an Army presence in the streets that day, but none of this happened. It was a violation of the most basic protection codes we have. And it is the best indication of a massive plot in Dallas. Who could have best done that? People in my business, Mr. Garrison. People like my superior officer could've told Col. Reich, "Look - we have another unit coming from so and so providing security. You'll stand down." That day, in fact, there were some individual Army Intelligence people in Dallas and I'm still trying to figure out who and why. But they weren't protecting the client. One of them, by the way, was caught in the Book Depository after police sealed it off.</utterance>

      <utterance>Army Intell had a "Harvey Lee Oswald" on file, but all those files have been destroyed. Many strange things were happening that day, and Lee Harvey Oswald had nothing to do with them. We had the entire Cabinet on a trip to the Far East. We had a third of a combat division returning from Germany in the air above the United States at the time of the shooting, and at 12:34 P.M., the entire telephone system went dead in Washington for a solid hour, and on the plane back to Washington, word was radioed from the White House Situation Room to Lyndon Johnson that one individual performed the assassination. Does that sound like a bunch of coincidences to you, Mr. Garrison? Not for one moment. The cabinet was out of the country to get their perception out of the way. The troops were in the air for possible riot control. The phones didn't work to keep the wrong stories from spreading if anything went wrong with the plan. Nothing was left to chance. I bet you there were even backup teams and cars on the other side of the underpass in the event that Kennedy got through wounded. They would have moved in with vehicles like they did with de Gaulle. He could not be allowed to escape alive. The camera is on Jim, listening. This information is much</utterance>

      <utterance>I never though things were the same after that. Vietnam started for real. There was an air of, I don't know, make-believe in the Pentagon and the CIA. Those of us who'd been in secret ops since the beginning knew the Warren Commission was fiction, but there was something... deeper, uglier. And I knew Allen Dulles very well. I briefed him many a time in his house. He was also General Y's benefactor. But for the life of me I still can't figure out why Dulles was appointed to investigate Kennedy's death. The man who had fired him. I got out in '64. I retired from the U.S. Air Force.</utterance>

Oswald, Ruby, Cuba, Mafia, it keeps people guessing like a parlor game, but it prevents them from asking the most important question - Why? Why was Kennedy killed? Who benefitted? Who has the power to cover it up?... You know in '61 right after the Bay of Pigs - very few people know about this - I participated in drawing up National Security Action Memos 55, 56, and 57. These are crucial documents, classified top secret, but basically in them Kennedy instructs General Lemnitzer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, that from here on forward... FLASHBACK TO the Pentagon offices on a day in 1961. A document is moved by hand into Lemnitzer's office where we see a set of hands holding it while it's read.

This basically ended the reign of the CIA - "splintered it", as J.F.K. promised he would, into a "thousand pieces", - and now was ordering the military to help. This was unprecedented. I can't tell you the shock waves this sent along the corridors of power in Washington. This and, of course, firing Allen Dulles, Richard Bissell, and General Charles Cabell, all of them sacred cows of Intell since World War II. You got some very upset people here.</utterance>

And then back to Jim at Arlington Cemetery reliving it... only the enormity of past evil can prepare him to confront present evil. In a strange way, it reassures him.</context>
      <utterance>Kennedy's directives were never really implemented, because of bureaucratic resistance, but one of the results was that the Cuban operation was turned over to my department as "Operation Mongoose", which meant that people like my superior officer, General Y, took over the Cuban personnel that were being trained to invade Cuba - and the bases like the training camp at Pontchartrain in your home state that were closed down by Kennedy... and that's how the "black ops" people, people like General Y, ended up taking the rules of covert warfare they'd used abroad and brought'em into this country. Now they had the people, the equipment, bases and the motivation... check out an old CIA man, Bill Harvey - ran something called "Executive Action", which carried out foreign assassinations. Harvey was also involved with the fake defection program that got Oswald into Russia. Check out the Cabell brothers. Interesting links to this case.</utterance>

      <utterance>...don't underestimate the budget cuts Kennedy called for in March of '63 either - close to 52 military installations in 25 states, 21 overseas bases, you're talking big money. You know how many helicopters have been lost in Vietnam? About three thousand so far. Who makes them? Bell Helicopter. Who owns Bell? Bell was near bankruptcy when the First National Bank of Boston approached the CIA about developing the helicopter for Indochina usage. How 'bout the f-111 fighters? General Dynamics in Fort Worth. Who owns that? Find out the defense budget since the war began. $75 going on a hundred billion ... $200 billion'll be spent before it ends. In 1950 it was $13 billion. No war, no money. Sometimes I think the organizing principle of any society is for war. The authority of the state over it's people resides in it's war powers. Even Eisenhower - military hero of WWII - warned us about it: "beware the military - industrial complex", he said. Kennedy wanted to end the Cold War in his second term. He wanted to call of the moon race in favor of cooperation with the Soviets. He signed a treaty with the Soviets to ban nuclear testing, he refused to invade Cuba in '62, and he set out to withdraw from Vietnam. But that all ended on November 22, 1963.

He wasn't good-looking or nuthin', he didn't look like he had any money, and he was in a bad mood, so I didn't pay him much mind. Well, I might not remember a name, but I always remember a face. When I saw him tow weeks later on the television, I screamed, "Oh, my God - that's him! That's Jack's friend!" I knew right then it had something to do with the Mafia... Well, about a week later, after she told the newspapers she'd met this guy Lee with Jack, Jada disappears off the face of the Earth...</utterance>

      <context>The camera tightens on the picket fence.</context>
      <utterance>...yes, sir, right here on this spot. The shots came from near that wooden fence over there, near the overpass.</utterance>
   <speaker>PRICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>On the overpass near Dealey Plaza, S.M. Holland, a tan, elderly, leather-faced signal supervisor, points to the picket fence for Jim and Lou. His accent is thick and rural. We saw him before, briefly, when Jim was reading the Warren Report.</context>
      <utterance>I saw a man run from this spot and go behind the Book Depository - 30 minutes later I gave this information to the Sheriff.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLLAND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>FLASHBACK TO the restaged shooting. The smoke hangs under the trees. CUT TO Richard Dodd on the overpass. He's a cowboy type with a hat and an even thicker accent than Holland.</context>
      <utterance>I made it very clear to the Warren people one of the shots came from behind that picket fence. I heard the report and saw the smoke come out about 6 or 8 feet above the ground, right out from under those trees. There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind...</utterance>
   <speaker>DODD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...we, all four of us, all railroad men, standing here, seen about the same thing. The smoke came from behind the hedge - and a motorcycle policeman dropped his cycle in the street and run up the embankment... FLASHBACK to the motorcycle... BACK TO 1967. Jim and Lou walk with Dodd and Holland near the picket fence. We feel the emptiness of the area now and see the normal amount of traffic driving by.</utterance>
   <speaker>HOLLAND</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...we came around here to look for tracks. It rained that morning and we found a bunch of cigarette butts. Someone'd been standing about here... The camera shows the "spot" and Lou sighting.</utterance>
   <speaker>LOU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Later Jim and Lou stand on the south side of Elm Street in Dealey Plaza talking to Jean Hill, an attractive, 30-ish teacher. Her demeanor has a rock-solid Texas back-country conviction to it; she's a woman not easily frightened.</context>
      <utterance>This is a good spot, chief, for the head shot. Jim looks, reliving the moment.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEAN HILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We see a flash of the Moorman photograph - a blurry Polaroid with the President in the foreground and the picket fence in background. We will return to this photograph in more detail later.</context>

   <speaker>JEAN HILL</speaker>

      <context>FLASHBACK TO the day of the shooting. We hear the sound of shots and see the Grassy Knoll from Jean's point of view.</context>
      <utterance>I jumped out in the street and yelled, "Hey Mr. President, look over here, we wanna take your picture." He looked up and then shots rang out. Mary fell to the ground right away, shouting, "Get down, they're shooting, get down, they're shooting." I knew it but I was moving to get closer to him. The driver had stopped - I don't know what was wrong with that driver. And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw this flash of light, in the bushes and that last shot... just ripped his head off, I mean, blood, brains, just blew everything...</utterance>
   <speaker>JEAN HILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Blurry image - we're not at all sure what or who or if... but a seed is planted. We see smoke - the same smoke Bowers saw... then Jack Ruby in a brown coat running from the Book Depository toward the railroad tracks. Then we see Jean's view as she runs toward the Knoll along with others. there are yells, shouts, and general confusion.</context>
      <utterance>I looked up and saw smoke from the Knoll. And everything was frozen - seemed like people wasn't even breathing, like you're looking at a picture - except this one guy. I saw this one guy running from the Book Depository towards the railroad tracks. And that was the same man I saw on TV two days later shooting Oswald. That was Jack Ruby. No question about it.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEAN HILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>At the picket fence, we see blurry images of police officers, railroad workers, cigarette butts, buddy footprints, confusion...</context>
      <utterance>It was him I was chasing up the Grassy Knoll, thinking our guys had shot back and maybe we got one of them. I don't know what I would have done if I had caught him, but I knew something terrible had happened and somebody had to do something.</utterance>
   <speaker>JEAN HILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Two Secret Service types approach her suddenly, and one of them puts an arm on her shoulder.</context>

      <context>In a Parkland Hospital office in 1964, a lawyer interviews Jean Hill. A female stenographer takes notes.</context>
      <utterance>I was scared. It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera. I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.</utterance>

      <utterance>Between six and seven seconds.</utterance>
   <speaker>LOU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March. You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon. No way. The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance. Not one. And Oswald was at best a medium shot. The scope was defective on it, too. I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me. The guy couldn't do the shooting. Nobody could. And they sold this lemon to the American public.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou. We gotta get our hands on it.</utterance>

      <utterance>That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.</utterance>

      <context>The camera swings to the Grassy Knoll and the picket fence as seen from the sixth floor of the Depository.</context>
      <utterance>I asked myself the same thing. Common sense. Even if you miss the first shot, if he accelerates you still got him for a second shot. No... the only reason for waiting to get him on Elm is you got him in a triangulated crossfire. You got him on a flat low trajectory from the front at the fence there.</utterance>
   <speaker>LOU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The camera swings to the Daltex Building across the street.</context>

      <context>Jim pulls the dead trigger, reliving the moment through the scope on a passing car.</context>
      <utterance>One shooter. One spotter on a radio. Maybe three teams. I'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people. Hunters... patient. It takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "3-2-1... green!"  Or else "Abort! Abort!"</utterance>
   <speaker>LOU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jim swings the scope up to confront Main Street. Another car is in his sight. Too far.</context>
      <utterance>Main Street's over there - the original parade route on the way to the Trade Mart. Too far right? Impossible shot.</utterance>
   <speaker>LOU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Moving at a normal 25 mph, they knew the motorcade would have to slow to about 10 miles per hour to make this turn. That's where you get him. The camera swings to the Houston and Main intersection.</context>
      <utterance>So they changed the route to bring it this way.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>

   <speaker>LOU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Beats me. City officials. Secret Service. Dallas police. They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before. But they didn't bother running through Dealey. They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>General Charles Cabell. Deputy Director of the CIA. Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor". When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him? Our friend Clay Shaw.</utterance>

      <context>Lou walks to another window in the empty Book Depository where Oswald supposedly did his dirty deed and looks out over the plaza, with all its ghosts. Jim and Lou are two men - with only two men's power. A terrible aloneness pervades their minds.</context>

      <context>FLASHBACK TO 1963 - the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository - the same place Jim and Lou are now. Jim looks around and sees one shooter and one spotter with a lunchbox radio, in repairman clothes. Jim is watching. Neither of these men is Oswald. We hear the sounds of the motorcade below. The shooter pulls the trigger on the Carcano. A loud frightening sound snaps Jim back to the present.</context>
      <utterance>You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before. If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.</utterance>

      <utterance>...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement. No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs. I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain. But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw. He's...</utterance>

      <context>FLASHBACK TO Dallas FBI Office in 1963. Oswald is at the counter addressing the female receptionist.</context>
      <utterance>This is interesting - are you ready for this? Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination. It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.</utterance>

      <context>TIMECUT TO FBI James Hosty confronting his agitated superior, FBI Agent Shanklin in one of his cubicles.</context>
      <utterance>He left a note. Hosty told a Dallas newspaperman it was a warning to him to stop questioning Marina at their home when Oswald was not present. She was not a citizen, so possibly he was threatening to deport her back to Russia.</utterance>
   <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Hosty tore it up and flushed it down the toilet.

      <context>FLASHBACK TO Oswald, under arrest, meeting with Quigley.</context>
      <utterance>This is just speculation, people, but what if the note was describing the assassination attempt on J.F.K.?  Come on guys, think - that's the only reason to destroy it, because if it was any kind of threat, like Hosty said, they would've kept it 'cause it makes their case against the "angry lone nut" stronger! Remember the New Orleans meeting with Agent Quigley the day he got busted?</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...there again Quigley destroyed the notes of the meeting. I think we can raise the possibility that Oswald not only was an informant but that he may well have been the original source for the telex we have dated November 17 warning of the Kennedy assassination in Dallas on November</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie. You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people! We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here! What the hell do we really got? Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead. Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Shaw's our toehold, Bill. I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care. I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!</utterance>
   <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose! We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government. Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up. Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro. Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q. Citizen. So they close the book on J.F.K. It makes sense to me.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level. Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President? Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back? Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation? Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up? Could the Mob wreck the autopsy? Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude. Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules. This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well so do I, goddammit! So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too. But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth! It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey." While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies! Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz! And yours is, too!

      <utterance>And now, Jerry, here's Big Jim Garrison, District Attorney of New Orleans, Louisiana.</utterance>

      <utterance>Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?</utterance>

      <context>He reads from a script on the desk.</context>
      <utterance>I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry. Call me whatever you like.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHNSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He fixes his eyes on Jim, waiting for a reply. A weariness has set in on Jim. Once more into the slaughter.</context>
      <utterance>First we had your charge that the Cuban exiles killed the President, then the Mob, then you said the oil billionaires did it, then you said the Minutemen and the Ku Klux Klan collaborated to do it, now your latest theory seems to be that the CIA and the FBI and the Pentagon and the White House all combined in some elaborate conspiracy to kill John Kennedy. Let me ask you, is there anyone besides Lee Harvey Oswald who you think did not conspire to kill the President?</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The audience, loving it, cheers. Johnson looks at Jim blankly, and reads the next question on his list.</context>
      <utterance>How many hours do I have to answer that one? Well let's just say this, Jerry - I've stopped beating my wife.  Or maybe you should ask Lyndon Johnson. We know he has some answers.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHNSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.

   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry. It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.

      <context>He pulls out a large blowup of the Allen photo of the three hoboes and starts to hold it up in front of the camera.</context>
      <utterance>That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>It takes Johnson a few moments to realize what's happening. When he does, he lunges like a cobra for the photographs, pulling Jim's arm down so the pictures are out of the camera's view.</context>
      <utterance>These arrests were photographed minutes after the assassination, and were never shown to the American public. They show...</utterance>

      <utterance>Sure they do. The camera can pick this up.</utterance>
   <speaker>JOHNSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jim swings the picture up a third time, but the stage director gives a "cut" signal - finger across the throat - and the red light on the camera blinks off. The monitor shows another camera panning the audience.</context>
      <utterance>No, it can't!</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The director frantically gives Johnson the "cut" sign.</context>
      <utterance>Those men you just saw were arrested in Dallas minutes after the assassination. They were never seen again. No record of arrest, no fingerprint, no mugshot, nothing. They all got away.</utterance>

      <context>We see a shot of Robert Kennedy in Los Angeles with his supporters.</context>
      <utterance>Much is at stake tonight in California. Public opinion polls show Senator Robert Kennedy of New York leading Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota. Their anti-Vietnam War message is obviously striking a chord with the voters, and whoever wins tonight will certainly emerge as the favorite over Vice-President Humphrey to win the nomination in Chicago in August.

      <utterance>It's a means to an end. This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge.

      <utterance>Well, a very great actor has just given us a great performance, Your Honor, but we are nowhere closer to the truth. Let it be noted, my office is charging Clay Shaw with outright perjury on the fifteen answers he has given, not one word of this...</utterance>
   <speaker>JUDGE HAGGERTY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>CUT TO later in the trial. A movie screen has been installed for the jury. Jim paces dramatically, as if waiting, casting looks at the door. Members of the press pack the hot room, and a fan turns overhead.</context>
      <utterance>You're out of order, Jim Boy, now sit down. Strike those remarks!!</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Zapruder film (8mm) now rolls. We have seen pieces of it before in the opening of the film, but now we see it whole. It is crucial that this piece of film be repeated several times during the trial to drive home a point that is easily lost on casual viewing. The first viewing is silent except for the sound of the clanky projector. It lasts about 25 seconds, and then the lights come on. The jury is shaken. The judge is shaken. The people in the courtroom murmur. Even Clay Shaw is surprised at what he has seen. Jim says nothing, letting the truth of it sink in. Then:</context>
      <utterance>To prove their was a conspiracy involving Clay Shaw we must prove there was more than one man involved in the assassination. To do that, we must look at the Zapruder film, which my office has subpoenaed. The American public has not seen that film because it has been kept locked in a vault in the Time-Life Building in New York City for the last five years. There is a reason for that. Watch.</utterance>

      <context>Jim walks to a drawing of an overhead view of Dealey Plaza. On it are dots representing locations of the witnesses. He points to each portion. He pauses and looks out into the courtroom - Liz has entered accompanied by Jasper. Quietly she takes a seat. Jim is unbelieving at first, then very moved. He takes a beat, then:</context>
      <utterance>The magic bullet enters the President's back, headed downward at an angle of 17 degrees. It then moves upward in order to leave Kennedy's body from the front of his neck - his neck wound number two - where it waits 1.6 seconds, turns right and continues into Connally's body at the rear of his right armpit - wound number three. Then, the bullet heads downward at an angle of 27 degrees, shattering Connally's fifth rib and leaving from the right side of his chest - wounds four and five. The bullet continues downward and then enters Connally's right wrist - wound number six - shattering the radius bone. It then enters his left thigh - wound number seven - from which it later falls out and is found in almost "pristine" condition on a stretcher in a corridor of Parkland Hospital.  That's some bullet. Anyone who's been in combat can tell you never in the history of gunfire has there been a bullet like this.  The Army Wound Ballistics experts at Edgewood Arsenal fired some comparison bullets and not one of them looked anything like this one.  Take a look at CE 856, an identical bullet fired through the wrist of a human cadaver - just one of the bones smashed by the magic bullet. Yet the government says it can prove this with some fancy physics in a nuclear laboratory. Of course they can. Theoretical physics can prove an elephant can hang from a cliff with it's tail tied to a daisy, but use your eyes - your common sense -  Seven wounds, skin, bone. This single bullet explanation is the foundation of the Warren Commission's claim of a lone assassin. And once you conclude the magic bullet could not create all seven of those wounds, you have to conclude there was a fourth shot and a second rifleman. And if there was a second rifleman, there had to be a conspiracy, which we believe involved the accused Clay Shaw. Fifty-one witnesses, gentlemen of the jury, thought they heard shots coming from the Grassy Knoll, which is to the right and front of the President.</utterance>

      <utterance>...almost a fifth or perhaps a quarter of the back of the head - this area here...  ...had been blasted out along with the brain tissue there.

      <utterance>The three Bethesda Naval Hospital doctors picked by the Military left something to be desired inasmuch as none of them had experience with combat gunfire wounds.

      <context>FLASHBACK TO: the Book Depository, 1963. A shooter and two spotters dressed as working men move into the Oswald spot. One spotter produces the Mannlicher-Carcano.</context>
      <utterance>So what really happened that day? Let's just for a moment speculate, shall we? We have the epileptic seizure around 12:15 P.M.... distracting the police, making it easier for the shooters to move into their places. The epileptic later vanished, never checking into the hospital. The A Team gets on the 6th floor of the Book Depository...</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>The camera takes the shooter's point of view: we see down the street through a scope. His spotter wears a radio earpiece. The second spotter is working out of the southeast window.</context>
      <utterance>They were refurbishing the floors in the Depository that week, which allowed unknown workmen in and out of the building. The men move quickly into position just minutes before the shooting.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Inside the Dal-Tex Building, a shooter and a spotter dressed as air-conditioning men move into a small second-story textile storage room.</context>
      <utterance>The second spotter is probably calling all the shots on a radio to the two other teams. He as the best overall view - "the God spot".</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>At the picket fence a shooter in a Dallas Police uniform moves into place, aiming up Elm Street. His spotter has a radio to his ear. Another man in a Secret Service suit moves further down the fence.</context>
      <utterance>B Team - one rifleman and one spotter with a headset, with access to the building - moves into a low floor of the Dal-Tex Building.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Part of this team is a coordinator who's flashed security credentials at several people, chasing them out of the parking lot area. An "agent" in tie and suit moves on the underpass, keeping an eye out. In the crowd on Elm Street, we catch brief glimpses of the umbrella man and the Cuban, neither of them watching Kennedy, both looking around to their teams. There is a third man, heavyset, in a construction helmet.</context>
      <utterance>The third team, the C Team, moves in behind the picket fence above the Grassy Knoll, where the shooter and the spotter are first seen by the late Lee Bowers in the watchtower of the railyard. They have the best position of all. Kennedy is close and on a flat low trajectory.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>J.F.K. waves and turns in slow motion.</context>
      <utterance>Probably two to three more men are down in the crowd on Elm... ten to twelve men... three teams, three shooters. The triangulation of fire Clay Shaw and David Ferrie discussed two months before. They've walked the Plaza, they know every inch. They've calibrated their sights, practiced on moving targets. They're ready. It's going to be a turkey shoot. Kennedy's motorcade makes the turn from Main onto Houston.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>From Houston Street we look up at the sixth floor of the Book Depository and see the shooter moving around. Arnold Rowland points him out to his wife.</context>

   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>All the shooters tighten, taking aim. It's a tense moment.</context>
      <utterance>...they don't shoot him coming up Houston, which is the easiest shot for a single shooter in the Book Depository, but they wait till he gets to the killing zone between three rifles. Kennedy makes the final turn from Houston onto Elm, slowing down to some 11 miles per hour.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>The camera is on Kennedy waving. A MONTAGE follows - all the faces in the square that we've introduced in the movie now appear one after the other, watching - the killers, the man with the umbrella, the Newman family, Mary Moorman photographing, Jean Hill, Abraham Zapruder filming it, S.M. Holland, Patrolman Harkness... INTERCUT with the Zapruder and Nix films on J.F.K. in the final seconds coming abreast of the Stemmons Freeway sign.</context>
      <utterance>The shooters across Dealey Plaza tighten, taking their aim across their sights... waiting for the radio to say "Green Green!" or "Abort Abort!"</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>CUT TO the Dal-Tex shooter firing. We see the back of Kennedy's through his gun sight. Kennedy (stand in) reacts in the Zapruder film.</context>
      <utterance>The first shot rings out.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Everything goes off very fast now. Repeating intercuts are slowed down with shots of Kennedy reacting in the Zapruder film.</context>
      <utterance>Sounding like a backfire, it misses completely... Frame 161, Kennedy stops waving as he hears something. Connally turns his head slightly to the right.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>CUT TO: the picket fence shooter hitting him from the fence. We see Kennedy (stand in) from the point of view of his telescopic sight. In the Zapruder film, we see Kennedy clutch his throat.</context>
      <utterance>Frame 193 - the second shot hits Kennedy in the throat from the front. Frame 225 - the President emerging from the road sign. He obviously has been hit, raising his arms to his throat.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>CUT TO: the Dal-Tex shooter. We see Kennedy from his point of view, and the Zapruder film in slow motion.</context>
      <utterance>Frame 232, the third shot - the President has been hit in the back, drawing him downward and forward. Connally, you will notice, shows no signs at all of being hit. He is visibly holding his Stetson which is impossible if his wrist has been shattered.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>CUT TO: the sixth floor shooter firing rapidly and missing Kennedy but hitting Connally (stand in).</context>
      <utterance>Connally's turning now here. Frame 238... the fourth shot misses Kennedy and takes Connally in the back. This is the key shot that proves two rifles from the rear. This is 1.6 seconds after the third shot, and we know no manual bolt action rifle can be recycled in that time. Connally is hit, his mouth drops, he yells out, "My God, they're going to kill us all"... Here...</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>CUT TO: the umbrella man pumping his umbrella. The Cuban is looking off. The man on the curb in the construction helmet is looking not at J.F.K. but up at the Book Depository.</context>
      <utterance>...the umbrella man is signalling "He's not dead. Keep shooting." James Tague down at the underpass is hit sometime now by another shot that misses.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>CUT TO the picket fence shooter. We see J.F.K. from his point of view. He fires, and then we see Kennedy in the Zapruder film flying backwards and to his left in a ferocious, conclusive spray of blood and brain tissue. We repeat the shot.</context>
      <utterance>The car brakes. The fifth and fatal shot - frame 313 - takes Kennedy in the head from the front...</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Kennedy's car speeds off. Jackie is like a crawling animal in a pillbox hat on the back of the car. The people on the other side of the underpass wave innocently as the car speeds through with it's horrifying contents. Pigeons fly off the rooftop of the Book Depository.</context>
      <utterance>This is the key shot. Watch it again. The President going back to his left. Shot from the front and right. Totally inconsistent with the shot from the Depository. Again - ... back and two the left. ... back and to the left... back and to the left.</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>CUT TO: sixth floor spotter dumping the Mannlicher - Carcano in a corner as he leaves... and then to the Dal-Tex spotter and shooter, who break down the gun and move out... and then to the spotter with the fence shooter, who quickly breaks down the weapon, throwing it in the trunk of a car parked at the fence. He walks away. The fence shooter, dressed as a policeman, blends with the crowd. CUT TO: the umbrella man and the Cuban sitting quietly together on the north side of the curb of Elm Street. CUT TO: stunned, confused, people in the crowd - some lying on the ground, some running for the Grassy Knoll. Back in the courtroom, patrolman Joe Smith is on the stand.</context>
      <utterance>What happens then? Pandemonium. The shooters quickly disassemble their various weapons, all except the Oswald rifle.</utterance>

      <utterance>...the character produces credentials from his pocket which showed him to be Secret Service. So I accepted that and let him go and continued our search. But I regretted it, 'cause this guy looked like an auto mechanic. He had on a sports shirt and pants, but he had dirty fingernails. Afterwards it didn't ring true, but at the time we were so pressed for time.</utterance>

I remember it was 12:15 or later. It coulda been 12:25, five minutes before the assassination, I don't exactly remember. I was pregnant and I had a craving for a glass of water.</utterance>

      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>We see footage of J.F.K. coming up Houston - waving. Oswald walks into the second floor lunchroom as policeman Marrion Baker runs in, gun at his side. He is about 30 feet from Oswald. Roy Truly, the superintendent, runs in a moment later.</context>

      <utterance>Kennedy was running five minutes late for his appointment with death. He was due at 12:25. If Oswald was the assassin, he was certainly pretty non-chalant about getting himself into position. Later he told Dallas police he was standing in the second floor snackroom. Probably told to wait there for a phone call by his handler. The phones were in the adjacent and empty second floor offices, but the call never came. A maximum 90 seconds after Kennedy is shot, patrolman Marrion Baker runs into Oswald in that second story lunchroom.</utterance>

      <context>(as Baker moves on) The President's been shot! Oswald reacts as if hearing it for the first time. Truly and Baker continue running up the stairs. Oswald proceeds to get a Coke and continues out of the room. CUT TO: the sixth floor, where we see Oswald as the shooter. After firing, he runs full speed for the stairs, stashing the rifle on the other side of the loft. Our camera follows him roughly down stairs - we hear the loud sound of his shoes banging on the hollow wood - to the lunchroom, where Patrolman Baker and Superintendent Truly run in. Then they start to repeat the same action as seen in the previous scene.</context>

      <context>CUT TO: the second floor. Oswald ambles past Mrs. Reid, a secretary in the second floor office, on his way out, Coke bottle in hand and wearing his usual dreamy look... there's a lingering close - up on his face.</context>
      <utterance>...but what the Warren Report would have us believe is that after firing 3 bolt action shots in 5.6 seconds, Oswald then leaves three cartridges neatly side by side in the firing nest, wipes the rifle clear of fingerprints, stashes the rifle on the other side of the loft, sprints down five flights of stairs, past witnesses Victoria Adams and Sandra Styles who never see him, and then shows up cool and calm on the second floor in front of Patrolman Baker - all this within a maximum 90 seconds of the shooting. Is he out of breath? According to Baker, absolutely not.</utterance>

      <utterance>Assuming he is the sole assassin, Oswald is now free to escape from the building. The longer he delays, the more chance the building will be sealed by the police. Is he guilty? Does he walk out the nearest staircase? No, he buys a Coke and at a slow pace, spotted by Mrs. Reid in the second floor office, he strolls out the more distant front exit, where the cops start to gather... Outside, we see Oswald stroll out the door of the Book</utterance>

      <context>Back in the courtroom, Jim continues speaking:</context>
      <utterance>Oddly, considering three shots are supposed to have come from there, nobody seals the Depository for ten more minutes. Oswald slips out, as do several other employees. Of course, when he realized something had gone wrong and the President really had been shot, he knew there was a problem. He may even have known he was the patsy. An intuition maybe - the President killed in spite of his warning. The phone call that never came. Perhaps fear now came to Lee Oswald. He wasn't going to stand around for roll call.</utterance>

      <utterance>The story gets pretty confusing now - more twists in it than a watersnake. Richard Carr says he saw four men take off from the Book Depository in a Rambler that possibly belongs to Janet Williams. Deputy Roger Craig says two men picked up Oswald in the same Rambler a few minutes later. Other people say Oswald took a bus out of there, and then because he was stuck in traffic, he hopped a cab to his rooming house in Oak Cliff... FLASHBACK TO: Oswald's boarding house. Oswald enters his</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>...we must assume he wanted to get back in touch with his intell team, probably at a safehouse or at the Texas Theatre, but how could he be sure? He didn't know who to trust anymore...</utterance>
   <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>On a street, Oswald walks alone, fast. A police car pulls up alongside him on 10th Street. Oswald leans on the passenger side of the window. Officer Tippit, suspicious, gets out to question him. Oswald pulls his .38 revolver and shoots him down in the street with 5 shots.</context>
      <utterance>Oswald returns to this rooming house around 1 P.M., half hour after the assassination, puts on his jacket, grabs his .38 revolver, leaves at 1:04... Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper, says she heard two beeps on a car horn and two uniformed cops pulled up to the house while Oswald was in his room, like it was a signal or something... Officer Tippit is shot between 1:10 and 1:15 about a mile away. Though no one actually saw him walking or jogging, the Government says Oswald covered that distance. Incidentally, that walk, if he did it, is in a straight line toward Jack Ruby's house. Giving the government the benefit of the doubt, Oswald would have had to jog a mile in six to eleven minutes and commit the murder, then reverse direction and walk 3/5 of a mile to the Texas Theatre and arrive sometime before 1:30. That's some walking.</utterance>

      <context>Domingo Benavides, hidden in his truck only a few yards away, watches as another unidentified man (not seen before) shoots and walks away.</context>
      <utterance>It's also a useful conclusion. After all, why else would Oswald kill Officer Tippit, unless he just shot the President and feared arrest? Not one credible witness could identify Oswald as Tippit's killer.</utterance>

      <context>We see Acquilla Clemons, a black woman, looking on. She watches as two men kill Tippit. One of them resembles the fence shooter.

      <utterance>Acquilla Clemons saw the killer with another man and says they went off in separate directions. Mrs. Clemons was never taken to lineup or to the Warren Commission. Mr. Frank Wright, who saw the killer run away, stated flatly that the killer was not Lee Oswald. Oswald is found with a .38 revolver. Tippit is killed with a .38 automatic.

      <context>Outside the Texas Theatre Oswald walks past the cashier, who is out on the sidewalk watching the police cars go by. A double feature is playing - Cry of Battle with Van Heflin and War is Hell. He goes in. CUT TO: 30 officers arriving at the theatre in a fleet of patrol cars.</context>
      <utterance>Oswald is next seen by shoe salesman Johnny Brewer lurking along Jefferson Avenue. Oswald is scared. He begins to realize the full implications of this thing. He goes into the Texas Theatre, possibly his prearranged meeting point, but though he has $14 in his pocket, he does not buy the 75-cent ticket. Brewer has the cashier call the police.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>In response to the cashier's call, at least thirty officers in a fleet of patrol cars descend on the movie theatre. This has to be the most remarkable example of police intuition since the Reichstag fire. I don't buy it. They knew - someone knew - Oswald was going to be there. In fact, as early as 12:44, only 14 minutes after the assassination, the police radio put out a description matching Oswald's size and build. Brewer says the man was wearing a jacket, but the police say the man who shot Tippit left his jacket behind. Butch Burroughs, theatre manager, says Oswald bought some popcorn from him at the time of the Tippit slaying. Burroughs and witness Bernard Haire also said there was an Oswald look - alike taken from the theatre. Perhaps it was he who sneaked into the theatre just after</utterance>

That mindset allowed for 400 political murders in the Weimar Republic of 1923 - 32, where the courts were controlled and the guilty acquitted. Oswald must've felt like Josef K in Kafka's "The Trial". He was never told the reason of his arrest, he does not know the unseen forces ranging against him, he cries out his outrage in the police lineup just like Josef K excoriates the judge for not being told the charges against him. But the state is deaf. The quarry is caught. By the time he is brought from the theatre, a large crowd is waiting to scream at him.

      <utterance>The Official Legend is created and the media takes it from there. The glitter of official lies and the epic splendor of the thought-numbing funeral of J.F.K. confuse the eye and confound the understanding. Hitler always said "the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it." Lee Oswald - a crazed, lonely man who wanted attention and got it by killing a President, was only the first in a long line of patsies. In later years Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, men whose commitment to change and to peace would make them dangerous to men who are committed to war, would follow, also killed by such "lonely, crazed men," who remove our guilt by making murder a meaningless act of a loner. We have all become Hamlets in our country - children of a slain father - leader whose killers still possess the throne. The ghost of John F. Kennedy confronts us with the secret murder at the heart of the American dream. He forces on us the appalling questions: Of what is our Constitution made? What is our citizenship, and more, our lives worth? What is the future of a democracy where a President can be assassinated under conspicuously suspicious circumstances while the machinery of legal action scarcely trembles? How many political murders, disguised as heart attacks, cancer, suicides, airplane and car crashes, drug overdoses will occur before they are exposed for what they are?</utterance>

      <utterance>"Treason doth never prosper," wrote an English poet, "What's the reason? For if it prosper, none dare call it treason." The generals who sent Dreyfus to Devils Island were among the most honorable men in France, the men who killed Caesar were among the most honorable men in Rome. And the men who killed Kennedy, no doubt, were honorable men. I believe we have reached a time in our country, similar to what life must've been like under Hitler in the 30's, except we don't realize it because Fascism in our country takes the benign disguise of liberal democracy. There won't be such familiar signs as swastikas. We won't build Dachaus and Auschwitzes. We're not going to wake up one morning and suddenly find ourselves in gray uniforms goose - stepping off to work ... "Fascism will come," Huey Long once said. "in the name of anti-fascism" - it will come in the name of your security - they call it "National Security," it will come with the mass media manipulating a clever concentration camp of the mind. The super state will provide you tranquility above the truth, the super state will make you believe you are living in the best of all possible worlds, and in order to do so will rewrite history as it sees fit.

      <utterance>The American people have yet to see the Zapruder film. Why? The American people have yet to see the real photographs and X - rays of the autopsy. Why? There are hundreds of documents that could help prove this conspiracy. Why have they been withheld or burned by the Government? Each time my office or you the people have asked those questions, demanded crucial evidence, the answer from on high has been "national security." What kind of "national security" do we have when we have been robbed of our leaders? Who determines our "national security"? What "national security" permits the removal of fundamental power from the hands of the American people and validates the ascendancy of invisible government in the United States? That kind of "national security," gentlemen of the jury, is when it smells like it, feels like it, and looks like it, you call it what it is - it's Fascism! I submit to you that what took place on November 22, 1963 was a coup d'etat. Its most direct and tragic result was a reversal of President Kennedy's commitment to withdraw from Vietnam. War is the biggest business in America worth $80 billion a year. The President was murdered by a conspiracy planned in advance at the highest levels of the United States government and carried out by fanatical and disciplined Cold Warriors in the Pentagon and CIA's covert operations apparatus - among them Clay Shaw here before you. It was a public execution and it was covered up by like - minded individuals in the Dallas Police Department, the Secret Service, the FBI, and the White House - all the way up to and including J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson, whom I consider accomplices after the fact.</utterance>

      <context>He approaches the jury.</context>
      <utterance>There is a very simple way to determine if I am being paranoid here.  Let's ask the two men who have profited the most from the assassination - your former President Lyndon Baines Johnson and your new President, Richard Nixon - to release 51 CIA documents pertaining to Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby, or the secret CIA memo on Oswald's activities in Russia that was "destroyed" while being photocopied. All these documents are yours - the people's property - you pay for it, but because the government considers you children who might be too disturbed to face this reality, because you might lynch those involved, you cannot see these documents for another 75 years. I'm in my 40's, so I'll have shuffled off this mortal coil by then, but I'm already telling my 8 year - old son to keep himself physically fit so that one glorious September morning in 2038 he can walk into the National Archives and find out what the CIA and the FBI knew. They may even push it back then. It may become a generational affair, with questions passed down from father to son, mother to daughter, in the manner of the ancient runic bards. Someday somewhere, someone might find out the damned Truth. Or we might just build ourselves a new Government like the Declaration of Independence says we should do when the old one ain't working - maybe a little farther out West.</utterance>

      <context>having reached a verdict. Jim, prepared, sits with his staff and Liz. The jury foreman enters the courtroom.</context>
      <utterance>An American naturalist wrote, "a patriot must always be ready to defend his country against its government." Well, I'd hate to be in your shoes today. You have a lot to think about. Going back to when we were children, I think most of us in this courtroom thought that justice came into being automatically, that virtue was its own reward, that good would triumph over evil. But as we get older we know that this just isn't true. "The frontier is where a man faces a fact." Individual human beings have to create justice and this is not easy because truth often presents a threat to power and we have to fight power often at great risk to ourselves. People like Julia Ann Mercer, S.M. Holland, Lee Bowers, Jean Hill, and Willie O'Keefe have come forward and taken that risk.  I have here some $8000 in these letters sent to my office from all over the country - quarters, dimes, dollar bills from housewives, plumbers, car salesmen, teachers, invalids ... These are the people who cannot afford to send money but do, these are the ones who drive the cabs, who nurse in the hospitals, who see their kids go to Vietnam. Why? Because they care, because they want to know the truth - because they want their country back, because it belongs to us the people as long as the people got the guts to fight for what they believe in! The truth is the most important value we have because if the truth does not endure, if the Government murders truth, if you cannot respect the hearts of these people...  ...then this is no longer the country in which we were born in and this is not the country I want to die in... And this was never more true than for John F. Kennedy whose murder was probably the most terrible moment in the history of our country. You the people, you the jury system, in sitting in judgement on Clay Shaw, represent the hope of humanity against Government power. In discharging your duty, in bringing the first conviction in this house of cards against Clay Shaw, "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country." Do not forget your young President who forfeited his life. Show the world this is still a government of the people, for the people, and by the people.

      <context>In a White House office, Lyndon Johnson meets with a cabinet member, a contractor, and two military men.</context>
      <utterance>...and maybe a Vice-President getting separate memos from Vietnam, eager to get his backers the billions of dollars in contracts for Southeast Asia...</utterance>

      <context>The camera shows Washington, D.C. buildings from strange angles. The feeling is still, weird, angled, alien. The buildings are twisted.</context>
      <utterance>Kennedy, like Caesar, is surrounded with enemies. Something is underway but it has no face. Yet everyone in the loop knows...</utterance>

      <context>In a Pentagon office, a man in civilian clothing is on the phone, his back to the screen. This is Mr. Y, X's superior officer. Shadows pervade the room. An unshuttered window overlooks the Potomac River and the White House.</context>
      <utterance>Money is at stake. Big money. A hundred billion. The Kennedy brothers target voting districts for defense dollars. They give TFX fighter contracts only to the counties that are going to make a difference in '64. These people fight back. Their way. One day another call is made...</utterance>

      <utterance>Everything's cellurized. No one has said "he must die," there's been no vote, there's nothing on paper, there's no one to blame. It's as old as the Crucifixion: the Mafia firing squad, one blank, no one's guilty because everyone in the Power Structure who knows anything has a plausible deniability. There are no compromising connections except at the most secret point. But what's paramount is that it must succeed. No matter how many die, how much it costs, the perpetrators must be on the winning side and never subject to prosecution for anything by anyone. That is a coup d'etat.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>In the fall. Probably in the south. We want you to come up with a plan...</utterance>

      <utterance>He's done it before. Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro. No big deal. In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket. Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams. Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop? Part of the scenery. The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...don't think so. When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em. These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza! They took out the President of the United States! That's entertainment! And they served their country doing it.</utterance>

   <speaker>X</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA. Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...</utterance>

      <utterance>Ever ask him?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You never ask a spook a question. No point. He'll never give you a straight answer. General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.</utterance>

      <context>FLASHBACK TO: one of the hobo pictures. Next to the freight entrance of the Book Depository, Y, in a dark suit, is nonchalantly walking past the hoboes, his back to us. The camera closes in on Y.</context>
      <utterance>Does it matter? Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza. You know how I know?  That picture of yours. The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...</utterance>

      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I knew the man 20 years. That's him. The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring. What was he doing there? If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered. And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Just think... just think. What happened to our country .. to the world... because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...</utterance>

      <context>FLASHBACK TO: the White House, 1963. Johnson sits across the shadowed room with Lodge and others. His Texas drawl rises and falls. He signs something unseen.</context>
      <utterance>I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.</utterance>

      <utterance>Gentlemen, I want you to know I'm not going to let Vietnam go the way China did. I'm personally committed. I'm not going to take one soldier out of there 'til they know we mean business in Asia...  You just get me elected, and I'll give you your damned war.</utterance>
