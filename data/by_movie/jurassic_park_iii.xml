      <mode></mode>
      <context>Enrique heads toward the driver's seat and a large SECOND-HAND WINCH bolted to the deck.</context>
      <utterance>Don't worry. I take you close. But not too close.  You don't want them to eat you.</utterance>

      <context>Ben and Eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up. Ben lifts the camcorder to the record the action. Enrique jams the down the throttle down, and with a loud RAOR, the speedboat shoots forward. Soon the boat is whipping across the rolling ocean. Strapped together, Ben and Eric lean back over the passing water, intently watching for Enrique's signal. As the boat picks up speed, Enrique eyes the speedometer. Ben grabs the end of the RIPCORD attached to the harness. He and Eric braces themselves. Enrique finally signals with a pulling motion. He pulls the winch, Ben yanks the cord and - WOOOSH! A brightly colored PARASAIL blossoms behind the boat, hoisting Ben and Eric aloft. In a big BLOCK LETTERS on the parasail is stitched "DINO-SOAR." THE TOWNLINE unsold rapidly from its enormous reel. BEN AND ERIC climb higher and higher. ENRIQUE keeps an eye on the clients. When they reach a certain height, he LOCKS OFF the reel. High overhead, Ben and Eric are floating in wonderful, quiet splendor. The motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant. Down below, the boat enters a think blanket of FOG. Eric points excitedly at the islands as Ben films him with the camera. Then, a sudden TUG on the thing line cause Ben to drop the camera, which now dangles from his neck.</context>
      <utterance>Ready, amigos?</utterance>
   <speaker>ERIC</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A second tug...and now the faintest of screams. Ben and Eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared into the low bank of FOG. By the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist...THEIR IS NO SIGN OF ENRIQUE. The deck is splattered with blood. As Ben considers the driverless boat...</context>
      <utterance>What was that?</utterance>
   <speaker>ERIC</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something below. Following his gaze, Ben finds that their boat is only moments away from crashing into A LARGE REEF. Sticking out of the water, the imposing reef is being battered by waves. AS THE BOAT SMASHES INTO THE REEF, it splinters into a number of pieces. A panicked Ben turns to Eric.</context>
      <utterance>Ben!</utterance>
   <speaker>BEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Eric and Ben frantically unclip their lines. Catching an updraft, the parasailers float upward. A strong wind sends them wafting over the daunting cliffs of ISLA SORNA...</context>

And so he uses it again and again, producing different SOUNDS and variations. In the distance, flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off. Billy looks up to see a MAN and a WOMAN getting out of a Cadillac. Cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the tent. BILLY (cont'd) (falsely casual) Oh, I forgot to tell you.

Just now noticing the others' stare, Paul looks down into one of the bowls at his feet, a half-buried nest. It's filled with football-sized eggs, laid in a spiral. And this isn't the only nest.

They both stay completely silent. All this time, the sat-phone is RINGING. Than it stops. And after an agonizing beat, the beast moves. At first we're not sure which direction it's headed, but finally we can tell its moving away. Once the sail is finally out of sight, Eric breaks from Grant's hold and dashes to his parents' arms.

   <speaker>GRANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He points to a heavy crane assembly, designed for lifting cages off the large boats. Now well accustomed to fleeing on command, Amanda sends Eric up first, climbing the scaffolding like a jungle gym. All the while, they're trying to spot Paul. Grant is the last to climb, reaching the first section as Spinosaurus returns from the water, SLAMMING into the base of the crane. The whole assembly SHUDDERS, threatening to rip into the water.</context>
      <utterance>Up! Up!</utterance>
   <speaker>ERIC</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Where's Dad?</utterance>
   <speaker>AMANDA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Try as it might, the beast can't climb the crane. So instead it RAMS it, SHAKES it, trying to knock them off. Eric slips, but Amanda catches him. About to shed his bag to climb higher, Grant finds one last hope. It's the resonation chamber model. A beat before he decides: It may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice. He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before. On the third try, he's able to approximate the "egg" cry he heard the raptors give. He keeps it up, repeating over and over. Spinosaurus stops for a beat, confused How this sound could be coming from a non-raptor. But then keeps SMASHING. We can hear the mounting bolts STRAIN. Soon the whole crane will tip. But not before a MATCHING CRY is heard in the jungle. Grant stops, not certain he heard it. But there it is AGAIN. He keeps blowing. The crane is close to tipping when a single RAPTOR appears from the darkness, CHIRP-BARKING at the Spinosaur, who simply bats away. But then MORE RAPTORS come. And even MORE. Soon there are dozens gathering, circling. Grant stops signaling. All three survivors watch with horrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matter which side wins. Looking at his adversaries, Spinosaurus ROARS. And suddenly the raptors attack. Spinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants they just keep coming. They climb up his back, slicing, into him with their razor-sharp claws.</context>
      <utterance>Just hold on.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>All three drop from the crane arm into the water. Meanwhile, the fight continues. Spinosaurus rallies, shaking off many of the raptors, but they just keep coming. Their hooked claws dig in, scraping the meat to the bone. Spinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end, but finally collapses, dead. The raptors continue to shred it to ribbons. Then one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors swimming away. But a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It goes back to its meal.</context>
