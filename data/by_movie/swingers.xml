      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And what if I don't want to give up on her?</utterance>
   <speaker>ROB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You don't call.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But you said I shouldn't call if I</utterance>
   <speaker>wanted</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>to give up on her.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Right.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So I don't call either way.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Right.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So what's the difference?</utterance>
   <speaker>ROB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Right.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well that sucks.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It sucks.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Right...or more likely the opposite.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Right... Wait, what do you mean?</utterance>
   <speaker>ROB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call - whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Unless she comes back first.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>There's the rub.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROB</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>There's the rub.</utterance>

      <utterance>Hey man, don't sweat it.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Your advice really helps.</context>
      <utterance>...It's just that you've been there.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No problem.</utterance>

      <utterance>We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front</utterance>

   <speaker>MIKE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The dealer lays out the bills such that the amount is visible to the camera encased in the black glass globe overhead. Trent and Mike look up at it open-mouthed like turkeys in the rain.</context>
      <utterance>Oh... right.</utterance>
   <speaker>DEALER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mike's attention is recaptured by the dealer, but Trent continues trying to peer through the smoked glass.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>The dealer chirps out an unintelligible formality and the PIT BOSS chirps the response. Trent's focus whips away from the camera as both he and Mike stare at the pit boss ten feet away. The dealer plunks down the measly THREE CHIPS which represent Mike's entire cash reserve. Not quite the effect he had hoped for. The swingers stare at the chips. The players stare at the swingers. The dealer stares at the pit boss.</context>
      <utterance>Sure, that'll be fine.</utterance>

      <context>The dealer indicates a FIVE-DOLLAR TABLE across the room where an Hispanic woman deals to a BLUEHAIR, a BIKER, and a COUPLE in matching Siegfried and Roy T-shirts. The swingers look back to the dealer who is now flanked by the pit boss. The tense silence is broken by...</context>
      <utterance>Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.</utterance>

      <context>Trent looks over to see that it's the same WAITRESS who flashed him a smile earlier. At first he begins to smile, then, remembering that he is locked in a high stakes battle of wills, subtly shakes her off. She smirks and starts to leave until she is interrupted by Mike holding up a finger. It's a balsy move, but everyone's watching. The kid's going for broke.</context>

      <context>Mike throws a chip in the circle. Trent is shocked. That's a hundred bucks. Mike and Trent share a look. The dealer and the pit boss exchange glances.

      <context>Sue dives onto Trent. They wrestle a little too rambunctiously for indoors. Trent pulls the hockey sweater over Sue's head and starts wailing on his back. Mike crosses. The CAMERA follows him down a shallow hallway to the door. He unlocks it. A delivery man of eastern-hemispheric decent is out of breath from four flights of stairs. He hands Mike a twelve-pack of Bud cans and three packs of Marlboro reds. He can HEAR, but NOT SEE, the chaos ensuing in the living room.</context>

You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...</utterance>

The swingers are not happy with Sue at all. The two cliques contrast each other in every way. The bald guys all have facial hair and multiple pierced extremities with the odd neck-tattoo thrown in for good measure. Baggy denim and boots. Pot leaves and Pumas. Long, heavy key chains. Vintage 1994 whiteboy faux-gansta. They do, however, look big and mean next to our boys. The early sixties style sweater jackets and blazers over button down shirts and tapered slacks don't quite have the same fear factor, but the boys do look classy. The word "bitch" is growled out by the two of them a half dozen more times until... Sue pulls a PISTOL out of his belt. Everyone is SCARED. Especially the swingers.</context>

      <utterance>Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...

      <mode></mode>
      <context>... Up and over Hollywood Boulevard. High above the city...</context>
      <utterance>Hey Tom, Dick and Harry... Come in out of the rain... Those torches you carry... Must be drowned in champagne...</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>... It's all just a pool of beautiful golden light.</context>
      <utterance>Here's the last toast of the evening... Here's to those who still believe... All the losers will be winners... All the givers shall receive... Here's to trouble-free tomorrows... May your sorrows all be small... Here's to the losers... Bless them all.</utterance>
