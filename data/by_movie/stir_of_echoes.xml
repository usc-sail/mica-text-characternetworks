      <utterance>Well, I was walking in the night, and I saw nothing scary. For I have never been afraid of anything. Not very. I was deep within the woods when, suddenly, I spied them. I saw a pair of pale green pants with nobody inside them! I wasn't scared. But, yet, I stopped. What could those pants be there for? What could a pair of pants at night be standing in the air for?</utterance>

      <context>The hot engine of a Yellow Trans-Am fires up in the driveway of the house across the street. It backs into the street, its passenger door hanging open. The DRIVER honks the horn and a SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD KID runs out of another house and jumps into the moving vehicle. They take off. The Homeless Guy berates them, shaking his fist. They reach the steps of the house next door. PARTY NOISE comes from within, shadows move in the windows. Tom swings Maggie around, puts her on the step, wraps his arms around her, and kisses her. Great kiss. It goes on.</context>
      <utterance>Depends. How big you like `em?</utterance>

On the other side of tie room, Vivian and Beverly tell an animated two-part story to he teenage girl and the homey, finishing each others' se. .tences . NEIL (cont' d) Like any other part of our body, our brains have evolved a lot in a hundred thousand years. Our first thoughts were formless. Struggling consciousness. Sensation. An instinctive tie to our environment. But then our brains began to focus. We sacrificed the intuitions we first had so our thoughts could be directed, so we could master specific functions. That's where we are at the moment. We're brilliant with technique, but we've given up instinct. So the next evolutionary step, the step yet to come, or perhaps it's already in the making, is actually backward. To maintain our higher functions, but reawaken the part of our brain that was pure intuition. That was receptive to anything, because it didn't know enough not to believe. You're a freak of nature, pal, an evolutionary step. You're double- jointed. (taps his head) Up here.</context>

You're like a man in a dark tunnel with a flashlight, but the light only goes on once in a while. When it flickers on, you get a glimpse of something, but not enough of a glimpse to know what it is. Just enough to know it's there.</utterance>
