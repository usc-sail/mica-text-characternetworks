      <context>Elliot throws back his head and laughs. The crowd, wanting to be in on it, rise as one in a sustained CHEER! But a puddle of sweat caused by the dripping perspiration from Franklin's hands is causing the tip of his cane to slip. Elliot, ever aware, grips him tighter, averting disaster and finally they reach the podium. Franklin grabs one side of the podium while Elliot, with a sleight of hand Houdini would admire, LOCKS his father's braces, whisks the cane away, pulls his father's speech from his breast pocket and lays it smoothly on the podium. THE VIEW FROM BEHIND displays how Franklin's legs are spread wide for stability as he clutches the podium. He holds on tightly, as if the wood might snap from his grip. FROM OUT FRONT the crowd sees only a powerful man standing tall amidst the flashbulbs POPPING.</context>
