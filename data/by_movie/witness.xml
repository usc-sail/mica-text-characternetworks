      <utterance>I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>She takes a seat at the table, still shaking her head.</context>

   <speaker>RACHEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit. Rachel means no harm by this, but Elaine's eyes begin to storm.</utterance>
   <speaker>ELAINE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Rachel's smile fades at Elaine's trembling outburst:</context>
      <utterance>Oh, is that so?  No offense, lady, but I'm not so sure I like the idea of your coming in here and turning the place upside down!</utterance>
   <speaker>RACHEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Abruptly Elaine rises and snatches the mop from Rachel's hands. She mops furiously as she Continues:</context>
      <utterance>Please, I didn't mean...</utterance>
   <speaker>ELAINE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She finishes the floor, hurls the mop aside with a CLATTER:</context>
      <utterance>I know exactly what you meant! Listen, maybe I'm not a world-class housefrau, but maybe I don't have time to polish the goddamn china and keep after the kids!  It's none of your business, but I don't happen to have a man around here full time. So I sell cosmetics in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes I can even pay the rent on time! So maybe I'm not Mary Poppins, but maybe I don't need to have it jammed down my throat like this.</utterance>

      <context>Rachel is speechless, Elaine is on the point of bursting into tears. At which point Fred appears at the entry in his undershirt, taking in the sparkling kitchen.</context>

   <speaker>FRED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <context>Look, I shouldn't have blown my top. It's like... somehow... I've let everything get away from me. And you sort of made me face it. She takes the cup, sips the coffee. Rachel smiles at a private thought.</context>

      <utterance>Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.</utterance>

A pause, then Book explodes. The kid never knew what hit him or where it came from, he hits the road surface already unconscious. A second youth grabs Book from behind. A mistake. Book is smashing into him, spatters of blood from his nose flying in all directions. He's hitting too hard, too often. It's Schaeffer he's hitting. Hochstetler is pulling him away, Rachel is there too. A crowd is gathering, but as suddenly as it began it's over. Book shakes Hochstetler off him, straightens his hat, and in a kind of daze, begins walking past the scene in the direction of the Lapp farm. The youths are picking up their wounded, helping them back to their truck, aided by none other than Hochstetler. An OLD LOCAL addresses Rachel.</context>

      <context>Samuel looks at him, keeps on pulling. Schaeffer quickly crosses to him, grabs him by the back of the neck, tries to pull him off the bell rope. Samuel hangs on grimly. Schaeffer yanks hard, succeeds in yanking Samuel free, shoves him roughly aside. Then Schaeffer turns, FIRES a shotgun blast into the top of the bellrope. It still hangs by several threads, so he FIRES again. The rope drops to the ground. Schaeffer reloads, turns to look at Samuel, just getting to his feet. A moment... when Schaeffer, recognizing Samuel as the Amish kid who saw McElroy kill Zenovich, perhaps thinks of disposing of the witness right then and there. But a glance toward the oncoming Amish gives him pause. He SNARLS at Sam:</context>

      <context>Rachel stands aside as the old man embraces Samuel long and hard. She watches as he turns to the cupboard, takes down the big family Bible.

Rachel holds another beat as she stares at the old man helplessly, then she rushes to where she hid Book's gun, takes it down... her trembling hands take the bullets out of the coffee jar. She drops several as she tries to figure out how to open the chamber to load it. In the b.g., Eli glances up, sees what she is about... he rises and crosses to her. Samuel watches from the table.</context>

Eli leads her to the table, places her hands on the Bible beneath his. They stand there and they pray.</context>
