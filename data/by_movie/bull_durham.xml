      <context>PAN AWAY FROM THE SHRINE across the room. Late afternoon light spills into the room, across fine old furniture, to a small dressing table. A WOMAN applies make up. ANNIE SAVOY, mid 30's, touches up her face. Very pretty, knowing, outwardly confident. Words flow from her Southern lips with ease, but her view of the world crosses Southern, National and International borders. She's cosmic.</context>
      <utterance>I believe in the Church of Baseball.  I've tried all the major religions and most of the minor ones -- I've worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, trees, mushrooms, and Isadora Duncan...</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>

      <context>door. She chooses a pair of RED HIGH HEELS, with thin straps. She sits on a bench and</context>
      <utterance>I know things. For instance --  There are 108 beads in a Catholic rosary. And --  There are 108 stitches in a baseball.  When I learned that, I gave Jesus a chance.  But it just didn't work out between us. The Lord laid too much guilt on me. I prefer metaphysics to theology.  You see, there's no guilt in baseball... and it's never boring. ANNIE OPENS A CLOSET DOOR -- Dozens of shoes hang from the</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ANNIE SLIPS ON THE RED HIGH HEELS -- Smoothing her hands up her calves as she does.</context>
      <utterance>Which makes it like sex.  There's never been a ballplayer slept with me who didn't have the best year of his career.  Making love is like hitting a baseball -- you just got to relax and concentrate.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>SHE HOLDS OUR HER LEGS DISPLAYING THE HEELS, side by side. Like a little girl showing off her new shoes.</context>
      <utterance>Besides, I'd never sleep with a player hitting under .250 unless he had a lot of R.B.I.'s or was a great glove man up the middle.  A woman's got to have standards.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ANNIE STARTS PACKING A HUGE HANDBAG -- With fruit, an official scorebook, binoculars, a radar gun, and lipstick.</context>
      <utterance>The young players start off full of enthusiasm and energy but they don't realize that come July and August when the weather is hot it's hard to perform at your peak level.  The veterans pace themselves better. They finish stronger. They're great in September.  While I don't believe a woman needs a man to be fulfilled, I do confess an interest in finding the ultimate guy -- he'd have that youthful exuberance but the veteran's sense of timing...</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ANNIE TOUCHES PERFUME BEHIND HER EARS and, ever so slightly, in her cleavage.</context>
      <utterance>Y'see there's a certain amount of "life-wisdom" I give these boys.  I can expand their minds. Sometimes when I've got a ballplayer alone I'll just read Emily Dickinson or Walt Whitman to him. The guys are so sweet -- they always stay and listen.  Of course a guy will listen to anything if he thinks it's foreplay.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ANNIE POSES IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR -- She smoothes her dress along her hips. And puts on a flashy pair of sunglasses. Stylish and slightly mad.</context>
      <utterance>I make then feel confident. They make me feel safe. And pretty.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ANNIE STARTS FOR THE DOOR and grabs her baseball glove</context>
      <utterance>What I give them lasts a life-time. What they give me lasts 142 games. Sometimes it seems like a bad trade.  But bad trades are part of baseball -- who can forget Frank Robinson or Milt Pappas, for Godsakes!  It's a long season and you got to trust it.</utterance>

      <context>ANNIE SITS DOWN IN HER PRIVATE BOX SEAT -- Her chair is wiped off by a young black boy, JACKSON, 11, who then sits next to her. He is her employed errand runner, note sender, and friend. A GROUP OF GROUPIES ENTERS THE PARK -- 20 year old girl/women, dressed in tight pants, tight everything. Friendly, eager, innocent -- THEY WAVE TO ANNIE. FIVE PLAYERS' WIVES AND THREE SMALL CHILDREN sit in a special box seat behind a small sign "Players' Wives".</context>

EBBY is a great looking energetic man-child with the endless confidence, naivete and horniness of youth. Life is a party. A YOUNG WOMAN, MILLIE, 20, half nude, is dressing quickly.

      <utterance>I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5 -- born again before kindergarten... by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...</utterance>

      <utterance>pregnant, had an abortion, got pregnant again, had an abortion again... gave up men. Tried women. Missed men. My mother died.  I bought a car for $200 and drove to Ft. Lauderdale to bury her.  And after we'd sung some hymns in some wretched Florida funeral home, I went outside and something happened -- Her tone becomes wistful, nostalgic.</utterance>

      <utterance>Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody -- it was beautiful...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.</utterance>
