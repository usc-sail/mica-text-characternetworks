      <context>ANOTHER ANGLE, on them both as Dave blocks the aisle, an idiot false-toothed grin on his face. Hillyer has a pained embarrassed smile.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hillyer gives a barely perceptible wince at this speech, but Dave doesn't notice, he goes on with aggressive self satisfaction after a swallow of whiskey.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York. But the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Dave pauses, realizes this might not impress; glances down with curiosity at the galley sheets, then an unpleasant smile.</context>
      <utterance>But I have done real good in the construction field. What I don't know about buildin' ain't worth knowin'. I knocked off twenty-eight thousand smackeroos last year, how's that for an old country boy?</utterance>

      <utterance>Galley what?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Page proof of a book I'm working on.</utterance>

      <utterance>Oh, yeah?</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Willcox Hillyer listens with a pained half smile, a hand at his temple.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us another drink!  Dumb little bitch, supposed to give us two in the first place.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Willcox Hillyer half closes his eyes in weariness, but says nothing. Gently, he rubs his temple. It is plain Dave Wilkie gives him a headache.</context>
      <utterance>This friggin' airline's out of its mind.  The sons of bitches tried to put me in tourist.  But our whole civilization is screwed up, Buddy. The heebies and the coconuts have took it over and ruined it.</utterance>

      <utterance>She has other things to do, Dave.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The stewardess purses her lips at Dave, who is bowed over his drink busy opening it. Hillyer lifts an eyebrow at the girl as if to say, "Don't blame me because of this damned idiot," and she half smiles at him.</context>
      <utterance>Supposed to get two drinks in the first place. This friggin' airline can't do nothin' right.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I see. Outside it.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This is another pointed bitter reference to the unknown "she." Once again, Willcox Hillyer is deliberately unresponsive.</context>
      <utterance>That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Um-m, well...</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, no, I didn't actually.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Dave Wilkie's eyes narrow with vindictive anger as he says it and one can well believe the streak of raw violence in the man. It is frightening even now; he is a clown, but he is a dangerous clown. As his long, bitter, impassioned tirade continues, Willcox Hillyer becomes increasingly tense and pale -- it is obvious he detests what the man is saying and he is struggling to control himself. Dave's tone and voice are laconically Southern, but the hatred and misery in his eyes are raw.</context>
      <utterance>She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Remember that, Buddy?</context>
      <utterance>She used to call me Mr. Right.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Willcox picks up galley sheets, half turns away.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah, I remember it.</utterance>
   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>During this speech, Willcox Hillyer grits his teeth but says nothing. He keeps his eyes down on the galley sheets. As Dave shakes his head in sorrow at the state of the nation ..</context>
      <utterance>Well, I tell you, I don't know what the world's come to these days. Things used to be better. We didn't have any money, but things were better.  Goddamn niggers and kikes burning the flag, rioting, raising hell -- they ought to shoot their asses off. I tell you, Buddy, where this country made its mistake was allowing people without property to vote.</utterance>

      <context>Hillyer takes rental car papers from a pretty young HERTZ GIRL, gives the girl a little smile, picks up his travel bag. In desperation, Dave takes his arm.</context>

   <speaker>DAVE WILKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Hillyer turns to Dave, puzzled and interested; Dave earnestly explains.</context>
      <utterance>Buddy, I'm a sick man. I had a heart attack last year, I wasn't expected to live.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.</utterance>

      <context>Willcox Hillyer and the pretty young Hertz Girl stare after Dave Wilkie as he walks away with spasm-like steps. Hillyer seems affected, less hostile toward Dave now. He speaks half to himself, half to the Hertz Girl.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me.  Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane.</utterance>

   <speaker>ROSE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Silence. The damn boy says nothing. A trifle crestfallen, Rose moistens his lips and swallows. She ventures another little smile and the CAMERA follows her as she walks up the steps. The at-times-insufferable Buddy comes into the shot. He still has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his expression is inscrutable, neither friendly nor hostile.</context>
      <utterance>Hello. I'm Rose, and I've come to live with you and your family.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROSE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Finally, the boy speaks -- and he is not so bad. He's a child after all.</context>

   <speaker>BUDDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROSE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?</utterance>
   <speaker>BUDDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A warm and beautiful smile comes on Rose's face and a little twinkle comes into her eyes. The innocence and sweetness are not lost, that is never lost, but this is a girl who likes boys and men.</context>

   <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?</utterance>
   <speaker>BUDDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mother accepts her son's precocious pronouncement as perfectly normal; talks to him as if he's an adult.</context>
      <utterance>She talks a great deal and smiles a lot. She's very pretty, she has a real good figure. She's very girlish or womanish, if you know what I mean. She wouldn't hurt anybody, this girl. She couldn't.</utterance>
   <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.</utterance>
   <speaker>BUDDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?</utterance>
   <speaker>BUDDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.</utterance>

   <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.</utterance>
   <speaker>WASKI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You can stop it right now.</utterance>
   <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.</utterance>
   <speaker>WASKI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, Mother, cut it out.</utterance>
   <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can be a naughty angel sometimes, although her father won't believe it. Her real name is Frances, but we call her Dolly or Doll.</utterance>
   <speaker>DOLL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.</utterance>
   <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>staring at her with lips apart and blue eyes slightly popped.</context>
      <utterance>Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose? Rose has not as yet caught on to Mother's style and is</utterance>
   <speaker>ROSE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, no, ma'am.</utterance>
   <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Thus, Mother. Slightly cuckoo, a bit out of touch with reality, but no fool. A very intelligent woman really, and very, very gentle and kind. Her style, however, takes a little getting used to and her long speech throws Rose completely. She stares at Mother in speechless open-mouthed awe, unable to say a word. The CAMERA moves in CLOSER on Rose as she moistens her lips, swallows, tries to talk and can't. She is very, very nervous. Now she flinches and looks around as we hear a deep masculine VOICE OVER the shot. It is the voice of DADDY, Mr. Hillyer, Buddy's father.</context>
      <utterance>Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy in the doorway of the living room. He is a handsome man of about forty with a style and a manner all his own. As extravagant as his remarks often are and funny though he is at times, the man has a courtly Southern dignity that is never lost. He is no clown, he is not even a comedian, he is a man and a formidable man at that: all the characters in this story love and fear him. We see now where Buddy got his unreadable expression thing and his hands on the hips thing. Daddy is unreadable. A straw hat is on the back of his head, a rolled-up Glenville Tribune is in his hand, his hands are on his hips. He is staring with what seems to be stern fierceness at them all, but his attitude really is inscrutable.</context>
      <utterance>Honey, you'll scare the gizzard out of the girl going into the fourth dimension like that.</utterance>
   <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Daddy walks in as Rose stares wide-eyed at him. It is obvious he scares the absolute bejesus out of her, she looks actually as if she might faint, her hands trembling on her lap and her knees quivering beneath her cheap and tacky dress. But she has a surprise coming. She is soon to lose all her fear of him, every bit of it. Daddy walks over and sits in a chair beside her, stares fiercely at her for a moment, then begins a long speech. Again, extravagant as this speech is, he is no clown, he is not "being funny," he means every word he says.</context>
      <utterance>Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Rose can barely answer, eyes fixed in rapt fascination on him, a half whisper.</context>
      <utterance>Well, Rosebud, now you are here, darling, and I swear to God graceful as the capital letter S. You will adorn our house, Rosebud, you will give a glow and a shine to these old walls. If there's one thing I like to have around, it's a frizzy-haired blonde. Now I assume Mrs. Hillyer and the children have introduced themselves and made your acquaintance, and so forth and so on?</utterance>
   <speaker>ROSE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, sir.</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?</utterance>

      <utterance>Now, I know you've had some troubles in your life, those... scoundrels in Birmingham and so forth trying to... lead you astray. I hope you find a safe haven here, honey, I know you've had a hard time. Life can be cruel to a young girl all alone. We welcome you to our home, Rosebud, we all welcome you from the heart and hope you are happy here.</utterance>

I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault.

I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...</utterance>

      <context>... my, you're... looking pretty... CUT TO a shot of Rose in the doorway of the kitchen. She is quite an apparition. She wears bright red lipstick, pink rouge on her cheeks, mascara and her hair is coiffed up in some outlandish manner, but her clothes are the most remarkable thing of all. The skirt is of strange, pink, semi-shiny and very thin material and has about a dozen tiny little flowers that could be rosebuds sewed on it. It fits extremely snugly to say the least. The blouse seems a composite: it has frilly white sleeves that are opaque and otherwise is made of filmy white material that is hardly opaque at all. She has no bra and her breasts are half visible, the nipples denting the material. It is pretty wild for 1935. She seems to have on no underwear of any kind; the skirt, which clings to her like a bathing suit, shows no panty seams. She is carrying a shiny black patent leather pocketbook and has on high heel black patent leather shoes and no stockings. An ingenuous little smile is on her face.</context>

      <utterance>First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What sad news? Did her cancer come back?</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, no, no, she got all over that.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is her husband sick or something?</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>ANOTHER ANGLE on Willcox Hillyer and the aged Daddy as they sit on the patio sipping whisky. Willcox Hillyer is not disturbed or worried about Rose, Daddy has been very casual and offhand about it and he has no inkling of what the news really is.</context>
      <utterance>No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He didn't lose her, he threw her away.</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's what she would say herself.</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A wonderful woman, boy.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, son, she is dead.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Willcox Hillyer rises with his drink in hand and walks across the patio to the kitchen door.</context>
      <utterance>Excuse me, I'll be right back.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.</utterance>
   <speaker>WILLCOX HILLYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Daddy pauses, in trouble emotionally, but gets a grip on himself and in an almost dispassionate manner; but powerful feeling is behind his words.</context>
      <utterance>It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>CUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer. Despite his efforts to control himself, tears are in his eyes. He clenches his teeth, takes a big swallow of his drink. ANOTHER ANGLE on them both as Daddy rises.</context>
      <utterance>She got cancer of the breast, was operated on and had a seven-year recovery, then after a brief illness passed on in her sleep, as the man with whom she'd lived in beautiful love and harmony for twenty-five years held her hand. That is what happened, son, and God rest her lovely soul!</utterance>
   <speaker>DADDY</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And now, if you are through with that Yankee whisky, we'll go to the Holiday Inn and get some dinner.</utterance>
