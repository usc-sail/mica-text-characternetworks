      <utterance>I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.</utterance>

      <utterance>Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.</utterance>

      <context>Horner sits behind the wheel. Lillian silently stares Wade up and down, gets in the car beside Jill. The automatic locks latch as the Audi drives away. Its taillights merge with vanishing traffic. Wade looks down, picks up Horner's dark green Tyrolean hat, examines it, as if unsure of its function. Wade walks toward Town Hall.

      <utterance>Which is?</utterance>

   <speaker>WADE</speaker>

      <utterance>Then who shot him?</utterance>
   <speaker>ROLFE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.</utterance>
   <speaker>WADE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Motive. You gotta have a motive.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROLFE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Money.</utterance>
   <speaker>WADE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROLFE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?</utterance>
   <speaker>WADE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't know. You tell me.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROLFE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?</utterance>
   <speaker>WADE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?</utterance>
   <speaker>ROLFE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.</utterance>
   <speaker>WADE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.</utterance>
   <speaker>ROLFE</speaker>

      <utterance>A hunting accident is perfect.</utterance>
   <speaker>WADE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The truck sputters, stops. Wade pulls the keys.</context>
      <utterance>Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?</utterance>

Headlights glow under water, then go out. "Our Business Is Going In The Hole." Wade, alone in darkness, plops into the water, paddles to shore. Freezing, he finds Jack's tire tracks in the snow. He bangs his jaw.</context>

Prying his mouth open, Wade Whitehouse locks the pliers onto a large molar in the back, squeezes and pulls. He steadies himself, pulls again, yanking the pliers from his mouth. The bloody rotted tooth clatters in the sink. He takes another bite of whisky. Rolfe's voice plays over:</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Margie, watching him, quivers, starts to cry. She drops her suitcase, out of nowhere bawling like a baby. Wade goes over, puts his arms around her, pats her back. His face is racked. He, too, seems about to cry -- if he could. In his arms Margie feels trapped, overwhelmed by Wade's circumstances and terrible sadness. She pushes:</context>

      <context>Wade moves back like a bear, covering his face and arms. Jill, near hysterical, keeps after him, arms and fists flying. Wade stumbles backwards into the snow. Jill still swings. Margie dashes to intervene as Wade swings his arms wide. Jill flies into Marg. Her nose is bleeding. Wade's caught her across the mouth and nose. She takes cover behind Margie, crying. Margie and Jill stand side by side, saying nothing. Wade looks up stunned, as if hit by a rock. Marg slowly backs away, her arms behind her holding Jill.</context>

      <context>She closes the front door, starts the car. She backs out the drive. In her rear view mirror she sees the image of Wade receding, standing frozen, staring down at the snow. Pop emerges from the house, looks at his son, grinning. Wade looks at his old man, that dumb devilish grin plastered on his father's face. Glen Whitehouse holds an empty whiskey bottle like a pistol. Hunters' gunshots echo in the distance.</context>

      <utterance>We want to believe Wade died, died that same November, froze to death on a bench or a sidewalk. You cannot understand how a man, a normal man, a man like you and me, could do such a terrible thing. Unless the police happen to arrest a vagrant who turns out to be Wade Whitehouse -- or maybe he won't be a vagrant; maybe he will have turned himself into one of those faceless fellows working at the video store and lives in a town-house apartment at the edge of town until his mailman recognizes him from the picture at the post office -- unless that happens, there will be no more mention of him and his friend Jack Hewitt and our father. The story will be over. Except that I continue.</utterance>
