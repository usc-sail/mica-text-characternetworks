      <context>Billy looks at Hammond. With lightning sudden quickness, he reaches and produces a huge Bowie knife from behind his back. Billy smiles, laughs...then with a sudden, awful roar, he leaps at Hamnond who unflinchingly fires his pistol. The big slugs stop Billy cold and throw him back against the bed as Rosalie shrieks.</context>
