      <context>As the chant continues, wider angles show the chain-gang at work. They are black men in bleached and faded stripes, chained together, working under a brutal midday sun. It is flat delta countryside; the straight-ruled road stretches to infinity. Mounted guards with shotguns lazily patrol the line. The chain-gang chant is regular and, it seems, timeless. We slowly fade out, returning to</context>
      <utterance>splitting a rock.</utterance>

      <context>Everett gives an ingratiating smile as, behind him, the second convict starts to haul himself into the boxcar, the third convict still keeping pace outside.</context>
      <utterance>Say, uh, any a you boys smithies? The hobos stare.</utterance>
   <speaker>EVERETT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The convict running outside the boxcar door stumbles and disappears and the middle convict is yanked out immediately after. Everett, just finishing his speech, flips forward in turn, smashes his chin onto the floor and is sucked out the open doorway, his clawing fingernails leaving parallel grooves on the boxcar floorboards. The hobos impassively watch.</context>
      <utterance>Or, if not smithies per se, were you otherwise trained in the metallurgic arts before straitened circumstances forced you into a life of aimless wanderin'?</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!</utterance>

   <speaker>DELMAR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Everett makes a sudden hushing gesture and all listen. The baying of hounds is louder now, but through it we hear a distant scrape of metal against metal, like the workings of a rusty pump. The men turn in unison to look up the track. A small, distant form is moving slowly up the track toward them. As it draws closer it resolves into a human-propelled flatcar. An ancient black man rhythmically pumps its long seesaw handle. The three convicts look out at the swampland which begins to show movement, the bowing grass trampled by men and dogs. The flatcar draws even and slows.</context>

   <speaker>OLD MAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The old man pumps - reek-a reek-a reek-a - as all contemplate his words. Loud and sudden:</context>
      <utterance>...I cannot say how long this road shall be. But fear not the obstacles in your path, for Fate has vouchsafed your reward. And though the road may wind, and yea, your hearts grow weary, still shall ye foller the way, even unto your salvation.</utterance>

      <context>- The three men walk down a road excavated through banks of clay, from which gnarled tree roots protrude. - A pie rests on a windowsill, steam wafting from it. A hand enters from below the sill outside and disappears with the pie. A moment later we see Everett's and Pete's backs as they scamper away across the yard. A short beat, and then Delmar peeks over the sill. He ducks back down and then his hand reaches up to leave a dollar bill. Moments later we see him scampering away after Pete and Everett. - Another campfire. The three men sit around it laughing as they enjoy the pie, each with a slab on a plate improvised of old newspaper. Everett finishes his piece, licks his thumb and tosses the newspaper onto the fire. We jump in to look at the soiled newspaper as flame begins to curl its edge. A story is headlined 'TVA Finalizing Plans for Flooding of Arktabutta Valley'. The flame curls the page away, briefly revealing the page beneath - with a story headlined 'Soggy Bottom Boys a Sensation - But Who Are They?' - before it too is consumed. - A little general store. We are very high, looking down at a foreshortened Everett, Pete, Delmar and store clerk, who is wielding a long telescoping pole that stretches toward us. Everett is pointing up, directing the man with the pole. He moves it tentatively to and fro until, at a certain point, Everett nods vigorously. A reverse shows the end of the pole - a long stock-pincher - as it closes over a tin of Dapper Dan pomade, resting on a high shelf. The exterior of the store shows it to be on a corner of a little crossroads town. The three men are emerging from the store just as a car pulls up to one of the two bubble-topped gas pumps out front. A fancyman in a boater hat gets out of the car and heads for the store, passing the three; Everett glances at him and, as the man disappears inside, he dives into his car, waving for Delmar and Pete to follow. Delmar, initially reluctant, is hauled into the car by Pete, and the men take off. - The spinning 78 recording, as the song enters its last verse. - A spinning car wheel. - A panoramic boom up as the car toodles away, down a road that winds through scrub grass toward a distant sunset.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, mercy. Then - just the purple toilet water.</utterance>

      <context>The screen is flickering down to black as the music slows to sludge and stops. The theater is dark and quiet. Everett and Delmar, and the rest of the sparse audience, look restively about. A man carrying a shotgun enters the auditorium. He walks halfway down the aisle and stops several rows behind Delmar and Everett. He scans the theater, then brings a whistle to his lips. At his whistle the back doors burst open and a line of chained men trot in at double-time. With much clanking they file into one row and then, that row filled, the one behind it. They remain silently on their feet. The first guard and two others who escorted in the convicts scan the theater. The first guard again blows his whistle. The two rows of chained men sit. After another silence:</context>
      <utterance>Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...</utterance>
   <speaker>FIRST GUARD</speaker>

   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Everett and Delmar turn and stare, saucer-eyed. In the middle of the frontmost row of convicts sits Pete - bald, haunted Pete. After a long, disbelieving stare:</context>

   <speaker>DELMAR</speaker>

      <context>Everett, jaw hanging open, can only stare, as if at a ghost. Delmar stares also, but finally brings out another:</context>

   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They have rolled through some brush and their bodies are now halfway into a clearing. They abruptly stop. Pete, lying on top of Everett, looks up, startled by loud chanting. Everett, lying on his back, tries to see as well, his eyes rolling back in his head. Their point-of-view shows a great open field where men in bedsheets parade in formation before a huge fiery cross. Pete and Everett hastily crabwalk back into the bushes and then push through with Delmar. The ranks of hooded men, chanting in a high hillbilly wail, intersect and shuffle like a marching band at halftime. At length they stop in perfect formation, still chanting, to face the Imperial Wizard, who stands in front of the burning cross dressed in a red satin robe and hood trimmed with gold. An aisle leads through the middle of the formation to the burning cross, before which a gibbet has been erected. The backmost row has stopped, facing away, only a few yards from the bushes that hide Delmar, Pete and Everett. As the chanting continues, two Klansmen lead a black man, whom they grasp by either arm, up the aisle toward the gibbet.</context>

      <context>A broad-shouldered man in the middle of the ranks of Klansmen, sensing something, slowly turns to look back over his shoulder. He thus reveals that his hood has only one eye- hole. He slowly draws off his hood. It is, of course, Big Dan Teague. His one good eye looks about; his other eye, now revealed, is hideously clouded and stares up and off in fixed sightlessness. Everett, still crouched behind the bushes, notices something. He hisses and points.</context>
      <utterance>The noose. Sweet Jesus! We gotta save 'im!</utterance>
   <speaker>EVERETT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Off to one side is a robed and hooded three-man color guard displaying a Confederate flag. In front of the crowd the Imperial Wizard raises one satin- draped arm, and the chanting stops.</context>
      <utterance>The color guard.</utterance>
   <speaker>WIZARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Over in the bushes Everett, Delmar and Pete are straightening up and adjusting their appropriated robes and hoods, having disposed of the color guard.</context>

   <speaker>WIZARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A huge roar - and now the ranks resume their chanting. The color guard hustles up the aisle to draw up behind the two men leading Tommy to the gibbet. Everett hisses:</context>
      <utterance>And so... we gonna hang us a neegra!</utterance>
   <speaker>EVERETT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Behind Everett in the deep background someone emerges from the ranks into the middle aisle. He approaches with a strong, purposeful stride - Big Dan Teague, bareheaded, holding his hood under his arm. Everett hisses again:</context>
      <utterance>Hey Tommy! It's us!</utterance>
   <speaker>EVERETT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Tommy looks back over his shoulder.</context>

   <speaker>EVERETT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Whoosh - arriving Big Dan whips the hood from Everett's head. Everett is exposed - in blackface. The chanting abruptly stops. The crowd is stunned. Big Dan whips off the other two hoods - Delmar and Pete, in blackface. From the crowd:</context>
      <utterance>Listen to me, Tommy, I got a plan -</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Everett screams:</context>
      <utterance>The color guard is colored! Big Dan roars. The crowd roars.</utterance>
   <speaker>EVERETT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Pandemonium breaks out, and the Imperial Wizard takes off his red satin hood for a better view. He is the reform candidate Homer Stokes. Next to him, his midget also pulls of his midget hood. Stokes is peeved.</context>
      <utterance>Run, boys!</utterance>
   <speaker>STOKES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Everett, Pete, Tommy and Delmar, bearing the Confederate flag, are retreating across the neutral ground separating the mob of Klansmen from the burning cross. The mob pursues in full cry. When the intruders reach the foot of the cross, Delmar turns. He javelins the flagpole up and out toward the pursuing crowd. Homer Stokes is mortified.</context>
      <utterance>Who made them the color guard?</utterance>
   <speaker>STOKES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The crowd gasps and watches, heads tilted back, in silence. The only sound is the fluttering flag. Homer Stokes' eyes rise, hesitate and start to fall as the flag reaches its zenith and starts to descend. We boom down with the hurtling flag toward a sea of upturned white hoods. Dead in the middle is bareheaded Dan Teague. His arms are tensed out at his sides like a waiting kick-off returner. He squints up with his one good eye, judging distance and trajectory. From somewhere we hear a loud BOINK, as of a wire popping. The flag flutters. The crowd is silent. Big Dan sets and... WHAP! He snaps his hands up and together. He has caught the flagpole. The flag has not touched the ground. The crowd cheers. Big Dan looks around, beaming acknowledgement of the cheers. From somewhere, another BOINK. As Big Dan's look reaches front again, his smile fades. His eye tracks up - up- CREEEEEEK! The fiery cross is twisting and starting to fall. At the foot of the cross Everett snaps its last guy wire with his pincers - BOINK - and the four men sprint off. WHOOOOSH - As the crowd scatters, the cross descends toward Big Dan, frozen, looking up. It crashes in a shower of sparks and embers that obliterates Big Dan Teague.</context>
      <utterance>Damn! Can't let that flag touch the ground!</utterance>

      <utterance>These boys is not white! These boys is not white! Hell, they ain't even ol'-timey! I happen to know, ladies'n gentlemen, this band a miscreants here, this very evening, they interfered with a lynch mob inna performance of its duties!</utterance>

   <speaker>STOKES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>More boos. Waldrip approaches and nudges the microphone away to murmur confidentially in Stokes' ear. Stokes excitedly retrieves the mike and struggles to be heard:</context>
      <utterance>Listen to me! These boys desecrated a fiery cross!</utterance>
   <speaker>STOKES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This cuts no ice; the boos have become overwhelming.</context>

   <speaker>STOKES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The boos are deafening; the Soggy Bottom Boys, sensing opportunity, launch back into the interrupted verse of 'Man of Constant Sorrow'. The boos become wild cheers. Stokes is being pelted by foodstuffs. Shielding himself with one arm, he bellows into the mike:</context>
      <utterance>Folks, these boys gotta be remanded the 'thorities! Criminals! And I happen to have it from the highest authority that that Neegra sold his soul to the devil! He is hit by a tomato.</utterance>

   <speaker>PAPPY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He starts clambering up onto the stage. Two men advance through the clapping audience holding high either end of an eight-foot rail. When they reach Stokes, other audience members help load him onto the rail. Onstage, Pappy claps along with the audience. As they play, the band members fearfully eye Pappy, who advances on them. Pappy joyfully shakes his fat ass in time to the music and does a little two-step. The audience roars. The band relaxes, performing with even more gusto. Stokes is being through the crowd on the rail, jeered at and pelted with comestibles until he bangs out the exit. As the songs rolls into its big finish the audience roars approval, and Pappy elbows in to the microphone, beaming.</context>

A crowd carrying torches jogs behind a man in clanking leg irons and wrist manacles who is being escorted by four policemen trotting alongside, their nightsticks held across their chests in riot-ready formation. Everett and the rest of the Soggy Bottom Boys descend the last couple of steps to meet the oncoming criminal. Delmar cries out:</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Two shotgun-wielding goons fall in behind the four men and push them forward. Moving forward reveals, next to the oak tree, three fresh- dug graves. Standing at the far lip of each grave is a rough pine coffin. The sheriff with mirrored sunglasses, Cooley, steps off the porch, the drooling hound at his heels.</context>

      <context>The goons recover their leering grins and resume their happy task. The gravediggers stand next to the graves, leaning on their shovels.

      <utterance>Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.</utterance>

      <utterance>Uh-huh.</utterance>

      <utterance>A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.</utterance>

      <utterance>I don't care if it's ninety thousand.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yes, but honey -</utterance>
   <speaker>PENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Indignation quickens her pace. Everett keeps up, and the two are pulling forward out of frame.</context>
      <utterance>That wasn't my doing...</utterance>
   <speaker>EVERETT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We are now on the Wharvey gals who follow in a ragged bunch, still singing. From somewhere distant, through the song, we can just hear a rhythmic clack of metal on metal. The second-to-last girl is the oldest; she holds a piece of string along which we travel, still listening to Penny and Everett, off:</context>
      <utterance>Course not, honey, but...</utterance>
   <speaker>PENNY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I counted to three, honey.</utterance>
   <speaker>EVERETT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>We reach the end of the piece of string; it is wrapped around the waist of the toddler, who lingers in frame. She gazes down a quiet street at the edge of town that ends in an open field.</context>
      <utterance>Well sure, honey, but...</utterance>
   <speaker>EVERETT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His voice, and that of the singing girls, recedes.</context>
      <utterance>...finding one little ring in the middle of all that water...</utterance>
   <speaker>EVERETT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The string is given a tug and the little girl waddles out of frame. A train track is thus revealed in the distance. The rhythmic clack is from the hand-pumped flatcar. The blind seer pumps the car along the distant track, singing harmony under the Wharvey gals' receding voices.</context>
      <utterance>...that is one hell of a heroic task...</utterance>
