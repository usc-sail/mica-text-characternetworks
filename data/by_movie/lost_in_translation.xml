      <context>Bob wonders what she's leaving out, or if that's the way it works from Japanese to English.</context>
      <utterance>He wants you to turn, look in camera and say the lines.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's all he said?</utterance>

      <utterance>Yes, turn to camera.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Translator blots her face with a tissue, and asks the director in a Japanese sentence 5 times as long. The Director answers her in a long excited phrase.</context>
      <utterance>Turn left or right?</utterance>
   <speaker>TRANSLATOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Right side. And with intensity.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The excited Director says more in Japanese. Translator nods in understanding. Bob doesn't really know what's going on.</context>
      <utterance>Is that everything? It seemed like he was saying a lot more.</utterance>
   <speaker>TRANSLATOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Like an old friend, and into the camera.</utterance>
   <speaker>BOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Director yells something about ten sentences long. The translator nods.</context>
      <utterance>For relaxing times, make it Suntory Time.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Could you do it slower, and with more intensity?</utterance>
   <speaker>BOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Translator answers for him in four sentences. ON THE MONITOR - we see the next take: the moody lighting shines on Bob, the camera gets closer as he stares into camera and gives them the line.</context>
      <utterance>Okay.</utterance>

      <context>He pauses, then opens the door. A WOMAN in her forties in a short tight leather mini skirt and stockings comes in. She is wearing '60s style make-up. Bob sits on the bed not sure what to do as he watches her. Bob's POV - We see her back to us as she puts a CD on the stereo - it begins to play: Serge Gainsberg and Brigitte Bardot sing "Bonnie &amp; Clyde". The woman turns slyly around and shimmies over to Bob.</context>

   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He pulls his hands away. She grabs them and puts them back on her, and keeps struggling dramatically. They wrestle around awkwardly, her pretending to try to get away, but not letting him go. She rips her stockings and falls off the bed in fake- defense.</context>

   <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She pulls a confused Bob down on top of her. He doesn't know what she wants. She rips another stocking and pins him on the ground. He tries to crawl away, she grabs his leg and trips him. He grabs a nearby table leg as he falls, the lamp crashes to the floor, the room goes black.</context>

   <speaker>BOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He hangs up. The make-up artist dusts him with powder. The commercial people are crowding around. Bob's chair is swivelled around and we see him in his tuxedo, wearing too much make-up and some weird looking eyeliner. In front of a grey backdrop, moody lighting is being adjusted and Bob is handed a bottle of Suntory. small documentary crew moves in on Bob with a video camera- the camera man is tilting the camera at his face in arty dutch camera moves. The agency people crowd around. The photographer is excited and urges Bob to do dumb poses, he won't do.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.</utterance>

      <context>The photographer starts shooting. Bob obviously hates the whole thing, what you do for money.</context>

And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois, and she's still married to him.

Anyway, call me when you have a chance, I'm trying to put Thanksgiving plans together, whether we want to go skiing or. Daddy wants to stay home and have it here, which might be easier with Lauren and the children, but let me know what your feelings are, I do hope you and John can make it.
