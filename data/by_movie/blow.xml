The rules are the same. No English. No raising voices. No sudden movements. George offers their leader, TONY, beers for his men, and is politely declined. The count starts. George and Diego riff through ten thousand dollar bundles. Diego is still acting pissy. He's mumbling to himself, making faces, slamming the money all around. The guys keep a close eye on him. Diego finishes a stack, throws one of the bags on the ground. The conversation is in Spanish unless otherwise indicated.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The first run was fifteen kilos, which we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard shelled suitcases.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We wrapped the cocaine in kitchen cabinet paper, and duct tape, that way if there were any dogs in customs...</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack Stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of cocaine per week into the United States via twin-engine Cessnas. Jack would fly into North Carolina, we'd meet him there and drive it down to different distribution points...</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I never met Pablo Escobar. Diego Delgado was my only connection to cocaine from Colombia...</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Diego convinced me to keep most of my money in a Panamanian bank. Diego had a close relationship with Manuel Noriega. In exchange for allowing us to keep our money there, we paid him a percentage.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>There was an 85% chance that if you snorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it was ours. Initially with my LA connections, we invented the marketplace. In 1977, there was no other real competition.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The first year we made about 100 million dollars between us. It was an expensive operation. Eventually we built up to three different pilots doing multiple runs per week, connections on both coasts, everything was running smooth. We were like a corporation...</utterance>

      <utterance>he was very anti-government. He talked about revolution, forming his own country or island, he was looking for power as well as money. I was just looking for money.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He disliked the United States, thought it was a police state. He hoped that by flooding the country with cocaine, it would disrupt the political system and tear down the morality of the country.</utterance>

      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my connection, I met him back in 1968 when I first moved to Manhattan Beach. It was Foreal's marijuana connections that kicked off our cocaine market.</utterance>
   <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos to Los Angeles. When Diego finally got Derek Foreal's name from me, it was only a matter of months before he'd cut me out.</utterance>
