      <mode></mode>
      <context>The MIDGET slides the cup in front of the clown's face... as he picks up his head and smiles and nods yes... he sips the coffee and we see the clown is HELMUT DORQUE (pronounced Doork). He is a depressed and very unhappy clown... the frown on his face shows years of knocking around... plus fear that those years are now over. From o.s. we HEAR the SOUND of a small air horn being blown and carried by one of the midgets. He is yelling through an old megaphone.</context>
      <utterance>Coffee? It's nice and hot.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIDGET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Upon hearing this, "Clown Alley" really gets busy... all the clowns get up and put their last minute touches together... touching up their make-ups... getting their coats and props together... and as they get themselves up and ready, they exit the clown alley area and start for the arena. The last one to go is Helmut, lingering behind intentionally as we:</context>

      <utterance>Helmut, darling, are you all right?</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do I look like I'm not all right?</utterance>
   <speaker>ADA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I was so worried about you... Your dinner is cold and I couldn't imagine what happened to you...</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ada is hurt by this, but knows something is really chewing away at him... and deals with it even more tenderly, which only digs in deeper on Helmut.</context>
      <utterance>Were you really worried about me or your stupid dinner was getting cold?</utterance>
   <speaker>ADA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>During the above Helmut is at the small bar in the living room pouring another "blast" and gulps it down... he hears the words but tries to ignore them.</context>
      <utterance>Sweetheart, I care about you... I love you... I worry about you... I can't help those feelings...</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He flops down in the armchair and stares straight ahead... Again, Ada is hurt by his blasting her, but she's wise enough to know this isn't the man she loves... she has to get what's eating him out of there.</context>
      <utterance>If there is anything I don't need right now... it's your super- sentimentality...</utterance>
   <speaker>ADA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Helmut... what's tormenting your soul? Please let me help you... talk to me... I don't care what it is... I love you... I'm your friend... you can trust me to understand...</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I can't trust anybody... I don't know how to trust anybody...</utterance>
   <speaker>ADA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Helmut, hearing these words, looks up at her and sees the beauty in her eyes, and he is affected by this. He stands up and takes her in his arms... almost breaking her in two.</context>
      <utterance>I'm not anybody! I'm your wife!</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ada knows now what's happened.</context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry, my love... I'm so sorry... You're right! You're not anybody. You're my wife and I love you, too... So very much I just have no one to fight back at... I'm lost and alone, I can't handle the disgrace of failure... the pain of being a has- been is more than I can bear...</utterance>
   <speaker>ADA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Schmidt again? Gustav again? When will you learn they fear you and they know how vulnerable you are now... if they can beat you down then they needn't worry about you coming back to haunt them.</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They worry about me? Don't be ridiculous... they just took the last comic bit away from me... because of a silly accident... I'm now down at the bottom, just a stooge assisting a not-so-funny clown.</utterance>
   <speaker>ADA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But they can't take your talent away... That's your strongest force! Walking away from her, getting angry again...</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>What the hell are you talking about? What talent? And if I had any it's being suffocated into nothing... And that's just what I am now... nothing... No one... just empty... a prop to be used and mis-used... how does my great talent stand up to those odds?</utterance>
   <speaker>ADA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Helmut gets quiet and listens, and it makes sense... Ada knows she's got him now.</context>
      <utterance>By not quitting... You must fight! Creative survival is even more difficult than human survival... You must fight!!!</utterance>
   <speaker>ADA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Helmut hears it all and it sounds so good and right.</context>
      <utterance>Go to Schmidt... Force a confrontation... Don't let Gustav win... make Schmidt see what an injustice they are imposing on you... Please, my love, fight! Make your world better by fighting for it... You can do it... I know you can...</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ada happily gets his hat.</context>
      <utterance>I will go now and see Schmidt... I will tell him I won't take any more degradation... I will tell him I am a "clown" not a stooge... A "clown"... A special person... A special clown...</utterance>
   <speaker>ADA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She kisses him, opens the door for him and he goes.</context>
      <utterance>Go, my love... Go and fight for what you know is right... I will warm your dinner and wait for you to come home.</utterance>

      <context>Helmut drops his head, completely discouraged and saddened by what he knows is a losing battle. As he starts to walk away we can HEAR the tinkling of glasses and the slight laughter of the two men as we watch Helmut slowly scuff his way towards the backstage circus exit, as we: DISSOLVE (12-ft) HOLDING his walk over his limp body at bar.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Helmut stops with his BACK TO CAMERA looking straight at "Hitler" and screams:</context>
      <utterance>The trouble with man today is that he takes everything for granted... he thinks things he's told to think... and accepts it! Just because we know meanings of words we use them and we fool ourselves... people should use the dictionary more... look up words like good... bad... honest... loyal... especially loyal, I know what loyal means, and I have always been that... but does anyone care? No! Of course not... Only when it is expedient... When it isn't ---  --- ZIPPPP! You're out!</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He shoves his right arm up and out at the photograph of "Hitler".</context>
      <utterance>And that goes for you too... Mine Fuhrer...</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>During the above dialogue, two S.S. men along with two Gestapo men walk into the bar and sit at a table unseen by Helmut, and as they sit, Helmut continues:</context>
      <utterance>... you, too, are a fool. You allow yourself to think you have "loyal" followers... Ha! Wait until they've had it with you... You'll get yours... all the smiling, bowing, heel clicking idiots will shaft you too. And you will deserve it because if you allow people like Herr Schmidt to got about his business of lying, and cheating, and being disloyal, one day all the Schmidts in Germany will turn on you and you will finish as the dumb little corporal you started as, and never know what hit you...</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>I could help him by telling him about the people he thinks are good Germans... Ha! The two S.S. men and the two Gestapo men just happened to stop in the pub, they can't really believe what they are hearing, and the two S.S. men make a move to get up and secure Helmut. The head Gestapo man nods to them to stay seated and wait and listen. Helmut continues his rave and gets more violent as he goes on. Clause, the bartender, would love to tell him the Germans are there, but chooses to go about his business. Helmut is really getting the effects of the booze now and is bordering on flipping his lid, completely. (He does the stagger routine trying to get to the table on the other side of the bar furthest away from where the S.S. men and Gestapo men are sitting)... We play this for visual humor, but at the same time showing just how swacked he is!!! Helmut finally reaches the table he has been trying desperately to get to and falls into it, exhausted and emotionally drained. He looks around at the few people who have been watching him, most of which are frightened at what he has said, trying vainly to stay out of it. Helmut catches the eyes of the four men (S.S. and Gestapo) just looking at him.</context>
      <utterance>He really has to be stupid --</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The four men just stare at him with no answer.</context>
      <utterance>What are you staring at? Didn't you ever see a man drink before?</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Helmut gets up and walks over to their table... mumbling, and staggering as he goes...</context>
      <utterance>What's the matter? Haven't you guys got a sense of humor? You must have! Look how you're dressed! Grown men in their little soldier suits... And the black coats and gloves... Like in a movie...</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He hears this and gets hysterical laughing.</context>
      <utterance>Real cloak and dagger stuff... Didn't you Gestapo guys ever know that everybody can spot you a mile away?  Listen, if you really wanted to be unnoticed... You should dress like plain people, then nobody would know you... You might even wear straw hats and shorts...</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They just stare!</context>
      <utterance>Straw hats and shorts!! That's funny! Now that's really funny, isn't it? Straw hats and shorts!</utterance>

      <context>The corporal leans over the desk, and in order to see puts his hand on the desk to brace himself... Reicher smacks his arm, knocking his face flat on the desk... he stays there with his ass in the air, waiting for instructions. Reicher leans down putting his nose right to the corporal's nose.</context>
      <utterance>Do I see what I think I see here?</utterance>
   <speaker>REICHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Still in the same position, the Corporal extends his arm for a heil Hitler, which is virtually impossible in the position he is in.</context>

   <speaker>CORPORAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He exits, and returns with Helmut and one more guard. Helmut stands in the doorway, frightened and unsure, Reicher still pacing behind his desk feels Helmut's presence...</context>
      <utterance>Yes sir!!!!</utterance>
   <speaker>REICHER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Helmut walks to the chair in front of Reicher's desk... The spineless corporal moves towards the door... turns... and takes his position on the opposite side of the door that the guard is standing at... Reicher picks up the folder again, fingers through it. As he looks through the folder, he looks at Helmut and looks and fingers pages and the silence and the anxiety is getting to Helmut as he sweats and waits. Reicher is toying with him, and each time Reicher looks up the sick, little-boy smile crosses Helmut's face, hoping to endear himself to this Prussian pig! Reicher finally sits down beside his desk in a chair that resembles a throne. It is high and it looks down on Helmut. (Props: This chair must be higher and taller than Helmut's chair... for POV shots diminishing Helmut seated there.</context>

Then he runs toward the car and, with strength he really doesn't have, jumps up so that he gets his arms on the floor of the boxcar.

      <context>The children laugh, and some begin imitating Helmut's head movements. Others do the same, and still others, including the Czech youngsters, until all are waggling their heads at each other and loving it. Then, out of sheer adoration, the youngest of the children close in on Helmut and hug him around his legs. Slowly he stops waggling his head and stretches out his arms to embrace as many of them as he can -- almost as if trying to protect them. Suddenly the gaiety dissolves, and the children go solemnly silent. Helmut reacts.</context>

Helmut opens the burlap sack and begins handing out pieces of black bread. The children grab at the chunks and gnaw it voraciously. When all of the youngsters have been given the bread, Helmut takes a piece and bites into it with great relish. After a few chews on the bread:</context>

      <utterance>Good. We'll start by seeing that we all have our names on our heads.</utterance>

      <context>The little girl with the rag doll holds up the doll for Helmut to see.</context>
      <utterance>Yes, yes. There's Fritz, Maria, Sadie, Inga, Josef, Nathan, Helga, Willie...</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This is almost too much for Helmut, but he manages to control himself by turning away for a beat. Then he turns back to the children, his big smile back in place.</context>
      <utterance>Ah, yes, Frederika! Good. I see all of your names.</utterance>

      <context>He picks up Willie and stands him near the door.</context>
      <utterance>They... they want us to move to another building... where we'll have more room... to play.  Tell you what. Let's make it a big circus parade. Everybody get in a line behind...</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The children scramble up and begin forming a line behind the very proud Willie. Helmut looks around for the boy with the harmonica.</context>
      <utterance>... behind Willie here.</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He sees the boy and goes to him. Helmut pantomimes playing the harmonica and points to himself. The boy smiles widely, fishes the harmonica out of his pocket and holds it up.</context>
      <utterance>Now, where's our band? The harmonica?</utterance>
   <speaker>HELMUT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Helmut takes his place at the head of the line, like the Pied Piper, leads the youngsters out the door, playing a crude sort of circus parade music. The little children giggle excitedly as they troupe out. The older ones seem less certain, but as long as Helmut is with them, they feel secure.</context>
      <utterance>There we are? Everybody ready? Here we go.</utterance>
