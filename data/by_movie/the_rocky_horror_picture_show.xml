      <utterance>Well Brad, I guess we made it huh!</utterance>
   <speaker>BRAD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well I don't think there was any doubt about that - You and Betty have been almost inseparable ever since you sat in on Dr Scott's refresher lectures.</utterance>
   <speaker>RALPH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tell you the truth Brad, she was the only reason I came in the first place. Science was never one of my favourite subjects but I sure with Dr Scott could have made it today.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRAD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The GUESTS cheer.</context>
      <utterance>Yes, Janet and I are both fond of him. We drove over to see him last vacation. It's a shame his new job took him away from Denton. BETTY, the bride, throws the bouquet. JANET catches it. She squeals with delight.</utterance>
   <speaker>RALPH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey fella. It looks like it could be your turn next.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRAD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>RALPH &amp; BETTY drive off. GUESTS wave and shout, BRAD &amp; JANET with great enthusiasm. GUESTS begin to disperse. JANET &amp; BRAD linger outside the church. So do a strange FAMILY : An old man with a pitchfork and his wife and daughter. They resemble the Quaker family in "American Gothic", a painting. The MOTHER (MAGENTA) and FATHER (RIFF RAFF) stand outside the church doors. Their DAUGHTER (COLUMBIA) goes inside. The FAMILY, and the MINISTER (FRANK N. FURTER), and the GUESTS all resemble characters we shall meet later at the Frank N. Furter place. JANET (who is holding the bouquet) Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful. Didn't Betty look radiantly beautiful. Just an hour ago she was plain old Betty Monroe. Now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapschatt. BRAD (Still looking after the car) Er...yes, Janet.......Ralph's a lucky guy. (They start to move d.s.)</context>

      <utterance>It seemed a fairly ordinary night when Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss  left Denton that late November evening to visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and now friend of both of them. It's true there were dark storm clouds, heavy, black and pendulous, toward which they were driving. It's true also that the spare tyre they were carrying was badly in need of some air. But they being normal kids and on a night out, well they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening. On a night out. He closes the book marking the place.</utterance>

      <utterance>And so, by some extraordinary coincidence - fate it seems had decided that Brad and Janet should keep that appointment with their friend Dr Everett Scott. But it was to be in a situation which none of them could have possibly foreseen. And just a few hours after announcing their engagement, Brad and Janet had both tasted forbidden fruit. This in itself was proof that their host was a man of little morals - and some persuasion. What further indignities were they to be subjected to? And what of the sonic transducer and floor show that had been spoken of? What indeed? From what had gone before, it was clear that this was to be no picnic.</utterance>
