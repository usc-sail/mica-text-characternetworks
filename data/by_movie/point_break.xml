   <speaker>LADY PIGNOSE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The car slews backward onto the street, slamming a parked car. Lady Pignose slams the thing into DRIVE, cuts the wheel hard, and punches it, skidding on wet pavement. UTAH hurtles from the alley. He leaps, somehow TACKLES the DRIVER'S door handle and is dragged along the street. He pulls himself up, reaches inside the window, and whips the steering wheel hard right. The SEDAN fishtails into a parked Toyota. Utah bounces forward, slamming into the asphalt. Glass shards and crushed steel are strewn everywhere, as radiator steam whistles hot. Pig Nose 2, riding shotgun, is trapped. Can't get his crushed door open. The DRIVER pushes open her door. Gropes for her pistol. Utah springs -- no respect for a lady. He slams the door, pins her arm and slams again and again until the gun drops. Utah kicks it away as the woman collapses in pain. Pig Nose 1 bails out and runs across parking lot. Utah leaps up onto the crushed hood and draws down with the shotgun.</context>
      <utterance>Son of a bitch!</utterance>
   <speaker>UTAH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Pig Nose 1 spins. We sense reckless anger. He raises the UZI. Utah squeezes the trigger. No death. No blood. Just buzzers and flashing bulbs. Pig Nose's flak vest lights up like a pinball machine. Utah's laser weapon hit the "kill zone". Pig Nose rips the tape off his face and the FBI CADET shakes his head in disgust. OBSERVERS step forward. Bank customers. Bank tellers. All FBI personnel. MEDICAL STAFF offer the woman driver assistance. Pig Nose 1 heads for Johnny, but is subdued by other agents.</context>
      <utterance>Halt. FBI!</utterance>
   <speaker>PIG NOSE #1</speaker>
      <mode>FBI CADET</mode>
      <context>BINOCULARS runs out and pinches two fingers together, right in Johnny's face.</context>
      <utterance>I wanna say just two words to you, asshole, SIMU-LATION!!! Johnny- fuckin' Utah. Guys like you will do anything to win! Utah stares back in defiance. The SURVEILLANCE van pulls up nearby.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Utah turns to go. As he passes he casually raises his laser-shotgun and re-triggers Pig Nose's flak vest.</context>
      <utterance>I did stop the perpetrators.</utterance>
   <speaker>LIGHTS AND BUZZERS.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Screams and shoving matches and pissed off guys. Utah walks off, down the simulated street, past a sign which bears the FBI SEAL and reads "Combat Village, Quantico, Virginia."</context>
      <utterance>Pig Nose explodes. More agents restrain him.</utterance>

   <speaker>BIG SHOULDERS</speaker>

      <context>JOHNNY UTAH enters the pool area in the distance. Says something to one of the agents. Is pointed toward us as-- Corey ties the blindfold and guides Pappas to the edge of the pool.</context>
      <utterance>Okay, Pappas, let's put on the blindfold. Wanna see you retrieve at least two bricks from the bottom.</utterance>

      <context>Pappas snorts agreement and cannonballs into the pool. Huge backblast of water. The other agents hoot and holler. Corey swears and wipes off his clipboard. Johnny steps to the edge, looks down. We see the blindfolded Pappas groveling along the bottom. The other agents cheer as Pappas heads for the surface.</context>
      <utterance>The shit they pull, huh?</utterance>
   <speaker>COREY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>he'll take it right outta your hand. Pappas surfaces in an explosion of spray as he sputters for breath. He grabs the edge and angrily slaps two bricks on the tiles.

The bandits sprint for the front doors. Kennedy exits first, followed by Reagan. LBJ pauses under the surveillance camera, drops his trousers and MOONS.

PAPPAS slices a green apple, some feta cheese and eats off the knife. UTAH climbs back on his board. WHISTLES and HOOTS sound as SURFERS spot a new swell.

Tyler cringes, giving a look like it's hopeless. TYLER AND UTAH, at their cars, skinning out of their wetsuits. Utah looks exhausted, downcast. She snaps her wet towel at his ass, cheering him up. MALIBU PIER. RAIN. Tyler jumps out of her Porsche and sees Utah sitting in his car. She goes to him, opens the door and starts pulling him out. Come on you pussy. UTAH and TYLER wait their turn in the lineup. Rain pelts their faces. The waves are depressing inside mushers under a gray sky. Utah starts to paddle. Tyler shakes her head no.

AT THE SHOWER Johnny sets down his gear and opens his wetsuit to the warm, salt-free jet of water. TRACKING SLOWLY IN on him as he lets it pour over his face. A HAND ENTERS FRAME, shutting off the water suddenly. TIGHT ON UTAH, his eyes opening. REVERSE, revealing RAZORHEAD and THREE OTHERS. They are powerfully built SURF-NAZIS. Scalps shaved on the sides. Hair military short on top, lengthening into pigtails in the back. Tattoos. Wrist chains. TONE, ARCHBOLD and WARCHILD. The one who socked Utah before is BUNKER.

      <context>As they lunge, Utah grabs his board and swings it in a whistling roundhouse. Its edge slams Warchild in the gut and folds him double. The bad news is... Warchild gets an arm around it and brings a pile-driver hammer-punch down. The board splits into two pieces. Utah drops his end as the others close. A flurry of punches and kicks, most of which he blocks. But he's lost the offensive. Bunker takes him to his knees with a vicious karate-style side-kick. TIGHT ON Utah's towel, talking with Pappas' voice.</context>

He spins with remarkable agility and drives his heel into Warchild's face. Utah breaks free, staggering back on the sand. The fight is still there in his eyes. Bodhi is at his side -- holding the others at bay with a raised hand and an evil look.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Johnny uses the patented Tyler-pop and makes it to his feet. Suddenly he's going like a shot. He moves back on the board, trims out, slowing down. Maintains a fragile control. On pure adrenalized instinct, heart pounding, he falls in behind Bodhi, taking the same line along the roaring black face. Bodhi is like the Silver Surfer, ahead of him in the moonlight. Not wanting to drop too far behind, Johnny walks a little forward on the board. The nose dips, picking up speed. Johnny starts letting the speed work for him, learning that he can make long floating turns up and down the glassy face. Feeling the water under his feet, the tons of water piling up behind him... feeling its awesome power and borrowing a little of it. The Silver Surfer and the quarterback rocket through the night. Utah has a big feral grin plastered on his face. Bodhi looks back. Gives him a thumbs up. Then he cuts left and drops giddily down to the bottom, slashing back and climbing. Utah tries it, feels the drop like freefall... feels the speed. He makes his bottom turn, nearly falling. The grin dropping off his face. He falls in behind Bodhi again as the wave wraps over them like a great black wing. TYLER, paddling back out, watches them shoot past her. Utah raises his arms above his head and HOWLS like a gonzo wolf as they go by. She grins to herself, watching him. Knows he's gotten the ride that will make him a surfer for life.</context>

BABBIT and ANOTHER AGENT make it to the front corner of the stucco house, staying out of sight of the windows. ANGELO is walking up to the falling-down porch of this low-rent roach-hotel. JOHNNY is elbow-crawling between the house and a tall hedge. He slides quietly in below a bedroom window. He pulls out the little leather kit he tucked in his waistband. Removes something from it. A DENTAL MIRROR. Moving slowly, he raises it above the window sill, angling it where he can see inside. TIGHT ON DENTAL MIRROR, Johnny's POV. We see a bedroom through a gap in the venetian blind. Tone is lying on the bed, wearing headphones. Cranked up speedmetal. His eyes are screwed shut, and his fists pump to the beat like karate on 40,000 volts. The door to a bathroom is open, and the black-haired girl can be made out behind rippled shower glass. TIGHT ON DOORBELL as Pappas rings it. UTAH JUMPS at an explosion of sound. He spins in a microsecond, pistol aimed at... A LAWN MOWER. Through the hedge we can just see THE NEIGHBOR, sixtyish and polyester clad, as he adjusts the choke on the roaring machine about two feet from Johnny's face. Utah exhales and lowers the gun. Wipes sweat from his eyes. TIGHT ON PAPPAS, smiling open-faced and goofily charming as... THE DOOR opens, revealing a GIRL we haven't seen before.

      <context>He lets out a long breath and looks away, out to sea. JOHNNY'S POV... the water receding into a backlit wall of mist. FIGURES APPEAR, faint silhouettes in the fog. Shades of gray in the gray. IN SLOW MOTION they weave hypnotically across the screen, their shapes merging and unmerging as they cross each other. STACKED UP BY THE EXTREME LONG LENS, Bodhi, Roach, Grommet and Nathaniel crave and slash toward us with mystical grace. In SUSPENDED TIME we see them hooting and grinning at each other as they cut aggressive moves close to each other. Dolphins playing. Challenging each other in mock combat. So good, their boards slash past each other with inches to spare. There is an incredible sense of freedom and exhilaration. Bonding forged through mastery of this arcane art. For the first time we see the core group of Bodhi's tribe, by themselves. It dawns on us... There are four of them. And at that moment Nathaniel drops in front of Bodhi, laughing at the near miss, and drops his pants in a nasty wig-wagging moon. TRACKING SLOWLY IN ON JOHNNY staring, mouth open. Watching the four horsemen of the Apocalypse ride toward him. IN SLOW MOTION, BODHI grins as he slashes past Nathaniel's shining white butt. ON JOHNNY, as he reacts to the dawning certainty. He feels weak, dizzy... like the ground is moving under him.</context>

      <context>Cheerful, hardly able to contain his exuberance. He moves through the room, grabbing Johnny's shirt from a chair, a pair of sneakers on the floor. Utah sees his FBI shield sitting on the dresser in plain sight. He palms it when Bodhi is turned away, and slips it into his hip pocket to conceal it.</context>

      <context>Bodhi claps Utah on the back, ushering him outside. Nathaniel, Roach and Grommet fall into step beside them. The door closes behind them. CAMERA DRIFTS back through the apartment, coming to rest on the 9mm Beretta, on the floor under the bed... useless.</context>

   <speaker>BODHI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He pulls out a huge holstered handgun, rests it in his lap, draws and holds the gun up against his cheek.</context>
      <utterance>Banks are insured, brah. Long as nobody gets shot, it's really a victimless crime. Just gotta scare 'em a little, would be my guess.  Now if I was gonna rob a bank, with all those guys wearin' body armor these days, know what I'd carry? Bodhi reaches his hand underneath the seat.</utterance>

      <context>Bodhi stares at Utah, then flashes his signature smile. Utah says coldly.</context>

It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it. Check out the weight. He twirls the gun, grabs the barrel and extends the handle to Utah.</utterance>
   <speaker>UTAH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He hands the smoking weapon back to him. As if to say "two can play this game". Bodhi stands challenged. Each snared in the other's power... Bodhi takes the weapon back, casually. Slips it under the seat.</context>

      <context>One by one they stabilize. Falling face down, knees bent, they angle their hands and feet minutely to move laterally. Utah flails, the last to trim out. But he's holding his own. Grommet, working his duckfeet, pitches himself into a wild spin, rotating like a dervish in a head down dive. He flares out and "flies" back to the others. Rocketing through the void at 120 mph they seem to paradoxically hang above the world, almost unmoving... on a separate plane of existence. A hurricane of wind. Wild HOOTING. Despite his terror, Johnny has to grin at Nathaniel, falling butt first like he's sitting on a big inner tube in the pool.</context>

Johnny looks down. Impossibly close to the ground. Bodhi's canopy BURSTS OUT, an explosion of color. Below him is the shimmering mirror of a LARGE RESERVOIR. Two seconds later the bright yellow canopy meets its reflection and goes slack. An explosion of white water marks Bodhi's impact. LOW ANGLE AT WATER LEVEL as Utah hits. IN SLOW MOTION a glorious wall of backlit spray shouts skyward. Molten glass falling back in the bright desert dawn. Utah surfaces, sputtering, and shucks out of the harness. He floats like a jellyfish, gasping for breath.</context>

I could never make this thing work, myself. No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once. We shared time in this world. But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism. Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness. Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.

ON THE MAIN FLOOR the OFF DUTY COP slips his hands slowly around the butt of his pistol, concealing the move with his body. He signals with his eyes to the fat guard, glancing at the guard's ankle. TIGHT ON THE GUARD'S ANKLE where we can see a sliver of BACK-UP GUN, a tiny .25 auto in an ankle holster. The guard's eyes are pleading with the hard-on cop. "Don't make me do this". The guy is sweating, shaking. A yellow liquid spreads across the tiles next to his quivering hips. He's actually pissing himself, he's so scared. TIGHT ON the off-duty cop. Watching like a ferret. He cocks his .38. ECU GUARD'S EYES, wide with terror. It happens like lightning. The cop pops to his knees, straight-arming the .38. The guard goes for his ankle holster. REAGAN spins. The cop FIRES. BLAM! Reagan is catapulted backward off the counter by the impact. He crashes onto a desk on his back. Slides off, scattering papers. A teller screams. The cop spins toward Utah. Johnny throws down the shotgun. Shows his palms. He's holding out his gold star.</context>

      <utterance>Totally closed-out. It's fuckin' death on a stick.</utterance>
   <speaker>UTAH</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>Bodhi smiles, the odd smile of a sportsman who appreciates the cunning of his opponent. Utah sits beside his prey and stares at the ocean. Bodhi stares with glittering eyes at the heaving ocean before him, face splitting into that feral, death's head grin.</context>
      <utterance>I knew you wouldn't miss the fifty year storm, Bodhi.</utterance>
   <speaker>BODHI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.</utterance>
   <speaker>UTAH</speaker>

      <utterance>I'm not FBI anymore.</utterance>

      <context>Bodhi follows Johnny's gaze to the cops watching from the road.</context>
      <utterance>I asked them to give me a couple minutes... Utah calmly glances over his shoulder.</utterance>
   <speaker>BODHI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bodhi just stares at the waves, with awe and perhaps fear.</context>
      <utterance>It went bad, brah. Real bad.  I just felt it was time... A BOOMING ROAR sounds from the ocean.</utterance>
   <speaker>BODHI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Utah doesn't move to stop him as he stands, hefting the longboard. He half smiles, then turns toward the water, and starts walking. He stops. Turns around.</context>
      <utterance>Time to dance with the universe.  I could never handle a jail cell. You'll do this for me, won't you Johnny? Haven't I earned this much?</utterance>
   <speaker>BODHI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bodhi doesn't wait for a reply. He walks to the water's edge, and never looks back. He throws his board into the foam and paddles, the riptide pulling him out. The monsters dwarf his body as they quickly suck him into the trough of the holocaust. UTAH stands and solemnly waits for the universe to deliver final justice. The cops are running clumsily across the sand, too late to stop Bodhi. Tyler steps up behind Johnny, and puts her hands on his shoulders. BODHI is nothing more than a SPECK as he shoots across the lip of the colossal wave, carving the board downward -- AN UNTHINKABLE FOREHAND BLAST sends him into a 180 degree slide straight down the enormous face, eyes wild, his mouth opens in a soundless howl -- Bodhi and the outer- limits wave are locked for one impossible yet glorious moment in perfect harmony, perfect symmetry, perfect union... There is no fear in his face, only awe as the mountain of water closes out, burying the Bodhisattva in a whitewater grave... Pieces of broken surfboard explode upward, only to fall back into the raging whiteness and vanish. UTAH remains pensive, eyes fixed on the riderless surf. Tyler lowers her head. A fragment of surfboard washes up onto wet sand. The wind gathers force. Johnny finally turns to his woman, curls an arm around her shoulder, gathering her close. Tears are streaming down her face as she stares at the sea.</context>
      <utterance>Thanks, brah.</utterance>

      <context>CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP, rising high above their heads as the liquid vertical walls continue to hammer the Australian shore...</context>
      <utterance>He rode it all the way.</utterance>
