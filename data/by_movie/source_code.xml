      <context>He's back on the train. Back in the same navy sports coat. Across from him, Christina is at work on her sketch pad. Just like before. Other commuters all around him. Everything is exactly the same as before. Note: The remaining story will follow this "binary pattern." Scenes will take place either on the train or in the capsule. Compared to tomb-like isolation chamber he just came from, the train is exploding with sensory input -- the smell of steaming coffee, the cramped proximity of other passengers, the crinkle of an freshly-ironed dress shirt, the glint of a buckle on a purse, the slanting sunlight, the trees out the window, bursting with summer leaves. Almost unintentionally, Colter finds himself repeating the same opening actions as last time -- checking his watch (7:40 a.m.)... turning at the scent of passing coffee... peeking in the canvas messenger bag beside him... This time, however, he takes the books out of the messenger bag. The books are stamped "NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY." He also takes out the APPLE. Sniffs it. Takes a bit. It's good. No, it's awesome.

Sensory details slam into him. We go EXTREMELY CLOSE ON: The STITCHING on a leather purse. A FOUNTAIN PEN rattling in a fold-out tray. AIR CONDITIONING hissing from a vent. A CRUMPLING SOUND as the Overweight Man crushes an empty soda can. TAP, TAP, TAP -- the Computer Engineer tapping his foot on the floor. Faster and faster.

   <speaker>COLTER</speaker>

   <speaker>RUTLEDGE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>At last some useful information. Colter races to process it.</context>
      <utterance>So Source Code opens up another past for you. A parallel past. It looks the same but it has no intersection with our own world. In essence, by sending you back, an entirely new but utterly parallel world is created. It looks identical to ours, but nothing you do there has any effect on this reality.</utterance>
