McMURPHY'S POV The architecture is the same as the ward we left below, but it is the atmosphere that is different. A heaviness pervades all. Heavily sedated patients sit isolated from each other. Others stand shifting from one foot to the other, while others walk up and down the hallway, their locomotive powers not unlike that of Parkinson's Disease (caused by too much sedation). Suddenly, one patient gets up, speaking very angrily, shouting incoherently at no one; he crosses the hall and enters a side room. An aide goes in after him. A long beat, then the aide comes out with the patient and gently leads him back to his seat, talking softly to the man. Further down the hallway, a gurney is wheeled out of the east room with a patient lying on it, out cold; he is wheeled further down the hall to the men's dorms, where he is left to sleep it off. Two aides come out of the EST room and head in McMurphy's direction, where one of the aides motions to the patient sitting next to McMurpby.</context>

Then, suddenly, he slaps his thigh. McMURPHY Hey, hey, you ding-a-lings, you creeps, you goons... He enters the room doing a jig. The Acutes' faces light up.</context>

      <context>Billy goes off and sits by Big Nurse. Now, the lineup on the bench is Billy, Big Nurse, Candy and Rose. Spivey blows the whistle. Under the Aides' basket, Harding passes the ball into McMurphy, who dribbles to half court, takes his mark, and lobs the ball over the outstretched arms of the Aides right into Bromden's waiting hands. Bromden turns and slams the ball into the basket. The crowd goes bananas. Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 2 Bromden walks in majestic dignity the full length of the court and takes up his position under the Aides' basket, while McMurphy and his teammates have been putting tremendous pressure on the Aides, not allowing them to pass the ball in. As soon as McMurphy sees that Bromden is firmly set, hands held up, under the Aides' basket, McMurphy turns and runs down court, followed by the other Acutes, where they take up their defensive position. Washington and the Aides easily bring the ball down court, work themselves into position, and take a shot at the basket, which Bromden swats aside. Each Aide gets a shot at the basket, and each time Bromden swats it aside; sending the last swat into McMurphy's waiting hands. McMurphy dribbles the ball up court, where he runs into heavy pressure from Washington.</context>

      <context>Billy sinks back in his seat. On the court, McMurphy dribbles down to half court where he is stopped by Washington and Warren, who put the squeeze on him. McMurphy turns and gives them his ass to contend with, then manages to throw the ball under his legs and Washington's legs. The ball rolls to Martini, who scoops it up and throwing it wildly away, the ball ricochets off the backboard and goes in for two points. The crowd goes bananas. Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 6 Bromden starts striding down court when the Aides make a fast break past him, but miss their shot. McMurphy retrieves the ball as Bromden, not more than several feet from his own basket, does an about-face and returns to his basket where he turns to see McMurphy lob the ball full court to Bromden, who catches the ball on one bounce, turns and slams the ball in for another basket. Score: AIDES 10 PATIENTS 8 The crowd goes bananas and Bromden turns and starts striding down the court when he sees McMurphy at the far end of the court yelling at him.</context>

      <context>Candy rises, kisses Billy on the cheek, and dances with him. McMurphy beams on the twosome, unscrews his whiskey bottle, takes a long pull on the juice, and looks at Bromden. Bromden sits by the window waiting.</context>

      <context>McMurphy allows himself to be led to the heavy security partition, by the men's dorm, where all the patients are lined up. It is morning and the day room is a mess: A few chairs turned over. Paper cups and empty bottles. Puddles of cough syrup, orange juice and apple juice worked into sticky masses. Rose sits by herself on the couch. Bromden is the last one led to the lineup, where Big Nurse waits.</context>

      <context>Big Nurse's question is cut off as all the patients and attendants turn their heads toward the hallway and start laughing. Big Nurse turns to see Turkle, without his shirt on, walk into the seclusion room and close the door behind him. Big Nurse turns and starts down the hallway, the laughter trailing after her when, suddenly, the laughter breaks off as Big Nurse stops and in the silence, she opens the door.</context>

      <context>Washington nods to Warren and the two of them scoop Billy off the floor and carry him screaming to Doctor Spivey's office as Big Nurse crosses into the nurses' station and picks up the phone as Candy eases her way into the day room and joins McMurphy. A beat, then Miller starts herding the patients toward the washroom, staying clear of McMurphy and Bromden, who don't move. McMurphy pulls the keys out of his pocket.</context>

Big Nurse and Nurse Pilbow rush out of the nurses' station and head down the hallway. McMurphy is glued to the spot.</context>
