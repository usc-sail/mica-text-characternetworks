      <utterance>. . . so let's talk about the future. So let's talk about what video means to this industry -- and let's talk about how all of us -- not one of us -- but all of us will profit. I've been doing theater work in San Francisco and San Diego for as long as you've been doing stag and hardcore, Jack.</utterance>

   <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>

      <utterance>No one's doubting your history or your credentials, Floyd.</utterance>
   <speaker>FLOYD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then why the resistance? I mean: This industry is going to be turned upside down soon enough --</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then why help it?</utterance>
   <speaker>FLOYD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This is the future. Video tape tells the truth.</context>
      <utterance>Why not be prepared? The money comes from the Colonel, the talent comes from you, Jack. I've got a connection to the equipment and the mail order distribution, not to mention those kids I got out there who are hot-fuck-action to the max.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have a stable of actors and actresses. They're professionals. They're not a bunch of fucking amateurs. They're proven box office and they get people in theaters  and they know how to fuck well --</utterance>
   <speaker>FLOYD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's right, Jack and by that same token, you're the one with the power here. The video revolution is upon us -- and our role is critical. We have an obligation to use our resources and talent to help make it fly --</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You come in here, at my party, tell me about this and that -- tell me about the future, tell me about -- video and amateurs and all that -- well lemme tell you something now: I will not shoot films on video and no I will not loan out my actors who are under contract to me. Period.</utterance>
   <speaker>FLOYD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Wait a minute, Jack. I'm not a complicated man. I like cinema. In particular, I like to see fucking on film. I don't want to win an Oscar and I don't want to re-invent the wheel -- I enjoy simple pleasures like butter in my ass and lollipops in my mouth. That's me -- call me crazy, call me a pervert, but this is something I enjoy. One other small thing I want to do in this life is make a dollar and a cent in this business -- I'm not trying to hurt you. I'm trying to help you stay one step ahead of the game --</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We're repeating ourselves now, Floyd.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Jack, I think this is about cost and future --</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The future is as bright as we make it -- it shouldn't be sacrificed for a few dollars that can be saved shooting on video tape -- if it looks like shit and sounds like shit, it probably is shit --</utterance>

   <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I think that there is a serious case to be made for the price and the gamble on the whole idea of a home video market -- Jack: Two, three years from now, everyone's gonna be able to walk into their local supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette --</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>True film fans won't watch that shit. It doesn't look good and more importantly it doesn't make sex look sexy.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It doesn't have to look good, Jack. Film is just too damn expensive. The theaters are already planning converting to video projectors.</utterance>
