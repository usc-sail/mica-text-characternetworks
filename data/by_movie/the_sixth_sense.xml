      <context>MALCOLM CROWE sits on the floor at the coffee table, his vest and tie on the sofa behind him. A jacket and an overcoat lay on a brirfcase next to him. Malcolm is in his thirties with thick, wavy hair and striking, intelligent eyes that squint from years of intense study. His charming, easy-going smile spreads across his face. He points.</context>
      <utterance>It's getting cold.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Malcolm points to the HUGE FRAMED CERTIFICATE propped up on a dining room chair. It's printed on aged parchment-type paper. The frame is a polished mahogany. He slips on the sweatshirt.</context>
      <utterance>That's one fine frame. A fine frame it is.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How much does a fine frame like that cost, you think? Anna hands the backup bottle over to Malcolm.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Malcolm uncorks the wine and starts pouring in the empty glass.</context>
      <utterance>I've never told you... but you sound a little like Dr. Seuss when you're drunk.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Anna giggles. She's clearly buzzed herself. Malcolm doesn't get it. Anna takes a few calming sips of her wine. Her attention slowly moves to the framed certificate.</context>
      <utterance>Anna, I'm serious. Serious I am, Anna.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Anna ignores Malcolm and clears her throat. She leans forward her seat and reads the certificate out loud as Malcolm tries to tickle her.</context>
      <utterance>Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Beat. The power of the words sobers the two of them.</context>
      <utterance>In recognition for his outstanding achievement in the field of child psychology, his dedication to his work, and his continuing efforts to improve the quality of life for countless children and their families, the City of Philadelphia proudly bestows upon its son Dr. Malcolm Crowe... That's you... the Mayor's Citation for Professional Excellence.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Wow. They called you their son.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Anna turns to Malcolm. He smiles.</context>
      <utterance>We can keep it in the bathroom.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Anna's expression becomes serious.</context>
      <utterance>It's not real, Anna. Some secretary wrote that up. Don't tell me you thought it was real?</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She just keeps staring. Beat.</context>
      <utterance>What?</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Beat.</context>
      <utterance>Don't do the quiet thing. You know I hate it.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Malcolm plays softly with her face. Anna takes his hands and holds them steady.</context>
      <utterance>This is an important night for us. Finally someone is recognizing the sacrifices you made. That you have put everything second, including me, for those families they're talking about.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Anna lets go of his hands. Anna's eyes are emotional. Malcolm smiles softly.</context>
      <utterance>They're also saying that my husband has a gift. Not an ordinary gift that allows him to hit a ball over a fence. Or a gift that lets him produce beautiful images on a canvas... Your gift teaches children how to be strong in situations where most adults would piss on themselves.  Yes, I believe what they wrote about you.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Anna leans towards him. They hold each other tight. Beat.</context>
      <utterance>Thank you.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Anna laughs as she wipes her eyes.</context>
      <utterance>What are we hugging about again?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Nothing. There wasn't supposed to be any crying at this celebration. Just a lot of drinking and sex. Malcolm's charming, easy-going smile returns.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Anna hands him his glass. He stares at it.</context>
      <utterance>I would like some red wine in a glass.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Malcolm looks at Anna surprised at what he said. They crack up laughing. THEIR SWEET LAUGHTER FILLS THE HOUSE.</context>
      <utterance>I would not like it in a mug. I would not like it in a jug.</utterance>

   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The stranger slowly looks up for the first time. His eyes lock on Malcolm.</context>
      <utterance>This is forty-seven Locust Street. You have broken a window and entered a private residence. Do you understand what I'm saying?</utterance>

   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The stranger suddenly comes forward into the doorway. Malcolm stumbles back onto the edge of the bed. Anna sees the stranger for the first time. Her face drains of color. The stranger looks at Malcolm. He half grins.</context>
      <utterance>There are no needles or prescription drugs of any kind in this house.</utterance>
   <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The stranger's stare slides to Anna.</context>
      <utterance>Are you drunk?</utterance>
   <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The stranger gazes at Anna. Gazes directly into her eyes. A penetrating, unwavering stare.</context>
      <utterance>Did you get him drunk?</utterance>
   <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Anna's expression instanly changes.</context>

   <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>

      <context>Malcolm stops all movement.</context>

   <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Malcolm can't speak. Beat. The stranger's face starts to tremble.</context>
      <utterance>Let's all celebrate, Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Recipient of awards from the Mayor on the news. Dr. Malcolm Crowe, he's helped so many children... And he doesn't even remember my name?</utterance>
   <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>

      <context>Beat. Malcolm's intelligent eyes race for answers.</context>
      <utterance>I was ten when you worked with me.</utterance>
   <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Malcolm looks like someone hit him with a sledgehammer.</context>
      <utterance>Downtown clinic? Single parent family?  I had a possible mood disorder...  I had no friends... you said I was socially isolated.  I was afraid -- you called it acute anxiety...  You were wrong.  Come on, clear your head... Male, nine... Single parent... Mood discorder... Acute anxiety.</utterance>
   <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Tears jump into the stranger's eyes.</context>
      <utterance>I'm nineteen. I have drugs in my system twenty-four hours a day... I still have no friends. I still have no peace. I'm still afraid.</utterance>

   <speaker>COLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Cole senses someone. He looks up and sees Malcolm staring at him. The boy immediately goes white. Every cell of his body still with fear.</context>
      <utterance>Pro... Fun... Add... The words are unintelligible.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Cole stays rigid. Hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen.</context>
      <utterance>It's okay, Cole. Don't be frightened.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Malcolm waits for a response. None comes.</context>
      <utterance>My name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe. I was supposed to meet you today. Sorry I missed our appointment.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Beat. Cole slowly slides down the pew, giving Malcolm most of the seat. Malcolm sits. Cole fidgets with his soldiers. Beat. Malcolm looks over and stares at Cole's glasses. He leans forward to inspect them more carefully.</context>
      <utterance>Do you mind if I sit down? I have this injury from a couple of years ago and it flares up every once in a while just so I won't forget it.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.</utterance>

      <utterance>They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.</utterance>

      <context>Malcolm returns to staring at his lap. Beat.</context>

   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.</utterance>

      <utterance>...De profundis clamo ad te domine.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLE</speaker>

      <utterance>All your soldiers speak Latin?</utterance>
   <speaker>COLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Malcolm smiles at Cole. His eyes drift down to Cole's arms. Malcolm's smile slowly disappears. Cole's arms are covered in TINY CUTS AND BRUISES. Some almost healed. Some fresh. Malcolm looks around to gather himself. Beat.</context>
      <utterance>No, just one.</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Cole looks up.</context>
      <utterance>I like churches, too.  In olden times, in Europe, people used to hide in churches. Claim sanctuary.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What were they hiding from?</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Malcolm studies Cole's anxious face.</context>
      <utterance>Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Malcolm and Cole just stare at each other.</context>
      <utterance>Right.</utterance>

      <context>Beat.</context>
      <utterance>I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.</utterance>

   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I got an award once. From the Mayor.</utterance>

   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.</utterance>

      <utterance>You use needles?</utterance>

      <utterance>No.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?</utterance>

      <utterance>No.</utterance>

      <utterance>I'm going to see you again, right?</utterance>
   <speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Cole thinks it over carefully.</context>
      <utterance>If it's okay with you?</utterance>
   <speaker>COLE</speaker>

      <context>Cole and Malcolm just stare at each other.</context>

      <utterance>And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Cole turns and starts to the rear of the church. Malcolm loses himself in his thoughts. When Malcolm looks back, he sees Cole stop by the exit doors and take a tiny STATUE OF JESUS off the back table. Cole pockets the statue and quietly leaves the church. Malcolm just sits and stares.</context>
      <utterance>Next time I won't be scared of you.</utterance>

      <context>Lynn unclips the tie. Cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as Lynn walks back into the laundry room. The dog is gone now. Lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a new tie. She finds one, then turns and steps back into the kitchen and SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS. Every cabinet and every drawer is wide open. Cole sits at the kitchen table. His hands are pressed flat on the tabletop. He looks shaken. Neither says anything for a beat.</context>

      <context>Malcolm presses his fingers to his temples like a vaudeville magician. He closes his eyes tight.</context>
      <utterance>Here's the game. I'll read your mind. If what I say is right, you take a step forwards the chair. If I'm wrong, you take a step backwards the doorway. If you reach the chair, you sit. If you reach the door, you can go. Deal? Cole tilts his head, then nods, "Yes."</utterance>

      <context>Beat. Malcolm puts his fingers to his temple. This time a little bit slower. He gazes at Cole's school uniform.</context>

Didn't help that one at all. He thinks about that one a lot. Can't forget.  Ever since then, things have been different. He's become messed up. Confused. Angry. Not the same person he used to be.  His wife doesn't like the person he's become. They don't speak anymore. They're like strangers.</utterance>

They rush past the young man and the young woman to the front of the store. They find the glass front door cracked in a spider web pattern. They carefully push open the door and step out onto the sidewalk. Look around. No one in sight. Anna stares down the empty street. A concerned expression on her face.</context>
