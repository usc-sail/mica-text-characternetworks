      <context>They sit on the couch in front of the television. The TV monitor: We begin on the TV, then the videotape fills the entire frame. The videotape shows the front of THE MADISON HOUSE, the camera panning slowly over it. The picture is accompanied by an eerie DRONING SOUND. After the camera pans back to the front door, the tape image turns to snow. Fred and Renee stare at the snow for a few moments. Renee looks relieved.</context>

Pete winces and wheels himself out from under the car. He stands as Mr. Eddy walks up to him, then freezes as he sees - back behind Mr. Eddy, sitting in the passenger seat of the car - a beautiful blonde-haired GIRL, who looks exactly like Renee. CLOSE UP BEAUTIFUL GIRL - she looks exactly like Renee except she is about eight years younger. The girl is staring right into Pete's eyes. Mr. Eddy steps between Pete and the girl - blocking her from Pete. Mr. Eddy smiles at Pete - not noticing or not letting on that he notices the serious eye contact going on between Pete and the girl.</context>

Suddenly, there are two knocks on the other side of the closed door. The Slickster moves off the door and opens it a crack. He talks quietly to someone Alice can't see, then he turns, opens the door and gestures for Alice to go through. Alice puts out her cigarette - her hand is shaking. She walks over past the Slickster and enters a much larger room. There are about FIFTEEN MEN in the room - all leaning comfortably at different points on the walls. There is only one chair in the room - Mr. Eddy is sitting in it. No one says anything to her, but one man nods his head and from this nod, Alice feels she should walk to the center of the room. She does, and she instinctively turns to the man sitting in the chair. They all just stare at her silently. She looks around nervously - her eyes return to Mr. Eddy's. Suddenly, a man steps quickly up to her - draws a pistol and cocks it against her head. Alice goes weak in the knees. Her eyes fill with fear. The men continue to stare. Mr. Eddy gives Alice a small gesture as if to say "well?". Somehow she knows what they want, even though they haven't asked for it with words. Alice starts to undress - slowly - in as sexy a way as she knows how. The men just stare without expression. When she is completely naked, Mr. Eddy gestures her over to him. Soon she is on her knees in front of him - making herself available for whatever he wants. Mr. Eddy's POV - Alice looks in his eyes. She reaches her hand up to stroke his cheek...</context>

Pete turns and sees Andy staggering, blood streaming from the wound in his head, THEN CHARGING FULL SPEED AT PETE. Andy hits him hard, and Pete goes down. When Pete hits the ground, he pushes Andy up and throws out his arms. This, and Andy's momentum, catapult Andy into the corner of the rectangular glass-topped coffee table. There is a sound like a hammer going through a bucket of eggs as the glass corner embeds about eight inches into Andy's forehead. CLOSE UP OF ANDY'S HEAD - impaled on the sharp corner of the table, his chest area suspended, his legs and stomach touching the floor.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>He goes to the door and opens it a crack. As the door opens, Fred smashes the gun into Mr. Eddy/ Laurent's face and pushes his way inside the room. Fred hits Mr. Eddy/Laurent viciously again with the gun barrel. Mr. Eddy/Laurent is bleeding profusely from gashes on his forehead and nose.</context>

   <speaker>FRED</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Fred puts the pistol up against Mr. Eddy/Laurent's head and marches him out of the room - past the camera's eye. The camera stays in the room and moves slowly toward the window, through which we see Fred and Mr. Eddy/Laurent appear down below in the back lot. Still watching out the window, the camera sees Fred knock Mr. Eddy/Laurent over the head with the gun butt and put him into the trunk of a car. Fred slams the trunk lid and climbs into the driver's side of what is obviously Mr. Eddy/Laurent's car - the Mercedes 600 Pullman. As Fred drives away, a HAND appears in our window foreground. The hand moves the window curtain further to one side. The camera pulls back to reveal it as the hand of the Mystery Man. The Mystery Man leans fully into the frame and watches Fred drive off down the Lost Highway as day breaks.</context>
