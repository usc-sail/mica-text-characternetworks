      <utterance>Not from the city. In every city it's the same. Dead. Let's get out to the barrier islands. If there are survivors sending those signals that's where we'll find them.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIGUEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Miguel is drifting. The sight of the dead city has pushed him a few inches closer to the brink of insanity. He catches himself and comes back toward reality.</context>
      <utterance>Plenty of time for the islands. The rest of our...life...on the islands...I think.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>A coughing fit interrupts his Act of Contrition. From across the open cabin, from within SARAH'S arms, MIGUEL stares. His eyes have the glaze of a madman's eyes. Despite that, and despite the physical trauma he has endured, he seems remarkably in command.</context>

   <speaker>MARIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The woman folds TONY'S corpse into her arms as though trying to give it life from her own wounded body. For a long moment there is only the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the tired engine.

   <speaker>MIGUEL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>MIGUEL is sweating profusely yet shivering as though cold. FLIES ARE BUZZING in a cluster around his WRAPPED STUMP. He's over the edge now, insane. And worse than that, the infection from the original bite is spreading. The amputation was not done quickly enough to prevent the parasites from racing through his veins to the brain and elsewhere. SARAH turns towards the madman once her lover. Her heart is too callused for emotion to reach it. She just stares, her eyes dead cold like the eyes of a shark.</context>
      <utterance>I think we should burn the church. Kill the priest and burn the church. It's the only way. The only way.</utterance>

   <speaker>MIGUEL</speaker>

      <context>MIGUEL'S eyes roll up into his head. His knees buckle. SARAH grabs him under the arms barely keeping from falling face first into the muddy swamp water. CHICO comes to help.</context>

   <speaker>CHICO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly there's A GREAT RUMBLING, like the giant gears and pistons of a drawbridge being activated. The iron plate shudders and starts to move, downward, into the earth. SARAH AND CHICO duck into the nearby jungle.</context>

   <speaker>RHODES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He moves slowly towards the thicket followed by TOBY TYLER AND SEVERAL OTHER SOLDIERS. He reaches down to his belt and pushes one of THREE BUTTONS on A UNIT that resembles a pager. ELECTRONIC BEEPS, like the ones we heard earlier, come from the unit, this time in a different pattern. THE RED COAT ZOMBIES respond quickly. They draw their PISTOLS and go marching off after their leader, grunting and snorting like bull apes. RHODES' grin breaks into a wide-open laugh.</context>
      <utterance>We have visitors. Let's go men.</utterance>

      <context>TOBY looks down at the man, at his TERRIBLE WOUNDS, clearly fatal ones. TOBY clicks a shell into the firing chamber of his RIFLE. His finger is just sliding under the trigger shield when CAPTAIN RHODES strides up behind him.</context>
      <utterance>Yes...yes, do it...please...you can't let me die this way...please. Destroy me. A bullet...in the head...I don't want to become...one of...one of them.</utterance>
   <speaker>RHODES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>TOBY is startled by the voice at his back. He turns towards the captain, then he looks back down at the guerillero, hesitating..</context>
      <utterance>Take his weapon, Tyler.</utterance>
   <speaker>RHODES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Reluctantly TOBY obeys, reaches down for CHICO'S PISTOL.</context>

   <speaker>RHODES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>THE THIRD SOLDIER reaches down and grabs the wounded guerillero under the arms. TRICKS stoops to help. CHICO screams in agony when he is moved. TOBY lunges in to help the others, thinking to ease the man's pain.</context>
      <utterance>Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.</utterance>
   <speaker>RHODES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>TOBY grimaces but doesn't speak. He turns and moves briskly towards the clearing. RHODES watches him go.</context>
      <utterance>They can handle it, Tyler. You've been buckin' for a shit detail lately so here's one you're gonna love. We've got two dead. Cut the heads off and get the bodies underground to the refrigerators. Fast. It's a hot day.</utterance>

      <utterance>And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?</utterance>

      <context>RHODES has it in for TOBY (we'll find out why later), and of course the feeling is mutual. TOBY sets the bag down on the ground and, seething, he trots off towards the rest of the platoon. TRICKS follows. After a moment, RHODES motions with his head. THE SOLDIER WITH THE LONG NOOSE POLE steps into view with the CAPTIVE ZOMBIE, the one that ran amok earlier. The man follows RHODES towards the jungle, dragging the gurgling creature along, the wire noose digging into the thing's neck.</context>

      <utterance>It may be that none of these chicken-shits will talk while the whole troop is present...but I know some of these men well.

Leave it with the others. Take the rest of his body down to the freezers. Move it, shit hill. TOBY moves off. RHODES' grin returns.</utterance>

There's BILL McDERMOTT, wearing the grease- covered jump-suit of a mechanic and swilling generous shots of brandy from a hip flask, and there's a smallish woman with a sensitive face who, apparently out of character, is armed to the teeth. She's a deaf mute, nicknamed SPIDER, and she is urgently signing "Come on! Let's get outa here!" with her hands.</context>

      <utterance>That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress.

   <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>SARAH gets behind JOHN, his orange circle acting as her shield. He reaches around with one strong arm and pulls her in tight against his back. THE ZOMBIES, snarling and showing teeth, move through the thicket. ONE shuffles right past SPIDER AND McDERMOTT. It gets stuck in the bramble, changes course and moves on without attacking. ANOTHER ZOMBIE, a "white", trudges within arm's reach of JOHN, growling all the while. Suddenly it reaches its arms out and takes two angry steps towards the humans who back away. THE ZOMBIES charges. Things happen quickly. JOHN pushes SARAH away and swings the MACHETE. THE BLADE SINKS INTO THE CREATURES SKULL. BLACKENED BLOOD FLIES. An instant later SPIDER'S SICKLE PUNCHES IN BESIDE THE BIG KNIFE. THE ZOMBIE twitches for a moment, its eyes rolling, then it falls, lifeless, to the ground. McDERMOTT trots up beside SARAH. He takes a huge swallow from his flask then offers some to her. She puts the flask to her lips but nothing comes. She holds it out, neck down, to show that it's empty. McDERMOTT Sorry. Guess I don't know my own strength. JOHN wipes SARAH'S MACHETE on some thick leaves, cleaning off most of the gore, then he returns the weapon to the woman.</context>
      <utterance>Give that to me. Get behind me. Stay behind me.  You ain't wearin' a vest. They been taught not to touch the ones with the circles. There ain't no hundred percent, all-a-time rules with the Bees, but most-a-time they leave us alone. The colour on their vests tell ya how much schoolin' they got. It's the ones without colours you gotta watch out for.</utterance>

On the cell door we notice A PLAQUE with a number (5) and, written in marker, the Red Coat's nickname, "BLUTO". RHODES moves past OTHER CELLS, each holding A NICKNAMED RED COAT. GRUMPY stands way back in the shadows. TONTO stands near the bars, growling. FATSO is swaying back and forth like a chubby five year old who needs to pee. RHODES stops at A CELL marked "BUB!".

THE BLADE SINKS DEEPLY INTO THE ZOMBIE'S FOREHEAD. LOGAN pulls it out and strikes again, and again, and again, like a swordsman thrusting, thrusting, thrusting. Finally the creature collapses. LOGAN wipes the scalpel on his already blood-covered apron. RAIN WATER drops onto him from holes in the roof above. He doesn't seem to notice.</context>
