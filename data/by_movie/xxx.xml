      <utterance>Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.</utterance>

It's scary as hell. A professional take-down. They slam Xander against the wall. Just like that it's quiet again. Sky hyperventilates, a gun in her face.</context>
      <utterance>You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now. She heads towards the front door. Just then the door BLOWS IN.</utterance>

      <utterance>Hey. Where am I? How did I get here?</utterance>
   <speaker>WAITRESS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Xander looks around, sees a TRUCKER chewing with his mouth open. A SALESMAN buried in his NEWSPAPER. Xander gets up. Where the hell is he? He takes a step towards the door.</context>
      <utterance>I don't know, you wandered in ten minutes ago and put your head down. I told you we were closing.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAITRESS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Want some coffee?</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Waitress pours him coffee. QUICK PUSH TO: her hands are shaking.</context>
      <utterance>Huh?</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>

      <context></context>

   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Xander sits. When he swigs his coffee, he notices something written on his napkin in shaky ballpoint: "S.O.S." What the hell? He looks at the Trucker. The Trucker's staring at the waitress. QUICK PUSH TO: The Trucker has a BULGE underneath his vest... then PUSH TO: The Salesman's eyes darting about suspiciously, newspaper pulled up to his nose. Something is going down... He hears a SLOWED DOWN VOICE and glances back at the Trucker, who's now fixing him with a DEATH STARE. Xander snaps from his reverie.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah, sure.</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

      <utterance>With what? I said, go right on ahead with what?</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Trucker and the Salesman look at each other. Suddenly they jump up. The Trucker pulls a PISTOL from his vest, the Salesman brandishes the SHOTGUN he had behind the paper. The Waitress cringes.</context>
      <utterance>Whatever, dude.</utterance>
   <speaker>TRUCKER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Alright, nobody make a move!  Shoulda walked away when you had the chance, dumb shit.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>TRUCKER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She goes to open the register and knocks a tray of glasses on the floor. Xander springs into action. He CHOPS down on the Trucker's arm and ELBOWS him in the face. Xander twists the gun out of his hand and kicks his legs out from under him. The Salesman pumps on his shotgun, but it seems to be jammed.</context>
      <utterance>Keep your gotdam mouth shut and empty that register! Couldn't just let him leave, could ya! You know what I'm gonna do to ya for that? Huh? Do ya?!</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Salesman fights with his gun but can't get it to work. Xander advances on him.</context>
      <utterance>Better shoot me quick.</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He unleashes with a series of rapid front kicks to the jaw. The Salesman goes crashing through the kitchen doors. Xander turns to the terrified Waitress.</context>
      <utterance>Too late!</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She stares at him, unable to speak. He raises the gun.</context>
      <utterance>Alright, bitch, what's going on?</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The front door bell JINGLES. A guy with an impeccably tailored suit and a cane hobbles in. It's Gibbons. There a problem, Mr. Cage?</context>
      <utterance>Talk! What's the game? Who are you people?</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Who the hell are you?</utterance>
   <speaker>GIBBONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The name's Gibbons. You were saying?</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What is this place?</utterance>
   <speaker>GIBBONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Looks like a diner.</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He aims at the Waitress and FIRES! She's startled, but unhurt.</context>
      <utterance>Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&amp;K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "walked" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Xander tosses the gun on the counter. Gibbons gives a sly smile.</context>
      <utterance>Cuz there's nothing but blanks in these guns. And no offense, but their performances were terrible.</utterance>
   <speaker>GIBBONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Gibbons sits in a booth. Xander sits across from him. In the background the Waitress helps the Trucker and Salesman up.</context>
      <utterance>Not bad. Not bad at all. Have a seat.</utterance>
   <speaker>GIBBONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?</utterance>
   <speaker>GIBBONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.</utterance>

      <utterance>A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?</utterance>

      <utterance>Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.</utterance>

      <utterance>Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.</utterance>

      <context>Jefe goes into a fury. He SWINGS his machete at Xander's legs. Xander JUMPS UP, grabbing on to the chain above, and KICKS Jefe in the chest. Jefe falls back and Xander climbs up to the roof BEAM. He grabs onto the beam with his legs and UNHOOKS his chain from the meat hook. He drops down, six feet of chain still hanging from his cuffed wrists, and Jefe comes charging at him. Xander dodges a few wild swings. He grabs Jefe's PANT CUFF and dumps him on his ass. Jefe scrambles to his feet, drawing his PISTOL. Xander swings his chain and WHIPS the gun out of Jefe's hand. With another swing he WRAPS the chain around Jefe's neck and pulls it taught.</context>

      <context>Xander moves on, finds cover under the camouflage netting. He can see Narcos shooting into the trees at the UNSEEN ENEMY. Looking the other way, he spots Virg running back his way. He's been corralled by one of the Helicopters. He's zigzagging, trying to stay out of the beam of it's Night Sun. Xander darts out and GRABS him, pulling him under the camouflage netting.</context>

      <context>They jet off in opposite directions. Xander books, running for all he's worth. His cuffed hands and the dangling chain make it difficult. He's heading straight into the FIELD OF POT PLANTS. Suddenly the massive SPOTLIGHT picks him out.</context>

      <context>The CHOPPER swoops down after him. Its big GATLING GUNS turn, aiming right at him. BRAAAAAAAAPPP! The guns cut loose, tearing up the ground right behind him. Xander sprints, the chopper after him like Cary Grant in "North By Northwest", except instead of corn fields, Xander's running through a field of HUGE MARIJUANA PLANTS. Xander hits the deck and the chopper soars over him. Xander cuts over a couple rows and hunkers down amongst the plants. All around him it's a chaos of Helicopters and GUNFIRE. Two choppers attack the factory building, BLASTING it with their guns. Narcos run terrified. Xander notices a FAT PURPLE BUD on the plant right in front of him. He SNAPS IT OFF.</context>
      <utterance>Shit!</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>

      <context>We see ANDERS, the wild-eyed and unclean Swedish biker, against a backdrop of MOTORCYCLES and MUSCLE CARS.</context>
      <utterance>First we've got Anders, the psycho looking biker. In charge of transportation and smuggling. Controls every trucking union in Eastern Europe. Don't look too clean, either.</utterance>

      <context>Finally we see YORGI, the unlikely looking Mafiya Don. We see CRIME SCENE PHOTOS that illustrate his exploits.</context>
      <utterance>You like her, huh? Petra. She runs their finances, money laundering, computers. Joined the gang after spending some time as the girlfriend of this dude, Yorgi Azar Zimin. Capo of Anarchy 99.</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <context>Across the room, Xander sees a small window leading to the courtyard. He has to run across open ground to reach it. He calls out to Yorgi.</context>
      <utterance>Xander, my friend, that can only be you. Why don't we put our weapons down for a few minutes and discuss this like friends. How would you like to come to work for us instead? We could Rage Against the Machine together.</utterance>

      <utterance>Come on, you're the one who's fooling yourself. Why risk your life for your government when we can offer you a future that is truly free? Kirill is almost on top of him.

      <context>Kirill laughs and takes aim once again. He puts Petra in the sights. Xander jerks the steering wheel and BLAM! the shot goes wide. The GTO veers onto a dirt road that cuts down the mountain. Xander fights for control as they slide around the turns. The road flattens out and they can see the Industrial Complex up ahead. They cut across a field, heading right for it.</context>
      <utterance>Goddamit! He's gonna stop playing around soon and shoot something valuable!</utterance>

      <context>Petra punches another button. The REAR HUBCAPS pop off. They roll along the road on their own. Inside they seem to be LINED WITH SPIKES. As the Tactical pulls up in between the hubcaps they BLOW UP, SPRAYING SPIKES at both sides of the Tactical. All four wheels BLOW OUT and the Tactical goes out of control. It crashes through a fence and pitches into the water, the men going sprawling.</context>

      <context>At the riverbank Yorgi and Kirill pull Ahab off the truck and prepare for launching. They remove it from it's box and carry it waist deep into the water. Yorgi opens a panel and works feverishly on Ahab's insides.</context>

      <context>Kirill grabs his sniper rifle and heads off. He climbs up to a second story window of a wooden building on a WHARF. From here he can shoot and NOT BE SEEN. He takes his LIT CIGARETTE and tucks it behind his ear. When the GTO rounds the corner he FIRES. The bullet goes through the window and SLAMS into the steering column. Xander jams it into reverse. They retreat behind a building. Petra clutches her arm, wounded.</context>

      <context>Kirill chambers another bullet and waits for them to make their second approach. The GTO comes roaring out, spinning in circles wildly. Xander's is just doing donuts as fast as he can. Kirill aims, but with all the dust being kicked up he doesn't have much of a target.</context>

      <context>ANGLE ON - Ahab as Yorgi flips a switch and let's it go. The electric motor purrs to life and Ahab zips out into the river. Xander and Petra run to the water's edge in time to see Yorgi escaping in a MOTORBOAT. In the opposite direction they see the ripples of Ahab as it speeds towards it's destination. Petra finds the CONTROLLER in the cab of the truck. She presses buttons desperately.</context>

      <utterance>By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They're heading into downtown Prague now, the riverbank getting more and more populated. Yorgi is closing fast. Down below them Petra can see the white streak of Ahab beneath the water.</context>
      <utterance>Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!</utterance>
   <speaker>PETRA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Petra pulls the pin on a grenade. She tosses it out in front of Ahab. WHOOMPH! A jet of water goes up, but too far behind. She pulls another pin and is ready to throw when Yorgi's boat pulls up alongside. Yorgi aims and FIRES and the bullet GRAZES Petra's arm.</context>
      <utterance>There it is! Hold it steady!</utterance>
   <speaker>XANDER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She loses her grip and the grenade bounces down into the engine compartment. Xander grabs Petra and jumps. Together they land in Yorgi's boat. The grenade explodes and their boat slams into a bridge support and shatters. They are in the heart of the old city now. We see piazza's full of tourists, markets packed with locals, children playing in front of cathedrals. And on the river Yorgi and Xander battle it out while Petra steers the boat.</context>
      <utterance>Petra!</utterance>
   <speaker>PETRA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Xander glances down, sees Ahab nearing the surface. Yorgi clobbers him and Xander falls to the edge of the boat. Petra tries to help, but Yorgi slugs her in her wounded arm. Xander can see Ahab just a few inches under as Yorgi grabs him from behind in a chokehold.</context>
      <utterance>Xander! It's coming up!</utterance>
   <speaker>YORGI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Xander elbow's Yorgi's gut and breaks the chokehold. He flips him and they both topple overboard. They land on Ahab and both grab on. They punch and pummel each other while desperately hanging on to the speeding torpedo. It surfaces as it approaches the magnificent St. Charles bridge. On the bridge is a chaos of COPS, FIREMEN and CROWDS OF PEOPLE. They are desperately trying to herd people away from the river. Xander pounds Yorgi's face and dunks him underwater. Yorgi slips and falls back to the tail section, dragging along in the torpedo's wake. Ahab starts making noise and it's payload doors swing open. Inside Xander can see the row of glass cannister containing Silent Night. The first one rises up into FIRING POSITION.</context>
      <utterance>This is going to be exciting, buddy! Front row seats to the apocalypse! Come on, sing with me!  "I am an Antichrist / I am an anarchist / I... wan-na be... Anarchy!"</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>He pries the first rocket off it's launcher. The thing is BEEPING menacingly. IN SLO-MOTION - Xander blinks at the liquid death in his hands. He looks over at Petra. She's shouting at him, but he doesn't hear a thing but his own HEARTBEAT. He looks the other direction, to the mass of PEOPLE on the bridge above him. Total strangers... The fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former nihilist. Through the crowd, Xander sees Gibbons break through with his squad of Agents. Gibbons and Xander make eye contact. Then Yorgi lunges onto his back, trying to pull him into the water. Xander HITS BUTTONS on the control panel and Ahab starts to DIVE.</context>
