      <context>Steps back onto a A CHILD'S DOLL, crushing it underfoot. His ebullient mood changes quickly.</context>
      <utterance>Yes!</utterance>
   <speaker>KENNETH</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>The sound of footsteps are followed by the door opening. DELLA peers into the room. She's a diminutive blonde in her thirties with fine features and a fading Southern accent. She's pulling a coat on over a white shirt and jeans. She sees the broken doll.</context>
      <utterance>Damn! DELLA!</utterance>
   <speaker>DELLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She walks in, picks up the doll and tries to fix its squashed face. He turns back to the computer guiltily, takes a sip of beer.</context>
      <utterance>SHOOT, KENNETH! That's Tammi's favorite doll.</utterance>
   <speaker>KENNETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Close up, his face is ruddy - the face of someone who drinks too much. He turns back towards her. She ignores him, continues to try fix the doll. His eyes linger on her coat.</context>
      <utterance>You should just swear properly and get it over with. Do you think the kids don't know what you mean?</utterance>
   <speaker>KENNETH</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He averts his eyes back to the screen then turns back to look at her once more.</context>
      <utterance>Going out again? What is it tonight? Auto Mechanics for Dummies? The bored housewives' reading group?</utterance>
   <speaker>KENNETH</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He smiles sardonically.</context>
      <utterance>I got a new one for you.</utterance>

      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Kenneth clearly thinks he's funny. Della glares a warning at him and bites her lip to stop a vitriolic response escaping from her mouth.</context>
      <utterance>Group therapy for women who always have the curse. There's a Tuesday night class at the Pleasant Valley Episcopalian.</utterance>
   <speaker>DELLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A trail of kids mess in the hallway behind Della catches Kenneth's eye.</context>
      <utterance>I'm going to the mall for wrapping paper.</utterance>
   <speaker>KENNETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His sad eyes meet hers in confrontation. Della, determined not to engage, averts hers. Kenneth, unable to contain himself, faces her.</context>
      <utterance>What do you do all day, Della honey? Cause it sure isn't keeping house. This place is an eyesore. I'm mortgaged up to the eyeballs for this?</utterance>
   <speaker>KENNETH</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He lifts a strand of her limp fair hair and lets it drop, looks right in her tired face.</context>
      <utterance>I mean it's not like you're at some salon fancying up your hair or nails like the other men's wives.</utterance>
   <speaker>KENNETH</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>She bites her lip again, but this time to try stop the tears. He turns away, in an attempt to conceal his own sadness. She walks away clutching the doll.</context>
      <utterance>The last time I saw you wearing something sexy was our engagement party. God, Della, you used to be hot!</utterance>

      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>She smiles. Terri's already turned back to his dinosaurs. Tammi runs toward her and gives her the drawing she's been working on. It's a drawing of a stick figure family holding hands. The words "Mommy, we love you" are written across a cloudy night sky like big stars.</context>
      <utterance>I'll check in on you both when I get back.  To make sure you're sleeping.</utterance>
   <speaker>DELLA</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Della doesn't have time to look at it properly so she folds the drawing up and puts it in her pocket. She kisses Tammi again and turns to leave. Tammi's eyes follow her mother as she walks away.</context>

      <context>Vinh plods clumsily down the incline, followed by Tomas. Chuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch looking for a sign of Della. Chuckie shifts his focus to climb down the steep slope. As the light sweeps back across the gulch we catch a glimpse of Della between some rocks at the far side. But the boys' eyes are elsewhere, focused on the steep incline ahead of them. Della quickly ducks, draws her toolbox in tight and crouches low between the rocks. She watches the boys carefully as they climb down the gulch. There's the sound of a stumble followed by a splash.</context>

Chuckie keeps the flashlight slightly ahead of them. Della crawls stealthily between and behind the rocks, keeping as low as she can. Dodging the approaching light. The boys crawl across and up and between the rocks with the dexterity of animals. Della's so low she's scraping her knees and hands to shreds. She can see ahead where the rocks end and the trees begin. What was she thinking hiding here? It was too exposed.</context>

      <context>Chuckie tries to take the flashlight back from Vinh but Vinh won't give it. Chuckie doesn't persist. Vinh keeps going, shivering and blustering. Vinh senses something. He shines the flashlight behind the tree trunk. Still nothing. Sweeps back. Della darts between the evergreens behind them. She conceals herself in between the trunks and branches. Braces herself, waits for the right moments, the ones when they're not looking, to run between the trees. Cognizant enough to know they just want to find Tomas right now. She seems to be on autopilot, becoming numb as the minutes stretch on. She watches Vinh plod forward and through the brush. He hits every inch of it with the flashlight. Sighs. Doubles back to follow Chuckie. Then, the flashlight catches a glimpse of something. Sweeps back, illuminates Tomas's dead body, splayed out on the mud at the foot of the tree, eyes staring wide, bloody, ghastly. Tomas's Catholic cross pendant glimmers in the flashlight. Silence until Vinh falls to his knees in front of Tomas, tries to speak but only a whisper comes out.</context>

      <context>Her rocking slows until it stops. There's a loud crunch close by. She rises reflexively from the stream. Raises the toolbox. She looks around. A branch has broken from a tree and drags down into the stream behind her. This seems to bring her back to herself. She realizes it's only a matter of time before they come looking for her. She needs to get moving. She sets off downstream. She trudges through the shallow water. Her wet coat drags heavily. The stream must end somewhere, likely at the other edge of the woods. She trudges onwards, sweeping aside the branches of stooping trees, stepping around rocky obstacles in the stream. Forging ahead. She now needs to pee. GREAT. Her temper surges up. She looks for the right place to do it, realizes it's probably best to pee in the stream, so all trace of it will be dispersed. A leafless willow trails its dried up branches into the stream. She makes her way toward it. She lays the toolbox down and disappears between the branches. We see glimpses of her lifting her coat, pulling down her pants, pushing the crotch of her underpants to the side. We hear her shiver and the faint tinkle of water meeting the stream. More glimpses of her pulling up her underpants and pants, smoothing down her coat. She hoists her coat up again around her waist and picks up the toolbox. She plows down stream once more. Longing to see the light that will tell her she's at the edge of the woods, closer to the mall lights, closer to home. She swallows another wave of grief.</context>

      <context>This buys her a moment or two to get ahead. The stream bends right ahead. She opts to stay in it. Chuckie leaps out, runs along the banks, hoping to outrun and trap her. But the stream then bends left, giving her an advantage. He leaps back across the stream to the other side. But she's outrunning him. He charges back into the stream behind her. Della keeps on running through the stream, somehow trusting its direction. Vinh catches up with Chuckie. The boys are maybe twenty-five feet behind her. A SHOT rings out. Then a bullet races past her ear. Lodges in a tree just ahead of her. She almost loses her footing. She'd forgotten for just a moment, that they had a gun. Another shot blasts off into the night, skims her shoulder, hits the muddy bank of the stream. She flinches, braces herself, keeps going, adrenalin pumping harder than ever.</context>

      <context>Frustration breaks through his voice. She can see his shadowy form moving through the darkness towards her. He stops.</context>
      <utterance>And that's hot, hell yeah.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCKIE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Chuckie clicks on the flashlight, shines it straight ahead - right in between the plastic wrapped trees. Della freezes. They? Chuckie's eyes penetrate the darkness.</context>
      <utterance>And they're really cute.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCKIE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Della doesn't move. Terrified.</context>
      <utterance>Twins huh? Terri and Tammi.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCKIE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Della stares petrified as he unfolds her purse from deep in his jacket. He empties the contents out onto the dirt.</context>
      <utterance>I bet you could use that cigarette now Della honey?  A woman's purse can tell her whole life story!</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCKIE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Della wants to run at him so bad she almost hyperventilates. But she also knows that's what he wants and she refuses to give him the satisfaction. We move in closer on Chuckie. He's looking right at where she's hiding, pure malevolence hardening his face to a mask.</context>
      <utterance>Now I know where they are living, I'm thinking I may stop by after and say hello.</utterance>

      <context>Della crouches further in behind the felled trees. Why the hell did she shout? She could have been hiding anywhere. Now he must know for sure where she is.</context>

   <speaker>CHUCKIE</speaker>

      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Chuckie coughs, a dry laboured cough. He hocks long and deeply in his throat. But whatever it is he can't spit it out. He rubs his throat and collarbone gingerly.</context>

      <context>Chuckie reaches down, retrieves her diary from the dirt. She cringes.</context>

   <speaker>CHUCKIE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He coughs some more.</context>
      <utterance>So you bought into the big lie, even tried to live it. Who could blame you? Husband, kids, security, every woman's dream, but not yours, Della. You know there ain't no such thing as security.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCKIE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>She closes her eyes like she's seeing it all behind them.</context>
      <utterance>But I'm betting you didn't really know who you were until tonight. I reckon I know what you've been dreaming about though, what you've been aching for, through all these lonely, wasted years. Blasting out of Podunk without never looking back. Feeling the wind in your hair and the dirt of life between your fingers. Doing all the things they told you you ain't supposed to do. Taking what YOU want from life. And wasting anyone who stands in your way. Right, Della?</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCKIE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>A longing sigh sneaks out.</context>
      <utterance>Don't say you ain't thought about it. If it's in your blood, it's in your blood for all time.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCKIE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>A single tear runs down her cheek.</context>

   <speaker>CHUCKIE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>He sounds deadly serious, seductive even. She's lost in some kind of trance, looking like she just might believe him. Can she possibly be believing this?</context>
      <utterance>Hooking up with me's about the best chance you got.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCKIE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>She inhales sharply.</context>

      <context>She holds the breath in.</context>

      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Della exhales, responds. She seems lost to us.</context>
      <utterance>I can do it. Or you can if you're ready.</utterance>
   <speaker>DELLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But she doesn't finish the sentence. She rises slowly from between the plastic wrapped trees. A momentary grimace of pain crosses her face. Then, their eyes meet, like for the first time. It catches them both by surprise. He smiles.</context>
      <utterance>I want...</utterance>

   <speaker>DELLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>CHUCKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They stare at one another, all alone in the night. A knowing moment stretches between them. She notices the gash of matted blood and bruising on his collarbone.</context>
      <utterance>Shit happens.</utterance>
   <speaker>DELLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Chuckie smiles, brings his teeth back into a scary, feral grin.</context>
      <utterance>What now?</utterance>
   <speaker>CHUCKIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Della doesn't react. He brings up his hand, gun clutched, pointed and ready. Della surprises him and us.</context>
      <utterance>I wanted to look you in the eye before I kill you.</utterance>
   <speaker>DELLA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She nods her head, points her chin over his shoulder.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>He glances to the side for a split second, turns the gun as he turns his head. It's enough. Della slips the flare out of her pocket and opens it in his face. Before he even has time to react she LEAPS at him with all the spring left in her legs. Her fingers close around the wrist with the gun. The flare falls aside casting its fiery glow across them. She crashes her good shoulder into the spongy place where his collar bone is broken. It makes the ugly noise of sinew tearing.</context>

      <context>He pushes his mouth hard up against hers to stop her chin returning to the wound. She tries to pull away but he only presses harder. Neither can break away. It's unclear who's got the gun. They roll until she suddenly pulls away, sits up. But he has her and she has him in a fatal leg lock.</context>

      <context>They look at each other. He smiles. He makes for the gun. She fires into his chest, just once, it's enough. His legs release. He slumps back. Blood darkens his shirt. Gun smoke coils from the dark bullet wound. Blood seeps below him from the exit wound, spreading out in a dark puddle. His body surrenders to death. She stares down at him. A queasy silent moment passes. She stares at the gun in her hands. It feels so heavy, so unreal. His dead eyes stare. She reaches over and closes them gently. And she's light-headed, so light-headed she could just float away. Somehow she stands up. She looks back down at the body, not quite believing he could be dead. She sees her silver locket lying beside him in the pool of blood. She retrieves it. Uses her sleeve to wipe the blood away from its exterior. Inside the photos of her kids are still there; tiny photos of Tammis little thoughtful face and Terri's mischievous one look back at her. She snaps the locket closed. She searches the area for the rest of her belongings, finds her wallet, her purse, her diary, her lighter, her tampax box, a lipstick in the dirt. She sticks everything in her purse. She almost misses her pack of cigarettes. We see them half buried under the dirt. She scans the area once more finds them. The pack is empty but she takes it anyway. It's time to go home.</context>

      <context>She looks at her hands, they're ingrained with mud and blood. And her clothes! While waiting for the traffic to start moving again she fumbles on the passenger seat, finds some kleenex. She wipes her hands, her face, using the rearview mirror, some Kleenex and the rest of the water. She looks only slightly better. The line starts moving. Della follows. She passes the police cars, steals a cursory glance. She keeps checking her face in the mirror. The cars soon start to disperse in different directions. The Mall disappears behind her. She turns left onto an almost empty road. She can't wait to see her babies, make sure they're okay. How could anyone expect her to go the speed limit at a time like this.</context>
