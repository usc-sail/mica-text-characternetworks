      <context></context>
      <utterance>What d'ya say? Wanna run and get him for me? Still nothing. Jack frowns, takes out a cigarette, and pats his pocket for a match.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The kids' eyes widen at his profanity. Jack, the unlit cigarette dangling from his lip, ponders things for a moment, then flicks the'cigarette away and steps over the fence. At which point, the tinier of the two heads in the pool begins to scream.</context>

      <utterance>Hey, kid. Take it easy. No use. The kid's a world-class screamer. Frank, wearing baggy shorts and looking alarmed, comes racing out of the house.</utterance>

      <utterance>Sure, why not.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?</utterance>

   <speaker>FRANK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jack laughs coldly.</context>
      <utterance>I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead. The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>MONICA</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche. If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.</utterance>

      <utterance>Right.</utterance>

   <speaker>FRANK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Probably not, but Jack begins to play anyway, laconically picking out the cheery tune while Monica swings her arms and taps her foot. Despite all this, Monica still manages to come in between beats and Jack has to scramble over a chord to catch her, sort of like a fireman with a net.</context>
      <utterance>Well, shall we?</utterance>

      <context>As Monica exits, Jack and Frank glance at one another and thus begins a seemingly endless parade of aspiring singers who can't sing. As Frank sinks lower in his chair and Jack's ashtray spills over with wounded cigarettes, singer after singer, in all shapes, sizes, and colors, come forth to offer their own unique interpretations of "Feelings," "I Gotta Be Me," "This Is My Song," and perhaps most appropriately, "What Kind of Fool Am I." Finally, when it is all over, Jack and Frank are left alone in the tiny room, looking dazed, exhausted, and mildly homicidal.</context>

      <utterance>I get along without you very well Of course I do Except when soft rains fall And drip from leaves, then I recall The thrill of being Sheltered in your arms Of course I do But I get along without you very well.'

We may not know each other's names, we might not recognize one another on the street, but we know each other just the same. And over the years we've shared something. A little music, a little drink, a little laughter, maybe even... a few tears. But I guess that's what friends are for, huh? Applause. Jack puts out his cigarette.</context>

She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond. Applause. Susie strides out of the kitchen, past the busing station, and up to the microphone stand, which, unfortunately, is not on.</context>

The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it. Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all. Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability. Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.</utterance>

      <utterance>Of course, uh, back then it was, uh, a little different. We were just kids. Just about the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil. We must've shaved three lives off old Cecil, huh, Jack? Frank laughs and his voice, eerily magnified by the microphone, is the only sound in the room.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>How I used to stand in the kitchen, listening to the two of you practice while I did the dishes. (smiling) My two little radios. Sometimes I'd stop and go to the door and just watch.
