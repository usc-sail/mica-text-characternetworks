      <utterance>Marsh wasn't alone. We found traces of sperm on the sheets. The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.</utterance>

      <utterance>What'd he die of?</utterance>
   <speaker>MCCURDY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.</utterance>

      <utterance>The official cause?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>McCurdy enters the room. Cardenas thinks for a moment, then follows.</context>
      <utterance>It's speculative at this point. Marsh had advanced Arterial disease. His heart attack was induced by excessive aerobic activity -- in conjunction with the drug.</utterance>

   <speaker>MCCURDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A trace of a grin shows on Cardenas' face. He walks over to the window and stares outside. Reese, Troxell and McCurdy wait as he thinks. A beat. Cardenas turns back to the room.</context>
      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARDENAS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What can we prove?</utterance>
   <speaker>MCCURDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We know Marsh had a head cold. We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand. The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time. He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARDENAS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Any prints on the nasal spray?</utterance>

   <speaker>TROXELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What if he did know what was in it? A lot of users put it in nasal spray bottles so they can use it in public.</utterance>
   <speaker>MCCURDY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.</utterance>

      <context>Cardenas stands and walks to a DART BOARD on the wall. He gathers the DARTS, moves back and tosses one.</context>
      <utterance>A man across the street from Marsh saw her drive up about four thirty Sunday afternoon. And her prints are all over the place.</utterance>
   <speaker>TROXELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day. Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?</utterance>
   <speaker>CARDENAS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What did he say about Miss Lawson?</utterance>
   <speaker>TROXELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Cardenas throws another dart at the board.</context>
      <utterance>He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARDENAS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So she knew about his heart?</utterance>
   <speaker>TROXELL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Had to. I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh. There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARDENAS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What about the will?</utterance>

      <context>REBECCA LAWSON removes her hat and veil and slowly turns around. She is in her late twenties. A deep pain fills her face -- controlled, but evident. Her eyes are tired -- heavy from crying -- but no tears show now. This is a woman whose grief is private and not displayed for others. Although emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful. So beautiful that even Cardenas' usually cool demeanor cannot hide how impressed he is.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?</utterance>
   <speaker>SATTLER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.</utterance>

      <utterance>This trial by its very nature is explosive. The press is going to have a field day and I will not tolerate any activity in my courtroom that will fuel it.  Both of you are going to be delving into very personal aspects of peoples lives. I warn you now. When you do so -- if you cannot establish a clear line of relevancy early on in your examinations I will stop you. Is that clear?</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You all can see the defendant, Rebecca Lawson. But as this trial proceeds you will see that she is not only the defendant -- she is the murder weapon itself.</utterance>
   <speaker>43</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Cardenas walks back to the prosecution table and sits down.</context>
      <utterance>Is that possible? Can a person actually be a weapon? The answer is yes. If I hit you and you die -- I am the cause of your death. But can sex be called a weapon? Yes. And what a deadly weapon Rebecca Lawson made of it. The State will prove that Miss Lawson seduced Andrew Marsh -- that she put increasing sexual demands on him while she secretly administered cocaine. All the while knowing that he had a severe heart condition.  She is a beautiful woman -- but when this trial is over you will see her no differently than a gun, or a knife or any other instrument used as a weapon. She is a killer. And the worst kind -- one who disguised herself as a loving partner.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know what you're thinking -- and it's a mistake. You look at Miss Lawson and you see a beautiful woman who was involved with an older man -- and you think she looks like the type. She could've done it. And that's exactly what the District Attorney wants you to think. Yes, she is beautiful. So what? Does that make her a killer? Of course not. This case is not about appearances. It's about facts.  As Mr. Cardenas presents his case you will see that there are very few facts -- that the bulk of the States evidence is circumstantial. I'm confident that by the conclusion of this trial you will not just have a reasonable doubt. You will have no doubt at all -- that Rebecca Lawson is innocent of the charges against her.</utterance>

      <utterance>Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch. Do you?</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Maybe you don't know what it's like where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but I do. I came from a neighborhood just like hers. This is a whole other world for her. She's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people. So, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible.  Being poor and having pride is not a crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics.</utterance>

   <speaker>DULANEY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>The Prosecution's case is built on theory -- speculation. Could Rebecca Lawson have done this? Is it possible that she did that? Where are the facts? The evidence. The State has presented two spurned lovers and a jealous secretary. Hardly what I would call impartial witnesses. Where is one shred of conclusive, irrefutable evidence? I don't see it -- and I don't think you do either. Do you know why? Because there isn't any.</utterance>
   <speaker>94</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's the issue here? That Rebecca Lawson likes wild sex? No. But the District Attorney is trying to make you think if Rebecca Lawson could stray from the path of normal, accepted sexual behavior, then she could be capable of murder. Did she force Andrew Marsh to make love to her? Did she hold a gun to his head? No. Andrew Marsh wanted her -- and why wouldn't he? She's beautiful, alluring -- the type of woman men dream about. As Dulaney continues we sense he is applying his closing arguments to himself.</utterance>
   <speaker>DULANEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's human nature. We want what we want -- when we want it. We don't think about the consequences of our actions. When desire fills us we all do things that we know are bad for us. We live for the moment.  Here was an exciting young woman who unlocked doors. Doors that led into a new world. A world he entered willingly -- eagerly. He wanted to please her -- and so, he did not tell her of his illness. I know it might be difficult for you to understand wanting something so badly that you are willing to risk everything -- but that's what passion does to you. It's a fire -- uncontrollable. It consumes you -- and the only thing you can do is let it burn. Andrew Marsh let it burn. It was his life - - his choice -- and maybe his mistake -- but making love is not a crime.  We all have fires inside us -- secret desires. We guard them --hold them in the cages that we've built. When someone comes along and opens the gate, they rush out and feed blindly on their pleasure. Rebecca Lawson loved Andrew Marsh. She didn't kill him -- if anything did, it was his own passion.</utterance>

      <utterance>I've been thinking about that. I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance. You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.</utterance>

      <utterance>She's right, Paley. You've got to kill me. She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her. You supplied the Coke. You're an accessory to murder.</utterance>

      <context>Paley struggles to make a decision. The gun shakes in his hand. Suddenly, the whole scheme becomes clear to Dulaney.</context>

      <utterance>How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in. That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?</utterance>

      <utterance>Here's the good part. The truth dies with me and she turns State's evidence against you. It won't matter what you say. No one will believe your version -- you've already discredited yourself in court. You'll go away forever and she'll have the money all for herself. She's played us both perfectly. Paley is becoming more and more confused. Dulaney moves towards him. Paley lowers the gun slightly.</utterance>
