      <utterance>Yeah, a headache. My head hurts. You're making me uncomfortable.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm making you uncomfortable. Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you. But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes. Yes. That's exactly it. Yes.</utterance>

      <utterance>Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.</utterance>

      <utterance>You know what? I think you got Schwarzkopf. You did! You got the General right in the ass. Now that's good shooting.</utterance>

   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Think we're going to do it? Think we're going to war?</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not up to us. Up to the Iraqis. All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't think we'll go to war. We shouldn't even be here. This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict. It should be decided regionally.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>People are suffering.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>

      <utterance>People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As they pack up and get ready to roll on Jaeger says almost to himself:</context>
      <utterance>That's 'cause the Afganis weren't smart enough to be sitting on top of oil. People suffering is one thing, but when the Yuppies aren't going to have enough gas for their BMWs it's time to break out the tanks. Come on. Pack up. We've got a whole lot of nothing to patrol.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We ought to kick their asses. Either way we ought to.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone. It's considered offensive.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.</utterance>

   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm saying don't do it accidently.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jaeger lifts his leg and purposefully points the bottom of his foot at a vendor.</context>
      <utterance>Oh yeah. Accidently.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry. My foot accidently jumped up in the air where you could see the bottom of it. I hate it when that happens.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Come on. You're going to get us in trouble.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It was an accident. You saw it was an accident.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm just trying to help you guys out. It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Like learning Arabic? You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here. You don't learn it in a couple of weeks. I studied it in high school.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Spanish wasn't hard enough?</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I thought it would be good to know.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, if you ever need to buy a rug.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hey, Jaeger. Why don't you try this:</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't shoot me, I'm friendly. You can use that when you surrender.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How do you say "Come here, baby. I'm horny." I can use that now.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't even try it. You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't worry about Jaeger. He uses his personality as a form of birth control.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As Epps and Wes walk on Jaeger notices something on a VENDOR'S table. It is a small, square box - slightly larger than a man's palm - fashioned of wood and metal. It is not particularly ornate, but eye catching in its own way. The instant Jaeger picks it up and begins to look it over the Vendor is giving him the hard sell in Arabic. Jaeger holds the box up to the vendor.</context>
      <utterance>Blow me. Have I said that to you guys recently? Blow me.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>All he gets is more Arabic. Jaeger calls over to Wes.</context>
      <utterance>What is this?</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>Wes comes back over to Jaeger.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, Wes. Wes!</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What is this?</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now you need me.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wes looks over the box carefully.</context>
      <utterance>What is it? You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Can you eat it? If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wes says something to the vendor in Arabic. The Vendor answers back.</context>
      <utterance>Ask him what it is.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He says it's a box.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, you're funny.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's a puzzle box. If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>For real? A treasure?</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>There might be something in there.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>There might be.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And you're the guy who's going to open it.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I could.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Decisively, without even haggling about price, Jaeger whips out some money and pays the vendor for the box.</context>
      <utterance>You could turn on a light if someone put your hand on the switch.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>The three men walk on, Jaeger starting to work on the puzzle box.</context>
      <utterance>Well, that showed me. Now, can we eat?</utterance>

      <utterance>We're going to war, aren't we. If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jaeger goes back to his box. Wes stands over him for a beat longer, then:</context>
      <utterance>Okay, so we're going to war. We're supposed to go to war. We're soldiers, that's what we do. The guns, the tanks, the planes; you're just now getting the hint we're in the war business?</utterance>

      <utterance>The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over. The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth. Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box. I've got a treasure to find.</utterance>

      <context>Jaeger and Epps look out the front windshield. A plume of sand rises up from the desert several hundred meters before them. So engrossed in their discussion previously they hadn't even noticed until Wes pointed it out. Epps reaches over and kills the tape player. A loud quiet comes with it. All three men just stare at the plume as it drifts closer. Finally:</context>

   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Epps is right. Jaeger and Wes know it. They shut up and ride. Dig that tension: Wes sweating, Epps giving the wheel a white knuckle grip. Jaeger reaches down and readies his M- 16. When he chambers it, it sounds like thunder cracking. The plume draws closer and closer until it's not just a plume, but two dots. Then it's two jeep-like vehicles. Next we can even make out the passengers. That doesn't do much to relax our boys. Us, the Iraqis, we're almost on top of each other now. The vehicles are going to pass within feet. Epps throws in one more thing:</context>
      <utterance>It's the only way. We drive!</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>All three throw up some weak, forced waves. THE VEHICLES PASS. Look at that: The Iraqis are waving back. And that's all they're doing, just waving. Our boys break out into cheers.</context>
      <utterance>Wave at them. Don't look, just wave.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah! Yeah!</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>

      <utterance>You see that? Right by us. They went right by. You had them Epps; you called it.</utterance>

      <utterance>Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They all have a good laugh, but Wes brings that to a crashing halt. Looking back at the Iraqis, in a voice dead with fear:</context>
      <utterance>Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy. You're cool.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They stopped.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Wha...</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Epps and Jaeger look behind them.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>The two Iraqi vehicles have stopped, they've turned, and now they're racing towards our boys. Epps momentarily freezes. Jaeger helps him right out of it.</context>
      <utterance>They stopped, and they've turned around.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Epps punches it, and the Hummer takes off. The Iraqis are right behind them. The vehicles all do same hard driving: They twist and turn like wild snakes over the loose sand; hit dunes, take flight... It's the open desert, and our boys have nowhere to hide. Inside the Hummer it's a rough, rough ride. Our boys are thrown violently about the cabin. For Epps controlling the Hummer is about as easy as riding a wild horse. The Iraqis turn things up a notch and start sending gunfire our way. Bullets kick up around the Hummer like angry, little bees with a hell of a sting. Epps yells at Jaeger.</context>
      <utterance>Go, go, go!</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Now it's Jaeger who's freezes. Epps returns the favor.</context>
      <utterance>Shoot them!</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>Jaeger climbs back to the Humvee's machine gun, works the action and starts firing. Unlike before when he was playing, the real thing is much wilder. The Humvee bounces around like a cork in the ocean. Taking aim is nearly impossible. The best Jaeger can do is squeeze off rounds in the Iraqis' general direction. All Wes can do is cover his head, and stay down like a scared little girl.</context>
      <utterance>Shoot 'em!</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Steady it out!</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>It's like a dog fight in the dirt. The vehicles weave, cut... One of the Iraqis starts to cut across Jaeger's firing line. Jaeger swings the machine gun around hard and lets loose. A hail of bullets rips into the Iraqi vehicle just above wheel level. It kicks the vehicle up and back, whipping and twisting it horribly in the air time after time, then smashing it back into the ground. Jaeger is beside himself.</context>
      <utterance>I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As if in answer the remaining Iraqi vehicle's gunner tears off a salvo that eats up the space right around Jaeger. He's not hit, but it kicks him back down into the Humvee screaming with fear.</context>
      <utterance>I got him! You see that, I nailed him!</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The boys are running out of options, and Epps knows it.</context>
      <utterance>Damn it!</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>No good. Wes is too scared to move. Epps reaches back and literally pulls him up and over into the front.</context>
      <utterance>Wes, take the wheel.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>With little finesse Wes takes the wheel as Epps slides over. Epps takes up an M-16 with a grenade launcher. He loads it up, and readies the weapon. Crawling to the back he takes aim.</context>
      <utterance>Take it!</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>Wes does his best to give a level ride, but the Iraqi bullets coming at them don't help much. Epps zeroes in on the target. He takes aim and starts to squeeze back on the trigger. He almost has a shot off when Wes hits a dune rocking the Hummer violently. Epps loses the target.</context>
      <utterance>Keep it steady.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>Epps tries to take aim again. Careful aim. One shot is all he gets. The bullets keep coming, but he's in no hurry. Waiting...waiting... The Iraqis are only getting closer.</context>
      <utterance>Damn it! I said keep it steady.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Closer...</context>
      <utterance>Shoot...shoot! Waiting...</utterance>

      <utterance>Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North. Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.</utterance>

      <context>Our boys step past a grouping of rocks. They stop dead. Sitting before them, in what looks like a small camp, is FIVE IRAQI SOLDIERS. Time clicks by real slow for an instant. It's a delayed reaction, like the beat it takes after you pick up a hot pan before you realize that, yeah, it is burning the flesh from your hand.</context>

      <context>Our three soldiers turn and bolt back the way they came. They run like wild rabbits for a bit, jumping over a rock formation and hitting the deck using the rocks as cover. Like well-trained warriors they peel their weapons from their shoulders, lock and load, and stand ready. They wait a bit, taking several deep breaths like divers about to go under. Finally Epps gives the order.</context>
      <utterance>Take cover!</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>Simultaneously they spring up from behind the rocks and bear down on the Iraqis with their M-16s ready to blow them to kingdom come. One problem: No Iraqis. For a beat our three don't move. They hold position, breath coming hard like sprinters at the end of a race. They're eyes flint back and forth scanning for something...anything. There's nothing.</context>
      <utterance>Let's hit 'em!</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>M-16 still at the ready, Epps raises up taking a tactical stance. He inches forward, sweeping his weapon back and forth before him for any potential target. There is none. The Iraqis have vanished. Epps lowers the M-16, but does not shoulder it.</context>

   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>Wes and Jaeger come up from their cover and cross to Epps. They keep their weapons ready. Eerily they all look around as if trying to spot ghosts.</context>

   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There is a sound; a steady swooshing that starts faint and grows closer like a rolling thunder. Our three start looking around, turning where they stand, trying to find the source of the sound as it rises to a near deafening pitch. There's nothing. They see nothing. Still the sound races closer and closer. Epps, Jaeger and Wes raise up their weapons in preparation to defend themselves against this unseen beast. From below the edge of the mesa a HELICOPTER GUNSHIP - probably a MIL MI-24 HIND-D ARMED ASSAULT HELICOPTER if you want to be technical - raises up very dramatically into sight. It hangs in the air ominously before our soldiers. On board are the vanished Iraqis wearing nasty grins. The PILOT brings the gunship about and levels her massive machine cannons at our boys.</context>
      <utterance>What's weird is how they disappeared. Doesn't make sense. Doesn't...</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>Wes and Jaeger don't have to be told twice. They bolt from their spots, and not an instant too soon. The GUNNER lets fly a barrage of shells that literally tear up the ground where our boys were just standing. We see what the chopter's weapons will do to rock. We can imagine what they would do to flesh. Epps, Jaeger and Wes take cover behind some rocks. The gunship swings around, picks up speed and bears down on them. More shells fired. They punch into and through the rocks our boys use for cover. Again the three scatter, and just in time as the shells rip their way through the rock. Our three go sliding down an embankment, crouching low. Their heads whip around looking for the gunship.</context>
      <utterance>Scatter!</utterance>

      <utterance>Where the hell is it!?</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>In answer to Jaeger's question the gunship comes swooping up behind them like a bird of prey. Our three have all of about a second to get running before the Iraqis send more shells their way. They kick up chunks of rock as they ping, ping, ping around Epps, Wes and Jaeger who make a wild, evasive run. Dig it: Up ahead is a narrow passage through rock face. They race for it, hurl themselves into it as the gunship sends a special delivery of white-hot metal their way. Once inside the passage they have a bit of breathing space. It's too narrow for the gunship to get a good shot through. Our three press themselves up against the rock walls and suck air. Beyond the opening to the passage the gunship swings back and forth like a junkyard dog patrolling its kingdom. Jaeger's worked up a real scare.</context>

      <utterance>If they land--</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wes watches the gunship as it seemingly settles in the air. It floats very steady as if... Wes' eyes key in on something: The gunship's missile pods rotating slightly, coming in line... Wes' eyes go wide like someone just jammed an electric cattle prod in his ass.</context>
      <utterance>If they land, we can take them. If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Missile!</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Epps, Wes and Jaeger sprint for the opening at the far end of the passage as a missile rockets from the gunship's pod. With a wild whine it rides the wind like a deadly arrow straight into the passage. Slamming into the ground it sprouts a terrific fireball that rides on a massive explosion. It races through the passage, lifts our boys from the ground and tosses them out into the open like they were nothing more than discarded ragdolls. Jaeger takes cover and cowers. He puts his panic into overdrive. Wes pulls his rifle. Grunting like an animal he sprays bullets at the chopter, but it's like throwing snowballs at an elephant. The gunship turns on Wes and fires in his direction. It doesn't hit him, but it sends him running. Epps has had enough of this shit. He scrambles to load a grenade in his launcher as the gunship comes about. It races for him, cannons at the ready. This one is going to be close. Epps locks and loads just as the chopter swings down on him. Epps fires, but the gunship simply jukes up and away from the grenade the way someone might step over a bug. The grenade impacts the rock face behind the chopter exploding harmlessly. The chopter returns the favor by reining down a hail of shells that kicks Epps back FLIPPING HIM UP AND OVER the edge of the plateau. His M-16 goes flying, smashing into the ground far below. Epps manages to grab hold of the plateau lip with one hand. It swings him around, slamming him hard against the cliff face. He hangs there, suspended by his weakening grip, far above the ground.</context>
      <utterance>Move!</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jaeger and Wes run to him, grabbing him by his arm. They pull and pull hard until Epps can get some kind of purchase, and crawl his way back up to the plateau. At the same time the gunship lowers itself so that it hovers above and beyond our three. It rotates so that the bay doors are facing Epps, Wes and Jaeger. Three Iraqis are inside, weapons trained on our targets. One of them yells something. Wes translates.</context>
      <utterance>Epps!</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The three share a nervous look. Epps fairly growls:</context>
      <utterance>They want us to surrender.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jaeger and Wes watch as, shielded by their bodies, Epps palms a grenade from his belt. Wes and Jaeger don't quite smile, but they know now they at least have a chance. As Epps stands the other two turn to face the Iraqis. They all fold their hands behind their necks which, for Epps, hides the grenade from view. Slowly they walk towards the gunship. One of the Iraqis starts to yell something. He lifts his weapon and aims it at our boys. With his thumb Epps yanks the pin from the grenade and lets fly. It's a perfect toss, landing in the chopter's bay. The Iraqis see the grenade land, they scramble for it. One of them grabs it up and is about to throw it back out of the gunship. Too late. The grenade explodes in the Iraqi's hand killing him instantly. It also touches off a fire ball that severely damages the gunship. It rocks, lists, spins wildly out of control.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah, I'll surrender.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>Our three hug the ground as the chopter's rotors go whipping through the air like throwing knifes landing perilously among them. Worse still the gunship, now a lame bird, drops from the sky towards Epps, Jaeger and Wes. All they can do is cover their heads, as if that would do any good against two tons of crashing steel. The chopter rushes down...down, but it just misses them. It slams into the ground skipping over the edge of the plateau, to the rocks below. Our three pick themselves up. They walk to the edge of the plateau and look down on the crash. Jaeger, scared painted all over his face, sinks to his knees and looks as if he's about to go into shock.</context>
      <utterance>Get down!</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>

      <context>Epps spins. Like a bolt of lightning he's on Jaeger, grabbing him up and pulling him close.</context>
      <utterance>What's the point? There's nothing here. The map's a fake. Christ, even I see that now. We're just wasting our time. We might as well give up and--</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Epps pushes Jaeger back and he goes down to the ground hard. A fire burns inside him. A fire that burns out of control. Before he even knows what he's doing Jaeger springs to his feet, shovel in hand, bringing it down in a long arc for Epps' head. Epps bears him coming. He deftly side steps the blow, grabs hold of Jaeger and forces him down. They roll around violently like wild dogs trading blows and trying to work the other into a choke hold.</context>
      <utterance>You listen to me. The whole reason we're here is because of you and that map of yours. I didn't do all this for nothing, and I'm not leaving with nothing. If you think for a second I'm giving up just 'cause you're too tired to turn over some dirt, then you don't know John Epps too well, do you? So you dig, and you keep on digging 'til I say you don't have to dig anymore.</utterance>

      <utterance>I feel air. Probably opens up outside somewhere. That's where the light comes from. Couldn't see it with the lanternon.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>That's all Epps needs to hear. He starts clawing at the opening with his bare hands. That gets him nothing. Grabbing up a shovel he starts to whack at it.

      <mode></mode>
      <context>The rock gives way enough for Epps to pry it free. There's just enough space for a man to reach his arm through. For a beat Epps and Jaeger just stare at the opening almost afraid of what mayor may not be in there. With some trepidation Epps begins to move his hand towards the opening. Slowly it extends closer...closer... Just as it moves beyond the opening. vThere is a wild, screeching hiss as some small, hairy thing leaps for Epps. Both Epps and Jaeger recoil, Jaeger going nuts with fear.</context>

      <context>Too late. Jaeger squeezes off a few rounds. A couple of bullets hit the thing, but the rest ricochet wildly about the cave and around Epps and Jaeger. All the two men can do is duck and cover - squeezing themselves into tight, fetal balls - as the bullets scream back and forth like little chunks of random death. Eventually the bullets lose speed and die off. Jaeger and Epps raise up off the ground. They walk to the dead thing that jumped from the opening.</context>

A few beats later the rope comes snaking back down from, above. Epps brings over the pack of gold and attaches it to the rope. Yelling up:</context>

   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wes moves menacingly for the Iraqi. He thrusts his M-16 forward. Epps grabs it, and throws a punch. Unlike before with Jaeger, this time Wes ducks the blow and swings the butt of the M-16 back at Epps. It's not much of a blow though, and Epps keeps on coming. He barrels into Wes and takes him down. As the two men tussle the Iraqi sees his chance to get away. He springs up, knocking Jaeger to the side, and bolts past him.</context>
      <utterance>Shut up! Shut the hell up!</utterance>
   <speaker>JAGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Epps turns and sees this. Maybe he's not for killing this guy, but he certainly can't just let him get away. He takes off running after the Iraqi, Jaeger a step behind. The Iraqi, face flush with fear; eyes filled with terror like a hunted animal, makes it to the rock face and starts to climb to the plateau above. He knows if he can make it he at least has a chance of getting away. It shows in the desperation he climbs with. Epps and Jaeger are right behind him. They claw at the rocks, but can't gain ground. The Iraqi gets closer and closer to the plateau; to freedom. Our two soldiers scramble up right behind him. The Iraqi gets a hand on the lip of the plateau. He's just about to pull himself up. He's just about to get away-- WE HEAR A SHORT BURST OF GUNFIRE. Three large, bloody holes mushroom open in the Iraqi's back.</context>

      <context>Epps isn't even paying attention, he's just walking on. Almost, as if he senses something is wrong, he stops in his tracks. He looks down at his feet and sees the most curious thing. SAND IS RUSHING AWAY FROM HIS FEET, ALMOST AS IF IT'S GOING DOWN A DRAIN. He looks at it with the same wonderment that a dog watches television.</context>
      <utterance>You saw how he ran didn't you? First chance he got he ran out. Would have gone straight to his CO, told him all about the gold. What do you think would have happened then, huh?

Watch and see if I don't get a medal.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Epps has got all of about two seconds to ponder this as a moment later the Earth literally drops from beneath his feet. He's standing on a sink hole that opens up swallowing him in loose sand. Immediately he sinks to waist level. He slows there, but still goes down with rapidity. He screams to Jaeger and Wes.</context>
      <utterance>What the hell...?</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>

      <context>Jaeger is paralyzed by indecision. He doesn't want to let Epps drown, but if he gets too close he could easily get sucked into. He flirts back and forth between rescue and safety. Sand continues to pour in on Epps.</context>

   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>Jaeger can't fight himself any longer. He lowers himself halfway into the hole, stretching spread eagle trying to keep some kind of grip on the firmer ground, and reaches for Epps. Their arms twist and strain for each others. First their fingers meet, then they grab hands. They work a grip down to their wrist, but that's all they can get. Jaeger strains like a field horse pulling Epps against the sand. It may not be enough as he begins to slip down himself. Jaeger twists his head and looks up at Wes. Straining to say anything he pleads:</context>
      <utterance>For Christ's Sake, Jaeger! Help me! Help me!</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His words fall on deaf ears. Wes just takes a step closer to the pack of gold coins. This only serves to energize Jaeger. He digs deeper within himself finding an untapped reserve of strength. He grunts and pulls, the veins on his neck puffing like balloons. Epps finds same purchase. He pulls, swims, his way up from the sand. A little at first, but like hitting shallow water he's able to lift himself up. Jager jerks him the rest of the way up to firm ground. They collapse, chests heaving like pistons as they suck air. As Epps regains strength he pats himself down. Suddenly he goes back into a panic.</context>

      <context>Epps rolls back over and thrusts his hands down into the soft sand frantically looking for the lost computer. Jaeger joins in. They dig and scrape as best they can, but daring to venture only so far into the soft sand. It doesn't matter. The navicom is lost.</context>

      <context>Wes is just about to squeeze back the trigger when a shot rings out. Wes' body jerks like he's just been hit in the back with a truck. The way cut timber falls he slams to the ground motionless. Epps and Jaeger stare at the body for a beat, then snap their heads in the direction of the shot. Up on a dune behind them are a group of SHI'ITES on horseback. One of them has a high powered rifle which he has just used to drill Wes. He fires another shot. It pings to the ground between Epps and Jaeger. Our two remaining men scramble. Jaeger dives for the gold and snatches it up from the ground as bullets zip around it. The two take off running as best they can in the sand. They run wildly, erratically, without looking back. They run until their bodies scream no more, then keep going on inertia. Reaching a dune they tumble down the far side and collapse in a heap at the bottom. They take a moment to catch what breath they can, then:</context>

      <utterance>We're lost, you understand that? We've got no navicom, and no means to find a way back. So right now I don't give a damn about the gold because if we don't get off this desert, and out of Iraqi all it's going to be good for is buying us tombstones.</utterance>

And listening to sob stories from some about how the system wasn't good to him because he had to work like everybody else instead of being born a Kennedy doesn't do a damn thing to help keep me alive.

      <context>Before Epps can even finish getting the word out machine gun fire erupts from the house and burns towards Epps and Jaeger. They dive for cover, hugging the ground as bullets whistle and ping through the space around them. They are forced back and down against a narrow stretch of rock, but it offers little protection and is chipped away by the hot lead.

      <context>Jaeger whips around at the same time pulling his M-16. He jerks back hard on the trigger spraying back and forth, back and forth. Dig it: The Iraqis do a death dance in the strobe light of the muzzle flashes. They do the twist, they do the jerk, then they all fall down. The bullets that miss do a nasty job of redecorating the place; shredding walls, eating up wood. Jaeger keeps firing until his clip is empty. He stands huffing, eyes glazed like he's a million miles away from what he just did. Epps steps up and takes the weapon from Jaeger. That's like an alarm clock that brings Jaeger back to the land of the living. Jaeger takes one look around at all the carnage, then doubles over and gets to puking. Epps just watches this pathetic sight. When Jaeger is all done:</context>

      <context>As Jaeger gathers up what water he can find, creeps for the door. With the muzzle of his gun he pulls it open a crack and peers out. Still nothing. It's like the man vanished into thin air. Jaeger, stocked up on water, comes over with the gold and Epps' pack which Epps shoulders.</context>
      <utterance>Sun rises in the East. We go the opposite direction. May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.</utterance>

      <context>Jaeger nods. Epps opens the door, and the two men carefully snake their way out weapons at the ready. It seems, though, there is nothing to be ready for. There is no one around. Suddenly the man appears from around the shack. Epps and Jaeger turn on him targeting with their assault weapons, but they do not fire. The man just stands. He doesn't say anything, he makes no threatening moves. The three stay still as statues for several beats until Epps jerks his head indicating to Jaeger they should move on. That they do, weapons still on the man, until they are beyond his range. They walk on a little ways. Jaeger spots something, and thrusts a finger in its direction.</context>

   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mounted on a horse, riding on a dune that runs parallel to them, is ANOTHER ARAB MAN. He makes no effort to draw nearer to Epps and Jaeger, but nor does he lose them.</context>

      <context>As if to be contrary to Epps' statement ANOTHER TWO ARABS ON HORSE BACK appear up over a dune before them.</context>
      <utterance>We keep going, that's what we do. We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Epps doesn't know, and he doesn't want to find out. They change direction heading away from the Arabs. But again MORE ARABS ride up over a dune. Epps gets the feeling he and Jaeger are about to be boxed in.</context>
      <utterance>Jesus! How many of them are there?</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Epps breaks into a run. Jaeger is only steps behind him. Like something out of an old John Ford western dozens of mounted Arabs suddenly appear over a dune. They ride fast and hard for Epps and Jaeger like Apaches heading for a wagon train. They easily overtake our two, momentarily swallowing them amongst the thundering hoofs, and ride on a bit as if playing with them. Epps and Jaeger stop, then bolt in the other direction. The Arabs ride back, again past Epps and Jaeger swiping them to the ground; the horses kicking up a spray of lose sand over them. It looks like a cattle round up, and our two are the cattle. Epps and Jaeger get up to make another run of it, and again the Arabs bear down on them. This time they mean business. They completely surround them, cutting off all means of escape. The Arabs start screaming something back and forth in Arabic. We don't know what, but it sounds unpleasant. Epps and Jaeger come skidding to a halt. They turn in their tracks digging in the scene. It goes like this: They are completely outnumbered and out gunned by a mounted force. Doesn't get any simpler. Epps and Jaeger drop their weapons. Their hands go in the air.</context>

      <utterance>When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic. Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war. They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs. They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy. America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out: They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert. They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost. It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.

   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wes very calmly says something to the Shi'ite. The Shi'ite just stands there for a beat looking at the three men, then suddenly explodes in screams. No way of knowing for sure what he's saying, but since he's going off like a Westec alarm it's a pretty good bet he's been tipped of. Epps rears back a fist and slams it into Wes' face.</context>

   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>Epps and Jaeger take off running for the horses, practically leaping into the saddles as Shi'ites come pouring out of their tents. Forgetting himself, Wes screams in English.</context>
      <utterance>Bastard!</utterance>
   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jaeger and Epps spur their horses and take off riding hard. It's amazing what you can do when a bunch of angry Shi'ites are chasing you. Wes grabs an assault weapon from a near by Shi'ite and mounts up with blood in his eyes. He leads a charge of armed, mounted Shi'ites that looks like a posse going after some bad men. Out front Epps and Jaeger pull up for a second.</context>
      <utterance>Stop them!</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Epps takes a look behind him. He can't hardly miss the sandstorm Wes and the Shi'ites kick up as they ride for them.</context>
      <utterance>They coming?</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Epps points off to some foothills in the distance. It's the only thing close to cover for miles around.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, yeah. They're coming.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>They take the reigns to their horses and get to riding. Behind them Wes yells to his riders, and signals for them to split up, and try to cut off Epps and Jaeger. Epps and Jaeger hit the hills. They ride up for a bit, then stop to spot Wes. Wes and his crew are better riders and have closed the gap. All the two can do now is try to lose them in the terrain. Epps and Jaeger ride as best they can, and somewhat erratically to cover their trail. They head up a ways, then cut across in a parallel direction. Jaeger looks back, but sees no sign of Wes.</context>
      <utterance>Ride for the hills. We'll try to lose them.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Just as the words leave Jaeger's mouth a hail of bullets explodes the ground before them. Their horses rear up, and it's all they can do to fight them. Just ahead are the Shi'ites who split off from Wes, having circled around Epps and Jaeger. The two yank their horses back, and ride hard in the opposite direction with the Shi'ites just behind. They fire on Epps and Jaeger, the bullets pinging off the rocks all around them. Epps and Jaeger are little more than passengers on their horses as they run wild like stampeding mustangs. And good for it, too, otherwise they might be dead by now. They break for a trail that leads further up the mountain, but it does little to shake loose their pursuers. As Epps and Jaeger level out they can see the trail below them, and Wes and his posse riding for them. Our two start back the way they came. but the other Shi'ites crest the hill.</context>
      <utterance>We lost them!</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>Epps looks from side to side. Either way is certain death. Then he looks off towards an embankment. It is VERY steep. VERY treacherous. It would take an expert rider to make it down the embankment safely. All Epps knows is there aren't any gun totting Shi'ites in that direction.</context>
      <utterance>Which way?</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Which way do we go!?</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Fear gives way to desperation. Both men whip their steeds hard. The beasts leap to the embankment and start the wild ride down. Both Epps and Jaeger have to lean back in their saddles until they're almost parallel to the ground just to stay on their horses. Wes sees this and swears. He signals to his men to cut back the other way. Epps reaches the bottom of the embankment. Jaeger is almost there when he looses control of his horse. Both rider and animal go tumbling in an ugly fall.</context>
      <utterance>We go this way.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>The horse gets up and bolts off before Jaeger can get to her. Just then Wes and his men make it back down the trail, and start riding hard for Jaeger. Epps pulls his horse around and takes off for his fallen comrade. As he rides in he leans to the side and low. Stretching out an arm Epps literally scoops Jaeger, and swings him up behind him. A couple of rodeo performers couldn't have done it better. Problem is with the extra weight they can't go very fast. Wes and his men close hard now. The bullets fly fast and furious swarming all around our boys. Epps whips the horse, trying to get everything she's got to give. This is it: They get away now, or not at all. Their horse finds a little something extra. She goes faster, faster... Suddenly Epps pulls up hard on the reins. The horse rears up, she goes wild. It takes everything Epps has to control her. But better that than if she'd taken another stride. They've come to the edge of a very, very sharp cliff. Epps may be a good rider for a novice, but no way he could get this beast to fly. Finally he calms the horse down, but it doesn't matter. Wes and the Shi'ites ride up behind them cutting them off. Wes stands down from his horse. Epps and Jaeger, with nowhere to go, do the same.</context>

   <speaker>WES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Epps has got no choice, really. He tosses the pack to Wes' feet who stoops to pick it up. Wes starts to open the pack.</context>

   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Wes rips open the pack. He's got about one second to see what's inside. NO GOLD. JUST A BOOBY TRAPPED CLAYMORE MINE. Epps grabs Jaeger and yanks to him to the ground. There is a horrific furry of sound and fire that easily destroys Wes and a few of the Shi'ite standing next to him. The rest, along with the horses, scatter for dear life. Epps stays down until the coast is clear, then gets up. Jaeger, to say the least, is stunned.</context>

      <utterance>Thought you were going to buy a car.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Still am. There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now... Where should I go?</utterance>

      <utterance>I've never been anywhere. I wouldn't know where to go. Where would you go?</utterance>

      <context>Another long beat. Still no car.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>What?</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'd go to Australia. Lot of land, not many people. I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile. And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Really?</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>From the distance we hear the faint sound of a car motor. It draws closer and closer. Epps and Jaeger stand. Knowing they're so close to the end of a long adventure they become very business like.</context>
      <utterance>That's what I hear. Don't matter. Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, this is it. We get the car, find some Americans. We find Americans we'll be all right.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Epps and Jaeger just stand staring at each other as the car draws closer.</context>
      <utterance>We'll make up some kind of lie. They won't find the gold.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jaeger goes out and lays in the car's path. Epps goes to hide behind some rocks. The car keeps getting closer and closer. Jaeger yells over to Epps.</context>
      <utterance>Okay. See you in a minute.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The car gets closer.</context>
      <utterance>He'll slow down.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's not slowing.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The car gets closer.</context>
      <utterance>He's going to slow down.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The car barrels right for Jaeger. Forget what Epps says, it's not slowing down and Jaeger knows it.</context>
      <utterance>Epps...Epps!</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>At the last possible second Jaeger rolls out of the way. The car doesn't slow, tearing across the stretch of road where Jaeger lay, but swerves to avoid him. The DRIVER loses control for a few seconds and is forced to skid to a halt. Epps runs to the car, rips open the driver's door, and presses the muzzle of an assault weapon to his head.</context>
      <utterance>Aw, damn!</utterance>

      <context>Jaeger runs over and jumps in the car. Epps gets in behind the driver, keeping the gun pressed to his head.</context>

      <utterance>What's in the other direction?</utterance>
   <speaker>DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Turn the car around.</utterance>
   <speaker>DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Please, I beg of you. The American army is there. I am Iraqi. They will kill me.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Epps takes a gold coin from his back and gives it to the driver.</context>
      <utterance>Nobody's going to hurt you.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>The driver turns around the car and starts back in the direction he came. They drive on for awhile, mostly in silence. Epps and Jaeger are too anxious to have this all over to say much, and the driver is too scared. Finally the driver starts to talk.</context>
      <utterance>You see that? Gold. You take us to the Americans, and we'll give you another one. Now drive.</utterance>
   <speaker>DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Neither Jaeger or Epps answer.</context>
      <utterance>You are Americans, yes?</utterance>
   <speaker>DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>Still Jaeger and Epps say nothing. Outside the car the traffic flowing in the opposite direction gradually gets thicker and thicker.</context>
      <utterance>We didn't not all want this war, do you know? We didn't not all want to invade our brothers and sisters in Kuwait. Now your army crushes us. So few days, and so many have died. And many fear we will all die. Please tell this to your people: We did not want this war.</utterance>
   <speaker>DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode>CONT</mode>
      <context>This last bit gets to Epps.</context>
      <utterance>I have a brother in our army. When I take you back, will you look for him? If he is still alive, will you look for him and take care of him?</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Outside the traffic away from Kuwait has gotten so thick everything is at a stand still. There are Iraqi military vehicles pulling out, as well as a good many civilian cars and trucks. It clogs up both lanes, and envelopes the car. Some people try to make their way on foot as it is now much faster.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah. We'll look for him.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look at this.</utterance>
   <speaker>DRIVER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Iraqis. They are fleeing from Kuwait, from your military.</utterance>
   <speaker>EPPS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The driver tries to work the car free of the congestion, but he's wedged in, and not going anywhere. From out of the sky swoop down a flight of AMERICAN F-15E FIGHTER JETS. They swing down on the far end of the highway, engines roaring like angry lions. For a second time stands still. Everyone on the road stops and looks up at the jets. Time starts again, and with a deadly vengeance. The fighter pilots begin to strafe the highway: Vehicles and people, civilian and military alike. There is no distinction, only carnage. This is the infamous Al Jahra highway from Basrah to Kuwait City that was strafed with deadly accuracy over and over on the last day of the war by American forces. It became known as the Highway of Death. The huge shells rip a bloody path, shredding cars and trucks, igniting explosions, straight towards the car with Epps, Jaeger and the driver. With barely seconds to go before they are shot to pieces as well. They dive from the car, Epps dragging the driver out, and scramble for cover along the side of the road. The planes turn back for another pass.</context>
      <utterance>See if you can't drive around this.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Not even thinking about what he's doing Jaeger jumps up and screams at the jets.</context>
      <utterance>What the hell are they doing? There're civilians in there.</utterance>

      <utterance>The gold!</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jaeger lunges for Epps but misses him. Epps snakes his way through the burning hulks towards their car. He dodges, jukes and weaves among shells, shrapnel and explosions that go off all around him. He just makes it to the car, grabbing up the gold, as the fighters once again swing low and cut loose. A wicked hail of shells reigns down. It sets off a series of violent explosions that knocks Jaeger off his feet. It takes him a beat to recover. By then the fighters have done their job, and fly off. Jaeger stands. He walks towards the road over the plaintive wails of the barely living. The car, the gold, Epps... they are essentially disintegrated.</context>
      <utterance>No!</utterance>

   <speaker>CHIEF JUSTICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jager doesn't stand. He doesn't look at the tribunal. He just begins to talk.</context>
      <utterance>The members of this tribunal have reached a verdict. Based on the evidence presented we find the defended guilty as charged of desertion, insurrection, insubordination, and conduct unbecoming. Further the tribunal will recommend that the defendant be sentenced to life imprisonment, and that from this day forward he shall no longer walk as a free man. You should consider yourself quite fortunate, son. There was a time when lesser crimes would have found you before a firing squad. I don't know that a person like you has much to say for himself, but it is your right say something.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry, I guess. Not for looking for the gold, or leaving my post. You know what it's like to have gold raining out of your hands? That'll give me enough to think about the rest of my days in the brig. I'm just sorry about Wes. He was all right. It was the gold that made him what he became. If I hadn't found that map, if I hadn't talked them into going searching...Wes just might have made it home after all. I guess I feel responsible for him.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHIEF JUSTICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The way I view things you're responsible for the lives of two men: Private First Class Wes Hanmond, and Second Lieutenant John Epps.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The members of the tribunal just scoff.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah, well, I've been thinking about that. See, there was an explosion and everything, but I never really aaw Epps get killed. And nobody ever found the gold. I guess they both could have been burned to slag. I guess. But there were a lot of bodies out on that road. A smart man could have found some identification to use. A smart man could have made his way up to Syria or Turkey. A smart man could have gotten himself right out of the Middle East. A smart man with enough gold. Way I figure, right about now old Epps is sitting in a bar in Sydney, or Melboure, or maybe Brisbane telling stories to one of the prettiest Aussies you ever saw.</utterance>
   <speaker>CHIEF JUSTICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I find it highly unlikely that anyone could accomplish such a thing.</utterance>
   <speaker>JAEGER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jaeger allows himself a slight smile as he leaves the tribunal with this question.</context>
      <utterance>Well, Sir, I guess you don't know Second Lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?</utterance>
