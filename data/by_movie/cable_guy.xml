      <utterance>Horrible. The cable guy is missing in action. Apparently he's going to be here sometime between eight AM and my death.</utterance>
   <speaker>RICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Please tell me you didn't call her.</context>
      <utterance>You haven't called Robin have you?</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, I'm giving her space.  I can't believe she's doing this.</utterance>
   <speaker>RICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You never should have asked her to marry you. You're the mad smotherer.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All she had to do was say no. She didn't have to kick me out. I feel like Felix Unger.</utterance>
   <speaker>RICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You forced her to evaluate the relationship. If you didn't propose she would never have realized how unhappy she was.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>So what time are you going to come by?</context>
      <utterance>I don't want to talk about it.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I can't. I'm working double shifts the rest of the week.</utterance>

      <utterance>It's my first night here. Don't do this to me.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The other camera guy pulled out his back. Besides, I spent the last two weeks with you on my couch. Isn't that enough?</utterance>

      <utterance>Fine, fine.</utterance>
   <speaker>RICK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>One piece of advice. Slip the cable guy fifty bucks, he'll give you all the movie channels for free. Even the dirty ones.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I couldn't. I'm not good at that stuff. What if he says no? I'll feel like an idiot.</utterance>
   <speaker>RICK</speaker>

      <context>Steven hangs up, and waits.</context>
      <utterance>None of them say no, believe me. I'll talk to you later.</utterance>

      <utterance>No, they go to me. I'm a perfectioniss perfectioniss  perfectioniss t. Now let's take a look at what we're dealing with.</utterance>

      <utterance>In preparing your service I noticed you were previously wired across town at 1268 and a half Chestnut. Last week the billing was transferred to one Robin Harris. Smells like heartbreak to me.</utterance>

      <context>A video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and his twin brother at various ages. Included is the cast photo of "Double Trouble." Pictured in the photo are eight-year- old Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad. We see a brief clip from "Double Trouble," starring the two eight-year-old boys, then a shot of Sam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs.</context>
      <utterance>So ends day fifty-four of the trial of former child star Sam Sweet who has been accused of shooting his twin brother, Stan, in cold blood. The twins were stars of the hit sitcom "Double Trouble" which aired from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen eighty-four.</utterance>
   <speaker>RIKKI KLIEMAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Life wasn't so sweet after the cancellation of their program. Hollywood chewed them up and spit them out. A frustrated Sam turned to petty larceny, while his more impressionable brother, Stan, fell in with a fringe cult called "The Brotherhood of Friends." Reduced to tabloid fodder a fury was growing inside of Sam. A burning need to be recognized as an individual, not a person famous for having an identical twin. A need that took the form of four shotgun blasts on the night of November fourteenth. And so today his attorneys continue the unusual defense of "Twin Envy."</utterance>

      <context>The Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say "quiet." His eyes never leave the TV.</context>
      <utterance>How's it going?</utterance>
   <speaker>CABLE GUY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Steven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the room impractical for anything other than watching television. The TV is now on the stairs blocking the entrance into the living room. All furniture faces the TV, making conversation impossible.</context>
      <utterance>Guilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. I hope they fry this bastard.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What happened?</utterance>
   <speaker>CABLE GUY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Is that cool?</context>
      <utterance>The arrangement of your major appliances and your furniture was causing some noisy pics and hum bars in your reception. I moved a few things. Cleared it right up.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I guess so.</utterance>
   <speaker>CABLE GUY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at each other. As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him.</context>
      <utterance>You programmed?  Then let me slave your remotes.</utterance>
   <speaker>CABLE GUY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Ooh, maybe we should leave these two alone.</utterance>
   <speaker>STEVEN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So after this I'll only need one remote for everything?</utterance>
   <speaker>CABLE GUY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>With amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting, sound controls, closed captioned, etc. Then he clicks through the channels. A music video, documentary on Hitler, Oprah Winfrey Show, starving kids, Barney, court TV. The Cable Guy watches emotionless.</context>
      <utterance>You know you're pretty good at this. You could be a cable guy yourself.  Now let me check your levels.</utterance>
   <speaker>CABLE GUY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Steven does.</context>
      <utterance>All right. That about does it. I just have some paperwork for you to fill out. Sign here.</utterance>
   <speaker>CABLE GUY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Steven laughs. The Cable Guy joins him, but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too long. As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment. The Cable Guy does not want to leave.</context>
      <utterance>That gave me power of attorney over you.  Joking.</utterance>
   <speaker>CABLE GUY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Cable Guy walks to the door.</context>
      <utterance>I'm about finished here.  Okay. I feel good about this.</utterance>

The Cable Guy's face appears in front of him, screaming like a mad man. He licks Steven's face quickly, then disappears back into the hole. Steven falls back. He hears the Cable Guy scuttle away. Steven sticks his head back down into the hole only to see the dust in the floorboards swirl in the aftermath of the Cable Guy's exit. He hears the Cable Guy crawling through the walls above him, then through the side walls, and away into the distance. When it clears he discovers a small makeshift observation room has been set up in the crawlspace. There are a few photos pasted to the floorboards. One shows the Cable Guy as a child standing next to his mother. Steven's picture has been pasted into those photos making him look like the Cable Guy's brother. The only other photo is of Jerry Springer. Steven sees a small television monitor and a set of headphones from which the Cable Guy has been watching him. He looks at a cellular phone. Every speed dial on the back of the phone says "Steven" next to it. Steven gets up, and runs out of his front door.</context>
