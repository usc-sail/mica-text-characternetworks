      <context>Robert nods. But neither of them moves. They stand motionless for a beat, then Annie begins to break down and eases herself into Robert's arms. Robert embraces her, kissing her head, with an almost fatherly comfort. His expression tells us it's the moment he's been expecting... and wanting. Now she'll be all right, in his arms. Whatever distance between them, whatever problems felt insurmountable last night on the phone, are now, for the moment -- for Robert -- gone. But Annie's expression tells us something different. Her instinct to hold him was honest... but the effect isn't the same anymore. Something doesn't feel right. Something isn't working anymore about his comforting embrace.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I'm sure that's what you think but that's not what I'm seeing. You may think you're asking for a lope, but your body may be saying something else altogether. You might be putting too many conditions on him. For instance, you might be saying "GO, but, hey, don't go too fast." He can tell that from the way you feel. Your body can't lie.

Making the animal go from a trot to a lope, letting it slow, then up to a lope again.</context>
      <utterance>It's a dance, see... Somebody has to lead and somebody has to follow.</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He throws the rope again and this time the transition to the lope is a smooth one.</context>
      <utterance>I want him to get so he can leave real soft. He's getting the idea now. He's not all braced up and tense like he was at the start. He's finding out it's okay.</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She nods, but he can see she's upset, feeling foolish. He walks the horse over to her, turns off the microphone and speaks sympathetically:</context>
      <utterance>You see that? He's getting better already. Pretty soon, if you work at it, you'll be able to make all these transitions easy on a loose rein.  Yeah, and pigs'll fly.  He's going to be okay -- so long as you don't go yanking on him.</utterance>

      <utterance>Look, the truth is it's all about self- preservation. These animals.  ... well, they just have such big hearts, you know? There's nothing they want more than to do what you want them to do. But when the messages get all confused, the only thing they know to do is try and save themselves...

      <context>Annie is choked with fury. She doesn't know whether to scream, cry or strangle Grace. She turns away and begins walking quickly, blindly, up past a grove of trees. She comes to a CEMETERY enclosed by a black railing. At the crest of the hill there's a stone monument "The Little Bighorn Cemetery." In the growing darkness, she sees, scattered on the hillsides below her, white tombstones. A place of sorrow. A cool breeze ruffles her coat and she sticks her hands in her pockets. Frustrated, alone, at a complete loss as to what to do, what action to take -- Annie, for the first time in frozen, standing still -- and with her, comes a rush of emotion. She sits with her back against the monument and begins to weep. For Grace, for Robert, herself, for the tombstones, for everyone. A FLASHLIGHT shines on her face. It is a PARK RANGER.</context>

He quietly makes his way along Pilgrim's side, along his flank, prompting Pilgrim to move out from the shadows, into the light. Tom moves to look at him. And Pilgrim suddenly kicks out at him. Tom, not cowed, stands his ground. He bends, looking at Pilgrim's withered legs. He looks up at his scarred head. He looks into the pools of the horse's tortured eyes. Pilgrim stands still -- allowing Tom this brief intimacy. As Grace walks towards the stable, she realizes that the door is open and Tom must be inside. She is amazed. Annie, appearing behind her, is also impressed. Tom exits the stable and sees them, as he closes the doors.</context>
      <utterance>Okay now... Okay now...</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He walks straight towards them -- veering more to Grace. He stops in front of her and they look into each other's eyes -- in a way that reminds us of how Tom looked at Pilgrim. Except, Grace is made even more uncomfortable by the intimacy. She turns away and walks to the corral, to lean on a post -- as if she doesn't care. Tom turns to Annie.</context>
      <utterance>Well... You're closest anyone's gotten.</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>

      <context>Grace reacts anew to Tom's remark. She likes her mother being dis-empowered. Annie keenly understands the importance of Tom putting it this way to Grace. Grace has all eyes on her -- just what she wants. All waiting for her response. She turns away, flicks her head and says:</context>

She hides her embarrassment by answering it, walking away. Tom gives her a look. Grace is loving this. Tom turns back to Pilgrim.

He rears, splashing Tom, not wanting to come out of the water. Grace is worried. She looks to Joe and sees he is concerned too, though he stands quietly. Annie hears the commotion from where she stands and finishes her call to return to the pond. Tom enters the pond, waist deep in water, trying to grab Pilgrim's rope. Pilgrim rises up, rearing at him. Joe and Smokey, sensing danger, come closer to the pond. Annie appears beside Grace and watches as Tom reaches for the rope again. Pilgrim rears again. Tom stumbles backwards from his hooves. Annie gasps. Grace turns to walk away from the pond. She can't watch -- it brings back too much. But as she does, she is stopped by the sight of -- Tom, righting himself, unphased, calmly walks back to Pilgrim.

She appears to his side and, without speaking, tries to indicates she has his coffee by leaning it toward him. Tom sees her and accepts it with a grateful nod. Annie waits. Nothing happens. Feeling foolish, she begins to walk back. At some point, she turns to see Pilgrim moving across the pasture toward Tom. He stops in front of him, just a few feet away. Tom says something to him. Annie is intrigued -- and she knows enough to stay quiet now. She watches Pilgrim walk over to him. She watches as Tom gets up and pats Pilgrim's scarred head. In spite of herself, Annie is somewhat moved by this act. Only we see Grace, peering out from the car, seeing this act of communion as well. Only we see her reaction to it. As Tom turns and walks back to the ranch, Pilgrim follows him. As he passes Annie, all he says is...</context>

But old Pilgrim there has forgotten. I'm the rock and they're the hard place. He thinks he hasn't got a friend in the whole wild world...</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Grace stiffens. She doesn't want to, but she's afraid to say "No" to Tom. He just insists by tossing it to her...</context>
      <utterance>Hold this for a minute...</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She's forced to catch it. He turns and rides away, chasing down Pilgrim, trying to edge him toward the herd. For a moment, he has him breaking to the left with the horses. But as soon as he's clear of Tom, he separates himself and comes to stop on his own. Tom rides back to Grace, taking back the flag.</context>
      <utterance>Hold onto it, go on...</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As he says this, he flashes a small, reassuring smile and a little wink. Grace melts just a little. As he rides away. Annie appears, having come from the Creek House. She calls:</context>
      <utterance>We'll get there, Grace.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Grace frowns a little -- her mother's "perfect timing." Annie approaches the arena, watching Tom riding. As he passes her;</context>
      <utterance>Grace? The clinic just called... They had to change your physical therapy appointment. We have to leave now.</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Annie notices how he says her name.</context>
      <utterance>Hello, Annie...</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He flashes a smile in her direction and Annie's expression comically matches her daughter's reaction. She quickly covers it, however. Her eyes follow him as he glides around the arena. It's like watching a great ballet -- his control of the horses, his effortlessness, his grace, his strength... She smiles to herself in appreciation. Then catches herself:</context>
      <utterance>Mr. Booker...</utterance>

   <speaker>TOM</speaker>

      <context>They continue walking as Grace smiles, enjoying being singled out for his joke. Annie responds, almost flirtatiously.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, Grace -- maybe we can get your mom to put me and you branding on the cover of her magazine. Start a whole new fashion craze.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Tom tips his hat and rides away... Annie smiles and nods... Grace doesn't like their sudden familiarity. Or her mother's coy manner. As they enter the Suburban, Grace asks point blank;</context>

   <speaker>GRACE</speaker>

      <utterance>No. See, Frank and Tom were raised near the Clark's Fork River, right between the Pryor and Beartooth Mountains. Beautiful piece of land. But they had this uncle Ned -- useless man, never interested in ranching. And when the grandparents died, he left for the city and sent word through lawyers he wanted his claim to the land so he could sell it. Three years of legation broke their father. Frank took it all in stride, but Tom... Tom loved that land. I don't think he ever got over it -- His home being sold out from under him. Seeing his father like that. Once he and Frank got their folks set up in a new place, Tom left... went off. We didn't see him for years... Annie is intrigued by what she's learning about Tom.</utterance>

And holding the other end of the loop taut with his left hand, he draws one side of the cord over the other with the middle finger of his right hand. Then he rolls his hand over so it's under the loop, and back over it again, so that his finger is tip to tip with the Twin's.

      <utterance>About what?</utterance>
   <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.</utterance>

      <utterance>Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.</utterance>

   <speaker>TOM</speaker>

      <context>Grace nods. It is a pleasant memory. He motions for her to be quiet. An old ELK with a prodigious rack of antlers, has come down out of the mountains.

      <utterance>You see, Grace, I've got a problem. When I'm working with a horse, I like to know its history. Now, most times, the horse can tell you pretty much the whole story, but sometimes he can be so messed up in his head that you need more to go on. You need to know exactly what went wrong. Often times, it's the obvious thing, but something that went wrong just before that, maybe even some little thing...</utterance>

      <utterance>It's like if I'm driving and run into a tree. When somebody asks me, "Well, what happened?", I don't say, "Well, I plowed into a tree." I'd say, "The sun was in my eyes." or "I skidded." or "I took my mind off the road for a second." See what I mean?  I don't know how you feel about talking about it and I can understand you might not want to. But if I'm going to figure out what's going on in his head, it'd sure help if I knew exactly what happened that day.</utterance>

Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...</utterance>

And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared.

      <utterance>Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.</utterance>

      <utterance>He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.</utterance>

      <context>Tom puts his arms around her shoulders and walks out to Pilgrim. The horse pricks up his ears as they approach. Tom motions Grace to stop a short distance from Pilgrim so as not to crowd him. Tom walks over alone, reaching to gently take hold of him. Holding him by the bridle, he puts his head beside Pilgrim's, quietly speaking to him, soothing Pilgrim's neck with his other hand... Annie and Robert are fascinated. Anxious. Pilgrim never takes his eyes off Grace. Tom tries to ease him forward. Pilgrim resists, lifting his head and looking at Grace so you can see the white at the top of his eye. Tom turns him away, walking him in circles, trying to calm him. He leads him back to Grace. Pilgrim tosses his head and stomps his feet. Robert grows more anxious. Annie is calmer, more focused. Tom climbs up on him, riding him around the arena in an easy lope. Grace watches them go round the ring. She looks at her parents and tries to smile. They try as well. Tom dismounts and leads Pilgrim back to Grace. Pilgrim balks again, violently throwing his head, kicking... Grace's shoulders slump, she presses her hands in her pockets, fighting not to cry...</context>

      <context>Smokey re-enters the ring, carrying some rope. He talks briefly to Tom. Pilgrim, sensing something, turns and runs to the far side of the ring. Tom, his arms spread, walks over to him, keeping him by the fence. Tom takes him by the bridle. Smokey comes beside him. Tom unhitches the bridle and in its place slips a rope halter Smokey passes to him. Smokey then hands him two long ropes, one at a time. Tom fastens one under the halter and ties the other to the saddle horn. Tom asks Smokey.</context>
      <utterance>I want to watch.</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Smokey hands it to him. Tom quietly talks to Pilgrim, runs his hand down Pilgrim's left foreleg and lifts his hoof. Pilgrim slightly shifts. And when he's still, Tom slips the loop at the end of the soft rope over the hoof making sure it's snug. And taking the other end of the rope, he hoists the weight of Pilgrim's raised hoof and ties the rope to the saddle horn. Pilgrim stands on three legs -- an explosion waiting to happen. Tom moves away from Pilgrim, taking the halter line from Smokey. Pilgrim, trying to move, finds he's crippled. Scared, he lurches, hopping on his right foreleg. Seeing he can't walk, panicked, he tries to run. Tom and Smokey, brace themselves, lean back on their ropes and force him around them in a tight circle. He goes around and around like a crazed rocking horse with a broken leg. Tom looks over and sees Annie has left Robert outside the ring to stand by an anguished Grace -- her hands on her shoulders, gripping her. Robert watches, feeling too much a foreigner...</context>

   <speaker>FRANK</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But even Frank isn't so sure. Pilgrim, covered in sweat, still circles. As he runs, his hobbled foot jabs at the air, trying to find peace. He runs and runs as Tom and Smokey lean on the ropes -- until he can't run any more and stops. Tom and Smokey let the lines go slack. Pilgrim, stands there, his wet sides heaving, panting like an asthmatic, making loud rasping sounds. Tom and Smokey speak. Smokey hands him his rope. Turning, he gets a coiled lasso out of the sand. He swings the rope in a wide loop and makes it fall over Pilgrim's saddle horn. He pulls it tight. And he takes the other end of the rope to the far side of the fence and ties it in a quick release knot to the bottom rung. Coming back he takes the other two lines from Tom. Tom crosses to the rail. He starts putting pressure on the rope. Pilgrim feeing it, braces himself. The pressure tilts the saddle hold downward.</context>
      <utterance>It'll be OK, Grace.</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>

   <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Pilgrim snorts and foams at the mouth, fighting. But slowly, like a wounded bird, she starts giving in. He rolls over on his side and lays his head in the sand and is still. It seems like a total, humiliating surrender. Grace starts to sob, burying her face in Annie's chest. Robert feels impotent to help.</context>

      <context>Tom leads her across the ring, with his arm around her shoulder. Annie tries to maintain her composure. Robert remains still and focused. Tom and Grace come to Pilgrim, lying in the dirt, his breathing plaintive. Tom speaks gently;</context>

   <speaker>TOM</speaker>

   <speaker>TOM</speaker>

      <context>Grace knows there's no way out. She takes a breath and slowly kneels in the dirt beside him, with Tom's help. She lays on him, rubbing him, his hindquarters, his legs, his side, softly rubbing his neck and the wet silky side of his head.</context>

      <context>Robert, however, is hypnotized by the event. He is having a private epiphany of sorts. Grace sits in the dirt by Pilgrim and strokes him quietly -- she begins talking to him, the way Tom does. Tom watches, as he cautiously steps further away. Pilgrim looks up at Grace out of the dark pool of his one sad eye. They look at each other. And we understand there's a connection once more. A moment of understanding... and forgiveness. Grace starts to untie his ropes. Smokey is about to stop her but Tom shakes "NO"... Pilgrim, like an infant coming out of the water, breathing life for the first time, gets to his feet. Grace and him look to each other. And all is still. Grace grabs the saddle horn. Pilgrim shuffles as if he's going to bolt. Grace quietly reassures him... She then carefully puts her prosthetic leg in the stirrup. Pilgrim shifts slightly. Annie covers her mouth so as not to scream out her fear. Robert breaths heavily. They watch as Grace swings her leg, determined, and pulls herself into the saddle. Sitting on his back, Pilgrim tosses his head and looks as he's going to run off. But Grace puts her arms around his neck, and once again, quietly reassures him. She starts to ride him, slowly, her arms around his neck, talking all the while, around the ring. Annie laughs as she cries -- emotion overwhelming her. Robert feels almost numb with fascination, gratitude, confusion... The slow ride turns into a trot... then a lope... then a canter... round and round the ring. Frank and Diane smile. Diane looks to Tom and knows what he's feeling... Tom watches as any father would -- his heart pounding with pride for the miracle of his child. But he doesn't let on for a second. Grace brings Pilgrim to a stop, lifts her arms to the heavens, victorious. Everyone cheers. Smokey helps her off the horse. She stops to look at Tom, who busies himself with picking up the ropes... So she re-focuses on her parents. They run to each other and embrace... First, she and Annie... then, she and her father... But, as Robert and Grace hold each other and begins to exit, Annie manages to make eye contact with Tom... and tell him with one look, how grateful she is... and how much she loves him. And he receives it...</context>

      <utterance>And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other. Annie cannot remember a time when she ever loved her husband more than in this moment -- knowing what it took for him to say this. She would not disrespect it with denials. Her throat is choked with tears, she swallows down. She nods. Robert nods, feeling both pride and heartbreak in the same moment. He picks up his bag, kisses her goodbye and exits.</utterance>

      <utterance>I don't know any other way, Annie.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly;</context>
      <utterance>Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Annie is struck by the powerful sincerity of his words;</context>
      <utterance>You think this is easy for me!?</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Annie looks into his eyes and asks, softly defiant;</context>
      <utterance>It's just happened this way sometimes. I can't explain it. But I look at you and see Grace and I see Robert, and no matter what you decide about him, I just know this is right. Your life isn't here and you know it.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The point was to love each other.</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As if there has to be a result... Tom looks at her and says with an almost innocent conviction:</context>
      <utterance>Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The simplicity, and truth, of it hits Annie strongly. Annie releases herself from him and turns away... despondent. Realizing the utter truth and inevitability of what he says. She starts shaking her head. Tom can't hear it... He reaches for her;</context>
      <utterance>Because we had to... And I'll never stop loving you, Annie. Here. Where my life is.</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She turns back into his arms and they kiss passionately... holding each other... as if for the last time.</context>

      <context>She doesn't answer... as if she has found her own private place within her, at last... A place of strength. She looks as if she knows what must be done... She hears him about to walk away when she asks:</context>
      <utterance>Annie?</utterance>
   <speaker>ANNIE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Tom stops. Considers this. Then:</context>
      <utterance>Can we go for one more ride?</utterance>
   <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He exits. Not seeing the tears in Annie's eyes.</context>
      <utterance>Sure. I'll saddle them up.</utterance>

      <utterance>Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Annie is first surprised, then embarrassed but Robert seems so charming and his smile breaks into a laugh, that she just nods and laughs herself.</context>
