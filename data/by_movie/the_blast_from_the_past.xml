      <context>Eve and Cliff go to the bar. Adam sits down glumly. He looks across the room and catches the eye of Miss Sweet who is seated at a table with Heather. A GOOD LOOKING GUY is hitting on them. CUTTING BACK AND FORTH between Adam and them we see Miss Sweet's smile escalate. Then she nudges Heather who also looks over and smiles. Adam smiles back. Finish with a CLOSER SHOT OF HIS POV of Miss Sweet's hair, butt and legs.</context>

      <utterance>Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses.

      <utterance>In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on Los Angeles, my parents were in our fallout shelter. That's where I was born. We only survived because it was a huge shelter as fallout shelters go. My father worked on it secretly for years. When he had to, he used contractors, but always from out-of- state and always for just a portion of the job. He told them it was a secret government experiment done through CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he felt in this case he had no choice. Of course, it had to be a secret, because we had just enough supplies to last three people thirty-five years. That's also why I have no brothers or sisters. The air vent was the really tricky part, but he was able to cut into a flood control sewer. What I'd like to do Eve, is take you down into the fallout shelter with me. We could live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad said if I found a healthy girl I should "bring her on down". And you look plenty healthy to me.</utterance>
