      <utterance>A bullet, or a blade doesn't kill you, but makes a little hole in the lung, so every time you breathe, a little air leaks into the chest cavity, which starts to fill up like a balloon. And that balloon starts to push your organs to the side, crushing your lung, your liver, your heart. Your own breathing kills you, one breath at a time -- kinda like a job you can't stand or a bad lie you once told.</utterance>

Archie rips the wires from the table controls, goes to Troy, unhinges the wire from his jaw. The Interrogator writhes in pain on the ground. Archie takes the Interrogator's pistol, snaps open a knife, cuts the cord binding Troy to the chair and gives Troy the pistol. Troy sits, stained with oil, blood, tears. He gets up, looks down at the interrogator on the floor, points the pistol into the Interrogator's face. The Interrogator stares at Troy, who stares back. Archie watches, out of breath. Troy FIRES the gun just to the side of the Interrogator's face, into the ground. The Interrogator looks terrified, crying. Troy stares back, looks unhappy, lowers the gun.
