      <context>Curly responds slowly, rising to his feet, crying. Gittes reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of more expensive whiskeys. Gittes pours a large shot. He shoves the glass across his desk toward Curly.</context>
      <utterance>All right, enough is enough. You can't eat the Venetian blinds, Curly. I just had 'em installed on Wednesday.</utterance>
   <speaker>GITTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Curly stares dumbly at it. Then picks it up, and drains it. He sinks back into the chair opposite Gittes, begins to cry quietly.</context>

      <utterance>You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Gittes nods, walks on in.</context>
      <utterance>A Mrs. Mulwray is waiting for you, with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.</utterance>
   <speaker>WALSH</speaker>

      <context>Gittes walks over to her and again flashes a warm, sympathetic smile.</context>

      <utterance>Mr. Gittes...</utterance>
   <speaker>GITTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She holds her breath. The revelation isn't easy for her.</context>
      <utterance>Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MULWRAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Gittes looks mildly shocked. He turns for confirmation to his two partners.</context>
      <utterance>My husband, I believe, is seeing another woman.</utterance>
   <speaker>GITTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, really?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MULWRAY</speaker>

      <utterance>I'm afraid so.</utterance>
   <speaker>GITTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Gittes pulls up a chair sitting next to Mrs. Mulwray between Duffy and Walsh. Duffy cracks his gum. Gittes gives him an irritated glance. Duffy stops chewing.</context>
      <utterance>I am sorry.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MULWRAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?</utterance>
   <speaker>GITTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MULWRAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Of course not.</utterance>
   <speaker>GITTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mrs. Mulwray hesitates. She seems uncommonly nervous at the question.</context>
      <utterance>Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MULWRAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Gittes sighs.</context>
      <utterance>A wife can tell.</utterance>
   <speaker>GITTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MULWRAY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>...Yes of course.</utterance>
   <speaker>GITTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then go home and forget about it.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MULWRAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But...</utterance>
   <speaker>GITTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. MULWRAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Her intensity is genuine. Gittes looks to his two partners.</context>
      <utterance>But I have to know.</utterance>
   <speaker>GITTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>All right, what's your husband's first name?</utterance>

      <context>Mrs. Mulwray nods, almost shyly. Gittes is now casually but carefully checking out the detailing of Mrs. Mulwray's dress â€“ her handbag, shoes, etc.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.</utterance>

      <context>Gittes sighs.</context>
      <utterance>Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.</utterance>

      <utterance>In case you've forgotten, gentlemen, over five hundred lives were lost when the Van der Lip Dam gave way core samples have shown that beneath this bedrock is shale similar to the permeable shale in the Van der Lip disaster. It couldn't withstand that kind of pressure there.  Now you propose yet another dirt banked terminus dam with slopes of two and one half to one, one hundred twelve feet high and a twelve thousand acre water surface. Well, it won't hold. I won't build it. It's that simple. I am not making that kind of mistake twice. Thank you, gentlemen.</utterance>

      <utterance>So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Jake, listen.</utterance>
   <speaker>GITTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A stunning YOUNG WOMAN appears behind Gittes in his doorway. She's shortly joined by a small, GRAY-HAIRED MAN. They listen, unseen by Gittes.</context>
      <utterance>Shut up, Duffy, you're always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the Chinese do? So he says what do they do? His friend says the Chinese they screw for a while. Just listen a second, Duffy...</utterance>
   <speaker>GITTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>...and then they stop and they read a little Confucius and they screw some more and they stop and they smoke some opium and then they go back and screw some more and they stop again and they contemplate the moon or something and it makes it more exciting. So this other guy goes home to screw his wife and after a while he stops and gets up and goes into the other room only he reads Life Magazine and he goes back and he screws some more and suddenly says excuse me a second and he gets up and smokes a cigarette and he goes back and by this time his wife is getting sore as hell. So he screws some more and then he gets up to look at the moon and his wife says, 'What the hell do you think you're doing?  ...you're screwing like a Chinaman.' Gittes hangs onto Sophie's desk laughing his ass off. The little Gray-Haired Man winces. When Gittes looks up he sees the Young Woman, apparently in her late twenties. She's so stunning that Gittes nearly gasps.</utterance>

Involuntary manslaughter if anybody wants to take the trouble which they don't. It looks like half the city is trying to cover it all up, which is fine with me. But, Mrs. Mulwray.

      <utterance>Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton. Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought. That's news.</utterance>
   <speaker>YELBURTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally. But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.</utterance>
   <speaker>GITTES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?</utterance>

      <utterance>Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location...</utterance>

Palmer screams. Evelyn stands there astonished. Mulvihill's gun has clattered to the floor.</context>

You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.</utterance>
