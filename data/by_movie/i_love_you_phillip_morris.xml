      <utterance>Actually- I was in the yard once. Another guard asked him to pay him back five. He opened his wallet and I saw this picture of a little girl about Steffie's age. So I brought it up to him once, just to get him talking. That's the thing about having kids, you know? Gets people talking. Shared experience. Builds bridges. Something I learned. Anyway he tells me he's worried about her- mamma was gone. We talked awhile. You know, I just listened. That's all. I brought up the candles just one time but mostly just listened... And the next day, bedtime, there they were.</utterance>

      <utterance>The sheriff is desperate and goes to a psychic. All the woman says is rabbit. Rabbit-rabbit-rabbit, that's all. Well he thinks `bullshit' and he's driving back home and what happens? He sees a rabbit crossing the street in front of him. So he pulls over and follows it into the woods and he finds the missing car. All wrecked and turned over and the girl's inside... still alive. Eventually we find Steven and Phillip in the BACKYARD on a large DOUBLE CHAISE LOUNGE. Their sleeping min-pins are between them.</utterance>

      <utterance>I know you thought we were nothing but a lie- but underneath all those lies there was always something that was real. I thought about what you said to me. You said you don't know who I am. But I have to tell you- I know now. I know who I am. I mean- I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a CFO, I'm not a cop. Hell I'm not even an escape artist. Those Steven Russells are dead. And now, all that's left is the man that loves you. That's all. Nothing else. I'm just the man that loves you.  And if you can see that... believe it... then I promise I'll never be anything else ever again. A LONG, LONG SILENCE. Phillip looks to him.</utterance>
