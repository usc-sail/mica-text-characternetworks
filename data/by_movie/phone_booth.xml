      <context>CAMERA MOVES IN on the irate caller in the booth -- a very well-dressed gray-haired lady -- totally conservative in appearance.</context>
      <utterance>You're looking at the telephone booth at the corner of 45th Street and 8th Avenue in the heart of the Manhattan theatrical district. It has been scheduled to be removed and replaced by a kiosk. It's one of the few remaining phone booths left in the city.</utterance>
   <speaker>WOMAN IN BOOTH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You have lied to me for the last time, you lowlife prick bastard! I don't ever want to hear the sound of your fucking voice again.  Yes, well fuck you, too! She slams down the receiver and exits. The booth remains vacant for a brief interval.</utterance>
   <speaker>NARRATOR</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Someone is approaching the booth, fishing in his pocket for coins. This is STUART SHEPARD, snappily dressed, his hair styled and his nails manicured. Here is a man who clearly takes excellent care of himself. He sports a Donna Karen suit and silk Armani tie. He's about to step into the booth when he's accosted by a middle-aged man in a soiled apron who's run out of a nearby restaurant and has finally caught up with him.</context>
      <utterance>At least three hundred calls daily originate from this booth. The coins are collected twice a day. This booth has been burglarized forty-one times in the last six months.</utterance>

      <utterance>Stu, we got to talk.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Wish I could accommodate you, Mario, but this is my busy time of day.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How come you cross the street every time you go past the restaurant?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why don't I stop in later for some lunch?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>There's no more drinks or free meals until the restaurant starts showing up in the columns like you said.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm doing my level best for you people.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>One lousy mention in the Post and you expect to eat for six months!</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I got the food critic from the Village Voice all lined up to give you a review.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's what you tell me last July. And he never shows.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I was allowing you time to expand the menu. Wallpaper the bathrooms, for God sakes. You get only one shot with these fucking critics and I don't want you to blow a rare opportunity.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You the one blowing it. How long you think you can fuck everybody?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hold on right there. I've got a very excellent reputation around this town.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So how come you take two nice suits of clothes from Harry and never get his daughter on David Letterman?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hell, I'm not an agent. I'm a publicist.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mister, you're nothing!</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Believe me, Valerie's on the waiting list to audition. Harry's got no complaints. He just let me pick out this tie the other day.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That Harry's a damn fool!</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Mario, please let me make this up to you. How about I arrange for the opening night party for this new off-Broadway show I'm handling -- to be held at your place with local TV coverage on nine and eleven? I mean I had it promised to another client -- who actually pays me money. But it isn't firmed up yet. And I could throw it your way. Maybe.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What is involved?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You'd toss in the buffet for say seventy or eighty. The producers would supply their own vino, of course. I'd deliver you a truckload of celebrities. And if they like the food, they'll all come back, naturally.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What celebrities?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You want Liza Minelli? An Oscar winner. Or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is he still alive?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I saw him last night going into the Four Seasons. I'll bring you over a whole VIP list when we come by for dinner.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How come everybody wants to eat but nobody wants to pay?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You can't think small like that. Hey, you still feature musicians Fridays and Saturdays?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>At least they work for their meals.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What about Harry's daughter as an extra added attraction? She'll belt out five or six showtunes -- two sets a night -- and it won't cost you a fucking nickel.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How come?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Star Showcase! Let me handle setting that up. And when she eventually goes on Letterman, she'll announce I'm currently appearing over at Mario's fine supper club. Right over CBS she'll say that, Mario.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're full of shit. You know that? All bullshit!</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's just a vulgar word for PR.  Mario, you can't hurt my feelings. Even when I was a kid and they hurled certain invectives my way, it never bothered me. Other kids would fall apart if anybody called them a fucking name. Me, I just loved the attention! 'Shit-for- brains' -- that's what the bigger kids named me. And I answered to it. Hey, 'shit-for brains' reporting for duty. Everybody loved me for that. I could take abuse. After a while, I kind of wore them down. There was nothing more they could say to me. So they stopped. I kind of missed it.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry I even talked to you.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The frustrated restaurateur glares at him through the glass before giving up and walking off -- talking to himself as he goes up the block. INSIDE THE BOOTH, Stu inserts his thirty-five cents and dials.</context>
      <utterance>I'll bet your loving wife put you up to this. She saw me pass by and she sent you out in the street. But I don't hold it against you personally -- you still serve up superior veal chop.  Now I got urgent business to conduct, Mario. He slides the booth closed in Mario's face.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hello, Mavis, sweet creature.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Where have you been? Do you think I have nothing to do but wait around for you to call?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm only a few minutes late, loveliest individual on earth.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Stu, I'm so lonely. When can I see you?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Good news in that arena. Kelly goes into rehearsal as of Monday. You know how dedicated she is. By the time she gets back from dancing her ass off, she goes right to sleep. We'll have both our days and certain nights. Not to mention when they take the show on the road.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How long is that for?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Four to five weeks -- minimum.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Maybe I should quit my job so we can be together full time.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I wouldn't do that.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sometimes I think if I have to give one more fucking manicure...</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's how you met me.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I never saw a worse set of nails. Bit right down to the quick.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm much better groomed since you've been looking after me.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm glad you admit it.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Even Kelly remarked on it when I first met her.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She could care less how you look. She's only interested in pushing her own career. Some wife you're stuck with!</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The marriage is not without its compensations. Do you imagine I could afford that apartment on what I'm earning? Not with everybody cutting back on the publicity. Not to mention a million college graduates coming into the profession trying to cut me out. And one thing you can't expect from your clients is loyalty. They get a couple of bad notices, they dump you. Goodbye.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't go.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A conservative businessman now stands outside the booth waiting to use it. He deliberately glances at his watch a few times to demonstrate his impatience. This bothers Stu who slides the booth open a crack.</context>
      <utterance>I wasn't saying goodbye to you. I was saying how the clients try to give you the wave off without even a month's notice.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What? Is your watch busted? It's twenty after eleven and I'm gonna be occupied indefinitely with my transaction. So get out of my face! He closes the booth up again and turns his back to the gentleman who gives up and departs.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sorry, honey. There will be no further interruption.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why must you always be calling me from some booth?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>On account of that phone records are regularly subpoenaed in divorce proceedings. And I don't want some entry showing up on my cellular bill either. She gets the mail. She looks these items over. Sometimes she even dials up a strange number to see who it is.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Then she suspects something.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's only because her last husband, the choreographer, ran around on her. She can't get that out of her head. That's how she caught onto him. The phone bills.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She hasn't developed much skill at holding a man.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You know what a self-fulfilling prophecy is? She was so sure I was going to find me a woman that she finally drove me back to you. I thought I'd feel all guilty about it -- but I guess it hasn't kicked in yet.  Still, I wouldn't do anything to hurt her. Basically, Kelly's a decent individual.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What about hurting me? Like last time?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hurt? You were glad to be rid of me.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>For a while I was, 'til I took stock of what was around. You're the lesser of many evils.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's about the nicest thing you ever said.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll have it engraved.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We've been up front with each other from the beginning. Let's keep it that way. How about a drink? Say seven o'clock? The Monkey Bar?</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Meet me in front. I don't like walking in there unescorted.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, you're great enough looking to be mistaken for one of those thousand dollar a night girls.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It happens all the time lately.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And wear that short black number I bought you from Bendel's.</utterance>
   <speaker>MAVIS' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Again? I don't know if it's me or that dress you like.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He hangs up. Then whips a tiny cellular phone out of his jacket pocket, flips it open and dials. Someone answers on the first ring.</context>
      <utterance>Have a good day. Make plenty of tips. And leave the whole evening open. She thinks I've got Knicks tickets.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Check it out. Tony award-winning producer Willie Beagle tossed his wife back into rehab again following her third attempt at diving off the terrace at their plush eighteen room residence at the San Remo. I got it from the doorman.</utterance>
   <speaker>COLUMNIST</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I got it from their maid yesterday. It's in the paper today. Or don't you bother to read my shit?</utterance>

   <speaker>COLUMNIST</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>He hangs up. Stu looks pleased as he folds the cell phone and tucks it away. Then he starts to vacate the booth. The phone rings. And rings. Curious, he picks up the receiver. There's a voice on the other end of the line. A DISTINCTIVE MALE VOICE.</context>
      <utterance>I'll drop your item in sometime next week. If you promise not to call me for a month.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Indeed that street corner is surrounded by high rise buildings and hotels.</context>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's busted. Every damn phone on Eighth Avenue is busted but this one.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I'm not through! Go in a restaurant or someplace, but get away from me!</utterance>
   <speaker>FELICIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She tries to pull open the sliding door to the booth but Stu jams it shut, right on her hand.</context>
      <utterance>I'm gonna pull you out of that booth and snatch you ballheaded!</utterance>
   <speaker>FELICIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You assaulted my person.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Let me hear from your lawyer!</utterance>
   <speaker>FELICIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She stalks off obviously in search of assistance.</context>
      <utterance>You're hear alright. I'm coming back. And your ass better not be around.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Good work, Stu. Now let me see you dial. Tuck the receiver under your chin and dial your remote.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He punches in the digits. The phone rings -- and rings.</context>
      <utterance>I'm doing it.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I told you she was out.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>

      <utterance>What's taking you so long? I thought we were having some lunch at Mario's?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Change of plan. We're not eating in that dump any more.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How come?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The Health Department gave them a 'C' rating -- that's how come. Here I'm trying to put the place on the map and he fucks it all up with a major roach problem.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's disgusting. Okay, I'll fix us a sandwich. Where are you now?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Just in a phone booth.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How come? The caller ID says you're on your cellular.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh yeah, I am.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But you're also in some phone booth?</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Explain that one, Stu.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I only stepped in because the traffic was so loud outside.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well just hurry on back.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tell her you can't.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>

      <utterance>Not for a few minutes.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY'S VOICE</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Are you sure you're alone? I hear somebody in the background.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The guy in the next booth. He's got a bad connection and he's hollering his fool head off.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You've got an answer for everything.</utterance>

      <utterance>What man?</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Some person who phoned fifteen minutes ago -- just after you went out.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't understand...</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This total stranger rang up and told me to wait by the phone -- because you'd be calling me in a few minutes -- from a booth. And I said what would he be doing in any phone booth?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And what did this guy say?</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He said you'd be making phone calls. What else?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Making calls is part of my business.</utterance>

      <utterance>To whom?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>

      <utterance>Clients. People. Planting items like I do.</utterance>

      <utterance>Women?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Once in a while one of them could be a woman. I just called "Elaine's" and talked to her to see who was in there last night.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You know exactly what I mean.</utterance>

      <utterance>You're not going to start that shit again?</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I just feel something is wrong.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What could be wrong?</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The way you sound. You don't sound like yourself.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah? Who do I sound like?</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Someone who's scared. There's fear in your voice like I've never heard before.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>See, Stu? Kelly agrees with me.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I want you to come back home. Now!</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I told you. In a while.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No. I want you here now. In case he calls back, I don't want to answer again.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why should he call back?</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY'S VOICE</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I feel like he's going to.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're not telling me all he said. What are you holding back?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>CLICK! She hangs up.</context>
      <utterance>I can't discuss it on the phone. Just get over here!</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why did you do that to her? She never did you any harm.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How would you know? Everybody does harm to somebody. And then they try their best to forget it.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Maybe me -- but not her. Whatever I've done, there's no reason to take it out on her.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Suppose that's the only way I can get to you? You claim you love her.</utterance>

      <utterance>Yeah, I do.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>

   <speaker>STU</speaker>

   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Still you have to uphold your status as an honorary asshole.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Listen, I've treated all my women decent. I never laid a hand on any of them, even when provoked. And I always let them down easy.  I'm not ready to let Kelly go. Maybe I never will be.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What if she dumps you first? What's the odds she's already taken up with somebody? One day soon you'll come home and find her gone along with the CD player and the</utterance>

   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I never indicated I had binoculars. I said I had a highly magnified telescopic image of you that brought you up so close I could see where you nicked yourself under the chin shaving this morning.</utterance>

      <utterance>I may very well do that, Stu. In the meantime, think about what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted on it.</utterance>

      <utterance>A high-powered .30 calibre bolt action Remington 700 with a carbon one modification and a state of the art Henzholdt tactical sniperscope. And you're in the cross hairs, Stu.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>There's only one way I can prove it to you. Hang up the receiver and find out. At this range, the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine.</utterance>

   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>For plenty of reasons! Because you hung up. For years I hated people hanging up on me. Ex-girlfriends. Women I didn't even know. Prospective employers.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I get hung up on all the time. You get used to it.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Or else you don't. I worked for months getting people to switch to MCI -- being insulted at and being hung up on hundreds of times a day. The ones that cursed me out for invading their privacy never bothered me as much as those that clicked off without even bothering to reply.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>

      <utterance>Can you feel it on you now? The heat of it. I'm moving the strike zone down to your stomach area. Now I'm raising it up again. Directly above the chest cavity -- sliding up to the forehead just above the left ear.</utterance>

   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh yes you are. Can I crawl out using the booth as a shield? Can I crawl to that Chrysler illegally parked only three or four feet away? The shattering glass may cut me, but it'll only be superficial. Otherwise, this lunatic will never let me out alive.</utterance>

Killing two weeks ago in the theatre district? Turn out a sniper did the job. Yeah, a sniper with a rifle. Now he's got another victim lined up. Not just your anonymous New Yorker, but Liza. Now you can't call anybody or Ms. Minelli's dead meat and so am I. She's hostage in a phone booth right in the sniper's sights. But he says he'll talk to you and let her walk.

   <speaker>FELICIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Leon reaches into the booth and grabs Stu's jacket.</context>
      <utterance>Whip his arrogant ass.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>It looks like a stalemate. Stu isn't vacating the booth and Leon and his lady are reluctant to touch him further. He does indeed look sick.</context>
      <utterance>Touch me and I'll throw up on you. At the suggestion, Leon lets go quickly.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>

      <utterance>What do you have in mind?</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly the red dot reappears on the forehead of the pimp. Leon doesn't realize it's there. The hooker behind him has no way of seeing it. But to Stu, there's no way to miss it. He reacts.</context>
      <utterance>I'll think of something.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>God -- no.  Don't. It's not necessary.</utterance>

      <utterance>You're not doing too well. I can settle it in a fraction of a second. Shall I demonstrate?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No.  For your own safety, mister, just walk away.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now the man is turning aggressive... issuing threats upon my person.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're making this happen.</utterance>
   <speaker>LEON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Reluctant to touch Stu again, Leon assaults the booth itself. He begins shaking it violently -- trying to rip it from its foundation. And the rickety booth is not too sturdy. It starts rocking back and forth. Stu is thrown around inside it, barely keeping his footing.</context>
      <utterance>If you don't hang up and step out, I'm about to topple this booth into the gutter with you inside it.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>But Leon continues rocking the booth. It won't come loose -- so in frustration, he punches in a side pane of glass. The glass shatters all around Stu, who does his best to shield himself from the slivers.</context>
      <utterance>This isn't my fault.  Stop that!</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>I can't.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Leon is smashing other panes of glass now -- one after another -- as Stu cowers inside.</context>
      <utterance>If he forces you out of that booth, I've told you what to expect. You or him, Stu.</utterance>
   <speaker>FELICIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A crowd of derelicts and street people are now gathering to watch the out of control pimp take out his wrath on the booth and its occupant.</context>

   <speaker>DERELICT</speaker>

      <utterance>I can still make him stop. Say the word. Can you hear me?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stu sees the red dot reappear on Leon's chest as he continues to barrage the booth with punches and kicks. Then Leon recoils, staggers a step backward. He doesn't realize he's been shot. There's been no sound of gunfire. Perhaps a silencer was used -- or the downtown traffic drowned out the solitary discharge. Leon looks confused at first. His ladyfriend has no idea he's wounded -- neither do the derelicts and street people who've assembled on the corner. Even Stu isn't sure -- until the blood starts oozing from the wound on the pimp's chest -- staining his yellow vest. He isn't assaulting the booth anymore. He's trying to keep his balance. He slumps forward, hanging onto the booth for support -- only a few inches from Stu's face. The blood runs down the side of the booth.</context>
      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>STU</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I said 'Yes, I can hear you.' Not 'Yes -- kill the motherfucker!'</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't try to renege on it. I was following orders.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Meanwhile, Leon leans upright against the booth. Then his legs cave in and he begins to slide to his knees. Felicia runs up beside him. She sees the blood.</context>
      <utterance>You're twisting it all around. I didn't do this!</utterance>
   <speaker>FELICIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She screams as Leon topples backwards onto the pavement. Now his chest wound is evident.</context>
      <utterance>I warned you not to cut yourself.  Look at all that blood. He must've hit an artery.</utterance>
   <speaker>FELICIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The crowd tightens around the fallen body. Street people who are fascinated but not shocked.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, Jesus. What is that? Talk to me! What happened?</utterance>
   <speaker>DERELICT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>I can use this.  Emergency. Yes. There's been a shooting at Forty-fifth and Eighth -- on the corner. A man is down. What's the difference who I am? I don't want to be involved.</utterance>
   <speaker>FELICIA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stu quickly disconnects the cellular.</context>

   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You keep insisting I'm a stranger. Probably because you don't recognize the voice. But there are cheap electronic devices available that disguise the voice. I might not even be a man. I might be one of those many women you've almost totally forgotten. One who doesn't forgive easily. One who wants to watch you squirm.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You sound so sure of that. But you've never provoked any man as much as have the women in your life. And so many of them, Stu.  Do you even remember their names?</utterance>

      <context>Police cars are pulling up on all sides of Eighth Avenue. Traffic has suddenly been shut down. Prowl cars have now blocked the streets. PRODUCTION NOTE: Everything is seen from Stu's perspective without intercuts. Half a dozen cops now emerge and approach with drawn guns.</context>

      <utterance>Now we're back to that again. It's always "Get out of the booth.' 'You can't stay in the booth.' Well, I like it in the fucking booth. It's my whole world now. It's my booth and I'm never coming out.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's what makes the job interesting. Finding out why. Something drove you to do this. You didn't go out today expecting this to happen. It was a nice day. You were out for a walk. And then suddenly it all changed.</utterance>

      <utterance>Something that pushed you over the edge?</utterance>

   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now that's a good idea. The Captain withdraws back across the street.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stu peers up ward as not one but two choppers appear above the tall buildings.</context>
      <utterance>He's lucky. I had him centered in my cross hairs. I really had to restrain myself. We hear the approach of a helicopter.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The helicopters circle above.</context>
      <utterance>It's not the police. It's the media. You're news, Stuart.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You've never gotten this much press for any of your clients. I'm making you a famous person.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They're just hoping for coverage of me dying in the gutter.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Their presence is putting the police on their continued best behavior.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Those cops are just looking for any excuse.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Then, as if on cue, Stu's cellular phone in his pocket starts ringing. But he can't allows himself to reach for it. To do so might cause the police to believe he was trying to draw his gun. It rings quietly -- virtually inaudible outside the booth. Drowned out by the traffic horns, the static from the police radios and the newly introduced sound of television helicopters circling over Eighth Avenue taking video coverage of the event below.</context>
      <utterance>Then don't give them one.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Who could it be?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stu is afraid to reach in his pocket lest the cops think he's going for a gun.</context>
      <utterance>Kelly. She was worried about me.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Maybe she's seen this on television. It must be on every channel by now. Breaking news.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She doesn't watch daytime TV.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The cell phone keeps ringing, almost drowned out by the sound of helicopters circling overhead.</context>
      <utterance>One of the neighbors could've alerted her.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why are you saying this? You want me to reach in my pocket so you can see them open fire?</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's an unwarranted accusation and very unbecoming in light of the good advice I've given in the past. Have I ever steered you wrong?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>God -- how I'd love to hear her voice.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The cellular won't stop ringing.</context>
      <utterance>It might even be worth it. She's insistent, isn't she?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If she knows I'm in trouble, she won't give up.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The cell phone continues beeping until the sound of it is maddening. Stu is still afraid to reach for it and provide the cops with an excuse to open fire.</context>
      <utterance>Probably glued to the TV by now. I'm watching coverage on two stations now. Channel surfing.  Well, there you are on two and four and five. Not any decent angles on you, though, stuck inside there.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But if you'd take one or two steps outside and look up, I think they could get a clear picture of you.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Finally the cell phone stops ringing.</context>
      <utterance>You said I'm not allowed to leave the booth.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I might be willing to bend the rules and let you enjoy your moment of fame. Set the phone down without hanging up... and take a step or two outside. Just for a minute. Then come straight back in or I'll be forced to provide 'live' coverage that should rival the historic Zapruder footage.  Nothing like an exploding head to excite viewer interest.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, thanks. I'll stay where I am.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It was only a suggestion. Since you're convinced I'm going to plug you anyway, it can't matter much.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>If you shoot me, you give yourself away.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Even without a muffler, they'd never hear the report with all this noise. Afterwards, it'd take them a good ten minutes to realize you weren't plugged by some overzealous officer. Then they'll blame the media for inciting a crackpot vigilante to come down here and do the SWAT team's job for them.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You expected them to come. You had this all worked out.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The damned cell phone starts beeping again. Stu fights the temptation to grab for it and hear Kelly's voice for one last time.</context>
      <utterance>I write the scenario and you all play your parts -- as directed.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Poor Kelly. What she must be going through.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why don't you tell her how you feel about her?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'd never get the words out. Not with fifteen or twenty rounds in me.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You can't be certain they'd fire. They'd see it was only a phone.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The cellular ringing continues jangling Stu's nerves.</context>
      <utterance>They wouldn't wait to see.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Then Stu notices something in the crowd gathering far across the street behind the police barricades. Countless faces rubbernecking, probably hoping to see some display of violence that would end with him face down dead on the pavement. And in the midst of them -- one face familiar to him. A female, quite pretty... even in tears. It's Kelly. (We see her only in LONG SHOT -- a distant figure in bright green jacket that makes her stand out from the crowd.)</context>
      <utterance>Why doesn't she hang up?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's her! She's not calling me. She's over there.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is she?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stu resists pleading because he knows his silence is more powerful. There's no glass in the left side of the booth since the late Leon smashed it all out. Nothing to shatter when the sniper squeezes off his shot.</context>
      <utterance>Stuart, my friend. Do you want to see how close I can come without actually hitting you?</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The frayed yellow phonebook dangling from a chain under the telephone shudders under the impact of a direct hit. There's been no sound of a gunshot, but the damage is there to behold. Stu reaches for the phonebook. There's a bullet hole straight through it. Pieces of the .30 calibre slug have shattered into many tiny fragments and are imbedded between the pages, half-way through the thick volume. Stu pries pieces out of the pages of the directory. He looks at them in the palm of his hand.</context>
      <utterance>May I call attention to the yellow pages?</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stu wants to shout "STOP," but restrains himself. Not talking gives him some degree of power.</context>
      <utterance>Hollow points are designed to break up on impact. It would've behaved differently if it had pierced your soft flesh. The pieces would've bounced around looking for a way out. That's where the real damage occurs -- finding an exit -- deflecting off all that bone...</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stu still declines to answer. His silence seems his only weapon. He tosses the bullet fragments out of the booth onto the pavement.</context>
      <utterance>Still the silent treatment? My father used to dish that out when he chose to punish me. Not a word spoken -- one time for over a month. I'd try and goad him to acknowledge I existed, but he stared right through me. You're bringing back unhappy childhood, Stu. That's not wise.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stu realizes the sniper now has Kelly in his sights.</context>
      <utterance>Since you're ignoring me, I'll focus on someone else.  There she is -- nice and sharp. I can see the two little punctures in each earlobe and my God, what kind of a girl would have her nostril pierced?</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't necessarily have to kill her. I could be persuaded to settle for a reasonable mutilation. Which part of her displeases you most? If she turns a bit more in profile, I'm accurate enough to remove the tip of her unpleasantly protruding nose. It's just cartilage. Any decent cosmetic surgeon will have her looking better than ever.</utterance>

And when the forces of the law closed in, he was defiant... to the end.</utterance>

      <utterance>Exactly! We all understand the poor schmuck that gets laid off and comes back and shoots all his bosses. We all thought of doing that. But only he had the balls. The terminally ill husband who gets his policy canceled and machine guns the insurance company offices. Maybe somebody will finally get the message. You can fuck human beings over only for so long before they come back at you. I'm still holding on Kelly and she looks very concerned. I could relieve all that anguish in a fraction of a second.

      <utterance>You'll have one hell of a nasty welt. Busted rib. Maybe a permanent scar there.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It couldn't hurt much more if you really shot me.</utterance>
   <speaker>RAMEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Somebody was going to and we thought it may as well be us.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Did you get him?</utterance>
   <speaker>RAMEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sure as hell did. Thanks to you.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Still alive?</utterance>
   <speaker>RAMEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Barely.</utterance>
   <speaker>MEDIC</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Kelly is now brought over by a female cop. She drops to her knees beside Stu and tries to embrace him. The medics restrain her.</context>
      <utterance>We'll be giving him a hypo for the pain. It'll put him out for a while.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's okay. I'm not really shot.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I was so afraid. I thought...</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I thought so, too. But we're going to be alright. Both of us.</utterance>
   <speaker>KELLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Remember how you swore up and down you'd get me on TV? Well, you did. I already got interviewed on Fox and Channel Eleven and they even want me on A.M. America tomorrow morning.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Bet you didn't think I could deliver on that.</utterance>
   <speaker>MEDIC</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A gurney is wheeled over from a police ambulance. The medic is about to administer the hypo but Stu pushes him away.</context>
      <utterance>Will you please let go of him, Miss?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The medics are now ready to lift Stu onto the gurney and cart him off. But Stu struggles against them.</context>
      <utterance>No. No hypo. I want to see him first.</utterance>
   <speaker>RAMEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Relax. The guy's dying.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's why I've gotta talk to him. Please!</utterance>
   <speaker>RAMEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>We'll see.</utterance>
   <speaker>RAMEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There's nothing but static, mixed up feedback and multiple garbled voices on the other end of the line.</context>
      <utterance>This is Ramey. Over. This is Ramey. Ten-Four.</utterance>
   <speaker>RAMEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He crosses back to the phone booth -- picks up the dangling receiver.</context>
      <utterance>Shit. Get everybody off this wavelength.</utterance>
   <speaker>RAMEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hello. Hello! Pick up! Yeah, it's Ramey again. Can you hold the phone close enough so the perp can listen?</utterance>
   <speaker>COP'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He's not saying a word, Captain.</utterance>
   <speaker>RAMEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ramey looks back to where the medics are still trying to lift Stu onto the gurney.</context>
      <utterance>He's not about to talk to us. Maybe to him.</utterance>
   <speaker>RAMEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Forget that. Stand him up.  Can you stand?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I can try.</utterance>
   <speaker>RAMEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The medics support Stu and inch him back to the booth. It's painful, but Stu ignores it. Ramey holds the phone up so Stu can both listen and speak.</context>
      <utterance>Help him over here.</utterance>
   <speaker>RAMEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Here. Speak up.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's me. Do you hear me? Answer me.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Had to have the last word, Stu.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I finally beat your ass. Admit it, you fuck.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But you'll never forget me. I gave you the most thrilling day of your life. Say thanks.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Now you're gonna die, you bastard.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I lost a lot of blood. Don't you want to donate some for me? Then we'd really be part of each other.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Hang on. I can't wait to see you at the hospital. So I can yank your fucking air tube out.</utterance>
   <speaker>VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Wish I could give you that pleasure. You deserve it.  ... Only I'm out of time.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There's more violent coughing, then silence. Then a cop's voice is heard.</context>
      <utterance>What's your name? At least tell me who you are.</utterance>
   <speaker>COP'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stu stares at the receiver.</context>
      <utterance>He's gone.</utterance>
   <speaker>RAMEY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't worry. We'll find out who he is. And why he picked you.</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stu reaches over and hangs up the receiver. CLICK.</context>
      <utterance>No. You won't.  What do you want to bet you won't?</utterance>
   <speaker>STU</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Then he sinks into the arms of the medics who lower him onto the waiting gurney. The hypo is finally administered. It kicks in immediately, relieving the pain. He's wheeled away from the booth to the waiting ambulance. Kelly is already inside waiting to accompany Stu to the hospital.</context>
      <utterance>I'll spend my whole life trying to figure that out.</utterance>
