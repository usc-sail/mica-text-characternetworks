      <utterance>I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.</utterance>

      <utterance>There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear.

She turns back sobbing. He tries to get her up.</context>

Again her first number, "BLUE MOON," segues into "BLUE VELVET." This song she sings mainly to Frank. When it is over Frank continues watching Dorothy and everyone else applauds loudly.

I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.</utterance>

      <utterance>We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?</utterance>
   <speaker>JEFFREY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.</utterance>
