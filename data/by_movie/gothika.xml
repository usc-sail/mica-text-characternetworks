      <context>And now she turns. Young, seventeen tops. Busted lip, black eye. Miranda pulls off her coat, wraps it around the girl --</context>

   <speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The girl tries to speak but no words come out. Instead she produces a strained, wettish sound. Creepy as hell. And now she is prying Miranda's mouth open and she's much stronger than expected and Miranda is panicking --</context>

      <utterance>Miranda, this is very awkward. Technically I shouldn't even be treating you but the court has granted us a waiver until you're transferred. So whatever is said here won't leave this room. I won't tell Parsons, I won't tell anyone.</utterance>

      <utterance>You're losing grasp of the situation. It was different with those girls. I bet all they did was cry and scream.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF RYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>This throws her off. She shoots a quick glance at the door.</context>
      <utterance>Don't worry, you'll scream.  Take off your shirt.</utterance>

      <utterance>Aren't I a little old for you?</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF RYAN</speaker>

      <context>She hesitates. He draws his gun, tired. Removes the safety.</context>
      <utterance>Take it off.</utterance>
   <speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's for show. You know you can't shoot me.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF RYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But I can smash your teeth out and make it look like you bashed your head against the wall. Now shut up, take off your goddamn shirt and pull off your bra.</utterance>

   <speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Clearly not here. Sheriff Ryan's voice getting closer:</context>
      <utterance>Rachel, where are you when I need you?</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF RYAN</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>He appears at the doorway now, peeks inside the room. Sensing her in there. Miranda holds her breath.</context>
      <utterance>Those other girls -- make no mistake -- they knew what they were getting into.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF RYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He reaches the upturned desk and flips it over with a CLANGING SOUND. Miranda wasn't underneath that one. She scrambles to the door behind him as he turns --</context>
      <utterance>I'm not saying they knew they were going to die, but truth is, Doug and I didn't know it was going to end that way. It was just the natural extension of that moment. So yeah, we fucked them and we killed them. And we knew it was wrong. Sure we did.</utterance>

   <speaker>SHERIFF RYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Miranda stares, helpless. The Sheriff gestures for her to begin. Like he has all the time in the world. Miranda slides up the wall and starts to unclasp her bra under her shirt. Petrified --</context>
      <utterance>It wasn't some satanic pact, society didn't make us do it. But I believe given the proper circumstances a person is capable of anything -- certainly in my line of work you see it day in, day out.  Tell you what, keep the shirt. The bra will do.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF RYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>His demeanor and voice are eerily calm, as if in a trance. He takes the bra from her hand and hangs it around her neck, as if helping somebody with their tie. She takes a step back and finds herself pinned against the wall --</context>
      <utterance>Chin up, Doctor. You wanted to get to the bottom of this and you did. You followed it all the way through. This is how it ends.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF RYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He squeezes the bra tightly around her throat, choking her. She stares straight into his eyes -- her whole body simultaneously frozen in place and shaking uncontrollably --</context>
      <utterance>Doug settled down once you two got married. New start and all that. Wanted nothing to do with this runaway I'd found, Tracy Seaver --</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF RYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And now we PAN DOWN TO see Miranda's left hand ever so slowly reach for his holster...</context>
      <utterance>Or so he claimed. Because the truth, Doc -- is people never change. The son of a bitch couldn't resist. I asked him to dump the body and instead he went found some barn to work her out of his system some more. Go fucking figure.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>They're so close together their noses nearly touch. He gazes into her eyes, watching life drain out of her. He applies one final burst of pressure, stretching her skin to the point of no return --</context>
      <utterance>You can't count on anyone, even friends you've had your whole life.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF RYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>BLAM! A GUNSHOT rings out and half his ear explodes in a gush of blood. He stumbles back, still on his feet, dazed. He looks up at Miranda with the gun trained on him. Struggling to catch her breath. A faint smile forms on his lips, somehow appreciative of this turn of events.</context>
      <utterance>The only soul you can ever count on is yourself --</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF RYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He steps forward, almost playfully. She slowly shakes her head. Wraps her fingers tightly around the trigger --</context>
      <utterance>Why, Doctor. That was unexpected.</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF RYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He stares at her. Blood flowing from the side of his head. He's now standing directly in front of Miranda's open cell, weighing his options at triple speed --</context>
      <utterance>You sure about this?</utterance>
   <speaker>SHERIFF RYAN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He takes exactly half a step forward when Miranda drills a BULLET through his forehead. Sheriff Ryan splays backwards and lands with a crash.</context>
      <utterance>You need me alive for your story to stick. Be logical now. You know you can't kill me.</utterance>

      <context>Turlington is not used to being spoken to this way, certainly not by upstanding directors of psychiatric institutes. He leads the men down the corridor and unlocks the cell. The men wait as all three locks are dutifully undone and then the heavy door is slid open. The men look inside and instantly stop in their tracks.</context>
