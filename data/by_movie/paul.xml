      <utterance>Okay, that's great. I just wondered. I'm cool with it. Everyone's "˜bi' where I'm from. It's all about the pleasure thing, you know? We've evolved beyond paranoid notions of gender identity. I mean, procreation is only the functional aspect of sexual congress right? The human race is fairly advanced but most males still act like a cornered tiger if you imply the like "˜smoking the bone' and let's face it they probably do. Look at single sex, empirical institutions, boarding schools, prisons, pirate ships, places where the choice has been removed, everyone's banging everyone else and there isn't a whiff of socio-cultural angst. Get out into the real world and guys are getting smacked int he chops for wearing pink socks. You think you're so sophisticated because you can distinguish yourself from your own reflection but ultimately you're part of a deeply neurotic species and you'd all be a lot better off if you stopped worrying and learned to love the bum.</utterance>

It illuminates the scary corners, fills the gaps, makes the universe easier to comprehend. Thing is, it's okay not to know everything. I mean, who knows what's really out there?

They told me it was a meteor that squashed little Paul. Took me away and did tests they did, said it was for cosmic radiation. They said I was concussed, hallucinating, but I knew you were real. I pulled you from that spaceship myself. Sat with you till the men came and took you away. If Pop hadn't had to go to Casper, he would have seen you too. They kept telling me I'd imagined it but I knew different. Pop tried to understand but they filled his head with "˜delayed this' and "˜post- traumatic that'. He just used to smile and say "˜there, there Tara'. He got sick when I was seventeen and died a few years later. I inherited this place. Word got out about my story not long after it happened, so I didn't really have any friends. Kids used to throw stones at the house and call me names. I just kinda retreated into myself. I'd spend whole nights up on the roof, staring at the sky, hoping to catch a glimpse of you again. I always believed that one day you"˜d come back and here you are.</utterance>
