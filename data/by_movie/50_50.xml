      <utterance>My parents are in a lull, which is what happens after 35 years of marriage. You've only been dating her four months. At our age sex is all we have. Every time she refuses to sleep with you a small piece of every man's soul dies. She's killing us Adam...You're a semi- smart, semi-successful, semi- average looking dude. Just based on that you could get with at least one third of the female population.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well no one knows for sure. But it's suspected that because Neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman, he roamed the land, only fending for himself - never learning to cohabitate with others. So as Cro Magnon families settled into Europe, they took over the land. One by one, Neanderthal was pushed out...and never seen, or heard from again.</utterance>

      <context>Seth comes upon Adam who is working closely on a diorama.</context>
      <utterance>And if you look over on your left you'll see our newest exhibit "The Last Days Pompeii." Buried in 79 AD by the catastrophic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, Pompeii remained hidden and forgotten until 1748 when archeologists began to excavate the site. Here we see exquisitely preserved objects that offer a glimpse into the day-to-day life of this ancient city.</utterance>

      <utterance>This here is Adam, one of our curators. Adam do you want to tell us what you're working on?</utterance>
   <speaker>ADAM</speaker>
      <mode>UPBEAT</mode>
      <context>Adam's exhibit is a highly morbid depiction of Pompeii's final hours. The scene is total chaos. Ash flies through the air. Hot molten lava engulfs the town. Miniature men, women, and children run through the streets in horror. People are sacrificing whatever they can for the Gods. There's a wild orgy in the streets. And a giant TYRANNOSAURS REX model devours a villager.</context>
      <utterance>Gladly. This here is a depiction of what Pompeii's final 19 hours probably looked like.</utterance>
   <speaker>ADAM</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>The tourists take pictures. In shock, Seth quickly shuttles the group away.</context>
      <utterance>According to Pliny the Younger - "You could hear women lamenting, children crying, men shouting. There were some so afraid of death that they prayed for death. Many raised their hands to the gods, and even more believed that there were no gods any longer, and that this was one unending night for the world."</utterance>
