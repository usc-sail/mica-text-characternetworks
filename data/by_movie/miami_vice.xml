Another round goes through the passenger door, through the passenger, through the driver, out the driver door and into the night...</context>

      <utterance>They're not. They collect in Miami. Montoya, the producer, handles deliveries. That's his end, and he varies the routes. We got some FLIR off an AWAC of a coupla go-fast boats, on one run, that's all.</utterance>

      <utterance>In the '80's, air routes came into favor. It required many pilots. The best were American. Former crop-dusters. They didn't fly by the book. Tell one: "Put that 747 down on this fifteen-hundred-foot runway." Somehow, he'd do it. Great pilots. But Pablo had a rule. After they flew six loads...this good pilot who facilitates so much good business... he would come back to Medelln or Barranquilla to pick up the next load?  And no one would ever see him again. He'd disappear.  "You a good pilot? Make a lot of money for Pablo? Thank you very much." And then Pablo would kill his ass. After six loads.  And who was Pablo Escobar? A provincial who got busted-out by the white collars from Cali. When the gringos got him, he was nobody. We're three times better than Pablo Escobar.
