      <utterance>Inspector, I'm saddened by your loss and touched by loyalty. But let's focus on the matter at hand. He walked right past me. We made eye contact. I know he recognized me. It was my son. A mother knows these things. I will sign anything, I will swear before a judge. And thank you, I do have all my faculties and friends who can vouch for my character.</utterance>

      <context>He hands her some forms.</context>
      <utterance>Yes. Of course he's a man. He'd be thirty-two. And no, I did not speak with him. I ran.  Inspector, my son was very, very disturbed. He had serious emotional problems. I assure you he was.  Is. Is a dangerous person.</utterance>

      <context>The Woman bristles. Stands, takes the forms.</context>
      <utterance>Madame. The police department cannot resolve your problem. You need to get permits from the coroner and health and safety department. You pay for an exhumation. You have someone qualified examine the remains. If it is the wrong body, the Forensic Examiner will confirm there is a problem and call us. Then we open an investigation.  No, Quebec City police will investigate. He is buried there, no?</utterance>

      <utterance>We cleared the Mayor. He read the article on you in Newsweek and insisted we fly you up. The papers say two campers had a drunken fight and the loser lost his head.</utterance>

      <utterance>This was not a heat of the moment killing. And the victim was buried complete with head. The grave was five-foot ten. The victim's height. With square corners. Dug with a shovel the killer had the foresight to bring.</utterance>

      <utterance>No. A large canine did that. Probably an old or sick timber wolf that couldn't hunt. It dug up the body and chewed off the head. It felt safe in the trees, away from the riverbank, away from the other wolves.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>

      <context>Inspectors Laval and Reynaud enter. Both give Grace wary nods. Inspector Laval hands the Medical Examiner a paper bag marked HUMAN REMAINS.</context>

   <speaker>INSPECTOR LAVAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Medical Examiner opens the bag. Removes a wig. No, not a wig; someone's ponytail and leathered scalp. Tangled with the hair is a braid of green nylon cord tied to two pieces of broomstick. The Photographer SNAPS some shots. The Medical Examiner gingerly untangles the cord.</context>
      <utterance>This was a meter from the skull. At soil level.</utterance>
   <speaker>MEDICAL EXAMINER</speaker>

   <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No. Look at it, braided parachute cord, two pieces of broom stick. You approach the victim from behind, loop it around his head and hold on for all your might. The more the victim struggles, the quicker he passes out. And now you have convenient handles to drag around two hundred pounds of dead kayaker.</utterance>
   <speaker>INSPECTOR LAVAL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That is a theory.</utterance>
   <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Laval bristles, he crosses to check his cell messages. Gillet looks at Grace, at the cord. Turns to her quietly.</context>
      <utterance>That's exactly what it is. A theory. That evidence supports. When the suspect is in custody you can ask him yourself what happened and you won't need me. Inspector.</utterance>

      <utterance>Always is, sir. I can give you a rough profile; white male, thirty to thirty-four. Has some college but no degree. Neat in appearance. At least six feet tall. Very intelligent. Charming when necessary. He uses murder as a tool, probably in furtherance of a criminal endeavor. He's killed before and will again unless caught.</utterance>

Then everything stops. Last Visa charge was to Travelocity for a plane ticket to Mexico city.</utterance>
