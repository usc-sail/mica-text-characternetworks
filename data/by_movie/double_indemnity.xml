There is a little light beyond the glass doors. Neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator, across reception room to doors. He pushes them open. The night watchman stares after him morosely, works lever, elevator doors start to close.</context>

      <utterance>Office memorandum, Walter Neff to Barton Keyes, Claims Manager. Los Angeles, July 16th, 1938. Dear Keyes: I suppose you'll call this a confession when you hear it. I don't like the word confession. I just want to set you right about one thing you couldn't see, because it was smack up against your nose. You think you're such a hot potato as a claims manager, such a wolf on a phoney claim. Well, maybe you are, Keyes, but let's take a look at this Dietrichson claim, Accident and Double Indemnity. You were pretty good in there for a while, all right. You said it wasn't an accident. Check. You said it wasn't suicide. Check. You said it was murder. Check and double check. You thought you had it cold, all wrapped up in tissue paper, with pink ribbons around it. It was perfect, except that it wasn't, because you made a mistake, just one tiny little mistake. When it came to picking the killer, you picked the wrong guy, if you know what I mean. Want to know who killed Dietrichson? Hold tight to that cheap cigar of yours, Keyes. I killed Dietrichson. Me, Walter Neff, insurance agent, 35 years old, unmarried, no visible scars --  Until a little while ago, that is. Yes, I killed him. I killed him for money -- and a woman -- and I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman. Pretty, isn't it?</utterance>

      <utterance>It began last May. About the end of May, it was. I had to run out to Glendale to deliver a policy on some dairy trucks. On the way back I remembered this auto renewal on Los Feliz. So I decided to run over there. It was one of those Calif. Spanish houses everyone was nuts about 10 or 15 years ago. This one must have cost somebody about 30,000 bucks -- that is, if he ever finished paying for it.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>About the insurance. My husband never tells me anything.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He crosses to the davenport to get the policies from his briefcase. She turns away from the mirror and sits in a big chair with her legs drawn up sideways, the anklet now clearly visible.</context>
      <utterance>It's on your two cars, the La Salle and the Plymouth.</utterance>

      <utterance>We've been handling this insurance for three years for Mr. Dietrichson...  That's a honey of an anklet you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>

      <utterance>We'd hate to see the policies lapse. Of course, we give him thirty days. That's all we're allowed to give.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, he'd have to join the club and pay a membership fee to start with. The Automobile Club is fine. I never knock the other fellow's merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson, but I can do just as well for you. I have a very attractive policy here.

Because if you came up here to claim on that truck, I'd have to turn you over to the law, Gorlopis, and they'd put you in jail. No wife. No kids --</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No? Look, Gorlopis. Every month hundreds of claims come to this desk. Some of them are phonies, and I know which ones. How do I know, Gorlopis?  Because my little man tells me.</utterance>
   <speaker>GORLOPIS</speaker>

   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Every time one of those phonies comes along he ties knots in my stomach. And yours was one of them, Gorlopis. That's how I knew your claim was crooked. So what did I do? I sent a tow car out to your garage this afternoon and they jacked up that burned-out truck of yours. And what did they find, Gorlopis? They found what was left of a pile of shavings.</utterance>
   <speaker>GORLOPIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What shavings?</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look, Mr. Keyes, I'm just a poor guy. Maybe I made a mistake.</utterance>

      <context>Gorlopis hesitates, then signs laboriously.</context>

      <utterance>What kind of an outfit is this anyway? Are we an insurance company, or a bunch of dimwitted amateurs, writing a policy on a mugg like that?</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Wait a minute, Keyes. I don't rate this beef. I clipped a note to that Gorlopis application to have him thoroughly investigated before we accepted the risk.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I know you did, Walter. I'm not beefing at you. It's the company. The way they do things. The way they don't do things. The way they'll write anything just to get it down on the sales sheet. And I'm the guy that has to sit here up to my neck in phony claims so they won't throw more money out of the window than they take in at the door.</utterance>

      <utterance>I get darn sick of picking up after a gang of fast-talking salesmen dumb enough to sell life insurance to a guy that sleeps in the same bed with four rattlesnakes. I've had twenty- six years of that, Walter, and I --</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And you loved every minute of it, Keyes. You love it, only you worry about it too much, you and your little man. You're so darn conscientious you're driving yourself crazy. You wouldn't even say today is Tuesday without you looked at the calendar, and then you would check if it was this year's or last year's calendar, and then you would find out what company printed the calendar, then find out if their calendar checks with the World Almanac's calendar.</utterance>

      <utterance>That's enough from you, Walter. Get out of here before I throw my desk at you.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Enough to cover doctors' and hospital bills. Say a hundred and twenty-five a week cash benefit. And he'd rate around fifty thousand capital sum.</utterance>

   <speaker>PHYLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That would make it easier for you, too. You wouldn't even have to talk to him. I have a little allowance of my own. I could pay for it and he needn't know anything about it.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Wait a minute. Why shouldn't he know?</utterance>
   <speaker>PHYLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Because I know he doesn't want accident insurance. He's superstitious about it.</utterance>

      <utterance>If there was a way to get it like that, all the worry would be over. You see what I mean, Walter?</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sure. I've got good eyesight. You want him to have the policy without him knowing it. And that means without the insurance company knowing that he doesn't know. That's the set-up, isn't it?</utterance>
   <speaker>PHYLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is there anything wrong with it?</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>

      <utterance>I think it's lovely. And then, some dark wet night, if that crown block fell on him --</utterance>

      <utterance>What crown block?</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>

   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Of course, it doesn't have to be a crown block. It can be a car backing over him, or he can fall out of an upstairs window. Any little thing like that, as long as it's a morgue job.</utterance>

      <utterance>A desk job. Is that all you can see in it? Just a hard chair to park your pants on from nine to five. Just a pile of papers to shuffle around, and five sharp pencils and a scratch pad to make figures on, with maybe a little doodling on the side. That's not the way I see it, Walter. To me a claims man is a surgeon, and that desk is an operating table, and those pencils are scalpels and bone chisels. And those papers are not just forms and statistics and claims for compensation. They're alive, they're packed with drama, with twisted hopes and crooked dreams. A claims man, Walter, is a doctor and a blood-hound and a cop and a judge and a jury and a father confessor, all in one.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>And the stuff that came out. She'd been dyeing her hair ever since she was sixteen. And there was a manic- depressive in her family, on her mother's side. And she already had one husband, a professional pool player in Baltimore. And as for her brother --</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <context>He goes out. Neff is alone. He watches the door close, then turns and goes slowly to the water cooler. He fills a paper cup and stands holding it. His thoughts are somewhere else. After a moment he absently throws the cupful of water into the receptacle under the cooler. He goes back to the desk. He takes his rate book out of his brief case and puts it on the desk. He buttons the top button of his shirt, and pulls his tie right. He leaves the office, with his briefcase under his arm.</context>
      <utterance>Fair enough. Just get this: I picked you for the job, not because I think you're so darn smart, but because I thought maybe you were a shade less dumb than the rest of the outfit. I guess I was all wet. You're not smarter, Walter. You're just a little taller.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF'S VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That was it, Keyes, and there was no use kidding myself any more. Those fates I was talking about had only been stalling me off. Now they had thrown the switch. The gears had meshed. The machinery had started to move and nothing could stop it. The time for thinking had all run out. From here on it was a question of following the time table, move by move, just as we had it rehearsed. I wanted my time all accounted for for the rest of the afternoon and up to the last possible moment in the evening. So I arranged to call on a prospect in Pasadena about a public liability bond. When I left the office I put my rate book on the desk as if I had forgotten it. That was part of the alibi.</utterance>

      <utterance>I've met Mr. Neff. How do you do.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Phyllis nods silently.</context>
      <utterance>Mrs. Dietrichson, I assure you of our sympathy in your bereavement. I hesitated before asking you to come here so soon after your loss.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But now that you're here I hope you won't mind if I plunge straight into business. You know why we asked you to come, don't you?</utterance>

      <utterance>Your husband had an accident policy with this company. Evidently you don't know that, Mrs. Dietrichson.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Please, Mrs. Dietrichson, I don't want you to think you are being subjected to any questioning. But there are a few things we should like to know.</utterance>
   <speaker>PHYLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What sort of things?</utterance>
   <speaker>NORTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Neff is staring straight at Phyllis.</context>
      <utterance>We have the report of the coroner's inquest. Accidental death. We are not entirely satisfied. In fact we are not satisfied at all. Phyllis looks at him coolly. Keyes looks vaguely interested.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Phyllis doesn't bat an eyelash.</context>
      <utterance>Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson, we suspect suicide.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry. Would you like a glass of water?</utterance>
   <speaker>PHYLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Please.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He indicates a thermos on a stand near Neff. Neff pours a glass of water and carries it over to Phyllis. She has lifted her veil a little. She takes the glass from his hand.</context>
      <utterance>Mr. Neff.</utterance>
   <speaker>PHYLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Their eyes meet for a fraction of a second.</context>
      <utterance>Thank you.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Had your husband been moody or depressed lately, Mrs. Dietrichson? Did he seem to have financial worries, for instance?</utterance>
   <speaker>PHYLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He was perfectly all right and I don't know of any financial worries.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>There must have been something, Mrs. Dietrichson. Let us examine this so- called accident. First, your husband takes out this policy in absolute secrecy. Why? Because he doesn't want his family to suspect what he intends to do.</utterance>
   <speaker>PHYLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Do what?</utterance>
   <speaker>NORTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Norton flips his fingers impatiently at Keyes who doesn't even bother to look up.</context>
      <utterance>Commit suicide. Next, he goes on this trip entirely alone. He has to be alone. He hobbles all the way out to the observation platform, very unlikely with his leg in a cast, unless he has a very strong reason. Once there, he finds he is not alone. There is a man there. What was his name, Keyes?</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>His name was Jackson. Probably still is.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Jackson. So your husband gets rid of this Jackson with some flimsy excuse about cigars. And then he is alone. And then he does it. He jumps. Suicide. In which case the company is not liable.  You know that, of course. We could go to court --</utterance>
   <speaker>PHYLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She makes as if to rise indignantly.</context>
      <utterance>I don't know anything. In fact I don't know why I came here.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Phyllis rises coldly.</context>
      <utterance>Just a moment, please. I said we could go to court. I didn't say we want to. Not only is it against our practice, but it would involve a great deal of expense, a lot of lawyers, a lot of time, perhaps years.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So what I want to suggest is a compromise on both sides. A settlement for a certain sum, a part of the policy value --</utterance>
   <speaker>PHYLLIS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She turns and walks out. The door closes after her. There is a pregnant pause. Keyes straightens up in his chair.</context>
      <utterance>Don't bother, Mr. Norton. When I came in here I had no idea you owed me any money. You told me you did. Then you told me you didn't. Now you tell me you want to pay me a part of it, whatever it is. You want to bargain with me, at a time like this. I don't like your insinuations about my husband, Mr. Norton, and I don't like your methods. In fact I don't like you, Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Norton pours himself a glass of water and stands holding it.</context>
      <utterance>Nice going, Mr. Norton. You sure carried that ball.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Only you fumbled on the goal line. Then you heaved an illegal forward pass and got thrown for a forty-yard loss. Now you can't pick yourself up because you haven't got a leg to stand on.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Keyes stands up.</context>
      <utterance>I haven't eh? Let her claim. Let her sue. We can prove it was suicide.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Can we? Mr. Norton, the first thing that hit me was that suicide angle. Only I dropped it in the wastepaper basket just three seconds later. You ought to take a look at the statistics on suicide sometime. You might learn a little something about the insurance business.</utterance>
   <speaker>NORTON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

      <utterance>Yeah. In the front office. Come on, you never read an actuarial table in your life. I've got ten volumes on suicide alone. Suicide by race, by color, by occupation, by sex, by seasons of the year, by time of day. Suicide, how committed: by poisons, by fire-arms, by drowning, by leaps. Suicide by poison, subdivided by types of poison, such as corrosive, irritant, systemic, gaseous, narcotic, alkaloid, protein, and so forth. Suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps from high places, under wheels of trains, under wheels of trucks, under the feet of horses, from steamboats. But Mr. Norton, of all the cases on record there's not one single case of suicide by leap from the rear end of a moving train. And do you know how fast that train was going at the point where the body was found? Fifteen miles an hour. Now how could anybody jump off a slow moving train like that with any kind of expectation that he would kill himself? No soap, Mr. Norton. We're sunk, and we're going to pay through the nose, and you know it. May I have this? Keyes' throat is dry after the long speech. He grabs the</utterance>

      <context>Norton doesn't move or speak. Keyes puts his hat on and crosses towards the door, Neff after him. With the doorknob in his hand Keyes turns back to Norton with a glance down at his own shirt sleeves.</context>

He gathers up the morning paper which is lying untidily on the floor and puts it in the waste-paper basket. The door bell rings. Neff stops in sudden alarm. It can't be Phyllis. The time is too short. For a second he stands there motionless, then crosses to the door and opens it. In the open door stands Keyes.</context>
      <utterance>Okay. But be careful. Don't let anybody see you.</utterance>

      <utterance>Look. A man takes out an accident policy that is worth a hundred thousand dollars if he is killed on a train. Then, two weeks later, he is killed on a train. And not in a train accident, mind you, but falling off some silly observation car. Do you know what the mathematical probability of that is, Walter? One out of I don't know how many billions.

      <context>Neff stares at her tensely. He knows only too well who the nurse was.</context>
      <utterance>We were up at Lake Arrowhead. That was six years ago. We had a cabin there. It was winter and very cold and my mother was very sick with pneumonia. She had a nurse with her. There were just the three of us in the cabin. One night I got up and went into my mother's room. She was delirious with fever. All the bed covers were on the floor and the windows were wide open. The nurse wasn't in the room. I ran and covered my mother up as quickly as I could. Just then I heard a door open behind me. The nurse stood there. She didn't say a word, but there was a look in her eyes I'll never forget. Two days later my mother was dead.  Do you know who that nurse was?</utterance>

      <utterance>Phyllis. I tried to tell my father, but I was just a kid then and he wouldn't listen to me. Six months later she married him and I kind of talked myself out of the idea that she could have done anything like that. But now it's all back again, now that something has happened to my father, too.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yes, and two days before he fell off that train what was Phyllis doing? She was in her room in front of a mirror, with a black hat on, and she was pinning a black veil to it, as if she couldn't wait to see how she would look in mourning.</utterance>

      <utterance>About me. Walter, I'm a very great man. This Dietrichson business. It's murder, and murders don't come any neater. As fancy a piece of homicide as anybody ever ran into. Smart and tricky and almost perfect, but --</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>but, I think Papa has it all figured out, figured out and wrapped up in tissue paper with pink ribbons on it.</utterance>

   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You know what? That guy Dietrichson was never on the train.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

      <utterance>He wasn't?</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>No, he wasn't, Walter. Look, you can't be sure of killing a man by throwing him off a train that's going fifteen miles an hour. The only way you can be sure is to kill him first and then throw his body on the tracks. That would mean either killing him on the train, or -- and this is where it really gets fancy -- you kill him somewhere else and put him on the tracks. Two possibilities, and I personally buy the second.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>

   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look, it was like this. They killed the guy -- the wife and somebody else -- and then the somebody else took the crutches and went on the train as Dietrichson, and then the somebody else jumped off, and then they put the body on the tracks where the train had passed. An impersonation, see. And a cinch to work. Because it was night, very few people were about, they had the crutches to stare at, and they never really looked at the man at all.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

      <utterance>Is it? I tell you it fits together like a watch. And now let's see what we have in the way of proof.

   <speaker>JACKSON</speaker>

      <utterance>Fifty-one, according to the policy.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACKSON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The man I saw was nothing like fifty- one years old. Of course, it was pretty dark on that platform and, come to think of it, he tried to keep his back towards me. But I'm positive just the same.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's fine, Jackson. Now you understand this matter is strictly confidential. We may need you again down here in Los Angeles, if the case comes to court.</utterance>

      <utterance>All right, Mr. Jackson. Suppose you go down to the cashier's office -- room twenty-seven on the eleventh floor. They'll take care of your expense account and your ticket for the train tonight.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACKSON</speaker>

   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Jackson doesn't get it.</context>
      <utterance>Okay, Mr. Jackson. Just don't put her on the expense account.</utterance>
   <speaker>JACKSON</speaker>

      <utterance>Goodbye, gentlemen. A pleasure.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>

      <context>He puts a cigar in his mouth and starts tapping his pockets for matches.</context>
      <utterance>There it is, Walter. It's beginning to come apart at the seams already. A murder's never perfect. It always comes apart sooner or later. And when two people are involved it's usually sooner. We know the Dietrichson dame is in it, and somebody else. Pretty soon we're going to know who that somebody else is. He'll show. He's got to show. Sometime, somewhere, they've got to meet. Their emotions are all kicked up. Whether it's love or hate doesn't matter. They can't keep away from each other. They think it's twice as safe because there are two of them. But it's not twice as safe. It's ten times twice as dangerous. They've committed a murder and that's not like taking a trolley ride together where each one can get off at a different stop. They're stuck with each other. They've got to ride all the way to the end of the line. And it's a one-way trip, and the last stop is the cemetery.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She put in her claim and I'm going to throw it right back at her.  Have you got one of those? Neff strikes a match for him. Keyes takes the match out of his hand and lights his cigar.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Let her sue us if she dares. I'll be ready for her -- and that somebody else. They'll be digging their own graves.</utterance>

And I got to thinking what cemeteries are for. They're to put dead people in, I guess that was the first time I ever thought about Phyllis that way. Dead, I mean, and how things would be if she was dead. Because the way it was now she had me by the throat. She could hang me higher than a kite any day she felt like it. And there was nothing I could do, except hold my breath and watch that day come closer and closer, and maybe pray a little, if I still knew how to pray... I saw Lola three or four times that week. I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes, after what I had done, but it was only with her that I could relax and let go a little. Then one night we drove up into the hills above Hollywood Bowl...</utterance>

      <utterance>Memo to Mr. Norton. Confidential. Dietrichson File. With regard to your proposal to put Walter Neff under surveillance, I disagree absolutely. I have investigated his movements on the night of the crime, and he is definitely placed in his apartment from 7:15 P.M. on.

      <context></context>
      <utterance>...Furthermore, no connection whatsoever has been established between Walter Neff and Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson, whereas I am now able to report that such a connection has been established between her and another man. This man has been observed to visit the Dietrichson home on the night of July 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th. We have succeeded in identifying him as one Nino Zachetti, former medical student, aged twenty-eight, residing at Lilac Court Apartments 1228 N. La Brea Avenue. We have checked Zachetti's movements on the night of the crime and have found that they cannot be accounted for. I am preparing a more detailed report for your consideration and it is my belief that we already have sufficient evidence against Zachetti and Mrs. Dietrichson to justify police action. I strongly urge that this whole matter be turned over to the office of the District Attorney. Respectfully, Barton Keyes. Neff sits, staring blankly at the wall. The cylinder goes on revolving, but no more voice comes -- only the whir of the needle on the empty record. At last he remembers to replace the horn. He hangs it back on its hook. The machine stops. Neff gets up from the chair, walks slowly to the door and goes out.</utterance>

   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>

      <context>Out of the shot the gun explodes once, twice. Phyllis quivers in his arms. Her eyes fill with tears. Her head falls limp against his shoulder. Slowly he lifts her and carries her to the davenport. He lays her down on it carefully, almost tenderly. The moonlight coming in at the French doors shines on the anklet. He looks at it for the last time and slowly turns away. As he does so, he puts his hand inside his coat and it comes out with blood on it. Only then is it apparent that Phyllis' shot actually did hit him. He looks at the blood on his fingers with a dazed expression and quickly goes out of the room, the way he came.</context>
      <utterance>Goodbye, baby.</utterance>

      <context>Zachetti turns and approaches him slowly.</context>
      <utterance>Hey you. Come here a minute. I said come here, Zachetti.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The name is Neff.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZACHETTI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah? And I still don't like it. What do you want?</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He takes some loose change out of his pocket and holds out a coin.</context>
      <utterance>Look, kid, I want to give you a present.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Here's a nice new nickel.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZACHETTI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What's the gag?</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Neff starts to drop the nickel into Zachetti's handkerchief pocket. Zachetti knocks his hand away.</context>
      <utterance>Suppose you go back down the hill to a drug store and make a phone call.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZACHETTI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Keep your nickel and buy yourself an ice cream cone.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>

      <utterance>The number is Granite 0386. Ask for Miss Dietrichson. The first name is Lola.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZACHETTI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Lola? She isn't worth a nickel. And if I ever talk to her, it's not going to be over any telephone.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Tough, aren't you? Take the nickel. Take it and call her. She wants you to.</utterance>
   <speaker>ZACHETTI</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah? She doesn't want any part of me.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zachetti just stares at him. Neff moves again to put the nickel into Zachetti's pocket. This time Zachetti allows him to do it.</context>
      <utterance>I know who told you that, and it's not true. She's in love with you. Always has been. Don't ask me why. I couldn't even guess.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He motions toward the street below.</context>
      <utterance>Now beat it. Granite 0386, I told you.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Zachetti goes slowly past him. Neff grabs him and pushes him almost violently down the walk. Zachetti goes out of shot. The sound of his steps dies away as Neff looks after him. Then, far off in the distance, the SIREN OF A POLICE CAR is heard. Neff moves off through the shrubbery toward the side of the house where he parked his car.</context>
      <utterance>That way.</utterance>

      <context>Suddenly he stops his dictation with an instinctive feeling that he is not alone in the room. As he turns in his chair the CAMERA PULLS BACK slowly. The office door is wide open. Keyes is standing a few steps inside it. Behind him, on the balcony outside, stands the night watchman and the colored janitor, peering curiously into the room over Keyes' shoulder. Slowly, and without taking his eyes off Neff's face, Keyes reaches back and pushes the door shut. Neff hangs up the dictaphone horn. He looks at Keyes with a faint, tired grin and speaks very slowly.</context>
      <utterance>It's almost four-thirty now, Keyes. It's cold. I wonder if she's still lying there alone in that house, or whether they've found her by now. I wonder a lot of things, but they don't matter any more, except I want to ask you to do me a favor. I want you to be the one to tell Lola, kind of gently, before it breaks wide open... Yes, and I'd like you to look after her and that guy Zachetti, so he doesn't get pushed around too much. Because...</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Keyes moves towards him a few steps and stands without answering.</context>
      <utterance>Hello, Keyes.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Up pretty early, aren't you? I always wondered what time you got down to work. Keyes, staring at him, still does not answer.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Or did your little man pull you out of bed?</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The janitor did. Seems you leaked a little blood on the way in here.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Neff makes a motion indicating the used cylinders standing on the desk.</context>
      <utterance>Wouldn't be surprised.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I wanted to straighten out that Dietrichson story for you.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So I gather.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How long have you been standing there?</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Long enough.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it. One you didn't quite figure out.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You can't figure them all, Walter.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's right. You can't, can you? And now I suppose I get the big speech, the one with all the two- dollar words in it. Let's have it, Keyes.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're all washed up, Walter.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They stare at each other for a long moment, then, with intense effort Neff gets up on his feet and stands there swaying a little. His face is covered with sweat. His shoulder is bleeding. He is on the verge of collapse.</context>
      <utterance>Thanks, Keyes. That was short anyway.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Walter, I'm going to call a doctor.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What for? So they can patch me up? So they can nurse me along till I'm back on my feet? So I can walk under my own power into that gas chamber up in San Quentin? Is that it, Keyes?</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Something like that, Walter.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, I've got a different idea. Look here. Suppose you went back to bed and didn't find these cylinders till tomorrow morning, when the office opens. From then on you can play it any way you like. Would you do that much for me, Keyes?</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Give me one good reason.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I need four hours to get where I'm going.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You're not going anywhere, Walter.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You bet I am. I'm going across the border.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You haven't got a chance.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Good enough to try for.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You'll never make the border.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Neff starts to move towards the door, staggering a little, holding himself upright with great effort.</context>
      <utterance>That's what you think. Watch me.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Neff has reached the door. He twists the knob and drags the door open. He turns in it to look back at Keyes' implacable face.</context>
      <utterance>You'll never even make the elevator.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Neff goes out, leaving the door wide open. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS his staggering walk along the BALCONY TOWARDS THE ELEVATOR LOBBY. The sound of his breathing is so harsh and loud that for a moment it dominates the scene. Finally he reaches the swing doors leading into the lobby and starts to push them open. At this moment he collapses. He clutches the edge of the door and as it swings around with him he falls to the floor. He tries to struggle up but cannot rise. In background comes the sound of a telephone being dialed.</context>
      <utterance>So long, Keyes.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES' VOICE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>There is the sound of the phone being replaced in its cradle. Then there are footsteps growing louder along the balcony and Keyes walks slowly into the shot. He kneels down beside Neff.</context>
      <utterance>Hello... Send an ambulance to the Pacific Building on Olive Street... Yeah... It's a police job.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Neff manages a faint smile.</context>
      <utterance>How you doing, Walter?</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm fine. Only somebody moved the elevator a couple of miles away.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They're on the way.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You know why you didn't figure this one, Keyes? Let me tell you. The guy you were looking for was too close. He was right across the desk from you.</utterance>
   <speaker>KEYES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence.</context>
      <utterance>Closer than that, Walter.</utterance>
   <speaker>NEFF</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Neff fumbles for the handkerchief in Keyes' pocket, pulls it out and clumsily wipes his face with it. The handkerchief drops from his hand. He gets a loose cigarette out of his pocket and puts it between his lips. Then with great difficulty he gets out a match, tries to strike it, but is too weak. Keyes takes the match out of his hand, strikes it for him and lights his cigarette.</context>
      <utterance>I love you too.</utterance>
