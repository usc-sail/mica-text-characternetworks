      <utterance>It's already your interest or hobby. When they ask you "What's your interest or hobby?" at your Oxford interview, you can say, "Cello". That wouldn't be a lie. You don't need to practise a hobby. A hobby is a hobby.</utterance>

      <utterance>Ah, Elgar. I often think it's a shame he spent so much time in Worcester, don't you? Worcester's too near Birmingham. And you can hear that in the music. There's a horrible Brummy accent in there, if you listen hard enough.</utterance>

      <utterance>You make it sound as though it's an original. Do you like him?</utterance>

      <utterance>I can see my behaviour must have been... confusing. But we've never sat down and had a proper chat about it all. About the whys and wherefores. They can wait. The important thing is that you're still my Minnie Mouse, and I love you, and you had fun. You know you had fun.</utterance>

A young man stops behind her on his bike, dismounts, leans his bike against the wall next to hers, waits for her to finish. She turns her back on David, and the young man offers her his arm. They walk away together, and David stares longingly after them.</context>
      <utterance>Yes. I had fun. But I had fun with the wrong person, at all the wrong times. And I can't ever get those times back, now. Look, David. I'm in Oxford. Every day I wake up and pinch myself. And when I think how close I came...</utterance>
