      <utterance>Hot goddamn day!</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.</utterance>
   <speaker>MCGRAW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not even for lunch?</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>McGraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually every night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and joins Pete by the front counter.</context>
      <utterance>I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.</utterance>
   <speaker>MCGRAW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Whatsamatter?</utterance>
   <speaker>MCGRAW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?</utterance>
   <speaker>MCGRAW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.</utterance>
   <speaker>MCGRAW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?</utterance>
   <speaker>MCGRAW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Pete doesn't say anything.</context>
      <utterance>Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.</utterance>
   <speaker>MCGRAW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>McGraw drops his last drip of beer, crushes the can and exits in the bathroom. The black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and, with the prep school girl in tow, walks rapidly toward Pete. We see that the girl is crying.</context>
      <utterance>Knock yourself out.</utterance>
   <speaker>BLACK SUITED MAN #1</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Everybody speaks low and fast.</context>
      <utterance>Do you think I'm fuckin' playing with you, asshole?  Do you want this little girl to die?  Or that little girl? Or your bosombuddy with the badge? Or yourself? I don't wanna do it, but I'll turn this fuckin' store into the Wild Bunch if I even think you're fuckin' with me. The two men in black suits are the notorious Abilene bank robbers, SETH and RICHARD GECKO, "The Gecko Brothers." And the other customers are all being held hostage. Seth is the one with the prep girl. Richard is the one with the blonde.</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What do you want from me? I did what you said.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Richard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl, leans next to Seth's ear and whispers something. Seth looks at Pete.</context>
      <utterance>I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Were you giving that pig signals?</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Richard whispers something else in Seth's ear.</context>
      <utterance>What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He says you were scratching.</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I wasn't scratching!</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Pete controls himself.</context>
      <utterance>You callin' him a liar?</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to Seth.</context>
      <utterance>I'm not calling him a liar, okay? I'm simply saying that if I was scratching, and if I did scratch, it's not because I was signaling the cop, it's because I'm fuckin' scared shitless.</utterance>
   <speaker>RICHARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't I just go in there, blow his head off and get outta here.</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Don't do that! Look, you asked me to act natural, and I'm acting as natural -- in fact, under the circumstances, I think I ought get a fuckin' Academy Award for how natural I'm acting. You asked me to get rid of him, I'm doing my best.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The toilet FLUSHES.</context>
      <utterance>Yeah, well, your best better get a helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot worse.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Everybody goes back to what they were doing. McGraw steps back out of the back. He appears to be unaware of the situation.</context>
      <utterance>Everybody be cool.</utterance>
   <speaker>MCGRAW</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Out of nowhere Richard WHIPS out his forty-five automatic and SHOOTS McGraw in the head. McGraw goes down screaming. Richard stands over him and SHOOTS him twice more. Seth charges forward.</context>
      <utterance>Six-fifty.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What the fuck was that about?</utterance>
   <speaker>RICHARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He signaled the Ranger.</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I didn't.  You gotta believe me, I didn't.</utterance>
   <speaker>RICHARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>When they were talkin', he mouthed the words "Help Us."</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Richard SHOOTS Pete and Pete falls down behind the counter. Seth grabs Richard and throws him up against the wall.</context>
      <utterance>You fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit!</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What the fuck is wrong with you --</utterance>
   <speaker>RICHARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>While Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls out a gun from it. Seth releases his brother.</context>
      <utterance>Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face. And I saw him mouth: Richard mouths the words, "Help Us."</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Start the car.</utterance>
   <speaker>RICHARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You believe me don't cha?</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Richard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter... ...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in the hand. Richard FALLS to his knees, howling. Both Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire. Seth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads. Pete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads. Richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle. The two girls have run out screaming.</context>
      <utterance>Shut up and start the car.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Richie? You okay?</utterance>
   <speaker>RICHARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"</utterance>
   <speaker>PETE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I never said help us!</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!</utterance>
   <speaker>RICHARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah?</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!</utterance>
   <speaker>RICHARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Gotcha!</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The two brothers start FIRING toward the counter. They HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete. Pete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol RAIN down on him. Seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf. Richard keeps FIRING. Seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on fire with his Zippo, then tosses it. The flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air. The fireball lands behind the counter. The entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete screams from behind the counter. Seth smiles to himself and stands. Richard shakes his head in amusement and stands. Pete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES still holding his weapon and FIRING. Seth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's. Pete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess Pastry display. Seth and Richard rise from the rubble.</context>

   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?</utterance>
   <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.</utterance>

      <utterance>I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.</utterance>

      <utterance>I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit. Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?</utterance>

      <context>Everybody's happy.</context>
      <utterance>I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico.</utterance>

   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night.

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.</utterance>

      <utterance>Now wait a minute, there's no reason to get ugly. There's just a misunderstanding going on here. You said this bar is for truckers and bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver. Everybody looks at Jacob.</utterance>

      <context>Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at everyone in the party and smiles.</context>
      <utterance>If you look outside your door, parked in your parking lot, you'll see a big ass recreational vehicle. That's mine. In order to drive that legally, you need a class two driver's license. That is the same license that the DMV requires truck drivers to carry in order to drive a truck.  That is me, and this is my class two license. This is a truck driver's bar, I am a truck driver, and these are my friends. Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.</utterance>

      <context>Seth walks away, and the group follows him. We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor Charlie's head. The five of them move across the floor to a table. As they walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter. The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested, wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him. Richard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.</context>

      <utterance>Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she surveys. Jacob and Scott are embarrassed. Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power this woman has over a man she's deathly feared. Seth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping the beat with his guitar. Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what Seth and company did to Chet. Richard continues to suck her toes. The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks down at the seated Richard. She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds, none louder than Seth.</context>
      <utterance>Drink up.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe, which she puts on. Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.</context>

   <speaker>SANTANICO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Santanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.</context>
      <utterance>Muy bien, gracias.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The table laughs.</context>
      <utterance>Richie, you lucky bastard!  Now, little lady, you could of just as easily done that to me. Who a Nelly! You got my dick harder 'n Chinese arithmetic.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.</context>
      <utterance>Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red Riding Hood is walking through the forest and she comes across Little Bo Peep, and Little Bo Peep says: "Little Red Riding Hood, are you crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf is walking these woods and if he finds you he's gonna pull down your dress and squeeze your titties?" Then Little Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt and taps a .357 Magnum she has holstered on her thigh and says: "No he won't."</utterance>
   <speaker>JACOB</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, shit.  Seth -- Seth waves him away.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard, Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say anything -- The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.</context>
      <utterance>Not now. So finally she comes across the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad Wolf's laughing and says: "Little Red Riding Hood, you know better than to be walking around these woods alone. You know I'm just gonna have to pull down your dress and squeeze your titties." Then Little Red Riding Hood whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and says: "No you won't. You're gonna eat me, just like the story says."</utterance>
   <speaker>RAZOR CHARLIE</speaker>

      <utterance>Which one?</utterance>
   <speaker>CHET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>That's all Big Emilio has to hear.</context>
      <utterance>This piece of shit broke my finger and my nose...  then this fag kicked me in the ribs while I was down.</utterance>
   <speaker>BIG EMILIO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Up!</utterance>
   <speaker>RICHARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from his wounded shoulder. Santanico steps back from the table. Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor. Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake and SLASHES Seth across the face. Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to his laid open cheek. Richard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound, brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING. Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly before he hits the floor. Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay out of gunfire. The bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what they were doing. The music continues to play, though the dancers stop dancing. Santanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells something. Her NOSTRILS FLARE. Richard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief and puts it to his face.</context>
      <utterance>Fuck off, ape man!</utterance>
   <speaker>RICHARD</speaker>

      <utterance>Scarred for life, that's how I am!</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right... left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards the crowd.</context>
      <utterance>You thought it was pretty funny, didn't you?</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face. SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor. The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips. SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls to the floor, splattering. WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills her nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face could easily be read as intense sexual desire.</context>
      <utterance>Everybody be cool, or you'll be just as dead as these fucks!</utterance>

<dialogue id="31" n_utterances="7">
   <speaker>RICHARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He can't get a clear shot. Jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing. Richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico rides him down to the floor. Seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother. Richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about half way before he stops, saying:</context>
      <utterance>Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!</utterance>
   <speaker>RICHARD</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He tumbles over, a corpse.</context>
      <utterance>Fucking Bitch!</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet Pussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on their faces. The patrons scream. A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar and yells:</context>
      <utterance>Richie.</utterance>
   <speaker>WHORE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have turned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping</context>
      <utterance>Dinner is served!</utterance>
   <speaker>VAMPIRES.</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>What follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been sitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven necks. Naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other. Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size. The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the monsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades, anything. Jacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar. They hide and watch. Seth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand, too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands motionless, watching what he can't believe. Behind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard, eyes POP OPEN. She RISES in her snake/dance way. Seth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.</context>
      <utterance>The vamps attack.</utterance>
   <speaker>SANTANICO</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified. Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the FLOOR and INTO the WALL. A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps. Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the bar to the other. The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE, goes head to head with a stripper. The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the vamp bitch blow for blow. Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her on the wooden leg. FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie appears, straight razor in hand. Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half. Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of the cue in Razor Charlie's heart. Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the vampire's death scream. Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block placed on his chest.</context>

      <context>He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans. Seth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they see him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to Jacob.</context>
      <utterance>Noooooo!</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla walks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp out Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort. Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off Seth and Jacob. Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent. Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him look like a huge walking shark. Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He effortlessly knocks them away. They both hit the ground. Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to "come ahead." Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway locomotive. Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio, who HITS the floor. Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp, BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the savage beating.</context>

   <speaker>SEX MACHINE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into big vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and dies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead vamp. Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from around his mouth. Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears over the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his trouble. Chet dives at Kate.</context>

   <speaker>CHET</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Chet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees her crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of his head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips off her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening his mouth. She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll up back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>He plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being staked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief. By this time there are not too many people left. Most of the vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the customers have been butchered or drained. All that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding wooden stakes. The four human men group together. The four female vampires charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood. Seth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four staked bodies hit the floor. Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's side. They all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has taken place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.</context>

      <context>At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating everyone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills the air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense light, which lasts only a split second. It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies once lay. They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging. Except for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it. He takes his dead hand.</context>

      <context>Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away. He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.</context>

They all stand around the body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo. Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar. He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it.

      <context>Jacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area the bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other items to help secure and barricade the door. As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and the windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops open his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious activity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new friend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's putting a board into place. He springs to his feet and POUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the room in her direction.</context>
      <utterance>Give me a hand!</utterance>
   <speaker>SEX MACHINE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a scream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but she's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The others hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine, Big Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue. As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out of Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's heart. He dies and bursts into flames. At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting position. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the ground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.</context>

      <context>Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth. Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo. Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy. Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a while, then... BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the bat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a cup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's heart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of FLAMES, followed by a pile of goo. Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with the bat-thing. Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together, exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue to try and claw their way in.</context>

      <context>They thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all the bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing possum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me, listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after hour... As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE say:</context>
      <utterance>Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole with my entire squad dead. They thought they killed everybody, and except for me, they were right. But it wasn't for lack of trying. A grenade blew up right next to me, that's why I'm so pretty.</utterance>

      <context>"Who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. He turns around: nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to hear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says:</context>

      <context>Sex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing all the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are many voices, male, female, children saying:</context>

      <context>Sex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group in a thirsty way. He stares at each of their necks, closer and closer until he can see the veins on Frost's neck actually pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. Sex Machine has turned into a vampire.

      <context>Frost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off, straight at Sex Machine. Sex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and pulls it back, so he can really haul off. Frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face COLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him through the air. Seth sees where Frost is heading and says:</context>

Seth grabs the two kids by the hand and runs for the backroom. Behind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the ground. Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott, who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams, howls and snaps in fury. Seth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his .45 in its big mouth.</context>

And I wish we could sit here and cry till I pass on, but we can't. Because I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to turn into a monster. And when I do, I'm going to be dangerous. But before that happens, just know I love you.  Now, I'd say in the next twenty or thirty minutes our friends outside will bust in this door. And I'll probably turn into a vampire within the hour. Now, you have two choices. You can wait for me to turn, then deal with me, then wait for them to burst inside here and the three of you will deal with them. Or, we can kick open that door and the four of us can hit 'em with everything we have, and carve a path right through 'em to front entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em, we gotta go at 'em now. I confused them, I scared them, I took them off guard. But they're going to get unconfused, they're going to get unscared, they're going to get together and they're going to hit that door like a ton of bricks. And when that moment arrives, we gotta be ready. Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled with boxes and crates.</utterance>

They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards the door. Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in green vamp blood. Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the other. Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit. Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and toss them into the crowd. They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming in pain. From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and HURLS toward the group. Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES. The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.

      <context>Cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the bar. Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in fiery death. Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons. As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He can't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts to hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices the vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow. His eyes are yellow. Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster. Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood. Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and SMASHES it against Jacob's head. The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor. Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it up to fire. A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares with the boy he once called his son. Scott's eyes turn to steel.</context>

      <context>He FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead, creating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire head bursts into flames, then explodes. From across the room, Fate sees her daddy ignite. She cries out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:</context>

      <context>The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit.

Kate stands holding the .45, arm outstretched.</context>

Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first vampire's head that gets in swinging distance. Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched vamps scream like they've never screamed before.</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and Seth with a safe, lighted area. The .45's empty. The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being able to get at them. The two survivors hold hands, when... All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on from the outside. The vamps look towards it in horror. From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a Spanish accent.</context>

      <utterance>Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLOS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Twenty-eight.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.</context>
      <utterance>Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH AND CARLOS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over to a red 1990 Porsche 911.</context>
      <utterance>Twenty-five.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLOS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You like the car?</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I said new, this is an '90.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLOS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>That's like new.</context>
      <utterance>It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So do I just follow you?</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLOS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, follow us.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So let's do it.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARLOS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Carlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes. Seth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate. Kate stands alone. The whole desert seems between them. So much to say ... but no words.</context>
      <utterance>Vamanos!</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm sorry.</utterance>
   <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Long pause.</context>
      <utterance>Me too.</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>See ya.</utterance>
   <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Seth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate says behind him:</context>
      <utterance>Later.</utterance>
   <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>Seth turns around.</context>
      <utterance>Seth.</utterance>
   <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Seth smiles.</context>
      <utterance>You want some company?</utterance>
   <speaker>SETH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Kate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and begins her long walk home.</context>
      <utterance>Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But I'm not a fuckin' bastard. He blows her a kiss across the desert. She blows one back. Seth's in his car and GONE.</utterance>
