      <utterance>We have all this height, Sam. We could add a second floor and put our bedroom upstairs. That would leave all this space.</utterance>

      <context>Sam glances down at his white body. They all laugh.</context>
      <utterance>Sam, this may be none of my business, but I'm concerned you're doing too much coke.</utterance>
   <speaker>MOLLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sam obeys. Molly doodles on his chest, drawing a bow tie and the outline of a tuxedo jacket. Her lines are quick, accomplished, and subtly erotic.</context>
      <utterance>Hey, Sam, turn around.</utterance>
   <speaker>CARL</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Molly nods. She reaches out and superimposes an armless female torso over his. His stomach jumps sensually as she touches it. Molly pulls back to admire her work. He looks like a Greek statue.</context>

      <context>In unison, they hit it once more. A massive section of plaster and metal topples to the ground. New clouds of dust fill the air. Suddenly, Sam spies an old jar lying on the floor. Something rattles inside it, a penny.</context>
      <utterance>All together now. One,  two,  three.</utterance>
   <speaker>SAM</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

   <speaker>MOLLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She glances at him lovingly. Carl looks at the two of them and grins. As the dust settles we see, for the first time, the outlines of the space they are working in. It is a huge loft over four thousand square feet. Banks of windows run east and west. Molly steps back and admires the room.</context>
      <utterance>You're the good omen.</utterance>

      <context>Sam seems preoccupied.</context>
      <utterance>Oh, by the way, Sam, I had to move your 3:00 with Bob Kahan to 4:00 so you could squeeze in Gary Alan. He called yesterday and said he has to see you today about the Danway stuff. Three o'clock was the only time he could make it. Also, the board meeting in L.A. has been confirmed for the 12th. I got you on a 9:00 a.m. flight.</utterance>

      <context>He sneezes. People on the elevator freeze.</context>
      <utterance>He said it was contagious. Very contagious. I shouldn't be going into work today.  But what could I do?</utterance>

      <context>A SECRETARY enters the room and hands Sam a piece of paper. It reads "MOLLY ON LINE 2. URGENT." She hands him a phone. Sam looks surprised. He nods apologetically to his guests.</context>
      <utterance>I'm afraid that's the only Japanese I know. But I realize it's not our language fluency, or lack of it, that brings you to Market Security. Rather, I'm sure, it is our banking expertise, our ability to represent and anticipate all of your banking needs. As you know, we are not the largest banking establishment in New York.  But, with combined assets of over 200 billion dollars, we have a firm commitment to the international marketplace.</utterance>

Quickly he jumps back, grabs hold of it, and brings it in. The workmen applaud. Molly eyes him with admiration. Suddenly we hear a voice call out.</context>

He lays the thick folder on the desk and opens it up. She hurries over to him.</context>

Sam approaches the computer, hesitates a moment, and then pushes the power switch. The computer CLICKS back on. Carl spins around.

With great tenderness, she puts her arms around him and before he knows what is happening, they are dancing. It is a strange, touching image, reminiscent of their first night in their new home.

Arm in arm, supporting one another, they walk quietly from the room.</context>
