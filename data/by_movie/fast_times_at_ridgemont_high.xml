   <speaker>LINDA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Through the entrance, we see Stacy Hamilton. She is the fifteen-year-old trainee, sweet-looking with just the last traces of baby fat. She puts down a glass of water for Ron, spills some and mops it up.</context>
      <utterance>No, be cool, that's Stacy's section.</utterance>
   <speaker>WAITRESS #1</speaker>
      <mode></mode>

   <speaker>LINDA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She fluffs up Stacy's hair and gently shoves her towards the door. Stacy reluctantly exits.</context>
      <utterance>Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.</utterance>
   <speaker>RON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>So you working hard or hardly working? Stacy thinks it over, decides it's a joke and laughs . Ron looks at her soulfully.</utterance>

      <utterance>You look like you could still be in high school.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.</utterance>

      <utterance>I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>I have but one question for you on our first morning 'together.'  Can you attend my class? Pakalo?... Understand?... History has proven us one basic fact. Man does not do anything that is not for his own good. It is for your own good that you attend my class. And if you can't make it... I can make you. An impatient knock begins at the front door of the classroom.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. HAND</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>The knock continues.</context>
      <utterance>We have a twenty-question quiz every Friday. It will cover all the material we've dealt with during the week. There will be no make-up exams. It's important that you all have your Land of Truth and Liberty textbooks by Wednesday. At the latest.</utterance>

      <context>The mystery knocker tries a lazy calypso beat on the front door. No one in Mr. Hand's U.S. History class dares mention it, much less answer it. Stacy grips her desk with the tension of her first day.</context>
      <utterance>Your grade is the average of all your quizzes, plus the midterm and final, which counts for one-third. Got it?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. HAND</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Hand finally turns, as if he has just noticed the sound at the door and opens the door an inch. Jeffrey Spicoli stands in the doorway, red eyes glistening. His long, blond hair is still wet and streaming down the back of his white peasant shirt. He grins, oblivious to such trivial matters as attendance bells. A Student sitting near Stacy turns to his friends.</context>
      <utterance>Also. There will be no eating in this class. You get used to doing your own business on your own time. That's one demand I make. I don't like staying after class with you on detention. That's my time. I don't like wasting it. Just like you wouldn't want me to come to your house some evening and discuss U.S. History on your time. Pakalo?</utterance>
