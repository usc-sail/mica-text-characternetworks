      <context>Bruce SNAPS from pissed to instant charismatic TV newsman. (Note: Whenever Bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his "REPORTER'S VOICE" - that recognizable, too-smooth delivery that all news reporters seem to have. In mathematical terms Bruce's version is to the 7th power.)</context>

      <utterance>For three decades the Kowolski Family Bakery has been a mainstay in downtown Buffalo. Known for their sinfully rich, cream filled, deep fried polski pierogis. And the occasional sugar induced coma that follows. Today, in honor of their 30 year anniversary, Momma Kowolski and her sons Gustov and Vol, decided to do something, a little bit different. Tell me guys, how did this idea come about?</utterance>
   <speaker>GUSTOV</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, Vol said to me, 'Gustov, why don't we make the biggest chocolate chip cookie in Buffalo?' And I said, 'Yeah, sure.'</utterance>
   <speaker>BRUCE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Bruce steps up to the HUGE COOKIE.</context>
      <utterance>Wow. Fascinating.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRUCE</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The Kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background, toasting with big mugs of milk. Bruce steps forward, looks dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks.</context>
      <utterance>The previous Buffalo cookie record was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by Gladys Pelsnick. But this behemoth cookie clearly proving that Gustov and Vol have much more free time.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRUCE</speaker>

      <utterance>As we witness the ceremonial toasting with milk it makes one pause and think. What are we really looking at here?</utterance>

      <utterance>Is it just a big cookie or does this cookie represent the pride of Buffalo? Our dedicated and hard working citizens the key ingredient, with a few nuts thrown in.  And finally, the love of our families which provides the warm chewy center making our beloved Buffalo the sweetest place to live.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRUCE</speaker>
      <mode>CONT'D</mode>
      <context>Bruce's hair net SLIPS UP, PUFFING HIS HAIR INTO A BUN ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD. The Kowolskis and bystanders all laugh. The frame FREEZES. We PULL BACK from the TV and find Bruce holding the remote, watching the recorded spot on TV. We are now...</context>

That, of course, only a formality as in a bizarre twist, the body was found buried with a birth certificate and complete set of dental records.
