      <context>Instead of following her directions to the Men's Room, Kyle wanders toward the drinking fountain. A bunch of kids are running around and throwing water at each other with paper cups. Reese shambles through them like a zombie. He stands among the children, an alien in this land without fear. He watches people at picnic tables laughing and listening to portable music. Kids squeal. Dogs bark.</context>

   <speaker>LITTLE GIRL</speaker>

      <context>DOWN ANGLE on an achingly beautiful LITTLE GIRL of about four. She points above his head. Reese looks up to see a helium-filled mylar balloon stuck in the foliage of a tree just above him. He pulls it down by the string and holds it, turning it over dully. He crouches down to her eye-level. She smiles.</context>
      <utterance>Can you get my balloon?</utterance>

      <context>Reese whirls reflexively at a SCREAM behind him. The mylar balloon bursts in his tense hands. A teenage girl is being doused with water by the boys with plastic jugs. The little girl looks at the broken balloon, then glares at Reese. She punches him soundly on the shoulder and storms off. At this moment she is bowled over by an IRISH SETTER that licks her face while she shrieks with laughter. Reese seems about to smile but doesn't quite know how to go about it.</context>

   <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
      <mode>V.O.</mode>
      <context>COVER SHOT reveals Sarah as the wheel of a dusty landrover parked at the pump island of a tiny gas station. All of its signs are in hand-lettered Spanish. Beyond lies an expanse of scrub desert. The sky scowls with an impending storm. Sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark- complected attendant laconically fills her tank. She cradles the cassette recorder in her lap, in the lee of her SWOLLEN BELLY. She looks to be about SIX MONTHS ALONG. Under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster and the butt of a .357 REVOLVER presses against her breast. She tugs the vest closed as the attendant glances her way. A German Shepherd sits in the back among taped boxes and suitcases.</context>
      <utterance>...and the hardest thing is deciding what I should tell you and what not to. Well, anyway, I've got a while yet before you're old enough to understand the tapes. They're more for me at this point... to help get it all straight.</utterance>
   <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>CLICK. WHIR. Sarah jumps at a sound nearby, breaking her reverie. A small MEXICAN BOY has snapped her picture with a beat-up Polaroid camera. He holds it out to her, speaking rapid Spanish.</context>
      <utterance>Should I tell you about your father? That's a tough one. Will it change your decision to send him here...knowing? But if you don't send Kyle, you could never be. God, you can go crazy thinking about all this...I suppose I'll tell you...I owe him that. And maybe it'll be enough if you know that in the few hours we had together we loved a lifetime's worth...</utterance>
   <speaker>ATTENDANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>He says you are very beautiful, Senora, and he is ashamed to ask five American dollars for this picture, but if he does not, his father will beat him.</utterance>
   <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The boy takes her four dollars and she watches the snapshot develop. It is a good photograph of her, the wind lightly ruffling her hair, expression thought- ful, slightly sad. We recognize it as the one Reese carried in 2029. She slips it into her short pocket.</context>
      <utterance>That's a pretty good hustle, kid. Four. Quatro.</utterance>
   <speaker>ATTENDANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The boy yells something in Spanish as he runs off.</context>
      <utterance>Mil trescientos...fifteen dollars American. As she pays him, distant thunder rolls.</utterance>

      <utterance>What did he say?</utterance>
   <speaker>ATTENDANT</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the desert. Heat lightning pulses in their depths.</context>
      <utterance>There is a storm coming in.</utterance>
