      <utterance>Where the hell have you been?  Mom, come on and eat.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'm not hungry.</utterance>
   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mary is a manic-depressive, still in her bathrobe at six in the evening.</context>
      <utterance>Then why'd I cook!</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Fay holds her head in her hands and sighs. She glares at her brother.</context>
      <utterance>I don't know why you cooked! I don't know why you bother!</utterance>
   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon sits at the table and Fay slams down before him a bowl of some sort of gruel. He hesitates, then lifts his spoon. Supper is horrible and he screws up his face in disgust. Fay gives him a sideways glance and he leans back down over the bowl and eats some more. Pushing the bowl away gently, he reaches out for the container of milk on the table and drinks straight from it. He suddenly jumps back and spits out sour milk all over the table. The container drops to the floor and thick globs of cheese roll out. He stands back against the fridge, holding his stomach while... Fay and Mary look on in disgust.</context>
      <utterance>Sit down and eat, Simon.</utterance>
   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Fay snaps shut her compact, straightens her skirt and sighs.</context>
      <utterance>God, I wanna get fucked.</utterance>
   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon loses track of what he is hearing and relaxes. He looks back at his sister. Fay fluffs out her hair and walks off.</context>
      <utterance>You OK?</utterance>
   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon watches her go, but is still drawn to something he seems to hear up the street in the other direction. He cocks his head, sits perfectly still and listens. He hears it now. We do, too. Footsteps. Big ones. Like a giant somewhere in the distance. The neighborhood trembles. Titles begin. Simon tries to figure out where it's coming from; the sky, the house, the highway at the end of his block... Finally, he focuses on... The blacktop right before him, smeared with his own blood. Music starts. He kneels out slowly into the street and stares at the pavement. He stretches out his hand and places it flat on the road. The pounding is louder now, becoming the beat of the music over the scene. Simon lowers his face to the pavement, closes his eyes and... Puts his ear right down against the road. He hears... The steady tread of somebody very much larger than life. Kneeling forward, with his ear to the ground, Simon opens his eyes and sees... A man approaching. The music swells up full. Simon lifts his head slowly from the road, looking off in wonder at... This stranger coming towards him; an oddly handsome freak striding over the crest of the distant intersection with a windswept mane, two over-stuffed suitcases and a crumpled tie fluttering back over his broad but crooked shoulders. Simon rises till he's kneeling up straight in the road. Henry Fool finally reaches him and stops. Titles finish. Simon says nothing and watches as Henry looks off at the house. Satisfied, but wary, Henry Fool looks around the neighborhood and then down at Simon.</context>
      <utterance>See ya later.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He tosses the suitcases down in front of Simon and walks off towards his new home.</context>
      <utterance>Get up off your knees.</utterance>

   <speaker>AMY</speaker>

      <utterance>Say something.</utterance>
   <speaker>WARREN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She's mute.</utterance>
   <speaker>AMY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What?</utterance>
   <speaker>WARREN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Amy looks back at Gnoc, snarls, then follows the cashier's gaze to the door. Simon enters. Clutching Henry's cash, he stops dead in his tracks when he sees... Warren and Amy. He steps forward and approaches the beer cooler. Warren and Amy hover around, just out of reach, like a couple of vampires. Dragging a six-pack out of the cooler, Simon crosses to the counter. Warren and Amy hang back, silent and threatening. Gnoc rings up the purchase and glances over at... Amy, staring a hole into the side of Simon's skull. Gnoc hands Simon back his change and he makes for the door, but... Warren shoves himself between it and Simon. Simon freezes. Warren is expressionless. Simon looks back at Amy. She turns away, reaches up under her skirt, jerks down her panties, then leans forward on to the counter. Leering back over her shoulder, she hisses...</context>
      <utterance>She don't -- you know -- talk.</utterance>
   <speaker>AMY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon is nonplussed. Gnoc presses a button on the wall that sets... A red light flashing above the stockroom door. Warren grabs Simon by the neck and drags him over to Amy's bare behind. Amy laughs as Simon is forced to his knees and has his face shoved up right into the crack of her ass. But then... Simon throws up all over her. Warren falls back in disgust. Gnoc covers her face with her hands. Amy looks around at herself, realizes, and starts screaming bloody murder. Simon falls back on to the floor, clutching his stomach, as Amy staggers around with her vomit-strewn underwear down around her ankles. Then Gnoc's father, Mr Deng, appears at the stockroom door holding a shovel and ready to fight.</context>
      <utterance>Kiss my ass.</utterance>
   <speaker>WARREN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mr Deng comes running at them and Warren drags Amy from the store. Simon crawls out of the way as the old man throws open the door to the parking lot and screams at the retreating delinquents...</context>
      <utterance>Oh, shit!</utterance>
   <speaker>MR DENG</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look at this! What's going on here? Simon, get up off the floor! Is this beer paid for?</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Where do you come from?</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He winks at Simon, then struts around the room, hugely impressed with himself.</context>
      <utterance>Nowhere in particular.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I go where I will and I do what I must.  That's why I'm in trouble. I'm sort've what you might call... 'in exile'.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why are you in trouble?</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Henry pauses, looks aside, drinks, then grins demoniacally. He steps forward and comes face to face with Simon. He lifts his finger and points to... Simon's name stitched upon the breast of his work shirt. Realizing this, Simon moves off and thinks. Henry throws more wood on the fire, glancing back over his shoulder, laughing mischievously.</context>
      <utterance>How do you know my name?</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I am not retarded.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well... I'll take your word for that.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon looks at him. Henry stands and grabs a notebook from off the mantelpiece. He tears out a few pages and shoves them in his pocket. He hands the now fresh writing tablet to Simon.</context>
      <utterance>I see.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He searches his pockets and finds a pencil.</context>
      <utterance>Here. Take this. And...</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon hesitates, then accepts the gifts. Henry goes for another beer while his new friend studies the dozens of notebooks on the mantelpiece.</context>
      <utterance>...this. Keep them with you at all times. You ever feel like you got something to say and you can't get it out, stop and write it down. OK?</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What are these?</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>This? This is my life's work. My memoirs. My 'Confession'.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Henry drinks and looks down into the raging fire.</context>
      <utterance>What have you done?</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I've been bad. Repeatedly.  But why brag? The details of my exploits are only a pretext for a far more expansive consideration of general truths.  What is this? It's a philosophy. A poetics. A politics, if you will. A literature of protest. A novel of ideas. A pornographic magazine of truly comic-book proportions. It is, in the end, whatever the hell I want it to be. And when I'm through with it, it's gunna blow a hole this wide straight through the world's own idea of itself! He smokes. Simon is impressed. They hear a bottle smash outside in the street and Henry goes to the window. They're throwing bottles at the house.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon jumps up.</context>
      <utterance>Come on, let's go break their arms!</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Henry stops. Simon looks away and sits back down.</context>
      <utterance>No!</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Henry sees this and settles down. He considers his new friend with genuine care as he gets himself a new cigarette. He lights up, thinks, then grabs another chair and sits close by Simon. They sit there in silence a while, then...</context>
      <utterance>If I'm quiet. He is ashamed of himself.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Henry stares into the flames and falls silent. Simon is riveted. He leans forward, on the edge of his seat...</context>
      <utterance>Once. I forget where I was. Central America maybe. Somewhere hot. Stupid job. Bad pay. Dangerous location and water so foul the natives wouldn't even piss in it. This crowd of drunken motherfuckers hired by the local drug cartel shows up at my hotel room and threatens to tear me limb from limb. And I say, listen, hombres, OK, you've got me outnumbered four to one and you're gunna kill me here tonight and not a soul in this dimly lit world is ever gunna notice I'm gone. Fine. But one of you... one of you... one of you is gunna have his eye torn out. Period. Silence. I repeat myself. One of you poor, underpaid jerks is gunna have an eye ripped out of its socket. I promise. It's a small thing, perhaps, all things considered. But I will succeed. Because it's the only thing I have left to do in this world. So why don't you just take a good look at one another one last time and think it over for a few minutes more.  They sober up a little, look at their shoes in confusion, then step out into the hall to talk among themselves.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What happened?</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Well, here I am, still, after all.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon says nothing. He looks down at his feet.</context>
      <utterance>They were throwing bottles at the house.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She's got some ex-con in there she met at the bar. Tattoos all over himself and a big red bloated nose.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Now she says nothing. She smokes and looks away. Simon steps into the bathroom and gets her medication. He runs a glass of water and brings it in to her. She swallows the pills and washes them back with water.</context>
      <utterance>Did you take your pills?</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She looks away, unconcerned and cynical.</context>
      <utterance>You want me to tell her to be quiet?</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She throws the blanket over herself and turns off the light. Simon stands there in the dark.</context>
      <utterance>What's the use? She might as well get it while she can. She's not always gunna have the ass she has now, you know. That's just how life is.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon rubs the sleep from his eyes, blinks, disoriented and reaches for his wallet.</context>
      <utterance>Good morning, Simon! Glorious day, huh? Here, have a donut. Can you lend me twenty dollars?</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thanks. Where's the library in the scruffy little burgh?</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Down the highway about a mile and a half and then make a left.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He lifts up Simon's notebook.</context>
      <utterance>Excellent! I'm polishing up the final chapters of my 'Confession' and I need a reasonably well-stocked reference section.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon hesitates, shyly.</context>
      <utterance>What's this?</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He gives up, sighs and gazes at the floor. Henry flips through the book, impressed. It is full from cover to cover, every page dense with Simon's cryptic scrawl. Henry frowns, intrigued. Then...</context>
      <utterance>I thought. Um. I was. I wanted to. Maybe.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon looks up, terrified. But his friend puts him at ease.</context>
      <utterance>Can I take this?</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I'll correct the spelling.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>One of you is gunna lose an eye! Warren stops. Amy steps back and lowers the gas can. Simon turns with effort to face them, adjusts his glasses and continues...</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Warren watches him blankly, then is burned by the torch which is too hot to handle. He drops it. Amy giggles, then stops, excited, but confused. Simon grips the rusted chainlink so that it cuts into his hands and stares straight at Warren.</context>
      <utterance>One of you. I promise.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Warren is transfixed. He shivers and looks at Amy, who steps back, scared, and puts down the gas can. She turns and walks away. Warren looks back at Simon, troubled. He hangs there still, glaring at him. Further away, Warren rejoins Amy and stares at his hands. Amy looks ill.</context>
      <utterance>You can set me on fire. But one of you is gunna have an eye torn out of your head. I promise.</utterance>
   <speaker>WARREN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Fuck.</utterance>
   <speaker>AMY</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Take me home.</utterance>

      <utterance>I told them. Like you said. I told them. And I knew I could do it.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR DENG</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Henry nods, agreeing, then lifts Simon off the floor. Mr Deng holds the door open as Henry carries his friend out into the parking lot. Meanwhile, Gnoc gathers up the classics from the floor and places them beside Simon's notebook, where it still sits open on the table. She looks at it, then reads. She lifts it off the table and reads further, immediately and deeply engrossed. Mr Deng watches as Henry departs with Simon, then comes back into the store and stops, startled, when he sees... Gnoc sitting there, staring off into space, the notebook open in her hands before her, singing quietly.</context>
      <utterance>You should take him home. He smells like a toilet.</utterance>

      <utterance>It won't happen again.</utterance>
   <speaker>MARY</speaker>

      <context>He stops and lifts a small framed photo of a soldier off the piano.</context>

   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Violated somehow, she gets up and snatches it out of his hands. She puts it in a drawer and cringes as Henry plays one note on the piano.</context>

   <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He fixes her with a steady, knowing stare which causes her to gather the collar of her bathrobe up around her neck. She steps back, exposed, when there's a knock at the door. They look over to see... Mr Deng enter with the notebook.</context>

      <utterance>Look, in my opinion, this is pretty powerful stuff. Though your spelling is Neanderthal, and your reasoning a little naive, your instincts are profound. But the whole thing needs to be given a more cohesive shape. It can be expanded. Followed through. Unified.  You see what I'm getting at? Simon just stares at him, overwhelmed. Henry drops the</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon just blinks, looks away and wonders.</context>
      <utterance>Are you willing to commit yourself to this? To really work on it? To give it its due? In the face of adversity and discouragement? To rise to the challenge you yourself have set?</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>

      <utterance>Yes.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon nods and stares at the ceiling. Henry hands him a towel.</context>

      <utterance>What's that?</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon nods. Henry grabs hold of the arm, swallows and braces himself. Simon waits, then Henry tugs the arm straight.</context>
      <utterance>Okay. You ready?</utterance>

      <context>Fay turns and runs down the stairs. Mary backs away into her room and shuts the door.</context>

   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They drink again in silence. He lights her cigarette and they watch each other closely. Finally, Fay leans on the table and twirls a strand of her hair between her fingers.</context>
      <utterance>No.</utterance>
   <speaker>FAY</speaker>

      <utterance>I don't know. Young.</utterance>
   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He drinks and studies her. She presents her profile. Finally, he leans back.</context>
      <utterance>But how... I mean, do I look more like twenty, or... you know, thirty?</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Fay jumps up, furious.</context>
      <utterance>Thirty.</utterance>
   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She grabs her bag and storms out of the house. Henry watches her go, then chuckles deviously and splashes himself another drink.</context>

      <utterance>He wants to win back this country for us Americans, Warren, and restore some kind of cultural-moral standard to our way of life.</utterance>

      <utterance>See, Simon, there are three kinds of there. There's 'There'. T-H-E-R-E. There are the donuts. Then there's T- H-E-I-R; which is the possessive. It is their donut. Then, finally, there's 'they're'. T-H-E-Y-'-R-E. A contraction, meaning they are. They're the donut people. Get it?</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>And look, if you're gunna read Wordsworth you've gotta get a more up-to-date edition. This odoriferous tome you're so attached to doesn't even have all fourteen books of the Prelude. And you need notes. Commentary. I'll go to the library and find you the best edition they have.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Thank you, but that's OK. I'll stop there on my way back from work. Well, yes, maybe not today, but, you know, tomorrow, probably.</utterance>

   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why?</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You need time to write, Simon. To study. To reflect.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>But I like my job.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon looks past him and Henry follows his gaze to find... Mary standing at the foot of the stairs, listening to them. She says nothing. She looks Henry up and down, then shakes her head disdainfully and grunts. She throws herself on the couch and turns on the TV, casting acid glances over at the kitchen.</context>
      <utterance>We all have to make sacrifices. A vocation like ours, Simon, is not a nine to five thing. You can't put a fence around a man's soul. We think and feel where and when we can think and feel. We are the servants of our muse and we toil where she commands.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>She's clinically depressed.</utterance>

   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>

      <context>Mary looks at Fay, who looks up from her magazine and considers her brother. Then they break out laughing. Simon looks on. They laugh and laugh and laugh...</context>

   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mary is lying on the couch. She drags her eyes from the TV and glances lazily at Fay, then back to the TV.</context>
      <utterance>Ma, you take your medication?</utterance>
   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She sits at the kitchen table and lifts her magazine. Henry shows up at the kitchen door with a pile of library books. His eyes brighten when he sees... Fay sitting there wearing only her towel. He knocks. She looks back over her shoulder and sees him.</context>
      <utterance>Guess so.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Evening, Fay.</utterance>
   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>What do you want?</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She turns away.</context>
      <utterance>I've got these books for Simon.</utterance>
   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He comes in and stacks the books near the sink. Fay pretends to ignore him, but rakes her fingers through her wet hair anyway, to show more shoulder. This is not lost on Henry, who tarries and leans back against the counter, salivating. Fay flips through her magazine and Henry steps closer and leans against the fridge. She casts a bored glance in his direction, then returns her attention to the TV. She senses him step aside and follows his movements without turning. Suddenly his hand appears from behind her and gently strokes her hair. She freezes, waits, wonders... He leans his face down beside her. She looks at him. He looks at her, then down to... Her bare legs crossed before her on the kitchen chair. His hand moves down and slides itself deep in between her things. Her mouth drops open. He looks back up at her. He grins. Fay jumps up and away, breathlessly clutching the towel around herself. Henry casts a glance over her body, throws his hair back out of his face and shivers with lust. Fay steps back and grabs hold of the staircase banister, making an unconvincing gesture of injured pride. Henry comes closer and she steps backwards up the stairs. He stops, loosens his tie, holding her with his gaze. She readjusts her towel, throws back her wet hair, sighs defiantly, then sashays into her room, leaving the door ajar. Henry waits there at the foot of the stairs, reaches down, grabs his crotch and repositions his hard-on. He takes a step up the stairs, then stops. He looks over to the couch and sees... Mary, lying there, sedately amazed. He pauses, then grins. Mary blinks and smiles sleepily.</context>
      <utterance>Well, leave 'em there on the counter, then.</utterance>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon hesitates, but then nods uncertainly. Warren hands him a flyer. This year when you go to the polls, I want you to consider Congressman Owen Feer. He wants to restore America to its position of unmatched wealth, power and opportunity; to revitalize American civilization and lead the human race to even greater levels of freedom, prosperity and security! He's a good man. He steps over to the register and pays for his beer. Mr Deng glares at him, distrustfully. Warren stops on his way out and snarls at the old man...</context>
      <utterance>Hey, Simon, you a registered voter?</utterance>
   <speaker>WARREN</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He leaves. Simon looks down and studies the flyer.</context>

   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>She opens the door and looks out into the hall. He's not there. She steps out into the hall and listens.</context>
      <utterance>Where is he?</utterance>
   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Nothing. She comes to the top of the stairs and hears faint activity from down below. She proceeds downstairs. She sees no one in the kitchen, then looks in the living- room and stops. She goes white, her mouth falling open in horror. Henry and Mary are screwing one another on the couch. Sloppy, impassioned, brute sex.</context>
      <utterance>Henry?</utterance>
   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>They fall away from each other in terror and fatigue. Mary clutches wildly at her bathrobe as Henry falls over the coffee table, stumbles to his feet and pulls up his trousers. Fay is crushed. She breaks out in tears and runs upstairs. Henry catches his breath and starts after her, but stops, uncertain and confused.</context>

      <context>He drinks, burps, then slams down the can. He glances over at Tim who is still looking on.</context>
      <utterance>We're outsiders. We think and feel too much and too deeply. And the world can't handle that. Our mere existence is a threat to its illusion of security. Sure, they'll name a wing of a new library after us when we're dead! But now... Now, when we're alive... Now, they wanna burn us at the stake!</utterance>

   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He hears something, stands and moves further into the church. Simon hesitates, but then follows. They hear someone crying. Finally, in a pew off to one side in the shadows, they find... A young priest named Father Hawkes. He's a wreck. He looks up from his quiet sobbing and sees... Henry and Simon standing there looking on with embarrassed distaste. He lowers his head in shame. Henry moves closer and sits beside the distraught priest.</context>
      <utterance>Shhh!</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>The priest sighs hopelessly.</context>
      <utterance>What's wrong?</utterance>
   <speaker>FATHER HAWKES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Henry leans back with a sigh and reaches for his cigarettes.</context>
      <utterance>I doubt.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He offers a cigarette to the priest and he accepts.</context>
      <utterance>So, you're an honest man. Why beat yourself up about it?</utterance>
   <speaker>FATHER HAWKES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't know if there are grounds for faith. Is my vocation relevant? Does it make a difference?</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>A difference in what?</utterance>
   <speaker>FATHER HAWKES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>The world. The way it is. Is this a way to help relieve suffering?</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Your vocation makes a difference.</utterance>
   <speaker>FATHER HAWKES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>How can you be so sure?</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Because vocation is the difference. Only someone who really cares doubts. Listen, father, as I was about to tell my friend Simon here, I am, without doubt, the biggest sinner within a hundred miles of this parish. But still, I've gotta stay up late at night to outdo the unending parade of mundane little atrocities I see committed every day right out in the open spaces of this loud and sunlit culture we call home.</utterance>
   <speaker>FATHER HAWKES</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>You seem to me to be a sensitive and generous man.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I like to think so. But the fact is I appreciate depravity. Nevertheless, I insist your vocation makes a difference, because to hold out anything other than a spiritual yardstick to reality is to be jerking off grandly into the abyss. Listen, have you got any money? Let's go have a drink.</utterance>

   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon waits for more but is disappointed. With one final cracked grin at his friend, Henry throws back his shoulders, slicks back his hair and strides off. Simon watches him go and frowns, not comforted. He flips through the pages of Paradise Lost.</context>

      <utterance>Why is it this beautiful girl makes me sad? Does she know how beautiful she is? Do people tell her? Does she ever feel stupid? He looks back over at her. She happens to look up and their eyes meet. She smiles. Horrified, he looks down.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He watches her again, thinks, then writes...</context>
      <utterance>Why don't I smile when she looks at me? I look away. Ashamed of myself.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He writes a few moments more, scribbling across the page, then stops and looks back over at the girl.</context>
      <utterance>Her figure makes me violent. I want to somehow break her. But tenderly. How is this possible? Ask Henry.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He tears out the page and folds it in half. Then he gets up and crosses the room to where the girl is busily engaged in her work. She looks up, sees him, and removes her headset with a pleasant smile. He places his note on the table before her, then turns and walks quickly away. The girl watches him go, confused, then lifts the note and reads...</context>
      <utterance>I can't breathe.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Why do I do this to myself? And why do I reduce you to only one possibility? These are not even questions anymore. I know the answers myself. This isn't a page of notes. It's a letter. A letter to you. A desperate act. You are a miracle to me. I can't breathe. By now, Simon is gone from the library. The girl finishes reading the letter and looks around in astonishment.</utterance>

      <utterance>I was caught. Yes, I was caught... once. I was caught in flagranti delicto screwing a thirteen-year-old girl named Susan. She was an ugly and mean-spirited kid, but she knew how to play upon my weaknesses which, I admit, are deep and many.</utterance>

      <context>He comes over and takes a beer. He strides around the room, thinking, reflecting.</context>
      <utterance>It was a pathetic little conspiracy. A transparently desperate attempt to discredit me and my ideas; to label me a mere pedophile. As if I'd be ashamed of such a thing. As if Socrates himself hadn't been taken out of circulation for corrupting the youth of Athens!</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Stops, drinks declares...</context>
      <utterance>Seven years. Seven years for one afternoon of blissful transgression. But what of it? Who cares? Prison's not so bad; particularly if one's a sex offender, free from the popular and conventional horror of sodomy.</utterance>

   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Drinks sloppily, burps, wipes his mouth with his arm.</context>
      <utterance>Nothing in comparison to the day my 'Confession' is unleashed.  What an orgy we'll have then, huh? What shouts of outrage from the offended populace, from the sanctimonious purveyors of culture and quality, the righteous defenders of what ever inane and haphazard notion of progress then in vogue. They'll be beside themselves with fiercely reasoned critical analysis. Apoplectic with indignation!</utterance>

      <context>He grabs a new beer and twists off its cap.</context>

      <utterance>Can you sit there, look me straight in the eye, and tell me you don't think this poem is great? That it is not at once a work of great lyrical beauty and ethical depth? That it is not a genuine, highly individual, and profound meditation on the miracle of existence?</utterance>

      <context>Simon just looks at him blankly, confused. The doors slide open and Angus gets in the elevator. He's gone. Simon sinks into a chair and stares at the carpet. He is so surprised and hurt he gasps for breath. His poem slips from his hand and falls to the floor.</context>
      <utterance>Never heard of him.</utterance>
   <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon doesn't register this right away. But then he looks up and over at the receptionist. Laura stands and comes around her desk. She pauses, seeing his disappointment, then comes closer and picks up his poem. Handing it to him, she explains...</context>

   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Henry sweats and moans as he empties his bowels in a violent and messy blast of noise and foul air. Fay covers her face and whimpers sickly. Finally, he's done. He hangs with his face out over his knees, sick, exhausted and in shock. Fay wraps herself in a towel and steps out of the shower. She creeps carefully around him and flushes the toilet, growing increasingly concerned.</context>
      <utterance>Jesus, Henry!</utterance>
   <speaker>FAY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>He is destroyed, staring down at... The 'ring' he still holds in his hand. Fay sees this, looks at Henry, then kneels and takes it from him. He doesn't resist. She lifts it up and breathlessly admires it. Totally misunderstanding, moved beyond words...</context>
      <utterance>Hey, Henry. You OK?</utterance>
   <speaker>FAY</speaker>

      <context>The doors of the church swing open with a tremendous creak and everyone turns from the altar to see... Amy enter. She steps in and stands there, alarmed, clutching a long scroll of fax paper.</context>

   <speaker>REPORTER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Fay leads the neighbors in the dance...</context>
      <utterance>It all started right here in Queens, Jim, at World of Donuts about one year ago today, when local garbage man, Simon Grim, put pencil to paper and began to compose what many have come to regard as vicious, antisocial and pornographic poetry -- 112 lines of unrhymed free meter verse which would one day serve to spark the flames of controversy across the nation and -- indeed -- the world.</utterance>
   <speaker>OWEN FEER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Henry and Fay dance, surrounded by the dancing neighbors...</context>
      <utterance>This is outrageous! Measures must be taken. Have we debased our culture to such an extent that a garbage man with a head full of sick ideas is legitimately referred to as a poet, and where the filth he spews can be accessed by any child old enough to turn on a computer? Is this what we have come to? Not the transmission of our highest ideals, but a cynical, atheistic delirium!</utterance>

      <utterance>I can soften up some of the language and make it read easier. Take out some of the more intratextual references and popularize the underlying Sturm und Drang, so to speak. I can change its mode. Make it more of a conventional novel instead.</utterance>

   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>

      <utterance>And insisted that there's no accounting for taste.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon's words catch in his throat. He turns away, frustrated.</context>

   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I don't know. I didn't bring it to Angus because I thought it was good. I brought it to Angus because you're my friend.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>Look, Henry, I did it! I wrote. I wrote poetry because you told me to! I worked! I worked while you sat back and comfortably dismissed the outside world as too shallow, stupid and mean to appreciate your ideas.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Is that such a priority? Is that some sort of measure of a man's worth? To drag what's best in him out into the street so every average slob with some pretense to taste can poke it with a stick?</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Henry just stares at him, stands, then turns on his heel and waves him off.</context>
      <utterance>Maybe. Maybe it is.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon hangs his head, destroyed.</context>
      <utterance>You must be pretty impressed with yourself, huh? The all too obviously talented new man, the important new voice, the early clue to a new direction, or whatever, etc., etc., etc! A popular new trend conveniently packaged for the distracted young herd! You want to be liked more than you know, Simon Grim! You'd be nowhere without me and you know it.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Henry is scared all of a sudden. But he puts on a defiant exterior.</context>
      <utterance>I'm leaving.</utterance>

   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>I saw you for what you were in the beginning, Simon. I hold no grudge and I'm certain you will, in time, leave some serious and small dent in this world.</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Henry take advantage of Simon's disillusionment and puts on a big show of secure wisdom.</context>
      <utterance>The world is full of shit.</utterance>
   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Simon sits there a moment, numb with grief. Henry, red in the face, stares at the floor. Suddenly, Simon stands and walks out. Henry looks up and watches him go. He can hardly believe it. He almost raises his voice and apologizes, but can't. He lowers his head again and covers his face with his hands, listening to Simon's footsteps receding through the halls. Simon walks on, away from us, down the hospital corridor.</context>
      <utterance>The world is full of shit. It's true. And you have to walk through it. That's your part. I'm sorry. But you're no good at it. Perhaps I'm not. Perhaps I wasn't made to walk through shit. Go on now. Leave. Do what you're good at. Go.</utterance>

Henry, semi-conscious and severely beaten, falls against the back door and coughs up a few of his teeth. Vicky steps into the hall from her room and shudders. Warren sits at the table, stunned.

      <context>Fay just looks at him blankly, overwhelmed, confused. She starts to cry quietly.</context>
      <utterance>Pearl claims she offered your husband sexual favors if he would kill her father.</utterance>
   <speaker>LAWYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Fay trembles and catches her breath trying to take this all in. A cop hands her some tissues. She takes them and tries to concentrate on what the lawyer says.</context>
      <utterance>I'm just repeating what she said, Mrs Fool. The victim's wife, Vicky, claims your husband broke into the house and forcefully entered her bedroom.</utterance>
   <speaker>LAWYER</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Fay, I know this isn't easy. But we need your help here. The girl claims she asked your husband to kill her father in exchange for, well, I guess the promise of sexual relations with her.</utterance>

   <speaker>HENRY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Ned nods and Henry pats him on the shoulder. Then he stands before Fay and looks at his feet. With her arms folded across her chest and her hip cocked, she taps her foot impatiently and waits for his last line of crap.</context>

      <context>But then she looks at him and softens. He leans in and kisses her passionately on the mouth. Moments later, they all help Henry into Buuel's car and Simon gets in behind the wheel.

   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>

      <context>Henry is ushered through security. They take his ticket and check his passport again. They take his suitcase and place it on the conveyor belt. He passes through the metal detector. They pass the metal detector wand over him and he stands there with his hands outstretched, as... Simon waits and watches. The suitcase rolls out from the x-ray machine and as Henry grabs it, he stops and looks across the security checkpoint at... Simon, standing there. He steps forward anxiously. Henry lingers, speechless, but the airline representatives are at his side...</context>

      <mode></mode>
      <context>Runway technicians rush to their positions, but Henry hangs back and struggles across the tarmac, looking back over his shoulder at... Simon, behind the huge plate glass window of the terminal. He stops and waits. Simon raises his hand in farewell and... Henry raises his in reply. Then Simon, unheard behind the gigantic glass wall, silent amongst the roar of the runway, says...</context>
      <utterance>This way, Mr Grim! This way!</utterance>
   <speaker>SIMON</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>And Henry understands. He lowers his hand, waits just a moment, then turns and looks out at... The airplane. The airline representative is shouting at him from the foot of the stairs and waving him on with her walkie- talkie. He glances back once more at Simon. Then... Henry is running, struggling towards us, forcing himself towards the plane, getting stronger and running faster with every step he takes.</context>
