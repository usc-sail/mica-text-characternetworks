      <context>BERTIE'S POV - Speaker's Corner with its assortment of orators, prophets, protestors, and onlookers gathered around soapboxs, agreeing, disagreeing, shouting comments. Others carry placards, sing protest songs. A miners' strike is the focus of the day. A large, rather untidy workingman with a florid rosacea nose spots the passing Austin and stares at the occupants. REVERSE ANGLE - Bertie's face stares back. The first drops splatter against the glass. Elizabeth sighs.</context>

      <context>Bertie moves forward diffidently, without an ounce of confidence, knowing deep within he's doomed. His stomach knots, chest muscles contract, constricting his breath.</context>

   <speaker>BERTIE</speaker>

      <context>It is a shock to realize this is a man with a profound stutter. A man who cannot speak in public. Lang whispers to Churchill. When Lang whispers, everyone can hear.</context>

      <context>During this, Bertie's hands begin to shake, the pages of his speech rattle like dry leaves, his throat muscles constrict, the Adam's apple bulges, his lips tighten...all the old symptoms reappear. Several seconds have elapsed since the Reader finished. It seems an eternity. Elizabeth grasps the sides of her chair with white knuckles. Lang's eyes roll heavenward. Churchill studies the situation, ready to leap into the breach. Bertie and Logue stare at each other. Logue smiles, perfectly calm, totally confident in the man he's worked with. His confidence is contagious. Bertie takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. His hands grow steady, his throat muscles relax...all the things he's practiced. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 112.</context>
      <utterance>Good evening, this is the BBC National and World programme, broadcasting from Buckingham Palace. His Majesty, the King.</utterance>

      <utterance>...this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself. For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war. For we are called, with our allies, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world. It is the principle which permits a State, in the selfish pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the use of force, or threat of force, against the sovereignty and independence of other States. Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right, and if this principle were established throughout the world, the freedom of our own country and of the whole British Commonwealth of Nations would be in danger.</utterance>

      <context>End the montage with a return to the exterior of Buckingham Palace. Outside, stand solemn crowds, listening to the speech on loudspeakers. PAN THEIR FACES, the faces of England, stalwart and resolved.</context>
      <utterance>But far more than this - the peoples of the world would be kept in the bondage of fear, and all hopes of settled peace and of the security of justice and liberty among nations would be ended. This is the ultimate issue which confronts us.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, and of the world's order and peace, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge. It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own. I ask them to stand calm, firm, and united in this time of trial. The task will be hard. There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield. But we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit our cause to God.</utterance>

      <utterance>We may all find a message of encouragement in the lines which, in my closing words, I would like to say to you: `I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year, "Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown."
