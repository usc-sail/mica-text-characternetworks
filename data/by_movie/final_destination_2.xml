      <context>Thomas, out of uniform, takes a bite of his own. As the metal skewer is deep in his mouth -- A running FRISBEE PLAYER accidentally bumps into Thomas! But no harm. Thomas gives the guy a friendly pat and goes back to rewrapping his mouth around the shish-kabob.</context>
      <utterance>My God, this is delicious. I can't believe I used to be a vegan.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. BURROUGHS</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>Kimberly turns red as Mr. Burroughs appears and takes a seat.</context>
      <utterance>So what's the deal, Thomas? Three months and you still haven't asked my daughter out on a date.</utterance>
   <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>

      <utterance>What's wrong with a platonic relationship?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. GIBBONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Platonic my ass. That's for ugly women.</utterance>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.</utterance>
   <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. GIBBONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Oh please. I'm not hurting anyone.  Besides, if you can beat Death,</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. GIBBONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mr. Gibbons sits down at the table with two plates of food. His wife, MRS. GIBBONS, joins.</context>
      <utterance>what's he got to worry about me for?</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. GIBBONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>It seems by now everyone's familiar with the concept.</context>
      <utterance>You know, you still never explained to us how you did it.</utterance>
   <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Mrs. Gibbons makes a face, finding the discourse distasteful. She changes the conversation.</context>
      <utterance>Well, technically when we died, we gave Death what it wanted. And by the time we were revived, it had already moved on to graver pastures.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. GIBBONS</speaker>

      <context></context>
      <utterance>You know, I'm having the greatest day?</utterance>
   <speaker>KIMBERLY</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>Big props to you and Brian.</context>
      <utterance>Food's great too, Mrs. Gibbons.</utterance>

      <utterance>Our...pleasure. So, ready for the back-to -school season? NYU, right?</utterance>

      <utterance>Three short glorious weeks away.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. GIBBONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context></context>
      <utterance>Sounds wonderful. I wish I were going myself.</utterance>
   <speaker>MR. GIBBONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>A chorus of friendly laughter.</context>
      <utterance>You may want to think twice about letting her live in the village, Bob. Our eldest daughter moved there and came back with piercings all over her face.  Among other places.</utterance>
   <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
      <mode>O.S.</mode>
      <context>BRIAN enters frame, soaking up fresh laughter. He holds a plate full of raw chicken fillets and some long, wooden matches.</context>
      <utterance>Dad used to call her the pincushion. From Hellraiser.</utterance>

      <context>Mr. Gibbons hands it over and Brian saunters away from camera, SLIGHTLY OUT OF FOCUS, toward the barbecue, his body framed between Kimberly and Thomas' heads.</context>
      <utterance>Sure, here.</utterance>

      <utterance>Sure does. Owes it to that friend of yours, in a way.</utterance>

      <utterance>Well, Brian was nearly hit by an ambulance the day...but your friend Rory pulled him back at the last second.</utterance>
   <speaker>MRS. GIBBONS</speaker>
      <mode></mode>
      <context>BOOM!!! The PROPANE TANK blows Brian to smithereens. A deafening silence follows, punctuated when Brian's ARM lands on Mrs. Gibbons' plate. PLOP.</context>
      <utterance>You never told me that, Peter. Boy, that was lucky.</utterance>
