RECORD PLAYER => In order to show you how a big symphony orchestra is put together, Benjamin Britten has written a big piece of music, which is made up of smaller pieces that show you all the separate parts of the orchestra.
NARRATOR => This is the island of New Penzance. Sixteen miles long. Forested with old- growth pine and maple. Criss-crossed by shallow tidal creeks. An important seabird habitat. There are no paved roads but instead many miles of intersecting foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry that runs twice daily from Stone Cove. The year is 1965. We are on the far edge of Black Beacon Sound, famous for the ferocious and well-documented storm which will strike from the east on the fifth of September -- in three day's time.
GADGE => Morning, sir.
ROOSEVELT =>  I don't know. I think I skipped a stitch.
SKOTAK =>  We're building a tree house.
SKOTAK => Well, where would you've built it?
PANAGLE => Sixteen and a half.
REDFORD => Safety-test, sir.
REDFORD => The vehicle appears to be in good working order. I'm just checking if --
CAPTAIN SHARP => Watch my line, Edgar.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Hello? This is Captain Sharp. Over.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Morning, Randy. What can I do for you? Over.
CAPTAIN SHARP => What does that mean? Over.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Any idea why? Over.
CAPTAIN SHARP => I guess we better notify his folks. Over.
BECKY => Hello, Diane.
OPERATOR => Becky, I have your person-to-person from Chesterfield.
BECKY => Hold the line, please.
BECKY => Go ahead, Chesterfield.
MR. BILLINGSLEY => Hello?
CAPTAIN SHARP => Hello, sir. This is Captain Sharp.
MR. BILLINGSLEY => Yes, sir. I received your message. Thank you very much. In fact, we've come to a decision, as a family, because this is only the most recent incident involving Sam's troubles, and it's just not fair to the others, so, unfortunately -- we can't invite him back, at this time.
CAPTAIN SHARP => There's no cause for alarm, sir. We'll find him. We're just notifying you as a matter of protocol and so on.
MR. BILLINGSLEY => I understand that. I'm notifying you of the situation on my end.
CAPTAIN SHARP => I'm confused by that statement. You can't invite him back?
MR. BILLINGSLEY => I'm afraid not. He's a good boy, he's got a good heart, but it's just not fair to the others, you see? He's emotionally disturbed.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Am I speaking to Sam's father?
MR. BILLINGSLEY => No, sir. Sam's parents passed away a number of years ago. We're Mr. and Mrs. Billingsley. We're foster parents. Sam's been with us since last June.
MR. BILLINGSLEY => Well, it's a known fact. Of course, he is.
MR. BILLINGSLEY => I don't know. What register?
MR. BILLINGSLEY => We sent him a letter. It should reach you presently.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Mr. Billingsley, I've got an escaped Khaki Scout. We're notifying you as a matter of protocol. You say you can't invite him back? You say he's an orphan? Well, I don't understand how that works.  What am I supposed to do with him?
MR. BILLINGSLEY => That's up to Social Services. They'll be in touch with you. They'll look after Sam. Good luck to you.
LAZY-EYE => What's your real job, sir?
LAZY-EYE => What grade?
REDFORD => What if he resists?
REDFORD => Shakusky. Are we allowed to use force on him?
SKOTAK => Right here.
LAZY-EYE => I heard he ran away because his family died.
GADGE => I heard he never had any family in the first place.
DELUCA => That's probably why he's crazy.
REDFORD => I'll tell you one thing: if we find him, I'm not going to be the one who forgot to bring a weapon.
NICKLEBY => Me, neither.
MR. BISHOP => Camp Ivanhoe? That's all the way across the other side of the island. You really think a twelve-year-old boy could row this far in a canoe?
CAPTAIN SHARP => Most likely not.
MRS. BISHOP =>  It's possible, Counsellor.
MR. BISHOP =>  I disagree, Counsellor. It'd take him three days, at least.
MRS. BISHOP => I don't think so. Two days, maximum.
MR. BISHOP => Well, I'm not going to argue about it.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Be that as it may, will you let me know if you see anything unusual?
BENJAMIN BRITTEN'S => "NOYE'S FLUDDE" Performed by the Choristers of St. Jack Wood and New Penzance
SAM => What kind of bird are you?
BOSSY GIRL => I'm a sparrow, she's a dove, and --
SAM => No, I said, "What kind of bird are you?"
SUZY => I'm a raven.
BOSSY GIRL => Boy's aren't allowed in here.
SAM => I'll be leaving soon.
SAM => What happened to your hand?
SUZY =>  I got hit in the mirror.
SAM =>  Really. How'd that happen?
SUZY =>  I lost my temper at myself.
SUZY => What's your name?
SAM => Sam. What's yours?
SUZY => I'm Suzy.
BOSSY GIRL => It's not polite to stare.
MRS. LYNN => Birds! Ready?
MRS. LYNN => Who are you? Where'd you come from? Go back to your seat.
SKINNY GIRL => He likes you.
SAM => Were you followed?
SUZY =>  I doubt it.
SAM => Good.
SAM => Did you bring a cat?
SAM => Can you read a map?
SUZY => Uh-huh.
SAM => I do cartography.
SAM => I feel we should go halfway today and halfway tomorrow, since you're a less experienced hiker, and you're wearing Sunday-school shoes.
SUZY => OK.
SAM =>  Here's where we are right now. I'd like to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred . How does that sound?
SUZY => Fine.
SAM => You want some beef jerky?
SUZY => OK.
SAM => Let's go.
SAM => Are you thirsty?
SUZY => No.
SAM => Well, if your throat gets parched, stick a pebble in your mouth and suck on it. You can quench your thirst with the spit, supposedly.
SAM => Sometimes I stick leaves under my hat. It cools your head down.
SUZY => That's a good idea. It might help also if you didn't wear fur.
SAM =>  True, but this adds camouflage.
SAM => Here's a trick. Throw grass in the air, and you can see which direction the wind's blowing.
SUZY => Which way?
SAM => Unknown. I guess it doesn't really matter, as long as we cover our tracks.
SAM => These might be poisonous.
SUZY =>  No, they're huckleberries, in fact. Try one.
SAM => Not bad. Anyway, they're good for survival.
SUZY => He knows someone's watching him.
SAM => I agree. Why do you say that?
SUZY =>  I don't know. I just think he can feel us.
SAM => You smell like perfume.
SUZY => It's my mother's.
SAM => I brought water, too.
SAM => Should we catch him?
SUZY =>  What for?
SAM => Trout bait. We need worms.
SUZY =>  No.
SAM => You're right. We'll let him live. Maybe I've got a licorice whip.
SAM => How strong of a swimmer are you?
SUZY => Pretty good. I broke our school record for the back-stroke.
SAM =>  OK. Well, I'm not that strong of a swimmer, so I wear a life-preserver. I think it's a good policy to get in the habit, anyway.
SUZY => OK.
SAM => Watch out for turtles. They'll bite you, if you put your fingers in their mouths. Let me see if I can catch this one.
SAM => Somebody wrote on him.
SUZY => The stick's moving!
SAM =>  You got one!
SAM => Fish on hook!  Reel him in! Slowly.
SUZY => Sit down!
SAM => You're doing good.
SAM => This is for fishing.
SUZY => Very good. You know a lot about camping, don't you?
SAM =>  I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained for.
SAM => Anyway, I used to be.
SAM => We can feed your cat the guts and eyeballs.
SUZY => That's OK. He only eats cat food.
SAM => What else did you bring? We should make an inventory.
SUZY => OK.
SAM => Go ahead.
SUZY => This is my record player. It works with batteries. Actually, it belongs to my little brother Lionel. I left him a note. Do you like music?
SUZY => This is my favorite record album. My godmother gave it to me for my birthday. She lives in France.
SUZY => These are my books. I like stories with magic powers in them. Either in kingdoms on earth or on foreign planets. Also, time-travel, if they make it realistic. Usually, I prefer a girl hero, but not always. I couldn't bring all of them because it got too heavy. You can borrow any you want.
SUZY => I also brought my lefty scissors because I'm left-handed, my toothbrush, some rubber bands, extra batteries, and my binoculars, as you know. I forgot my comb.
SAM => That's it? No mess-kit? No flashlight? No canteen? No waterproof matches? Didn't you get the packing list I sent you in my last letter?
SUZY =>  I thought that's what you're supposed to bring. I don't own a canteen.
SAM => That's OK. We can share.
SAM => These are all library books. In my school you're only allowed to check-out one at a time. Some of these are going to be overdue.
SAM => Do you steal?
SAM => Why? You're not poor.
SUZY => I might turn some of them back in one day. I haven't decided yet. I know it's bad. I think I just took them to have a secret to keep. Anyway, for some reason, it makes me feel in a better mood sometimes.
SAM => Are you depressed?
SAM => How come?
SUZY => Well, I can show you an example, if you want -- but it doesn't make me feel very good. I found this on top of our refrigerator.
SAM => Does that mean you?
SUZY => It's not funny.
SAM => To me, it is.
SUZY => You really know how to make friends.
SAM => I'm sorry.
SUZY => That's OK.
SAM => I'm on your side.
SUZY => I know.
SAM => Which one's the best?
SUZY => His eyes downcast, his kingdom in ruins, Mynar pressed his heavy paw through the rippling surface of the cool shallows and down to its stone floor. "My people once were lead by a great and noble beast -- and I no longer see his face in this reflection."
SUZY => Meanwhile, on the Plains of Tabitha, Francine rested. There would be another time for war.
MRS. BISHOP => Suzy! Dinner! I'm not going to say it again!
MRS. BISHOP => Where's your sister?
LIONEL => I don't know, but she borrowed my record player for ten days without asking.
MRS. BISHOP =>  What does that mean?
MRS. BISHOP => Walt! Where the hell are you?
MR. BISHOP => Right here! Why are you cursing at me?
MRS. BISHOP => Does it concern you that your daughter's just run away from home?
MR. BISHOP =>  That's a loaded question.
MRS. BISHOP => Come down and read this.
BECKY => Scout Master Ward confirms they've had no luck. They're going home for the --
MR. BISHOP => Who's there?
CAPTAIN SHARP => Good evening. Sorry to startle you. I was JUST --
MR. BISHOP =>  What are you doing here? Nobody called the police.
CAPTAIN SHARP => I know, that's what I'm saying. The search party's not over yet. In other WORDS --
MRS. BISHOP => Suzy's missing, too! Go find her.
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  OK. Where'd she --
MR. BISHOP => Wait for me.
MR. BISHOP => How can we help her? She's got so many problems. It's getting worse.
MR. BISHOP => Whose fault is it?
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  I don't know, but just for the record: ninety-five percent of all runaways return home within six hours. That doesn't do you any good right now. It's just a statistic -- but in all likelihood Suzy's probably hiding in the closet at her best friend's house playing Chinese Checkers at this very moment, as we speak.
MR. BISHOP => She doesn't have any friends.
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  How's Laura?
MR. BISHOP =>  How's Laura?
CAPTAIN SHARP => Mrs. Bishop, I mean.
MR. BISHOP => I don't understand.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Is she upset?
CAPTAIN SHARP => I got to get this spot-light fixed.
MRS. BISHOP => She has a pen pal! It's very intimate! They planned this together!
CAPTAIN SHARP => Sam Shakusky. That's my escaped Khaki Scout. His family died.
MR. BISHOP => Holy Christ. What am I looking at?
MRS. BISHOP => He does watercolors! Mostly landscapes, but a few nudes!
MR. BISHOP => She sit for this?
CAPTAIN SHARP => What does he say?
SAM => Dear Suzy, You have a superb voice. You were my favorite animal in the program, by far. Please, find enclosed --
SUZY => Dear Sam, Thank you very much. I got replaced as the raven because I yelled at Mrs. Lynn. After that I was only a blue jay, but --
SAM => Dear Suzy, I am sorry your brothers are so selfish. Maybe they will grow out of it. Sometimes people do things without knowing the reasons for --
SUZY => Dear Sam, You are an excellent painter, especially trees and telephone poles. Is the girl in the water supposed to be me? My favorite color is --
SAM => Dear Suzy, I accidentally built a fire while I was sleep-walking. I have no memory of this, but my foster parents think I am lying. Unfortunately, it is --
SUZY => Dear Sam, I am in trouble again because I threw a rock through the window. My mother still has glass in her hair. Also --
SAM => Dear Suzy, I have been trying very hard to make friends, but I feel people do not like my personality. In fact, I can understand why they might --
SUZY => Dear Sam, Now I am getting suspended because I got in a fight with Molly. She says I go berserk. Our principal is against me. Why do --
SAM => Dear Suzy, I know your parents hurt your feelings, but they still love you. That is more important. If they --
SUZY => Dear Sam, I do think you should think of their faces every day, even if it makes you sad. It is too bad they did not leave you more pictures of themselves. Can you --
SAM => Dear Suzy, Here is my plan.
SUZY => Dear Sam, My answer is yes.
SAM => Dear Suzy, When?
SUZY => Dear Sam, Where?
SAM => Dear Suzy, Walk four hundred yards due north from your house to the dirt path which has not got any name on it. Turn right and follow to the end.
SAM => I will meet you in the meadow.
BECKY => I'm not sure. I think he went searching in the dark.
MR. BISHOP => She stole the batteries out of my flashlight.
CAPTAIN SHARP => I think he's onto us.
MRS. BISHOP =>  Of course, he is.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Of course, he is?
MRS. BISHOP => Of course, he is.
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  Why aren't we worried about that, then?
MRS. BISHOP => I am.
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  Well, I didn't know. Or, anyway, I thought I was wrong. Did you hit him?
MRS. BISHOP => No. He fell in a ditch.
NICKLEBY => Cat food! I think it's a clue.
MR. BISHOP => That's her.
MRS. BISHOP => I don't know.
CAPTAIN SHARP => All right. We know they're together. We know they're within a certain radius of this spot. I'm declaring the case with the county right now. Until help arrives:
CAPTAIN SHARP => I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny one, and the kid with the curly hair to come with me in the station wagon. Randy, you drop-in and head up-river with the rest of your troop, then split-up on foot. Becky, call Jed and tell him to circle over this end of the island and fly low.
SUZY => They found the canoe.
SAM =>  Rats! I should've put more pine needles on it. Let's go. We're almost there.
SAM => What do you creeps want?
REDFORD => We're looking for you.
SAM => Why?
REDFORD => Because you're a fugitive.
SAM => No, I'm not. Didn't you get my letter of resignation? I quit the Khaki Scouts.
REDFORD => You're still in uniform.
REDFORD => Well, it doesn't matter, anyway. You don't have that authority. We've been deputized. Now are you going to come along peacefully or not?
SAM => Listen to some reason: I don't like you. You don't like me. Why don't you stupid idiots just let us disappear?
REDFORD =>  It's tempting, but I can't allow it.
DELUCA => You shouldn't be friends with him.
SUZY =>  Why not?
DELUCA => Because he's crazy.
SUZY =>  Maybe you just don't know him.
REDFORD => We know him a lot better than you. He's emotionally disturbed because his family died. Nickleby, tie him up.
SAM => Do not cross this stick.
REDFORD => You're doomed, Shakusky.
SAM => It was him or us.
SUZY => Oh, no.
SAM => They got Snoopy through the neck.
SUZY => He needs a doctor.
SAM => No, he doesn't. He needs a morgue.
SUZY =>  He's losing blood. Hurry. Where do we go?
SAM => Suzy. Look at me. Snoopy's not going to make it.
SUZY =>  Don't say that.
SAM => They're after us. We got to move.
SUZY =>  He's dying! We can't just leave him!
SAM =>  It's too late! He's already gone!
SUZY =>  Stop yelling at me!
SAM => I'm sorry I had to do that, but you're panicking. The first rule in any emergency is you never --
SUZY => Don't ever do that again. No one's allowed to slap me.
SUZY => You're right. He's dead.
SUZY => Was he a good dog?
SAM => Who's to say -- but he didn't deserve to die.
LAZY-EYE => She stabbed Redford in the back with lefty scissors!
JED => Repeat that, please? Over.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Puncture wound. Lower lumbar. Make room for a stretcher in the cockpit!
NICKLEBY => I tried to chop him, but he dodged my tomahawk.
PANAGLE => Who else got hit?
IZOD => Not me. I ran away when the girl went berserk.
SKOTAK => He's got great marksmanship. He shot Deluca in both arms.
GADGE => Where's Snoopy?
MR. BISHOP => What happened? Who's that? Why's he bleeding?
CAPTAIN SHARP => Clear the dock, Edgar!
MRS. BISHOP => Is Suzy with you?
GADGE => No, she's in the woods with Shakusky.
JED => Where'm I going?
CAPTAIN SHARP => The infirmary at Fort Lebanon. We'll be right behind you.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Warm up the motor. I'll be right back.
MR. BISHOP => Hold it right there. You're not leaving this island. Our daughter's been abducted by one these beige lunatics.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Walt, it's very clear: the two of them conspired in this together.
MR. BISHOP => Why can't you control your scouts?
CAPTAIN SHARP => Stop.
MRS. BISHOP => Stop it, Walt!
CAPTAIN SHARP => I do blame him --  -- but I also blame myself and both of you. With all due respect: you can't let your children stab people.
MRS. BISHOP =>  What are you talking about?
MRS. BISHOP => I don't get it. Were there witnesses?
MRS. BISHOP => I beg your pardon. Are you a lawyer?
MRS. BISHOP =>  Well, I am!
CAPTAIN SHARP => Easy does it. Calm down, Laura.
MR. BISHOP => Stay away from my wife.
NARRATOR => Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me, Captain Sharp?
NARRATOR => As some of you know, I taught Sam for the cartography Accomplishment Patch. He's a smart boy, and he expressed a keen interest in the history of the island's indigenous peoples. In particular, I recall his fascination with the idea of retracing the original path of the old Chickchaw harvest migration.
NARRATOR => What I'm getting at is this: I think I know where they're going.
RECORD PLAYER => Onto the bird-house, where every kind of bird imaginable is whirling and wheeling around. This is a real acrobatic act for our gifted young flute player, Paula Robeson.
SUZY => This is weird.
SAM => I know!
SAM => On three!
SUZY => I like it here, but I don't like the name.
SAM => Me, neither.
SUZY => Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. It's got no ring to it.
SAM => Let's change it. What should it be?
SUZY => Let me think for a minute.
SAM => I made you some jewelry.
SAM => Are your ears pierced?
SUZY => It's pretty. Do the other one.
SUZY => It feels hard.
SAM =>  Do you mind?
SUZY => I like it.
SAM =>  Tilt your head sideways.
SUZY => You can touch my chest.
SUZY => They're going to grow more.
SAM => Why do you always use binoculars?
SUZY => It helps me see things closer. Even if they're not very far away. I pretend it's my magic power.
SAM =>  That sounds like poetry. Poems don't always have to rhyme, you know. They're just supposed to be creative.
SAM => What do you want to be? When you grow up.
SUZY => I don't know. I want to go on adventures, I think. Not get stuck in one place. How about you?
SAM =>  Go on adventures, too. Not get stuck, too. I guess that sounds almost like I'm just repeating what you just said, but I couldn't think of anything as good as it. On the other hand, maybe we'll get blown up by an atom bomb. You can't predict the exact future.
SUZY => That's true.
SAM => It's possible I may wet the bed, by the way. Later, I mean.
SUZY =>  OK.
SAM =>  I wish I didn't have to mention it, but just in case. I don't want to make you be offended.
SUZY =>  Of course, I won't.
SAM => Some people frown on these problems.
SUZY => What's that one for?
SAM => It's not an accomplishment. I inherited it from my mother. It's actually not meant for a male to wear -- but I don't give a damn.
SUZY => Are your foster parents still mad at you? For getting in trouble so much.
SAM => I don't think so. We're getting to know each other better. I feel like I'm in a family now. Not like yours, but similar to one.
SUZY => I always wished I was an orphan. Most of my favorite characters are. I think your lives are more special.
SAM => I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about.
SUZY => I love you, too.
SUZY => The flashlight's beam drew a moon through the black across the attic and settled on a gap in the base-board. A mouse-hole, no bigger than a pocket-watch. Eric crouched on his flat feet and placed his hand in front of the tiny opening. "It's windy," he said. "Like someone in there's blowing on my fingers." Christy rolled her eyes and sighed a sigh. He's right again, she thought. Little brothers drive people crazy.
SUZY => Part Two.
MR. BISHOP => Suzy! Get out here!
MRS. BISHOP => Put your clothes on. Both of you.
SKOTAK => How long were you planning to stay there?
SAM => I don't know.
MURRAY => You said ten days or less.
SUZY => That was a lie.
GADGE => Didn't you ever think about what would happen next?
SAM => Not to my recollection.
LIONEL => You're a traitor to our family.
SUZY => Good. I want to be.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Give him his mail.
SUZY => What does it say?
SAM =>  They can't invite me back.
SUZY =>  Why not?
SAM =>  I gave them too much aggravation.
SUZY => Let me read it.
SUZY => That's child abuse.
MR. BISHOP => Be advised: the two of you will never see each other again. Those were your last words. Do you understand?
SUZY =>  I'd be careful if I were you. One of these days somebody's going to be pushed too far, and who knows what they're capable of.
MR. BISHOP =>  Is that a threat?
SUZY =>  It's a warning.
SUZY => I wish I knew what makes you tick.
MR. BISHOP =>  I beg your pardon?
MRS. BISHOP => Please, terminate this conversation.
MR. BISHOP =>  She's saying that to me?
OPERATOR => Hello, Becky.
BECKY => Judy, I have your person-to-person from New Penzance.
OPERATOR => Go ahead, New Penzance.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Hello? This is Captain Sharp.
SOCIAL SERVICES => Hello, Captain Sharp. This is Social Services. I'm calling in reference to Sam Shakusky, Ward of the State. I understand he's in your custody.
CAPTAIN SHARP => That's correct.
SOCIAL SERVICES => What's his condition? Has he suffered any injury or trauma of any kind?
CAPTAIN SHARP => He's OK.
SOCIAL SERVICES => Very good. How do I get to you?
CAPTAIN SHARP => The fastest way is by seaplane. Jed can bring you in with the mail.
SOCIAL SERVICES => I'll come tomorrow morning, if that's acceptable to you. Is someone able to 
SOCIAL SERVICES => provide reasonable care and nourishment for the boy until that time?
CAPTAIN SHARP => Uh-huh.
SOCIAL SERVICES => Is that a yes?
CAPTAIN SHARP => Uh-huh.
SOCIAL SERVICES => Very good. I'll contact you again before the end of the day.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Wait a second.
SOCIAL SERVICES =>  Yes?
CAPTAIN SHARP => Social Services?
SOCIAL SERVICES =>  Captain Sharp.
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  What's going to happen to him?
SOCIAL SERVICES => Well, normally, we'd try to place him in another foster home, but that option is no longer available to us, in my opinion, with his case history -- which means he'll go to Juvenile Refuge.
SOCIAL SERVICES => Who's speaking?
SOCIAL SERVICES => Right. An orphanage -- but the first step is the admissions panel requires a psychological evaluation to determine whether or not the boy's a candidate for institutional treatment or electroshock therapy. Beyond that --
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  Excuse me. Shock therapy? Why would that be necessary? He's not violent.
SOCIAL SERVICES => The report describes an assault with scissors.
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  That was the girl! Who did that.
SOCIAL SERVICES =>  Well, maybe she needs help, too -- but that's not our job. OK?
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  OK.
MR. BISHOP => I'll be out back.
MR. BISHOP => I'm going to find a tree to chop down.
MRS. BISHOP => I do know what you're feeling, Suzy-bean. I've had moments myself where I say: what am I doing here? Who made this decision? How could I allow myself to do something so stupid --  -- and why is it still happening? We women are more emotional. You have to REMEMBER --
SUZY => I hate you.
MRS. BISHOP =>  Don't say "hate".
SUZY => Why not? I mean it.
MRS. BISHOP => You think you mean it. In this moment. You're trying to hurt me.
SUZY => Exactly.  I know what you do with that sad, dumb police man. You go to bed with him.
MRS. BISHOP => He's not dumb, but I guess he is kind of sad. Anyway, we shouldn't discuss that. It's not appropriate for me to even acknowledge what I already just said.
MRS. BISHOP => Poor Suzy. Why is everything so hard for you?
SUZY => We're in love. We just want to be together. What's wrong with that?
MRS. BISHOP => Oh, my God. How are we going to get these fish-hooks out?
SAM => I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That part's true. We knew people would be worried, and we still ran away, anyway -- but something also happened which we didn't do on purpose. When we first met each other. Something happened to us.
CAPTAIN SHARP => I agree with you. That's eloquent. I can't argue against anything you're saying -- but I don't have to, because you're twelve years old.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Look, let's face it, you're probably a much more intelligent person than I am. In fact, I guarantee it -- but even smart kids sometimes stick their fingers in electrical sockets, if you see what I mean. It takes time to figure things out. It's been proven by history: all mankind makes mistakes. It's our job to try to protect you from the dangerous ones. If we can.
CAPTAIN SHARP => You want a slug?
CAPTAIN SHARP => What's the rush? You've got your whole life in front of yourself. Ahead of you, I mean.
SAM =>  Maybe so. Anyway, you're a bachelor.
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  What does that have to do with it? So are you.
SAM =>  That's true. Did you love someone ever?
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  Yes, I did.
SAM => What happened?
CAPTAIN SHARP => She didn't love me back.
SAM => Ah.
CAPTAIN SHARP => I'm sorry for your loss. Anyway, that's what people say.
SAM => Thanks.
CAPTAIN SHARP => What happened?
SAM => A drunk truck driver smashed into them.
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  Good grief.
GADGE => I heard he's going to reform school.
DELUCA => I heard they're going to take out a piece of his brain and send him to an insane asylum.
ROOSEVELT => I like his girl.
PANAGLE => She's too scruffy for me.
NICKLEBY => Supposedly, they got to third base.
LAZY-EYE => That's not true. He just felt her up.
ROOSEVELT =>  Over-shirt or under-shirt?
SKOTAK => Damn us.
SKOTAK => This troop has been very shabby to Field Mate Sam Shakusky. In fact, we've been a bunch of mean jerks. Why's he so unpopular? I admit, supposedly, he's 
SKOTAK => emotionally disturbed -- but he's also a disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel?
SKOTAK => Nickleby? Deluca? Lazy-Eye?  Gadge?
SKOTAK => He's a fellow Khaki Scout, and he needs our help. Are we man enough to give that? So part of his brain doesn't get removed out of him.
SKOTAK => They were prepared to die for each other out there.
DELUCA => What do you need?
SKOTAK =>  For starters? Three yards of chicken wire, some ripped-up newspapers, and a bucket of wheatpaste.
CAPTAIN SHARP => In other words, it's over.
MRS. BISHOP => I guess so. For the moment.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Until further notice.
MRS. BISHOP => That's right.
CAPTAIN SHARP => I understand.
MRS. BISHOP => I've got to do better. For everybody.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Except me.
MRS. BISHOP => Except you.
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  Well, I hope you can. I think you will. You're doing the right thing.
MRS. BISHOP => Who know what's going to happen, Duffy? I'll probably see you tomorrow.
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  No, you won't.
CAPTAIN SHARP => I admire them, you know? There's a purity to it. I only feel bad because they both seem like such unhappy, lonely, miserable people -- but maybe that's romantic.
MRS. BISHOP =>  I don't see it that way.
SAM => Get out of my chimney.
SKOTAK => Listen to me. We're here for friendship. We're going to get you off this island.
SAM =>  No, thanks.
SKOTAK => Yes, thanks. This is an emergency rescue.
SAM => It's worthless to me. There's no point. Not without Suzy.
SAM => How'd you get here?
SUZY => They snuck me down the laundry chute and left a paper-mach dummy in my bed.
SAM =>  Diversion tactics. Good thinking.
SAM => Where we going?
SKOTAK => Fort Lebanon. My cousin Ben runs the Supply and Resources outpost for the Jubilee. He's a Falcon Scout, Legionnaire. Cousin Ben'll know what to do.
SAM => Can we trust him?
SKOTAK => Normally, I'd say no.
SAM => Did you leave another note for Lionel?
SUZY => Not this time. He can't keep his trap shut. Besides, I'll probably never see him again.
SAM => That's true.
NARRATOR => This is the island of St. Jack Wood, extending far north from Land's End along the deep-water channel that leads to Broken Rock. A low flood-plain separates the beach from the town-ship above. A small but prosperous community.
NARRATOR => The barometer reads twenty-seven inches and dropping. Strong winds, as you can see, already at twenty-two knots.  The time is now four thirty-five A.M.
MRS. BISHOP => Did you file the motion for continuance? Peabody vs. Henderson.
MR. BISHOP => It was sustained.
MRS. BISHOP => Good.
MR. BISHOP =>  Did the judge consider your application for leniency? Rogers vs. Yentob.
MRS. BISHOP => He granted it.
MR. BISHOP => Great.
MRS. BISHOP => I'm sorry, Walt.
MR. BISHOP => It's not your fault. Which injuries are you apologizing for? Specifically.
MRS. BISHOP => Specifically? Whichever ones still hurt.
MR. BISHOP =>  Half of those were self-inflicted.
MR. BISHOP => I hope the roof flies off, and I get sucked up into space. You'll be better off without me.
MRS. BISHOP =>  Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
MR. BISHOP =>  Why?
MRS. BISHOP => We're all they've got, Walt.
MR. BISHOP => It's not enough.
SUZY => "-- but I'm not going," said Barnaby Jack. "I'm running away tonight for good, and this time I won't get caught." Annabelle whispered: "I'm coming with you." Her yellow hair, now brown at the roots, caught up in the wind and danced. Barnaby Jack took Annabelle's hand and pressed something into it the size of a jellybean. "Hide this in your socks, and be ready at midnight."
SUZY => He leapt out the window and landed in the fresh-fallen snow.
SECRETARY MCINTIRE => You're not going to believe this one, sir. That Scout Master on New Penzance? Has now lost his entire troop.
COMMANDER PIERCE => Well, I'll be damned. Who is this bimbo?
SECRETARY MCINTIRE =>  I couldn't say.
GUARD SCOUT => Who's your unit leader?
NICKLEBY => That guy.
SKOTAK => There's a broken gum-ball machine behind the snack tent.
COUSIN BEN => I don't care how they do it where you come from. You want pop? You want candy? You want a snake-bite kit? Get some money.
COUSIN BEN => Come back in five minutes.
COUSIN BEN => Is this him?
SAM => Field Mate Sam Shakusky, Troop 55, resigned.
COUSIN BEN => He's hot. Almost too hot. What's in the can?
SKOTAK => Seventy-six dollars -- but it's mostly in nickels.
COUSIN BEN => Give it to me.
COUSIN BEN => You badge in seamanship?
SAM => Yes, sir.
COUSIN BEN => Good. There's cold-water crabber moored off Broken Rock. The skipper owes me an I.O.U. We'll see if he can take you on as a claw cracker. It won't be an easy life, but it's better than shock therapy.
SAM => Thank you, sir. By the way, where's the chapel tent?
COUSIN BEN => Back there, but the padre's home with the mumps. Why do you ask?
SAM => I want to bring my wife.
SUZY => But we're not married yet.
COUSIN BEN => You his girl?
COUSIN BEN => Technically, I'm a civil-law scrivener. I'm authorized to declare births, deaths, and marriages. You're kind of young. You got a license?
COUSIN BEN => I can't offer you a legally binding union. It won't hold up in the state, the county, or, frankly, any courtroom in the world due to your age, lack of a license, and failure to get parental consent -- but the ritual does carry a very important moral weight within yourselves. You can't enter into this lightly. Do you love each other?
COUSIN BEN => Are you sure you're ready for this?
COUSIN BEN => Let me rephrase it.
SUZY =>  We're in a hurry.
COUSIN BEN =>  Spit out the gum, sister. In fact, everybody.
COUSIN BEN => I don't like the snappy attitude. This is the most important decision you've made in your lives. Now go over by that trampoline and talk it through before you give me another quick answer.
SAM => I guess we better try to pretend we're struggling over our decision for a minute before we go back over there and tell him --
SUZY => Maybe he's right. It could be a mistake.
SAM => What? Why? How?
SUZY => Being married. Sometimes it seems sad to me. It might be better to just go steady permanently.
SAM => I don't know what to say.
COUSIN BEN => I guess they're probably just trying to pretend they're struggling over their decision, but at least --
SKOTAK => Woah!
SUZY => We're sure.
COUSIN BEN => OK. Let's do a blood test.
COUSIN BEN => -- which we hereby consecrate on this day, the fifth of September, 1965.  That's the end of the short-form. Do any of the witnesses have objections or remarks? Usually, they don't.
COUSIN BEN => Skotak.
SKOTAK => Can we loan them the nickels? I'm worried about their future.
COUSIN BEN =>  That's my fee.
NICKLEBY => What's going to happen to them?
GADGE => Nobody knows.
DELUCA => Let's take a vote.
SKOTAK => All in favor --
COUSIN BEN =>  That's my fee.
COUSIN BEN => You're just like your brothers. OK, give them the tennis ball can.
COUSIN BEN => Sign here -- and initial here and here.
COUSIN BEN => Take the carbon. Leave the Bible. Let's go.
NICKLEBY => Where they going again?
GADGE => He's going to work on a shrimper, if I understand correctly.
SKOTAK =>  I wish them well.
LAZY-EYE => Me, too. Me, too.
ROOSEVELT => I think they're coming back.
COUSIN BEN => Be quick, sailor!
SKOTAK =>  What happened?
SAM =>  She left her binoculars on a hook in the chapel tent.
DELUCA =>  Just leave them.
SAM => We can't. It's her magic power!
SAM => You killed your dog, by the way.
REDFORD =>  Snoopy?  Well, it couldn't be helped.
SAM => Why do you consider me your enemy?
REDFORD => Because your girlfriend stabbed me in the back with lefty scissors.
SAM => She's my wife now.
REDFORD => Congratulations.
SAM => I'm saying before that. Six weeks ago. From day one. What'd I do wrong? I'm trying to understand.  Why don't you like me?
REDFORD =>  Why should I? Nobody else does.
REDFORD => He's here! The fugitive! Stop him!
SAM => I'm OK.
SAM => Follow me!
COMMANDER PIERCE => Captain Sharp, we've located the missing troop. They just fled camp. We're in 
COMMANDER PIERCE => pursuit. They're accompanied by a twelve- year-old girl in knee-socks and Sunday- school shoes.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Stand by, Commander Pierce.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Jed, re-route to St. Jack Wood. Tell Social Services the boy's been spotted at Fort Lebanon.
JED => Roger that. Will comply.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Becky, notify the Bishops: Suzy's there.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Randy? You monitoring?
BECKY => Hello! Mr. Bishop?
MR. BISHOP => Oh, dear God.
MR. BISHOP => Get the boys.
MRS. BISHOP => Let's go! Right now!
JED => Tower control, this is Jed. Confirm co- ordinates for new destination: alpha-two- two-seven-one-fiver. Looking pretty soupy up here. Wouldn't mind setting down before the pot boils over.  Hang on, Social Services.
WEATHER MAN => Once again: storm waters have just breached the dam at Black Beacon 
WEATHER MAN => Reservoir. A flash flood alert is in effect. Take immediate precautions.
SECRETARY MCINTIRE => That's coming our way.
COMMANDER PIERCE => You find them?
TEAM CAPTAIN => No, sir.
COMMANDER PIERCE =>  Prepare to mobilize to higher ground.
COMMANDER PIERCE => St. Jack Church is the designated storm shelter.  Notify all scouts to muster outside my tent on the double.
BENJAMIN BRITTEN'S => "NOYE'S FLUDDE" Performed by the Choristers of St. Jack Wood and New Penzance 8PM TONIGHT PERFORMANCE CANCELLED
VOICES => More sandbags! We need dry blankets! Wake up the Deacon!
COMMANDER PIERCE => Attention, company! Prepare for --
COMMANDER PIERCE => Who's that?
COMMANDER PIERCE => You call yourself a Khaki Scout?
COMMANDER PIERCE =>  Where's your goddamn troop? They could get killed out there!
COMMANDER PIERCE =>  You're a liability to us.
SECRETARY MCINTIRE =>  The incident may affect our insurance premiums.
COMMANDER PIERCE => I'm field-stripping you of your command.
COMMANDER PIERCE => Attention, company! Prepare for emergency evacuation!
SECRETARY MCINTIRE => Sir, do you have your medicine?
COMMANDER PIERCE => I'll be right back.
SECRETARY MCINTIRE => All accounted for, Scout Master!
COUSIN BEN => Affirmative, sir!
CAPTAIN SHARP => Who's in charge here?
CAPTAIN SHARP => Randy! What happened?
MR. BISHOP => Suzy? Sam?
BECKY => Are you all right?
SOCIAL SERVICES => Where's the boy?
CAPTAIN SHARP => We don't know yet.
SOCIAL SERVICES => That's not acceptable.
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  What do you want me to say, lady?  Somebody get Jed a cup of coffee.
SOCIAL SERVICES => You're Captain Sharp?
CAPTAIN SHARP => That's right.
SOCIAL SERVICES => I'm Social Services. I remanded the boy to your personal custody. You're responsible for his safety. I'm told he was just struck by lightning.
CAPTAIN SHARP => That's the first I heard of it.
SOCIAL SERVICES => Scout Master Ward, I presume?
SOCIAL SERVICES =>  Your reputation precedes you.
SOCIAL SERVICES => You two are the most appallingly incompetent custodial guardians Social Services has ever had the misfortune to ENCOUNTER --  -- in a twenty-seven year career!
SOCIAL SERVICES => What do you have to say for yourselves?
CAPTAIN SHARP => You can't do this. They'll eat him alive in there.
SOCIAL SERVICES =>  Where?
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  What's the name of the place again?
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  Juvenile refuge. That sounds like jail.
SOCIAL SERVICES => Just find the boy -- and deliver him --  -- to Social Services. Nothing else is in your power.
MR. BISHOP =>  I'm sorry.
MR. BISHOP => Can we get back to the rescue now?
MRS. BISHOP =>  Suzy's still out there.
SOCIAL SERVICES =>  Who are you?
SOCIAL SERVICES => The parents of the stabber?
MRS. BISHOP => I object to that description. She was attacked.
COMMANDER PIERCE => I want the details. Where's the scout she knifed?
SECRETARY MCINTIRE => Right here.
REDFORD => Field Mate Redford, sir.
COMMANDER PIERCE =>  What's his condition?
SECRETARY MCINTIRE => He may suffer some limited chronic kidney insufficiency. Here's the report.
MRS. BISHOP => We don't have time for this!
SOCIAL SERVICES => Let's go!
CAPTAIN SHARP => Nobody's going anywhere.
CAPTAIN SHARP => He's not getting shock therapy.
SOCIAL SERVICES => That's it! I'm citing you for gross misconduct! You are hereby summoned to appear before the board of --
CAPTAIN SHARP => I'm writing you up back! Be notified that you stand accused of the mistreatment and IMPROPER --
SOCIAL SERVICES =>  What are you talking about?
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  I won't let you do it!
REDFORD =>  Look!
CAPTAIN SHARP => They're gone.
MR. BISHOP =>  Who?
MRS. BISHOP =>  Suzy?
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  Sam?
SOCIAL SERVICES =>  They're here?
CAPTAIN SHARP => Where'd they go? Answer me!
CAPTAIN SHARP => Halt! Stop!
CAPTAIN SHARP => Stay there!
CAPTAIN SHARP => Where you going? What are you doing? Come down!
CAPTAIN SHARP => Social Services? Do you read me? Over!
SUZY => We might have to swim for it.
SAM => How deep is it? I didn't bring my life jacket.
SUZY => I don't know, but if it's too shallow, we'll break our necks, anyway. Hang onto me.
SAM => OK.
SOCIAL SERVICES => Application denied! I'm sorry! Over!
CAPTAIN SHARP =>  Counsellors? What's the legal perspective? Over!
MR. BISHOP => In this state? I would litigate with extreme confidence.
MRS. BISHOP =>  I concur.
MRS. BISHOP =>  Open with article fifteen of the Codes of Civic Jurisdiction.
MR. BISHOP =>  No party, under any circumstance, shall be denied due and proper consideration...
SUZY => On three again.
SAM =>  Wait. Just in case this is a suicide, or 
SAM => they capture us, and we never see each other again anymore -- thank you for marrying me. I'm glad I got to know you, Suzy.
SUZY => I think you've still got lightning in you.
SAM => Let's jump.
CAPTAIN SHARP => No!
CAPTAIN SHARP => Goddammit!
CAPTAIN SHARP => Tell him! Over!
SOCIAL SERVICES => Captain Sharp is offering to assume the responsibility of foster parenthood!
SOCIAL SERVICES => Is this acceptable to you, Mr. Shakusky?
CAPTAIN SHARP => What do you think, pal?
CAPTAIN SHARP => We're coming down! Over and out.
CAPTAIN SHARP => Don't let go.
NARRATOR => The Black Beacon storm was considered by the U.S. Department of Inclement Weather to be the region's most destructive 
NARRATOR => meteorological event of the second half of the twentieth century.
NARRATOR => It lingered through six high-tides and inundated the islands with punishing winds and extreme high waters.
NARRATOR => On St. Jack Wood, powerful surges broke the arcade boardwalk and demolished the village bandstand and casino.
SKOTAK => Yes, sir.
SKOTAK => He doesn't have one.
NARRATOR => The coastal areas of New Penzance were battered and changed forever.
NARRATOR => Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet was erased from the map.
NARRATOR => But harvest yields the following autumn far exceeded any previously recorded, and the quality of the crops was said to be extraordinary.
RECORD PLAYER => So you see, the composer Benjamin Britten has taken the whole orchestra apart. Now he puts it back together again in a fugue.
MRS. BISHOP => Suzy? Lionel, Murray, Rudy! Dinner!
MR. BISHOP => Don't make us ask twice!
SAM => See you tomorrow.
