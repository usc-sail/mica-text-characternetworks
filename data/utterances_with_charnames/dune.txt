IRULAN => Father. EMPEROR Irulan.
EMPEROR =>  A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
REVEREND MOTHER => We felt his presence.
EMPEROR => I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
REVEREND MOTHER => Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
EMPEROR => Yes?
REVEREND MOTHER => Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
EMPEROR => He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
REVEREND MOTHER => I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
EMPEROR => Leave us.
REVEREND MOTHER => Yes, my Lord.
EMPEROR =>  We are alone...
NAVIGATOR => We have just folded space from Ix...
EMPEROR =>  Yes?... How was your journey?
NAVIGATOR =>  Many machines on Ix... new machines.
EMPEROR => Oh yes? NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
EMPEROR => Is there a problem?... Usually there is a problem when one of you makes a visit.
NAVIGATOR =>  The answer is within the problem...
NAVIGATOR => I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
EMPEROR => Yes.
NAVIGATOR => You must share with us. EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
NAVIGATOR => So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
EMPEROR => Yes.
NAVIGATOR =>  Reverend Mother... I will give you the Tleilaxu Path.
REVEREND MOTHER =>  A chance for escape? But for whom?
EMPEROR => Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
NAVIGATOR => LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
REVEREND MOTHER => He shouldn't speak of this...
NAVIGATOR => ...gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhood the metaphysical ability to see beyond...to have superior powers... Our power to fold space is in the spice... Without us, your empire would be lost on isolated scattered planets... You would be lost.
EMPEROR => I can assure you...
NAVIGATOR => Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
REVEREND MOTHER => Here it comes...
NAVIGATOR => We ourselves... foresee a slight problem within House Atreides.... Paul.... Paul Atreides.
EMPEROR => You mean, of course, Duke Leto Atreides... his father. Page missing 24.  EXT. CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT
PAUL =>  Here we are now... nineteen light years beyond...
PAUL =>  ... beyond Epsilon Alangue... is Arrakis.
PAUL =>  It does look dry....
Arrakeen Valley. => FILMBOOK Each day the palms along the outer wall of the Palace at Arrakeen consume enough water to sustain the lives of one hundred men. The palms were placed by the Harkonnens to flaunt their water wealth in front of the city Fremen.
PAUL => Where are the Harkonnens from here?
PAUL =>  There!... Geidi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen... the enemy.
PAUL =>  I know, Thufir, I'm sitting with my back to the door.
PAUL => I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
THUFIR => Those sounds could be imitated.
PAUL => I'd know the difference.
THUFIR =>  Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
PAUL => My father sent you to test me. Music then?
GURNEY => No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
PAUL => Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
GURNEY =>  Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
PAUL => I'm sorry Gurney.
GURNEY => Not sorry enough.
GURNEY =>  Guard yourself for true!
PAUL =>  What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
PAUL =>  Is this what you seek?
GURNEY =>  Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
GURNEY => We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
PAUL => Would you really have drawn my blood?
GURNEY => If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
PAUL => Things have been so serious here lately.
GURNEY => Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
PAUL => Dr. Yueh, do you have any information on the worms of Arrakis? DR. YUEH I have obtained a filmbook on a small specimen... only 125 meters long.
PAUL => Only?!
DR. YUEH => There are have been documented sightings of worms as large as 450 meters in the deep desert -- far from where we'll be in Arakeen.... The desert belt and the south polar regions are marked forbidden.... Why?
PAUL => The storms and the worms. Is it true, that the sand can blow at seven hundred kilometers per hour?
YUEH => It can render flesh to dust in minutes. And these dry winds can generate tremendous static electricity in the atmosphere. Our body shields won't have enough power to operate in the open air on Arrakis.
PAUL => Well, how do the Fremen survive there?
YUEH => We don't know much about the Fremen... They live in the deep desert... some of them in the cities and they have blue- within-blue eyes...
PAUL =>  The eyes -- yes, yes... saturation of the blood by the spice -- melange. Could the spice affect us in other ways?
THUFIR => Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
PAUL =>  The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke!
THUFIR => Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
PAUL => I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
THUFIR => We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
THUFIR => Clear and lock the room.
THUFIR => Activate a fighter.
GURNEY =>  Precise control....
PAUL => The bull that killed my grandfather... is this an evil omen?
PAUL =>  Duncan!
DUNCAN => Paul.  I was on my way to say goodbye to you.  I have to go on ahead.
PAUL => Why?  I wish you were coming with us.
DUNCAN => It's something for your father.  He wants to talk to you.  I'll see you in Arrakis.  May the hand of God be with you.
PAUL => May the hand of God be with us all, Duncan.
PAUL =>  Father.
DUKE LETO => Thank you for joining me, Paul.  It will be good to get to our new home and have all this upset behind us. 28A.
DUKE LETO =>  My son.  Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides three generations....  He swears you are the finest student he's ever taught. Yueh, Gurney and Duncan say the same.... It makes me feel very proud...
PAUL => I want you to be proud of me.
DUKE LETO =>  I'll miss the sea... but a person needs new experiences... they jar something deep inside, allowing him to grow.  Without change, something sleeps inside us... and seldom awakens... The sleeper must awaken.
PAUL => Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet...Arrakis... Desert Planet... moving... moving.
PAUL => Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.
VOICE => The second moon, your moon...
BEAUTIFUL GIRL => Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.
JESSICA =>  I  know she has come to test him... no man has ever been tested with the box... only Bene Gesserit women. I may lose my son.
PAUL =>  Arrakis... Dune... Desert planet... moving... moving.
REVEREND MOTHER => We'll salvage what we can... but I can tell you.. dear God... for the father... nothing.
REVEREND MOTHER => Did you really think that you could bear the Kwisatz Haderach?... How dare you!
REVEREND MOTHER => My greatest student... and my greatest disappointment.... He's awake!... He's listening to us.  Good... Ready yourself, young Paul Atreides... I want to see you in your mother's chamber in one quarter of an hour.
JESSICA => Paul?... This is very important...
PAUL => Kwisatz Haderach?... For the father... nothing?
REVEREND MOTHER =>  Jessica... You were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides... Jessica!
JESSICA => It meant so much to him...
REVEREND MOTHER => You thought only of a Duke's desire for a son?... Desires don't figure in this! An Atreides daughter could have been wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. We may lose both blood lines now.
JESSICA => I vowed never to regret my decision. I'll pay for my own mistakes.
REVEREND MOTHER => And your son will pay with you.
JESSICA => Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
JESSICA => Your Reverence.
PAUL =>  What does she fear?  What about my Father?
JESSICA => Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
REVEREND MOTHER =>  Now you come here.
PAUL =>  She's using The Voice.  No.
REVEREND MOTHER =>  Some strength there. Surprising!  Come here.
REVEREND MOTHER => See this... Put your right hand in the box.
PAUL => What's in the box?
REVEREND MOTHER => Pain.
REVEREND MOTHER =>  STOP! Put your hand in the box.
PAUL =>  The Voice again.
REVEREND MOTHER => I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
PAUL => Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
REVEREND MOTHER => Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
PAUL =>  It burns.
REVEREND MOTHER => SILENCE... SILENCE.
PAUL =>  I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
REVEREND MOTHER => You feel the flesh crisping?
REVEREND MOTHER => Flesh dropping off.
PAUL =>  THE PAIN!
REVEREND MOTHER => NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
REVEREND MOTHER =>  Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
PAUL => I see the truth of it. REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
PAUL => I know it.
REVEREND MOTHER => Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
PAUL => Not all of them... I know which ones will.
REVEREND MOTHER => Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
PAUL => What is it?
REVEREND MOTHER =>  The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
PAUL => Where?
REVEREND MOTHER => Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
PAUL => I have heard of it. REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
PAUL => Did they try and fail?
REVEREND MOTHER => They tried and died....  Jessica!
REVEREND MOTHER => I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
PAUL => I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
JESSICA => Paul!
PAUL => Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
REVEREND MOTHER => What can be done has been done.
PAUL => MOTHER! Tell me!
PITER => It is by will alone I set my mind in motion. It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed - The lips acquire stains - The stains become a warning - It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.
PITER => My Lord!
BARON => Piter.
PITER => The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.
BARON => What does Leto say, Piter?
PITER => He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
BARON =>  I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
PITER => As you instructed me, I have enlightened your nephews concerning my plan t... BARON My plan!
PITER => The plan to crush the Atreides.  Feyd, Rabban... go quietly... no other great house of the Landsraad must ever know of the Emperor's aid to the Baron.  The entire Landsraad would turn against the Baron and the Emperor.
DOCTOR => Put the pick in there Pete And turn it round real neat.
BARON =>  You're so beautiful my Baron Your skin, love to me Your diseases lovingly cared for For all eternity.
BARON => I will have Arrakis back for myself... he who controls the Spice, controls the universe... and what Piter didn't tell you is we have control of someone who is very close to Duke Leto.  This person... this traitor... will be worth more to us than ten legions of Sardaukar.
FEYD => Who is the traitor?
BARON =>  I won't tell you who the traitor is or when we'll attack.  However, the Duke will die before these eyes and he'll know that it is I -- Baron Vladimir Harkonnen -- who encompasses his doom. The Baron gives a hand signal and seven gates in the wall open, emitting tremendous SOUNDS.  Suddenly the Baron begins to float straight up, twenty-five feet in the air.  It is a frightening sight.  He floats down under the giant, humming electrical tube light and rubs his head and body with a black fluid which drips from tiny holes in either side of the pink glow.  Feyd and Rabban watch nervously.  The Attendants stand completely still with fear.
JESSICA =>   I must not fear.  Fear is the mind- killer... the little death that brings total obliteration...
DUKE LETO => Soon they'll begin to fold space.
PAUL =>  Far off in the control rooms.... Travelling without moving.
66. => 67.  INT. MILITARY SUB-BASEMENT ROOM - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY
ATREIDES TECHNICIAN => Harkonnens.
THUFIR =>  Why isn't the shield up yet?
THUFIR =>  We found these sabotage devices too easily...
DR. YUEH => Listen here.... You can here the people of Arrakeen outside.... Can you here the cry "Soo Soo Sook" of the water sellers?
JESSICA => So many reminders of the scarcity of water.
DR. YUEH => Have you noticed the line of palms along the wall... the Harkonnen put them in... to flaunt their water wealth in front of these people.... Each day those palms take enough water to sustain the life of one hundred men.
JESSICA => The way you say Harkonnen... I didn't know you had so much reason to hate them.
DR. YUEH =>  My wife... you didn't know my wife... they... JESSICA  Forgive me...  ... His wife was Bene Gesserit too... the signs are al over him.... They must have killed here.
DR. YUEH => I'm sorry I'm unable to talk about it.
DR. YUEH => The Harkonnens may have tampered medically.... please wait.
JESSICA =>  He's hiding something -- holding something back.  It's not just his wife... He's a good man though. He's probably trying to save my feelings...  I could use The Voice... make him tell me... It would only shame him.  I must place more trust in my friends. (We see Yueh turn toward her, fearful.) 77.  INT. PASSAGEWAY - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY
NARRATOR => One carryall handles four spice mining teams; however, it will fly only two harvesters at a time. Today, we have nine hundred and thirty harvesters and nine hundred and eighty-one carryalls....
PAUL =>  Spice...
PAUL =>  Terrible purpose.... What is it?
Page Missing => SHADOUT MAPES I am the Shadout Mapes... the housekeeper.
PAUL => A Fremen... Could she be the operator? No...
SHADOUT MAPES => I must cleanse the way between us.... You saved my life... and we  Fremen pay our debts. It's known to us that you've a traitor in your midst. Who it is we cannot say but we're certain of it.
PAUL =>  A traitor...
PAUL =>  There is a traitor among us.
THUFIR => Set up a sonar probe immediately!
DUKE LETO =>  Thufir?... anything?... keep looking.  ...and a traitor... God help us.
THUFIR =>  Sector 6 - 80 -- copy the sixth -- the summit -- the eight the quadrant over the ninth plus eighty -- four circles -- weave the eighty and call the fourth copy -- enter nine -- seven by seven a seven the seven call seven B seven -- enter the circles call the sixth copy the sixth over the summit.... eight.
THUFIR =>  Eight.... Thufir Hawat... Mentat... Master of Assassins.
THUFIR => The Palace is now secure. The city of Arrakeen is under martial law... we have troops here headquartered underground on sub-floors six through ten. The rest of the troops are stationed in Arrakeen and we have some on the airfield. Our new army is still training, but everything is shielded.... With the shielding, we are impenetrable. Dr. Kynes is waiting, Sire, for your inspection of spice mining operations, but since the attempt of the young master, I am against your leaving the Palace.
DUKE LETO =>  The attempt failed... Harkonnen captives have already been taken. We must crush the Harkonnen machine on Arrakis.... You all know what to do.  ...Gurney! We desperately need more spice miners... many are threatening to leave on the next shuttle. We need spice drivers, weather scanners, dune men ... any with open sand experience. You must persuade them to enlist with us. GURNEY They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup as the east wind. And they shall gather the captivity of the sand.
DUKE LETO =>  Very moving, Gurney. On your way... and take care of Dr. Kynes until Paul and I arrive. We will not be prisoners here in this place.
GURNEY =>  Behold as a wild ass in the desert go I forth to my work.
JESSICA =>  I must speak with you Leto! 91.  INT. PASSAGEWAY - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY
JESSICA =>  Yes?
SHADOUT MAPES => I am the Shadout Mapes, your housekeeper, Noble Born. What are your orders.
JESSICA => You may refer to me as "my lady." I am not noble born. I'm the bound concubine of Duke Leto -- mother of the heir designate.... "Shadout"... that's an ancient word.
MAPES =>  You know the ancient tongues?
JESSICA => I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
MAPES => As the legend says.
JESSICA =>  That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
JESSICA => I know many things. I know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice. MAPES My lady, I... the weapon was sent as a gift if you should prove to be the one.
JESSICA => And the means of my death should I prove otherwise.  Now we will see which way the decision tips.
MAPES => Do you know this my lady?
JESSICA =>  It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
MAPES => Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
JESSICA =>  Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death.  It's a maker...
JESSICA =>  Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
MAPES => My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
JESSICA =>  There's more here... yes!  Mapes, you've sheathed that blade unblooded.
MAPES => Take the water of my life!
MAPES => You are ours.... You are the one.
KYNES =>  So, this is Leto the Just...
GURNEY =>  I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
KYNES =>  Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...
DUKE LETO => So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
KYNES =>  I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
DUKE LETO => This is my son, Paul.
PAUL => Are you a Fremen?
KYNES => I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
PAUL =>  He's hiding something.
DUKE LETO => I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
KYNES => They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
PAUL => "Your gift is a blessing of the river."
KYNES =>  The Mahdi will greet you with holy words and your gifts will be a blessing.  Most of the desert natives here are a superstitious lot. They mean no harm. With your permission, I will check the security of your suits.
GURNEY =>  The Duke is to be addresses as... Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
KYNES => Basically...
GURNEY =>  Sire!
DUKE LETO => It's all right Gurney.
GURNEY => Yes, Sire.
KYNES => It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
KYNES => With a Fremen suit in good working order, one can sustain life for weeks, even in the deep desert.
DUKE LETO => My thanks.
KYNES => With your permission...
expression. => KYNES You've worn a stillsuit before?
PAUL => No.
KYNES => Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
PAUL => No one. It... seemed the proper way.
KYNES => That it is.  He shall know your ways as if born to them.
GURNEY => We're wasting time, Sire.
JESSICA =>  I must speak with you Leto!
93D. => 93E. EXT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY
KYNES => Southeast over the Shield Wall. That's where I told your sandmaster to concentrate his harvesting.
PAUL => Will we see a worm?
KYNES => Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
PAUL => Always?
KYNES => Always.
PAUL => Why do they come?
KYNES => To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
GURNEY => The young master is a trained Mentat, an advanced student of Prana Bindu has studied under some of the finest teachers in the Universe.
KYNES => As I said... they defend the spice sands. As to their relationship with the spice... who knows.
GURNEY => Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
KYNES => That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
DUKE LETO => Wormsign? Is it wormsign? KYNES Yes!... worm. Big one! You've got sharp eyes Sire.... May I?
KYNES =>  Calling Harvester Pad Nine. Wormsign!
VOICE =>  Who calls Pad Nine?
GURNEY =>  Don't mention the Duke... This is an uncoded channel.
KYNES => Unlisted flight northeast of you... wormsign on intercept course... estimated contact fifteen minutes.
VOICE =>  Have sighting confirmed. Stand by for fix. Contact in sixteen minutes minus. Very precise estimate. Who is on that unlisted flight?
DUKE LETO => What happens now?
KYNES => The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
KYNES => They'll work until the very last minute.
VOICE =>  Spotter control... no sign of the carryall... it isn't answering.
GURNEY => The worm is eight minutes away, Sire.
VOICE =>  Spotter control -- give me a report by the numbers.
DUKE LETO => Damn it... Harkonnens.
DUKE LETO =>  We are coming down to take you off the harvester... All spotters are ordered to comply.
VOICE =>  Ordered by whom? DUKE LETO  Duke Leto Atreides....
VOICE =>  Yes... yes, Sire!
DUKE LETO => How many men do you have?
VOICE =>  Full crew -- twenty-six men -- but Sire, we can't leave this spice...
DUKE LETO => Damn the spice! Get out of there.
DUKE LETO =>  Two men in each of the spotters... You!... over here... run!!
KYNES =>  Damn sloppy -- really damn sloppy.
GURNEY => Come on boys... come on.  We're going to be heavy, Sire.
KYNES =>  Here he is... We've got to go.
PAUL =>  Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
KYNES =>  Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
DUKE LETO =>  What's that you're saying?
KYNES => Nothing.
silent. => SPICE MINER #1  Liet!
PAUL =>  Liet?
KYNES =>  You are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  Watch!
GURNEY => Gods, what a monster.
DUKE LETO => Someone is going to pay for this... I promise.
KYNES =>  This Duke is more concerned over his men than the spice!  I must admit... against all better judgement... I like this Duke.
DUKE LETO =>  Duncan!  What have you discovered about the Fremen, Duncan -- tell me.  Why haven't we heard from you?
DUNCAN => My lord... I suspect so much.  I think they are the allies we seek... they are strong and fierce... they do not give their loyalty easily or quickly....  As you know, the Imperium has never been able to take a census of the Fremen.  Everyone thinks that there are but few -- wandering here and there in the desert.... My lord, I suspect an incredible secret has been kept on this planet... that the Fremen exist in vast numbers... vast numbers... and it is they that control Arrakis.
DUKE LETO => Guard.  Open the door.
DUKE LETO => Sleep well... my son.
PAUL =>  Father!... father... drugged... 122. INT. BARON'S QUARTERS - HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT
DUKE LETO => What happened?  What?  The shield!
DUKE LETO =>  Yueh!  He's sabotaged the house generators, we're wide open.
YUEH =>  I've brought House Atreides down.  I've destroyed the new army's weirding modules.
DUKE LETO =>  ... Why?
YUEH => I wish to kill a man... not you, my dear Duke, but the Baron....  You were dead already... but you will be close to the Baron before you die.  You will be tied and drugged but you can still attack. When you see the Baron you will have a new poison tooth.  He will want you close so he can gloat over you.  One bite on this tooth and a strong exile...
DUKE LETO => Refuse...
YUEH => No! -- You mustn't... for in return I will save the lives of your Paul and Jessica.
YUEH => For Paul...
YUEH => When you see the Baron, remember the tooth!  The tooth!
ATREIDES GUARD => The shield!  The shield!
GURNEY => LONG LIVE DUKE LETO!
TROOPERS => Long live Duke Leto!
BARON => The drug was timed.  Dr. Yueh has been very valuable to us....  What a pity you must remain gagged.  We can't let ourselves be swayed by your witch's Voice, now, can we?
JESSICA =>  Leto... where are you?
BARON => Goodbye, Jessica and goodbye to your sweet son....  I want to spit once on your head... just some spittle on your face -- what a luxury.
BARON => We were ordered to kill them... so kill them.
NEFUD => What are your orders, Piter?
PITER => Take them to the desert, as the traitor suggested and worms will destroy the evidence.  Their bodies must never be found. 129. BACK TO SCENE - BATTLE
PITER =>  I'd thought of many pleasures with you. It is perhaps better that you die in the innards of a worm.  Desire clouds my reason....  That is not good... that is bad.
DUNCAN => They're on this floor somewhere....
PAUL =>  Duncan!!  Duncan!!
ARRAKEEN PALACE => - NIGHT - SHIELD EFFECT
BARON =>  You wish now to join your wife, is that it, traitor?
YUEH => She lives?
BARON => You wish to join her... join her, then.
BARON => Take him away.
RABBAN => He was in the Palace with the Atreides... I also say he was a spy for the Emperor.  Go now!  Take him to his desert to die. Go!
JESSICA =>  Yueh's sign.  He's left a satchell.
PAUL =>  Don't touch my mother...
JESSICA =>  Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
JESSICA =>  The calming exercise.
PAUL =>  Remove her gag!
JESSICA =>  Excellent!
JESSICA =>  There's no need to fight over me.
JESSICA =>  First cut my son's bonds. Guard #1 slowly cuts Paul's big straps, never taking his eyes off Jessica.  The ornithopter gets closer and closer to the top jagged surface of the Shield Wall.
JESSICA =>  That's it.
JESSICA => Oh, my God!
BARON => Duke Leto Atreides.  Someone's torn the insignia off your uniform.  Such carelessness.
PITER => It was Feyd.
BARON => It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
PITER => The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
BARON => You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
DUKE LETO =>  Yueh... Yueh... dead... Paul and Jessica safe... the tooth!
PITER => He's coming round, my Lord.
DUKE LETO =>  Wait... he must be near...
BARON => Where is your ring?
BARON => You do not answer!
DUKE LETO =>  A... little... closer....  The... water... of my life... for Paul.
DUKE LETO => Now!
JESSICA => Leto!  Leto!
JESSICA =>  Leto!  He's dead!  He's dead... PAUL I know  I have NO FEELINGS!!  Why?
BARON =>  I'm alive!!!  I'm alive!!!
PAUL => I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
JESSICA => Where are we do you think?
PAUL => The South Polar regions... the forbidden area.  We must make it to that rock...
PAUL => Hurry!
JESSICA => Bring these satchels!
PAUL =>  Hurry -- This crashing may bring a worm.
JESSICA =>  A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
PAUL =>  Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
PAUL =>  The second moon... from the dreams...
PAUL =>  House Atreides is ruined.  This moon holds my past.
PAUL => This moon holds my future. 139E.     INT. WATER - NIGHT
PAUL => I am only a seed...
DUKE LETO => The seed must grow.
DUKE LETO => The sleeper must awaken.
PAUL => Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... JESSICA Calm yourself/
PAUL => The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
JESSICA =>  Is he....?
PAUL => You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
JESSICA =>  He knows.
PAUL => You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
PAUL =>  Father... now I have become a killer and I will continue to kill until I have avenged your death.  Father!
BARON =>  Rabban!!... we're knee deep in Atreides blood!  We've gutted them.  We've gutted them! 
BARON => Rabban, Rabban...  I place you in charge of Arrakis.  It's yours to squeeze, as I promised.  I want you to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze.  Give me spice!  Drive them into utter submission.  You must not show the slightest pity or mercy... as only you can...  Never stop!  Go....  Show no mercy!
RABBAN => Yes, my lord Baron.
BARON =>  And when we've crushed these people enough I'll send in you Feyd... they'll cheer you as a rescuer... lovely Feyd... really a lovely boy.  Where's my doctor?
PAUL =>  Yueh's left the plans for the weirding modules.
PAUL => We have to get to that mountain of rock. We have entered the time when all will turn against us and seek our lives...
PAUL => It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
JESSICA =>  ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
PAUL =>  Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
JESSICA =>  I'm ready.
PAUL => Keep going...
PAUL => Faster!! JESSICA  It's deafening!
PAUL =>  Run!
JESSICA => I can't... I can't.
PAUL => Drum sand!
PAUL =>  Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
JESSICA => Yes...
PAUL =>  I know the secret.  The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.
JESSICA => Paul!
PAUL =>  A thumper.
climbing back. => JESSICA  What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
PAUL =>  Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
JESSICA =>  Man-carved steps.
PAUL =>  Yes...
STILGAR => Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
STILGAR =>  Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
JESSICA => No, but many consider my training valuable.
STILGAR => I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
STILGAR => Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
JESSICA => Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
A FREMEN => It is the legend.
CHANI => I am Chani, daughter of Liet....  I would not have permitted you to harm my tribe.
PAUL =>  From my dream... so beautiful.  Liet.... is this Kynes' daughter?
CHANI => Come with me.  I'll show you an easier way down.
STILGAR =>  You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
PAUL =>  What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
STILGAR => We call that one Muad'dib.
PAUL => Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
STILGAR => You are Paul Muad'dib, and your mother shall be a Sayyadina among us....  We welcome you.
distance. => CHANI Seitch Tabr.
CHANI => Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.
JESSICA => Moisture...
PAUL => Wind traps... huge ones.
shocks Paul. => 179. INT. RESERVOIR  -SIETCH TABR - NIGHT
PAUL =>  Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
STILGAR => Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
STILGAR => The Rocks of Arrakis hold many secrets.
MONK => We sense that you may be the "voice from the outer world".  Both moons told us of you.  You must pass tests before we will know... you must conquer the beast of the desert, both his outer and his deadly inner powers.  Speak to us... from the outer world.
PAUL =>  I am only a seed.  I am Usul... Paul Muad'dib. CROWDS  Muad'dib!
MONK => The legend.
PAUL =>  No one ever dreamed there would be so many.  Our shared enemy the Harkonnens, are once again in control of Arrakis.  Stilgar, your leader, has asked me and my mother to crush the Harkonnens.  We must do more than this.  We must totally destroy all spice production on Arrakis.  The Guild and the entire universe depends on spice.
Universe. =>  The dream unfolds.
PAUL => The weirding way has long been a Bene Gesserit secret.  With my mother's help, my father isolated an element of the weirding way and externalised it. PAUL Because of the Harkonnen treachery, my father's armies were never able to fully develop this new form.  This is what I will teach you.  You will be the fiercest and most feared fighters in the Universe.
Orato! =>  This obelisk is of your hardest stone. Kick it...  Hit it...  Yell at it...
ORATO => Break!
PAUL => Move back!
PAUL => Chuksa!
100 FREMEN => Achiii! PAUL This is part of the weirding way that we will teach you.  Some thoughts have a certain sound... that being the equivalent to a form.  Through sound and motion you will be able to paralyze nerves, shatter bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy or burst his organs....  We will kill until no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.
100 FREMEN => Muad'dib!
PAUL =>  To avenge my father, I will turn you into killing machines.
STILGAR => Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
JESSICA =>  They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
STILGAR => Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
JESSICA =>  I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
STILGAR =>  Do you know the Water of Life?... Come... ...Watch... the mystery of mysteries... the end and the beginning.
STILGAR => The Water of Life.
PAUL =>  The most lethal poison in the Universe.
REVEREND MOTHER => ... Many men have tried.
PAUL => Did they try and fail?
REVEREND MOTHER => They tried and died.
MONK #1 => One among us has consented to enter the rite.  She will attempt to pass within that we not lose the strength of our Reverend Mother.
PAUL =>  What if she should fail?
MONK #1 => Drink!
JESSICA =>  The ultimate awareness spectrum narcotic. I must transform the poison configuration within my body... the blue must be made clean.
JESSICA =>  No!  This is the place where we cannot look.  The place only for the eyes of the Kwisatz Haderach.
JESSICA => What is this?...  Is this what kills the men who enter here?
JESSICA =>  Now my daughter and I are both Reverend Mothers.
MONK => Change it that we may all drink of it. Jessica spews water into the spout.  The monk swirls the jug, sniffs at the spout and then drinks.
MONK => It is changed!
PAUL =>  She did it!
CHANI =>  Come with me.
PAUL => Chani....  I love you... I've always loved you.... 204. through 209.
BARON =>  Feyd, even though he's aging, Thufir is one of the finest Mentats in the Universe... and he's mine, Feyd... all mine....  Quiet now.
FEYD => I will.
BARON => Oh Thufir, I see they've installed your heart plug already....  Don't be angry. Everyone gets one here.  But this is not why we're here.  We've brought you a little cat, Thufir.  You must care for it if you wish to live.  A poison has been introduced into you, Thufir Hawat.  By milking this smooth little cat body each day you receive your antidote... it must be done each day....  Also, you must do something for me if you wish to live.  You know I lost Piter, my dear Mentat...
FEYD => All I can see is an Atreides that I want to kill.
BARON => Feyd, no, no!  Thufir's a Harkonnen now, aren't you Thufir?
THUFIR =>  My dear Duke... how I have failed you. 211. INT. JESSICA'S ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT
HARAH => What will you call her?
JESSICA => Alia.
ALIA => Mother.
PAUL => Activate your weirding modules...
PAUL => Set the range for two meters.
PAUL => Korba...  The arm...
KORBA =>  Chuuk-sa...
PAUL => Motion... Chuuk-sa...
KORBA => Chuuuk-sa...
A FREMEN => Muad'dib!...
PAUL =>  My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
STILGAR =>  Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
PAUL => Now! Stilgar signals, and Fremen run behind them.
PAIL =>  They're even better on the battlefield than in the training rooms!!  Sound... as a weapon.  If only you could see them, father.
PAUL =>  When the spice flow stops, the entire Universe will turn to Arrakis.  The Baron and the Emperor himself will be forced to deal with us.
RABBAN => What happened?  What happened to you? What is he saying?
WOUNDED HARKONNEN => Muad'dib!...  Muad'dib!... Muad'dib!... Muad'dib!
RABBAN => Who is this Muad'dib?
Stilgar turns. => STILGAR  Usul... It is time you become a sandrider... and travel as a Fremen.  Take the kiswa maker hook of our sietch and ride as a leader of men.
STILGAR => Two thumpers are planted.  The worm may not surface for the first - he will rise for the second.  Remember, when the worm approaches, you must be utterly still... and close enough to plant the hook firmly under a ring segment....  The worm will turn to lift this exposed area as far from the abrasive sand as possible and it will take you with it -- to the top.  Do not get too close as he approaches... the sand will engulf you....  Wait till the head of the worm passes -- then go... quickly.
PAUL =>  Only the very strong ones travel this deep....
STILGAR =>  Usul has called a big one.  Again... it is the legend.
218. => 219. EXT. DEEP DESERT - DAY
PAUL =>  A sandrider!...
the body... => 219E.     EXT. DESERT - DAY
PAUL =>  Long live the fighters!
VOICE => Seventeen Great Houses of the Lansraad have reported a significant delay in delivery of spice per CHOAM agreement. This constitutes a serious violation of CHOAM codes.  Contact Baron Vladimir Harkonnen immediately.
RABBAN => Falsify the reports.  We can't hide it all, tell them we've lost only two hundred harvesters... and forty carryalls... and don't let my uncle know about the destruction of the spice silos....  I will catch this Muad'dib and suck the blood from him!!  SUCK THE BLOOD FROM HIM!!! 219J. through 222.
PAUL => We surprised a band of smugglers.
STILGAR =>  Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
PAUL => Gurney!...
PAUL => You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
GURNEY =>  Paul!!  Paul!!
PAUL => Don't you trust your own eyes.
GURNEY => They said you were dead.  They said...
GURNEY => You young pup!  You young pup! 227. NEW SCENE - WORLD REPORT
VOICE => Stand-by... warning... we have just received a coded threat from the Guild. Spice production is in serious jeopardy... Giedi Prime supplying false reports... Guild to visit Emperor in one standard day.
EMPEROR => What do you mean one last...
EMPEROR => But he was said to...
EMPEROR => Who is this Paula Atreides to the Guild? And why?
HARAH => Your Reverence, I don't wish to upset you, but the other women...
HARAH => ...they don't like Alia around.  She frightens them.  It is the strangeness of your daughter.
JESSICA => It's the way she speaks of things...
JESSICA => ...beyond her years and of things no child could know -- things of the past. 
JESSICA => A daughter who knew at birth everything I know...
HARAH => But Your Reverence, they won't have her around them.
ALIA =>  Harah!  Would they deny me the right to use this mind?... ALIA  Would they deny me the right to use this voice?...
JESSICA => Alia!
EMPEROR =>  I want fifty legions of Sardaukar on Arrakis at once.
EMPEROR => This is genocide...  the deliberate and systematic destruction of all life on Arrakis.
CHANI => You were calling my name... it frightened me. Page Missing In the hollow of a huge dune, Paul stops with Chani. They share a look into each other's eyes.  Paul turns towards the Fedaykin and nods.  They move in quickly to tie and wrap Paul in Fremen rope.  They move back and wait quietly.  Chani moves in very close to Paul.  She holds a glass vial of the blue water of life.
PAUL => Hurry!  All I see is darkness.
CHANI => Paul... I will love you forever... in life or in death... let Shai-Hulud judge now.  You are my life.
PAUL =>  Now... the test of the water of life... what is it that waits for me in this darkness?
JESSICA => ALIA!
ALIA => Mother - help me!
JESSICA =>  Alia!  What is it? ALIA It's Paul.  He's taken the Water of Life.
CHANI => Paul... Paul. 240B.     EXT. WAVE CRASHING
PAUL => Father!...  Father!  THE SLEEPER HAS AWAKENED.
PAUL => Arrakis... Dune... Desert Planet.
PAUL =>  Your time has come.  Father... our time has come.  A storm is coming -- our storm... and when it comes it will shake the Universe. Emperor... we come for you.
PAUL =>  Long live the fighters!
STILGAR => Long live the fighters!
PAUL => Gurney, when the storm hits... set off the atomics.  I want an opening through the entire Shield Wall.  Stilgar?  Do we have wormsign?
STILGAR => Usul... We have wormsign, the likes of which even God has never seen.
EMPEROR => Bring in that floating fat man... the Baron.
EMPEROR => Why have you brought me here?
BARON => Your Highness... There must be some mistake... I never requested your presence.
EMPEROR => Ah?  But your lack of action demanded it. Your dreadful mismanagement, your bad judgement in assigning to Rabban --  -- the governorship....  You forced me to come here and set things straight... personally. A VOICE Bring in the messenger.
ALIA => I am the messenger from Muad'dib.  Poor Emperor, I'm afraid my brother won't be very pleased with you.
EMPEROR => Silence!...  I do not court your brother's pleasure.
REVEREND MOTHER =>  Kill this child!!  She's an abomination!! Kill her. (points to Alia, who is smiling at her) Get out of my mind!!!
ALIA => Not until you tell them both who I really am.
REVEREND MOTHER =>  Sister of Paul Muad'dib.
EMPEROR => Paul's sister... Paul is Muad'dib?!
PAUL =>  Alia keeps pace with the storm. Gurney and Stilgar don't understand.  Suddenly enormous dust clouds and LIGHTNING sweep up over the Shield Wall.
PAUL => Gurney, now!
GURNEY =>  Atomics!
ALIA => My brother is coming... with many Fremen warriors.
EMPEROR => Impossible!
ALIA => Not impossible.  I told you... He is here now.
EMPEROR =>  Release the Sardaukar.  Baron... give this little abomination to the storm.
BARON => I have her, Majesty!
PAUL => Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
GURNEY => My Lord?
PAUL => Let him stand free!
FEYD =>  The antidote...
GURNEY =>  Thufir.  Come.
PAUL =>  A knife....  In payment of the many years of service to my family, you may know ask of me anything you wish.  Anything at all.  Do you need my life, old friend?
PAUL =>  It is yours.
PAUL => I mean this, Thufir.  If you are to strike, do it now.
urgently. => THUFIR Three... generations... of you...
PAUL =>  Carry this noble Atreides warrior away. Do him all honor.
PAUL => Emperor Shadam the IV... there are Guild Heighliners above us containing many Great Houses of the Lansraad....  SEND THEM BACK!
EMPEROR => How dare you speak to me...
GUILDSMAN #2 =>  Stop your speaking!!
PAUL =>  Good.  You have some idea of what I would do but I will tell it to one who has never been seen... one who hides deep in the Heighliner control rooms.  He will hear it first.
GUILDSMEN #3 =>  No!
PAUL => Where are you....  Let me see you or there will be no spice. We move into very thick gas and there is a ROARING. Suddenly Paul sees the Third Stage Navigator.
PAUL => You know what I'm about to say is true.... I have the power to destroy the spice forever.
PAUL => Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
REVEREND MOTHER => Stop him, Jessica!
JESSICA => Stop him yourself.
PAUL => You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
REVEREND MOTHER => You mustn't speak of...
PAUL =>  SILENCE!
PAUL => I remember your gom jabbar, now you remember mine.  I can kill with a word. A Fedaykin stand forward and recites from the prophecy.
FEDAYKIN #1 => ...and his word shall carry death eternal to those who stand against the righteous.
FEYD => The righteous!
PAUL =>  There is a Harkonnen among you.  Give the Harkonnen a blade and let him stand forth.
EMPEROR => If Feyd wishes, he can meet you with my blade in his hand.
FEYD => I wish it. 
GURNEY => This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
PAUL => The Emperor's blade.
FEYD => Why prolong the inevitable?  I will kill you!  I will kill him!
CHANI => Paul!
FEYD =>  Who is the little one?  A pet, perhaps? Will she deserve my special attentions?
FEYD =>  You see... your death... my blade will finish you.
FEDAYKIN #2 => Usul no longer needs the weirding module.
PAUL => Now, I will tell you how it will be. Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way for an Atreides to take the throne.
EMPEROR => I sit on the throne!! PAUL You will sit on a throne on Selusa Secundus, your prison planet.  Either that or you will die.
PAUL =>  The Princess shall have no more of me than my name... no child of mine or touch the softness of glance... nor instant of desire....  This is my promise to you...  ...my love.
JESSICA => Think on it Chani... We who carry the name of concubine... history will call us wives.
PAUL => The Fremen have the word of Muad'dib. They will have their Holy War to cleanse the Universe... they will have Arrakis... Dune... their planet.  There will be flowing water here open to the sky and rich green oases.  For the spice there will always be some desert.  There will be fierce winds and trials to toughen men. We Fremen have a saying...  "God created Arrakis to train the faithful." One cannot go against the word of God.
ALIA => And how can this be?
ALIA => For... he is the Kwisatz Haderach! 284. EXT. ARRAKEEN PALACE - DUSK
