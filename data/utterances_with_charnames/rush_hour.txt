REPORTER =>  Eager to mend its tarnished image, Los Angeles has really put out the welcome mat for tomorrow's summit. The city promises quite a party as leaders from Japan, China, South Korea, Australia, the U.S. and others begin talks for the largest free-trade treaty in history.
REPORTER =>  The one sour note is North Korea, the only Pacific Rim country not participating. There are rumors of secret meetings with North Korean representatives, but U.S. officials insist the North must first hold democratic elections, and halt its nuclear weapons program -- as they claimed to have done back in 1995.
REPORTER =>  Tensions remain high since last year's skirmishes between North Korea and the U.S. So any chance of the communist North joining the Pacific Partners seems highly unlikely.
Consulate => of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
SAM => I can't stand it -- half an hour to get to the stupid school every morning... with no music...  [Just our damn Nanny...]
DRIVER =>  [Stay in the car.]
CARSON => Son of a bitch!
MIRANDA => Pete... please... we have to be up early tomorrow. Call the police.
CARSON => Yeah, right.
CARSON =>  Shit!
MIRANDA => Not again...
WESTEC GUARD => Everybody... chill! Bikini boy! On the ground!
CARSON => Asshole was trying to boost my car!
CARSON => Mike -- call 911!
NEIGHBOR => Been trying...  It's busy.  He's the good guy, you schumcks.
CARSON => I hate this fuckin' town.
JOY => There are six bathrooms in this house, Sam.
SAM =>  But only one with a smoking section.
AMBASSADOR HAN =>  [Go change.]
AMBASSADOR HAN =>  [You smell like a fireplace.]
MRS. HAN => It's the Governess...  Hello, Hilda...
GOVERNESS =>  Mrs. Han... I am very sick today...
MRS. HAN =>  We will see you next week...  It appears I'll be taking you to school.
JAVAL => Very good. You may go now...
BOBBI =>  ...Good morning, Summit Day! It's gonna be the Super Bowl, the 4th of July, the Olympics and Woodstock all rolled into one! All over town there'll be parades, concerts, rallies, festivals... So get out there everyone, but plan your drive- time accordingly! This is Bobbi Marchfelder, your Eye in the Sky...
MORNING ANCHOR =>  The President is on his way...
PRESIDENT =>  ...It's an honor hosting my fellow leaders in Los Angeles, the capitol city of the Pacific Rim...
MORNING ANCHOR =>  We'll see the menu for Mayor Simpson's Brentwood barbecue, right after this...
MIRANDA => I was watching that.
CARSON => If I hear one more Beach Boys song, I'll shoot myself.
CARSON =>  I said, if we were having sex once in a while, you wouldn't need to ride that fucking bike every morning.
MIRANDA =>  Be right with you...
MIRANDA =>  Have you gotten any sleep lately?
CARSON =>  Shop's gonna tow the car in -- goddamn ignition's trashed.
MIRANDA => Take mine. I'll ride in with Diane.
CARSON => You ask me, those suckers are a lost cause.
MIRANDA => It's not for you.
CARSON => You mean it's not for you.
MIRANDA => I don't chase car thieves in my underwear. C'mon, you'd die of boredom if we ever sold this house and moved.
CARSON => I'd die of shock, from finding anyone dumb enough to buy the place. Even for what it's worth now.
MIRANDA => Lots of people bought at the top of the market...
CARSON => That sure cheers me right up.
MIRANDA => I don't know why we even talk about it. The city's not the problem. So we move. It wouldn't matter. What's that saying: "Wherever you go, there you are."
MIRANDA =>  I hope you're current on your tetanus booster. Was it worth it?
CARSON => One cut... two assholes in the hospital... Yep.
CARSON =>  Well, another day of baby-sitting my favorite bunch of people...
MIRANDA => Ask for a transfer.
CARSON => They're not gonna transfer me. You know damn well why I was bumped down to guard duty...  My outstanding people skills.
CARSON => I hate this fuckin' town.
ANGRY VOICE => Goddamn Limey overpriced piece a shit...
JOY => Can we give Lisa a ride?
LISA => Hey, Joy... Sam...
LISA =>  Excellent -- I can't hear him!
SAM =>  The glass is an inch thick.  Armor-plated. Bulletproof. Bomb- proof.
LISA => Perfect car for L.A.  Starts, too.
ROBBINS => Yo, Dave the Computer Man! Actually escaped the office!
DAVE => I'm doin' field upgrades. Gives 'em a chance to hose out my cage.
DAVE =>  Who's the fuckin' gargoyle?
ROBBINS => Their Chief of Security, Colonel Lee.
SABATINI => "Chuckles," as we're inclined to call him.  Friggin' graveyard shift...
ROBBINS => Love to know what dope made it the Bureau's job to give full-time protection to foreign consulates.  Cup a mud?
DAVE => Not if you made it. Why don't you get Sabatini to brew the java? She's the alleged chick.
SABATINI => Blow me.
DAVE => Where's Carson?
SABATINI => On his way. Some creeps tried to rip off his Mustang last night.  They cut the ragtop.
DAVE => Motherfuckers...
DAVE =>  Latest and greatest. Wireless network link-ups.
SABATINI => Whoa, slow down, I'm gonna pee.
ROBBINS => Me, too.
DAVE => Ingrates.
JAVAL => You see that I'm serious in my intention, yes?  If you cooperate, you and your children will be home for dinner tonight.
COLONEL LEE =>  [You must stay here.]
AMBASSADOR HAN => Someone took my family!
SABATINI => You got no jurisdiction outside this property!
SABATINI =>  Shit!  Yank his fuckin' leash!
AMBASSADOR HAN => My men are going!
AMBASSADOR HAN =>  It's a white telephone van, driving west on Washington Boulevard.
ROBBINS => Keys!
SABATINI => You're ridin' shotgun.
ROBBINS => Cherry?
DAVE => Under the seat.
ROBBINS => Siren?
DAVE => I don't know! I'm never in a fuckin' hurry..!
SABATINI => Someone snatched Han's family! White phone van, westbound on Washington!
CARSON => Give me a secure radio!
CO-WORKER => Someone's been to Nordstroms, big time.
WALTHER => Clothes make the man.
CO-WORKER => But does the man make enough for the clothes?
WALTHER =>  The man makes payments on his Visa.
SECRETARY => Mr. Walther... priority line!
WALTHER =>  This is Diplomatic Liaison Earl Walther... What's the nature of your emer --  Aw, Jesus... not today...  I'll inform channels and get a copter in the air. For God's sake, keep it quiet. Do what you can, but don't endanger civilians or the family!
CARSON =>  You bet -- nice and easy.
WALTHER =>  Get the Secretary of State on the horn.  I know he left already. I'm familiar with the concept of time zones. Find his ass.
CARSON =>  Robbins, Sabatini... Chopper's on its way.
CARSON =>  Check it out! Ahead, on the right!
SABATINI =>  Think it's them?
CARSON =>  Yeah... but it seems too easy... I'll move up; he won't suspect a civilian car. Stay back, then get on his ass when I signal. We'll box him in.
CARSON =>  If the Mod Squad gets in your way, don't be shy about getting 'em out.
SABATINI =>  Copy that one.
SABATINI => Don't puke... I hate when guys puke!
JAVAL => I need to concentrate!
CARSON =>  He's gonna wrap it around something!
CARSON => Oh, shit...
COLONEL LEE => You should not have interfered!
CARSON => I'm in no mood...
ROBBINS => Forget about him!
CARSON => Let's get back to the Consulate.
JAVAL => Does anyone need to use the rest room? This will be your last opportunity for a few hours.  Very well. Mrs. Han, Sam, Joy, please sit here. (indicates the Lazy Boys; then turns to Lisa) And you... what is your name?
LISA =>  Lisa...
JAVAL => No, Mrs. Han, this one. Thank you.
JAVAL =>  You afford me some additional bargaining power. But not much.
JAVAL =>  There. No taping your mouths, no restraints. Please remain still while I explain. The meters on the left indicate sound pressure -- Decibels. There are microphones on your chair backs. If you raise your voices above certain level, putting your meter in the red zone for more than one sustained second, the circuit will be closed.  The right meters indicate motion. There are pressure sensors inside the armrests and seats. The sensors don't like to get wet, so I hope you were honest about not needing to use the loo. If you make any excess movements, or try to leave your chair, the circuit will be closed.
MRS. HAN => I don't understand...
MRS. HAN =>  What happens if the circuit closes?
JAVAL => Kaboom...
JAVAL =>  Easy... deep breath...  Do each of you understand?
JAVAL =>  Keep your wits, and all will be fine.
COMMENTATOR #1 =>  ...Not since the '84 Olympics has the whole city had an such an opportunity --
WALTHER => Carson?  Walther. Who told the Ambassador?
CARSON => His Security Chief.  There was a civilian with them -- fifteen-year-old girl from across the street. We're trying to reach the parents.
WALTHER => Goddamn it...  Look, Mrs. Han was the North Korean Premier's niece! We're hearing rumors they're gonna make a major issue out of what happened here...
CARSON => I'm not so sure what happened here. Something smells. Asshole was acting like he wanted us to spot him...
WALTHER => What the hell are you talking about?
AMBASSADOR HAN => Mr. Walther?
WALTHER => Ambassador Han... my deepest --
AMBASSADOR HAN => -- I have no wish for condolences. Just answers.
WALTHER => As soon as we have any to give...
AMBASSADOR HAN =>  Yoon..?!
CARSON =>  Start a trace!
WALTHER =>  Mr. Secretary... they're alive!
COLONEL LEE =>  You are tapping our phones?!
CARSON =>  Yeah, you didn't know. And I'm Meryl Streep.
MRS. HAN =>  We are not hurt. But this man is very serious --
JAVAL =>  I want you to remember the feeling you had when you thought your family was dead, and use it to inform the choices you're about to make.
CARSON => Say you want to talk to the kids...
AMBASSADOR HAN =>  I need to know my children are all right.
JAVAL =>  Be in front of a television in two minutes. Tune it to channel four. You'll get the picture.
AMBASSADOR HAN => There is a television in my office.
ROBBINS =>  We're screwed on the trace -- he's on a cell phone.
DAVE => Play the tape back. I might be able to pull the electronic serial number out of the subcarrier.
CARSON =>  Ask Dave if he knows how to find the phone's serial number.
ROBBINS =>  Hey, great idea...
CARSON => Oh, Jesus, those're explosives!  Look at the TV -- this was just taken.
JAVAL =>  There must surely be several people in the room; you may put me on the speakerbox if you wish.
JAVAL =>  I am not a terrorist. Your countries' political posturing means nothing to me. So do not waste time trying to negotiate.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Los Angeles can furnish ten million dollars U.S. by 2:00 PM. The required denominations are in the instructions, as is the method of packaging. Be in your car at 3:00 PM, and drive north on Highland Avenue. I will call with where to leave the money, which you will do at 3:30. If I am unmolested, I will call again at 4:00 with the family's location and the method for removing them from their... predicament. Could you please refer to page one?  Any deviation from these instructions and my device will fulfill its function at exactly 5:00 PM.
AMBASSADOR HAN =>  P'yngyang must approve the ransom...
WALTHER => Of course. The FBI's top Hostage Negotiator is on the way --
CARSON => -- Goddamn Negotiator's the last thing we need! This asshole sound like he was interested in bargaining?
WALTHER => We have people who are experts in these situations. We really feel it would be best if you let them coordinate everything...
WALTHER =>  Let's get on it...
CARSON => ...You're gonna just pay up, count on his good nature to return the family?!
WALTHER => It's the President's intention to keep this quiet, move forward with the Summit, and work with the North Koreans. Jesus, you've already embarrassed the shit out of us over the phone surveillance --
CARSON => -- They know their phones are tapped! They tap our fucking phones!
WALTHER => That's not the point! The point is not acknowledging it!  We got an international incident brewing, with a country we were practically at war with last year! Our best Negotiator is gonna run point. If you got a problem, you can take the goddamn rest of the day off.
CARSON => This Consulate is my responsibility.
WALTHER => Not any more.
WALTHER =>  That's the Negotiator. You do the briefing.
CARSON => ...Our worst enemy'll be the city. There are events gearing up all around town, and a dozen world leaders arriving. Add the Friday rush hour and usual L.A. bad behavior and it'll be a nightmare out there by 3 PM. It all works to the advantage of the kidnapper, hinders our pursuit efforts...  You don't agree?
MIRANDA => I'm wondering whether to believe him when he says he's strictly motivated by money.
CARSON =>  You see one word of Peoples'- Liberation, Holy-Jihad, Revolutionary whatever-it-is-we're-pissed-off-about- this-week bullshit in this entire letter?
MIRANDA => I still want to check the MO against known politicals, terrorists --
CARSON => -- Already doing it. We're coordinating with the Secret Service, the NSA and the CIA.
MIRANDA => Have someone talk to the LAPD, give them a cover story for the media about the crash on La Cienega.
WALTHER => Why didn't you tell me Doctor Knoll is your wife?!
CARSON =>  If she'd changed her name when we got married, I wouldn't have to.
MIRANDA =>  I'm so enjoying this opportunity to finally work together...
WALTHER => Jesus, forget I asked.  The cash will be here in an hour.  Any thoughts on the kidnapper's thoughts?
MIRANDA => Everything indicates he's working alone. And his concerns do seem to be solely about the money... so I agree that he's only using the Summit and the tension with North Korea to create extreme motivation to pay the ransom.
COLONEL LEE => I will bring the money to him.
CARSON => My ass.
COLONEL LEE => The hostages are citizens of the People's Republic of Korea --
CARSON => -- Hey, do I go to the torture chambers in your prisons, tell you how to do your job?
WALTHER => All right, you're outta here! Is this the same insubordinate crap you pulled at Beverly Thrift?
CARSON => I'll coordinate the drop.
AMBASSADOR HAN => Perhaps that is better. Inspector Carson knows the terrain --
COLONEL LEE => -- Then he can come with me.
WALTHER =>  It's settled.
CARSON => It sucks.
MIRANDA => But it means we can get on with it.
MIRANDA =>  Get one thing straight, Mr. Walther. If the Bureau had listened to Pete, Beverly Thrift never would've happened.
JAVAL => That's more like it...
OPERATIVE =>  ...They've got the Premier agreeing to the hard-line position --
OPERATIVE =>  More to follow...
DAVE => I wanted to be home by now, take the kids to the rally in Boyle Heights.
SABATINI => We got a cabin in Big Bear. By now, L.A. was supposed to be a brown blotch in the rear-view mirror.
MIRANDA => He'll expect a homing device --
CARSON => -- I expect him to expect it. He'll check the cash with an RF detector...  Meaning he'll find this one.  This only has a quarter-mile range, but on a frequency too low to detect.  And I doubt the asshole will have an X-ray machine or a metal detector.
MIRANDA => Why must you always refer generically to criminals as "assholes?"
CARSON => Gosh, you're right. It could undermine their self-esteem and spoil their chances for rehabilitation.
MIRANDA => You been reading my magazines in the bathroom again?
JAVAL =>  "And my device will fulfill its function at exactly 5:00 PM..."
MIRANDA => He's really exhibiting pressured speech... big effort here to sound calm. Same with his vocabulary... if he were in control, he wouldn't feel such a need to sound that way.
CARSON => Just tell me if we can use it.
MIRANDA => If we needle him he could get sloppy and give us an opening, but I'm not going to risk it. This is the worst kind of perpetrator: anything makes him deviate from his carefully- scripted plan, he could become extremely volatile.
MIRANDA =>  Do we have back-up if the bleeper fails?
CARSON =>  Nothing but physical surveillance.
MIRANDA => It's real important we don't lose him. He didn't go through all the trouble of designing that bomb not to use it.
CARSON => Well, it ain't gonna happen.  Not again...
PRESIDENT =>  What the hell is the big crisis?
PRESIDENT =>  Bullshit. They're just ticked because we don't want the Chinese dragging their asses into the treaty talks.
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER => We have a covert operative in place. He reports the hard-liners and moderates in the High Command are arguing about how to respond, should the Premier's niece and her children should be killed.
PRESIDENT =>  Respond?! Christ. What about the damn Premier?
CIA CHIEF => Which is a real possibility. Most of those old-fart Generals don't want to -more-
CIA CHIEF => be part of the Summit any more than we want them to. They're mad as hell he even talked to the Chinese.
PRESIDENT =>  I don't want to deal with this right now! Get our diplomats on it. Tell the North we'll pay the ransom for 'em... Placate 'em! And make damn sure we get that family back in one piece. Who's in charge in L.A.?
FBI CHIEF => The Bureau, Sir. We have a crack team in place.
CIA CHIEF =>  What about your man stationed at the Consulate...  Carson? He was demoted from the FBI Hostage Program, couple years back. And this did happen on his watch...
FBI CHIEF =>  There's no way he could've prevented this abduction! Besides, I've got one of my top Negotiators in charge --
PRESIDENT =>  -- Whatever. I want a total news blackout and I want this over with, quickly! Without giving those Commie little bastards any excuse to shit all over my Summit!
MIRANDA =>  Yes, please go ahead...
JAVAL =>  Ah... this must be one of those professionals --
MIRANDA =>  -- I'm only here to see that everyone gets what they want --
JAVAL =>  -- I've got my shotgun in little Lisa's mouth, and I will pull the trigger in five seconds unless you put the Ambassador on the phone.
MIRANDA =>  The drop is at the DeMille barn, across from the Hollywood Bowl. You're to leave the money in the center of the parking lot.
CARSON =>  Shit... no way we can set up a stake- out in... -more-
CARSON =>  Four minutes. Call the Park Rangers at the Bowl. Have them clear the area of civilians.
MIRANDA =>  Remember, Pete... we're dealing with a customer with a lot of rage.
CARSON =>  Must've bought a house same time we did.
CARSON =>  There's about a hundred ways he can scurry off like a cockroach from here... So spread out.
DAVE =>  Our boy's in a fuckin' ice cream truck!
DAVE => Son of a bitch!  He found the bleepers -- both of them!
CARSON =>  Fuck! Okay, stay back. It's not like he'll be hard to see in that truck. Which way's he heading?
DAVE =>  Toward the freeway.
MIRANDA =>  What happened?
CARSON =>  We're made! Gotta grab him!
MIRANDA =>  All right... Carefully...
CARSON => Watch it! We need him alive!
COLONEL LEE => Turn around!
CARSON => FBI. Call our office, they'll take care of you.
BIKER => I'm a taxpayer! I'm a goddamn dentist!
CARSON => Just don't kill yourself, you piece of shit...
CARSON =>  Helicopter or two would be nice!
MIRANDA =>  Love to be in the loop on this...
CARSON =>  Not just now, dear...
CARSON =>  I coulda had a ranch... maybe some horses... but no, we moved to L.A.
CARSON =>  He's on foot, at the base of the elevator tower!
CARSON =>  Goddammit! He's in a blue Geo!
CARSON => Fingerprint it.  He's not gonna tell us where to find the hostages... -more-
CARSON =>  Meaning we got exactly 80 minutes to figure it out for ourselves.
WALTHER => Figure it out?! With what?!
CARSON =>  Miranda! We need a copter, pronto!  Get back to his van. There were no plates, but check the VIN, look it over, then meet us at the Consulate.
CARSON =>  Go!
CARSON =>  ...Scrounge us some bodies: National Guard, State Troopers, CHPs, local PD's, meter maids --
WALTHER => -- They're gonna search the whole city in a goddamn hour..?!
CARSON => Look, I don't need you to tell me how fucked we are!
WALTHER => Fuck you!! Every time you're on a case something explodes!
MIRANDA => Stop! The clock's running! Arguing is a luxury we can't afford! -more-
MIRANDA =>  What's done is done. There'll be plenty of time to point fingers later.
SABATINI => I need some fuckin' ink!!
AMBASSADOR HAN => This is impossible! How can you even begin to find them?
MIRANDA => Well, the normal procedure is to negotiate with the perpetrator...
CARSON => Let's take stock. We've got a picture of where he hid the family, and recordings of his calls --
MIRANDA => -- That's right! We can send them to our experts for analysis...
CARSON =>  Same with his fingerprints. But that means we need high-quality image and data transmission. We can piss away ten minutes coptering this shit to our offices in Westwood, or we can use your surveillance equipment.
COLONEL LEE => There is no surveillance equipment. This is a diplomatic facility --
CARSON => -- You want to play games, fine.
AMBASSADOR HAN => Take them upstairs.
CARSON => South Korean Consulate's just down the street -- want to take a listen?
CARSON =>  Shitcan that thing, will you?!
CARSON =>  Got a digital scanner?
COLONEL LEE => Analog.
CARSON =>  You might want to drop a few bucks at Radio Shack and get with the decade.  Dave -- get in here. Bring your computer, a city map, and the tapes of the ransom calls.
DAVE =>  On my way...
MIRANDA =>  Colonel, you saw the perp. Describe him to the Ambassador, see if it's anyone he knows.
CARSON =>  This is Carson in L.A. There's a set of prints coming over. Narrow the search criteria: Male, thirties, Caucasian... French, Belgian, Swiss, maybe Canadian. Try kidnappers and bombers first. We need an answer in fifteen minutes.
FINGERPRINT TECH =>  That yellow air out there finally rot your brain?! It's impossible!
CARSON =>  Dazzle me.
CARSON =>  We got one of the best sound guys right here in town...  Newman in Audio Analysis...
DAVE => Newman's gone.
DAVE => He quit, couple weeks ago. Opened a bed and breakfast in Wyoming.
DAVE =>  Damn... they get HBO? I'd sure like to see the fight tonight.
CARSON => Get those tapes transferred to a sound guy. We need ambient and background analysis, the whole enchilada.
DAVE => Enchilada -- you saying that because I'm Mexican?
CARSON => No... 'cause you're fat.
MIRANDA =>  Photo enhancement... Isn't there some amazing tech with the LAPD --
DAVE => -- Bronsky. Transferred to Seattle PD a month ago.
CARSON => Jesus H. Christ...
SABATINI => I'd send it to Langley. Let the CIA earn their keep.
CARSON => Do it.
MIRANDA => Given his behavior, this orange residue... I'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg. Amphetamines.
CARSON => Any significance?
MIRANDA => It's consistent with the lone wolf scenario: A handful of these is pure bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the psychosis and paranoia kick in.  We could check pharmacy records, on the remote chance he got them legally... if we had a couple of weeks, that is.
CARSON =>  Get the Bureau on it.
MIRANDA => Forget it. It's a waste of manpower.
CARSON => Look, goddammit, you start skipping no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all quit and go to the beach right now.
CARSON =>  He grabbed the family at 8:30. The last certain visual we had was just before his van went into the alley on La Cienega at 8:42. He called the Consulate at 9:30.
MIRANDA => That gives him about fifty minutes to get to his location, move and secure the hostages, and activate his time bomb.
CARSON => He probably waited a while to pad the time -- he wanted us know the family was still alive...  ...So these crazy bastards wouldn't throw a premature shit hemorrhage, but he didn't want to call too soon, either. I say they're within 15 to 20 minutes, via surface streets, of where we last saw them.
MIRANDA => The most densely-populated part of the L.A. basin. This narrows it down to about 200,000 dwellings.
MIRANDA =>  He was traveling west --
CARSON => -- Bet he doubled back.
MIRANDA => C'mon, that's total conjecture --
SABATINI =>  -- I'd trust his instincts when dealing with maniacs. He is deeply disturbed.
MIRANDA => You're telling me?
PRESIDENT =>  Meaning?
PRESIDENT =>  Are they out of their fuckin' minds?! What kind of retaliation?
CIA CHIEF => They're threatening to pull a Saddam Hussein: remember the Scuds he lobbed at Jerusalem during Desert Storm?  They're talking about firing a missile into Los Angeles --
PRESIDENT =>  -- A goddamn WHAT??
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER => Best guess is an AS-15, medium-range cruise -- their version of our Tomahawk, launched from offshore.
VICE PRESIDENT => Still, for their purposes it's perfect: Hit somewhere in L.A., take out a city block or two...
PRESIDENT =>  I don't believe I'm hearing this!  So if we know it's coming, we can knock it out of the fuckin' sky!
PRESIDENT =>  -- You're saying we got all this lousy hardware and can't stop one goddamn missile??
PRESIDENT =>  I want an immediate search for all ships within range.
FBI CHIEF => We better inform the other leaders, stall on the Summit --
PRESIDENT =>  There's no reason to panic yet -- they can't launch until after the family's confirmed dead!
CIA CHIEF => Afraid that's not the case...
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER => The North Korean Premier holds what we call a "Brinksman Switch." He's able to destroy a missile in flight, right up to the moment before it achieves its target.
CIA CHIEF => Our Op says they've timed their retaliation to hit right after 5:00.
FBI CHIEF => And if the family turns up okay, they'll just make it self-destruct.
PRESIDENT =>  Shit! I really don't need this today!
VICE PRESIDENT => We're forgetting one thing here: the family. Intelligence is sure the North will abort their attack if Mrs. Han and her kids are safely returned?
CIA CHIEF => Absolutely. Their whole game depends on claiming a legitimate provocation.
PRESIDENT =>  I'd like to turn 'em into a radioactive parking lot.
PRESIDENT =>  Believe me, the North drops one in my fuckin' city, I'm dropping ten in theirs. Get some bombers in the air. And don't tell me any more bad news!
ROBBINS =>  ...Phone company decal's a fake. DMV says the van was purchased a week ago from a private party in Santa Monica. I called 'em; they said the guy paid cash, and he fits our boy's description. Signed the name "Douglas McArthur" to the Transfer of Title.
CARSON =>  Cute.  He signed the name of the Allied Commander during the Korean War. Maybe he was a political.
MIRANDA => No. The phony ice cream truck, the booby-trapped chairs... he could've -more-
MIRANDA => done it without half that stuff. But this was going to be the score of a lifetime... he was showing off.
CARSON =>  Who's got those kinds of skills: Electronics, vehicle customizing, computers, explosives?
DAVE => Military. Cop, maybe. Shit, your average high-school student if they're so inclined. My guess is our perp used off-the-shelf equipment for everything except the C-4, and that's only slightly harder to get than crack or heroin, if you know who to ask.
BOBBI => Please, L.A., I know we're about to have quite a party out there, but don't forget the Golden Rule on the roadways... News time is 3:59...
BOBBI => This is Bobbi Marchfelder, your Eye in the Sky... back to you, Brent...
BOBBI =>  Hey, dickhead... I was backlit that entire segment!  Keep... the sun... to my left!!
BOBBI =>  What's new on the kidnapping rumor?
CAMERAMAN => Nada. Total news blackout.
BOBBI => Go back over the hill.
NEWS PILOT => We got the valley traffic report in fifteen --
BOBBI => -- "Stalled vehicle! One lane closed! Sig alert..!" I'll improvise!
BOBBI =>  What are you lookin' at? I was the morning anchor in Houston! And I'm one break away from getting out of this stupid fuckin' whirlybird!
JOY => Why us?
MRS. HAN => You heard him -- for money.
JOY => What if something goes wrong?
MRS. HAN =>  It won't.
CARSON => I'm going to the kidnapping site.
MIRANDA => I want to talk to the witnesses.
CARSON => Great, we'll hire a bus.
DAVE =>  ...I know it's privileged information, goddammit! Lemme talk to a supervisor... You are a supervisor... Lemme talk to your goddamn supervisor... I told you, I'm with the FBI...  Cellular company says he was using a phone with a cloned number.
SABATINI => Big surprise. Have 'em send a list of the numbers called on the account.
DAVE => That's what I'm trying to get. They're saying I need a subpoena.  Don't put me on hold... Don't...  I'm listening to Michael fuckin' Bolton!
SABATINI => Walther! Get on the horn to Justice and deal with this!
ROBBINS =>  A lot of the components are made by the same manufacturer -- a car security company.
CARSON =>  Jump a copter to the Consulate. See if the manufacturer sells to the public. Find out what shops use their stuff; put people on the phones with a description of the perp.
YOUNG COP => Inspector! Look at this...  "Dragon's Breath..?"
CARSON => Twelve-gauge shell filled with magnesium and ignition powder. Shit's worse than napalm -- Geneva Convention outlawed it for warfare.
MIRANDA => Then how did he get it?
CARSON => Easy -- you can buy 'em mail order.  Where's the Consulate's car?
YOUNG COP =>  Uh... apparently it was stolen...
COLONEL LEE => Stolen!? What is it with you people --
YOUNG COP =>  -- What's this "you people" shit?
CARSON =>  Shut up!
MIRANDA =>  He means all of us "you people."
CARSON =>  Find it! How many bulletproof Mercedes could be cruising around Crenshaw?
YOUNG COP => You'd be surprised...
CARSON => I hate this fuckin' town.
CARSON => Wasted trip: Witnesses say he was working alone, and he was a vicious son of a bitch. Old news.
COLONEL LEE =>  And our car was stolen.
AMBASSADOR HAN => I felt safer when I was the Ambassador to Libya.
SABATINI => Image enhancements came back.
CARSON => We going steady?
SABATINI => The sun position tells us the windows are facing northeast.  Here's the best -- look at the glass on the prints hanging in the background. There's a reflection of a reflection, out on the street: the corner of a billboard.
CARSON => Looks like the wheel of a car.
MIRANDA => We talked about these billboards, when we were car shopping! Four- door... they make a wagon, too.  Something Japanese... God, what was it? Toyota... Mazda... Honda... You thought it had no character.
CARSON => I thought that about all of them. C'mon, think, dammit!!
MIRANDA => You think!! You were there, too!
CARSON => Call the outdoor advertising companies. Get the location of all the billboards for Japanese cars within our search parameters.
DAVE =>  ...Peerless Auto Security. We need to know whether you've sold a large quantity of these components to any one customer, or whether you'd had any stolen recently...
OPERATIVE =>  ...Missile heading to L.A. has a Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is Kipchak equipped! It was switched by order of --
MRS. HAN => He asked you if you had to go...
JOY => Oh, my God...
PRESIDENT =>  So what the hell does "Kipchak" mean?
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER => Uh, it's a code name... for weapons using the Yersinia Pestis bacillus...
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER =>  Kipchaks were Asian nomads. In 1347 they attacked a Genoese fort, and catapulted infected corpses over the walls. The Genoese who survived carried the disease back to Europe... and it killed half the population.
PRESIDENT =>  Get to the goddamn point, Major.
CIA CHIEF => Seems the missile is armed with a warhead carrying the Pneumonic Plague.
PRESIDENT =>  The Black Plague?! Every time I talk to you fuckin' guys it gets worse! What happened to this "limited retaliation" shit?
CIA CHIEF => We think one of the Hard-liners switched the warhead without the Premier's knowledge. But he's not about to take our word for it, and he's too weak to risk the humiliation of backing down.
PRESIDENT =>  They use a biological weapon on American soil, they have to know we'll respond!
PRESIDENT =>  What the hell are we doing in L.A.?
PRESIDENT =>  All right. Assuming the worst... What'll happen?
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER => The warhead vents the plague bacteria above the target area, infecting about 50,000 people. First symptoms are vomiting, lymph nodes become swollen; temperature rises to 105. Victims turn deep purple from lung hemorrhaging, usually die the same day.  There are treatments -- streptomycin and tetracyclines -- but we'd be overwhelmed by the numbers and its extreme contagiousness.
CIA CHIEF => We could have 500,000 infected in a week, who knows how many after that.
PRESIDENT =>  I'm gonna toast those fuckers! Have the Summit leaders been warned?
FBI CHIEF => Yes, sir... no one's landing in L.A. 'til we give the all-clear.
PRESIDENT =>  And you're sure it's safe if we can get 'em to destroy the missile in flight?
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER => The bacteria can't survive the heat of an explosion.
CIA CHIEF => I suggest none of this go any further -- not even to the agents working to find the family. Word leaks out to a city of 12 million people there's rocket full of the Plague coming at 'em, you'll create a panic of biblical proportions.
CARSON => Say what?
COLONEL LEE => Perhaps someone will decide it is foolish to incur the wrath of North Korea.
CARSON =>  Yeah, the U.S. is behind the whole thing. And we're knocking our heads, trying to find your people, just for show.
WALTHER => Carson...
CARSON => Let's grab a few beers, kick back 'til five o'clock rolls by. Then maybe we can have a war over it. I think that's a great idea, seeing as how you fuckers have needed your clocks cleaned for fifty years now!
COLONEL LEE =>  Why wait until five?
MIRANDA => Pete!  Christ, you're self-indulgent! There's nothing but anger and cynicism left inside you, so they're all you can express any more. No wonder everyone in the Bureau thinks you're such a nutcase!
CARSON => Hey, I'm not the only one with a rep around the office... "Dr. Knoll-It- All."
MIRANDA =>  You've been dying to tell me that...
CARSON => Miranda...  Shit.
ROBBINS =>  ...Yeah, Peerless Auto Security... fine... get your manager...
INSTALLER #1 =>  Tell Jerry, pick up line one!
INSTALLER #2 => Jerry's outta here!
INSTALLER #1 => Some cop's asking if we sold a bunch of Peerless parts.
INSTALLER #2 => Talk to Javal!
INSTALLER #1 => Javal's off today.
INSTALLER #3 => Dude's off a lot.
INSTALLER #4 =>  He's used to it -- fuckin' Frenchies get the whole summer off.
INSTALLER #2 =>  Man's Canadian, dickweeds!
INSTALLER #1 =>  You're gonna have to call back on Monday...
CARSON => Everyone shut up!  Guy on vacation, the Canadian --
INSTALLER #1 =>  -- Yeah, Javal...
CARSON =>  Six foot, sandy hair, spooky eyes?
INSTALLER #1 =>  Zombie Eyes! You know the man?
CARSON =>  I need a full name, address, anything you got!
INSTALLER #1 =>  Paul Javal... hang on, we'll look it up... This an immigration thing? Shit, he's our best installer.
ESPIONAGE AGENT => Inspector Carson, extension 666...
CARSON => That's appropriate...  In 30 seconds you're gonna give me Paul Javal's shoe size.
CARSON =>  Carson...
EDWARDS => Edwards, Sound Lab...
CARSON =>  Whatta you got?
EDWARDS =>  Ambient background sound is normal city stuff, but there's a distinct echo pattern. Your people are in or near a high-rise that's at least eight floors tall. And there are other high-rises nearby.
CARSON =>  How high up are they?
EDWARDS =>  No way to extrapolate that from the sample you gave us.  One more thing: There's an emergency siren approaching at 17 seconds into the second call, passing the location at 33.5 seconds.
CARSON => Okay -- high-rises in our search area. Eight stories or higher.
MIRANDA => Downtown, Century City, Westwood corridor, Museum Row, Mid- Wilshire... North of Sunset Strip there's a few...
CARSON => Sabatini! What about that billboard?
SABATINI => Nothing yet! Everyone's left their goddamn offices already!
CARSON =>  LAPD will have a record of all emergency vehicles running Code 3 at 9:32 AM. Get their starting point and their destination.
MIRANDA => And have them narrow their foot- searches to areas around high-rises.
CARSON =>  Where's that fuckin' address?!
DAVE => I'm still holdin'!
DAVE =>  He's on our hit parade. Interpol passed us his records when he entered the country.  French by birth... looks like a total scumbag.
SABATINI => Isn't that redundant?
DAVE =>  Raised in Quebec. Moved to Europe; served some short stretches, petty shit... arrested for kidnapping, no conviction. Did four years in France for blowing bank vaults. Moved to U.S. last year. Clean since then.
CARSON => Get his Driver's License number; Social; bank accounts; charge cards; club memberships... find out what movies he rented.  Get whoever's closest to the Auto Shop to get in there, interview everybody.
MIRANDA => This sure was a ballsy move for a car-alarm installer.
CARSON => Hey, he watched the news... Everyone knows the U.S. will do anything to avoid trouble with a mad-dog country.
MIRANDA => Ambassador --
CARSON => -- Quit apologizing for me!
MIRANDA => Quit giving me reasons to!
AMBASSADOR HAN =>  On occasion, my wife has been known to kick my ankle under the table.
CARSON => Sounds like her aim's a little low.
DAVE => Address, according to the Auto Shop.
CARSON =>  Apartment 1060! He's in a high-rise! Sabatini -- you're with us. (off Robbins' disappointed look) She's got the field experience.
MIRANDA => There still could be accomplices. If there are, they'll hear us in the helicopter.
CARSON => There's a TV station a couple blocks away. We'll land on their pad.  K-EYE. Clear it with 'em. Have a SWAT team assemble, but tell 'em to hang back unless we need 'em.
OPERATIVE =>  ...Missile heading to L.A. has a Kipchak Warhead! Repeat: missile is Kipchak equipped!
CARSON => Oh, great, the media...  It's the goddamn traffic girl!
MIRANDA => Traffic person.
BOBBI => Where are you going?
CARSON => We can't get into that right now...
BOBBI => Hey, you expect to use my station's facilities and not even tell us --
MIRANDA =>  Sorry...
BOBBI =>  What the fuck are you, the Barbie Corporate Ass-Lick model?
MIRANDA => Guess what, Sister... you're about to spend the next five years in a penitentiary for interfering with a federal investigation.
STATION MANAGER => Bobbi! I promised we'd respect their news blackout!
BOBBI =>  Figures... you dickless wonder.
STATION MANAGER => I get an exclusive later, right?
CARSON => This works out, I'll play the fuckin' banjo for you.
CARSON => We're hoofing it.
SABATINI =>  'She's got the field experience'... To park the fuckin' car!
CARSON =>  Whoa... FBI..!
CARSON =>  How the hell you get here so fast?
CARSON => Terrific. Who else is here?
CARSON => Tell 'em to be cool. We're going up.  Give me your master key.
WOMAN => What the fuck..!
MIRANDA => Sorry...
CARSON =>  Wait here.
CARSON =>  I'm in. It's empty, but sit tight while I look around.
MIRANDA => I like what you've done with the place...
COLONEL LEE => Wait!
SABATINI => Where's Carson?
COLONEL LEE => Inside.
CARSON => NO! --
CARSON => I said keep everyone back!!
MIRANDA => Stop it!
CARSON =>  Get out of my sight.
BOBBI =>  Marchfelder.
STATION MANAGER =>  You dated the Mayor, right?
BOBBI =>  You need a traffic ticket fixed?
STATION MANAGER =>  Try to confirm something for us. There's an incredible buzz on the Internet -- someone picked up a classified message on a U.S. Intelligence frequency. We think it's authentic!
CARSON =>  What's the status?
ROBBINS =>  Wilshire and West PD Divisions had seven vehicles running with sirens at 9:32. They're getting the routes from the officers now.
CARSON =>  Hurry it the hell up.
CARSON =>  I should've known she'd come up.
MIRANDA => Pete --
CARSON => -- "Should've." Shit, there's a familiar word.  That day... I was there soon enough. We should've rushed 'em, before they could finish setting up...
MIRANDA => The Bureau never would've let you. They want it by the book: talk them out.
CARSON => Twelve bodies -- only the hostages.
MIRANDA => You were a greenhorn. It wasn't your decision. You can't keep living as such a raw nerve, never sleeping --
CARSON => -- Those kids were ten years old!  Same age as the Han boy...
CARSON => C'mon! Who's pulling Javal's bank records? What about cross-referencing possible aliases? We got 33 minutes!
MIRANDA => Camry! The billboard! Toyota Camry!  Where are the numbers for the outdoor ad companies?
ROBBINS => Parker Center's making those calls.
BOBBI => Turn the fuckin' camera on! DO IT!!
CAMERAMAN => Maybe it's true... probably is true. That's why they got a news blackout!
BOBBI => I'll rip your miserable eyeballs out! NEWS IS OUR FUCKIN' JOB!!
BOBBI =>  ...A warning was radioed to U.S. Intelligence that a biological weapon, allegedly containing the deadly Pneumonic Plague, is approaching Los Angeles. While unconfirmed, the President and other leaders are all late in arriving...
DAVE => Finally got the call list from Javal's phone. Most aren't his; they're from the legit user who didn't know his number was cloned.
CARSON => Go to the bottom of the list, work back through the last 12 hours.
DAVE => Here's the call to the Consulate -- 965-5000.  The rest are dupes... all from the other guy...
CARSON => Wait... go back... the one at seven this morning...
CARSON => Get down!
CARSON =>  MIRANDA!
MIRANDA => Go..!
CARSON => Get the fuck out of here!
CARSON => Shit, it's like a Godzilla movie out here!
FM NEWSCASTER =>  ...These words, which have terrified the city:
CARSON =>  Miranda..!
MIRANDA =>  I heard. I'm in the copter.
CARSON =>  I want you to get out of here...
MIRANDA =>  Shut up and keep your eyes on the road. That's my goddamn car.  Dave? You staying on top of the research?
DAVE =>  I can't... My kids...
MIRANDA =>  Listen: the best way to help them is to stay at your computer. If any information comes in, holler. Okay?
DAVE =>  Okay...
BOBBI => Don't lose the Benz, moron... pull back... show the other copters around us... this is fuckin' great...
CARSON => ...The Colonel hired Javal, made it look like he was working alone. Then he made sure Javal got killed, so we'd never find your family -- and they'd have an excuse to drop their bomb. But what's in it for 'em?
AMBASSADOR HAN => There are men in my government whose power depends on North Korea staying as it is: Socialist, repressive, isolated from the world. They'll resort to anything, even war, to keep it that way. They have the Hitler Syndrome: if their country cannot exist the way they want it, they would rather see it destroyed.
VREELAND =>  FBI, this is Major Vreeland. Discontinue your pursuit, we're gonna box his ears from up here.
CARSON =>  Negative -- his car's armored! And we need the bastard alive!!
VREELAND =>  We've got the situation in hand.
VREELAND =>  Shit! Pull back!
BOBBI =>  Jesus fuckin' God!!!  Uh, I think we're gonna set down now. Back to you, Brent.
VREELAND =>  Out of the air, or retreat 7,000 meters from target vehicle!
JOY => I always hated that guy...
CARSON => One of yours?  What the hell do you need heat- seeking rockets for in L.A.?
AMBASSADOR HAN => There could be another riot...
CARSON =>  And they call me Mr. Overkill.  Dave, what do you know about...
AMBASSADOR HAN => Strela-2...
CARSON =>  Strela-2 anti-aircraft rockets?
DAVE =>  I'm with ya... Strela-2. Perenosniy zenitniy raketniy kompleks. Russian factory index 9K-32-M2 --
CARSON =>  -- Skip the goddamn trivia! I need range, guidance, arming method, anything we can work with...
MIRANDA =>  -- You don't "work with" rockets, Peter!
MIRANDA =>  Stay back. LAPD's putting up a roadblock.
BOBBI => Save it for someone who gives a shit!
DAVE =>  ...The Strela-2 needs 45 meters to arm, so stay tight on his ass.
CARSON => That Kraut-mobile have any weaknesses you'd like to tell me about?
AMBASSADOR HAN => I don't think so -- they said it was solid as a rock.
CARSON =>  No shit...
AMBASSADOR HAN =>  I can't believe I'm still alive...
CARSON => This were a Hyundai you wouldn't be.
CARSON => Get me out of here...
CARSON =>  Anybody see him?
MIRANDA =>  Still heading north on the 110.
CARSON =>  Dave... You're sure those rockets are heat-seeking?
DAVE =>  Classic IR, reflective optical system. How come?
CARSON =>  Just keep working your leads...
CARSON =>  This is Carson. I need a copter.
CARSON =>  Something small and nimble. Anybody... come in low, from the south... I'm on an ambulance by the 9th Street exit.
MIRANDA =>  Are you out of your mind?
BOBBI => Get this fuckin' thing in the air!  Out! Not enough room for four.
CAMERAMAN =>  What am I supposed to do when the plague comes, hold my breath?
MIRANDA =>  Switch to a secure channel.  What on earth are you thinking?
CARSON =>  I'll make him open the sunroof. Someone can shoot tear gas or a percussion grenade inside.
MIRANDA =>  Pete, you haven't gone... suicidal or anything on me, have you?
CARSON =>  No way. I couldn't stand making so many people happy.
CARSON => You?! I wanted a police copter!
PILOT => Just tell me what to do. I flew two tours in 'Nam.
BOBBI => And he doesn't go unless I go!
CARSON => Wrong-o...
BOBBI => I'm a respected electronic journalist, you fuckin' prick!!
CARSON =>  Got 'im -- looks like he's headed for the 101.
CARSON =>  Pull hard to the left, on my signal...
CARSON => Now!
MIRANDA => You fucking lunatic!!
PILOT => Hope you got more flares than he's got rockets.
MIRANDA => Sorry...
MIRANDA => You're completely deranged! Playing chicken with rockets!
CARSON => Well, what the hell were you doing out there?
AMBASSADOR HAN => What are both of you doing?
CARSON => Oh, for Christ's sake... Hold on!
MIRANDA => Even if we can pry him out with...  Twelve minutes to go, I doubt he'll be very cooperative.
CARSON => I'll just use my outstanding people skills.
CARSON =>  That car's like a rock, right?
MIRANDA => Ever hear of "fuck-me" pumps? Well, these are fuck you pumps!  Where's the family?
DAVE => Holy shit -- Knoll-It-All's turned into Dirty Harriet!
DAVE =>  You're sure there were no accounts in the other names I gave you?
AMBASSADOR HAN => Let him up.
COLONEL LEE => Victory!
CARSON =>  Dave...
CARSON =>  Anything else come through?
DAVE =>  Take a hint. We're screwed.
CARSON =>  Not yet...
DAVE =>  Wait! One of Javal's alias accounts: check for an apartment rental!
CARSON =>  You're shittin'... Where?!
DAVE => Park La Brea!
CARSON =>  ...Have the Manager evacuate the complex. Find out which unit the family's in, but don't let anyone go in 'til we get there.
DAVE =>  Private security's going around with PA's, and they set off the fire alarm.  Well, try callin' him again!  Manager's gone, and the Assistant can't find the key to get to the rental manifest.  Then kick the fuckin' door down!
MILTON =>  I'll try him in his car again...
WESTEC GUARDS =>  Tenants -- leave your apartments at once... Take the stairs...
CARSON => "Fuck-you" pumps??
JOY => They must know we're here...
ALL => Help!
JOY => Mother... Sam...
MRS. HAN => Do it.
MILTON => It's a brown binder... Says "Rental Manifest." You can't miss it...
CARSON =>  Apartment number would be real helpful, gang...
MIRANDA => There!
CARSON => Okay... work with me here!
LISA => Hurry, please hurry...
CARSON => DON'T!
CARSON =>  We have to go out the window.
MRS. HAN => Can't you disarm the bomb?
CARSON => Too risky. Let's concentrate on getting you out of here.
CARSON =>  Sound detectors?
MRS. HAN => Sam covered them with chewing gum.
SAM => High-tech problem, low-tech solution.
CARSON => Pressure sensors. Use 'em in convertibles: Bad guy sits on your seat, he sets the alarm off. These are rigged backwards -- get up, you set 'em off.
SAM => You a bomb expert?
CARSON => Nope. But I've had some car alarms in my day.  For all the goddamn good they do...
CARSON =>  Slide your arm forward... Watch the meter... Keep the pressure on the armrest with your elbow...
CARSON =>  It'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate the weight of your arm... Okay... pick it up.
CARSON =>  Low-tech solution...  Lean back... Carefully.
MIRANDA =>  How's it going in there?
CARSON =>  Nag, nag, nag...
CARSON => You'll be over in five seconds...
CARSON => Tell 'em I'm gonna release the hook and ride down on the line.
CARSON =>  Release the cable from your side! Get out of here!
MIRANDA =>  Come over the railing! Grab onto the harness!
MIRANDA => Tear the hook loose!
PILOT => It'll pop the winch buckle!
MIRANDA => Try it anyway!
CARSON =>  ...I'll call you next week.
MIRANDA => Who was that on the phone?
CARSON => The Bureau.  They want me back on the hostage team.
MIRANDA => What did you say?
CARSON => Told 'em I'd sleep on it...
MIRANDA => Working with you today was certainly... interesting, Inspector.
CARSON => It's my outstanding people skills.
MIRANDA => I hate this fucking town...
