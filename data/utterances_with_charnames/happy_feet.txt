TEACHER => Settle class. Settle. We will begin with the most important lesson you will ever learn. Now does anyone know what that is?
TEACHER => Michael?
MICK => Don't eat yellow snow?
TEACHER => True but, that's not it. Mumble?
MUMBLE => Swimming? Catching Food?
TEACHER => Anyone else?
ELLA => It's our Heartsong, Miss.

MICK => Me! Me! I've got one!  "I can't get no...satisfaction.... I can't get no...girly action..."
TEACHER => Well Michael, if you think that's really you. What have you got for us, Ella?

NORMA J. => No. All fine. Normal incubation, wasn't it honey?
WISHFUL => Well Yeah, it was a kinda...a tough winter I guess, and he did hatch a little late, but...  Is there really nothing we can do?

MUMBLE => Feelink...ok.
MRS ASTRAKHAN => And be spontanuous.
MRS ASTRAKHAN => No! Stop! No jiggy-jog!
MUMBLE => I'm being spontanuous.
MRS ASTRAKHAN => Not with the feet, with the sonk! You vant to meet beautiful girl? You vant to make the Egg?
MUMBLE => Oh yes.
MRS ASTRAKHAN => Well singk! "Ba Ba Bleckship, tvinklestar...La la la la la la, la".
MUMBLE =>  "Twinkle, twinkle, little star. How I..."
MRS ASTRAKHAN => Hokay. Enough. Stop. Hokay! Ve go back to the top. Forget the body, look inside the soul. No notes, no sonk, only feelink. Happy feelink. Sad feelink. Enormous feelink, so enormous it fills the whole body. It must escape or you explode! Now, open your leetle beak...
MRS ASTRAKHAN => Yes, yes, lift up the head! That's it!
MRS ASTRAKHAN => You take a big breath, good and...now! Now!
MRS ASTRAKHAN => Disaster! Catastroff! I never fail! Never!
MUMBLE => Its tough when you realise you'll never fit in. Plus I was beginning to moult
MUMBLE => I couldn't face the class in this mood So I just kept going.

CARUSO => Graduates, today you leave the safety of our community for the first time, forsaking the trusted solid ice for the terrible magic of the deep.
MUMBLE => Caruso. He couldn't help himself.
CARUSO. => Things are not as they were. For five years now we have known nothing but famine. But you are our hope. Upon your survival depends the very future of the entire Penguin Nation. Dive deep, swim far. May the Great Penguinus go with you. And remember...

MUMBLE => But its dead. It can't hurt you
ADELIES => ...Maybe its got a brother still alive.
MUMBLE => But that's what we have to find out. Don't you see. Things like that could be eating the fish.
ADELIES => Okay. Okay. Here's the plan: we go and ask the revered one.
MUMBLE => The who?
THE ADELIES => ...Reverend Loveday. ...The One who Knows ...First we gonna need stones though
MUMBLE => Why stones? Wait for me
LOVEDAY => First, the devotion...
LOVEDAY => A moment...  ... and your question?
LOVEDAY => The Mystic Beings are speaking to me. Yes! She is alive and happy and you are in her thoughts...
LOVEDAY => One pebble, one question. Next!
LOVEDAY => I sense...you are the one with the question.
ADELIE => ...How does he do it? ...He just one look and he know.
LOVEDAY => A little nervous? That's normal. Take your time.
MUMBLE => I was wondering. Have You ever been abducted by Aliens?
LOVEDAY => No time wasters. Next!
THE ADELIES => ...Seor! That's not his question. He's new here.  ...The yellow thing ...Ask him what's taking the fish?
MUMBLE =>  ...you see I met a Skua once, with something like that on his legs....
LOVEDAY => ...Skua? Leg? What's he talking about?
MUMBLE => ... and he said he was abducted by Aliens.
LOVEDAY =>  Listen friend, this is my Sacred Talisman, bestowed upon me by the Mystic Beings...
MUMBLE => Looks like they bestowed it very tight.
LOVEDAY => ...during my Epic Journey of Enlightenment to the Forbidden Shore!
MUMBLE => So these Mystic Beings, did you see them?
LOVEDAY => I hear them. They talk to me all the time I am their instrument. They chose me to......
MUMBLE => Did they have frontways eyes? No feathers? Fat flabby faces? Did they probe you and stick a pointy thing into you?
LOVEDAY => Enough! How many questions is that? You don't have enough pebbles.
MUMBLE => But I haven't had any answers yet!
LOVEDAY => SILENCIO!! The Mystic Beings are speaking. They say show some respect stranger. Especially to the One who Knows.
LOVEDAY => The reason there are not enough fish is simple: There is not enough love in the world. Love is the answer!
LOVEDAY =>  Okay, everybody, turn around to the penguin next to you and give them a great big hug. Comeon, everybody...hug! This is a safe place.
LOVEDAY => Now. The Mating Season starts today so here's what everybody should do: go forth and multiply! If you'll excuse I myself must retire for a moment to the couch of indulgence... okay ladies, who's gonna be first
FEMALE ADELIES => ..Me Loveday. ..Me! ..No Me !
LOVEDAY => One at a time! And don't touch the Talisman!
ADELIES => ....I liked him better when he was just plain Pedro. ...Did he say it starts today ...why didn't someone tell us. ...We gotta get to work guys!!
THE ADELIES => ...Hola Baby! Get your chica boom-boom here. ... Turn round, look at us!.
FEMALE => ...How many rocks you got.
HER FRIEND => ...Forget `em honey. They only one between the six of them...and they just spent it.
AN ADELIE =>  Wait. Look.
ADELIES => ...You like it ...Arriba! ...What do you need stones for
FEMALE FRIEND => Try sitting on the ice for a month. It might come to you Salsa Boy. Come on, Consuela.
THE ADELIES => ...Their loss, guys. ...Ramon, where you going?
RAMON => Gotta be some rocks left here somewhere!  Hey big guy, got any love stones over where you come from?

AN ADELIE => Man. You're an emperor all right, You're a king among emperors. The singing we can fix.
MUMBLE => You can?!
AN ADELIE => No problem. Which way's this colony of yours?
ADELIES => ...We'll all come. ...Yeah I like em tall. ...You jus' gotta do exac'ly as I say.

ELLA =>  When you left without saying goodbye I thought something had happened, then I thought he just doesn't care.
MUMBLE => Don't care? I never stopped thinking about you.
ELLA => And then when I saw you singing, for a second I thought...
MUMBLE => I can't sing.
ELLA => I know. I know. Its impossible.
MUMBLE => But I'll show you something better

ELLA =>  What's the point. It's embarrassing

CARUSO =>  STOP...THIS...DEPRAVITY!!!
CARUSO => WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS ABOMINATION?!!
MUMBLE => I'm just showing them Happy Feet
CARUSO => Happy WHAT?! This is an OUTRAGE!
CARUSO. => It is exactly this kind of disrespectful, heretic behaviour that has brought the Scarcity upon us! Don't you see...we are being brought to account by the Forefathers!
THE ELDERS => ... The kid was never quite the full Penguin. ... It all began the year he hatched. ... That's right! He's the one who brought the blight!
MUMBLE =>  Wait. Wait. You think it's my fault that there are no fish?!! Doing Happy Feet can't cause a food shortage.
AN ELDER => ...then what did?!
MUMBLE => My own opinion? I think living beyond the ice there are creatures we've never met before Aliens. Mystic Beings. Big, flabby......
ELDERS =>  ...He has abandoned the faith. ...He has driven the fish away.
THE ADELIES =>  ...Come on hombre, loosen up, ...the tall guy was just trying to....
AN ELDER => Don't touch me! Heathen!!
MUMBLE => BACK OFF, YA SCREWY-ASS FLIPPERBIRD!
THE ELDERS =>  ...Skua talk!! He's talking Skua talk!   CONTINUED: THE ELDERS ...He's the spawn of evil!! ...The devil penguin!!!
MUMBLE => This is craziness
A VOICE => No, Son they're right.
MUMBLE => You too pa?!
WISHFUL => Truth is, I'm the cause of it. I dropped the egg. I made you how you are. If only you'd come back to us, relinquish the dark side
MUMBLE => No. Dad. No. What have they done to you. You're talking like Caruso.
WISHFUL => Just do it. Pray to the Forefathers for forgiveness.
MUMBLE => No. You're nuts. All of you. I'm outa here.
ELLA => Wait! Mumble!
MUMBLE => Its no use Ella. I can't live with that.
ELLA => Can you live without it?
ELLA => I believe in you, Mumble. But without the huddle we can't make an egg. Without the egg, what are we here for?
ADELIES => ...True ...That's a big question
MUMBLE => Guys. Can Me and Ella be alone for a bit
MUMBLE => OK. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to talk an alien. I'm going to find what's causing the shortage
ELLA => But what about?...
MUMBLE => Its the only way. You're right. Unless we have food theres no future for any of us - you, me the adelies, anyone
ELLA => But...
MUMBLE => Give me a year, just until the next great gathering. If I don't make it back ....at least I tried
ELLA => But...
MUMBLE => Now go back. I love you. Go.
CARUSO => "Together we stand"
ALL => "Divided we freeze."
ALL => Recite the Wisdoms!
ALL => "In the Wisdoms we trust."
CARUSO => "When all others leave..."
ALL => "We Remain."
CARUSO => Louder. More fervent bretheren. "When the Sun vanishes..."
ALL => "We Remain."
ADELIES => Tell me again where we're going.
MUMBLE => To find the mystic beings.
ADELIES => How do we know where they live.
MUMBLE => We'll ask Loveday. He's been there.
MOTHER => ...Not so close. We got babies on board
ADELIES => ...Wow. Does nesting make em touchy
THE ADELIES => ...LOVEDAY, you okay?? ...what happened ...Too much boom-boom for one penguin?
MUMBLE => Just one question! And I want a straight answer! Where do I find the Mystic Beings?
AN ADELIE => Why don't he speak?
AN ADELIE => Talisman...sounds like Talisman!!
ADELIES => ...He's possessed! ...It's a seizure!
MUMBLE => No. He's choking! The Talisman's gotten way too tight.
THE ADELIES => ...Why din' you say so? ...Hold on we gonna take it off. ...You pull that side, I pull this side.
MUMBLE => Stop. You're hurting him.
AN ADELIE => Any better?
THE ADELIES => ...It not gonna come off. ...Of course it's not! It's sacred!
MUMBLE => LOVEDAY, where did you get it?
THE ADELIES => ...It was bestowed on him. ...By the Mystic Beings!
MUMBLE => They didn't bestow it on you?
THE ADELIES => ...Poor Guy. ...He don't know what he's saying.
MUMBLE => If it wasn't bestowed, what happened?
THE ADELIES => ...Oh, this one's easy. ...He swam.... ...On his Hectic Journey of Delightenment... ...To the Forbidding Shore.
MUMBLE => And then....?
AN ADELIE => ...Well to me that's gotta be bestowing.
MUMBLE => You looked up and...... It just got caught around your neck?
ADELIES => ...No way. No. He's the revered one ...He speaking symbolically.
MUMBLE =>  Loveday, did you ever meet a Mystic Being? Really?
MUMBLE => But this thing was made by someone. And if we find them, they could take it off.
MUMBLE => So where do we Go, Loveday
AN ADELIE => Oh my! Now he thinks he's an Elephant Seal
AN ADELIE => He wants to go to the top of the mountain.
MUMBLE => The forbidden place is over the mountains...
MUMBLE => ...In the land of the Elephant Seals!!?
MUMBLE => ...Beyond the land of the Elephant Seals!!?
MUMBLE => So who's coming
LOVEDAY => Oi
ADELIES => ...Stop. Enough. We must've gone past it ...Past? Don't kid me. We're not even close.
MUMBLE => Hear that?!
THE ADELIES => ...Refresh my memory do elephant seals eat penguin? ...No, no...jus' krill and fish. ...Sure of your facts are you?
ADELIES => Well I guess we're about to find out
MUMBLE => Excuse me, we need directions...to the Forbidden Shore.
MUMBLE => We're looking for the Mystic Beings
MUMBLE => Aliens, the ones who made this.
MUMBLE => Could they be taking our fish?
MUMBLE => But If your grandpappys saw them and they survived, maybe they're not so fierce.
SEAL #1 => You calling me a liar son?
SEAL #2 => He's calling your grandpappy a liar. And you know what, Maybe he's right.
SEAL#1 => Why you. Flop over here and say that!
MUMBLE => Come on Loveday, lets go
ADELIES =>  ...Go where? ...didn't you hear what he said ...Its Forbidden
MUMBLE => They don't know. They've never been there
AN ADELIE => Stop! I'm hearing voices. The mystical guys. They say: "Your life is perfectly good as it is...forget this stupid mission".
ANOTHER ADELIE => Ramon. That was embarrassing, man.
MUMBLE => So we walked ... and walked .. and kept walking. Over the hills and into Blizzard country
THE ADELIES => ...Oh man! This is no place for a penguin! ...We should be migrating out to sea by now!
MUMBLE => We need to huddle!
THE ADELIES => Huddle??!
MUMBLE => Form a moving circle! Share the cold, share the warmth!
THE ADELIES => ...Oh yeah, nice. ...That's definitely better. ...Good call big guy.
MUMBLE => I said a circle!
AN ADELIE => ...No, no. This can't be right! ...It was better the other way.
THE ADELIES => ...Hey! ...What happened to the Huddle?!
MUMBLE =>  Just keep moving! Toboggan, if you have to!!
THE ADELIES => ...Oh no, now I got chest pain ...tell you, this is a good way to get snow blind 
MUMBLE => You think this is it? The Forbidden Shore?
ADELIES => ....The way I feel": the "frostbitten" shore ....So what are those black things?.
MUMBLE => Hello?! Is there anyone out there?
MUMBLE => Hello!!
THE ADELIES => ...No need to shout. ...Yeah, somebody might hear you. ...I think we seen all there is to see round here.
MUMBLE => What is it?
MUMBLE => They must be here somewhere. They wouldn't leave all this stuff lying around.
AN ADELIE => Maybe they invisible.
AN ADELIE => What is that?
MUMBLE => A whale?
AN ADELIE => As long as it's a good whale, not the other kind.
ANOTHER ADELIE => What other kind?!!
MUMBLE => The ones with teeth!!
THE ADELIES => ...Jump! ...Swim for it!
MUMBLE => No!! Stay on the ice pad where its safe
THE ADELIES => ...You call this safe amigo? ...Maybe we should split up. ...You split up I'm staying right here.

THE ADELIES => ...You found them, you found Aliens! ...Now we go back tell everybody who's taking the fish.
THE ADELIES => ...Don't feel bad Tall Guy. ...They were just too fast. Too big. ...Too everything.
MUMBLE => They've stopped!
LOVEDAY => Mumble. I owe you my life amigo. And I say this because I admire and deeply respect you. If you are thinking what I think you are thinking. You are out of your crazy head
MUMBLE => Say Hi to Ella for me

MUMBLE => Oh. One other thing. You guys
ADELIES => What?
MUMBLE => Excelsi yah!!!
THE ADELIES => ...can you believe that ...brought us all this way and killed himself ...no he didn't! look!
THE ADELIES => ...A dive like that, and still he lives! ... Yeah like when he did his Happy Feet, his feet had wings. ...A normal penguin could never have done it.
LOVEDAY => You don't think we should go with him
ADELIES => ...Don't sweat it Revered One. Many are called, few are chosen.   CONTINUED: ADELIES ..Hey, how tall you think the Tall Guy was? ...Who could say? Four times my height at least...
LOVEDAY => About this Revered One stuff, you guys
AN ADELIE => Yeah
LOVEDAY => Maybe just call me Pedro
MUMBLE =>  HEY! YOU CAN'T DO THAT! WHAT ABOUT US?! THE SCARCITY! THE SCARCITY!!
MUMBLE => HEY YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET AWAY WITH THIS?!! NOT IF I CAN HELP IT YOU SHIT- SQUIRTER ALIEN CREEPS.
MUMBLE => Too loud.
MUMBLE => Too loud!
ALBATROSS => He's looking for a mate, mate. And these days, I tell you they're few and far between
ALBATROSS => Talking of which, I never seen a penguin this far out. Watch you don't hit The Convergence mate.
MUMBLE => The Convergence?
ALBATROSS => Where the cold water meets the warm, mate. Once you cross it, there's no getting' back. What you tryinmg to prove anyway?
MUMBLE => I'm trying to talk to the Aliens!
ALBATROSS => The who?
MUMBLE => On the black iceberg. The ones taking all the fish!
ALBATROSS => Them. Fish is just the start of it Mate. Them aliens is the ones who took out the whales.
MUMBLE => They kill whales! That's impossible
ALBATROSS => Straight up mate. Biggest creatures ever lived. Decimated, mate.
MUMBLE => So if I wanted to talk to them, where would I go
ALBATROSS => Anywhere and everywhere. Over the sea, under the sea, Jees, I've even seen them fly. The great southland's swarming with em
MUMBLE => Where's that. Do you think the Whale would take me there?
ALBATROSS => No way mate, he won't go anywhere near `em. And neither should you.
ALBATROSS => Don't say I didn't warn you
MUMBLE => When I finally saw one, the Alien was even more hideous than I'd imagined
MUMBLE => ... frontways eyes, no feathers. Big teeth with blood around them. Strange fleshy beak. A meat eater
MUMBLE =>  The - fish - are - ours. Understand?
MUMBLE => We can't live without them!
MUMBLE => Speak Adelie? Skua-talk?
MUMBLE => Oh no! Not the pointy thing!
MUMBLE => I woke in darkness. Unable to move. Was I dead? And if I was dead, where was that light coming from
MUMBLE => Wow. They brought me home
MUMBLE => Excuse me, where are we.
PENGUIN => Heaven. Where d'you think?
MUMBLE => Oh. So we're dead. Right
PENGUIN => Dunno. Don't care. We got food. We got water. You hear a seal now and then, but you never meet one. Perfect.
PENGUIN => Fish!
MUMBLE => Where?
PENGUINS => Fish time. Fish time!
MUMBLE => Every day after that, it rained fish in the afternoon.
MUMBLE => Fish on land and fish underwater.
MUMBLE => Sometime you got a live one but there was nowhere really to chase it
MUMBLE => Aliens everywhere, watching you eat, watching you sleep
MUMBLE =>  What have you done to my wing! This is not my home! I want to get out of here!
MUMBLE => After a while, you learn to stop fighting it. Stop protesting, take the knocks.
MUMBLE => ...just take what comes and live inside your mind
MUMBLE => Sometimes I thought about dad and mum. Sometimes the Amigos, and others I'd met along the way. But mostly I thought about Ella, wondering who she ended up with. Whether she had enough food to eat. whether she still remembered our song.
YOUNG GIRL => Look Mommy! It's dancing!
MUMBLE => What? What did I do?
MUMBLE => You like that? Well how about this.
PENGUIN #1 => Oh-Oh, another one gone troppo
PENGUIN #2 => You think its infectious
PENGUIN #3 => I sure hope not
MUMBLE (VO => Yes. Yes. At last something was happening. I was finally getting through to them!
PENGUIN V/O'S => ...What's that? ...Where? ...Coming from the Inland!
PENGUINS => ...Is it a Penguin? ...Is it one of ours?
MUMBLE => Hi, where is everybody!?
PENGUINS => Who wants to know?
MUMBLE => I used to live here. When's the Great Gathering?
PENGUINS => This is it. I guess
MUMBLE => This is all that's left?
PENGUINS => ... So Who's this? ...Kinda small for an emperor. ... Where did you say you were from?
ELLA => Mumble?! Its Mumble!!
MUMBLE => Ella! Is it you. You haven't changed a bit.
MUMBLE => Are these all yours?
ELLA => They're my singing students.
MUMBLE => So. You never....
ELLA => Of course not. I was waiting for you.
MUMBLE => But that's fantastic. I've got so much to tell you - to tell everyone.  I found out who's been causing the Scarcity!
ELLA => Huh?
MUMBLE => I know who's been taking our fish! I made contact with Aliens! They're coming here. Right behind me. Listen.
PENGUINS => ...Who's doing all the shouting ...Its Mumble. He's worse than before.
MUMBLE => No, honestly Aliens will be here soon! You have to believe me. We came in a big hollow bird and they landed on the ice and....
CARUSO. => You again! And still full of the same old nonsense.
MUMBLE => But its true!!
CARUSO. => Move along everyone. Pay no attention. There's no such thing as aliens
ELLA => So who fixed him up with this.
PENGUINS => ...Does it hurt? ....Its not made of feathers thats for sure ...what's it gonna do
MUMBLE => It's so they can find me.  That's them now. Listen.
CARUSO => You led them here. Are you crazy!!
MUMBLE => You said they didn't exist.
CARUSO => They'll slaughter us. Head for the sea!
MUMBLE => No. Do this. Do Happy feet.
MUMBLES => Its what they understand. They can't talk, they can't sing. They speak with their feet. Do it.
CARUSO. => Now look what you've done!
PENGUINS => ...its the end of the world. ....Its all Mumbles fault. I told you
WISHFUL => Just do what the kid says.
CARUSO => Recite the wisdoms! "Together we stand". "Divided We Freeze".
MUMBLE => Come on, everyone! Happy Feet! It's our only chance!
CARUSO => "When all others leave, we Remain
MUMBLE => FEET!!
CARUSO => CHANT!!
MUMBLE => FEET! FEET!! HAPPY FEET!!
MUMBLE => That's it! Excellent! Riba Riba, penguinos! Shake those hips. Come on, bust a move!!
CARUSO. => Adhere to the wisdoms!! The Ancients will protect us
PENGUINS => ....Aliens. ... I never doubted it for a moment
MRS ASTRAKHAN => More feelink. BE SPONTANUOUS!!
WISHFUL =>  You know who that is? That's my boy!
MRS ASTRAKHAN =>  Know him? He ees my star pupol! I TEACH HIM EVERYTHINGK!
MUMBLE => From that day on, No one quite knows how it happened, but the black icebergs began to disappear and the fish became abundant once more.
CHAIRMAN => ...So what do you reckon?
EXPERT => Yes, quite extraordinary. (stares at the screen) some kind of neurological disorder? a nutritional deficiency perhaps. We'd certainly back the long-term study.
CHAIRMAN => And the international treaty?
DELEGATE#1 => Yes. This is exactly the leverage we need for an embargo. No fishing whatsoever...legal, illegal, sanctioned, whatever.
DELEGATE#2 => So we all step up policing of the pirate factory ships. And we pressure that country to stop their so-called `experimental' fishing.
DELEGATE#3 => Yes, if our government asks your government to approach their government to call off their fleet...
DELEGATE#2 => Better if their government hear it from our government via your government...
CHAIRMAN => What the heck. The amount of publicity this is generating, they'd have world war three if they didn't stop.
MUMBLE => Ella's gave up teaching to look after our chick. We take turns looking after her and going to get the fish.
MUMBLE => I worry about her, sure. Theres so much big stuff out there it can be kind of frightening.
MUMBLE => But the way I see it. Theres so much out there we don't understand...,
MUMBLE (V.0 => Or am I not making sense here?
VOICE#1 => Is there a problem? I thought this one was barren.
VOICE#2 => More or less. But one of the stars we're harvesting supports these things here.
VOICE#1 => So...?
VOICE#2 => Well. Exactly. But what we didn't know about before was these things here
VOICE#2 => Just thought you'd want to see them before...you know.
VOICE#1 => Hmm.   Charming
VOICE#2 => So.    We go ahead. Or...?
VOICE#1 => No. Better leave them be. See what sector twelves got to offer instead.
