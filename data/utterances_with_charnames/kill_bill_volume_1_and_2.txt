OVER BLACK => We hear labored breathing.
BLACK FRAME => QUOTE APPEARS:
MAN => Do you find me sadistic?
audience. => But what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the "BILL" of the title.
BILL => I bet I could fry an egg on your head about now, if I wanted to.
BILL => No kiddo, I'd like to believe, even now, you're aware enough to know there isn't a trace of sadism in my actions... Okay - Maybe towards these other jokers - bot not your.
OVERHEAD SHOT => We see for a moment, A WIDE SHOT looking down at the woman on the floor. Bill  bent down over her. Four others in black suits, standing over her (three are female, one is male). And about four DEAD BODIES lying in their own blood. We also see we're in a wedding chapel that's been redecorated by blood death and gunfire. And firstly or lastly, depending on the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a white bridal gown. This woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth she will only be referred to as The BRIDE.
BILL => No Kiddo at this moment, this is me at my most masochistic.
THE BRIDE => Bill, I'm pregnant. It's your baby.

THE BRIDE => That's Arthur. Arthur Plympton. The
Arthur. => Obviously you'll have to take my word on this. Speaking of names, I was about two seconds away from becoming Mrs. Charles Arthur Plympton.
THE BRIDE => And that, that's me. I'm the Bride.
THE BRIDE => Looked dead, didn't I? Well I wasn't, but it wasn'T for lack fo trying, I can tell you that. Actually Bill's last bullet put me in a coma. A coma I was to lie in for five years. When I woke up, ...I went on what the movie advertisements refer to as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. I roarded and I rampaged and I got bloody satisfaction. In all, I've killed 33 people to get to this piont right now. I have only one more. The last one.
destination..... => .... I'm gonna Kill Bill.
BLACK FRAME => TITLE APPEARS:
The BRIDE => on the porch; we do a quick Shaw-Brothers-style Zoom into her eyes.
The HOUSEWIFE => KICKS The Bride, sending her CRASHING backwards into the small table where the phone, a note pad , and the mail is kept.
The HOUSEWIFE => hops off The Bride, runs into the kitchen, opens a drawer and comes out with a HUGE MOTHERFUCKIN BUTCHER KNIFE.
The BRIDE => rises from the floor, and WHIPS OUT a KNIFE in a sheath hanging from her belt known as a SOG. (A SOG is a long, double-edged knife that's as sharp as a razor, and is what Navy Seals use to kill humans with.)
FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL => Mommy, I'm home!
THE HOUSEWIFE => Hey baby, how was school?
LITTLE GIRL => Mommy, what happened to you and the T.V. Room?
THE HOUSEWIFE => Oh, that good for nothin dog of yours, got his little ass in the living room and acted a damn fool, that's what happened.
LITTLE GIRL => Barney did this?
THE    HOUSEWIFE => Now baby, you    can't come in here, there's broken    glass all over the floor, and you    gonna cut yourself.
THE HOUSEWIFE => This is a old friend of mommy's I ain't seen in a long time.
THE BRIDE => Hello sweety, I'm **, what's your name?
THE HOUSEWIFE => Her name is Nikki.
THE BRIDE => Nikki. What a pretty name for such a pretty little girl. How old are you Nikki?
THE HOUSEWIFE => Nikki, ** aked you a question.
NIKKI =>  I'm four.
THE BRIDE => Four years    old, aye. You know I once had a    little girl. She'd be five right    now. Maybe you two could of played    with each other.
THE HOUSEWIFE => Now baby, me an ** have some grown-up talk to talk about, so you go in your room now and leave us alone till I tell you to come out.
THE HOUSEWIFE =>  Nikkia - in your room - now.
THE HOUSEWIFE => Want some coffee?
THE BRIDE => Yeah, sure.
THE HOUSEWIFE => Cream and sugar?
THE BRIDE => Both, please.
THE BRIDE => This Pasadena homemaker's name is Jeanne Bell. Her husband is Dr. Lawrence Bell. But back when we were acquainted, five years ago, her name was VERNITA GREEN. Her code name, was "COBRA"..... Mine was BLACK MAMBA.
THE BRIDE => Were you expecting me?
VERNITA => Yes and no. Bill got in touch with me right after you woke up, and then again a little later after your episode in Japan.  So I suppose it's a little late for a apology, huh?
THE BRIDE => You suppose correctly.
VERNITA => Even if I was sincere?
THE BRIDE => Oh. I'm quite positive you're sorry, now.
VERNITA => Look bitch, I need to know if you're gonna start anymore shit around my baby girl!
THE BRIDE => You can relax for now. I'm not going to murder you in front of your daughter.
VERNITA => That's being more rational than Bill led me to believe you were capable of.
THE BRIDE => Well that's a demonstration of Bill's complete ignorance when it comes to the subject of me, and what I'm thinking, and what I might do. It's mercy, compassion, and forgiveness I lack, not rationality.
THE BRIDE => I'll wait for now, but I won't wait for long. I'll allow you to choose a time and place for us to meet again, preferably as far away from Nikki as possible. I could have just HIT you, I didn't, I demand respect for that. Since this is not a HIT, consider it a DUEL. And as two former Deadly Vipers, we will observe Viper rules of honor. One on one - no help - no bushwhackin - no treacherous weapons - on weapon of choice - our skill and our bodies.
VERNITA => **
THE BRIDE => - I'm not through telling you. Failure to keep our date, or duplicity of any kind, will result in me putting a xoxo hollow point bullet into the back of your skull from a window of a building across the street from Nikki's elementary school. Now, feel free to respond.
VERNITA => Look...I know I fucked you over. I fucked you over bad. I wish to God I hadn't, but I did.
VERNITA => If I could go back in a machine I would, but I can't. All I can tell you is I'm a different person now.
THE BRIDE => I don't care.
VERNITA => Be that as it may, I know I do not deserve mercy or forgiveness. However, I beseech you for both on behalf of my daughter.
THE BRIDE => -- Bitch, you can stop right there.
THE BRIDE =>  Just because I have no wish to murder you before the eyes of your daughter, does not mean parading her around in front of me is going to inspire sympathy. You and I have unfinished business.
VERNITA => You have every right to wanna get even --
THE BRIDE => -- But that's where you're wrong, Vernita. I don't want to get even. To get even, even Steven. I would have to kill you, go into Nikki's room, kill her, then wait for your old man, Dr. Bell, to come home and kill him. That would make us even. No, my unborn daughter will just hafta be satisfied with your death at her mother's hands.
VERNITA => When do we do this?
THE BRIDE => It all depends... When do you want to die? Tomorrow? The day after tomorrow? That's about as long as I'll wait.
VERNITA => How bout tonight, bitch?
THE BRIDE => Spendid. Where?
VERNITA => There's a baseball diamond where our little league has its games, about a mile from here. We meet there around two-thirty in the morning, dressed all in black, your hair in a black stocking, and we have us a knife fight, we won't be
THE BRIDE => Bill said you were one of the best ladies he'd ever seen with an edged weapon.
VERNITA => Fuck you, bitch, I know he didn't qualify it, so you can just kiss my motherfuckin ass, Black Mamba.  Black Mamba, I shoulda been motherfuckin Black Mamba.
THE BRIDE => Weapon of choice? And if you want to stick with your butcher knife, I'm cool with that.
VERNITA => Very funny.
VERNITA => Sorry, bout the bushwhack. Please don't...
THE BRIDE => Do to your daughter, what you did to mine...  ...I won't.
THE BRIDE => It was not my intention to do this in front of you. For that I'm sorry. But you can take my word for it, your mother had it coming. When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be waiting.
VERNITA GREEN => COBRA

HANZO => Yes you may.....
HANZO => ...try the second one down in the sixth row on your left.
HANZO => Funny, you like samurai swords...
HANZO => ...I like baseball.
HANZO => I wanted to show you these.... However someone as you, who knows so much must surely know, I no longer make instruments of death. I keep these here for their ascetic and sentimental value. (he takes both sword and sheath from her...) Yet proud tho I am of my life's work... (...he closes them together) I am retired.

HANZO => These are not for sale.
THE BRIDE => I didn't say, sell me. I said, give me.

HANZO => ...You can sleep there...
HANZO => ...it will take me a week to make the sword...
HANZO => ...I suggest you spend it practicing.
OVER BLACK => TITLE APPEARS:
HANZO => I'm done doing what I swore an oath to God 28 years ago to never do again. I've created, "something that kills people." And in that purpose I was a success.
HANZO => I've done this, because philosophically I'm sympathetic to your aim.
HANZO => I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword. If on your journey, you should encounter God, God will be cut.
HANZO => Revenge is never a straight line. It's a forest. And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...to get lost... to forget where you came in. To serve as a compass, a combat philosophy must be adopted that can be found in the secret doctrine of the Yagu Ninja. And now my yellow haired warrior, repeat after me;
HANZO => "When engaged in combat, the vanquishing of thine enemy can be the warrior's only concern...
HANZO => ...This is the first and cardinal rule of combat...
HANZO => ...Suppress all human emotion and compassion...
HANZO => This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat. Once it is mastered... Thou shall fear no one... Though the devil himself may bar thy way...

THE BRIDE => At the age of twenty, Bill backed his Nippon progeny financially and philosophically in her Shakespearian-in-magnitude power struggle with the other Yakuza clans, over who would rule vice in the city of Tokyo.
THE BRIDE => When it was all over, it was the geisha-regaled O-Ren Ishii that proved the victor.
THE BRIDE => And just in case you're wondering how could a half breed Japanese Chinese American become the boss of all criminal activity in Tokyo, Japan,... I'll tell you. The subject of O-Ren's blood and nationality came up before the council only once. The night O-Ren assumed power over the crime council.
THE BRIDE => The man who seems bound and determined to break the mood is Boss Tanaka. And what Boss Tanaka thinks is...
BOSS TANAKA => And what exactly should I be celebrating? The perversion of our illustrious council?
O-REN => Gentlemen...Boss Tanaka obviously has something on his mind. Allow him to express it.
BOSS TANAKA => My father...  ...along with yours and...  ...along With yours, started this council. And while you drink like fish and laugh like donkeys, they weep in the afterlife over the perversion committed today.
Silence! =>  Of what perversion do you speak, Tanaka?

A SPAGHETTI-WESTERN FLASHBACK of O-Ren beating the shit outta her at the wedding chapel IS SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER EYES.

The sword sticks in the floor half way...
OVERHEAD SHOT => Looking down on The    Bride at one end and O-Ren and her crew at the other. A Red    Circle appears where the blade is buried in the floor...The    red circle grows larger...and larger...and larger...and larger    still...
O-Ren => her eyes narrow with rage. She screams out another order;
O-REN => Tear the bitch apart!

Go Go => steps forward and removes her weapon, it's not a samurai sword. It's a heavy metal ball at the end of a long chain. She begins TWIRLING it above her head. Each rotation makes a WHOOSH sound in the air.
The BRIDE => ducks out of the way, the heavy ball destroying a large chunk of wood post behind her.
Go Go => eyes focused on her enemy...WHOOSH....WHOOSH....WHOOSH...she lets fly...
GO GO => smiles...then...WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

MR. BARREL => And you're Black Mamba.
THE BRIDE => Our reputations precede us.
MR. BARREL => Apparently.
THE BRIDE => Tell me Mr. Barrel, why don't you wear your Kato mask? Are you and iconoclast?
MR. BARREL => I don't like that rubber band. It fucks up my hair.
THE BRIDE => You shouldn't work for her.
MR. BARREL => Too late.
THE BRIDE => It's not too late to quit.
MR. BARREL => Do you have choices?
THE BRIDE => No.
MR. BARREL => I know exactly how you feel.
THE BRIDE => This has nothing to do with You and I, and everything to do with me taking satisfaction from that bitch behind you. And there's absolutely positively no way I'M going to leave here without taking that satisfaction. So Mr. Barrel, you have to stand aside. And that means you must quit, right now.
MR. BARREL => I can't.
THE BRIDE => Yes you can.
MR. BARREL => No I can't.
THE BRIDE => Don't say "Can't", there are no "Cant's." Yes - You - Can.....
O-REN ISHII => Screams at her "...last line of defense;"
O-REN => What are you waiting for? Are you on a date? Attack her you fool!
THE BRIDE => Oh my God...  ...She just called you a fool. She just called you a fool in front of me. Not only am I your opponent. I'm a female fellow countryman. And you're going to risk your life - to say nothing of harming me - for a woman who refers to you as a fool?
O-REN => is furious, and slaps Mr. Barrel on the shoulder.
O-REN => Attack, Goddamn you!
THE BRIDE => I'll owe ya one.
MR. BARREL => The things I do for a pretty face.
MR. BARREL => I quit.
MR. BARREL => About that one you owe me.
THE BRIDE => Yes?
MR. BARREL => I'm gonna collect someday, you know?
THE BRIDE => I'll be disappointed if you don't.
MR. BARREL => Tough luck bout that arm Sofe.
O-REN => Very funny.  Your instrument is quite impressive.
THE BRIDE => Domo.
O-REN => Where was it made?
THE BRIDE => Okinawa.
O-REN => Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?
THE BRIDE => This is Hattori Hanzo steel.
O-REN => YOU LIE!!
O-REN => Swords however never get tired. I hope you've saved your energy. If you haven't, you might not last five minutes. 
THE BRIDE => No.
O-REN => Oh, you really should. It's quite beautiful. Allow me.
O-REN => As last looks go, you could do worse.
O-REN'S FEET => White socks in wooden clogs, walk forward, Crunching Snow underneath them...
The BRIDE => Holding Sword...Eyes reflected in Blade...her Yellow Sneakers Crunching snow underneath them...
O-REN => when her Sword is fully unsheathed, the Japanese combat artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, Sword in one hand - Wood sheath in the other, like a bird....
O-REN => Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords. Bill might of humored you, but you will find neither humor nor mercy at my blade. Now unless you intend to commit sepeku among the koi, stand up and fight. You may not be able to fight like a samurai, but you can at least die like a samurai.
THE BRIDE => Attack me. With everything you have.
O-REN => I apologize for ridiculing you earlier.
THE BRIDE => Accepted.
THE BRIDE => Ready?
O-REN => Yes.
O-REN => That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword...
O-REN => I always dreamed of owning one...
O-REN => Did he make it for you?
THE BRIDE => Yes.
O-REN => ...He must of liked you.
The BRIDE => removes a white handkerchief (The One we saw her sewing earlier with "Bill" in the corner), and uses it to wipe the blood, once belonging to the first name on her death list, off her Hanzo Steel.
The BRIDE => now wearing a yellow, faceless motorcycle crash helmet on her head, stands FRAMED in a TRUNK SHOT.
SOFIE FATALE => Minus an arm, lies curled up in the trunk of her MAZDA XOXO.
The BRIDE => behind the wheel wearing her crash helmet. It looks like an insert from "GRAND PRIX."
BLACK SCREEN => The BRIDE lifts up trunk lid, we look up at her FRAMED in the TRUNK SHOT. Helmet on head making her faceless, gold Deadly Viper syringe in her hand.
THE BRIDE => I've kept you alive for one reason. Information. Being O-Ren's lawyer, I take it you're familiar with Bill?
SOFIE => Yes.
THE BRIDE => In fact, I'd guesstimate, you worked for Bill before O-Ren, and that's how it is you came to work for O-Ren. Am I correct?
SOFIE => Yes.
THE BRIDE => I thought so. Give me the arm you have left.
SOFIE => Why?
THE BRIDE => I want information. Now gimme your arm.
THE BRIDE => The cocktail racing    through your bloodstream at this    moment is Bill's own recipe.    He calls it "The Undisputed Truth."
THE BRIDE => Okay, first things first. Where was the other Yubari sister? Yuki?
SOFIE => Yuki's sick. She went home early.
THE BRIDE => Do tell? What's wrong with her?
SOFIE => She has a cold.
THE BRIDE => Awwww poor baby. What do you think she'll do when she finds out what happened?
SOFIE => She'll drink excessively.
SOFIE => She'll start trouble.
BUSINESS SUIT => Do you like Ferraris?
YUKI => Ferrari...Italian trash.
YUKI => Do you find me hot?
YUKI => Don't laugh! Do you want to fuck me, yes or no?
BUSINESS SUIT => Yes.
YUKI => How bout now, big boy, do you still wish to penetrate me...
YUKI => Or is it I who has penetrated you.
SOFIE => When she stops shedding tears, she'll start shedding blood.
THE BRIDE => Best guess, what will she do?
SOFIE => I don't hafta guess, she'll come after you.
THE BRIDE => Will she ever give up?
SOFIE => She won't have to. When she finds
THE BRIDE => Is she more skilled than I?
SOFIE => Skilled won't be the word.
THE BRIDE => Don't be coy with me, bitch. What would be the word?
SOFIE => Crazy.
THE BRIDE => Okay, now I want all the information on the Deadly Vipers,... What they've been doing and where I can find them.
CU SOFIE => in a hospital environment. Bill's voice speaks to her OFF SCREEN;
BILL => Sofie, Sofie, my Sofie, I'm so sorry.
SOFIE => Please forgive my betrayal --
BILL => -- no more of that. I invented that truth serum. Once it entered your bloodstream, you no longer had a choice.
SOFIE => But, still --
BILL => -- But still -- nothing, except my aching heart over what she's done to my beautiful and brilliant Sofie.  If you had to guess why she left you alive, what would be your guess?
SOFIE => Guessing won't be necessary. She informed me.
THE BRIDE => I'm allowing you to keep your wicked life for one reason and one reason only. So you can tell him, in person, everything that happened here tonight. I want him to witness the extent of my mercy..., by witnessing your deformed body. I want you to tell him, all the information you just told me. I want him to know what I know. I want him to know I want him to know.
THE BRIDE => And I want them all to know, they'll all soon be as dead as O REN.
BILL => If O-Ren was number one, unless she's being tricky, Vernita Green will be number two.
YUKI => Where is Vernita Green?
BILL => Los Angeles. Vernita's in Pasadena. But the woman you want will hold up in a low budget motel, fifteen of twenty minutes away from stepping on board a plane departing LAX. If I had to bet...I'd say Hawthorne.
YUKI => California, here I come.
BLACK FRAME => TITLE CARD:
THE BRIDE =>  Two down, and three to go.
YUKI => Conigute wa!
THE BRIDE => Conigute wa.  Yuki?
YUKI => Bingo!
THE BRIDE => Can I help you?
YUKI => You can kill yourself.
YUKI => Taking a trip?
THE BRIDE => I was.
YUKI => You still are. One way.
THE BRIDE => I know you feel you must avenge your sister. But I beg you...walk away.
YUKI => You call that begging? You can beg better than that.
YUKI => Can I see your    face? I've heard your beauty is    exquisite. I would like to see for    myself.
THE BRIDE => Sure.
YUKI => Ohhhh,...look how pretty your face is. Oooohhh,... I want to touch it.
THE BRIDE => Domo.
YUKI => Your face is so    pretty, I just want to put both of    my palms against your cheeks and    give you little tiny kisses.
YUKI => How do I look?
YUKI => You're just saying that 'cause I told you how pretty you are.
THE BRIDE => Yuki, you're gorgeous.
YUKI => Really? Is that how you'd describe me to somebody if I wasn't here? Yuki's gorgeous?
THE BRIDE => You bet.
THE BRIDE => Don't make me kill you.
YUKI => Okay.
YUKI => You think you're safe! I say; Ha!
THE BRIDE => Stay in your house and stay down on the floor!
YUKI => Time for the rabbit to come out of her hole!
THE BRIDE =>  Gotcha!
YUKI => You fucking bitch! You shot me in my breast! They're not fully developed yet, you fucking asshole! Now I'm always gonna have a dimple!
YUKI => Piss me off!
THE BRIDE => Yuki, in about two    minutes there's going to be an army    of police here. So if you're gonna    kill me, now's the time.
THE BRIDE => So what's it gonna be bitch?
YUKI => That fucking does it!
THE BRIDE => Goddamn, what a wildcat.
NURSE OWENS => Hello.
THE BRIDE => Hello, I'm calling Nurse Owens --
NURSE OWENS => Who is this.
THE BRIDE => You don't know me, but --
NURSE OWENS => -- And I don't want to neither. Now
THE BRIDE => -- I've been shot five times --
NURSE OWENS => -- Stop, I don't wanna hear no more. I got problems of my own.
THE BRIDE => I'm dying.
NURSE OWENS => Then bitch, you better call yourself a ambulance, cause I don't do this shit no more.
THE BRIDE => I can't call an ambulance.
NURSE OWENS => --    No, you can call a ambulance, you    just don't want to. But if your ass    is really dying, you ain't got no    motherfuckin choice.
THE BRIDE => I do have a choice, and I'm choosing to call you. If you refuse to help me, I'll die. And that will be your choice.
NURSE OWENS => Bitch, I don't even know you!
THE BRIDE => What do you need to know? I'm from Earth, I'm a woman, I'm dying, and only you can help me.
NURSE OWENS => Okay, where you at?
THE BRIDE => I'm in Hawthorne. I'm hiding in a kids treehouse. It's a street called, "Dimmick". 1-7-3-6 Dimmick Avenue. There's a bunch of police cars and firetrucks, about two blocks away.
NURSE OWENS => Whatcha do, crawl two blocks?
THE BRIDE => If you can't walk, you better crawl.
NURSE OWENS => You got you some money dontcha, or am I doin this out of the goodness of my heart?
THE BRIDE => You come and get me, today's pay day.
NURSE OWENS => You ain't too far away. You gonna bleed to death I get there in a half a hour?
THE BRIDE => Probably.
NURSE OWENS => Okay, I'll be there in fifteen minutes.
THE BRIDE => Is that Pacific Standard Time, or C.P.T.?
NURSE OWENS => Just you better be there    when I get there, and you better be    shot five times, and your bony ass    better be on your last motherfuckin    legs.
THE BRIDE => How do you know I have a bony ass?
NURSE OWENS => You sound like you have a bony ass.
THE BRIDE => Glad you made it.
NURSE OWENS => There's cops all over here, I had to be cool. They tend to notice things like Negroes sneaking around people's backyards.
THE BRIDE => What's that?
NURSE OWENS => This shit's gonna hurt, and I ain't got no anesthetic.
OVERHEAD SHOT => The Bride laid out on Nurse Owens' kitchen table, while the nurse extracts the bullets.
THE BRIDE => That fuckin smarts.
NURSE OWENS => Yeah, bullets are bad news. In the future, you should avoid them if you can.
THE BRIDE => I'll keep that in mind. So, do I have a future?
NURSE OWENS => You'll live to kill again.
THE BRIDE => Splendid.
BLACK FRAME => TITLE CARD:
DOORMAN => Yes?
TWO EYES => I heard you had a game?
DOORMAN => Who are you?
TWO EYES => They call me Bill.
DOORMAN => Bill what?
BILL => That, no one ever calls me.
FEMALE VOICE => Open the door Alburt, let's see what this Bill looks like.
L.F. O'BOYLE => Are you a policeman, Bill?
BILL => Not anymore?
L.F. => Let him play, Alburt.
L.F. =>  We now return to the game already in progress. The point is nine gentlemen, nine is the point...
ALBURT => I'll take that.
BILL => You'll have to.
L.F. => Now now boys...Mr. Bill, do you intend to start any shit with that sword?
BILL => I give you my word of honor, I will start nothing.
L.F. => Good enough for me. 
ALBURT => Miss O'Boyle required a two-hundred dollar membership fee.
BILL => That's rather pricey.
ALBURT => You wanna play for free, go to Vegas. You start now you'll be there by sundown.
BILL => I think I'll stay here. I'm thirsty.
ALBURT => That way.
BILL => Beer.
BARTENDER => Twenty dollars.
BILL => Twenty dollars for a beer?
BARTENDER => High cost of living shooter. You don't like it, go to Vegas. You can
BILL => What am I going to do, I'm thirsty.  Pour the beer.
BILL =>  I don't get that?
BILL => Cheers.
L.F. => Gentlemen, let's    see if the new kid in school wants    to play right away.  How bout it new    kid, you wanna handle my bones,    or do you just like to watch?
BILL => I came to play.
L.F. => Boys take a look at this man, he's what Webster's calls, a gambler. The dice belong to you , sir.
L.F. => I hope you're not implying anything, friend?
BILL =>  I'm not implying anything.
ALBURT => That did it fuckhead, you're out the door --
BILL => You looked me over when I stood in your doorway. I'm looking you over as I step up to your table. If I don't know, I don't throw.
L.F. => Are you satisfied?
BILL => More or less.
L.F. => I think we're getting into a antagonistic relationship.
BILL => Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were trying to take my money, and I was trying to take yours.
L.F. => It's just a game.
BILL => If you're game, take my bet sportsman.
L.F. => Covered.
BILL => Shoot it all.
L.F. => Covered.
L.F. => The point is five, gentlemen, five is the point.
BILL => Shoot it all.
L.F. => Covered.
BILL => Shoot it all.
L.F. => Pretty lucky tonight, huh?
BILL => Play a game of luck long enough you're bound to meet some lucky people.
L.F. => You know we've never been properly introduced, I'm L.F. O'Boyle.
BILL => And I'm not interested.
L.F. => No, you're rude. Why so rude rude boy, I'm only trying to be friendly.
BILL => I didn't come here to make friends. I came here to shoot a little crap. But then your boy over there hits me up for a two hundred dollar privilege to play fee --
L.F. => -- That's a membership fee, good for --
L.F. => So that's your game, you want to teach me a lesson?
BILL => I wanna    burn you    down. When I'm through    with you,    you won't have a pot to    piss, or a    window to throw it out    of. You'll    thumb a ride out of L.A.    wearing a    barrel.
L.F. => I could always save myself this horrible fate by not taking your bet.
BILL => To be replaced by a different fate. The embarrassing truth that you run a gutless game. I won't forget it. I'm sure these gentlemen won't forget it. I'm sure they'll tell people who won't forget it. And we won't come back. If we don't come back, you won't get our money. Couple of weeks, you won't have a game.
L.F. => You got a big mouth, lucky boy. And the idea of taking everything you've won away, and sending you out the door with nothing but a red face, is so appealing to me, that I will take your bet. But.....not with those dice.
L.F. => The house's perogative and you know it.
L.F. => Maybe you would like to change your bet?
BILL => Yes I would.....Shoot it all.....Against myself.
L.F. => What?
BILL => Did I stutter, I'm changing my bet. I'm betting I don't make it.
ALBURT => You can't do that.
BILL => Oh yes I can. It's the shooter's perogative, and she knows it.
L.F. => Covered.
BILL => Can I use your phone?
L.F. => Sure it's next to the bed.
L.F. => Game's over, get out! Get the fuck out! No more tonight, go home....
BILL =>  Vernita's dead? When?  What about her family?  Nice to see Kiddo hasn't gone completely apeshit. No idea where she is?  Okay that did it, we're going to Texas and talk sense into Budd before  makes him number three.
BILL => We're going to have a talk about this later. 
BILL => Got a nose problem?
L.F. => I said you could use my phone. I didn't say I wouldn't listen.
BILL => This is true.
L.F. => You didn't burn me down you know?
BILL => Course not. First rule of any house, ya gotta have LUCKY GUY comes in and wipes the place out insurance.
L.F. => If there weren't losers it wouldn't be a game.
BILL => I sincerely hope you mean that.
THE BRIDE => What L.F. O'Boyle didn't know was, the real game was just beginning. Bill was on the job, and she was the target. Now Bill was the greatest assassin of the 20th century. In fact the term HITMAN was coined for him. And he rarely performs actual assassinations anymore. However every once in awhile - to keep his hand in - he does. Only he plays a game. He doesn't start big trouble...he lets them start it. If they do, they're dead. If they don't, not only won't he perform, he'll take the hit off the market. It's kind of fun watching people gamble when they don't know they're gambling, isn't it?
L.F. => Get my money back. Don't kill him. Chop off all his fingers.
BILL => Do you know a Jessica?
BILL => Well, she knows you.
BLACK FRAME => TITLE CARD:
BUDD => Great day in the morning. Brother Bill livin up to his familia obligation.
BILL => How ya doin' Budd?
BUDD => Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a mad rush of wild parties and wealthy women.
BUDD => Is that that tall blonde one-eyed Viking bitch in the passenger seat?
BILL => It's Elle. Want to say hello?
BUDD => Never said "bye," can't seem to think of a reason to say, "hi."
BUDD => What'd ya wanna talk about?
BILL => Are you not going to invite me in?
BUDD => No.
BILL => May I ask why not?
BUDD => It stinks in there, that's why. Now what's so important it requires a reunion?
BUDD => You tryin to tell me she cut her way through eighty-eight bodyguards 'fore she got to O-Ren?
BILL => No. There wasn't really eighty eight of them, they just called themselves The Crazy 88.
BUDD => Why.
BUDD => She got 'er a Hattori Hanzo sword?
BILL => She has a Hanzo Jingi sword.
BUDD => He made her one? Didn't he swear a blood oath never to make another sword?
BILL => It would appear he's broken it.
BUDD => Them Japs know how to carry a grudge don't they? Or is it just you tend to bring that out in people?
BILL =>  I know this is a ridiculous question before I ask, but you by any chance haven't kept up with your swordplay?
BUDD => Hell, I pawned that years ago.
BILL => You pawned a Hattori Hanzo sword?
BUDD => Yep.
BILL => It was priceless.
BUDD => Not in El Paso it ain't. In El Pso I got me 250 Dollars for it.
BILL => Since it was a gift from me, why didn't you offer me the chance to buy it back?
BUDD => Because that would've required me to acknowledge your existence. Drunken bum though I may be, I don't need booze that bad. But who the hell gives a crap anyway. That bitch ain't gittin no Bushido points for killin a white trash piece of shit like me with a samurai sword. I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill. If she wants to fight me, all she gotta do is come down to the Club, start some shit, and we'll be in a a fight.
BILL => -- Budd, you need to listen to me. I know we haven't spoken for quite some time, and the last time we spoke wasn't the most pleasant. But you need to get over being mad at me, and start becoming afraid of Bea. Because she is coming, and she's coming to kill you. And unless you accept my assistance, I have no doubt she will succeed.
BILL => Can't we forget the past, and look at the happy side of all this?
BUDD => And what would that happy side be?
BILL => She's brought "the boys" back together.
BUDD => I appreciate the concern on your face, but there's a difference 'tween "the boys", time can't erase. I don't dodge guilt. And I don't Jew outta payin my comeuppance. That woman deserves her revenge. And we deserve to die. But then again, so does she. So I guess we'll just see now, won't we.
TED => You're late, Budd, this shit ain't school, ya know.
STRIPPER => Hey, Budd.
BUDD => Hey, Lucky.
STRIPPER => Hey, Budd, honey, the toilet's at it again. There's shitty water all over the floor.
BUDD => I'll take care of it, Suzie Pie.
The BRIDE => sits behind the wheel, looking at the bar and the bar's front door. Using the rearview as a mirror, she grabs her long blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a rubberband. Then places a baseball cap on the top of her noggin that reads, "STUBB'S BAR B-Q." She steps out of the truck's cab. She's dressed like a little Texas two-stepper. Levi's, cowboy boots, and a "HARLEY DAVIDSON: LOUD AND PROUD" tee-shirt.
THE BRIDE => Shiner.
The BRIDE => standing in the doorway is HIT SMACK DAB in the chest, and PROPELLED THROUGH the AIR BACKWARDS.
BUDD'S POV => The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from her throat.
BUDD => Bet your sweet ass that don't sting like a bitch.
BUDD => ...But I don't wont to neather.
BUDD => Now I know when it    comes to a rock salt burn, you're    feelin pretty much like a expert    bout now. But truth be told, you    ain't felt all rock salt's got to    offer till you took a double dose    in your backside.
BUDD => That gentled ya down, didn't it? Yep...ain't nobody a badass with two barrels of rock salt dug deep in their backyard.
ELLE => Bill?
BUDD => Wrong brother, you hateful bitch.
ELLE => ....Budd?
BUDD => Bingo.
ELLE => And what do I owe this dubious pleasure?
BUDD => I just caught me the cowgirl, ain't never been caught.
ELLE => Do you mean what I think you mean?
BUDD => If you think I mean I got 'er, you thought right.
ELLE => Did you kill her?
BUDD => Not yet I ain't. But I can sure do it easy enough. She's so gentle right now, I could preform her coup de grace with a rock.
ELLE => What are you waiting for, run outta liquid courage.
BUDD => No. It's just...I ain't killed nobody in a long Goddamn time. And just 'tween you, me, and Jesus Christ, kinda made me a promise I wasn't gonna. Be that however it is. Back when I did kill people...I got paid for it. Just don't seem right...turn amateur this time of life.
BUDD => Anywho, guess what I'm holdin in my hand right now.
BUDD => A brand spankin new Hattori Hanzo sword. And I'm here to tell ya Elle, that's what I call sharp.
ELLE => How much?
BUDD => Oh, that's hard to say. Seein it's priceless and all.
ELLE => I'll give you a hundred thousand dollars for it.
BUDD => I'm sure you would. But I'll take, one million.
ELLE => Jeez Budd, who'd ever guess you were such a capitalist. I thought drunks like yourself were beyond such monetary concerns?
BUDD => Well Elle, a million dollars buys a whole lotta Jack.
ELLE => Why then are you selling it to a hateful bitch like me, when you know Bill would pay more?
BUDD => If I'm gonna drink myself to death, ...it won't be on Bill's dollar. It's gonna be on yours.
ELLE => What's the terms?
BUDD => You buy a ticket to Texas, and I'll see you here tomorrow mornin. You give me a million in foldin cash, I'll give you the greatest sword ever made by a man. How's that sound?
ELLE => Sounds like we got a deal. One
BUDD => What?
ELLE => You kill her tonight.  And one more thing.
BUDD => You said one condition.
ELLE => It's a caveat to the same condition.
BUDD => What?
ELLE => She must suffer to her last breath.
BUDD => That Elle darlin, I can pretty damwell guarantee.
ELLE => Then I'll see you in the morning millionaire.
WITH SHOVELS => digging up a grave. Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot too. Its headlight beams shining on the two men. And last but not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed
The BRIDE => She begins to come to from the shot in her arm. Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds her wrists tightly together in front of her.
BUDD => Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.
dup up. => Next to it is a brand new pine box coffin, straight out of
BUDD => Look at those eyes. This bitch is furious. You grab her feet, I'll get her head.  Got anything to say?
BUDD => In America white women call this the silent treatment.  And we let 'em think, we don't like it.
BUDD => Hey hey hey, wiggle worm, look at this.
BUDD => Looky here bitch, this is a can of mace. Now you're goin underground tonight, and that's all there is to it. But, when I bury ya, I was gonna bury you with this.
BUDD => But if    you're gonna act like    a horse's    ass, I'll spray this    whole Goddamn    can in your eyeballs.     Then you'll    be blind, burnin, and    buried alive.    So what's it gonna be sister?
BUDD => You may be stupid, but at least you ain't bloody stupid.
THE BRIDE => Help me.
THE BRIDE => Well, now that you've had a nice, good cry, let's figure out how to get out of here? You're breathing like you just been fuckin. Calm down...close your mouth, and start breathing short breaths, through your nose.
THE BRIDE => That's a lot better. But you're still too agitated. Can you hear your heart? It's like I'm buried alive with Buddy Rich. Turn off that flashlight.
THE BRIDE => No! I can't turn off the light. Yes you can. The darkness will have a calming effect. Now turn off that fucking light.
BUDD =>  Yellow?
ELLE => Didja do it?
BUDD => Elle darlin, she's sufferin as we speak.
BLACK FRAME => TITLE APPEARS:
BILL => Once upon a time in China, some believe around the year, one-double knot-three.
BILL => ...head priest of The White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the road, contemplating whatever a man with Pai Mei's infinite power would contemplate -- Which is another way of saying, who knows. When, a Shaolin monk appeared on the road traveling in the opposite direction. As the monk and the priest crossed paths...Pai Mei -- in a practically unfathomable display of generosity, gave the monk the slightest of nods. The nod, was not returned. Was it the intention of the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just fail to see the generous social gesture? The motives of the monk, remain, unknown. What is known, were the consequences. The next morning Pai Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple, and demanded that the temple's head Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to repay the insult. The Abbot, at first, tried to console Pai Mei, only to find, Pai Mei was inconsolable. So began, the massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and all sixty of the monks inside, at the fists of the White Lotus. And so began, the legend of Pai Mei's Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart Technique.
THE BRIDE => What praytell, is a ten-point palm - exploding heart technique?
BILL => Quite simply, the deadliest blow in all of the martial arts. He hits you with his fingertips, at ten different pressure points on your body. And then, he lets you walk away. But once you've taken five steps, your heart explodes inside your body, and you fall to the floor dead.
THE BRIDE => Did he teach you that?
BILL => No. He teaches no one the ten-point palm - exploding heart technique. But he is Nietzsche's psalm personified. If Pai Mei doesn't kill you, he will make you stronger. Now one of the things I always liked about you, Kiddo, is you appear wise beyond your years. Then allow me to impart, a word to the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER - Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash him - even for an instant - a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out. And if you throw any American sass his way, he will snap your back and your neck like they were twigs, and that will be the story of you.
BILL => He'll accept you as his student.
THE BRIDE => Caught him in a good mood, aye?
BILL => More like a sadistic one.
BILL => Just seeing those steps again makes me ache. You're gonna have plenty of fun carrying buckets of water up and down that fucker.
THE BRIDE => Why did he accept me?
BILL => Because he's a very very very old man. And like all rotten bastards, when they get old, they become lonely. Not that that has any effect on their disposition. But they do learn the value of company.
THE BRIDE => When will I see you again?
BILL => That's the title of my favorite soul song of the Seventies.
THE BRIDE => What?
BILL => Nothing. When he tells me you're done.
THE BRIDE => When do you think that might be?
BILL => That my dearest, all depends on you. Now remember, no backtalk, no sarcasm. Least not for the first year. You're going to have to let him warm up for you. He hates Caucasians, despises Americans, and has nothing but contempt for women, so in your case, that may take a little while. Adios.
THE BRIDE =>  Hello!
PAI MEI => Up the stairs, yankee woman!
THE BRIDE =>  More stairs, Jesus Christ.
PAI MEI => If it is Christ you seek, turn back now.

PAI MEI => Impressive.

BUDD => Want some breakfast?
ELLE => ...So that's called a Texas funeral?
BUDD => Yep.
ELLE => I got to give it to ya Budd, that's a pretty fucked up way to die. What's the name on the grave she's buried under?
BUDD => Paula Schultz.
BUDD => That's my money in that black case, isn't it?
ELLE => Sure is.
BUDD => Well then, it's your sword now.
ELLE => So this, is a Hattori Hanzo sword.
BUDD => That's a Hanzo sword alright.
ELLE => Bill tells me you once had one of your own.
BUDD => Once.
ELLE => How does this one compare to that one?
BUDD => If you're gonna compare a Hanzo sword, you compare it to every
BUDD => So, which "R" you filled with?
ELLE => What?
BUDD => They say the number one killer of old people is retirement. People got'em a job to do, they tend to live a little longer so they can do it. I've always figured warriors and their enemies share the same relationship. So now you ain't gonna hafta face your enemy on the battlefield no more, which "R" are you filled with, Relief or Regret?
ELLE => A little bit of both.
BUDD => Bullshit. I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both. But I know damn well you feel one more than you feel the other. The question was which one?
ELLE => Regret.
BUDD => Yeah you gotta hand it to the ol' girl. I never saw nobody buffalo Bill the way she buffaloed Bill. Bill useta think she was so damn smart. I tried to tell him... Bill, she's just smart for a blonde.
ELLE => Want your money?
BUDD => Great day in the morning.
ELLE => Oh, I'm sorry Budd, that was rude of me wasn't it? Budd -- I'd like to introduce my friend, The Black Mamba. (gesturing towards the refridgerator) Black Mamba -- this is Budd. You know before I picked up that little fella, I looked him up on the internet. (she removes her notepad from her pocket)
ELLE => Now in these last agonizing minutes of life you have left, let me answer the question you asked earlier, more thoroughly. When it comes to that bitch, I gotta lotta "R's" in me. Revenge is one. Retribution is another. Rivalry is definitely one. But I got another
ELLE =>  Bill...Elle. I have some tragic news.  Your brother's dead.  I'm sorry baby.
ELLE => She put a Black Mamba in his camper.  I got her, sweety.  She's dead.  Let me put it this way. If you ever start feeling sentimental, go to Austin, Texas. When you get here, walk into a florist and buy a bunch of flowers. Then you take those flowers to Huntington cemetery on Fuller and Guadalupe, look for the headstone marked "Paula Schultz", then lay them on the grave. Because you will be standing at the final resting place of BEATRIX KIDDO.
FLASH ON => CLASSROOM of 1st Graders on the first day of class.

FLASH ON => EX CU Her EYE.
The BRIDE => searching the camper.
FLASH ON => EX CU The BRIDE'S EYE.
The BRIDE => searching under his bed, she sees a sword on the floor, resting in a shiny, black wood mahagony sheath. She removes it from its hiding place.
WOOD SHEATH => Its one of Hanzo's sheaths. She opens it. It is a Hanzo sword. Near the handle, etched in the steel, are the English words; "To My Brother Budd, The Only Man I Ever Loved, from Bill."
ELLE => Bravo, Bea. I actually thought that alacky had got the best of you.
THE BRIDE => You thought wrong.
ELLE =>  What's that?
THE BRIDE => Budd's Hanzo sword.
ELLE => He said he pawned it.
THE BRIDE => Guess that makes him a liar, don't it?
THE BRIDE =>  Elle?
ELLE =>  Bea.
THE BRIDE => I was wondering, just 'tween us girls, what did you say to Pai Mei for him to snatch out your eye?
ELLE => I called him a bastard.
THE BRIDE => Oooh, not so good.
ELLE => Were I to do it over again, I'd bite my tongue.
THE BRIDE => One more question?
ELLE => Shoot.
THE BRIDE => Where's Bill?
ELLE => Villa Quatro.
THE BRIDE => Gulf of Mexico?
THE BRIDE => You wouldn't lie to me now?
ELLE => Why lie?
THE BRIDE => I saw what you did to that little Mamba in there. Want to try that on somebody your own size?
ELLE => I intend to.
THE BRIDE => Oh    Elle,   I    should warn   you    before we get started. Hattori Hanzo swords are extremely sharp. They can    take   a    little   getting    used   to. Careful not to cut your own arm off.
ELLE => I don't rattle, bitch!
THE BRIDE => You're gonna bleed though, you're gonna bleed a lot.

BILL =>  Yes, I got to go and meet the Duchess.  Do you like it?
JOSEPHINA => Oh yes Mr. Bill, it's very pretty.
BILL => Why don't you put it on the dinner table, so we can enjoy it tonight.
JOSEPHINA =>  Good idea, she'll love it.
BILL => Oh and Josephina, take the remaining flowers and spread them around the house, if you would.
JOSEPHINA => Yes, Mr. Bill.
BILL => You know I just had a great idea. Take the roses, and spread the petals on the bed I just got for her. That'd be a nice thing to come home to, wouldn't it, a bed of roses.
JOSEPHINA => Oh, she'll love that Mr. Bill.
BILL => You wouldn't mind doing that for me, would you Josephina?
JOSEPHINA => No, not at all.

CU BILL => driving as the Spanish love song plays.

WIDE SHOT => looking through the Institution's glass wall. The elevator in the lobby opens...and A LITTLE GIRL steps out, and runs into Bill's arms. A LITTLE GIRL about five years old. A FIVE-YEAR OLD LITTLE GIRL with blonde hair. Bill picks up the Little Girl and lifts her HEAD into the CROSSHAIRS of the SCOPE SIGHT.
FLASH ON => The Bride remembering, while she was in her wide-eyed coma state, lying on an operating table, as DOCTORS AND NURSES performed a Cesarean childbirth on her. The NEWBORN INFANT is passed to other hands above her wide-eyed unblinking expressionless face.
BILL => Hola.
THE BRIDE => Hello Bill.
BILL => Kiddo, is that really you?
THE BRIDE => Oh, it's me all right.
BILL => I hear you were driving a truck?
THE BRIDE => My pussy wagon died on me. Who's your little friend?
BILL => Oh, you mean the little tow head next to me, who looks extraordinarily like you?
THE BRIDE => Yeah, that one.
BILL => Her name is B.B.
THE BRIDE => B.B.?
BILL => Yes. Do you approve?
THE BRIDE => Yes. Can she hear us?
BILL => Not now, she's in dream land.
THE BRIDE => How old is she?
BILL => What do you mean by that?
THE BRIDE => How many years has she been alive?
BILL => Don't ask how old she is, ask, if she's five.
THE BRIDE => Is she five?
BILL => Aren't mothers like God, aren't you supposed to automatically know?
THE BRIDE => I did and I do.  I want to meet her.
BILL => Have dinner with us at my hacienda tonight. She's expecting you.
THE BRIDE => What do you mean?
BILL => I knew you were on your way, so I told B.B. Her mommy was coming to see her.
THE BRIDE =>  What have you told her about me?
BILL => That you were sick, that you were asleep, but one day you'd wake up and come back to her. And she asked me, "If Mommy's been asleep since I was born, how will she know what I look like?" To which I replied, "Because Mommy's been dreaming of you." And she said, "Then I'm gonna start dreaming of her." So I gave her a
THE BRIDE => -- which one?
BILL => The one I took of you in Paris, sitting on the steps with the baguette in your hand. Since she was one and a half years old, she's slept with that picture of you next to her bed.
THE BRIDE => You know, prettier photos of me do exist.
BILL => And she's seen them. But the one she wants looking after her while she sleeps is the one of you holding bread.  We normally have dinner around seven, is that convenient?
THE BRIDE => Yes.
THE BRIDE => When do we cross swords?
BILL => Well, it just so happens, my hacienda comes with its very own private beach. And my private beach, just so happens to look particularly beautiful bathed in moonlight. And there just so happens to be a full moon out tonight. So, swordfighter, if you
THE BRIDE => Do me a courtesy?
BILL => Anything.
THE BRIDE => Slow down as we pass...I want another look at her.
BILL => Wear something nice tonight?
THE BRIDE => I have a dress all picked out.
BILL => Will I like it?
THE BRIDE => You said I looked beautiful last time you saw me in it.
BILL => I'll dress up too.
THE BRIDE => You fucking maricone!
BILL => Now you just wait one second there little missy. Unless I'm confused, we are trying to kill each other aren't we? Now I wasn't planning on taking a shot at you in front of the squirt, but, she is asleep. And if you're gonna forget everything I ever taught you, and gawk like you ain't got good sense, I'm gonna take a shot, am I not?
THE BRIDE => Did she wake up?
BILL => Of course not. She's like you that way. I look forward to this evening. It was great speaking with you, Bea.
HANZO =>  Hello....
THE BRIDE => Hattori!
HANZO => Beatrix, what's wrong?
THE BRIDE => She's alive! My baby girl's alive!
HANZO => Half of Bill's strength, lies in his talent for the unexpected. If you intend to vanquish this man, and claim your daughter, you must not only expect the unexpected. You must do the unexpected.
THE BRIDE => Hello Manny.
THE BRIDE => Hello Josephina.
JOSEPHINA => Hello Miss Beatrix.
THE BRIDE => Stay in here and don't come out. If you leave this room I'll shoot you, comprende?
JOSEPHINA => Yes.
BILL => Kiddo! If you're through shooting the servants, I'm in the living room. You remember how to get to the living room, don'tcha? Go down to the end of the hall, and make a left.
BILL =>  Bang Bang!
BILL => Oh B.B., Mommy got us.
BILL => Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...
B.B. => Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...
BILL => Fall down sweetheart, Mommy shot you.
BILL => You did it Quick Draw Kiddo. You are-the fastest.
BILL => But...little did Quick Draw Kiddo know,...that five-year-old B.B. Gunn was only playing possum, due to the fact she was impervious to bullets.
BILL =>  Hey, get back down there, you're playing possum.
BILL => So, as the smirking killer approached, what she thought, was a bullet-ridden corpse,...that's when the little B.B. Gunn fired.
B.B. => Bang bang!
BILL => Mommy, you're dead - so die.
THE BRIDE => Oh, B.B., you got me. I should have known, you are the best.
B.B. => Don't die Mommy, I was just playing.
MOMMY => I know baby.
B.B. => I waited a long time for you to wake up, Mommy. Did you dream of me - I dreamed of you?
THE BRIDE => Every single night, baby.
THE BRIDE => Now let me look at you. My my my... What a pretty girl you are.
B.B. => You're pretty too, Mommy.
THE BRIDE => Thank you.
BILL => When I showed you Mommy's picture, tell Mommy what you said.
B.B. => I said - I said - You're the most beautiful woman I ever saw in the whole white world.
BILL => That's the truth. That's what she said.
B.B. => What's that?
MOMMY => Oh, Mommy spilled something on her dress.
B.B. => Blood?
MOMMY => No. Kool-Aid. Do you like Kool-Aid?
B.B. => No.
BILL => Do you not like it, or do you not know what it is?
B.B. => I do not know what it is.
MOMMY => Well, it's a very tasty beverage that I used to drink, when I was a little girl. It comes in a lot of different flavors and colors, and it's really good. Maybe we should fix some sometime. Want to do that?
BILL => Speaking of fixing and drinking and eating, I think it's dinner time don't you?
BILL =>  When you were doin all that fancy shootin, you didn't happen to shoot a nice Mexican woman about forty five years old, did ya?
MOMMY => No.
BILL =>  Josephina! You can come out now, we're ready for dinner.
JOSEPHINA => Yes, Mr. Bill.
BILL => Want to go on top of the world?
B.B. => Yeah!
BILL => B.B., don't you think Mommy has the prettiest hair in the whole wide world?
B.B. => Yes I do.
BILL => In fact it's better than pretty. What's better than pretty?
B.B. => Gorgeous.
BILL => Very good, gorgeous. Mommy is gorgeous.
BILL => You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.
BILL => I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad daddy.  Our little girl learned about life and death the other day.  You want to tell Mommy about what happened to Emilio?
B.B. => I killed him. I didn't mean to, but I stepped on him and he stopped moving.
BILL => Emilio was her goldfish. She came running into my room holding the fish in her hand, crying, "Daddy daddy, Emilio's dead." And I said, "Really, that's so sad. How did he die?" And what did you say?
B.B. => I stepped on him.
BILL => Actually young lady, the words you so strategically used were, "I accidentally stepped on him." Right?
B.B. => Yeah.
BILL => To which I queried, "And just how did your foot accidentally find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?" And she told me no no no, Emilio was on the carpet when she stepped on him.  Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And just how did Emilio get on the
B.B. => He was -- flapping.
BILL => And then you stomped on him?
B.B. => Uh-huh.
BILL => And when you lifted your foot up, what was Emilio doing then?
B.B. => Nothing.
BILL => He stopped flapping, didn't he?
B.B. => Uh-huh.
BILL => And you knew what that meant, didn't you?
B.B. => Uh-huh.
BILL => What did that mean?
B.B. => He was dead.
BILL =>  She told me later, that the second she lifted up her foot and saw him not flapping, she knew he was dead. Is that not the perfect visual image of life and death? A fish flapping on the carpet, and a fish not flapping on the carpet. So powerful even a five-year old child with no concept of life and death knew what it meant. Not only did she know Emilio was dead, she knew she had killed him. So she comes running into my room, holding Emilio in both of her little hands - it was so cute - and she wanted me to make Emilio better. And I asked her, why did she step on Emilio? And she said, she didn't know. But I knew why. You didn't mean to hurt Emilio, you just wanted to see what would happen if you stepped on him, right?
B.B. => Uh-huh.
BILL => And what happens when you stomp on Emilio, is you kill him. And you discovered that, didn't you?
B.B. => Uh-huh.
BILL => So we drove down to the beach, had a little funeral, and gave Emilio a burial at sea. And right now I'm sure he's happy as can be, swimmin around in fish heaven. But the point being, our child learned two very important lessons. One, about life and death. The other, somethings once you do, they
she felt =>  You loved Emilio, didn't you?
B.B. => Uh-huh.
BILL => Well sweety, I love Mommy, but I did to Mommy what you did to Emilio.
B.B. => You stomped on Mommy?
BILL => Worse.  I shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot, like we were just doing. I shot her for real.
B.B. => Why?
BILL => I don't know.
B.B. => Did you want to see what would happen?
BILL => No, I   knew what   would happen to Mommy   if I shot   her. What I didn't know,   is when I   shot Mommy, what would   happen to   me.
B.B. => What happened?
BILL => I was very sad. And that was when I learned, somethings once you do, they can never be undone.
B.B. => What happened to Mommy?
BILL => Why don't you ask Mommy.
B.B. => Are you okay Mommy. Does it hurt?
BILL => No sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore.
B.B. => Did it make you sick?
MOMMY => It put me to sleep. That's why I haven't been with you B.B., I've been asleep.
B.B. => But you're awake now, right?
MOMMY => I'm wide awake, pretty girl.
BILL => Did she go to sleep easy?
THE BRIDE => It took her a little bit. She was excited. She's quite the little chatterbox.
BILL => Well, if she doesn't like you, you got to kill her to say hello. But if she likes you, you can't shut her up. She's a chip off the ole blonde in that regards.
BILL => Red wine?
BILL => C'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more fun with a couple glasses of wine in ya.
BILL =>  We're going to go out there and have at it, aren't we?
BILL => Well, I've already had    a glass. So unless you want to win    by an unfair advantage, you should    have a glass of wine. So we're both    on the same footing wine wise.
BILL => You know, there's an old man down here, his name is Esteban Viharo. He was a pimp. I knew him when I was a child. He was a friend of my mother's. I told him about you. When I showed him your picture he smiles and said;  "Yesss, I see the attraction." He told me a story about taking me to the movies when I was five. It was a movie which had Lana Turner in it. And whenever she would appear on screen, he said I would stick my thumb in my mouth and suck it, to an obscure amount. And he knew right then, this boy will be a fool for blondes.
THE BRIDE => Who would of ever thought you'd be such a good father?
BILL => Well not you, that's for damn sure.
THE BRIDE => Must we have to endure your little zingers?
BILL => No we mustn't. But if you're going to say sentences like that, in the future, I will resist the temptation.
THE BRIDE => Baby, you don't have a future.
BILL => I sent you to L.A. and you never came back. I thought you'd been killed. Do you know how cruel it is to make someone think someone they love is dead? I mourned you. Then in the third month of my mourning, I track you down. I wasn't trying to track you down, I was trying to track down - the fucking assholes - who I thought killed you. And when I find you, what to I find? Not only are you not dead, you're getting married - to some fuckin jerk - and you're pregnant? How do you expect me to react?
THE BRIDE => Why do you think I hid?
BILL => Why did you leave in the first place? You have cold eyes towards me now. I understand their temperature, but they were warm the second to the last time I saw them, or was that just my imagination?
THE BRIDE => No.
THE BRIDE => You sent me to L.A. to kill that lady scoundrel, Lisa Wong.
BILL => You are you talking in Japanese?
THE BRIDE => What the hell do you care what I talk in? Don't you know when to keep your mouth shut? I'm trying to tell you what you want to know, if you'll just shut up and listen and stop talking! Now may I continue?
BILL => You're right, I'm wrong, continue.
THE BRIDE => The morning I left, I threw up. I don't feel like speaking in Japanese anymore - on the plane, I threw up. When I got to my hotel, I threw up. So naturally I started thinking, maybe I might be pregnant. So I bought one of those home pregnancy kits. Went back to my room and took the test. The little strip said blue. I was going to have a baby. I tried to call you, but you weren't there, so I just thought I'd call back later.
BILL => But you never did.
THE BRIDE => - Would you shut up, I'm trying to tell you how I feel.
BILL => My apologies, please continue.
THE BRIDE => So I just figured I'd call you back later. I was just so happy, I put on music and danced by myself in the hotel suite, holding my little blue strip. What I didn't know, was at some leg of my journey, I was spotted. With me in Los Angeles it didn't take Lisa Wong long to figure out someone put a hit out on her. So she sent an assassin of her own to
THE BRIDE => Hello, can I help you?
HOTEL WOMAN => Hello, I'm Karen Kim, I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel. I have a welcome gift from the management.
THE BRIDE => Oh, it's beautiful. But I'm kinda busy at this second, could you possibly come back later?
KAREN => So you came here to kill Lisa Wong, huh? Well that's my sister, bitch. I'm Karen Wong, and I've come here to kill you.
THE BRIDE => Wait a second!
THE BRIDE => Yes, I'm an assassin. Yes I did come here to kill your sister. But I'm not gonna do that now.
KAREN => Oh, I know you're not --
THE BRIDE => - listen to me! I just found out, right now - not two minutes before you blew a hole in the door, I'm pregnant.
THE BRIDE => On that table is the    home pregnancy kit. On the floor by    the door is the strip that says    I'm pregnant. I'm telling you the    truth, I don't want to and I won't    kill your sister. I just want    to go home.
KAREN => What is this, bullshit story number twelve in the female assassin's handbook?
THE BRIDE => Any other time you'd be a hundred percent right. But this time you're a hundred percent wrong. I'm the deadliest woman in the world, but right now I'm scared shitless for my baby. Please, you hafta believe me. Look at the strip, it's on the floor.
KAREN => Sit down on that bed and put your hands behind your head.
THE BRIDE => Blue means pregnant.
KAREN => I'll read it myself, thank you.
KAREN => Okay, say I were to believe you, what then?
THE BRIDE => Just go home. I'll do the same.
KAREN => You fucked with the Wong sisters.
THE BRIDE => Facing Karen Wong, was the most frightening moment I have ever experienced. And that includes three years with that evil bastard Pai Mei. Before that strip turned blue, I was a woman, I was your woman. I was a killer, who killed for you. Before that strip turned blue, I would have jumped a motorcycle on to a speeding train ...for you. But once that strip turned blue, I could no longer do any of those things. Not anymore. Because now I was a mother. A mother who only had one thought on her mind. Please don't harm my baby. Can you understand that?
BILL => Yes. But why tell me now, and not then?
THE BRIDE => You wouldn't have let me go. Specially once you found out I was pregnant. You would've tried to talk me out of it. It would have been a big scene. I just said fuck it.
BILL => Fuck who?
THE BRIDE => Bill, you couldn't know I was pregnant, once you knew, you'd claim it, and I didn't want that.
BILL => That's not your decision to make.
THE BRIDE => Yes, but it's the right decision. And I made it for my daughter. Everybody on this earth deserves to start with a clean slate. But with us - my daughter would be born into a world she shouldn't be. Robbing her of the one thing everybody deserves. She would be born with blood stains. I had to choose. I chose her.
THE BRIDE => You know five years ago, if I had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen. You performing a coup de grace on me by bustin a cap in my crown, would be right at the top of the list.  I'd've been wrong, wouldn't I?
BILL => I'm sorry was that a question? Of impossible things that could never happen - yes in this instance you would have been wrong.
THE BRIDE => Well?
BILL => Well what?
THE BRIDE => Explain yourself.
BILL => I already have. When I told you the story of when I thought you were dead. Didn't you get how badly I felt?
THE BRIDE => You call that an explanation?
BILL => Well if that's too cryptic let's get literal.  There are consequences to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard. You experienced some of them.
THE BRIDE => You and I have unfinished business.
BILL => Baby, you ain't kidding.
BILL => You know how proud I am of you, don't you?
THE BRIDE => Yes.
BILL => You know I was rooting for you, don't you?
THE BRIDE => I figured.
BILL => You know on that beach out there I want you to be the victor?
BILL => You also know you're going to have to defeat me. I can't just give it to you, even though I want to.
THE BRIDE => It won't be necessary for you to give me anything. I've surpassed you. I'll take it.
BILL => Well, as they say in Missouri, show me.
The BRIDE => Breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her Hanzo sword in its sheath.

BILL =>  That's my girl.
THE BRIDE => Of course he did.
BILL => Why didn't you tell me?
THE BRIDE => I don't know...Because...I'm a...bad person.
BILL => No. You're not a bad person. You're a terrific person. You're my favorite person. But every once in awhile...you can be a real cunt.
