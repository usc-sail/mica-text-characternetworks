MARIA => Hey.     Are you okay?
MARIA => Peter?    What's the matter?
DOUG => Karen!
KAREN => I'll never get used to this.
DOUG => Maybe we should find a different train station.
KAREN => A public display of affection is considered rude in Japan.
2a                                                                 2a => OMITTED
KAREN => What's that?
DOUG => We walk past this temple every day, Karen --
KAREN => Yeah, but I've never seen this before.
KAREN => It's a Buddhist ritual. The incense smoke carries the prayers to the spirits of his ancestors, to help them remain at peace.
DOUG => It's amazing. You're like this infinite storehouse of wisdom. Or trivia. I'm not sure which.
KAREN => It's not trivia. It's what they believe. And it's far better, by the way, than your little pollution ritual.
KAREN => What?
DOUG => Nothing. I just -- I like that about you. You seem to be able to remember everything that's really important.
DOUG => Except the time.
KAREN => Oh, crap --
KAREN => C'mon, you're gonna be late.
KAREN => Uh-uh. Seven years of bad luck.  And I might have a vested interest in those years.
DOUG => Is that right?
KAREN => Maybe.
DOUG => Will I see you tonight?
KAREN => I'll call you when I get home.
DOUG => Fourteen.    I hate odd numbers.
2d                                                                2d => Through the front doors, we see Doug kiss Karen again.   They finally separate, and Doug walks off.
ALEX => Karen!
ALEX => Are you free this afternoon?
KAREN => I just came by to pick up some books I left here. I'm not scheduled to work today --
ALEX => I know. But are you free?    Do you have class?
KAREN =>  Just a test to study for.   Why?
ALEX => Your wish has been granted.
ALEX => It's Yoko's case, but she didn't show up for work this morning, and I can't reach her at home. She must be sick, or something. And she has the damn house key.
KAREN => What's this phrase?
ALEX => "Mild dementia with severe lethargy." Apparently she sleeps through most of the day. Her daughter-in-law doesn't work, so she'll probably be there.
ALEX => You're the one who's been bugging me about getting out there on your own. Besides, it's an English-only house.
ALEX => Here's the address. Use the wall chart if you need help -- and don't forget to bring a map.
ALEX => Don't worry Karen, you're ready.
4b                                                                4b => OMITTED
5a                                                                5a => Karen walks down the populated sidewalk, weaving through STREET VENDORS, and passing a large GROCERY STORE.
KAREN => Hello?   Mrs. Williams?
KAREN => Is anyone here?
8                                                                   8 => Karen stands in the doorway, surveying the room.   The place is in a complete state of disarray.
KAREN => Oh my God... are you alright? --
9                                                                   9 => Emma sits on the back porch, staring vacantly. But her expression isn't simply blank - there's an odd sadness there.
KAREN => Okay, Emma. Let's try again: my name is Karen. Do you remember? I'm from the Health Center. I'm substituting for Yoko, just for today.
KAREN => Looks like you need a new Band-Aid. How'd this happen, Emma?  Would you like a bath? Maybe that will help you feel better.
10                                                                10 => Karen turns on the water, puts the stopper over the drain.
KAREN => It's okay, Emma.
12                                                                12 => Karen uses a sponge to bathe Emma, her robe rolled to her waist. Emma stares absently at the sky.
KAREN => Nice one, Karen.
16                                                                 16 => Karen steps into the foyer with the vacuum cleaner. She looks up at A RAILING overhead. Some trash is visible sticking over the edge. Karen shakes her head:
KAREN => How did you get up there?
18                                                                18 => Karen steps into the hallway and listens.   There it is again, and this time there's no doubt --
KAREN =>  Hello?
19                                                                19 => The sounds immediately stop as Karen enters the MASTER BEDROOM. It's dark, thick blinds covering the windows. A frosted window, overlooking the foyer, isn't helping much.
20                                                                20 => Karen is on her cell phone:
KAREN => Yes, he was shut in a closet! There was tape around the -- No, they're not home yet. I don't know, Emma hasn't said a word to me -- He's still upstairs -- yes, I'm sure he's Japanese -- But -- Yes, alright, Alex. Just please get here as soon as you can.
KAREN => Hello there.
Really creepy. => The boy just stares at her. KAREN My name is Karen. What's yours?
THE BOY => Toshio.
22                                                                 22 => Karen enters the room as the ANSWERING MACHINE picks up, the voices of a happy couple on the GREETING :
SUSAN => "Hey, guys, it's Susan. Matt, are you there? Pick up... 
SUSAN => Okay, well, I'm leaving work now so you can try my cell, or just call me at home later."
SUSAN => "I just wanted to make sure Mom is okay. Yesterday was... a bit weird, and -- I'm just a little worried."
SUSAN => "Listen, just give me a call when you can, okay?"
EMMA => ...I've told them over and over... I've told them over and over...
KAREN => Emma, who were you talking to?
EMMA => I just want her to leave me alone.
KAREN => You should get some rest, Emma.
24                                                                  24 => MATTHEW and his wife JENNIFER are in bed. He sleeps soundly, she doesn't. She's staring at the ceiling, listening to --
MATTHEW => You're up?
JENNIFER => Mmmmmm.
MATTHEW => I wonder if Mom's okay. She's been sleeping ever since we got here.
JENNIFER => Not at night.
JENNIFER => I told you, Matthew, you can sleep through anything.
MATTHEW => I'm sorry, sweetheart. It was probably just the move -- I'm sure she'll get back on schedule.
MATTHEW => You seen my travel mug?
JENNIFER => I didn't unpack it yet.
MATTHEW => Maybe you should say something to the helper, what's her name?
JENNIFER => Yoko.
MATTHEW => Who knows? Maybe there's something she can suggest.
JENNIFER => Yeah.     Maybe.
MATTHEW => I miss seeing this every morning. No response from his wife. He turns to see Jennifer looking down at Emma through the window.
MATTHEW => Hey, kiddo. You okay?
JENNIFER => I went for a walk yesterday. Just to explore. I got lost and couldn't find anyone who could speak English, who could help me. I felt so... stupid.
MATTHEW => This will get easier soon, for Mom, for all of us. I promise.
JENNIFER => Or else?
MATTHEW => Or else I'll tell the company it's just not working out, and that we're going back to the States with or without my old job. They can get someone else to crunch their numbers.
MATTHEW => But until then -- promise me you'll give it a good try, okay Jen?
JENNIFER => Deal.
MATTHEW => Is this Yoko's bike?
JENNIFER => I think so.
MATTHEW => It's been here all night.
MATTHEW => I'll probably be home late, maybe around nine or so.
JENNIFER => I knew you'd forget.
JENNIFER => Dinner, your sister?    At seven?
MATTHEW => Oh yeah.   Right.
JENNIFER => You were going to cook. MATTHEW I have a big conference.    They usually run long.
JENNIFER => I'll do the shopping. Just call me if you're going to be late.
29                                                                29 => CLOSE ON the same package, a microwaveable soup bowl, now open with a spoon sticking out of it. Resting, with a glass of water, atop the kotatsu table.
JENNIFER => If you need something, all you have to do is say so --
JENNIFER => Who's -- who's there?
31                                                                  31 => Reaching the top, Jennifer catches a glimpse of a familiar BOY running into the FRONT ROOM.
MATTHEW =>  Sorry I'm late, it took awhile to wrap things up.
MATTHEW => Jen?   Susan?
33                                                                     33 => Matthew turns on the lights. The room has reverted to its messy state, even worse than before.
MATTHEW => What the hell? --
MATTHEW => Mom?   Are you alright?
MATTHEW => Where's Jennifer, Mom?
MATTHEW => Did Yoko come today, Mom? Remember? The pretty girl?
MATTHEW => Jen?   Are you up there?
MATTHEW => Dammit.
MATTHEW => Jennifer?    What is it --
MATTHEW => What's wrong? What happened???
MATTHEW => I'll... I'll call an ambulance...
36                                                              36 => Matthew runs into the kitchen grabbing A LARGE BOOK on one of the moving boxes. The Japanese equivalent of a YELLOW PAGES.
MATTHEW => Dammit!
MATTHEW => Jesus Christ...
MATTHEW => `Ambulance'... "kyukyusha".
MATTHEW => Who are you? What -- what are you doing here?
39                                                                   39 => The DOORBELL rings.   Then a few more times.
SUSAN => Hello?
SUSAN => You guys in the kitchen?
40                                                                   40 => Susan walks in, puts the wine on the table.     Looks around.
SUSAN =>  I thought you guys were gonna cook!
SUSAN => Hi, Mom.    How are you feeling?
SUSAN => I guess I came at a bad time, huh?
SUSAN => I'll give you guys one minute to finish whatever you're doing up there and get your butts down here.
SUSAN => I mean it, guys.
SUSAN => Well, I warned you. Prepare to be emotionally scarred.
SUSAN => Matthew!   Don't scare me like that!
SUSAN => What's going on?   Where's Jennifer?
MATTHEW => She went out. Something came up.
SUSAN => I hope she's not long.    I'm absolutely starving.
SUSAN => I knew it. You guys forgot to go shopping, didn't you?
MATTHEW => I'm sorry.     This is a bad time.
SUSAN => Are you okay? What's going on?
MATTHEW => You should go.
SUSAN => Did something happen?    What's --
MATTHEW => She doesn't love me... she never loved me...
SUSAN => What are you talking about?
SUSAN => Stop it, Matthew.
MATTHEW => Leave me alone.
SUSAN => Matthew, please --
MATTHEW =>  GO AWAY!!!
42                                                                42 => It's an overcast afternoon.  Swollen clouds hang low over The House. It looks a bit more imposing than usual.
SUSAN => This is Suzuki-san, he's the Real Estate broker.
MATTHEW => What did he say?
SUSAN => He said: "welcome to Tokyo". And that you must be very important to your company for them to rent this place for you.
SUSAN => Your shoes.
MATTHEW => Oh.    Right.
JENNIFER => Even in our own house?
SUSAN => Even in your own house.
44                                                                 44 => Suzuki opens the blinds, letting some light into the place. It's not helping much -- it's still pretty dreary.
MATTHEW => Isn't the layout great? Wait `till you see the back room. It's perfect for Mom -- she won't have to deal with the stairs.
MATTHEW => Her bed won't be here until next week, but we can put the mattress on the floor. What do you think?
SUSAN => He says no one has lived in this house for three years.
JENNIFER => Why?
SUZUKI =>  Ex-pen-sive.
MATTHEW => Where's Mom?
44a                                                            44a => Susan comes up the stairs, worried.
SUSAN => Mom?   Where are you?
MATTHEW => Did you get her?
SUSAN =>  Take a pill, will ya?
SUSAN => C'mon, Mom. You know what the doctor said about stairs.
MATTHEW => She okay?
SUSAN => Mom?   What is it?
46                                                                46 => Suzuki walks from the kitchen into the hallway, giving the place one final look-over.
MATTHEW => It's perfect. We'll take it.
SUSAN => Hey, guys, it's Susan. Matt, are you there? Pick up... Okay, well, I'm leaving work now so you can try my cell, or just call me at home later.
SUSAN => I just wanted to make sure Mom is okay. Yesterday was... 
SUSAN => a bit weird, and -- I'm just a little worried. Listen, just give me a call when you can, okay?
49a                                                               49a => The hallway is chilly -- Susan shivers. She's about to start walking down when she looks up, noticing THE LIGHTS at the top floor FLICKERING.
SUSAN =>  Is anybody there?
SUSAN => In the stairs... there was... something... a strange person... all the lights were going out...
SUSAN =>  Please. Help me.
GUARD => I'll take a look. Wait here.
54a                                                                54a => OMITTED

55                                                                 55 => Susan bursts out of the security room and runs through the empty lobby, towards the front doors.
SUSAN => Hello?
MATTHEW => It's me.
SUSAN => Matthew!   Are you alright?
MATTHEW => I'm downstairs. What number are you again?
SUSAN => 702.   I'll buzz you in.
SUSAN => I don't know what you're up to, but this is not cool --
62a                                                                  62a => -- slowly walks into THE KITCHEN. She reaches out and turns the faucet handle. Tightens it. The dripping stops.
SUSAN => Please... stop it...
66                                                                66 => Karen's CELL PHONE lays on the table in the foreground. Beyond is the hallway, and the front door.
ALEX => Karen?
IGARASHI => I can handle this myself, you know. It's just a routine call. I don't know why you wanted to come.
69                                                                69 => The house feels completely different: all the interior lights are on, a few POLICE OFFICERS mill about, two EMTs wheel EMMA'S BODY out the front door on a gurney.
NAKAGAWA => I am Detective Nakagawa. This is Detective Igarashi, my assistant.
ALEX => Is Karen okay?
NAKAGAWA => She is very shaken. We would like her to stay in the hospital tonight, under evaluation.
NAKAGAWA => Do you know these people?
ALEX => Matthew Williams, and his wife Jennifer. He's Emma's son, the woman Karen came here to see.
NAKAGAWA => When was the last time you saw him?
ALEX => I met them when they came to register. It's standard procedure, though the visits were arranged by his employer. He works at --
NAKAGAWA => We've spoken with his employer.   He did not show up for work today.
NAKAGAWA => If you could please come by tomorrow to make a statement, the address is there, at the bottom --
ALEX =>  Yoko.
NAKAGAWA => I'm sorry?
ALEX => Karen was a substitute -- Yoko is the girl who is normally in charge of Emma. She's also been missing from work.
NAKAGAWA => For how long?
ALEX => For the last two days.
ALEX => I think I saw her bike outside.
IGARASHI => That's Matthew's sister.
IGARASHI => This must be her.
NAKAGAWA => Call her at work, then at home. If no one answers, send someone to --
72                                                                  72 => Nakagawa and Igarashi enter from the hallway, followed by their men. They look up to the second floor.
NAKAGAWA => I need your flashlight.
IGARASHI => God!
IGARASHI => What the hell... what is going on?
IGARASHI => What is that?
76                                                                 76 => The POLICE CARS outside have attracted a small crowd.   The TWO BODIES are being loaded into a POLICE VAN.
CORONER => Who does this belong to?
NAKAGAWA => We don't know.
CORONER => I can use the blood to help identify the person.
NAKAGAWA => Is it possible that someone could live without... that?
CORONER => I certainly hope not.
IGARASHI => Someone just reported another death. It's not in our district... but I think we should check it out.
NAKAGAWA => Why?
IGARASHI => The cause of death is not clear... but it is the man who sold them this house.
77                                                                     77 => CLOSE ON the spinning wheels of a bicycle.      A familiar one.
78                                                                     78 => Yoko steps inside. She instinctively slips off her shoes. She calls out, in decent English:
YOKO => Hi, excuse me?
YOKO => Emma?   It's Yoko.   I'm coming in.
YOKO => Hi, Emma.    It's good to see you again.
YOKO => My name is Yoko.
YOKO => You should be in bed --
YOKO => You shouldn't be playing with this!
80                                                                80 => OMITTED

88                                                                  88 => Yoko's head appears. Then her shoulders.     She looks around, but can't see a thing in the darkness.
DOUG => It's okay.     I've got you.
DOUG => Your boss told me what happened. I'm sorry.
DOUG => I talked to your teachers. They said you can take as much time as you need. We could go to Kyoto for a weekend, see those temples you're always talking about.
KAREN => Running away won't help.
DOUG => There's nothing to run away from, Kat. No one blames you for what happened.
KAREN => I'm not even sure what did happen.
DOUG => You went to help someone who was, quite simply, beyond help.
KAREN => No, that's not what I mean...
KAREN => That house. There was something...
DOUG => Don't beat yourself up searching for a greater truth, Kat. An old woman passed away in her sleep. It's sad, but that's all it is --
KAREN => Is that how they said she died?
DOUG => I'm sorry this happened to you. But maybe, in a way, it will help you later. Death is an unfortunate but integral part of your future career. There's no avoiding it. Maybe now you'll be more... ready for it.
KAREN => I don't think I'll ever be ready for something like that.
NAKAGAWA => I'm sorry to disturb you, Miss Davies. I was wondering if you could answer some additional questions?
DOUG => I'm Doug.    Karen's boyfriend.
DOUG => You up for this?
KAREN =>  Why don't you find out when I can check out of here.
NAKAGAWA => How are you feeling?
KAREN => Okay.   Tired.
NAKAGAWA => You are an exchange student?  And you have been volunteering at the Health Center for...?
KAREN => Three months. I needed a social welfare credit.
NAKAGAWA => You said this was the first time you'd been in that house?
KAREN => Yes.
NAKAGAWA => About the Japanese boy you said you saw there --
KAREN => Did you find him?
NAKAGAWA => No, not yet. You said the boy had been taped into the closet?
KAREN => Yes, that's right. He was... holding a cat. A black cat.  There was a book in the closet, too. I think it was a journal.
NAKAGAWA => Did it belong to the boy?
KAREN => I don't think so. I think it belonged to a woman.
KAREN => The writing. It looked feminine.
KAREN => I left it on the kitchen table.
NAKAGAWA => I didn't see any book on the table. Perhaps someone moved it. Did you speak with the boy after you opened the closet?
KAREN => I asked him his name.   He said `Toshio'.
NAKAGAWA => One more question, please.
NAKAGAWA => We found this in the room where...
KAREN => This is him. This is the boy.
NAKAGAWA => Are you certain?
KAREN => Yes.   Positive.
KAREN => Detective Nakagawa?
KAREN => The whole time I was in that house, I felt something was... wrong.
KAREN => What happened there?
NAKAGAWA => The bodies of the son and daughter- in-law of the woman you were caring for were found in the attic.
NAKAGAWA => It seems that the son killed his wife, and then himself --
NAKAGAWA =>  Please excuse me for a moment.
90                                                                90 => IN THE HALLWAY:   the men speak with hushed voices.
IGARASHI => We checked the apartment of Susan, the sister. She wasn't there...
NAKAGAWA => Yes?
IGARASHI => The chain lock had been drawn from the inside. And the deadbolt. But we found no one in the apartment.
NAKAGAWA => Get the surveillance tapes from the office building.
IGARASHI => They were the first family to live in that house since the incident three years ago --
KAREN => Toshio...
92                                                                   92 => The place is quiet, completely deserted.    Except for --
ALEX => Yoko?
ALEX => What... What happened, Yoko?
ALEX => Say something, please...
NAKAGAWA => Hello?
OMITTED => 97                                                                97
NAKAGAWA => Have you determined a cause of death?
CORONER => Not yet. The blood on his body -- isn't his. It belongs to her.
NAKAGAWA => I don't understand. He killed Yoko, before he died?
CORONER => The jawbone you found in the attic yesterday with the American couple belongs to this girl. I estimate it was -- removed -- from her body two or three days ago.
IGARASHI => But I thought you said her body was found with this man, tonight. The Coroner nods.    Eyes on his shoes.
NAKAGAWA => Then how did she get from the house to the Health Center?
CORONER => I have no idea.
NAKAGAWA => She survived for two days without this?
CORONER => It would seem so.
NAKAGAWA => How is that possible?
CORONER => I don't believe it is.
DOUG => I got us a guidebook to Kyoto. I thought maybe we'd leave tomorrow --
KAREN => Why didn't you tell me?
DOUG => Tell you what?
KAREN => About the bodies they found in the attic.
DOUG => You were recovering from a shock. I didn't want to --
DOUG => Karen -- wait --
100a                                                                100a => Karen paces down the hall towards a RECEPTION AREA.       Doug catches up with her, turning her towards him.
DOUG => Look, I'm sorry. I was just worried about you, and -- I know you, Karen.
KAREN => The same thing happened three years ago, Doug. To a Japanese family, who lived in that house. They were all found dead.
DOUG => So you think the events are connected?
KAREN => How would you explain it?
DOUG => Okay. How about this: the American family knew about what had happened there before, and this knowledge subconsciously caused them to repeat the same events.
DOUG => It's exactly how superstitions survive: if you walk under a ladder and think uh-oh, you're in for some bad luck, sure enough, what do you know? You trip over --
KAREN =>  -- trip over the curb and sprain your ankle.
DOUG => Makes sense, right?
KAREN => Okay. Then explain this: when I went to that house, I didn't know anything about its past. But yet I still saw...
DOUG => Saw what?    Karen?
KAREN => Emma and I were alone in that room, but -- there was something else there. I'm sure of it.
DOUG => You watched a woman die, Kat. That's a horrible thing to experience. I can't imagine how you must feel. But sometimes the mind tries to cope with terrible things in a way that distorts what actually occurred.
KAREN => You might be right, Doug. But I know what I saw.  I think I know what I saw...
DOUG => You just need to rest. We'll get you home, get a good night's sleep.
KAREN => Yeah.
KAREN => You've got class, and I'm sure I only have to fill out a few forms or something --
DOUG => You sure?
KAREN => I'm fine, Doug. Really.
104                                                              104 => Nakagawa is looking at the same picture, in his file.
OFFICER #1 => This just came in. It's the surveillance video you requested.
105                                                                105 => Nakagawa stands at the front door.    Gathering his courage.
106a                                                               106a => Nakagawa's eyes widen as the door swings open.     He sees --
107                                                                 107 => OMITTED
DOUG => I come bearing gifts.
KAREN => That's the boy who was there yesterday. In that house. But this boy, he's --
KAREN => -- he's supposed to be dead.
KAREN => I saw him, Doug. I talked to him. He told me his name. A boy who was killed by his father three years ago told me his name.
KAREN => You don't believe me.
DOUG => How can I believe you, Karen?
KAREN => Hello?
KAREN =>  What?
KAREN => Alex and Yoko are dead.
KAREN =>  There's something wrong with that house, Doug. Something really bad.  The boy in that house, he had a photo of this man. He died on that same day three years ago. I need to talk to his wife... widow. If I can find out what happened, or if... maybe --
DOUG => Maybe, what?
DOUG => I'm concerned about you going out while you're so upset --
KAREN => You don't understand.   I have to, Doug.
DOUG => Why?
KAREN => Because I've been inside that house, Doug. Don't you get it? I've been inside!
KAREN => I love you. But I have to go.
MARIA => Yes?
KAREN => I'm looking for Maria Kirk?
MARIA => Who is this?
KAREN => My name is Karen Davies. I'm a student at -- I'm sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
KAREN => Ms. Kirk?
MARIA => Questions about what?
KAREN => I'm here because... I need to speak with you about your husband.
MARIA => Leave me alone.
KAREN => Maria --
MARIA => Please.
MARIA => I'm late for work.
KAREN => I just need a couple minutes.
MARIA =>  Make yourself at home.
MARIA => Well?
KAREN => Your husband, Peter.    Three years ago he...
MARIA => He what?
KAREN => He killed himself.
KAREN =>  I'm... sorry.
MARIA => Thank you.
MARIA => How did you know Peter?
KAREN => I didn't.
MARIA => Then what are you doing here?
KAREN => I think there's a connection between your husband's death and something that happened to me.
MARIA => What happened to you?
KAREN => It's... hard to explain.
KAREN => Look, I know this sounds strange, but... I don't think your husband wanted to die.
MARIA =>  Then why would he throw himself out a window?
MARIA => Let me guess: `hard to explain'?
MARIA => I put all this behind me. I don't want to open it back up again.
KAREN => If that's true, then why are you still here in Japan?
MARIA => Because I can't leave. I tried. But I couldn't. Not without...
MARIA => He usually didn't wake up before me. But that morning, he did. He made coffee for us. Then he sat there and waited for me to wake up. And when I did, he looked me right in the eye. And then he jumped. The night before we'd been talking about having children together...
KAREN => Did you know a woman named Kayako?
MARIA => No.
KAREN => Did Peter?
MARIA => I don't think so.
KAREN => Maybe it was someone he worked with?
MARIA => Look. I've had the police up here, I talked with Detectives, I even hired a P.I.--  
MARIA => I don't know what you're going through, or what you think you know about my husband. But I don't have any answers. I'm sorry.
KAREN => Please. I don't know what else to do. Please help me.
MARIA => This is all his stuff from school.
MARIA => This was our first date.
KAREN =>  Oh my God.
MARIA => What?   Did you find something?
PETER => Happy Monday.
CO-WORKER => Yeah, right. Here's your mail.
CO-WORKER => Another one, huh?
PETER => I don't even know her. She says I used to tutor her, but I don't know who the hell she is.
120                                                                120 => Peter stands in front of The House.
PETER => Hello?   Excuse me?
PETER => Hello.
PETER => My name is Peter. I'm here to see your mother. Is she home?
PETER => Hey!   Are you okay??? Hello???
121                                                              121 => Peter steps inside, unsure about entering uninvited.
PETER =>  Hello? Excuse me. I'm coming in.
122                                                              122 => OMITTED
PETER => Are you alright?
PETER => Are you alone? Where are your parents?
PETER => What happened to you?
KAREN => Excuse me, I need to speak with Detective Nakagawa.
KAREN => It's an emergency.
OFFICER #2 => One moment.
AOKI => You are asking for Detective Nakagawa?
KAREN => Yes, I have important information for him about a case...
AOKI => Detective Nakagawa is not here right now. Can you tell me what case this is regarding?
KAREN => His partner, Detective Igarashi? Can I speak with him?
AOKI => Can you tell me your name, please?
KAREN => They're dead, aren't they?
AOKI => Miss, wait please --
126                                                               126 => A reading light on the computer desk provides the only illumination in the dark apartment.
KAREN => Doug?
DOUG => "Hey, Karen. It's me. I just wanted to say -- I'm sorry. I know I wasn't hearing you. 
DOUG => If all this is real to you, then it's important to me, and I'm gonna check that house out. So just sit tight, I won't be long. I love you."
KAREN => No.
126b                                                                 126b => Doug stands at the gate, lighting a cigarette, looking down at the POLICE TAPE sealing the entrance. He pockets his Zippo and ducks under the tape, walking up to --
DOUG => Hello?
127                                                               127 => Karen runs towards us, breathless, stopping as she reaches --
KAREN => Doug!   Where are you???
KAREN => Doug???
VOICE => Hey, Maria, it's me. Yeah, I'm still at school...
PETER => ...I know, I'm sorry -- these staff meetings always run over -- maybe another ten minutes or so -- okay, I'll be home soon -- I love you too.
PETER =>  Guess your mom's late, huh?
PETER => Toshio!   We have to --
KAREN => Oh my God...
KAREN => No more... please, no more...
KAREN => DOUG!   NO!!!
132a                                                               132a => The flashing lights of POLICE CARS wash over the formerly quiet neighborhood, illuminating --
132c                                                           132c => ...the light CHANGES. Darkness becomes morning sunlight spilling across Karen's face. The tranquil sound of birds CHIRPING surrounds us. But it sounds like a distant echo.
132d                                                           132d => It's the most beautiful we've ever seen it.   A lush springtime bloom fills the trees and bushes around the place.
