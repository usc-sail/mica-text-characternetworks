911 OPERATOR =>  911 operator, what is your emergency?
OPERATOR =>  Hello? Can you hear me? Can you speak?
CLYDE => ...eyes...
OPERATOR => What? Can you speak up?
CLYDE => ...her...eyes...
OPERATOR => Sir, what is the nature of your emergency?
OPERATOR => Sir? Are you injured? Do you need medical attention?
CLYDE => ...her eyes...she can't...
CLYDE => She can't...close her eyes.
COP #1 =>  Dispatch, we have multiple 10-55s, need full response, 11-41.
CLYDE =>  Her eyes. That's how they were. Open like that. You see?
CLYDE => When I found my wife and child dead, my little girl's eyes were open.  The last thing she saw of this earth were the faces of the men who took her life. Can you understand that?
NICK => Yes. Yes, I can.
CLYDE => Can you? Really?  You?
CANTRELL => Mr. Clyde. I don't see this helping.
CLYDE => No? You married? Children?
CANTRELL => Divorced. I have a son and daughter. Both in college.
CLYDE => My daughter was ten. I married late in life.
CLYDE => You, Mr. Price? Married? Kids?
NICK => I've seen the crime scene photos, Mr. Clyde. Many times. They're horrifying. But they don't alter the facts of the case.
CLYDE => Facts? Those men are guilty. Both of them. You know they are.
NICK => This isn't about what we know. It's about what we can prove in court.
CANTRELL => Things have gone against us. Tainted crime scene, evidence thrown out...
CLYDE => Maybe you just haven't tried hard                     * enough.
NICK => Look. We've had only one real break in this case. The fact that one asshole has decided to testify against the other asshole.
CLYDE => In return for immunity. So he gets away with it.
CANTRELL => The other man doesn't. He'll go down for the crime. That has to count for something.
CLYDE => Yes. It counts for half.  Don't reward one of the men who murdered my family. Please.
NICK => Mr. Clyde. I can't claim to know what it's like to be in your position. Losing your wife and child. But please try to grasp how limited our options are. This is how the justice system works.
CLYDE => Ah. I see my mistake. I came for justice. Instead I got a system.
CLYDE => Sorry. My fault.
SARAH => It's okay.
SARAH => You're due upstairs in three minutes! You're gonna be late!
NICK => Thank you, voice of doom.
NICK => * We doing the right thing?
REYNOLDS                                 * => * You even doubt it? C'mon, you didn't just tumble off the fucking truck. Do the math...
NICK => It's your office.
CANTRELL => It's your decision.
NICK => What do you think?
REYNOLDS                                  * => What are you asking her for? She's                      * just an intern.                                         *
SARAH => * I am just an intern.                                    *
NICK => You were top of your class at Yale, don't give me that shit.
CANTRELL => Young lady. Someday you might have our jobs. You know the issues of                      * the case before the court. Speak.
SARAH => Okay. Um. You can take both men to trial, spend a year and millions of taxpayer dollars, and probably lose. Or you can cut a deal and at least put one of the men who did the crime on death row. It's a no-brainer.                      * You make the deal.                                    *
REYNOLDS                               * => * Duh.                                                  *
CANTRELL => When the day comes that you argue a real case in court, you might refrain from summing up with "duh."
SARAH                                   * => I'll avoid that.                                      *
REYNOLDS => Yes, your Honor. Defense approves.
CANTRELL => State also approves, your Honor.
NICK => Clarence Darby. This document guarantees that you will provide testimony against Rupert Ames in the matter of which you were both accused. In return, you will be 
NICK => shielded from further prosecution for those capital crimes. But you will plead guilty to the lesser charge of breaking and entering.
REYNOLDS => You'll do a maximum of five years. With good behavior, you could be out in three.
JUDGE BURCH => That also depends on your testimony and the level of your cooperation.
DARBY => Your Honor need not worry on my account. I assure the court that I am aware of the opportunity I've been given. And I am deeply grateful to all concerned.
DARBY => If I may. It has come to my attention that Rupert Ames has been spreading                   * lies about me to the tabloid press.                   * About certain alleged activities of                   * which I have no knowledge. Sexual and otherwise. Libel and slander...yes?
NICK =>  You can always sue him.
DARBY => Well, no matter. My tongue will wag in court, under oath. His tongue will wag in hell.
DARBY => He'll get the chair?
NICK => We don't do chair. We do needle.
NICK => Whoa, Jonas, take my elbow.                          *
CANTRELL => I'm not blind. Yet. I'll do it.
NICK => You're shitty on stairs. At least let me take the leash so the dog doesn't pull you down.
CANTRELL => No. She needs to imprint on me. Not you, not somebody else.
CANTRELL => That's the whole point of this phase. She needs to get the idea that she and I are partners. Then the real training can begin. Unless you wanna lead me around the rest of my life.
NICK => I'll pass.
DARBY => ...it was a burglary gone wrong. We thought the house was empty. Rupert found the woman and child at home and went crazy. I was stoned and in fear of my own life, so I fled...
CANTRELL => Bill! You let all your clients give testimony on the courthouse steps?
REYNOLDS => Hellooo, kettle to pot. Since when do you shy away from publicity?
NICK => Since everything in this case has gone sideways so far. Tell your boy to save it for the courtroom.
REYNOLDS => He's your boy too now. You tell him.
NICK => Asshole.
REYNOLDS => Dickwad.
CANTRELL => Fuckface.
DARBY => ...and may I say for the record how very sorry I am that I failed to prevent Rupert Ames from committing those terrible crimes...
NICK => You good here?
CANTRELL => Long as nobody bumps into me.
DARBY => ...been given a chance to put the drugs and foul living behind me. To atone for my past failings and weakness of character. It is a gift given me by God's grace...
DARBY => ...and the grace and wisdom of this court. I cannot thank you enough, sir. I cannot.
NICK => Marshal, escort your man, please!  Mr. Darby is done here!
KELL => Shit day?
NICK => Shit day. Better now.  How's she doing?
KELL => Fine. She drove me a little crazy today.
NICK => She was busy?
KELL => In overdrive. Here. Feel.
KELL => Of course she stops kicking the moment you get home.
NICK => I had to say some things to a man today I didn't want to say. And I did something I didn't want to do.
KELL => You didn't lie to him. Or bullshit him. Or shine him on.
NICK => None of those things.
KELL => So you had your reasons. You did what you had to. It's not your fault the world sucks.
NICK => You in there. Listen up. Your mother just said the world sucks. You may wanna rethink this whole thing. My advice? If you're asking? Just stay in there. I promise you, nothing will ever make as much sense as it does right now...
KELL => What is wrong with you?
NICK => ...plus there's shit you don't need to know about. Rap. Internet porn. Madonna's entire back catalog.
KELL => Did someone drop you on your head? Seriously. I have swollen ankles and all I do is pee. That baby's coming out.
NICK =>  Okay. I'm sure you heard that. Then again there are the Beatles. 70's funk. Louie. Ella. Be a shame to miss those.  All right, kid. Bring it on. But when you're old enough for the world to disappoint you, I hope you won't blame your old man for bringing you into this mess. Give me that at least.
EMMA =>  Dad?
NICK => Huh? Wha--?
EMMA => You know what it is?
NICK => What?
EMMA =>  IT'S MY BIRTHDAAAAAY!
EMMA => IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!
EMMA => I'M SO COOL IT'S MY BIRTHDAAAY!
KELL => Glad it's once a year.
EMMA => Why can't you be here?
NICK => It's a work thing. Grownup stuff. You know that happens sometimes.
EMMA => But it's...  ...MY BIRTHDAAAAAY!
NICK => I believe we've established that. I let go, you'll stop reminding me?  We'll celebrate this weekend. Tonight is all about your friends. Knock                    * yourselves out, don't give mom any                  * grief. I'll try to be home in time to tuck you in, okay?
EMMA => Okay. But what are you doing tonight that is more important than...
EMMA =>  ...my birthdaaaaay.
KELL => Something he'd get out of if he could. Here. Take lunch. Grab                       * backpack. We go.                                    *
NICK => Nice evasion. Thanks.
NICK => How long she have to wear this stupid thing?
CANTRELL => Till the stitches heal. Week or two.
NICK => Poor honey. Sucks, doesn't it? But you're very pretty. Yes, you are. Even with a radar dish on your head.
SARAH => There they are. Like clockwork.
WARDEN IGER => Rupert Ames. Do you have anything to say?
RUPERT => I'm here. Clarence Darby ain't. And that ain't right. 'Cause that man is evil, ain't no other way to say it. All them things he done, and him turn witness against me for it.
RUPERT => I did wrong too. I guess I'll pay up. But it was always him sayin' jump and how high, and I just went along. Now he's killin' me and he got you people to do it. And that's a shame. A goddamn shame. And...  ...and I guess that's all.
RUPERT => Ah...ah...AH!
RUPERT => Ah--ah--Jesus, don't that HURT!
RUPERT => OH FUCK, OH FUCK, THAT HUUUURTS!
SARAH => Oh, Jesus.
CANTRELL => What's going on? Nick?
CANTRELL => Nick, goddamn it, what?
NICK => I don't know!
NICK => WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON? DO SOMETHING!
IGER => We're still trying to sort through this thing.
CANTRELL => Gentlemen, we face a terrible shitstorm of scrutiny in the days to come. We need answers. Start with what we know.
IGER => Lethal injection is a series of drugs given in a specific order. Somebody had to have replaced one or more of those ingredients with something else.  Industrial solvent? Acid?
DUNNIGAN => Let's not guess, let forensics do its job.
CANTRELL                               * => How could the chemicals be switched? We're in a goddamn prison!                           *
NICK                                   * => I'll ask because somebody has to.                    * Is there any chance, no matter how remote, that this was an accident? A mix-up? Weird shit happens?
SARAH => Show them. The bad part.
DUNNIGAN                               * => Some kind of bypass on the phone                     * lines.
DUNNIGAN                               * => Twenty minutes before the execution,                 * the prison stopped receiving incoming calls and emails. Cell service went                  * dark too. Signal was probably jammed.
SARAH                                  * => The bad part. I was just on with the Governor's office. He commuted Rupert Ames' sentence. They were trying to call us to stop the execution. They couldn't get through.
DUNNIGAN => The Governor's incoming number triggered this device and shut out any further calls.
CANTRELL => Oh, fuck me. Fuck me.
DUNNIGAN                                * => One more thing.                                       *
DUNNIGAN => This mean anything to you?                            *
NICK => Clarence Darby. That's what he said when he agreed to testify against the man we executed tonight.
DUNNIGAN => "His tongue will wag in hell." Those very words? It was ten years ago.
SARAH => I remember it too. Some things stick in your head.
NICK => Check the court transcripts, they're public record.
GARZA                                   * => I know this prick. I'm pretty sure                    * he's one of our C.I.s.
DUNNIGAN => You think, or you know?
GARZA => That's not the name he uses now.                    * But I'm pretty sure he's one of Bernstein's informants.
DUNNIGAN => Okay, raise Bernstein, I want everything he's got, including an address. We roll with tactical.
NICK => How about I ride-along? Give you a fast, accurate ID on this guy?
CANTRELL => Is that necessary?
NICK => You said yourself we should move fast. This thing'll be all over the morning news cycle. We'd all look a lot better if we have the right man in custody by then.
GARZA => That's him. "Wayne Dunlap."
DUNNIGAN => Is that Clarence Darby?
NICK => I think so. Hard to tell.
DUNNIGAN => Jesus, look at this. No wonder Bernstein loves him.
GARZA => We scored a lot of good intel off this fuckhead through the years. Almost a shame to bag the guy.
NICK => A shame?
GARZA => He's helped us put a lot of bad people behind bars. Look. Arrests, convictions...
NICK => I can read a C.I. profile. What I see is an asshole dirty up to his ears in the drug trade. So you cops look the other way? He gets a free pass as long as he keeps feeding you convictions?
DUNNIGAN => Isn't that what you did ten years ago? Give this guy a free pass in return for a conviction?  Maybe we played this asshole to our advantage on the street, but you're the one who put him there. So, no offense, but you might wanna go fuck yourself a little.
DARBY => Wait...wait...
DARBY => Almost. Almost.
LISA => This shit makes you soft, baby.
DARBY =>  Thank you...for stating the obvious...you...bitch...
NEWSCASTER                    * => ...rumors the execution did not go well due to technical flaws, but that has yet to be confirmed...
DARBY => "Did not go well." Way to go, Rupert. You even fucked up dying.
LISA => You know that guy?
DARBY => Knew. Past tense.
VOICE => Wayne?
DARBY => Depends. Who's this?
VOICE => Somebody who doesn't want to see you in jail. Look out your window.  Argue later. Do it now.
VOICE => There's a world of shit coming your way. I'd get out the back. Now.
LISA => What?
LISA => Are those fucking cops?
LISA => You ain't leaving me here!
DARBY => OFF'A ME!
COP VOICE =>  You! Freeze right there!
DUNNIGAN => STAY DOWN!
VOICE => Ditch the gun. Wipe the prints.
DARBY => Kiss my ass.
VOICE => I heard six shots. Revolver? Bring extra ammo?
VOICE => You shot at cops. That's attempted murder if they find the gun on you. You're in deep enough without that.
VOICE => You'll need my help getting out.
DARBY => What'll it cost me?
VOICE => We'll discuss terms later. Go south, across 10th. Past the El tracks. Alley behind the clinic.
DARBY => What's there?
VOICE => A cop. Take his ride, he won't give                    * you any trouble.
DARBY => How do you know?
VOICE => 'Cause I tasered his ass. You gonna keep asking questions?
DUNNIGAN => No way he's getting out of this neighborhood.
DARBY => Drive.
DARBY => Drive, fucker! I'll put your brains on the dash!
COP =>  Don't shoot! Don't hurt me, okay?
DARBY => Depends on you. Go.
COP VOICE =>  ...air unit three...see no sign of suspect...think we lost him...
DUNNIGAN =>  Keep sweeping the area, unit three.  Go house-to-house. Check everything.                  * Garages, dumpsters, storm drains...                   *
NICK                                  * => You gotta be kidding me.                            *
NICK                                  * => How could we lose him?                              *
DARBY => In the ditch.
COP => ...please...don't kill me...
DARBY => Knees. Let's go.
COP => I'll never see my wife and little girl again. I'll never see them.
DARBY => It's fucked up.
DARBY => This my guardian angel?  Hello?
COP => I see you got out okay.
COP => You know why I'll never see my wife and daughter again?
BENSON CLYDE => You took them from me.
CLYDE => Can't speak?
CLYDE => Tetrototoxin. Fascinating stuff. It paralyzes you, but leaves all other neurological functions intact.
CLYDE => That means you can't move. Or talk. But you can see. Hear. Feel.  That last one's important. Feel. You can feel everything.  Got some other items here. Drugs to revive you in case you pass out. Stuff like that.
CLYDE => Wearing off a little. No worries.
CLYDE => Oh. These. Don't want you bleeding out. This will take a while.
CLYDE =>  Teeth.  Balls.  Fingers. Maybe toes.  Eyelids. In case you insist on shutting your eyes.
CLYDE => Earlier on the phone? I said I'd get you out? You asked me what it would cost? Well.
CLYDE => We'll start with an arm and a leg. Go from there.
CLYDE => I've been waiting to say that line                    * for years. But it wasn't very funny, was it? No. Played much better in my head. Maybe it's my delivery.
CLYDE => Gosh. My heart's beating. You?                        *
FEMALE VOICE => ...unit twenty one, come in...unit twenty one, please respond...report your location...
EMMA => ...and while we were singing karaoke, Ashley was all dancing around and jumping up and down and suddenly she gets this look on her face...
KELL => I saw it coming.
EMMA => ...and suddenly she just went barf. Total puke moment. And we were all like, ewwww gross! It was so funny...
KELL => Funny for her. I cleaned it up.
NICK => I had my "ewwww gross" moment last night too.
KELL => Hey. I had a house full of shrieking ten year-old girls.
NICK => Hey. I saw a guy's veins dissolve.
KELL => Honey. It's not a competition.  Okay, you win.
EMMA => ...so Tara says that's what you get for eating too much cake and that almost made Ashley puke again...
KELL => Delivery.
EMMA =>  I'll get it!
NICK => Oh, shit. We've gone national.
EMMA => Thank you!
SERGEANT => ...the suspect who tasered you last                    * night...was it the same person who                     * let you out of the trunk this morning?
HILTS => I never saw a face...either time...he wore a thing, a face shield...
VOICE => Sergeant! Sergeant!
YOUNG COP => Come quick! You gotta see this!
EMMA => Daddy?
KELL => Oh my God!
KELL => What the hell is this? Jesus Christ, Nick! Turn it off! Turn it off!  It's okay, baby, I'm here...
SERGEANT => Oh my Lord.
NICK => My daughter is traumatized! She's                      * only ten! It's a goddamn snuff film!                   * In my home!                                            *
GARZA =>  Price got a video of it happening delivered to his house...
DUNNIGAN => Yeah, we know. Nick, we know. The body's been found. The pieces, anyway. Call just came in.  In some old shed on a farm outside                     * the city. About a hundred and fifty acre piece of property.
NICK => Belonging to who?
SWAT TROOPS => DO NOT MOVE--FREEZE MOTHERFUCKER-- DON'T EVEN TWITCH--WE WILL FIRE UPON YOU--LET'S SEE THOSE HANDS--
SWAT CAPTAIN => ON THE FLOOR! FACE DOWN! DO IT NOW!
DUNNIGAN => Benson Clyde. You have the right to remain silent...
DUNNIGAN => ...understand your rights as I have explained them?
CLYDE => Yes.
GARZA => Check this shit out.
DUNNIGAN => CAN SOMEBODY TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF, PLEASE?
SARAH => He says he'll only talk to you.
CLYDE => Counselor.
NICK => Mr. Clyde.
CLYDE => Why so formal? We go way back. Call me Benson. Or Ben.
NICK => Well. I'm here. So?
CLYDE => So. Maybe you can explain what this is all about.
NICK => I think that's obvious.
DUNNIGAN => You murdered two people. Rupert Ames and Clarence Darby.
CLYDE =>  Detective...?
DUNNIGAN => Dunnigan.
CLYDE => Dunnigan. I thought I'd made it clear I would only speak to the gentleman across the table from me.
NICK => You murdered two people. Rupert Ames and Clarence Darby.
CLYDE => Darby? I knew about Ames, of course. I've been following the news about his horribly botched execution. But Darby too? Quite a coincidence.
DUNNIGAN => Cut the shit. We know you did it. Save everybody a lot of time and trouble and just confess.
CLYDE => Are you going to continue to insist on being part of this conversation?
DUNNIGAN => Yes.
CLYDE =>  Fine. Far be it from me to be rude.
NICK => Clarence Darby was found on your property. Old abandoned shed?                *
CLYDE => I didn't know I had one. It's 150 acres, uncultivated. The other day I found a creek I never knew I had. Hunters trespass all the time. You going to try to pin the dead deer on me too?
SARAH => I don't believe this guy.
CANTRELL => That man is frosty.
CLYDE => It occurs to me that an even moderately clever person could try to frame me for the murder simply by killing him on my property. One of Darby's drug rivals? That's an unsavory world.  A jury would have to weigh that possibility. What else you got?
NICK =>  How about video of you dismembering Darby while he was still alive?
CLYDE => That's odd. See, if I were to do such a thing, I'd probably wear something so I couldn't be identified. Some kind of mask maybe. But you say it's actually me on the video? Did the camera capture my good side?                                          *
NICK => You sick fuck, you sent it to my house! My daughter saw that video! It fucking traumatized her! She couldn't stop sobbing!
DUNNIGAN => Whoa-whoa, Nick, ease off!
CLYDE => No trouble here, Detective, we're fine. Thank you, though.
CLYDE => Your daughter is, what, ten now? That's a wonderful age. My daughter was always so busy at that age, so interested, so into everything. Jumping around. I called her "Bean," she jumped around so much.
CLYDE => I am sorry, Nick, that your daughter experienced that. You're right. That video should not have arrived that way. The person who sent it should have thought twice.
DUNNIGAN => Okay, enough.
CLYDE => Unless there's hard evidence tying me to these crimes -- forensic or otherwise -- why am I here? Why are we having this conversation?
NICK => We know you did it.
CLYDE => It's not about what you know. It's about what you can prove in court.  Your words. Like when you called it a justice system. You know the thing about a system, Nick? Any system can be played.
NICK => You think you can play us? You gonna take me on?
CLYDE => Clarence Darby did. And I'm much smarter than he was. Or you.
NICK => I'm gonna bury you, fucker!
CLYDE =>  That's it, that's what I want! That fire in the belly! That's what I wanted ten years ago! Do it, Nick! Bury me!
DUNNIGAN =>  Sit down! Sit the fuck down!
CLYDE => Or. Set me free.
NICK => What?
CLYDE => Did I stutter? Make your case. Or. Shake my hand on the courthouse steps and send me on my way.  I'll even make it easy on you. I will confess, how's that?
NICK => You're gonna confess.
CLYDE => Let's start tomorrow after a good night's sleep. We'll all be fresh and rested.
SARAH                            * => Ten years he's been planning this?             * Patient people make me nervous. This? This freaks me out.                      *
DUNNIGAN                         * => Is he serious about confessing?                * What's his deal, is he crazy?
NICK => Confession or not, we're gonna nail him on two counts of first-degree.
CANTRELL => Agreed, but softly. Nothing hard- ass, no grand-standing. Kid gloves.
NICK => Kid gloves? He's a psycho with a power saw.
CANTRELL => Depending on who's writing the headline, he's a grieving husband and father who got revenge on the men who murdered his wife and child.  Public sympathy is to be respected and feared. This could blow up in our faces if we're not careful. We can't look like we're pissed off or have an ax to grind.  Are we pissed off? Do we have an ax to grind?
NICK => No.
CANTRELL => Then stop acting like it.
NICK => Okay. He got under my skin a little. That's done.
NICK => ...background check's gotta be thorough, I want to know everything there is to know about this son of a bitch. Get all the ADAs on it, tell 'em I better not see them sitting around on their asses or texting their pals...
SARAH => How about outside help? That P.I. who helped us on the Jacovitz case?
NICK => Yeah, he was good. And Hanson's                        * always reliable. But try to limit their hours, okay?
KELL => Well, hello there beauty!
SARAH => Hey Kell! Hey Emma, how's my dynamo?
EMMA => Hi, Sarah!
KELL => We haven't seen you in so long it's ridiculous. When are you gonna come by for a visit?
SARAH => Who needs a life, right? Talk to your husband, maybe he'll give us a day off one of these years.
KELL => Soon, huh? Seriously, we miss you.
NICK => Fuck.
NICK => I saw her bed empty. Scared the shit out of me. Don't know why.
KELL => She had a bad dream. She wanted to sleep with us tonight.
NICK =>  Jesus.
EMMA =>  Daddy...?
EMMA => I had a nightmare. That man.                         *
NICK => I know. Shhh. We're all good. You're safe. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
KELL => Especially not that man. Daddy's gonna put him in jail forever. That's what daddy does. He makes sure the bad people stay locked away.
CLYDE => I admit I expected something more modern. That jail downtown?                        *
NICK => Filled to capacity. It has been for years. They had to re-open this for the overflow. Part of it anyway.                   *
GARZA => Welcome to the county jail annex.                  * All new inmates come here. It was                  * in the papers.
CLYDE => Right. Prison crowding. It's a problem.
NICK => For the record: You've waived legal counsel. You've offered to confess to the murders of Clarence Darby and Rupert Ames. Yes?
CLYDE => We'll get to that. First, what I'd really like to talk about is the cot in my cell. It's lumpy.  Hardly any padding? Steel springs? Very uncomfortable?
NICK => I know what lumpy means. Sorry to hear it. But we're not here to talk about prison conditions, we're here to talk about things you've done.
CLYDE => Start with things I haven't done. Like get any sleep last night.  I said let's begin today fresh and                * rested. You recall my words?                      *
NICK                                * => What do you want from me?
CLYDE => A bed in my cell.
NICK => A bed. In your cell.
CLYDE => Yes, please. One of those Sleep- Matic adjustables. Those are best.                *
NICK => You want the variable temperature control too?
CLYDE => That would be nice.
NICK => Anybody?
DUNNIGAN => It's a steel cot! It's bolted to                  * the wall!                                         *
CLYDE => I'm sure they have a wrench.                    *
IGER => We also have rules prohibiting                  * personal items such as beds.                    *
CLYDE =>  Let me get this straight. You're going to let a bed prevent this confession from taking place.
NICK => You looking to deal? All right, how's this? How about I don't kick your fucking teeth down your throat?
CANTRELL => Nick.
NICK => Sorry, Jonas. Okay, kid gloves.  My daughter slept in our bed last night. She hasn't done that since she was six. You gave her nightmares. So excuse me if I don't feel like cutting any little deals today.
CLYDE => My daughter can't have nightmares, because she died with Clarence                  * Darby's breath in her face. You                 * gave him a reduced sentence and his             * freedom. All I want is a good night's sleep.
NICK => This is bullshit. He's jerking our chain big-time...
CANTRELL => I can justify the expense.                      *
IGER => It's not just a bed. Every inmate               * here will be on the phone to their              * lawyer filing lawsuits for equal treatment. Can you justify that?                *
SARAH                                  * =>  We give him a bed, he confesses, we                  * take the bed away. At most it's one                  * night.                                               *
CANTRELL => We're talking a high-profile double homicide. Order the bed.
CLYDE =>  Switching the drugs was easy...
CLYDE => I hacked the Fedex database, diverted the package to me, made the switch, sent the package on. It's automated tracking numbers moving millions of packages daily. Nobody's questioning who receives what, or why.
NICK => And the prison phones?
CLYDE => Get a phone company uniform, hack the prison database, schedule an official visit. They'll wave you through the gate, like they did me. It's simple if you know how things work.  It's a system. You learn how it works. You play it. Any system.
NICK =>  I saw him die. That stuff burned his veins. He suffered terribly.
CLYDE => Score.
NICK => Let's move on to Clarence Darby.
CLYDE => * Hey, you like music?
NICK => * Very much. Why?                                      *
CLYDE => I could tell. I love music. All of                   * it. It's like air in my lungs. So the thing about Clarence Darby is, I want my record collection and player brought to me. The vinyl discs as well as CDs.
IGER => Vinyl records and CDs can be broken into shards. They make excellent weapons. My answer to that one, Mr. Clyde, is not no, but hell no.                       *
NICK => It's a legitimate concern.
CLYDE =>  How about my ipod and speaker dock?
IGER => The player stays out here. You hand the remote to the on-duty guard every night at lights out. Those terms aren't negotiable.
CLYDE => I appreciate your compromise.
IGER => You looking to get your ass kicked?  By every inmate on this cellblock. You keep this up, they'll take it out on you. Harshly.
IGER => Just trying to keep you alive in here. That's all.
CLYDE =>  I took his fingers with a bolt cutter. His toes with a pair of tin snips. His balls with a hacksaw...
CLYDE => ...his penis with a box cutter. His skin with a filet knife. His teeth with pliers. His eyes...for those I used my fingers.  Check the video I made. All that will match up. I kept him alive for an hour, give or take. Time it.
CLYDE => What now?
NICK => My office types it up, you sign.
CLYDE => How about a signing bonus? The small concessions you've made so far have kept my cooperation flowing...why not give me a reward for signing?
NICK => You don't want to sign, don't sign. We've got you on videotape, we'll go to trial. In ten years, when your appeals are exhausted, I'll attend your execution. I'll make sure nobody tampers with the drugs.
CLYDE => Don't be such a hard-ass, Nick. I don't want much. Just a good meal.  The food here? Sucks. No offense.
DUNNIGAN => What do you have in mind?
CLYDE => There's a place in town on Halston. La Traviata. Ever been?                            *
DUNNIGAN => It's a little above my pay grade.
CLYDE => You know it, don't you, Nick?                      *
NICK => I've eaten there. So?                              *
CLYDE => They cater. Tonight, at 7 p.m., I                  * would like my meal delivered to my cell from La Traviata. With nice silverware, crisp linens...
NICK => Not gonna happen.
CLYDE => Why not?
NICK => Because I have no interest in making it happen. And you have nothing left to bargain with.
CLYDE => C'mon, Nick. We've just started bargaining. You haven't even heard what I'm offering yet.
CLYDE => Miss Lowell? Is your laptop still on? Would you please do a search?
CLYDE => William...Baxter...Reynolds.
DUNNIGAN => Who's William Reynolds?
CANTRELL => Clarence Darby's defense attorney. He brokered the testimony deal with us ten years ago. He's been missing now since...
CLYDE => March of '06.
CLYDE => Detectives Dunnigan and Garza will like this offer, Nick. It'll clear one of their department's missing- persons files. And it'll solve them their third homicide this week.
NICK => Tell me.
CLYDE => How do you think I located Clarence Darby after he got out of jail and legally changed his name? Reynolds told me -- though it took some                       * convincing.                                          *
CLYDE => You want the location of the body? Tonight, 7 p.m., I get my meal                    * delivered to my cell from La Traviata.
DUNNIGAN => SPECIAL AGENT SAM DAVIES, NICK PRICE WITH THE D.A.'S OFFICE!
DAVIES => NICK! TELL ME ABOUT THIS BODY!
NICK => SUSPECT SAYS NEW JERSEY! ACROSS THE STATE LINE! THAT MAKES IT FEDERAL, THAT MAKES IT YOU!
DAVIES =>  GET THE CAMDEN OFFICE TO HAVE A GROUND TEAM MEET US!  LOCATION?
DUNNIGAN => SUSPECT WILL GIVE US A GPS MARK! WE'LL ADVISE YOU IN THE AIR!
NICK => I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE! PLEASE CALL ME! WE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE HOLDING THEIR BREATH ON THIS!
DAVIES => WILL DO!
CLYDE => GPS position is as follows...
NICK => What do we have so far?                                *
SARAH                              * => He's got no next-of-kin. No family                     * since his wife and daughter were                       * killed...
SARAH => He's a tinkerer. Little inventions                     * and gizmos...
SARAH => ...he holds two dozen patents that have made him a lot of money the last ten years. He's invested a lot of it in real estate. Weird stuff.
CANTRELL => Weird how?
SARAH => Properties with no real value. Around                  * airports, chemical plants. Stuff                       * nobody wants...
CONVICT                                  * => Motherfucker...
SARAH => He votes. He gives money to charity, mostly victim's funds...
SARAH => ...but he also gives a big chunk to macular research.
CANTRELL =>  He donates to eye research?
SARAH => RPI. That's the charity you work with, isn't it?
CANTRELL => Huh. Strange.
WAITER => ...consomm...sea bass...squab...                     * New York strip, rare...a variety of                   * pates...
CLYDE => Rack of lamb?
WAITER => ...oh, yes, rack of lamb...
FIELD AGENT => WE THINK WE'VE GOT A CAIRN HERE! SOMEBODY LAID A BED OF STONES AND PLANTED SOD OVER IT!
WAITER => You're bruising the crepes.
GUARD => Life's a bitch, then you die.
IGER => ...no plates, they break into nice jagged pieces...nothing sharp, nothing that can be made sharp...no forks, no knives, no spoons....lose that carafe...we will have no potential weapons of any kind this evening, thank you...you can eat with your fingers...
CLYDE => The guards will think me gauche.
NICK =>  Thanks. Keep digging.
IGER => Idiot.
CLYDE => I suppose if I don't share, you'll beat the shit out of me. Make me squeal like a piggy. That sort of thing.
DWIGHT => Fuckin' A.
CLYDE => I wonder what the little people are eating tonight?
FORENSIC TECH => Okay, let's see if we can get him out in one piece...
FORENSIC TECH => ...gently on three...one...two...
DAVIES =>  --we'll have to wait for the autopsy results, but--
NICK => Agent Davies?
NICK => Why do you have him in the dome?
IGER => He killed his cellmate. We had to separate him out.
CANTRELL => What's wrong with solitary?
IGER => We don't have the authority. Not without a court order. This place was re-opened under protest as it is. Some areas are off-limits to our use -- tied up in a legal challenge by the ACLU as cruel and unusual. Especially solitary.  It was nicknamed the dungeon...
NICK =>  Get Judge Burch on the phone.
IGER => Nice trick with the rack of lamb. Didn't see that one coming.
NICK => Why'd you kill your cellmate?
CLYDE => I claim self-defense.
NICK => Here's what I think. You suckered us in. You ordered that meal for the purpose of killing him.
CANTRELL => Which makes it premeditated. Again.
CLYDE => And, again, you'll have to prove that in court. As I've said before...  ...make your case. Or set me free.
DAVIES =>  Your booby-trap killed two of mine            * and put four in the hospital. That            * brings the total of people you've             * killed to six -- and be advised the           * Bureau does not suffer losing agents in the field.  We're done dancing. I have the right to claim jurisdiction here, do I not, Detective Dunnigan?
DUNNIGAN => That is correct, Agent Davies.
DAVIES =>  So. I'm gonna rendition your ass. Rumor has it we have places that make Guantanamo look like Disneyland. Don't bother packing, you're gonna disappear.
CLYDE =>  You see, Nick? That man is pissed! That's what I'm talking about! No deals, no compromise! You see?
NICK => I see you totally disconnected from reality, that's what I see!
SARAH =>  Judge Burch with an answer for you.
JUDGE BURCH => I'm the ACLU's biggest fundraiser in this state. You wanna put that piece of shit in solitary? Good. As far as I'm concerned, you can bury him in the bowels of hell.
NICK => Thank you, Judge Burch. * Consider your court order signed.  Freedom? Not likely. In fact, you just bought a one room suite in the dungeon. Very exclusive.
IGER => You'll have it all to yourself -- the first man down there in over twenty years. Quite an achievement.
NICK => You're doing everything wrong. Making all the wrong moves.
CLYDE => It would seem that way.
NICK => Sam. I know you got hit hard. I know you're furious. But I'd like my shot at prosecuting this case. * This started with us. Let me finish                  * it. Give me that chance.                             *
CLYDE => I'm seeing fire in your belly, Nick. I like it. Keep going. This is our deal, after all...
CANTRELL => Let's not mistake this! This is not about the two of you!
CLYDE =>  Wake up, blind man! It's been exactly that since I watched him shake Clarence Darby's hand on the steps of the Hall of Justice ten years ago! The Hall of Justice!
DAVIES => You wanna take this fuck down? Be my guest. Whatever you need.
CLYDE =>  That's the spirit, yes!  It's on you now, Nick. It's your game to lose. Just don't screw up. You do, they'll scapegoat you. That's         * how the justice system works.                 *  Good call, Sam. Making me disappear was a bad idea. You couldn't have handled the blowback.
NICK => Blowback?                                     *
CLYDE                           * => Cause and effect. Your actions                * provoke reactions. The choices you            * make come back to haunt you.                  * * There are things I've set in motion.          * Dominoes that will fall. Didn't see           * the rack of lamb coming? Start a list. All I can do at this point...if I feel like it...is stop them from happening. Ready to talk deal?
NICK => You're insane.
CLYDE => See how insane you think this is. You're going to release me from this place with all charges dropped within twenty four hours...
NICK => Or what?
CLYDE => Or I start killing everybody.
CLYDE => Clock's running, Nick.
CANTRELL => What can he do? We've got him boxed in. He's isolated, for God's sake.
NICK => Let's keep him that way. Strict rules apply. Law says he gets one hour outside his cell a day, that's what he gets. Just one, under heavy guard. The other twenty-three hours, he's in that cell, he's a ghost, he doesn't exist. No contact whatsoever.
DUNNIGAN => You think it was a bluff?                              *
NICK => We underestimated him before. I'd like to know what this prick is capable of.  Update on the background check?
SARAH => Properties, investments, a few small                   * businesses he owns -- a lot of it's                    * hidden behind false names and shell                    * companies, but we're still digging...                  *
NICK => That's it? Nothing else unusual?                       *
ROYCE => The last twenty years, he's been                       * Joe Blow Citizen. But prior to that,                   * we've hit a blank spot. He used to                     * do consulting for the government,                      * but we can't pin down what.                            *
NICK => What kind of government work leaves a blank spot, Sam?
DAVIES => I'll make a few discreet calls. See what I can find out.
KELL => Where are you?
NICK =>  Million miles away. Sorry.
KELL => Don't be. This guy's really doing a number on your head, isn't he?
NICK => Yeah. I guess he is.  It's...killing his cellmate. I need that to make sense.
KELL => Why? Happens in prison all the time.
NICK => Yeah, I know, but...we're not talking some gang-banger. This man is precise. Does things for a reason.
KELL => He's psycho. You said so yourself. We saw it on that video. Psychos don't need a reason, Nick. They're just psycho.  Whatever. You'll figure it out. You                  * always do.
NICK =>  Thanks. I'm a poor excuse, though. It's date night. You deserve better.  Just wish you'd picked another                       * restaurant.                                          *
KELL => This is our place. You love it here.                   *  You should have said something...                      *
WAITER => Have we decided?
NICK => Sam? What is it?  Not far, maybe six blocks. I'm having dinner with my wife.
DAVIES => Two words: doggy bag. Be in your office in ten minutes.                                 *  Nick, don't ask questions. I was on the phone all day. Believe me when I say we've got one shot at this.
NICK => He's coming here?
DAVIES => So I'm told. It's called inter-agency cooperation, but don't ask me what agency because I wouldn't know. This isn't even back-channels, this is Theseus in the fucking Labyrinth.  I just blew thirty years' worth of favors today calling in this one chit. I hope it's worth it.                            *
NICK => Yes. Yes, we're all here. Downstairs? Okay. Understood.  He said not to take the elevator.
SPOOK => That's good there.
SPOOK => Which one of you is Davies?
SPOOK => You must be well thought of, Agent Davies. I don't do this. But I was asked nicely by the right people. They briefed me on your problems with Benson Clyde.
NICK => What are we dealing with?
SPOOK => Things I can neither confirm nor deny. Things of which, if I'm asked, I will disavow any knowledge.
CANTRELL =>  You gotta be kidding me with this guy.
SPOOK => He's not. Tell me you grasp the implication of what I've said, or we're done here.
CANTRELL =>  Yeah. Okay. I get it.
NICK => What was Clyde? Some kind of spy?
SPOOK => Spooks like me are a dime a dozen. Clyde was a brain. He ran a think- tank, inventing things for use in the field. Ways to kill people.  You need to get rid of somebody. It's not a situation where you can get close. What do you do?
NICK => Ask Clyde?
SPOOK => That's right. Ask Clyde. And he'd figure something out. Gizmos, strategy. He was good at it.
NICK => How good?
SPOOK =>  You play chess?
NICK => Yeah. Tournament level in college, matter of fact.
SPOOK => In my line, we use an aptitude profile based on chess. A tournament- level player like you can think five to eight steps ahead of an average player, did you know that? Me, I think about ten steps ahead, so I'd take you in a game.
NICK => What about Clyde?
SPOOK => Off the charts. If you're eight steps ahead, he's twenty. Or fifty. He's already got the game won on the first move, you don't even know you're playing yet.  This cellmate he killed? You think that was random? Bullshit. That was a pawn taken off the board. If I were you, I'd be trying to figure out what the move was.
NICK => I have been. Any thoughts?
SPOOK => Top of my head? Was the cellmate ever connected with this case? Or with Clyde? Was anybody else in that facility? Guards? Cons? The janitor? Any connection at all, no matter how remote. Because if Clyde says he has things in play, he does.
DAVIES => Like what? He's locked up. What can he do?
SPOOK =>  You're an average chess player, aren't you?
DAVIES => Actually, I kind of suck.
SPOOK => I can tell. But I like your tie.
DAVIES =>  Thank you. Father's Day.
SPOOK => There's this tie -- we call it the Albert, after Albert DeSalvo. They tiptoe in one night, thread a piano wire with a ratchet gizmo into one of your ties. Sounds crazy, but                     * trust me it works. You put your tie                 * on and all day long it slowly tightens. You don't even notice it's cutting off the blood-flow to your brain. Then you drop dead. Brain-dead or plain dead, doesn't much matter at that point.  Clyde invented that.
EMMA => Daddy!
EMMA => Mom said I could stay up late. Wanna play Scrabble?
NICK => Let me talk to mom first.
NICK => Sorry about date night.
KELL => It's fine. You learn anything?
NICK => Thing or two.
KELL =>  Nick?
NICK => Hey, I was thinking. Maybe you could pack an overnight bag for you and Emma in case you need to...you know...spend the night in a hotel. Or something.
KELL => Why would we wanna do that?
NICK => No reason. It's like a fire-drill thing. You know. In case.
KELL => Honey?
KELL => What the hell are you doing?
EMMA => Daddy?
NICK => It's okay, baby -- I'm fine, I promise. Go back to your game.
KELL => Seriously, Nick. What the fuck.
NICK => Nothing. I got paranoid for no reason, that's all. I'm fine now. I can't believe I let that son of a bitch Clyde get to me like that.
KELL => Are you in danger? Are we?
NICK => I'm sure we're fine.                               *
NICK                                 * => I'll make goddamn sure.                            * * Sarah, roust the ADAs. Tell 'em                    * we're pulling an all-nighter.
NICK => Ready to turn this place upside down?
NICK => See if there's anybody locked up here -- or working here -- ex-cop, witness for the prosecution -- anybody who might have had anything to do with the original Darby-Ames case, or has any previous history with Benson Clyde. Start with the cellmate. Flag anything, no matter how insignificant it seems...
JAMESON => This could take days.
SARAH => We boring you, Jameson? You got someplace to be?
JAMESON => No, Miss Lowell.
SARAH =>  Weekend plans? Cancel 'em! I don't wanna hear any shit about it!  Clack-clack, Jameson. Clack-clack.
NICK => Well?
DUNNIGAN => It used to be a Sleep-Matic adjustable bed. Now it's not.
NICK => What do you have?
TEAM LEADER => Rocky Mountain Way. Joe Walsh.  What do you want from me, it's a fucking ipod.
NICK                                     * => Tear it apart, make sure. Memory.                      * Speakers. Wiring. Everything.                          *
FBI FORENSIC => Blood stain. Few fibers. That's it.
CONVICT =>  Warden, man, whassup?
IGER => Everybody back to sleep.
NICK =>  I want to see him.
CLYDE => You're up early. Trouble sleeping?
NICK => It was a good bluff. But you're done. Fucking with my head. Scaring                    * my family half to death. Done.
CLYDE => Amazing, isn't it? How primal that is. That pull? What a man is capable of when it comes to his family?                        *
NICK                                     * => You strip away all the polite shit,                    * that's what we're really about.
CLYDE                                    * => I hope you never face what it is to                    * lose them, Nick. It's like dying yourself. There's nothing worse.
NICK => Good night, Ben.
CLYDE => Good night, Nick.
CLYDE => Is it casual Friday?  I've never seen you not wear a tie.
SARAH => We dug pretty deep for one night. Still got a ways to go, but on a first look? Nothing. Nada. Zip.
IGER => Well, that's good news.
NICK => So far. Now we double-down. Make                    * absolutely certain.                                 * * Let them all sleep a few hours,                     * then bring 'em back for round two.                  *
SARAH => Due diligence. My middle name.                      *
DAVIES => Fellas. For once, glad not to be of assistance.
DUNNIGAN => Love it when they cry wolf.
DUNNIGAN =>  Miss Lowell! Lost something!
NICK => You're gonna be all right.
NICK => MEDIC! I NEED A MEDIC!
NICK =>  Baby. Listen. Don't be worried or scared. But I want you to pack those overnight bags... I don't have time to explain now. Just do it, okay? I'll call you back as soon as I can -- please, honey, I gotta go.
DAVIES => Each car had an explosive charge on the gas tank.
NICK => He's got someone working with him. On the outside. He's got to.
DAVIES => Not necessarily. Everything looks pre-rigged.
BOMB EXPERT => We found a short-range transmitter beacon buried outside the prison wall. When your people showed up here and drove in through the gate, the signal armed the bombs.                           *
DUNNIGAN => He could have planted those bombs a month ago.
CANTRELL =>  No...no, we've got two dozen ADAs on payroll. Those eight were picked last night on the spur of the moment. How could he know which eight would show up?
DAVIES => He didn't. Our people just found bombs on every car in your ADA pool. All two dozen. We're disarming those now.
CLYDE => I want a phone in my cell. If I'm conducting my own defense, it would be useful. Also in case you and I need to be in touch, Nick.
NICK => Fuck you.
CLYDE =>  Your twenty four hours are about up. In return for the phone, I'll extend you another twelve hours.
NICK => If not?
CLYDE => How many more people die while you stand around dithering? How many do you get killed before my point starts sinking in?
CANTRELL => Motherfucker! Whatever point you had was lost long ago! Eight kids dead in that yard, most of them just out of college! Eight! I have to talk to their families. I have to try to explain why their loved ones are dead.
CLYDE => I've been waiting for my explanation for ten years. So far...  ...NOBODY'S FUCKING BOTHERED!
CLYDE => If it hasn't dawned on you, this is a war. As in any war, there will be collateral damage. The question, as always, is how much damage you're willing to take before you withdraw.
DUNNIGAN => Maybe I got a better idea. Maybe we end this war right now.  Fourteen people dead! I have to say                  * this out loud?  Prisoners die in custody all the time. Attacking a guard. Trying to escape. Shit like that.
DUNNIGAN => Don't tempt me.
GARZA => Jesus Christ, man, dial it back...
CLYDE => Do it. It would be decisive. Stupid, but decisive.  Can you handle the blowback, Detective? The "shit like that?"
NICK => Put the gun away! Are you crazy?
DUNNIGAN =>  It's an option. All I'm saying. Risk the blowback. Ride it out.
NICK => We're not risking anything. Or letting him tear us down.  You're not getting us to throw out the rules, like you. No way.
CLYDE => I like rules. I've wanted you to follow them from the start. Like the one that says you prosecute a man who murders my family.  So. Rules. A phone buys you another twelve hours. But if you haven't cut my deal and let me go by the deadline...
NICK => What? What then?
CLYDE => I'll kill someone in this room.
NICK => Who?
CLYDE => Eenie...meenie...miney...moe...
CLYDE => ...my mother...told me...to pick...a person...and that...person...is...
CANTRELL => Who's he pointing at?
CANTRELL => Fuck him. Let him try.
NICK => That's not helpful! We have fourteen                  * dead! You could ask them what he's capable of, but they're in no position to answer.
CANTRELL =>  Point taken.
DAVIES => We'll give him his phone. We'll tap in and monitor every call.
DUNNIGAN => Buys us another twelve hours, we could use that right now. That puts the deadline at...  ...about 7:30 tonight.
CANTRELL => Shit. I'll be in front of a room full of lawyers. The A.B.A. dinner. I'm the keynote speaker.
NICK => No way. Find a replacement.
DUNNIGAN => Until his deadline passes, you're in protective custody. Not negotiable.
NICK => And have them switch the location of that dinner.
CANTRELL => That's last minute.
NICK => Exactly. He could have gotten your schedule in advance -- been planning to take you out at the dinner along with everybody else. That eenie- meenie act could have been horseshit.  We have to get a few moves ahead. Plan for every contingency.
DUNNIGAN => This way, Mr. Cantrell. Garza, you're with Mr. Price.
NICK => Hey baby -- no, I'm fine. Really. Honey, calm down...
NICK => Our shit just hit the fan in a big way -- we're all over the news...  Yes, all eight died. Sarah's in surgery right now...  ...they think so, but...  ...okay, I'll meet you there. Love you.
NICK => Of course it has. Thanks.
GARZA => Go around. I'll get us in back.
GARZA => Keep the press off this floor, understand?
NICK => Any word?
KELL => She's in surgery now. They're saying she'll be okay.
NICK => Thank God. That's good.
KELL => Good? You'll have to explain the good part, Nick. I'm missing it. This is crazy. What if something happened to you? What would I say to Emma? What would we do?
NICK => You didn't lose me. You won't. Does the school know we're pulling Emma out of class?
KELL => I called, yeah, but -- I'd rather be here for Sarah when she wakes up. Nick -- and for you. I want to do something...
NICK => You are. Getting our daughter out of harm's way. And yourself.  Detective. Will you escort my wife, please?  There's not much time. I'll be there to see you off. Okay? Please?
REPORTER => ...reporting live from a tense scene at City Hall...we have confirmation of earlier reports that eight people with the district attorney's office were killed this morning in an explosion at the County Correctional Annex in George Hill...
REPORTER => ...details are sketchy at this point, and names are being withheld...
NICK => Sarah's fine. That's the good news.
ROYCE => Oh, God, that's a relief...  Miss Lowell is okay...she's okay...
ROYCE => We've been getting calls from upstairs. The mayor's people.  Someone from our office has to make a statement to the press. With Mr. Cantrell absent, the mayor wants you to do it.
NICK =>  Royce...how much petty cash do we have in the safe?
ROYCE => I don't know...four thousand?
NICK => Give it to me. And your cell phone. I need to borrow it for a few days.
ROYCE =>  What do you want me to tell the mayor?
ROYCE => We in the D.A.'s office are still reeling from the events of this morning, as you can imagine. It's a tragic day for us...for our city...
EMMA => I wanna see Sarah...
NICK => Hey, hey...she's fine, don't be scared. That's not allowed. And there's no reason for it.
EMMA => This sucks.
NICK => I know.
EMMA => Why do we have to go?
NICK => 'Cause your mom wants to see a few Broadway shows. You gonna begrudge her that?
EMMA => You're kinda full of shit, Dad.
NICK => Okay, you're right. Maybe I am a little. But only a little. The part you can believe is that this is all going to be fine. Sarah, us.  I mean it. Okay?
EMMA => Okay.
NICK => No credit cards. Too easy to track. Meals, hotel, whatever -- pay cash.
NICK => I'll keep this. It can be traced. Use this one instead. Don't answer unless you see it's me.                           *
P.A. VOICE => FINAL BOARDING CALL FOR NEW YORK CITY DIRECT, FINAL CALL...
KELL => Anything else?
NICK => I love you.
KELL => Emma's right. This sucks.
KELL => Be goddamn careful.
NICK => Jesus.                                                 *
CANTRELL => Nick? These guys won't even let me pack a bag. Not even a toothbrush.
DAVIES => We have granules of an unidentified substance in the ice-maker...
DAVIES => I'm betting something lethal.
TECH #1 => Like this salt.  Not sodium chloride. Potassium chloride. It's a neuro-blocker, stops the heart -- they use it in lethal injections. You'd be dead before you got up from the table.                      *
NICK => I'm telling you, Clyde has someone          * working with him. Someone on the outside.
CANTRELL => Who? Who could he have?
NICK => Somebody from his past. Could be            * that spook we met on the stairs,            * for all we know -- he'd know how to         * plant this shit...
CANTRELL => Him? No--why would Clyde let him come talk to us?
NICK => To fuck with our heads? To get us to bring in our ADAs so he could blow them up?
DUNNIGAN                      * => It would be a Clyde move. But it's          * not proof. * Could he have planted this stuff in         * your house before he was arrested?
CANTRELL => I--I don't know...
NICK => Jonas, think -- last few days, have         * you used any ice? Any salt?
CANTRELL =>  I don't use salt--my cholesterol. Ice? Yeah--not long ago.
NICK => Before or after he was arrested?
CANTRELL => I don't remember! You track your            * use of ice, Nick? You keep a daily          * log?
TECH #2 => Heads-up! Looks like polonium here. In his tea pot. Same way the Russians killed Litvenenko. Took him two weeks to die.  It's an exotic isotope. All you need is a trace amount. Rips through your organs and bone marrow.
NICK                                     * => I'll buy you a new toothbrush.                         *
NICK => Holy shit.
CANTRELL => Nice?
DAVIES => I'm actually a little jealous Clyde didn't pick me.
DUNNIGAN => It's the presidential suite. Last person who stayed here was actually a president. Of a country. Security here is amazing.
NICK                                     * => It's not bad, Jonas. I think you can muddle through.
DAVIES => You're muddling with him. I don't want you back at your house until my people sweep it. You need pajamas, buy some in the shop downstairs.
NICK => The background check my office was compiling -- these properties we                    * think Clyde owns? If he is working                  * with somebody, they could be                        * operating out of any of these. We                   * should check them.                                  *
DUNNIGAN => I'll try to wrangle additional                      * manpower. Big job.                                  *
DAVIES => * No shit. This is quite a list. Over                 * forty locations?
NICK => It's not even complete. Sarah was                   * in the middle of it -- untangling property ownership from under assumed names, shell companies. She's the expert on all that.
CANTRELL                              * => Fellas... I'm grateful for all your efforts. I just wanted to say it.
NICK => Save it for tonight. Hope you're in the mood for Chinese takeout.
CANTRELL => Where are you going?
NICK => That stuff in your house -- it's all gone too far. I started this. I owe everybody at least one last try at defusing it.
CLYDE => Interesting location you've chosen.
NICK => I thought we'd have some privacy.
CLYDE => For what? A talk? Or...  Maybe you've decided to take Detective Dunnigan's advice.
NICK => Be the perfect place for it. Outside the wall. Look like you were shot trying to escape.
CLYDE => You have some kind of signal worked out? You scratch your nose and blam, I'm a goner?
NICK => Something like that.
CLYDE => Might solve all your problems. What's stopping you? Afraid of the blowback?
NICK => No. It's to prove a     point.  Just because I have     the power, doesn't mean I have     to use it.
CLYDE => Ah. Nice. Good one.
NICK => One can show mercy.
CLYDE => Mercy. Right.
NICK => Yeah. So why don't you?
CLYDE => I think we've come a little too far for that, haven't we, Nick? I mean, what do I say? Sorry, my bad? Which way to the execution chamber?
NICK => Don't give me that. Death doesn't scare you.
CLYDE =>  Yeah, but...we're in the flow of this now. You cry havoc, you let slip the dogs of war, you go with                  * it. You don't just stop because                    * someone says hey wait. By then the dogs are dragging you.
NICK => Until one side admits defeat. What if I did that? What if I said...  ...you were right. I was wrong. What if I say I should have prosecuted both men ten years ago?
CLYDE => I'd say you're making progress. You should have, you know. Prosecuted both.
NICK => I'd have lost.
CLYDE => With your head held high. And without any blame from me.
NICK => Yeah...  She is? Great news. I'll stop on my way back. And Royce? Put some get- well flowers in her room, they sell 'em in the lobby. Thanks.  Six hours in surgery.
CLYDE => But she's okay -- good. Miss Lowell is a fine young woman.  Oh, hey...your wife and little girl get out of town all right?
NICK =>  You asking that question makes me want to scratch my nose.
CLYDE => Just a guess. It's what I would do. Get 'em out, make sure they're safe.  C'mon. Like I'd ever have hurt them anyway.
NICK => No?
CLYDE => There are limits. Even in war. I may be many things, Nick. But I'm not Clarence Darby. I'm not Rupert Ames. I'm not that kind of monster.
NICK => What kind are you?
CLYDE => Not the kind who'd hurt your wife and child. Christ, look at me. Mine were my salvation -- then they were killed -- and all I had left was this. Life without them in this fucking charnel-house world.
CLYDE => It hurt to lose them, didn't it? Your family. Even knowing they'd come back.
NICK => Yeah.
CLYDE => Imagine knowing they wouldn't.
NICK => I can't. I can't imagine that.               *
CLYDE => Good. I envy you. For me, knowing                     * mine won't come back is the only thing that's crowded my thoughts for ten years. If I could take a rusty knife and cut out that part of my brain, I would.
NICK => I won't make any more deals with murderers. If hearing that makes a difference...if that was the point of all this...you've won.
CLYDE => Counselor. I have no doubt, as we stand here, that you really believe that. I wish I could.  Are we done? You gonna scratch your nose, or can I go?
SECRETARY => Judge's chambers.
SECRETARY => I'm sorry, Judge Burch is gone for the evening.
SARAH => ...tell Hansen we need hard info on those addresses...don't let the shell game on ownership title slow him down...at this point we'll take educated guesses...
NICK => Hey.
SARAH => Hey. Nice flowers. Thanks.
NICK => How you doing?
SARAH => This place has great drugs. Damn. I should've totaled my leg long ago.
SARAH => They're all dead?
NICK => I'm afraid so.
NICK => You're alive. That counts for a                      * lot.                                                 * * I'm sorry I put you in harm's way.                   *
SARAH => It wasn't you. It was that son of a bitch. I hear he's threatened Jonas?          *
NICK => We're all over it. Jonas is safe --                 * out of reach.                                       *
CANTRELL => Who's winning?
FLEMING => Laszlo, the cheatin' prick...
LASZLO => Yer mama...
GARZA => Wanna sit in?
CANTRELL => If I had my Braille set, I'd clean you out. Not much of a game if you have to tell me what my cards are.
GARZA => Right...sorry.
CANTRELL => People forget. No worries.  Enjoy your game, fellas.
FLEMING => Need help? Want one of us should walk you down?
CANTRELL => I'm good. Unfamiliar places take me a little longer. But I get there.
GARZA =>  Holler if you need anything.  Okay, who's in, who's out...
M.C. => Good evening. Sorry for any confusion our last-minute change of location might have caused...
M.C. => ...please join me in a warm welcome for our keynote speaker this evening, Judge Laura Burch...
NICK => ...yes, you pain in the ass, of course I got your kung-pao...you think I'd forget...just don't give Betsy any, I can't deal with dog farts all night...
CANTRELL => How long, man, I'm starving...
NICK => I'm minutes away. Relax.
CANTRELL => It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
JUDGE BURCH => ...Jonas was upset not to be here with you tonight...a personal matter came up...but he wanted me to give you all his fondest regards...
CANTRELL => There. That's better.
FLEMING =>  ...we need help up here...                           *
GARZA => Jesus Christ. What the fuck hit us?
MAYOR => We're worldwide news this morning. Almost twenty dead, among them some of this country's top attorneys. I had friends in that room. Hell, I almost attended myself.
NICK => The second explosion. I saw a rocket               * fired.                                             *  Clyde does have somebody on the outside.
MAYOR                                * => What you saw or think you saw is                   * beside the point. What matters is                  * that the FBI wanted to rendition                   * this man out of my city. The reason                * he's still here causing havoc is you. You wanted to prosecute this case. Your ambition kept him here                  * and provoked this tragedy.
DUNNIGAN =>  ...not entirely fair...
MAYOR => Detective. Your job is hanging by a thread. I'd think a man of your experience would know when to keep his mouth shut and his ass covered.
MAYOR => When I go in front of the cameras today -- unlike some people who seem unwilling to do so when asked -- I'm going to make goddamn sure the media doesn't hang this abject disaster around my neck. Why? Because I'm hanging it on yours.  You're done. Gone. Fired. Non- existent. Get the fuck out.
CLYDE => Hey. Some legal team from the mayor                 * showed up here this morning. I hear                 * you're off the case. Told you they'd                * scapegoat you, didn't I?  Nick? You there?                                    *
NICK                                  * => How'd you kill Jonas? I know about the second explosion, I saw the contrail, so I know you got somebody working for you. But the first explosion -- how?
CLYDE => Say you find a guy with a bad cocaine problem. Hungry ex-wives. Greedy mistress. Heavy gambling debts.                     *
CLYDE => Say that guy's a veterinarian. You                  * hand him a million in cash, he'll                   * do what you ask. Especially if he's                 * looking to blow town for good...
NICK =>  It was...inside the dog?
CLYDE => You own the vet, you own the dog. Explosive wasn't even that big. Stuff I use, it didn't have to be.  Hidden in plain sight. That's my specialty. Haven't you figured that out yet?
CLYDE => What's next for you? Mulling career options? I suppose law is out.
NICK => I'm trying to get over my friend being dead. Aside from that, fuck you.
CLYDE => Fair enough.  I'll miss you Nick. It was a good dance.
NICK => Didn't bring your family back, though, did it?  Has it made you feel better? All this? You done making your point?
CLYDE => Just warming up. This is Clausewitz shit, my friend. Total war.
CLYDE => I'm gonna pull the whole thing down. I will topple the gleaming pillars and drag the whole fucking diseased, corrupt temple down on my head.  Stay tuned. It'll be Biblical.
REPORTER => ...going live now to City Hall where Mayor Tilden is about to make a statement...announcing, we're told, among other things, the dismissal of District Attorney Nick Price...
MAYOR => Thank you all for gathering on this solemn and anxious occasion...
SARAH => We got the latest batch of background in. Hansen and the other guy did some good work here--
NICK => Sarah. Give it a rest. It's over. We're done.  I'm done. The mayor is nailing my coffin shut. The best thing you can do right now is distance yourself from me as much as you can -- see what you can salvage of your career.
SARAH => This lists over fifty shit-value properties in industrial zones that nobody in their right mind would want to own -- stuff around chemical plants, factories. All are owned by Benson Clyde. Look at twenty-two.
NICK => "Joe's Lube-and-Drive Garage." Went out of business in '94.  Now why would Joe's extinct Lube- and-Shit Garage be of the slightest possible fucking interest to you, me, or anyone?
SARAH =>  The garage, not so much. But the address. Look at the location.
DUNNIGAN =>  Dunnigan.
NICK =>  Do we finish this tonight?
DUNNIGAN => Nick? Jesus...  Look. No hard feelings, but there is no "we." You're radioactive. I                      * can't even be seen talking to you...
NICK => I know who he's got on the outside.  I'll ask again. Do we finish this tonight?
DUNNIGAN => All units. Subject vehicle is on the move.
DUNNIGAN => Everybody maintain distance.
VOICE #1 => Maintain two thousand foot ceiling...
VOICE #1 => Subject vehicle turning south off of Hudson...into an alley...
DUNNIGAN =>  Hang back...hang back...
VOICE #2 => I got a white van...large cube type...think he switched vehicles... moving north again on Hudson...
DUNNIGAN => Five and six, stick with that building in case he's trying to cowboy us. All other units, stay with the van...
VOICE #3 => I have visual on van. Logo on side reads "Nomos Custodial Services."
NICK => Where the hell is he going?
NICK => You don't suppose Nomos Custodial                    * has a service contract with City Hall, do you?
SECURITY GUARD => Mr. Nomos! Ain't seen you around.
CLYDE => Ted...had to get that vacation in. Visited my sister in the Keys...
SECURITY GUARD => Nice. Good for you.
CLYDE => Hey, what's all that hoopla at the main entrance?
SECURITY GUARD => Mayor's got a big fuckin' thing. Thousand dollar a plate whatever. They say the Governor might come.
CLYDE =>  I'll stay out of their way.
SECURITY GUARD =>  They're up on six, avoid that floor. They got more security than God...
DUNNIGAN => What floor?
SECURITY GUARD => I told him to avoid six...  There...
SECURITY GUARD => That's the main courtroom on five.                     *
NICK => That's right below the ballroom. The Mayor's event.
TAC LEADER =>  Subject in sight. Do we take him?
NICK => No. Let him go.  We know where to find him. Let's get to that courtroom.
DUNNIGAN => I hope you know what the fuck you're doing.  Negative. We're letting him go. All units hang back. Repeat. We are letting the subject go.
NICK => There.
DAVIES => Don't touch it! Could be motion sensitive!
DAVIES => I need light!
VOICE #4 => I have visual...suspect leaving the                   * building...different service exit...
DAVIES                                 * => Crap.                                                * * Explosives. Nasty ones.                              *
DUNNIGAN => What? C-4?                                           *
DAVIES => C-4 is for girl scouts. This is malglinite. Take out the whole floor above us...maybe this entire corner of the building...
NICK => Can you open it? Disarm it?
DAVIES =>  No, we got tripwires. We open this lid, instant karma's gonna get us.  Don't see a motion sensor. Trigger looks simple...dial a cell phone, incoming call arms the trigger -- trigger's set to count down from forty seconds, then boom.  That call comes in, we have forty seconds to get as far away from this thing as possible.
DUNNIGAN =>  Alert the mayor's security team.                     * Evacuate those people upstairs --                    * clear that ballroom, go!
NICK => No!
DUNNIGAN => No? What the fuck are you talking about, this could go off any second!
NICK => He won't set it off until that room is full! People are still arriving, red carpet shit, that's at least another half hour!
DUNNIGAN => I will not take that risk!
NICK => You have to!
NICK => If I'm him, I've rigged cameras in that ballroom -- live video feed -- first sign of an evacuation, I trigger the bomb.  We have to think ahead of this fuck!
DAVIES => I'm open.
DUNNIGAN => Okay, Nick. What's the move?
NICK => I came to talk. Guess who wasn't in his cell? Imagine my surprise.
CLYDE => Imagine mine.
NICK => Beautiful how you played us. Getting yourself tossed into solitary --                  * pre-rigged with exits from all five               * cells. Whichever one we put you in, you had your bases covered.  I thought I was such a bad-ass putting you down here. Turns out I was doing what you wanted.
CLYDE => That's how you play. Make the other guy think it's his idea.  You came to talk, so talk.
NICK => Been thinking. If I'd done things differently -- made different decisions from the start -- we wouldn't have gotten to this point.
CLYDE => But it happened. And here we are.
NICK => Here we are.  Your decisions put us here too. This mess is on both of us.                       *
CLYDE => You want to hold hands? What's your point?
NICK => We can't change decisions we've made. We can only account for decisions we make from here. I know what mine will be.  What about you? You gonna finish dialing that number, or what?
CLYDE => If I don't? What are you offering?
NICK => You looking to deal?
CLYDE => I'm willing to listen.
NICK => Okay, here's the deal. The deal is...there is no deal.  I told you. No more deals with murderers. I'm sticking to that. That's my decision. It's what you                  * taught me. Strange as it sounds,                   * I'm grateful for the lesson.                       *
NICK => Your turn. You make the right decision, I'll see what I can do for you. But the wrong decision is one you'll have to live with the rest of your life.
CLYDE => I'm sorry.
NICK => Me too...
NICK => ...because like I said, it's a decision you'll have to live with the rest of your life. Which at this point I figure is...  ...another 35 seconds.
NICK => Check mate.
CLYDE => Well played.
IGER => Jesus.                                                 * * Thank God that wing was empty.                         *
IGER => How do I explain this to the city?
DUNNIGAN => I think the Mayor will have your back.
