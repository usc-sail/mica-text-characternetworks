Millerock time! => Now the foreman turns from his watch to a steam whistle bird, and yanks its tail. The BIRD SQUAWKS the end of the workday --
FRED => YABBA DABBA DO -- ! Fred happily discards his hard hat, leaps out of the canvas-roofed cab on the dino's back, slides down the tail and bounces right into the seat of his stone and timber car! He gets up to a running start with the only motor , slows to allow a "time clock" dinosaur to punch his stone timecard, and then he's trotting back up to speed and out of the gate! MUSIC comes UP and OVER -- MUSIC 'Flintstones, Meet the Flintstones, They're a modern Stone age fam-i-ly --'
saber-toothed cat. => Fred pauses, looks around... HONKS his HORN... BARNEY, BETTY and BAM-BAM come out of the neighboring house, hop in! 
MUSIC => 'From the Town of Bedrock They're a page right Out of his-tor-y -- ' 5   DRIVE-IN MOVIE THEATRE - DUSK                              5

TORTOISE =>  You can forget about a tip for Christmas...
LITTLE MAMMOTH =>  Oh, my aching sinuses...
RADIO WOODPECKER =>  I hate this job... There's not even a health plan...
RADIO WOODPECKER =>  Good morning, Bedrock. This is station B-R-O-K with the morning weather and news... 18   IN THE BED                                                    18
RADIO WOODPECKER => It will be fair and mild through the weekend, continuing for the next eight hundred years, followed by cooling breezes and a protracted ice age... Those walking fingers have reached the top edge of the covers... now they pull them down revealing the owner's face... the face of Fred, his eyes at half-mast, his face covered in fashionable "Bedrock Vice" stubble. FRED  Wil-ma. Wil-ma? How about a great big good morning kiss for your Freddy-weddy? And he pulls the covers down to reveal -- DINO, who is immediately "YI-YI-YI-YI-ING," hopping all over the bed and showering Fred with sloppy kisses. FRED Dino!   Dino, cut it out -- !
RADIO WOODPECKER => In the news, Bedrock civic and business leaders met yesterday to discuss the growing kibble crisis. 
FRED => Dino, that's enough -- here, look, Daddy has a nice dino bone for you, just please stop it --
out. => DINO "YI-YI'S" again, propelling Fred into the next room. Five-year-old PEBBLES GIGGLES at the table as Fred and Dino tumble into the room like Frank Buck and a lion. Wilma turns at the noise. One look at her and we under- stand Fred's romantic turn. RADIO WOODPECKER In other news, Bedrock police report that the Xenosaurus has struck again! Yes, the fiercesome intruder was sighted in the Bedrock Hills for the third time this month. Outlying shops and residencies report extensive looting and property destruction...
WILMA => Fred, stop playing with Dino and sit down. Your breakfast's getting cold.
yeah?" => FRED  -- Gosh, look at that adorable little female dino --
FRED => -- That animal's gonna kill me with kindness. Do you know we're out of dino treats? WILMA So is everybody else in Bedrock. That kibble crisis is getting worse every day. She puts two giant slices of bread into a toaster. Two claw-like devices hold the toast, pulling it out of sight. WILMA I'm afraid Dino's going to have to manage on leftovers from Pebbles and me.
FRED =>  And what's wrong with my leftovers?
WILMA => I'll let you know when I see some.
RADIO WOODPECKER =>  ... Scientists from B.C. University report that the footprints of the Xenosaurus match no known animal.
FRED => That's right, sweetheart. The only thing that's gonna eat you up is -- me!
PEBBLES =>  I'm still a little scared... FRED Pebbles, don't worry. These stories are very exaggerated. Like, you know, the boogyman? There's no such thing as a huge, inhuman reptile that attacks without warning -- WHAM! Dino reappears, bounding through the window and knocking Fred onto the floor. Once again Dino is happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously unresponsive owner. Fred struggles to avoid the slurping tongue, pulls himself up to the window sill, looks out. FRED -- Oh, look, everybody, the mailman is here --
LOBSTER => Well, it beats working in a seafood restaurant...
FRED => Arnold! Arnold! Don't aim at the house -- please, not at the house -- WHAM! Fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams into the window frame, SMASHING a FLOWERPOT, taking out a chunk of wall, and continuing diagonally through the kitchen and out another window. Fred follows this action in time to see -- 22   HIS DRIVEWAY - THROUGH THE OTHER WINDOW                       22 The rock paper drops like a foul shot, rips through the canvas roof of Fred's car, and then bangs a huge dent in the hood.
WILMA => Lucky it wasn't the Sunday paper.
FRED =>  Yeah.   What else can go wrong?
BETTY =>  Come on, kids. Time for nursery school.
PEBBLES => 'Bye-bye, Daddy.
FRED => 'Bye, little sweetheart. (as Wilma clears her throat) 'Bye, big sweetheart.
BARNEY => Nice morning, huh, Fred? FRED What's nice about it?
BARNEY => Heh, hey. That Arnold's got a real arm on him, don't he?
FRED => This is the third ragtop this year ... say, shouldn't you be at work?
BARNEY => Ah, well, that appliance store and me, we kinda had a little adjustment --
FRED => You got fired, didn't ya? 
FRED => Yeah, I know, I know, those crazy inventions of yours. Be honest with me, Barn... tell me one thing you invented that really caught on. BARNEY I invented fire.
FRED =>  You invented fire? BARNEY I told you that, Fred. But the coal conglomerate ripped me off. The case is still in court, but meanwhile I got lotsa other ideas -- FRED Yeah, but did any one of them ever put bread on the table? How long are you and Betty gonna live on those penny-ante royalties you get?
FRED => If you ask me, pal, you're just blowing smoke up your own volcano...
BARNEY => Maybe, Fred.   But first...
BARNEY => Let me try some of that smoke on your car.
BARNEY =>  -- See, the first step, we make a mold of the old car hood, smooth out the dent in the clay -- He tosses the original car hood aside with a crash. Then, moving rapidly, he starts heaving a variety of ingredients into the reverse imprint of the car hood.
BARNEY => -- Add some lava granules... some woca leaves... juice from two coo-coo berries...
FRED =>  Two coo-coo berries?   You made of money, Barney?
BARNEY => Anything for a pal, Fred -- a lump of coal... bamboo sawdust... eucalyptus sap... a touch of the La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila. Barney dips a finger in this mess, "tastes" it; satisfied, he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock weight slams down on the whole mess, making Fred jump out of his skin.
FRED => Barney, why don't you try inventing a brain for yourself! Look at what you did to -- 
BETTY =>  ... Oh, it's not that I'm complaining, Wilma. I mean, Barney's sweet, but... well, he's just not cut out to punch a clock. And he's such a dreamer, you think he ever once picked up a hammer and chisel and tried to balance a checkbook? They pull up in front of a pleasant-looking simple little nursery school. MRS. GRANITE, a pleasant-looking 65, sees them from the schoolyard, waves while Wilma and Betty un- load the kids. BETTY No, Barney just keeps looking for that coo-coo berry pie in the sky, and I don't want to pop his balloon by talking about the price of mastodon ribs.
MRS. GRANITE =>  Mrs. Rubble, Mrs. Flintstone, I wanted to thank you personally.
BETTY => You're welcome, Mrs. Granite. But we wipe their mouths every day.
MRS. GRANITE => No, no, I mean for all your wonderful support the past few years. It's parents like you that make me think twice about retiring. 
MRS. GRANITE => On the other hand...
WILMA => We're really going to miss you, too, Mrs. Granite.
MRS. GRANITE => Have you found another school for the children?
BETTY => We're still shopping around. WILMA Fortunately, we're both -- Wilma and Betty straighten... salute.
CUT TO => Fred and Barney drive along. (Behind them, the same houses and palms seem to be going by... duplex, palm... split level, two palms... duplex, palm). Barney grins, gestures towards the front of the car.
BARNEY => Not bad, eh? After it cures for an hour or so, it's solid as a rock.
FRED => Okay, you fixed a dented hood. But you call that a living? Face it, pal, this is the Stone Age, and it's a dino eat dino world. You want my advice?
BARNEY => Did I ever?
BARNEY => You're a big man anywhere, Fred -- FRED I'm serious, pal. Me and Mr. Slate are just like this -- He takes his hand off the wheel to hold up two fingers... ends up swerving instead.
FRED => -- just like that. I know, I know -- you're not a clock-punching guy -- but face it, Barney -- it's time to grow up and put your nose to the grindstone, batten down the hatches and join the ratasaurus race with the rest of us.  It's time to retire those dreams. Barney looks glum, doesn't say anything.    Suddenly Fred pulls over, stops the car. FRED Barney.   Look. 29   WIDE SHOT                                                   29 They're at the crest of a high wide hill.
BARNEY => Hey.   Lava Lane. FRED Remember the old days, Barn? We used to race our go-carts here to impress the girls.
BARNEY =>  Yeah, those were the days... we usta dream about coming back here some day with a real car and goin' for the goldrock...!
BARNEY =>  Oh-oh! Fred, slow down -- !
FELDSPAR => Well, Flintstone, looks like today's the day. FRED Sergeant Feldspar, I... I wasn't speeding... honest...
FELDSPAR => Gravel. Get me the radar reading and I'll show you how we deal with scofflaws.
RADAR BIRD => Whoa!   Wings, do your stuff -- !
FRED => Well, Sergeant, if you don't have a radar reading, I guess we'll --  -- justbeonourway -- !
FELDSPAR => Flintstone!   Flintstone, come back here -- ! CUT TO:
MORRIS => Ah, my two loveliest customers. It's this darn kibble crisis, Mrs. R... people are buying everything I got to feed their dinos... MRS. SLATE Young man, if you're through flirting, I'd like some service. 38   NEW ANGLE                                                      38
overdressed. => MORRIS Of course, Mrs. Slate.   Just take a number. Wilma senses the tension, quickly steps forward to break it with a smile. WILMA Ah, hello, Mrs. Slate.
WILMA =>  We met at the quarry picnic? MRS. SLATE Oh, of course. Mrs. Flintstein.
GINO => There's one left -- and it's the last one! MORRIS Good.  Give it to Mrs. Rubble along with this.
patties. => MORRIS  How about you, Mrs. F? WILMA I just need a few things for Fred. MORRIS 'Fred...'?  David! Herman! Get Rob and BoBo and tell 'em to bring the big dolly!
MORRIS => You got it. Now then... Mrs. Slate? (pointing at the limo outside the shop) You're in a no parking zone there. 
MRS. SLATE => I want a nice fresh, juicy chickensaurus, Morris. And not one you've had laying around on the shelf. I mean fresh. MORRIS Mrs. Slate, we're kind of busy now -- MRS. SLATE I don't care if you're busy. What I care about is my adorable little grand nephew. He's staying with me for the summer and I intend to make his favorite dish... Southern fried chickensaurus! Now I want a fresh chickensaurus and I want it now! MORRIS Boys, you heard her... she said fresh. 39   THE STAFF                                                       39
MRS. SLATE =>  Morris, while you're at it, I'd like it plucked -- 
MRS. SLATE => My car -- !
CUT TO => Clouds of dust rise from behind the fence. We see the heads of the heavy equipment dinos rising and falling. A two-story office building is at one end of the site with a big "Slate Construction Inc." sign on the roof. CAMERA ADJUSTS as Fred's car turns into the lot, Barney seated beside Fred. The new green hood gleams in the morning light. 44   CLOSER - FRED'S CAR                                          44 Fred digs his feet into the ground, slams to a halt. He gets out, surveys the activity. Immediately, the various workers shout AD LIB greetings. Fred acknowledges these, beaming in the respect he gets here.
FRED => Barney, you won't regret this -- hiya, Al -- fixing dents in cars is one thing, a career's another. Here, you're getting in on the ground floor of the first footstep of a new leaf -- hi, Wally, how's the old backhand? And with a guy like me ta show you the ropes, you can skip all the red tape, all the malarky, all the dino doo --
GIRL =>  Hi, Mr. Flintstone.
FRED => Hiya, Shirley. This is my very special neighbor and pal Barney Rubble. He needs an application form, okay? GIRL Anything for you, Mr. Flintstone.
GIRL => Here you go.  Thanks again for the football tickets. My boyfriend and I both liked them.
FRED => My pleasure, Shirl.    Anytime. GIRL Okay. But do you think next time we could go to the same game? FRED  No problem. Fred smiles at her, hands the forms to Barney. Fres steps towards the quarry, admires the activity, hands on hips, master of all he surveys. He waves to more friends. FRED Well, Barn, what did I tell you? When you're in with Flintstone, you're in like Flint. BARNEY Gee, Fred. I knew you were a big shot. I just didn't know how big. Fred beams at that, and then follows Barney's gaze to the read-out on the truck scale. Fred is standing on it and it's pushing 250. With a scowl, Fred grabs Barney's sleeve and they go into the quarry. As they move, the CAMERA PANS and CRANES UP TOWARDS the window of the Slate Construction Office.
curial moods. => LAVA Uncle, if you'll look at this unit cost projection... it intersects here with -- SLATE -- how'd you like my fist to intersect with your nose? I've told you a hundred times, don't call me uncle in the office! Now, I didn't arrange your scholarship to Harvrock University so you could waste my time! So stop beating around the bushasaurus and get to the bottom slime! LAVA You'll be bankrupt in six months. Slate does a Danny Thomas spit take all over the model. Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers and animals. Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving. Barney's filling out the forms on the move. Behind them, we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the quarry's sides.
BARNEY =>  Social Security number... dependents... 'how learned of job' ... newspaper ad, carrier pigeon...  ... Personal reference... Hearing a loud SMASH, Fred looks up and sees --
PYRITE => Way ta go, Pilty baby. Five bucks says you can't hit one on the fly.
PILTDOWN =>  Yer on, Pyrite -- Pyrite tosses a walnut, which bounces on the ledge.    The wrecking BALL SMASHES into the stone wall. 51   BELOW                                                        51
FRED => Not again... Fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to the level of Piltdown's cab. Barney hurries to follow. FRED All right, Piltdown, that's enough! You're endangering your fellow workers!
PILTDOWN => Yeah?   Sez who?
FRED => Says me, Fred Flintstone -- shop steward of Amalgamated Neolithic Workers 101.
PILTDOWN => Yeah? Well, A.N.W. one-oh-one gives us workers a snack break. So...  ... I'm breakin' some snacks.
FRED => Whoa, whoa, big fella -- He calms the beast by giving it a carrot.   As it munches, Fred quickly ties the reins to a post. FRED  You're on report, Piltdown! If it's up to me you'll be pushing a wheelbarrow!
PILTDOWN =>  You've been asking for this, Flintstone... I'm gonna kick your fat butt -- FRED Fat butt? Hold me back, Barney --  -- Barney, hold me back -- Quickly the men form a circle around Piltdown and Fred. Barney looks up and sees -- 55   THE CRANE ON THE DINO'S BACK                                55
BARNEY => Hey, maybe you guys oughta fix that first. PILTDOWN Why should we? 
SLATE => Bankrupt?   Are you crazy?
LAVA => It's all here in hack and slice. When you committed to this housing development the price of dino kibble was a few clams per ton. Since then, it's gone up a hundredfold.  You can't build a project like this without the heavy equipment dinos, and we can't afford to feed those dinos.
SLATE => I'm two months behind schedule, my option's running out on the land and Donald Trumprock is just waiting to jump in and steal the whole deal ... meanwhile that damn union's on my back, hell, they'll probably want an eighty hour week or something...  There's got to be an answer...
attention. => 
LAVA =>  Sounds like a worker's comp claim if I ever heard one...
FRED => Barney!   Grab that line!   Hurry! Barney scrambles up Fred's back, shoving a foot in Fred's face, but finally snatching the rope. He pulls on it... Fred throws his own weight into the effort...
FRED => Oh boy.    Goodbye pension fund -- They rush for the office building.
body. => LAVA Uncle, Uncle, speak to me -- But it's only a statue of a golfer from one of Slate's trophies. SLATE  I'm over here, you moron -- and don't call me 'Uncle'!
PILTDOWN =>  It was Flintstone, Mr. Slate!
PYRITE => That's right, Mr. Slate, it was Flintstone! BARNEY That's a lie, Mr. Slate!
SLATE => Who are you?
SLATE =>  Congratulations!
FRED                                PILTDOWN => Huh?                               What? SLATE This stuff you had on your car is the most incredible building material I've seen in thirty years in the construction business!  It's strong --  -- Light --  -- Resilient -- It rebounds, "SPROINGING" him on the chin.        He recovers, shakes it off.
SLATE => Where on earth did you get it?
FRED => Oh, it's ah, just something I whipped up in the old garage workshop --  -- with a little help from my buddy Barney, right, Barn?
BARNEY => Well, actually, Fred, it was the other way ar-- Fred hisses between his teeth, repeats the "Slate and me are just like this" gesture he made earlier, points at Slate. 
SLATE => The rest of you men go back to work. I want to talk to Flintstone and the personal reference alone. Come on, move, move... They go out, Piltdown looking furious.
SLATE =>  Light  as a Pterodactyl feather... why, a  child could handle this... Lava,  we could cut construction costs  in half... in quarters... in uh...  whatchacallit -- LAVA  Eighths -- SLATE Eighths, right. Flintstone, what do you call this stuff? FRED Well, Mr. Slate, I call it --  -- Barney, what do I call it? BARNEY  Fibrerock, Fred... FRED -- I call it Fibrerock Fred -- !  I mean, ah, 'Fibrerock'!
SLATE =>  'Fibrerock'? 'Fibrerock'?  'Fib-bre-rock' --
SLATE'S STAFF =>  Love it... great... has a nice ring... says it all, you know?  Slate takes the piece of material, leans it on the table so it catches the light. Despite himself, Lava comes over, examines the car hood... can't help but marvel at it as well. Meanwhile, Slate puts his arms around Fred and Barney.
SLATE =>  You see this, Lava? All those courses of yours at Harvrock University, and who saves my bacon? Two simple-minded run-of-the-mill nobodies.
BARNEY => Gee, thanks, Mr. Slate. Lava glowers. Slate pulls Fred and Barney close with genuine excitement. SLATE Boys, this is a small step for Slate Construction... a giant step for all mankind. He points to the translucent material. CAMERA TIGHTENS ON it. We see Fred, Barney and Slate's reflections in it.
SLATE =>  The Stone Age is over!    Let the Fibre Age begin! As HEROIC MUSIC STINGS IN, we...

CHILDREN => 'La hachette de ma tante est sur le roche de mon oncle -- ' HEADMISTRESS  Madame Mrs. Slate, bonjour! Welcome to L'ecole des Enfants Prehistorique Haute Superior! MRS. SLATE Thank you, Marie.  I ordered the hors d'oeuvres for the junior talent show. They were out of Ceolanth caviar so I got Mastodon brie instead. Oh, ah, these are my, uh, friends, Wilma Flintstein --
WILMA => Flintstone --
MRS. SLATE => -- oh, it used to be Flintstein -- ? And this is ah, Becky... Betty!

HEADMISTRESS => An' your friends perhaps would like zum school applications for zere enfants?
MRS. SLATE =>  Them? Oh, Marie, really, you don't understand --
BETTY =>  That's right, you don't understand. My husband's business manager usually handles this sort of thing, but I don't mind. And to Wilma's astonishment, Betty takes one of the parchments. BETTY I know Bam-Bam --  -- pardonez-moi, 'Bem-Bem' will love attending your school and performing in the talent show. Thank you oh so much.
WILMA => Let me have one of those, too.   For ma petite Pebbles.
BARNEY => Gee, Fred, I don't believe it. Eight hours ago I didn't have a job and now look -- I got 1/2 of one percent of the after-taxes after-expenses net breakage profits on Fibrerock! FRED Just be thankful I was there to go over the fine print.  It's like I told you this morning -- There's something noble about a man digging in with his hands and doing an honest day's work. Once you file those dreams under 'old business' and put your nose to the plow, well, the world is your oyster. And was I right? BARNEY No, Fred, you weren't. I didn't nose any grindstones and you didn't shoulder a wheel. We just hung out together and everything that happened was a total accident.
FRED =>  Details, Barney, details...  I just can't wait to see the girls' faces when we tell 'em the news...
WILMA => Betty, sometimes you're a little too gullible --
BETTY => Don't tell me. I still can't believe what I did today... WILMA No kidding.  Do you have any idea of what the enrollment fee is? And get this... it's non-refundable -- BETTY I know, I know! I just couldn't stand that woman's attitude! But we had to find a new school anyway, and there we were... the next thing I knew, I was in over my head... but why did you jump in, too?
WILMA => Oh, she was getting to me too with all that mastodon snort about her little nephew... and... BETTY And?
WILMA => And... if a friend can't help you do something stupid, who can?
BETTY => What do we tell the boys?
WILMA => What's wrong with the truth? 
BETTY => Flowers? WILMA Rock candy?   That's nice, but... why?
FRED => Why? Oh, me and Barn, we suddenly realized that we had a little spare change.
WILMA =>  Not anymore you don't... BARNEY  Betty, these are for you. For sticking beside me during the tough times, and well... for making a little guy feel like he was ten feet tall.
BETTY => Aw, Barney... I... I don't deserve these. I did something really stupid today.
BARNEY => Hey. Fred does something stupid every day and I still love him.
FRED => Noogy, noogy, ha, ha -- !
FRED => Ready when you are.  Hey, '1'... a good year.
WILMA => Fred, there's no easy way to say this so --
yawn. => 76   FAVORING WILMA AND BETTY                                       76 They can't believe this. BETTY Boys... did you see... the dollar signs there at the bottom? WILMA The non-refundable dollar signs?
BARNEY => Plenty more where that came from.
FRED => We see your dollar signs, ladies... and...
FRED => ... we raise them.
WILMA => Betty... these... these look... real -- 
FRED => You bet they're real, sweetheart. They're as real as... as... well, as real as --  -- the best darn friends and neighbors in the whole world.
FRED =>  Right, pal o'mine. As they laugh and the girls slowly absorb the truth, we --
CUT TO => A sign proclaims this as "GRAND BEDROCK LODGE -- LOYAL ORDER OF WATER BUFFALO." The parking lot outside is full of vehicles. We hear the sound of a GAVEL BANGING... HERDMASTER Attention, fellow Water Buffaloes...
HERDMASTER  bangs => again for order. HERDMASTER Brothers, your attention!
ENTIRE GROUP => Ack-ack-a-dack! HERDMASTER  This meeting of the Water Buffaloes is now in session. Sergeant-at-Arms, have we got any old business? Barney stands, acknowledges his friends and Lodge brothers. BARNEY Indeed we do, Brother Herdmaster. Tonight we are to hear speeches from prospective candidates for Lodge offices, such as good old Fred and some other guys. 79   PILTDOWN                                                    79 Seated across the room with Pyrite and other cronies, he immediately leaps to his feet, paws the ground, and gives an eerie moan even stranger than the Herdmaster's earlier call to order.
HERDMASTER => Brother Piltdown: You have given the Cry of the Gelded Buffalo at the Poisoned Water Hole. Do you wish to file an objection?
PILTDOWN => You bet I do. How come Flintstone is 'good old Fred' and me and the other candidates are just 'some other guys'? PYRITE Yeah, how come? 
FRED =>  Brother Buffaloes, honored Herdmaster, Junior Bucks and Apprentice Antlers, a great good evening to you all. Ahem. As you know, our organization has survived difficult times that have seen the extinction of such other lodges as the Order of Whooping Cranes and Brotherhood of Giant Sloths. But we here have come through the croo ... the crux... BARNEY  -- crucible --
FRED => Hey, when you're hot you're hot... boys, lemme buy a round of drinks for everyone.
BARNEY => Thanks, Fred, but here at the lodge drinks are free.
FRED =>  Here you go, boys, nice and frosty... "BOTTLE OPENER" CREATURE  Go ahead, laugh. If I had a good orthodontist, my life woulda been different... Fred tosses the "Opener" aside --
exits. => 89   BACK TO SCENE                                                89
FRED =>  Well, here's to...
FRED => Here's to the greatest bunch of lifelong Buffaloes a guy could dream of leading.  Anybody else got a toast...?
BARNEY => 'Here's to the Water Buffalo and their next Herdmaster... Fred'!
FRED => Aw, gee, Barn... you shouldn't say that...  ... at least not till after next week's election! LODGE MEMBER Fred, what was all that stuff in your speech about the workplace? I thought the only decision you made there was how many lunches to eat -- Laughter. Fred accepts it good-naturedly, reaches into his pocket. FRED Well, Harry, it just so happens that old Fred is moving up in the world... Boys, you're looking at Mr. Slate's new partner.
PILTDOWN => You and Slate? Who are you kidding, Flintstone? The only partner you got is hanging over your belt. Pyrite laughs, a bit too much.
FRED => Prepare to eat those words, Piltdown.
PILTDOWN => -- If I don't, you will -- FRED  Gentlemen, my card -- He passes them out, and the others take them, curious --
LODGE MEMBERS =>  Hey, way ta go, Fred... Whoa, gonna switch from a hard hat to a top hat, Freddy boy...?

FRED Barney, it's all part of the plan.  Yes, boys, you see, I went up to my pal, Mister Slate and single- handedly made him an offer he couldn't refuse -- 
FRED => -- 'Freddy boy,' he sez to me, 'We gotta talk turkey -- '
BARNEY => Fred, we gotta talk turkey -- FRED That's right -- just like that --
BARNEY => Fred -- !
FRED => Ah, excuse us, boys...
BARNEY => Fred... what's this single-handed stuff? I distinctly remember at least four hands and two of them were mine.
FRED =>  Barney, we could tell everyone how you invented this Fibrerock stuff, how Slate and Lava found out about it by accident and all, but what would that be? BARNEY The truth? FRED This is big business, Barney. We can't start telling the truth, it'd create the wrong impression. Think about all the really big deals in history -- back to the beginning of recorded time. Barney knits his brow in thought for maybe three seconds. BARNEY Okay. FRED What do they all have in common? (as Barney is stumped) I'll tell you. A front man. A guy who's out in the public eye running the point, fighting the crowds... and meanwhile... back in the corner is the silent partner.
BARNEY => I never knew that.
FRED => That's because the silent partner is always silent. 
BARNEY => I get it. I got the brains, but you just pretend to have them.
FRED => Attaboy! And a confident Fred shakes hands with an unsure "silent partner"... CUT TO:

Betty comes over and we see he's wear- ing a sports jacket and an abysmally-tied tie. Betty fixes the knot. BETTY There. That looks more like a captain of industry. BARNEY Thanks, Betty. What would I do without you?
BETTY => Hmm. Probably run off to the tropics with one of those executive secretaries.
WILMA => Fred! Wait a minute! There's something wrong with your lunch --
FRED =>  Yeah... it does feel a little light... He returns to her, opens the pail, is surprised to find it's empty. Before he can comment, she smilingly presents him with a spanking new briefcase. "F.F" is embossed on it in gold. WILMA Fit for a king... my king.
FRED => Aw, Wilma... lookit, it's got buckles, a strap, a lock -- He opens it.    Inside is a huge drumstick and some ribs. FRED -- Baby, you're the greatest.

PILTDOWN => Yeah. Must be a fortune in coo-coo berries on that baby. You know, for that Fibrerock stuff of Flintstone and Rubble's. You gotta sign here for it.
LAVA =>  I... I'll get back to you.
LAVA => Piltdown, this Fibrerock program is going to create a lot of changes around the plant. I want to make one more. You've been a wonderful thug and goon for me. Now, I'd like to expand your duties. I want you to become a provocateur. PILTDOWN Gee, Mister Lava, I donno.   I kinda like girls myself.
LAVA =>  What I mean, is, I'm going to use you to double-cross your Lodge and Union brothers, and make their lives a living hell.
PILTDOWN => Oh, okay. LAVA Good. You and your little pal will report directly to me and take orders only from me. (slapping him on the back) Now get out of here and start screwing your former friends and associates.

FRED => Hey.   What's going on? LAVA The Fibrerock  assembly line. Unc -- Mister  Slate's had a crew working on it  all weekend. We're going to roll  out the first sheets of Fibrerock  by mid-week.
FRED => Yes, yes. Quick, dynamic entry into the marketplace. I approve.
BARNEY => But, Fred, it's right where the employee basketball court used ta be --
BARNEY => I guess so.   You already did. Lava leads them to a wood-sided trailer.
LAVA => Well, gentlemen, here you are. As soon as you're settled, come over to the assembly line. We'll go over the Fibrerock formula before the first run. He goes off.

The single window here looks out over the quarry scrap heap. (As we watch, somebody dumps a load of debris.)

A Fibrerock copy     of the stone sofa drops neatly out of the mold, bounces    lightly on the conveyor belt below! It sparkles with     the tell-tale celadon-green shimmer of Fibrerock. As     it chugs along, the process repeats, and soon a score    of identical sofas is in view.

SLATE => No longer will man and beast bend under the backbreaking load of stone and rock and timber... because Fibrerock is so light that even a child can handle it.  That's why on Monday we're going to hire two dozen children from Bedrock Technical Junior High. They'll be replacing the 36 heavy equipment operators, 15 shaft diggers and 22 laborers we're laying off today. Your pink slips will be in your final pay envelopes along with a ticket to the grand opening of Slate City. It's non-transferable, so hang on to it. Thank you, and have a nice weekend.

SLATE => Or...  I could fire you, Fred. FRED  Me! Ah, ha, that's rich, Mr. Slate, that's -- Suddenly Fred stops laughing. SLATE Flintstone, Lava, here, recommended that you be in charge of public relations to get Fibrerock off to a good start. I'm a member of that public, Flintstone, and I have to say... this isn't a good start. I'm getting a bad feeling about Fibrerock. A bad feeling about... you. You want that feeling to go away, don't you? FRED Uh... well, gee, I... uh, yeah. SLATE Good. Then turn around and walk out of here and we'll forget all about this.
WORKERS => Well?   What'd he say...? Ol' Freddie  boy told him a thing or two...  Probably got us a raise... Right,  Fred...? Fred...?

HERDMASTER => All in favor, say -- FRED Wait, wait... Your Antlerness, please, one second -- ! Fred grabs Barney by the shoulder, spins him around, pushes him forward like a refrigerator on a dolly, stands him up center stage. FRED Barney, you gotta tell the other guys what really happened. Tell 'em the story behind Fibrerock. The true story. The room quiets.    Barney clears his throat.     Fred waits, hopeful. BARNEY Well, there's not much to tell. (trying to remember Fred's phraseology) True, I got a cut... but Fred's got a gut.

PILTDOWN => Thank you, Brother Chairman. Fellow Buffaloes, I'm a man of few words. It's no secret that most of our lodge members are also members of Amalgamated Neolithic 101... which means that most of us aren't gonna be able to make our cave payments next month. So my agenda for tonight... ends right now. There's a time to be a Buffalo... there's a time ta be a brown nosin' double-crossin' creep... All heads turn and swivel to look at Fred... swivel back.

BARNEY => Yup. See, ever since I started with Fibrerock -- I mean, since me and Fred started with it, I always take a little taste of the Fibre foam. And tonight's batch, well... I didn't get much of it, but it seems a little off.  Can't fool the old taste buds, heh-heh. I think there might be an ingredient missing. So tomorrow, I'll run a couple of tests and stuff -- LAVA Rubble, Rubble! We're fighting a deadline to finish Slate City... and we're not pulling the plug on production to satisfy your tastebuds! If you ask me, you and your tastebuds are overworked ... overwrought... how long have you been with us, anyway? BARNEY Nine days, Mister Lava.

Frederick, 'ow does it feel to know that you 'ave personally brought the Stone Age as we know it to a long-deserved end? FRED  Well, Rockin', you're right, I have affected destiny for all mankind, and it's a sobering thought. However, if I may add a personal note at this time, I myself cannot personally take all the credit for Fibrerock...
BARNEY =>  See?   What'd I tell ya?
FRED => No, I could never have done it without the inspiration and support of a very special person. I'm speaking, of course, of my close friend and associate, Mister Slate, founder and C.E.O. of Slate Construction... 191   WILMA, BARNEY, BETTY                                         191
POINDEXTER => Wow! Is this ever keen! Dad, you promise I can cut in all the lines? LAVA Of course, Poindexter, of course. They head for the mastodon    and pully-powered elevator. Standing there are Piltdown    and Pyrite, both in security guard uniforms. (Piltdown     is carrying a vaguely-familiar satchel). Lava gives them     a big look. They nod. As the elevator rises, his two    cronies duck into a stairwell marked "NO ADMITTANCE."
FRED => Hello, hello. Bon soir. Good to see ya... glad you could make it...
GUEST =>  Hello, Frank...
FRED => Fred -- there's the bar, make yourself at home -- mi casa es votre casa, so, when in Rome and all that -- WILMA  Fred, can I talk to you -- ? Fred? Fred?  We have a serious problem with Betty and Barney. FRED  You mean you can see their house -- ? WILMA  I mean you're treating them horribly! What's come over you, Fred? Does a little money mean so much to you that you just turn your back on the things that really count? FRED Wilma, I'm shocked. I wouldn't do that. Okay, I admit it: I'm trying to make an impression here, I wanna look good, I wanna be a success...
WILMA => Arrrgh -- !
FRED => What'd I say?
P.A. => That was our location guy at Slate City. They just moved the ribbon cutting up by an hour. Guests are already starting to arrive. LEACH Fabulous! I've 'ad enough crab meat and crabgrass to last me a year. All right, boys, that's a wrap! 197   FRED                                                           197 In the middle of a tight little group which is pigging out. Fred seems oblivious to the fact that they're oblivious to him.
FRED => ... Yas, yas, it's a challenging commodity market these days. Personally, I'm considering petrified forests, but they do say that volcano futures are ready to explode, ha, ha...
FRED => ... Hey, whoa, what's happening --
FRED => Fred! He stumbles through the thinning crowd, clutching at elbows.
FRED => Hey, what's the hurry? We got a cake shaped like a piece of Fibrerock... I got it, how about some charades? No, even better, twenty questions: 'Am I animal, mineral, or fossil'...? Oh, I heard a great one the other day ... a guy walks in a bar with a duckasaurus on his head and the bartender says -- this'll kill you, the bartender says -- Fred stops, running out of steam along with his moment of glory. He stands alone on the lawn. Wilma slowly comes up to him.
WILMA => Fred... I... I'm sorry it's not working out... Fred turns, puts on a big smile. FRED Whaddya mean, not working out? They're goin' party hopping, that's all. That's what ya do in society, Wilma... you cruise around. They'll go over to Slate's shindig for a while, then they'll come back here. WILMA Fred...
FRED => You go on over to Slate City, okay?
WILMA => Fred, I want to be here with you -- 
WILMA => Come on, Pebbles. We're going to another party. PEBBLES Will there be real food there? WILMA We'll find out together. She takes the girl's hand and goes to the door, where the last of Leach's crew is just going out. Suddenly Betty catches up to her, Bam-Bam in tow.
BETTY => Wilma, wait.   I'm going with you. WILMA Why? BETTY If friends can't do something stupid, who can? Wilma smiles, touched.
BETTY => Besides...  ... Maybe if we leave the boys alone...?
FRED => Just you and me now, Dino. Yeah. That's okay. Man and man's best friend.

Then he grabs a lawn chair from the yard, begins to smash it in a fury against the divider. The wall cracks, splinters; the potted plants go flying. 203   FRED                                                        203 His anger spent, he stands panting, splattered with dirt... then he sees -- 204   NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER DIRT-COVERED FIGURE                     204 -- standing in the ruins of the wall. The figure sneezes, whacks dirt off of itself. It's --

BARNEY =>  Hiya, Fred. (noticing his ruined tuxedo) Boy, the rental place is gonna be mad...  ... You feeling better, pal?
FRED => Well, yeah.   But more of a --
BARNEY =>  Fool?
FRED => Well -- BARNEY Slimeball? Louse? Jackass?  Stuck-up blimpasaurus? FRED (wincing, but taking it) Barney... can... can you ever forgive me for being such a jerk?
BARNEY =>  Sure, Fred.  I've had lots of practice. FRED  Aw, Barn... And he grabs Barney in a big bear hug. Tears in both their eyes, they slap each other on the back, two prehistoric sensitive guys. CUT TO:

FASHION PARROT => But does Fibrerock belong only in the kitchen, the garage, the workplace? No, no, no, my darlings!
FASHION PARROT => Because the clothes of the Stone Age are as extinct as stones themselves! Yes, thanks to the wonder of Fibrerockfibre, the world of high fashion will be totally transformed... by Fibre furs... Fibre frocks... Fibre foundations and Fibreshoes... it's to die for!
FIBRE CHOIR => 'It's a Fibre World you know, It's a Fibre World you know, It's a Fibre World you know -- ' CUT TO: Fred and Barney are surrounded by books and cartons and memorabilia. They have their arms around each other and are singing. FRED & BARNEY 'Now it's time to do or die, grab that rock and kick it high, let's fight, fight, fight for Bedrock High!'
FRED => Boy, those were the days, Barney. Bedrock High winning all those games... and you and me right in the middle of it.
BARNEY => Yeah.   Too bad we never made the team. FRED So what? We made the team spirit. That's just as important... whatever happened to those cheerleader costumes?
BARNEY => You know Betty. She never throws anything away. He hauls out an old footlocker, opens it.    There they are. FRED  Boy.    Talk about memories. Fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to Barney, who grins, pulls it on. Fred also starts to get into his old "uniform," but has to suck his gut in mightily. Finally, he can zip it up, stern to stem. FRED Back then, we thought a pop quiz was a big problem. We didn't know how good we had it. No problems, no worries...
forward. => BARNEY Speaking of problems and worries, shouldn't we get on over to Slate's party? Fred has finally "clinked" the monster head down into place. Now, when he talks, the monster's mouth moves in sync.
direction. => FRED  All they've been doing is using us, Barney. And meanwhile --
FRED =>  -- Meanwhile all the time they were laughing at us.
BARNEY => Yeah?   When did you notice that? FRED About an hour ago. BARNEY Boy, there's no fooling you, Fred. Suddenly, with a GROWING CREAKING, CRACKING and TINKLING, a scale model of Slate City in the corner begins to fall apart.
BARNEY => It should be. There's enough coo-coo berry resin in there to petrify a brontosaurus -- Suddenly Barney gets it. He looks from the older models to the now decomposing little Fibresphere with growing awareness.
BARNEY =>  -- The coo-coo berries! Fred, that's it!
FRED => What's it? BARNEY Remember I said the Fibrefoam tasted funny? It was the coo-coo sap that was missing!
FRED => But.. why would -- BARNEY Why? Because coo-coo berries are as valuable as goldrock! And we've had tons of 'em delivered to the plant since we started... somebody musta got greedy --
FRED => -- Not 'somebody' -- Lava!
BARNEY =>  Fred, that sap acts as a fixative -- it's the glue that holds the whole formula together -- ! 
BARNEY => Coo-coo berry sap, Fred! It's our only chance -- their only chance! Barney gives it a quick test squirt. Fred nods, and they rush out of the room. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON the ruins of the model "Slate City"... CUT TO:
LAVA => You're certainly looking lovely this evening, Mrs. Flintstone. Life with a junior executive must agree with you. 
LAVA =>  Yes. I think so, too.  Imagine how good you'd look with a senior executive.
WILMA => Oh?   Is Fred getting promoted? Lava laughs, sure she's kidding... then not so sure. The ventriloquist finishes to scattered applause. The kid bows, gets up... splashes across puddles of water on the stage area. The Headmistress of L'ecole Superior et al steps up. Behind her, the picture window displays the expanse of Slate City: The twin Slatescrapers framing endless rows of little tract houses stretching to the distant volcanic ridge. HEADMISTRESS  Sank you, ladies and gentlemen. An' sank you, Monsieur Slate for zis lovely setting. Zoot alors, zis will ze mos' fantas'tic recital in Bedrock 'istoree. Now, I would like to sank out mos' generous benefactress, Madame Slate for her fine support o'vair zee years -- She gestures into the audience, where Mrs. Slate stands, waves a gloved hand like the Queen Mother.

BARNEY => We just tell Mister Slate that all 500 acres of his development are going to crumble into dust any minute. (holds up the flit gun) Then we zap the stairs and corridors with some of this coo-coo sap. I just hope we have enough to get everybody out -- whoops!
BARNEY => Hang on, hang on --
near collisions. => CUT TO: "Rockdonald's" is, of course, complete with golden arches of stone, a drive-up window, etc. It even has the oblig- atory cops on a break... in this case, Feldspar and Gravel. They're sitting in their patrol car eating from little bamboo containers shaped just like McDonald's Styrofoam. (Of course, the logo on the building behind them proudly reads "OVER 100 SOLD.") FELDSPAR  Speed traps again! Face it, Gravel. I'm in a rut... and meanwhile, the guys who went through the academy with me, they're all big shots now: Sam Slate... Dirty Harock... Magma, P.I.

GRAVEL => S-sarge, d-did you see that? Some sorta creature was attacking that little guy -- ! FELDSPAR There's a lesson there, Gravel... never pick up hitchhikers. Besides --  -- Did you say 'creature'?
FELDSPAR => This is a xenosaurus alert. Repeat, a xenosaurus alert. The creature has been sighted on the Slate City exit of the Venturock Freeway! It is driving a brown late model sedan and eating a white male Caucasian. Car twelve is in hot pursuit. He releases the bird, which doesn't fly away right away, but gives him a look.
FELDSPAR =>  Oh, yeay... over and out!
DISPATCH PARAKEET =>  Awwk! Car Twelve is on the way. Car Twelve is on the way...
FELDSPAR =>  Gravel, this could mean promotions for both of us! (trotting up to speed) Load the shotgun and turn on the siren!

Slate Needle. => We hear a SCREECH and then the CAMERA PANS BACK to pickup Fred's CAR as it whips around a turn, two wheels off the ground. It crashes right into the gate, knocking down a sign reading "SLATE CITY--DELIVERY GATE." The fence collapses all around the car.
still intact. => BARNEY  We'd better split up; that way at least one of us can make it to the Slate Needle -- !
FRED => 'Ood hidea.   Ood whuk, ol' bhudee. They slap hands together like basketball players, then head off in two directions.
CUT TO => CAMERA PANS the audience as the accordion recital con- tinues. Several people look visibly ill. Finally, CAMERA ADJUSTS to take in Poindexter's big finish as he slides forward on his knees. There's a scattering of half-hearted applause, led by Lava and the Slates.

KIDS => You can keep the twist, the frug and hop --

MRS. SLATE => I'll tell you what's wrong! This 'act' is an absolute disgrace! This is supposed to be a talent show!  And a pedestrian animal act like this belongs in a circus!
BETTY => A circus, huh? Well, if our kids belong in a circus with their act, then your little nephew belongs in a zoo with his -- WILMA Yeah -- a zoo where the animals are dead -- because if they aren't, they will be! MRS. SLATE Why, how dare you! Mrs. Flintstein, I'll have you know that my little Poindexter has been trained by the finest tutors! Poindexter! Show them! Encore!
MRS. SLATE =>  Ah... Poindexter... that's enough ... Poindexter...?

He shines his light on Fred's big "clawprints." GRAVEL Holy cowasaurus! Look how deep these tracks are! That xeno thing must weigh a ton! They aim their lights at the tracks, begin to follow them. Suddenly they round a corner and come face to face with -- 240   NEW ANGLE - FRED                                           240
FELDSPAR => Okay, lizard, reach for the sky! Fred hesitates... then, hearing a CREAK and GROAN, he looks at the HOUSE beside him. The stucco-like exterior of Fibrerock is beginning to crumble.
GRAVEL =>  O-one flick of his paw... and he knocked down a wall -- ! FRED Nogh, wate, chum baggk -- As Fred "roars" and moves forward, Feldspar and Gravel scream, panic, and run! 241   FRED                                                           241 Tries to catch up and collides with the already damaged house. It collapses totally, falling in on itself, obscuring Fred. Finally the last TIMBER DROPS. Pause. Fred staggers out of the rubble, realizes that the impact has knocked the monster mask off his head and back on its hinges. He rubs dust out of his eyes, turns and looks at the Slate Needle. He's much closer to it now.
FRED => Barney!    The elevator -- !
FRED => Quick!    Use your coo-coo gun -- !

FELDSPAR => Chief, you -- you gotta believe me -- just one swipe of its paw and -- wham -- a whole house was pre-history -- ! Suddenly one of those police DISPATCH PARAKEETS comes flying excitedly through the window, lands on a perch in front of the Chief.
DISPATCH PARAKEET => Calling all cars. Calling all cars. Unconfirmed reports of destruction and collapse at Slate City. Rescue vehicles are on the way. The xenosaurus has been spotted in the area. That is all. That is all. FELDSPAR  You see -- ? I told you -- CHIEF All right, Feldspar, I'm convinced! As of this moment you're completely in charge of operation...  ... 'Xeno Dino'! Now, what do you need? CAMERA TIGHTENS ON Feldspar.     This is the moment he's waited for all his life.

SLATE => What the devil's going on here? FRED It's real simple, Mister Slate. Your boy Lava here has been stealing the coo-coo berries from the Fibrerock mix and fixing the books to hide it!
LAVA => That's ridiculous, Flintstone! Nobody could get that many coo-coo berries off our premises! 
BETTY =>  These sure look like coo-coo berries to me --
LAVA =>  They're convincing fakes, Mrs. Rubble -- part of our exciting display -- PYRITE Fakes?  Gee, Pilty, I thought the real ones were gonna be moved up here for us ta steal -- whatta waste a time --
PILTDOWN => Pyrite, shaddup -- FRED  Now I remember! These guys were pulling this xenosaurus act that night at the plant! What's this, Lava... 'Plan B'? LAVA Uncle! Are you going to stand there while aspersions are being cast at the Slate family? This is absurd --

Then Barney and Fred stand back nobly, wave everyone on into the adjacent Fibresphere.
POINDEXTER =>  Outta the way -- outta the way -- women and children first -- ! I mean, ah, children and women first, yeah, yeah, provided that uh, there's room for the women...
