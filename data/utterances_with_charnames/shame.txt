DAVID => Now, some inane kid snorting the entire load of his mother's spice cupboard and posts that on You Tube. They would watch as it would become the buzzword amongst high school kids everywhere. Eventually..their cynicism would turn to awe.

SISSY => Don't you think that's sad? Don't you think that's sad? You're my brother.
BRANDON => Why is it always so dramatic with you? Everything is always the end of the world.
SISSY => It's not fucking dramatic. I'm trying to talk to you!
