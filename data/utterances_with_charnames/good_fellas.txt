HOOD => Billy. You look beautiful. Welcome home.
BAITS =>  What are you having? Give 'em what they're drinking.
BILLY => Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
TOMMY =>  Billy, how are you?
BILLY =>  Son of a bitch. Get over here.
TOMMY =>  Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
BILLY =>  Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
TOMMY => Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
BILLY =>  Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
BILLY =>  You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
TOMMY =>  No more shines, Billy.
BILLY => Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.
BILLY =>  Now get the hell home and get your shine box.
HENRY =>  Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.
TOMMY => I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
HENRY => Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
TOMMY =>  He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
HENRY => Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
TOMMY =>  Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
HENRY =>  Batts. I'm sorry.  Tommy gets loaded.  He doesn't mean any disrespect.
BATTS => He's got a hot head.
BATTS => They're fucking mutts.
BUTTS => I seen them.    They walk around like big shots and they don't know shit.
JIMMY => A guy gets half a load on.  He mouths off.
BATTS => When I was a kid, I swear on my mother, you mouth off, you got your fucking legs broke.
JIMMY =>  Quick! Lock the door.
HENRY => What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
JIMMY =>  Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
TOMMY => I didn't want to get blood on your floor.
HENRY => Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
TOMMY => There's a shovel at my mother's.
TOMMY => SSHHH. You'll wake 'er up.
MOTHER =>  Have some more. Yon hardly touched anything. Did Tommy tell you about my painting? Look.
MOTHER =>  They want me to do a portrait next. I'm gonna do the Moan Lisa.
TOMMY => Jesus Christ! Miserable bastard!
TOMMY =>  Can you believe this no-good fuck? The prick! He's still alive.
TOMMY => Rat bastard.  No-good, low-life fuck.
HENRY => As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.
HENRY => To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United States.
HENRY => Even before I first wandered into the cabstand for an after-school job, I knew I wanted to be a part of them. It was there I belonged.
HENRY => To me it meant being somebody in a neighborhood full of nobodies.
HENRY => They weren't like anyone else. They did whatever they wanted. They'd double-park in front of the hydrant and nobody ever gave them a ticket.  In the summer when they played cards all night, nobody ever called the cops.
HENRY => Tuddy Vario ran the cabstand and a pizzeria and a few other places for his brother, Paul, who was the boss over everybody in the neighborhood.
HENRY => Paulie might have moved slow, but it was only because he didn't have to move for anybody.
HENRY => At first, my parents loved that I found a job across the street. My father, who was Irish, was sent to work at the age of eleven, and he liked that I got myself a job. He always said American kids were spoiled lazy.
CARMELLA =>  Come on. Come on. You'll all be late.
HENRY => And my mother was happy after she found out that the Varios came from the same part of Sicily as she did. To my mother, it was the answer to her prayers.
HENRY => I was the luckiest kid in the world.
HENRY => I could go anywhere.
HENRY => I could do anything.
HENRY => I knew everybody and everybody knew me.
HENRY => But it wasn't too long before my parents changed their minds. For them, the cabstand was supposed to be a part-tie job, but  for me, it was full-time.
TODDY =>  Okay.
HENRY => People like my father could never understand, but I was a part of something. I belonged.  I was treated like a grown-up. Every day I was learning to score.
FATHER =>  Did you study hard in school today? Did you learn a lot? Huh?
FATHER => I can't hear you, you little liar.  I got this from the school. They say you haven't been there in months.
FATHER =>  Little lying bastard.
HENRY => My father was always pissed off. He was pissed that he had to work so hard. He was pissed that he made such lousy money. Be was pissed that there were seven of us living in a tiny house. But after a while, he was mostly pissed that I hung around the cabstand. He said they were bums and that I was a bum. He said I was going to get into trouble.  I used to say I was only running errands after school, but he knew better.  He knew what went on at the cabstand and, every once in a while, usually after he got his load on, I had to take a beating. But by then, I didn't care. No matter how many beatings I took, I wouldn't listen to what he said.  I don't think I even heard him. The way I saw it, everybody has to take a beating some time.
TODDY => What happened to you?
HENRY => I can't make any more deliveries.
TODDY => Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
HENRY => My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
HOOD #1 =>  Is that the one?
HENRY => NO.
HOOD 2 =>  Him?
HENRY => No.  There. That's him. That's the guy.
TODDY =>  You know this kid?
MAILMAN =>  Yes.
TUDDY => You know where he lives?
TODDY => You deliver mail to his house?
TODDY => From now on, any letters to the kid from his school come directly here. Do you understand? One more letter from the school to the kid's house and ...
TODDY => ... you're going in the oven head- first.
RENKY => That was it. No more letters from truant officers. No more letters from school. In fact, no more letters from anybody. How could I go back to school after that and pledge allegiance to the flag and sit through good government bullshit.
HENRY => Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie and he got a piece of everything they made. It was tribute, just like the old country, except they were doing it in America.  All they got from Paulie was protection from other guys looking to rip them off. That's what it's all about. That's what the FBI can never understand -- that what Paulie and the organization does is offer protection for people who can't go to the cops. They're like the police department for wiseguys.
TODDY =>  I'll be up at the corner.
HENRY => People locked at me differently. They knew I was with somebody.
HENRY => I didn't have to wait on line at the bakery on Sunday morning anymore for fresh bread. The owner knew who I was with, and he'd come from around the counter, no matter how many people were waiting.  I was taken care of first.
HENRY => Our neighbors didn't park in our driveway anymore, even though we didn't have a car. At thirteen, I was making more money than most of the grownups in the neighborhood. I had more money than I could spend. I had it all.
HENRY => One day some of the kids from the neighborhood carried my mother's groceries all the way home for her. It was out of respect.
MOTHER =>  My God!  You look like a gangster.
MAN =>  I've been shot! Help!  Help!
TUDDY =>  Close the door. Don't let him in.
HENRY =>  It's okay. It's okay. They're getting an ambulance.
HENRY => It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
TODDY =>  You're some fucking jerk.
TODDY => I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
HENRY => I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
HENRY => It was a glorious time. Wiseguys were all over the place. It was before Apalachin and before Crazy Joey decided to take on a boss and start a war. It was when I met the world.  It was when I first met Jimmy Burke.
HENRY => He couldn't have been more than twenty-four or twenty-five at the time, but he was already a legend. He'd walk in the door and everybody who worked the room went wild. He'd give the doorman a hundred just for opening the door.  He shoved hundreds in the pockets of the dealers and who ran the games. The bartender got a hundred just for keeping the ice cubes cold.
JIMMY =>  Hey, kid! Get me a seven and seven.
VARIO =>  Henry. Say hello to Jimmy Burke.
JIMMY =>  Keep 'em coming.
HENRY => Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
HENRY => And almost all of them were gimmie's.
HENRY => They called him Jimmy the Gent. The drivers loved him. They used to tip him off about the really good loads. Of course, everybody got a piece. And when the cops assigned a whole army to stop him,  Jimmy made them partners.
JIMMY => Tommy. Help the lady.
SCHOOL-CROSSING GUARD =>  Thank you, sweetheart.
JIMMY =>  Say hello to Tommy. You'll do good together.
COP #1 => Anything good?
DETECTIVE #1 => What do you think you're doing?
DETECTIVE #2 => Where did you get these cigarettes? (offering them cartons) It's okay.
JUDGE => Councilor, proceed.
HENRY => By the time I grew up, there was thirty billion a year in cargo moving through Idlewild Airport and we tried to steal every bit of it.
HENRY => You've got to understand, we grew up near the airport.. It belonged to Paulie. We had friends and relatives who worked all over the place and they tipped as off about what was coming in and what was going out.
HENRY => If any of the truckers or airlines gave as trouble, Paulie had his people scare then with a little strike. It was beautiful. It was an even bigger money-major than numbers, and Jimmy was in charge. Whenever we needed money, we'd rob the airport. To us, it was better than Citibank.
DRIVER =>  Hurry, gimme the phone. Two niggers just stole my track.
HENRY => There was Jimmy and Tommy and me. And there was Anthony Stabile, Angelo Sepe, Fat Andy, Frankie the Wop, Freddy No Nose, Pete the Killer, Nicky Blanda, Mikey Franzese, and Johnny Echoes, who got that nickname because he said everything twice.  Like*, "You wanna get the papers, get the papers."
MAN =>  Sonny, we got the coats.
SONNY =>  You got any suits?
HENRY => Not till Thursday.
SONNY =>  I need suits.
HENRY => For us to live any other way was nuts. To us, those goody-good people who worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks, who took the subway to work every day and worried about their bills, were dead. They were suckers. They had no balls. If we wanted something, we just took it. If anyone complained twice, they got hit so bad they never complained again. It was routine. You didn't even think about it.
FRENCHY =>  It's all there. I can get you past the alarms and I can get the key.
TOMMY =>  It's okay.  Put it on the tab.
SONNY =>  Tommy, it's not just this.  Tommy, please. It's seven grand here.
SONNY =>  Tommy, I need the money, Tommy, please. I owe the world.
TOMMY =>  Ungrateful fuck!  I oughta break your fucking legs!
FRENCHY =>  Hey, Tommy. Have a drink.
VARIO =>  If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
SONNY =>  But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
VARIO => You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
SONNY => But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
VARIO => You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
SONNY =>  But, Paulie, please.
VARIO =>  Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
SONNY =>  Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
VARIO =>  What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?
HENRY =>  Tell him. It's okay.
VARIO => What?
SONNY => I was thinking that maybe you could come in with me. Take a piece of the place. If you were with me, maybe than they'd have to lay off.
VASIO => What, do I need ...
SONNY =>  I mean it. We could do good.
VARIO => You want a partner?
SONNY => Please?
HENRY => Now the guy's got Paulie for a partner. Any problems, he goes to Paulie. Trouble with the bill?  He can go to Paulie. Trouble with the cops? Deliveries? Tommy? He can call Paulie.
HENRY => But now the guy has got to come up with Paulie 's money every week, no matter what. Business bad? Fuck you, pay me. You had a fire?  Fuck you, pay ma.  The place got hit by lighting? Fuck you, pay me.  Also, Paulie could do anything. Especially run up bills on the joint's credit. Why not? Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.
HENRY => As soon as the deliveries are made in the front door, you move the stuff out the back and sell it at a discount. You take a two hundred dollar case of booze and sell it for a hundred. It doesn't matter. It's all profit.
HENRY => And, finally, when there's nothing 1 left, when you can't borrow another buck from the bank or buy another case of booze, you bust the joint out.
HENRY => You light a match.
TOMMY =>  You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
HENRY =>  Will you get the fuck out of here.
TOMMY => Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
HENRY => Tommy  ...
TOMMY =>  I swear you don't have to do nothing. You just show up and then leave. What do you think, I want you around? All I need is for you to get me started.
HENRY => I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
KAREN =>  Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
HENRY => I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.
TOMMY =>  Isn't she great? Isn't this great? Let's do it tomorrow night? Okay?
KAREN => I couldn't stand him.  I thought he was really obnoxious. He kept fidgeting around.
KAREN => Before it was even time to go home he was pushing me into the car ...
KAREN => ... and then pulling me out.  It was ridiculous. But Diana and Tommy had made us promise to meet them again on Friday night. We agreed. Of course, when Friday night came around, Henry stood me up.
KAREN => We were a trio instead of double- date that night, but I made Tommy take me looking for him.
KAREN =>  You've got some nerve. Standing me up. Nobody does that to me. Who do you think you are? A big shot?
HENRY =>  I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
KAREN => Liar!
HENRY => Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
HENRY => She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
KAREN =>  Talk? To you? After what you did!
HENRY => I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
HENRY => Come on, let me make it up.
KAREN =>  Button year shirt, quick!  Hurry
KAREN => Ma, this is my friend, Henry Hill.
MOTHER => My daughter says you're half-Jewish?
KAREN => What're you doing? What about the car?
HENRY =>  He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
KAREN =>  You gave them twenty dollars each?
CAPTAIN => This is from Mister Tony, over there.
HENRY => Where, over there?
CAPTAIN => Over there, over there.
KAREN => What do you do?
HENRY =>  I'm in construction.
KAREN =>  They don't feel like you're in construction.
HENRY => I'm a union delegate.
HENRY => Air France made me. We walked out with four hundred and twenty thousand dollars without a gun. And we did the right thing.
VARIO =>  It's a lot of money for a kid. If anyone asks, just say you won it shooting crap.
KAREN =>  No.  No.  You've got to sign for it.
KAREN =>  He lives across the street.
KAREN => One night Billy Daniels sent us champagne. There was nothing like it.  I didn't think that there was anything strange in any of this -- you know, a twenty-one-year-old kid with such connections.
KAREN => He was an exciting guy. He was really nice. He introduced me to everybody. Everybody wanted to be nice to him. And he knew how to handle it.
MARTY'S TV => They'll stay put even in a typhoon. And I should know. I'm the president of the company."
MARTY. =>  He wants three points over the vig.  From me?   I don't believe this shit?
HENRY =>  Marty.  Please.  You know Jimmy. You borrowed his money.  Pay 'em.
MARTY =>  I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
HENRY =>  What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
MAJKTY => Fuck 'em.  I never paid points.  I always did the right thing. Did I ever bust his balls?  Did I?  Did I?  I could have dropped a dime a million times,  and I wouldn't have had to pay dick.
HENRY =>  Marty, you're talking crazy. Drop a dime? Call the cops? Don't even let anybody hear such bullshit. Hey don't you just pay the man his money and shut the fuck up.
JIMMY =>  You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
HENRY => Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
MARTY =>  It's for you.
HENRY =>  Wait there.
KAREN =>  I've known him all my life. He just started grabbing at me. He wouldn't stop. And when I hit him across the nose with my shoe, he got mad and shoved me over.
HENRY => Go inside. I'll be right there.
KAREN => What are you gonna do?
HENRY => Get inside!
BRUCE => What do you want?
BRUCE =>  Hey!  Fucko! You want something?
WOMAN =>  HELP! Police! He's got a gun! Police!  Quick!  Murder!
HENRY =>  Here, hold this.
KAREN => I know there are women,  like my best friends, who would have gotten out of there the minute their boyfriend gave them a gun to hide. "Fha!  You and your gun. Get out of here, who needs you?"  That's what they would have said to him. But I didn't. I've got to admit the truth.  It turned me on.
KAREN => It was like he had two families. The first time I was introduced to them all at once, it was crazy. Paulie and his brothers had lots of sons and nephews and almost all of them were named Peter or Paul. It was unbelievable. There must have been two dozen Peters and Pauls at the wedding. Plus, they were all married to girls named Marie, and they named all their daughters Marie. By the time I finished meeting everybody. I thought I was drunk.
VARIO => Here.  This is for you.
KAREN =>  Paulie, you shouldn't.
KAREN =>  My bag. My bag.
HENRY =>  What bag?
KAREN =>  The bag with the envelopes.
HENRY =>  Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
KAREN'S MOTHER => He didn't call?
KAREN => He's with his friends.
KAREN'S MOTHER => What kind of person doesn't call?
KAREN => He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
KAREN'S MOTHER => If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
KAREN => Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
KAREN'S MOTHER =>  Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
KAREN'S MOTHER => He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
KAREN => Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
KAREN'S MOTHER => Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
KAREN => Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
KAREN'S MOTHER => Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
KAREN => Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
KAREN'S MOTHER =>  Where were you? Where have you been? Why didn't you call? We were all worried to death! A married man doesn't stay out like this!
KAREN'S MOTHER =>  Normal people don't live this way.
KAREN => We weren't married to nine-to-five guys, but the first time I realized how different was when Mickey had a hostess party.
MICKEY =>  Angie, sweetheart, you want it fluff?
ANGIE => He's the one with the hands. I'd like to smack his face.
WOMAN #1 => The red-haired guy?  He looks a like a farmer?
ANGIE => Sonofabitch.  I swear.  You can't go through the gate without his hands.  I told him.  Keep' your fucking hands off, you Sonofabitch, or I'll cut them off.
ANGIE) => He don't know bow lucky he is. It I just mentioned it to Vince, I don't even want to know.
WOMAN #1 => That's the problem.  How can you mention it? Vince 'd kill him.
ANGIE => You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
MICKEY =>  Look at Jeannie's kid.
ANGIE => What? What happened?
MICKEY => The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
ANGIE => But he was always a bad kid, that one.
MICKEY => No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
KAREN =>  They had bad skin and wore too much makeup. I mean they didn't look very good. They looked beat- up.
KAREN => You never saw teeth like that where I was growing up and the stuff they wore was thrown together and cheap. A lot of pants suits and double-knits. And they talked about how rotten their kids were and about beating them with broom handles and leather belts, but that the kids still didn't pay any attention. When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.
KAREN => I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
HENRY =>  Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
HENRY => Listen, we're beginning to make real money for the first time. It's business. Do you think I'm going to walk away from that?
KAREN => After a while, it all got to be normal. None of it seemed like crimes. It was more that Henry was enterprising. That he and the guys were making a few bucks hustling, while other men were sitting on their asses waiting for handouts. Our husbands weren't brain surgeons. They were blue collar guys, and the only way they could get extra money, real extra money, was to go out and cut a few corners.
KAREN => And we were also very close. I mean, there were never any outsiders around. Absolutely never!  And being together all the time made everything seem even more normal.
KAREN => There was always a little harassment. They always wanted to talk to Henry about this or that. They'd come with their subpoenas and warrants and make me sign. But mostly they were just looking for a handout. A few bucks to keep things quiet, no matter what they found.
KAREN =>  Can I make you some coffee?
KAREN => I always asked them if they wanted coffee. Some of the wives, like Mickey Burke, used to curse at them and spit on the floor. Imagine. She'd spit on her own floor. That never made any sense to me. It was better to be polite and call the lawyer.
KAREN => We  did everything together and we were always the same crowd. Anniversaries. Christenings.  We only want to each other's houses.
KAREN => The woman played cards.  When my kids were born. Jimmy and Mickey were always the first at the hospital.
KAREN => When we went to the Islands or Vegas for vacation, we always . went together.
KAREN => It got to ba normal. I got to where I was even proud that I had the kind of husband who was willing to go out and risk his neck just to get us the little extras.
KAREN => But I got my mother to watch the kids tomorrow night.
HENRY => I told you I can't.
KAREN =>  I'm gonna need some money.
HENRY => How much?
HENRY => For most of the guys, killing got to be accepted. They were routine. Murder was the only way everybody stayed in line. It was the ultimate weapon. Yon got out of line, you got whacked. Everyone knew the rules.
HENRY => But sometimes, even if people didn't get out of line, they'd get whacked. Hits just became a habit for some guys. It didn't take anything to get yourself killed.
HENRY => Guys would get into arguments over nothing and before you knew it, one of them was dead. They were shooting each other all the time. Shooting people was a normal thing. It was no big deal.
HENRY => You didn't have to do anything and nobody was immune. You just had to be there.
HENRY => But we had a problem with Billy Batts. This was a touchy thing. Tommy had killed a made man. Billy was a part of the Bambino crew and untouchable.
HENRY => Before you could touch a made guy, you had to have a good reason. There had to be a sit-down. And you better get an okay, or you'd be the one who got whacked.
HENRY => Saturday night was for wives, but Friday night at the Copa was always for the girlfriends.
GIRL #1 => Last week I saw Sunny Davis. What a performer. You gotta see him. You gotta catch him. He does imitations I swear you'd think it was the real people.
GIRL #2 => Yeah, the way he moves. It's unbelievable. I mean, you can understand how a white girl could fall for him.
TOMMY => What are you talking about?
GIRL #2 => I don't mean me.  Not me. I just mean, you can see how some girls could.  Like that Swedish girl. You can see how she fell for him. You can see how he has this, this, personality.
VARIO => What did you hear about that thing?
HENRY => What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
VARIO => No. No. The guy from downtown.
HENRY => The guy from near where Christie used to live?
VARIO => No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
HENRY => Oh I Him.
VASIO => You know the one I mean?
HENRY => Oh yeah. Sure. That guy. I know him.
VASIO => That Batts was a miserable fuck, but his people are looking still for him.
HENRY => Oh yeah. Yeah. I know. I even looked into it myself. Nobody knows what the fuck happened to him. He came in the joint that one night and then he disappeared.
VARZO => Hell, keep your eyes open. They're busting my balls looking for the fuck.
JIMMY => We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
HENRY =>  Paulie was just talking about him.
JIMMY => Well, we gotta dig him up again.
HENRY =>  What?
JIMMY => The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
HENRY =>  It's been six months.
JIMMY => It's still better than letting somebody find him.
HENRY =>  If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
JIMMY => Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
KAREN => What happened to the car? (annoyed at Karen's prying) I hit a skunk.
HENRY => I set up Linda in an apartment around the corner from the Suite. That way I was able to stay over a couple of nights a week. Karen was home with the kids anyway and she never asked any questions anyway.
HENRY => Linda and I were having so much fun, she started screwing up at work, and I had to straighten out her boss a little bit.
TOMMY =>  Spider. C'mon, get me a seven and seven.
TOMMY => Spider, what did I say? Did I say I was dying over here? Come on. Move it. Don't walk, dance. (to his fellow players) Did you ever see in the cowboy movies where they make them dance? Did you see The Oklahoma Kid, the only cowboy movie Cagney ever made? Come on, dance, you varmit.
SPIDER => Tommy, don't fuck around.
TOMMY => Yahooo.
HENRY => Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
TOMMY => No, no. It's okay.
HENRY => Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
TOMMY => No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
HENRY => I gotta go out!
KABEN => Not tonight, you're not. Not without the car keys, you're not.
HENRY => Are you nuts?
KAREN => I don't care. Something's going on.
HENRY =>  That again.
KABEN =>  You're a liar. I look at you and I know you're a liar.
HENRY =>  I need some air.  I need a little peace. At least at home.
TOMMY => Hey!  Look at this.  Fred Astaira, back from the wars. Can you believe this guy? That bandage. It's bigger than his foot.
TOMMY => Spider. You're so full of shit. Even with that foot, I bet you can dance.
TOMMY => Come on. Spider.  Come on. Let's see you dance.
SPIDER => Why don't you go fuck yourself.
JIMMY =>  Hey,  Spider.  That's very good. Did you hear, Spider?  The kid's got balls.  See, the kid's got balls.  He's a good kid.
JIMMY =>  You going to take that shit from this punk?  This fuckin'  low-life. This kid's got bigger balls than you'll have any day.  He just got shot in the foot by you and he tells you to go fuck yourself.  I can't believe this shit. (to the crew, roaring with laughter) Can you believe this shit? (To Tommy, almost whispering) Tommy! You gonna take that shit from a punk?
JIMMY => All right, you dumb fuck, if you're going to be a big fuckin' wiseguy, you can dig the hole.
HENRY => After Billy Batts and Spider, everything was going crazy. Not just our crew, but everybody.
KAREN =>  Open up!  I know you're there! You stay away from my husband.
KAREN => She wouldn't open the door.  I rang her bell. Still, she wouldn't open.  I rang her bell for two hours, and she kept on hiding.
KAREN =>  Wake up.
HENRY =>  What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
KAREH =>  Crazy? I'm crazy enough to shoot you and her.
KAREN => But still I couldn't hurt him. How could I hurt him? I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.
HENRY =>  It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
KAREN => The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
HENRY =>  Son of a bitch.
HENRY =>  I don't need this bullshit. I got enough to worry about getting whacked on the street. I gotta come home to get whacked?
HENRY => I swear on my mother, I should kill you. You're fucking crazy.
HENRY =>  Honey.  Go get me some cigarettes.
VARIO =>  Karen's come to the house. She's very upset. It's no good. You gotta straighten this all out.
JIMMY => Things gotta be calm right now, and Karen's so high-strung. She's with Mickey every day. Who knows what she's gonna do?
VARIO => Jimmy and Tommy were supposed to pick up something in Tampa for me this weekend.
VARIO => You go with Jimmy, instead. Get away for a few days.  Relax.
VARIO => Enjoy yourselves. Have a good time. Then, when you get back Monday, you go home to Karen.
MAM =>  I ain't got it. I swear.
MAN =>  I can't.  I swear.
JIMMY => we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
HENRY =>  What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
JIMMY => We only have to shove'em over the moat.
HENRY => They must really feed each other to the lions down there, because the guy gave the money right up and we got to spend the rest of the weekend at the track. (pause and genuine shock) But then, I couldn't believe what happened.
HENRY => When we got home, we were all over the newspapers. At first, I didn't even know why we got picked up.
HENRY => Then, I found out, that the guy we roughed up turned out to have a sister working as a typist for the FBI.
HENRY => Who could believe it? Of all the fucking people. She gave up everybody.  Jimmy.  Me. Even her brother.
HENRY => It took the jury six hours to bring us in guilty. The judge gave Jimmy and me ten years like he was giving away candy.
KAREN =>  I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
HENRY => I'm just having my last few drinks.
KAREN => I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
HENRY => Shit.
TOMMY => Say hello to Jimmy.
HENRY =>  Okay, now you can take me to jail.
HENRY => Dinner was always a big thing. We had a pasta course and then meat or fish.  Paulie did the prep work. He was doing a year for contempt and he had a system for doing garlic. He used a razor and he sliced it so thin it used to liquify in the pan with a little oil.
HENRY => Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.  I felt he put in too many onions, but it was a good sauce anyway.
HENRY => Johnny Dio did the meat. He didn't have a broiler, so Johnny did everything in pans.  He smelled up the joint something awful and the hacks used to die.
HENRY => Everybody else in the joint was doing real time, all mixed together, living like pigs.
HENRY => We lived alone, we owned the joint. Even those hacks who we couldn't bribe would never rat on the guys who did.
HENRY =>  Nice? Good?
VARZO =>  Okay. What else?
VARIO =>  Now we eat.
GUARD => Are there any more?
HENRY =>  No, that's it. Ho more today.
KAREN =>  You son of a bitch. She's been here.
HENRY =>  What are you talking about?
KAREN =>  Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
HENRY => Jezuz Christ!
KAREN => You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
HENRY =>  What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
KAREN => You want her?  Good!  Let her sneak this stuff in for you!
KAREN => Let her fight with these creep bastards every week to make life easier for you!
HENRY =>  Stop! Stop!
KAREN => Let her carry this shit inside.
KAREN =>  Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
HENRY =>  It'll be okay.
KAREN => He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
HENRY => We've got to help each other.
KAREN => Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
HENRY => It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
KAREN =>  I can't do it anymore.
HENRY => Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
KAREN => I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
HENRY => Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
KAREN =>  I don't want to hear about her anymore.
HENRY =>  Never.
HENRY =>  Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
KAREN => With what?
HENRY =>  Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
KAREN => But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
HENRY => Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.
VARIO => I don't want any more of that Shit.
HENRY => Wha?  Me?
VARIO => Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
HENRY =>  Me? Why would I get into that shit?
VARIO =>  I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
HENRY => Why would I get into that?
VARZO => Don't make me a fool. You know what I mean, from now on, you gotta be careful. Just don't mess around with that shit, and watch out for Jimmy. Jimmy's a good earner, but he's sometimes too hungry. He's wild.  He does foolish things. Jimmy is not a businessman. As good as he is, he takes too many chances.
HENRY => I know that.  I know Jimmy. You think I'd take chances like Jimmy?
VARZO => And that Tommy. He's a good kid, but he's crazy. He's a cowboy. He's got too much to prove. You got to watch out for kids like that.
HENRY => Paulie, I know.  I know what they are. But I use them for certain things.  Please. Believe me, you don't nave to worry.
VARIO =>  I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
HENRY => Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
VARIO => You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
HENRY => Nods.
VARIO => And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
HENRY => Nods again.
VARIO =>  Anybody!  You understand?
HENRY => I understand.
HENRY => It took me about a week of sneaking around before I could unload the Pittsburgh stuff without Paulie finding out. But when I did, it was a real score.  I started using Robin's place to mix the stuff and even with Robin's snorting more than she mixed, I could see this was a good business. I made twelve thousand dollars in my second week and I had a down-payment on my house. All I had to do was every once in a while, tell Robin I loved her.
HENRY => It was perfect. As long as I kept getting the stuff from Pittsburgh, I knew Paulie would never find out. But within a couple of weeks it got to be so big I needed help. I got Jimmy and Tommy to come in with me.
HENRY => Fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty- one-five.
HENRY =>  Did I tell you?
JIMMY => Nice.
TOMMY => Who's buying?
PAROLE OFFICER =>  Burke?
PAROLE OFFICER => Still working?
KAREN => This we had to have made special. I mean, sit in it. Go ahead. Sit.
KAREN => The others you couldn't even sit in.  And from here, watch the wall.
KAREN => See. It opens. We had the electricians fix it up special.
KAREN => This we imported. It came in two pieces.
MARTY => It's a fait accompli?
HENRY => Done.
MARTY => And Jimmy's in it, right?
HENRY => Will you stop.
HASTY => But you don't understand.  It's worth millions. It's once in a
MARTY => Lifetime. We'll be rich. No more nut every week. I've been cultivating this thing for two years.
HENRY => And these are the guys.
HENRY => Tommy and Sepe were going to grab the outside guard and make him get us in the front door.
HENRY => Frenchy and
HENRY => Joe Buddha had to round up the workers.
HENRY => Fat Louis had to keep than tied up and away from alarms.
HENRY => Only Marty was driving us nuts. He was busting Jimmy's balls for an advance on the money we were going to steal.
HENRY => Even Stacks got in on it.  He was supposed to steal the panel truck and afterwards compact it by a friend of ours in Jersey.
HENRY => I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
KAREN =>  She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
HENRY =>  Hello!  Hello!  Have a good flight?
JUDY => I hate Pittsburgh.
JUDY => Where'd you find such creeps?
HENRY => They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
KAREN =>  Is this the same one as last time?
JUDY =>  No. That one was my sister's. This is Louise's.
KAREN => Look at her, Henry, is she sweet? Doesn't she look like Judy?
JUDY => That's what the stewardess said.
HEHRY =>  Hey! Watch out.
ROBIN => Stay there.
HENRY => Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this. (sticking his finger under Robin's nose) There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
ROBIN =>  I hate to do dishes.
HENRY =>  Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
ROBIN =>  So do I.
ROBIN => Are you okay? What happened?
HENRY => Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
JIMMY =>  Come here.  Look at this genius.
FAT LOUIE =>  Come outside.  I gotta show you. Just for a minute.
FAT LOUIE => Is that beautiful? I got it for Dolores.
JIMMY =>  You fucking nuts? Didn't I say not to go buy anything for a while? You got a fucking car?
FAT LOUIE =>  Don't get excited. It's okay. My mother bought it for us. It's a wedding present. It's in her name.
JIMMY => You're crazy. The bulls are across the street. They're watching everything we do.
JIMMY =>  The fat fuck ought to wear a sign.
JIMMY => Jesus Christ!  Are you all fucking nuts?
SEPE =>  What's the matter with him?
SEPE => Hey? What the fuck are you doing?
MRS. SEPE =>  Angelo!  He's taking my coat! Angelo!
JIMMY =>  Didn't I tell you not to get anything big? Didn't I tell you not to attract attention? In two days, one fuck buys a Caddy and another buys a ten thousand dollar mink.  Can you believe this shit? (to Sepe, with some menace) Now get the fuck home and get rid of the coat. Bring it back to where you got it. I don't care what you do, just get rid of it.
MRS. SEPE =>  I'm not giving it back. Angelo? Do you hear me?
SEPE => Did I tell you to shut up? Shut up!
JIMMY =>  Fucking guys.  Can you believe them.  I told them all: Don't . attract attention.  Act normal.
MARTY => Oh!  There you are.  I've been looking all over for you two.
MARTY => Listen, I need it, Jimmy.  I need it all.
HEHRY => Marty.  Relax.  You saw some money.
MARTY =>  But I need it all.  I owe people too, you know.
MARTY => Jimmy.  Wait.  Listen.  Please!
MARTY => I want to talk to Jimmy.
HENRY => He heard.
MARTY => But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
HENRY =>  Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
JIMMY => For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.
HENRY => Jimmy.
JIMMY =>  We did it.  We did it.
MALE => Hey, Jimmy. Jimmy.
JIMMY => Yeah, yeah.  I'll be right there.
HENRY => Hey!  Look what I got. The most expensive tree they had.
HENRY => Go buy yourself a coat.
HENRY => Lufthansa should have been our ultimate score. The heist of a lifetime. Six million in cash. More than enough to go around.
TOMMY => Hey!  Stacks! Come on! Open the door! Wake up!
TOMMY => Come on! Come on! We got some coffee.
ANGELO => You got coffee?
STACKS => Fucks! You said you had coffee.
TOMMY =>  Put on a pot.
STACKS =>  Ball-busting sons of bitches.
HENRY => Stacks was always crazy. Instead of getting rid of the truck like he was supposed to, he got stoned, went to his girlfriend's and by the time he woke up, the cops had found the truck. It was all over the television. They even said they came up with prints off the wheel. It was just a matter of tine before they got to Stacks.
JIMMY =>  Give'm a drink.
HENRY =>  I gotta talk to you.
JIMMY =>  Have a drink first.
HENRY => I still gotta talk to you.
JIMMY =>  Oh yeah? Anything you say.
HENRY => What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
JIMMY =>  Don't worry about it.
HENRY => There are cops all over the place.
JIMMY =>  So what?  Where are they gonna go?
JIMMY =>  He's worried.
TOMMY =>  Come on. Don't worry so fucking much. Things are beautiful.  Didn't you tell him?
JIMMY =>  Not yet.
JIMMY => Tommy's gonna be made.
HENRY =>  Paulie's gonna make him?
JIMMY =>  Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
MARTY =>  Jimmy, can I talk to you now?
MARTY =>  Hey! Come on, already. If it wasn't for me, none of you would have had anything.
HENRY =>  Will you shut your fucking mouth. You're gonna get your money, just stop busting balls. Okay? Relax. You hear? Everything's gonna be fine.
JIMMY =>  Son of a bitch. You're a pisser.
JIMMY => You wanna talk? Okay, come on, let's get it over with.  I swear I've never known a ball buster like you in all my life.
MARTY =>  Ah, but Jimmy, nobody loves you. like I do. You know that. You name it.  I'll do anything for you.
JIMMY =>  Except to stop busting my balls.
WOMAN => Open up.  Henry! Karen! It's me. Fran!
FRAN =>  Marty didn't come home. He's missing. I know something happened to him.
HENRY => Wait a minute.  Calm down.
KAREN => Fran. It'll be okay. Don't worry.
FRAN => I know something happened.
HENRY => What could happen? He got drunk. He passed out somewhere. I'll go looking for him in the morning.
FRAN => In twenty years he's never been away all night without calling. I know something's wrong.
HENRY => Awright, awright. Let me take you home and I'll go look for him myself. Right now.
HENRY => What'll I tell Fran?
JIMMY => Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
JIMMY => Watch this.
HENRY => Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
JIMMY => I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
HENRY => Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
JIMMY => Come on, fuckoes. Let's go for a ride. (to Henry as Jimmy starts his car) I keep 'em up all fuckin' night.
HENRY => Jimmy was cutting every link between himself and the robbery, but it had nothing to do with me. I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me some Christmas money. From then on I kept my mouth shut.  I knew Jimmy. He had the cash.  It was his. I know he kicked some money upstairs to Paulie, but that was it.  It made him sick to have to turn money over to the guys who stole it. He'd rather whack them. Anyway, what did I care? I wasn't. asking for anything and, besides. Jimmy was making nice money with me through my Pittsburgh connections. But still, for months after the robbery, they were finding bodies all over.
HENRY => When they found Sepe in the meat truck, he was frozen so stiff it took them two days to thaw him out for the autopsy.
HENRY => Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy. He was like a kid. We had money coming in through my Pittsburgh people and after a while even the Lufthansa thing began to calm down. But the thing that made Jimmy so happy that morning was that this was the day Tommy was being made.
HENRY => Jimmy was so excited, you'd think he was being made. He must have made four calls to Tommy's house. They had a signal all set up so he'd know the minute the ceremony. was over.-
JIMMY =>  You want the melon?
HENRY => Nah.
JIMMY =>  I better call again.
HENRY => Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
HENRY => It's the highest honor they can give you. It means you belong to a family and a crew. It means that nobody can fuck around with you. It also means you can fuck around with anybody, as long as they aren't also a member. It's like a license to steal.
HENRY => As far as Jimmy was concerned, with Tommy being made, it was like we were all being made. We would now have one of our own guys as a member.
HENRY => Except, they didn't make Tommy that day.
HENRY => They killed him. It was revenge for Billy Batts.
HENRY => And there was nothing we could do. Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't. We had to sit still and take it. It was among the Italians. It was real greaseball shit. They even shot Tommy in the face so his mother couldn't give him an open coffin at the funeral.
HENRY => I was going to be busy all day. I had to drop off some thirty-eights at Jimmy's to match some silencers he had gotten. I had to pick up my brother at the hospital and drive him back to the house for dinner and then I had to pick up some new Pittsburgh stuff for Judy to fly down to some customers I had near Atlanta.
JIMMY => What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
HENRY => Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
HENRY => I knew my Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns, and since I was going to see them later in the afternoon to pick up a delivery, I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.
HENRY => When I finally got there to pick up Michael, his doctor wanted to put me in bed. I told him about the accident.  I said I was partying all night.
HENRY => He took mercy on me. He gave me ten milligrams of Valium and sent me home. My plan was to drop off my brother at the house and pick up Karen.
HENRY =>  I think that helicopter's following me.
MICHAEL => Are you nuts?
HENRY => I was cooking dinner that night. I had to start braising the beef, pork butt and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.  It's Michael's favorite. I was making ziti with the meat gravy, and I'm planning to roast some peppers over the flames, and I was putting on some string beans with the olive oil and garlic, and I had some beautiful cutlets, cut just right, that I was going to fry up before dinner just as an appetizer.  I was home for about an hour. My plan was toStart the dinner early, so Karen and I could go unload the guns that Jimmy didn't want, and get the package for Judy to take to Atlanta latex that night. I kept looking out the window and the helicopter was gone. I asked Michael to watch the sauce, and Karen and I started out.
HENRY => We're going to your mother's.
HENRY => Now I'm sure we're being tailed. My plan was to go to her mother's and unload the guns. Who needed them in the trunk with all this heat?
HENRY =>  Go inside.  Tell her not to touch anything outside the house. Nothing.
HENRY => Let's go shopping.
HENRY => I'm not nuts. It's been following me all fucking morning.  I mean it.
HENRY =>  They think I'm paranoid. The dumb fucks.  I should bring them the helicopter, then we'll see how paranoid I am.
HENRY => Okay!  Quick! Let's get back to your mother's.
DEALER => Didn't I tell you you were paranoid? See, Karen, didn't I tall him he was paranoid?
KAREN =>  I need some coffee.
HENRY => My plan was I had to get home and get the package ready for Judy to take on her trip. Also, I had to get to Robin's house to give the package a whack with some quinine. Plus, I knew Robin was gonna get on my ass. Then I had the cooking to finish at home, and I had to get Judy ready for the trip.
DEALER =>  It's Robin.
HENRY =>  Yeah?
HENRY =>  A pain in the ass.  I'll see you in about an hour.  I can't. I got my brother home tonight.  We'll talk about it later. Okay?
HENRY => You ready?
JUDY => Yeah.
HENRY => Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.
JODY =>  Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
MICHAEL => I'm stirring.
HENRY =>  You know what to do?
JUDY =>  Yeah, yeah.
HENRY => Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
JUDY => Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
HENRY =>  Just make sure you do it. You know what I mean?
JDDY => Jesus Christ! You can be such a pain.
HENRY => Just do what I say!  Judy Okay.
MICHAEL =>  What'd he say?
JUDY => Nothing.
HENRY => So, what does she do after she hangs up with me? After everything I had told her? After all her yeah, yeah, yeah, bullshit? She picks up the phone and calls from the house. Now, if anybody was listening, they'd know everything. They'd know that a package was leaving from my house and they'd even have the time and the flight number. Thanks to her.
HENRY => As soon as I got home, I started cooking. I had a few hours until Judy's flight.  I told my brother to keep an eye on the stove. All day long, the poor guy's been watching helicopters and tomato sauce. I had to drive over to Robin's place, mix it once and get back to the gravy.
ROBIN =>  I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
HENRY =>  It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
ROBIN =>  Okay?
ROBIN =>  You bastard! Where are you going?
JUDY =>  I gotta go home.
HENRY => What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
JUDY => I gotta go home and get my hat.
ENRY => Forget your fucking hat. What are you, kidding me? Just what I need now is a trip to Rockaway. Just because you want your hat.
JUDY => I need it. I gotta have it. It's my lucky hat. I never fly without it.
HENRY => Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
JUDY => I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
HENRY => What could I do?  If she insisted, I had to drive her home for her goddamn hat.  I threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone.
MAN => One move, motherfucker, and I'll blow you away.
HENRY => For a second I thought I was dead, but when I heard all the noise, I knew they were cops,  only cops talk that way.  If they had been wiseguys, I wouldn't have heard a thing. I would have been dead.
HENRY => All day I thought the guys in the helicopter were just local cops busting my balls over Lufthansa, but they turned out to be Narks. They had been on me a month. Phone taps. Surveillance.
KAREN =>  Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
HENRY =>  What did he say, exactly?
KAREN =>  At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
HENRY =>  Paul will calm down. You'll see.
KAREN => I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
HENRY => Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
KAREN =>  Then you're safer in here.
HENRY =>  Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
KAREN =>  Who's gonna do that?
HENRY =>  Just get me out.
HENRY => Karen finally got her mother to put her house up for my bail. I was out.
HENRY => I remember I had this feeling I was going to get killed right outside the jail.  I knew Paulie was still pissed at me and he's such a hothead I was afraid he might have me whacked before he calmed down. And I was also worried about Jimmy. Jimmy knew if Paulie found out he was in the drug deals with me, Paulie would have Jimmy killed even before me. This is the bad time.  I didn't feel safe until I got home.
HENRY => So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
HENRY =>  Where's the stuff?
KAREN => What are you talking about?
HENRY => You know. The stuff I left.
KAREN =>  I flushed it down the toilet.
HENRY =>  You what?
KAREN =>  What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
HENRY => Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
KAREN =>  They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
HENRY => Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
KAREN =>  Oh no! No!  Noooo!
HEHRY =>  Why? Why?
VARIO =>  I warned you a million times.
HENRY => I've been all fucked up since I got out.
VARIO => You think I didn't know what you were doing?
HENRY => It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
VARIO => Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
HENRY => But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
VARIO => You thought I was some fucking jerk?
HENRY => Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
HENRY => Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
VARIO => You treated me like shit.
VARIO =>  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
HENRY => Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
KAREN => I'm not going to run. Live the rest of our lives like rats. Is that what, you want? Leave my mother. Leave my family.  Never see anybody again.
HOOD =>  We're gonna leave then anyway, because if we stay around here we're gonna be dead.
KAREN =>  They're right. You are paranoid.
JIMMY =>  How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
KAREN => He's okay. They sobered him up.
JIMMY => Did he say what they're asking him about?
KAREN => Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
JIMMY => I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
KAREN => He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
JIMMY => I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.
JIMMY =>  The third store down.
KAREN => Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
KAREN) => I got a bad feeling.  I just kept walking.
JIMMY =>  Inside! Go in there!
KAREN =>  Jimmy, I'm in a hurry.  I've got to pick up the kids at my mother's. I'll come back later.
HENRY => What happened? You okay?
KAREN => I got seared.
HENRY =>  Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
KAREN =>  I got scared.
HENRY => If you're part of a crew, nobody ever tells you that they're going to kill you.  It doesn't happen that way.  There aren't any arguments or curses like in the movies. Your murderers come with smiles. They come as your friends, the people who have cared for you all your life, and they always come at a time when you are at your weakest and most in need of their help. So I met Jimmy in a crowded place we both knew.  I got there fifteen minutes early and I saw that Jimmy was already there. He took the booth near the window so he could see everyone who drove up to the restaurant.  He wanted to see if I had been tailed.
JIMMY =>  You look good.
HENKF =>  I didn't need the headache.
JIMMY => Come on, eat something.
HENRY => I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
HENRY => He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
JIMMY =>  I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
HENRY => How?
JIMMY => It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
HENRY => Yeah.
JIMMY => He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
HENRY => Yeah.
JIMMY => I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.
HENRY => Jimmy had never asked me to whack somebody before, but now he's asking me to go down to Florida and do a hit with Anthony.
HENRY => That's when I knew I would never have come back from Florida alive.
MCDONALD => We'll pack up everything and send it to you.
KAREN => I got dry cleaning.
MCDONALD => We'll pick it up.
MCDONALD => We'll sell your house here and apply the money to your new name.
HENRY => I don't want to go anywhere it's cold.
MCDONALD => I can't control that.
HENRY => I don't care who controls it. Nowhere cold.
KAREN => He's very bronchial.
KAREN =>  What about the schools?
HENRY => Yeah. What about the kids' school?
MCDONALD => Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
KAREN => I don't want them left back.
MCDONALD => They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
KAREN => That's important.
HENRY => It was easy for all of us to disappear. My house was in my mother- in-law's name.  My cars were registered to my wife. My Social Security cards and driver's licenses were phonies.  I've never , voted. I never paid taxes. My birth certificate and my arrest sheet, that's all you'd ever have to know I was alive.
HENRY => The hardest thing for me was leaving the life. I still love the life. We were treated like movie stars with muscle.  We had it all just for the asking.
HENRY => Our wives, mothars, kids, everybody rode along. I had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen and a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed.
HENRY => Anything I wanted was a phone call away. Free cars and the keys to a dozen hideouts flats all over the city. I'd bet twenty, thirty grand over a weekend ...
HENRY => ... and than I'd either blow the winnings in a week or go to the sharks to pay back the bookies.
HENRY => It didn't matter. When I was broke I just went out and robbed some more. We ran everything.  We paid off lawyers. We paid off cops. Everybody had their hands out. And now it's all over.
HENRY => And that's the hardest part. Today everything is different. There's no action.
HENRY => I have to wait around like anyone else. Yon can't even get decent food. Right after I got hare I ordered some spaghetti with marinara sauce and I got egg noodles and ketchup.
HENRY =>  I'm an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life like a schnook.
