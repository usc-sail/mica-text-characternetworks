YOUNG EDWARD => Edward... Edward Carnby.

SMALL BOY => Did you have a nightmare?
SMALL BOY => You ate cheese with dinner. My mommy says cheese gives you nightmares. Want to see my coloring book?
SMALL BOY => I think there's a vampire living in my closet, but my mommy says vampires and ghosts aren't real. She says there's nothing to be afraid of in the dark.
CARNBY => Your mother is wrong. Being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive.
SMALL BOY => Everybody else tells me not to be afraid.
CARNBY => That's because they don't know the truth.
13                                                                      13 => Carnby exits the Terminal and heads over to a row of taxis waiting outside the Terminal. He doesn't carry a suitcase.
CARNBY => So, maybe you're thinking I'm an asshole, trying to scare this poor kid for no reason. But that's where you're wrong. Because I've got my reasons. There's a world around you that you've trained yourself not to see. You've willfully closed your eyes. But your fear of the dark is not a weakness. It's there to protect you from things you'd better pray you never see. My eyes were forced open a long time ago. Now I know. Just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it can't kill you.
13A                                                                    13A => Behind the wheel of the taxi sits JAMES PINKERTON (early 50s). His face is drawn, grim. He wears dark sunglasses.

CABBIE => You travel light.
CARNBY => Trust me, I'm carrying enough baggage for the both of us.
CABBIE => That's pretty funny, man. What do you do?
CARNBY => You really want to know?
CABBIE => Yeah, man. Hearing about my passengers' lives keeps the job interesting.
CARNBY => I'm a paranormal investigator.
CABBIE => Get the fuck outta here!
CABBIE => What does that mean exactly?
CARNBY => I'm an effective solution to unusual problems.
CARNBY => Speaking of which, that taxi's been following us since the airport.

GUARD => Got another delivery, Ms. Cedrac.
ALINE => I don't have anything scheduled. What museum was it transferred from?
DELIVERY GUY => For Dr. Hudgens, from Dr. Hudgens.
ALINE => It's probably an error. It must be for the big Abkani show.
DELIVERY GUY => Abkani? What the hell's Abkani?
GUARD => Ancient Native American civilization. They were this super-advanced culture, but something like ten thousand years ago, they just disappeared.
LINE => You've been reading up.
GUARD => Not much else to do around here at night.
DELIVERY GUY => Says here it's not to be opened by anyone but Dr. Hudgens.
GUARD => This is Aline Cedrac. She's the assistant curator.
ALINE => We've got Abkani artifacts coming in from museums around the world. Until Hudgens gets back, I'm doing all the cataloguing anyway.
GUARD => Where is Hudgens anyway? The show opens in a few days.
ALINE => Off on another archeological goosechase. He thinks he's finally found the Erebus.
GUARD => So he sticks you with the work. At least it keeps your mind off your boyfriend.
LINE => I'll be in my office if you need me.
DELIVERY GUY => What was that all about?
GUARD => Damn it... I shouldn't have said that. Her boyfriend's been missing for the last three months.
DELIVERY GUY => Nice going, jack-ass.
19                                                                    19 => A large Ship out on the open sea.
CAPTAIN CHERNICK => They say a sunken ship is like a grave. It should never be disturbed.

JOHN => Edward, John here. Hope things went well wherever you were this time. And, please, do not, I repeat, do not tell me about it. Every time you tell me about your latest case, I get nightmares for a week. Anyway, give me a call when you get back. Linda wants to have you by for dinner. Lord knows why, but she seems to like you. And if you haven't scared Aline away yet, bring her along.
24                                                                    24 => The Ship is docked at a mist-enshrouded pier. Overhead lights along the dock illuminate the area.

CAPTAIN CHERNICK => Don't you want to open it? Make sure it's what you're looking for?
HUDGENS => The conditions must be perfect. Otherwise, there will be... consequences.
CAPTAIN CHERNICK => Is this made of solid gold?
HUDGENS => Did you know the Abkani were the first civilization to use gold for their valuables? They believed it held the power to contain evil spirits. Thousands of years later, we don't even remember why gold was valuable to us in the first place. Now, let's load it onto the truck.
26A                                                                       26A => Carnby sits in his lab area, studying the lynchpin artifact under an illuminated magnifying lamp.

ALINE => The pictograms are late-period Abkani. It seems to be some sort of... prophecy. Shadows that make ghosts of men. The world of light consumed by darkness. This is the first indication I've ever seen that the Abkani had a myth about the end of the world.
26C                                                                    26C => Captain Chernick approaches Hudgens at the container. The First Mate and Crewman Barnes stand quietly behind them.
CAPTAIN CHERNICK => If the container's made of gold, whatever's inside must be worth a fortune.
HUDGENS => You have no idea...
CAPTAIN CHERNICK => But I'm looking forward to finding out.
HUDGENS => I suppose one should not be surprised when mercenaries act mercenary.
HUDGENS => You're making a terrible mistake.
CAPTAIN CHERNICK => The only mistake would be letting you walk out with whatever's in there. Barnes...
CAPTAIN CHERNICK => Throw him in there.
27                                                                    27 => Hudgens struggles to his feet. He BANGS on the door, trying to pull it open.
HUDGENS => Captain! Don't open it!
28                                                                    28 => The First Mate and Crewman Barnes watch in fasciation as Captain Chernick prepares to open the gold container. APTAIN CHERNICK Let's see what all the fuss is about...

36                                                                     36 => As the First Mate and Crewman Barnes watch in anticipation, Captain Chernick opens the gold container all the way.

AGENT MILES => Well, sir, normal levels of paranormal activity range from three to five...
BURKE => condescending) Yes Miles. And what level are the sensors picking up now?

FISCHER => Why did I agree to this?
CARNBY => I ordered for you, Fischer. It's pecan.
FISCHER => You've got a good memory, Carnby.
FISCHER => I tracked down the three you asked about. They all disappeared last night. Same story. No suitcase. No car. Just up and walked out in the middle of the night.
CARNBY => That means all nineteen are missing.
FISCHER => I ran full cross-references. Nothing much in common between them. Except they all grew up in the same orphanage. Your orphanage. What's going on, Carnby?
CARNBY => That's what I'm trying to find out.
CARNBY => Thanks Fischer. It's good to know I've still got friends at 713.

ALINE => Hello?
HUDGENS => Did a shipment arrive for me today?
ALINE => It's a fascinating piece, Dr. Hudgens. I started decoding the pictograms and...
HUDGENS =>  Who told you to do that? That crate was not to be opened.
ALINE => I was only going to catalogue it for you.
HUDGENS => It's not your place to question my instructions, Ms. Cedrac. Leave the tablet alone. I'll catalogue it myself when I get back.
ALINE => But, Dr. Hudgens, I was just...
GUARD => There's... somebody here to see you.
62                                                                     62 => Aline exits quickly out of a service door, looking anxious. The Guard scurries after her.

ALINE => And how did you end up with it?
CARNBY => I asked very nicely.
ALINE => You should've called, Edward. Or written. Just to let me know you were alive.
CARNBY => Does it make any sense to you?
ALINE => Yesterday, maybe not. But something happened last night.
ALINE => They were found in completely different locations. Alaska. Newfoundland. Venezuela. And now this one's from Chile.
CARNBY => Ten thousand years ago, it would've been like burying them at the ends of the earth.
ALINE => The Abkani's written language is based on pictograms. Combinations of symbols to create different meanings. But there's one here I've never seen before.
CARNBY => You're not trying to seduce me, are you?
ALINE => Give me that.
65                                                                      65 => The lights flicker. Large shadows are cast through the area by the remaining, dim lights.
UARD => I don't care if nothing's wrong with the grid. Something's definitely wrong with our power. Get someone down here, pronto.
65A                                                                    65A => Carnby and Aline walk down the Hallway. Framed art hangs from the walls. Small sculptures sit on pedestals along the way.
ALINE => What is it?
CARNBY => Hairs on the back of my neck just stood up.
ALINE => How come every time you show up, my life gets complicated?
CARNBY => I could ask you the same thing.
65C                                                                    65C => Aline leads the way with the flashlight, followed by Carnby. The Hallway is only faintly lit.
69                                                                     69 => Aline and Carnby quietly come out a service door that leads to the Ceramics Room. They conceal themselves behind a pair of columns, scanning the area before they step out.
CARNBY => I think we'd better run...
69A                                                                    69A => Aline and Carnby run down the long Hallway, towards a pair of double-doors at the other end.
69B                                                                    69B => Carnby leans up against the door, pushing it closed. Aline fumbles for her building keys.
CARNBY => Can't hold it...
CARNBY => Is there any way out of here?
ALINE => No! Why didn't you ask me that before you pushed me in here?
ALINE => What do you think?
ALINE => Those doors lead to the front entrance.
83                                                                      83 => Aline and Carnby quietly open the double-doors leading into the Main Hall.
85                                                                   85 => In a hail of shattered glass, AGENTS BARR , CHEUNG burst through the skylight, rappelling down on zip-lines from the hovering helicopter.
AGENT BARR => Reading two xenos.
KRASH => Confirmed.
AGENT CHEUNG => There!
KRASH => Losing readings.
AGENT BARR => Cheung! Marko! Don't let them get away!
5A                                                                      85A => Krash reads the data streaming by on her banks of monitors. She speaks into her omnipresent headset.
KRASH => Readings gone. You lost them, Barr.
85B                                                                      85B => Agent Barr holds his rifle trained at Carnby and Aline.
AGENT BARR => Goddamn it, Krash, I know. Commander Burke, we're secure. And sir... Carnby is here.
86                                                                   86 => The lights around the Museum have come back on.
BURKE => I want a full security sweep. Miles, get Fischer to send his sci-and-spy boys down here. Now go.
87                                                                   87 => The silhouettes of the five Agents, Burke, and Miles come through the spotlight beams as they enter the Museum.
BURKE => hat the hell are you doing here, Carnby?
CARNBY => Hey Richie.
BURKE => It's Commander Burke. This is my unit.
ALINE => They saved our lives.
BURKE => You used to be able to take care of yourself, Carnby. Gotten soft since you left 713?
AGENT MILES => Ms. Cedrac, I'm Agent Miles. This is Commander Burke.
BURKE => Aline Cedrac. Pleasure to meet you. How's the Ph.D. coming along?
ALINE => It's fine. Thanks.
BURKE => Miles, get her to a medic.
CARNBY => I'll catch up.
BURKE => Why am I still looking at you?
CARNBY => I need to know what those things are.
BURKE => That information's classified. If you were still an agent, you'd already know. But since you're not, stay out of my way.
CARNBY => I'm asking nicely.
BURKE => Get him out of here!
CARNBY => You're right, Commander. I guess I have gone soft.
91                                                                      91 => The front of the Museum has been completely blocked off. There is lots of activity, as BUREAU AGENTS mill around.
ALINE => I want to finish studying those artifacts.
CARNBY => I need to find out what's happened to John and the others. Stay in contact. We'll meet up later.
91A                                                                    91A => Burke oversees a team of AGENTS in biohazard suits as they sweep the scene, running scans of the area on high-tech hand- held devices. Photos are snapped by another AGENT.
ALINE => Commander, I need to get to my office.
BURKE => The museum's quarantined until we're done.
ALINE => At least let me pack up my work. There's priceless artifacts in there. If they get damaged...
BURKE => If you notice anything out of the ordinary, let me know immediately.
ALINE => I don't think I want to know your definition of out of the ordinary.
103                                                                    103 => The Lab is full of sleek, high-tech lab equipment and state of the art computers. The room is lit with a HUMMING fluorescent light. Surgical equipment and various pieces of high-tech machinery BUZZ by an autopsy slab. Surgical tools are laid out on a table.
FISCHER => You shouldn't be here, Carnby.
CARNBY => I'm not here. Commander Burke is. Now what the hell is that thing inside him?
FISCHER => Your curiosity have anything to do with the fingerprint of yours I found on his corpse?
CARNBY => The list of people I trust is short, Fischer. Is it about to get shorter?
CARNBY => Have you I-D'd him?
FISCHER => Yeah, we got dentals. Agent James Pinkerton. He's ex-713.
CARNBY => He was an agent? When?
FISCHER => Went MIA twenty years ago. Presumed dead. I'm trying to get more intell, but his records are so classified, they're practically invisible. arnby takes the tongs from Fischer, holding open the skin. Fischer makes a series of incisions with the scalpel, disconnecting the spinal-worm from Pinkerton's spine.
CARNBY => It's fused with his nervous system.
FISCHER => I've never seen this kind of symbiosis before.
FISCHER => Scanner's still reading something...
HUDGENS => The Abkani never cease to amaze me.
HUDGENS => Such a complex society at a time when most of humanity was still hunting and gathering and huddling around fires.
ALINE => Dr. Hudgens. When did you get back?
HUDGENS => A few hours ago. I heard there was some excitement. Are you alright?
ALINE => I'm fine. A bit shaken up. But fine.
HUDGENS => I apologize for snapping at you earlier. Now, what are you still doing here after all you've been through?
HUDGENS => Where did you get that image?
ALINE => Edward.
HUDGENS => This is a major find. I'll need to analyze it. Confirm its authenticity.
ALINE => I can do that myself.
HUDGENS => That wasn't a request...
HUDGENS => Where is the artifact?
AGENT CHEUNG => Everything okay in here?
HUDGENS => And you are?
AGENT CHEUNG => Ms. Cedrac's security detail.
HUDGENS => My dear, do you have any idea who I...
AGENT CHEUNG =>  Dr. Lionel Hudgens. Former agent, sci-and- spy division. Currently 713 advisor status. I know exactly who you are. But I'm not your "dear" anything.
HUDGENS => I'll just have to hold off my curiosity until morning.
ALINE => Dr. Hudgens... I forgot to ask. Did you find the Erebus this time?
HUDGENS => Just an empty shipwreck. You were right. It was another wild goosechase.
ALINE => Since when do I have a security detail?
AGENT CHEUNG => Since it seemed like you needed it.
104                                                                 104 => Carnby lies on a bed with his shirt off. Fischer runs the hand-held scanner over Carnby's torso. He looks at the results of Carnby's scan on a monitor.
FISCHER => There's one inside you too. But the symbiosis is incomplete.
CARNBY => Can you remove it?
FISCHER => I could try. But it might paralyze you.
ALINE => What's missing...
107                                                                    107 => Fischer and Carnby stand in front of an open armory cabinet. Sleek 713 assault rifles are lined up on a rack beside them.
CARNBY => I'm not much for coincidences. These organisms must be connected to those things from the museum.
FISCHER => We call them xenomorphs.
CARNBY => Catchy. When did they first appear?
FISCHER => Two years ago. They've been 713's top priority ever since. But it's been almost exclusively in rural areas. This kind of urban infiltration is unprecedented.
CARNBY => Have you isolated any weaknesses?
FISCHER => Most metals pass right through them. So normal bullets and blades are useless. But they're vulnerable to elements 76 to 79. Osmium, iridium, platinum, and gold. Negates their ability to disrupt electricity.
CARNBY => If they disrupt electricity, why did my flashlight still work?
FISCHER => The closer the current to its power source, the less disruption.
FISCHER => This is calibrated to track their disruption field. It won't help you see them, but you'll know when they're nearby.
FISCHER => They live almost exclusively in darkness. Sunlight's lethal in large doses. But only certain light frequencies hurt them.
ISCHER => These lamps are set to an effective frequency.
FISCHER => But for maximum damage, we use bullets coated in a photon-accelerated luminescent resin. Cuts right through them.
CARNBY => I'm going to need a lot of those.
115                                                                    115 => Carnby unlocks the multiple locks on the front door to his Loft and enters. He carries a heavy duffle-bag. He looks exhausted.
CARNBY => Five minutes...
116                                                                        116 => Fischer sits at his computer. He is going through the Bureau 713 database. He pulls up Pinkerton's file. A red CLASSIFIED sign flashes onscreen.
AGENT MILES => Fischer...
AGENT MILES => Commander Burke wants to see you.
117                                                                    117 => Aline walks up to an imposing, slightly decrepit-looking old brick building in a bad area of town.
119                                                                    119 => Aline enters the Loft. She looks around.
LINE => Edward?
ALINE => I see nothing's changed...
ALINE => Edward?
ALINE => Sweet dreams...
BURKE => Have you been meeting with Carnby?
FISCHER => Yes. He's got intell we need. And I trust him.
URKE => We've got to trust each other, Fischer. Are you with us or not?
ISCHER => What do you need from me?
BURKE => All the intell you've got on Edward Carnby.
FISCHER => What else could I do? I had to tell him.
SARAH FISCHER => You did the right thing, Paul. From what you've told me, Carnby can take care of himself.
SARAH FISCHER => I'll get it. You stir.
FISCHER => Sarah? Answer me! Sarah!
HUDGENS => If you can't beat us, Fischer, join us.
124                                                                    124 => It's night. The Loft is dark. Carnby and Aline are fast asleep on the bed, lying next to one another.
ALINE => Something smells amazing.
ALINE => I love omelettes.
CARNBY => I know.
ALINE => I figured out a connection with the symbols on those artifacts. They correspond to constellations. But something's missing.
CARNBY => Maybe this will help...
ALINE => Can you run the program on this?
CARNBY => What are we looking for?
ALINE => The Abkani used constellations to pin- point a geographical location. But I don't think I can isolate it closer than a hundred mile radius.
LINE => Edward...
CARNBY => Yeah. That's us right there.
127                                                                     127 => Carnby puts the dishes from their meal into the Kitchen sink. The sink tap is RUNNING. Aline clears the dishes.
CARNBY => John?
CARNBY => Behind you!
ALINE => That looked like John.
CARNBY => It is. The other two are from the orphanage as well.
ALINE => You had no choice.
CARNBY => Something's controlling them.
ALINE => How many are there altogether?
CARNBY => Twenty. Including me.
CARNBY => We'd better get out of here.
GENT BARR => Carnby located.
KRASH => Multiple readings confirmed. Back-up's on the way.
AGENT BARR => Roger that. We're hot.
CARNBY => Aline!
AGENT BARR => Where the hell's our back-up?
KRASH => Landing.
AGENT BARR => We're clear, sir.
BURKE => Love what you've done with the place, Carnby.
AGENT MILES => Sir, this one's infected too!
AGENT TURNER => Got another one here!
BURKE => Drop your weapon and get down on the ground.
ALINE => What are you doing?
BURKE => He's been infected with some kind of organism. He could be under its control.
CARNBY => It's true. I've got one inside me. But it's not controlling me.
BURKE => You'll excuse me if I don't take your word for it. Now drop your weapon.
AGENT TURNER => Get out of the way!
ALINE => He's not one of them.
URKE => If I've got to shoot through you to get to him, I'll do it.
CARNBY => Why are the lights still out?
AGENT BARR => Scanner's clear.
AGENT MILES => Krash?
KRASH => Negative.
67A. => CONTINUED:
BURKE => Forget to pay your power bill, Carnby?
CARNBY => All Agents! You've got to kill the organism to stop them! Aim for the spine!
BURKE => Confirmed. Spinal shot's a kill shot.
BURKE => You remember the number one rule they teach you in 713 training? Trust your instincts.
BURKE => Fischer's missing. So is Hudgens. And I've got a situation brewing that makes this scrap look like a bar brawl.
ALINE => What does Hudgens have to do with this?
BURKE => That's what I want to find out. I need you both to brief me in the air.
BURKE => Oh, and Carnby... I'll need my I-D back.
134                                                                 134 => A massive, long-abandoned structure built directly against the face of a mountain. This is the Entrance Hall of Britannia Mine.
BURKE => Krash! What are you reading?
KRASH => We're practically off the scale, Commander. This is unprecedented. Should I initiate Contingency Nine-Alpha?
BURKE => The military? We don't have time to wait for them to mobilize.
KRASH => Is that a negative, Commander?
BURKE => No. Initiate Nine-Alpha on my authority. But I won't hold my breath. By the time this clears Defense Council, we'll be dead or drinking...
135                                                                       135 => Rusty construction vehicles, detritus, and rubble lie discarded throughout the Hall. Several shafts have been dug into the mountain. Narrow paths lead up the slope.
AGENT MILES => We've got three perimeters of flash- mines. Gatling guns are set to electromagnetic motion tracking. And every available agent in the vicinity is here. But Commander...
BURKE => I know, Miles. But back-up won't make it before sunrise.
AGENT TURNER => Generator will be on-line shortly, sir.
ALINE => It looks like you're going to war.
BURKE => We are. The highest xeno concentration on record is closing in on this location. This could be our chance to wipe them out once and for all.
CARNBY => We need to go down there.
BURKE => What?
CARNBY => They're coming here for a reason. Until we know what they're after, we're never really going to be able to stop them.
AGENT MILES => Something's definitely down there, sir. But there's too much interference to get a clear reading from here.
BURKE => Goddamn it. Miles, you're in charge of perimeter defense. Nothing gets in or out until we find out what's down there.
ALINE => I've been thinking about something. The Abkani prophecy. The shadows that make ghosts of men...
CARNBY => Every culture has a story about the end of the world.
ALINE => But not every story starts to come true.
AGENT BARR => It's definitely this way, sir.
144                                                                    144 => The Tunnel ends at a slightly larger, rounded Chamber with walls of solid rock. They can't go any further. Cobwebs and thick dust hang everywhere.
BURKE => It's a dead end.
AGENT BARR => Readings are getting stronger.
BURKE => We'll double-back. Take another tunnel.
CARNBY => Wait. Aline, look at this...
ALINE => They're Abkani.
AGENT CHEUNG => There's more over here.
AGENT BARR => What do you got, Marko?
AGENT BARR => Marko!
145                                                                     145 => The Shaft drops into a round, sand-covered room. Razor-sharp spikes poke out of the loose sand beneath the Shaft.
them. => 46                                                                     146 The others rush to the lip of the Shaft. They can barely see the illumination of Marko's flashlight in the depths below.
BURKE => We've got to get down there.
AGENT MILES => Defense perimeter's up. Still waiting for the generator to come on-line.
URKE => We're retrieving Marko. Keep me posted.
AGENT FEENSTRA => How long do we have to hold them?
AGENT MILES => Only until dawn.
AGENT FEENSTRA => Sir... that's four hours away.
AGENT MILES => I know.
O                                                              146B => n the side of a mountain rising up over Britannia Mine, Hudgens and Fischer stand watching the activity below.
147                                                                       147 => Dozens of Agents in full combat gear are in position. They are armed, tense, and ready.
AGENT MILES => Incoming!
148                                                                       148 => Agent Miles runs up to Agent Turner. He is still tinkering with the generator. The spotlights are still off.
AGENT MILES => Where the hell are the lights?
AGENT TURNER => The generator's not coming on-line. They must be disrupting it.
149                                                                       149 => Burke, and Agents Barr and Cheung lower themselves down the Shaft on zip-lines. They descend quickly and smoothly.
AGENT MILES => We've got incoming! What are your orders?
BURKE => Hold tight, Miles. Once we retrieve Marko we're coming back up. Whatever's down here is going to have to wait.
152                                                                     152 => In the distance, a bright flash goes off. Then another. And another. The flashes light up the landscape. The inhuman SQUEALS of the creatures can be heard in the distance.
AGENT MILES => They've hit the outer perimeter.
KRASH => Electromagnetics around the mine are off the scale.
AGENT MILES => Krash? Report! Krash?
53                                                                       153 => The friction from the Shaft walls is the only thing slowing the stone column's relentless descent down the Shaft.
CARNBY => Aline!
BURKE => Cheung! Cut the line!
154                                                                    154 => As Agent Cheung lands, she breaks her ankle from the impact. She SCREAMS in pain.
ALINE => It's a warning.
CARNBY => Subtle.
ALINE => The gist of it is, even if you make it down here alive, you're already dead.
BURKE => Krash, I need another exit. Can you run a sonar pulse at this depth?
BURKE => Krash? Are you reading me? Miles?
AGENT MILES => Can't get through to Krash either. Too much interference.
URKE => Use the second perimeter as your firing mark. I'll be there as soon as I find a way out.
AGENT MILES => Hold your fire until they're at the second perimeter.
AGENT MILES => Fire!
155                                                                 155 => The THUNDERING GUNFIRE of the rotating gatling guns fills the air. Thousands of glowing bullets streak through the night.
HELICOPTER PILOT => Ammo running low! How many of these goddamn things are there?
156                                                                    156 => Cheung tests her injured ankle. She can walk with a limp.
CARNBY => Aline!
BURKE => We've got to get up there.
GENT TURNER => Hit it.
158                                                                      158 => The creatures HISS and recoil from the spotlight beams. Some begin smoldering under the glare.
AGENT MILES => They're turning back! here's a moment of quiet. The Agents slump back, relieved. The creatures are all gone.
HELICOPTER PILOT => We've got to refuel and reload. We'll be back ASAP.
AGENT MILES => Confirmed.
AGENT FEENSTRA => We made it, sir.
AGENT TURNER => Fischer?
160                                                                    160 => arr and Carnby lay Cheung and Marko's bodies to one side of the Chamber, their faces covered with their vests.
BURKE => Miles! Re-route those `copters! Pull all agents back into the mine! Set formation in teams of three! Miles!
BURKE => Goddamn it!
CARNBY => We'll find a way out.
CARNBY => It's just like the organism Fischer took out of Pinkerton.
ALINE => Maybe this is what they look like when they grow outside a human host?
BURKE => I think you'd better see this.
AGENT MILES => Feenstra!
162                                                                   162 => Aline, Carnby, Burke, and Barr stand in front of the dark recess in the Sand Chamber. The recess is completely sealed up by a solid concrete wall. line comes up to the concrete wall, running her hands along its flat surface. It is obviously not Abkani.
ALINE => The Abkani didn't put this here.
GENT BARR => There's no way through.
BURKE => There's always a way...
AGENT FEENSTRA => I'm out.
AGENT MILES => Last one.
AGENT MILES => Commander? Krash? Anyone?
AGENT FEENSTRA => I can't walk. If I lay down suppressing fire, maybe you can make it out of here.
AGENT MILES => I die fighting or I don't die at all.
164                                                                      164 => Carnby, Aline, Barr, and Burke take cover behind the stone column. Burke holds a remote detonator. It is active.
ALINE => You sure this is going to work?
170                                                                      170 => Carnby, Aline, Barr, and Burke step over the rubble of the concrete wall. They shine their lights around the dark room.
ALINE => What is this place?
CARNBY => This is where it happened.
AGENT BARR => Commander...
ALINE => Edward, look...
CARNBY => So it's a key.
other side. => ALINE The pictograms carved here make it pretty clear that's a bad idea.
BURKE => Two, we set enough C-4 to bury this place. Keep whatever's in there, down here for good.
CARNBY => The answers I've been looking for my whole life could be in there.
ALINE => Some doors are locked for a reason.
CARNBY => Barr... how much C-4 you got left?
AGENT BARR => Enough to blow this place to...
HUDGENS => I'm afraid I can't allow that.
HUDGENS => Now drop your weapons and back away.
HUDGENS => Our early work was crude, I admit. But eventually we perfected the implant process. You were our last failure, Carnby. If you hadn't escaped, 713 never would've shut down the experiments. Burke's eyes flash with anger.
BURKE => There's no way this was sanctioned. HUDGENS Before your kind took over, 713 had very different... priorities. Now, you just blaze in and destroy everything before we can learn to control it. I've wasted twenty years working in secret because of short-sighted men like you. Hudgens sees the Abkani device Aline is holding.
HUDGENS => There it is... Aline's expression is firm, unafraid. She grips the device tightly. Hudgens is about to pull the trigger.
HUDGENS => You were a fine archeologist.
CARNBY => Aline...
CARNBY => Give him the key. Enough people have died today.
HUDGENS => You couldn't have opened it anyway. Not without this...
HUDGENS => Insert the key. line inserts the device into the opening in the door.
HUDGENS => Now turn it.
HUDGENS => When we found the first of them, 713 saw just another threat to be eliminated. But I knew it was something more. It was the first. The first to wake. I've woken others since then. But the rest are coming...
LINE => These doors won't hold them for long
BURKE => Once we get out, we can remote detonate.
CARNBY => Look at the dust on the floor. This is where Hudgens got in.
CARNBY => Over there!
176                                                                    176 => Aline climbs up the rungs of the ladder built into the Shaft wall. Carnby climbs up after her. urke stands at the bottom of the Shaft, looking up at them. Carnby stops climbing and looks down at Burke.
BURKE => The remote detonator's inactive. The signal can't get through.
CARNBY => We'll find a way.
URKE => You saved my life, Carnby. I don't much like debts.
CARNBY => Burke!
ALINE => Edward... if he detonates those charges, we're all dead.
181                                                                  181 => A small Storm Cellar is built into a corner of the Orphanage's front lawn. The corrugated metal doors are locked from the outside with a chain and rusty padlock.
CARNBY => They were under us the whole time.
ALINE => Where are all the children?
CARNBY => Something's very wrong...
184                                                                      184 => Carnby and Aline walk along a deserted street. The sun rises above them. It's a beautiful day.
ALINE => Edward... what's going on?
CARNBY => Remember what Hudgens said? I was his last failure. He said he perfected the implant process.
ALINE => It can't be...
CARNBY => Then where the hell is everybody? Where's everybody gone?
CARNBY => Here's what I know. There are two worlds on this planet. A world of light and a world of darkness. For millions of years, these worlds were in balance. But now, the lights of human civilization burn everywhere. The dark places are disappearing. We forced them to come out of the shadows. Now, it's my job to force them back in. My name is Edward Carnby. I'm here to protect you from things you don't believe in.
CARNBY => Aline...
ALINE => Yes Edward?
CARNBY => It's going to be a busy day.
