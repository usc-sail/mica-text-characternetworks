Roger => WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, OFFICER?
96     Roger => WHAT DO YOU MEAN FRIENDS?
97     Steve => THEY KNOW, ROG... THEY'RE TRYIN' TO GET OUT, TOO.
Officer 3 => IT'D BE CRAZY TO START SHOOTIN' AT ONE ANOTHER, NOW WOULDN'T IT?
98     Roger => SURE WOULD.
Officer 1 => YOU BETTER LEARN HOW TO USE THAT THING, WOMAN. TIMES IS TENSE.
Roger => YOU OK?

Fran => AN EX-HUSBAND.
Roger => AN EX-WIFE.
Steve => YOU PETER?
Peter =>  SOME BROTHERS.
Fran => REAL BROTHERS?
Fran => REAL BROTHERS OR...STREET BROTHERS?
Peter => BOTH.
Fran => HOW MANY REAL ONES?
Peter => TWO.
Fran => TWO.
Peter => ONE'S IN JAIL. THE OTHER'S A PRO BALL PLAYER. BUT WE CATCH UP TO EACH OTHER ONCE IN A WHILE.
Peter =>  HE YOUR MAN NOW?
Fran => MOST OF THE TIME, YEAH.
Peter => JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHO EVERYONE IS.
Fran => YEAH. ME TOO.
Steve => ANY MORE WATER?
Peter =>  YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?
Steve => I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE.
Peter => HARRISBURG?
Steve => PASSED IT ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
Steve => WE'RE PRETTY LOW ON FUEL. I'M JUST WAITIN' FOR FULL LIGHT SO WE CAN SEE WHAT WE'RE LANDIN' IN.
116    Roger => JESUS. IT'S EVERYWHERE.
Steve => WE'RE STILL PRETTY CLOSE TO JOHNSTOWN. WE'RE BETTER OFF AWAY FROM THE BIG CITIES.
Steve => SHIT, MAN, DAMN NEAR EMPTY.
Roger => LOTTA PRIVATE PLANES IN FARM COUNTRY LIKE THIS. GUESS THEY ALL HIT THE PUMPS AND TOOK OFF.
Steve => TO WHERE? WHERE THE HELL CAN THEY GO?
Peter => WHERE WE GOIN?
Steve => THERE'S A GOOD BIT LEFT IN THIS PUMP.
Steve => DAMN. I GOTTA GET IT CLOSER.
Steve => I'M GONNA SEE WHAT'S LEFT IN THE HANGARS.
Steve => ROGER...ROGER...
Steve => JUST RUN.
Steve => RUN RIGHT PAST 'EM...RIGHT AROUND 'EM. THEY CAN'T CATCH YOU.
Steve => RUN, FRANNIE. GODDAMMIT, I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU. WE CAN HANDLE THEM!
Steve => RUN, FRANNIE. MOVE!
Roger => PETER.
Fran => NO...MY GOD...DON'T... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Peter => YOU NEVER AIM A GUN AT ANYONE, MISTER. IT'S SCARY. ISN'T IT? ISN'T IT?
Steve => WE GOTTA FIND FUEL. MAYBE CLOSER TO PITTSBURGH.
Roger => NO, WE'VE GOTTA STAY OUT OF THE BIG CITIES. IT IT'S ANYTHING LIKE PHILLY WE MIGHT NEVER GET OUT ALIVE.
Peter => WE MIGHT NOT GET OUT OF ANY PLACE ALIVE. WE ALMOST DIDN'T GET OUT OF HERE.
Roger => WE'RE GETTIN' OUTA HERE FINE. AS LONG AS THERE'S NOT TOO MANY OF THOSE THINGS WE CAN HANDLE 'EM EASY.
Peter => YEAH, WELL IT WASN'T "THOSE THINGS" THAT NEARLY BLEW ME AWAY!
Roger => WE GOTTA STAY IN THE STICKS. THERE'S BOUND TO BE MORE LITTLE PRIVATE AIRPORTS UPSTATE.
Steve =>  THERE'S THE LOCKS ALONG THE ALLGHENY. FUEL STATIONS THERE, PRIVATE AND STATE.
Roger => PROB'LY STILL MANNED. WE DON'T NEED THOSE HASSLES EITHER.
Steve => THEY'RE JUST OUT AFTER SCAVENGERS...LOOTERS...
Peter => OH, YOU GOT THE PAPERS FOR THIS LIMOUSINE?
Steve =>  I GOT J.A.S. ID. SO DOES FRAN.
Fran => JESUS CHRIST. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING.  WE DON'T HAVE A RADIO.  WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF WATER. WE NEED FOOD....STEPHEN, YOU NEED TO SLEEP.
Fran => OH MY GOD!
Stephen => NO CHANCE. FORGET IT, LET'S GET OUTTA HERE. Roger WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE...THEY CAN'T            GET UP HERE. Steve YEAH, AND WE CAN'T GO DOWN THERE!
Roger => LET'S CHECK IT OUT. Roger trots away. 163    Peter has moved directly to an area where a giant grid of transparent Plexiglas bubbles face down into the building. He stares through one of them and can see into the mall below. Roger trots up and peers through another of the bubbles. Peter MOST OF THE GATES ARE DOWN. I DON'T THINK            THEY CAN GET INTO THE STORES.164    The vantage point only reveals a small aspect of the interior, a square plaza with a garden beneath the sunroof of transparent bubbles. The space is open all the way down to the garden, which is two storeys below. Around the garden on the bottom floor can be seen the entrances to several shops. All but one have heavy metal cage gates down and locked into position. One or two Zombies are seen wandering about. They cannot enter the stores, except for the one which is un-gated.
Roger => I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM UP ON THE SECOND FLOOR.
Peter => THE BIG DEPARTMENT STORES USUALLY USE BOTH FLOORS.
Roger => IF WE CAN GET IN UP TOP...
167    Fran =>  WHAT ARE THEY DOING? WHY DO THEY COME HERE?
Steve =>  SOME KIND OF INSTINCT. MEMORY...OF WHAT THEY USED TO DO. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN THEIR LIVES.
170    Peter => SOLAR SCREENS.
Roger => CAN'T BE ENOUGH TO POWER THIS PLACE.
Peter => EMERGENCY SYSTEM, MAYBE.
Roger => IT'S PRETTY LIT UP IN THERE.
Peter => GUESS THE POWER'S NOT OFF IN THIS AREA. A LOT OF PHILLY'S STILL LIT. COULD BE NUCLEAR.
171    Roger => HEY LOOK AT THIS!
Roger => THESE DON'T GO DOWN INTO THE MALL. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
Peter => DAMN.
Roger => HEY, OVER HERE. THERE'S SOMETHIN' HERE.
Roger => STORAGE?
176    Peter => CIVIL DEFENCE. CIVIL DEFENCE WATER SUPPLY.
Roger => AND BOXES OF CANNED FOOD!
Steve => HOW DO WE GET DOWN THERE?
Peter => OK.
Roger => DOUBLE DAMN! LOOKS LIKE A FREE LUNCH, BUDDY.183    In the first room Stephen has started to rip open one of the cartons.
Fran => SPAM!
Roger => YOU BRING A CAN OPENER?
Fran => OH.
Roger => THEN DON'T KNOCK SPAM. IT'S GOT IT'S OWN KEY.
Roger => WHATD'YA THINK?
Roger => THIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP HERE. WHATD'YA THINK? CUT.
Roger => YOU BETTER GET SOME SLEEP, TOO, BUDDY.
Peter => THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF STUFF DOWN THERE THAT WE COULD USE, BROTHER.
Roger => I KNOW IT.
mall.    Peter => THEY'RE PRETTY SPREAD OUT DOWN THERE. IT'S A BIG PLACE. I THINK WE WOULD OUT-RUN 'EM.
Roger => HIT AND RUN.
Peter => HIT AND RUN... MAYBE GRAB US OFF A RADIO...
Fran => YOU'RE CRAZY!    Roger THIS PLACE COULD BE A GOLD MINE. WE GOTTA AT LEAST CHECK IT OUT.
189    Fran => THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM...LOOK WHAT HAPPENED AT THE AIRPORT...
Peter => THE ONLY PROBLEM AT THE AIRPORT WAS STRAY BULLETS! WE COULD OUTFIGHT THOSE DUMMIES BLINDFOLDED.
Fran => STEPHEN...(the exhausted Pilot is sleeping through it all)
Peter =>  LEAVE HIM BE. WE'RE GOIN' OURSELVES.
Peter => ANYONE BUT US COMES UP THEM STAIRS, YOU GUYS TAKE OFF IN THE MACHINE. WE'LL TRY TO MAKE IT OUT TO THE PARKIN' LOT. YOU CAN PICK US UP THERE.
Peter => IF WE DON'T SHOW UP AFTER A FEW MINUTES... WE'LL CATCH UP TO YOU SOME OTHER TIME.            YOU UNDERSTAND?190    In the dimly lit firestair, the door on the top landing pulls open suddenly. The stairway is still empty.    The Troopers move slowly out onto the landing. They look down into the darkness below. Then they move slowly and silently down the steps. Fran appears on the upper landing. She stands in the doorway clutching the rifle.    Peter stops for a moment, looking back up at the frightened woman.    Peter YOU'LL PROB'LY HEAR SOME SHOOTING.            JUST DON'T PANIC, OK.
Peter => YOU'LL BE ALRIGHT. IT'S OUR ASSES THAT'S IN THE FIRE.
wide open. => 195    Roger ducks quickly into the room with his rifle raised. It is a large administrative office, with rows of desks which are fully equipped for a staff of secretaries and accountants.196    The next room has a closed door, but it is unlocked. Peter    swings the door open and silently jumps into the room. This is a much more spartan area, with two metal desks and a few chairs. There are several phones. It is a maintenance office. On one wall is a large map of the mall, with pin flags and scribbling over an acetate which covers the drawing. At the other end of the space is a huge electrical panel with circuit breakers and an entire series of master controls all keyed by a number code to another map of the mall showing electrical installations.    On the wall behind Peter is a large blackboard and two metal cabinets. One is open. It contains all sorts of tools, manual and electric. There are circuit testers, walkie talkie units and there are several enormous rings containing hundreds of keys, also colour and number coded. Peter grabs up one of the rings and Roger steps up behind him.    Roger THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM.197    Back in the hallway, Roger's hand tries another doorknob and    throws the door open. This opens onto beautifully plush offices, obviously the executive headquarters.    The rooms interconnect, and while Peter walks from door to door in the corridor, Roger moves through the inner doors, meeting Peter at each room. One office is more elegant than the next, with the latest in designer furniture and expensive decorations.198    The Troopers finally reach a room on which both the interior and corridor doors are closed and locked. The brass nameplate on the interior door reads C.J. Porter - President.199    Roger moves out to the corridor where he joins Peter. They move into the exterior corridor. They are very near the end of the hall, and the brightly lit shopping area is close at hand. They can only see a small section.200    The balcony on their side is railed off against the open drop down to the first floor, and across the great cavity they see the opposite balcony. On the far side only two store fronts can be seen. They are both gated and shut. 201    The two realise what dangers might face them in the mall proper. They look at each other and move forward, each clinging to opposite walls in the corridor.202    As they reach the mall proper they slowly and carefully peer around their respective corners.
206    Roger => IT'S CHRISTMASTIME DOWN THERE, BUDDY. Peter FAT CITY, BROTHER. HOW WE GONNA WORK IT.    Roger WE GET INTO THE DEPARTMENT STORES UP HERE.            THEY PROB'LY HAVE THEIR OWN ESCALATORS INSIDE.
Peter => LET'S CHECK THOSE KEYS.
Roger => SEVENTY TWO...U. AND D. ...HERE IT IS...
Peter => HERE. Roger LET'S JUST HOPE IT'S RIGHT.    Peter LOOK HERE  THESE NUMBERS MUST ALL BE LOCKS  FRONT...SIDE...BACK OUTSIDE, MUST BE LIKE LOADING DOCKS...BUT WHAT ARE THESE?
Roger => HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MUSIC? Peter WHAT?210    The big Black moves up behind his partner. One of the controls on the panel is marked MUSIC TAPE. It indicates a master switch which is in the off position. Another is marked FLOOR EXHIBITS and a series of others are marked ESCALATORS. There are dozens of master switches which are in the off mode. Peter POWER SWITCHES. Roger THE MUSIC MIGHT COVER THE NOISE WE MAKE.    Peter HIT 'EM ALL. MIGHT AS WELL HAVE POWER IN            EVERYTHING. WE MIGHT NEED IT.
Fran => STEPHEN... STEPHEN!
Steve => JESUS CHRIST... THEY'RE MANIACS.
Peter => YOU GAME?    Roger nods and the two men run down the hall toward the mall.    Their rifles poised, they are like commandos on an important mission.
Steve => IT'S ALRIGHT.
locked.    Peter => YOU BASTARD! Roger WHAT?
Peter => STILL LOCKED... ON THE SIDE...
Fran => STEPHEN...FOR GOD'S SAKE...LET'S GET UP ON THE ROOF...243    Steve is at the middle landing. He stares down into the darkness below. More gunfire can be heard from the mall.
Steve => IT'S ALRIGHT, I'M TELLIN 'YA. THOSE THINGS            DON'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH TO CATCH US.    More gunfire can be heard.244    Now the giant gate rolls up with a loud rumble. Peter ducks into the store even as the gate is still rising, but the inertia of the great metal cage carries the lip up out of Peter's grasp. He jumps to try to catch it, but he misses. It jerks up into its fully open position and rolls back down slightly, but still Peter cannot reach the lip. It slides back to rest about three feet above Peter's fingertips.245    The Zombies advance.246    Roger drops another with a clean shot through the head, then he backs into the archway of the Department Store entrance. Peter is desperately looking around for something to stand on to reach the gate.247    The Zombies are very close to the arch now, advancing steadily.
Peter => HERE...COME ON...
Roger => LET UP A LITTLE...LET UP A LITTLE...
upward.    Peter => COME ON...COME ON...    Roger lets go his gun barrel and the weapon is snatched away by the creature in the crowd. Roger grabs for the gate.    Peter THE ARM...THAT ARM'S IN THE WAY.    Roger squats again and manages to throw the dead Zombie's arm    clear. Then he grabs the gate again. Now it starts to move down more steadily.    At the last moment, another clutching arm juts into the store, but when the gate hits it, it withdraws, and the big cage clicks solidly into place.
Roger => HEY MAN, WE CAN'T CARRY ALL THIS SHIT...
Roger => OH...WE'RE GONNA JUST WHEEL RIGHT BY 'EM, RIGHT?    Peter WE GONNA TRY, BROTHER. WE AIN'T DOIN' THIS FOR THE EXERCISE. WE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO GET WHAT WE CAN.
Roger => THERE'S NO WAY THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN...
Roger => HEY, UGLY!
Roger => OVER HERE...LET'S GO OVER HERE...
Peter => JUST GIVE IT TIME ...GIVE IT TIME.
Department Store. => 274    In the concourse, many creatures are moving toward the gate. Already there are a dozen or so clutching and pushing at the metal grid. Through the crowd. Peter can see several other creatures lumbering down the stationary steps.
275    Peter => OK...THEY 'RE COMIN'...
Roger => I THINK WE CAN MOVE THE WAGON.
Peter => CLEAR?
Roger =>  NOT ALTOGETHER, BUT THEY'RE SPREAD OUT PRETTY GOOD...ENOUGH TO MOVE THE WAGON.
Peter => WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
Roger => FUZZ MAYBE?
Peter => OR MAYBE FLYBOY. WHERE'S IT COMIN' FROM?
Roger => CAN'T TELL.
Peter => COME ON. OPEN UP.
Roger => MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIN'...
Peter => OPEN UP. I CAN GET THE WAGON OVER. IF IT IS FLYBOY, LET'S GET HIM ON OUR SIDE.
Peter =>  YOU JUST COVER ME GOOD, YOU HEAR?
Peter => RUN FOR IT.  RUN THIS WAY. The Zombies are drawing closer and closer.317    Peter COME ON, MAN. RUN THIS WAY. YOU CAN RUN RIGHT THROUGH 'EM. WE GOTTA LEAD 'EM AWAY FROM HERE!
319    Peter => COME ON, FLYBOY. YOU CAN MAKE IT. COME ON!
Peter => DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN ...SAME TRICK.
Steve => WHAT DO WE DO...
Roger => LET 'EM KNOW WE'RE HERE...  WHOOOO HOOOOOO...OVER HERE...YEEE HAAAAAAAA.    Steve starts to laugh at the ludicrous situation. Peter smiles at the young pilot.
Peter => YOU DID ALRIGHT THIS TIME FLYBOY. HOW 'BOUT IT?
Steve => WHOOOOOOOOOOOPEEEEEEEEE...
Roger => WE JUST GOTTA WAIT LONGER BEFORE WE MOVE.
Peter => NO. THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE OF SOME OF THEM STAYIN' UP ON THE BALCONY.
Roger => YEAH, BUT WE CAN HANDLE THAT.  WE CAN BREAK THROUGH.
Peter => IF ANY OF THEM SEE OR HEAR US, THEY'LL JUST FOLLOW US ON UP.  IT'S NO GOOD.
Roger => WE CAN SURE AS HELL OUT RUN 'EM...LOAD UP WHAT WE CAN AND GET OUTTA HERE.
Peter => I'M THINKIN' MAYBE WE GOT A GOOD THING GOIN' HERE. MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO LEAVE.    Roger OH, MAN...    Peter IF WE COULD GET BACK UP THERE WITHOUT THEM            CATCHIN' ON, WE COULD HOLE UP FOR A WHILE. AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH A BREATH. CHECK OUT THE RADIO. SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIN'...    Roger MAN, I DON'T KNOW...    Steve THERE'S SOME KIND OF PASSAGEWAY OVER THE TOP OF THE STORES.
Steve => I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S JUST HEATING DUCTS OR IF IT'S SOME KIND OF ACCESS. I SAW IT ON A MAP.
Peter => UPSTAIRS.  LET'S GO.
336    Peter => WATCH IT...DON'T LET 'EM SEE YOU.
Roger => DAMN. THAT'S THOSE OTHER LOCK NUMBERS WE SAW ON THE CHART.
Steve => WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY BE LOCKED?
Peter => JACKPOT, FLYBOY. YOU'RE RIGHT. Roger WHAT?    Peter THEY'RE LOCKED BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THROUGH            'EM EASY FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE BUILDING.    Steve OVER HERE.339    Steve notices that one of the ceiling grids is very close to the elevators. Peter looks at the grids, then down at the double doors.    Peter THE ELEVATOR SHAFT! He moves over and hits the button. The doors open. Peter HOLD 'EM.    Roger stands against the rubber safety bumper, holding the car doors open wide. Peter steps onto the hand railing and reaches up for the escape hatch, which is held in place by four knub- headed bolts. He removes the bolts quickly and dislodges the hatch cover and passes it down to Stephen.    Then the big man sticks his head up through the opening.340    He looks around the elevator shaft, shining his flash this way    and that. He sees another grid in the shaft wall.
Peter => IT'S HERE...AND IT AIN'T LOCKED. GET A SCREW- DRIVER AND SOMETHIN' TO STAND ON FOR IN HERE.
341    Roger => I KNOW WHERE THE TOOLS ARE. GET ONE OF THOSE TABLES.
bag.    Roger => ONE-STOP SHOPPING ...ANYTHING YOU NEED RIGHT            AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.344    Steve relays the tools up to Peter, who immediately begins to work on the screws which mount the grid. He passes the flashlight to Steve who holds the beam on the work area.345    Fran sits in the stairwell, her hand over her mouth. It is very quiet for a moment, then she hears a slight clicking. Her head snaps to attention. She stares down at the bottom landing. There is a thump at the door.    Slowly the woman stands to her feet, her eyes transfixed on the door below.    Fran STEPHEN!
SWEET JESUS! => Peter I SEEN IT. COME ON!    The men are in a large ductwork which seems to run along the entire length of the mall. They move as quietly as they can. There are several side tunnels branching off in both directions.
Roger => I HOPE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOIN', BUDDY.
Peter =>  THIS IS IT. COME ON.
Peter => COME ON...
Peter => JUST DROP, I GOT YOU...
Steve => I CAN'T...I...

Steve => WE'RE OK...WE'RE ALL OK...WE GOT A LOT OF STUFF...ALL KINDS OF STUFF...
Steve => THIS IS A TERRIFIC PLACE...FRANNIE. THIS PLACE IS PERFECT. WE GOT IT MADE IN HERE...FRANNIE.
Roger => WHAT THE HELL TIME IS IT, ANYWAY?
Steve => ONLY ABOUT NINE.
Roger => AND NOTHING?
Steve => AS LONG AS WE'RE GETTING THE PATTERN, THAT MEANS THEY'RE SENDING.
Radio => ...REPORTS THAT COMMUNICATIONS WITH DETROIT HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT ALONG WITH ATLANTA, BOSTON AND CERTAIN SECTIONS OF PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK CITY...
Roger => PHILLY...
Steve => I KNOW J.A.S IS OUT BY NOW...IT WAS A MADHOUSE BACK THERE...PEOPLE ARE CRAZY...IF THEY'D JUST ORGANISE...IT'S TOTAL CONFUSION...I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S GOTTEN THIS BAD. I DON'T BELIEVE THEY CAN'T HANDLE IT. LOOK AT US. LOOT AT WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO TODAY.
Steve => WE KNOCKED THE SHIT OUT OF 'EM AND THEY NEVER TOUCHED US...NOT REALLY.
Peter => THEY TOUCHED US GOOD, FLYBOY. WE'RE LUCKY TO GET OUT WITH OUR ASSES. YOU DON'T FORGET THAT!
Peter => YOU GET OVERCONFIDENT...UNDERESTIMATE THOSE SUCKERS...AND YOU GET EATEN! HOW YOU LIKE THAT?
Peter => THEY GOT A BIG ADVANTAGE OVER US BROTHER. THEY DON'T THINK. THEY JUST BLIND-ASS DO WHAT THEY GOT TO DO. NO EMOTIONS. AND THAT BUNCH OUT THERE? THAT'S JUST A HANDFUL AND EVERY DAY THERE'LL BE MORE. A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DIE EACH DAY FROM NATURAL CAUSES. THAT PROB'LY TRIPLES OR BETTER WITH FOLK KNOCKIN' EACH OTHER OFF THE WAY IT'S GOIN'. NOW SAY EACH ONE OF THEM COMES BACK AND KILLS TWO, AND EACH ONE OF THEM TWO MORE... YOU KNOW ABOUT THE EMPEROR'S REWARD?
Steve => HEY...YOU OK?
Fran => SO I GUESS WE FORGET ABOUT CANADA, RIGHT?
Steve =>  JESUS, FRANNIE, THIS SET UP IS SENSATIONAL. WE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED. WE SEAL OFF THAT STAIRWAY...NOBODY'LL EVER KNOW WE'RE UP HERE. WE'D NEVER FIND ANYTHING LIKE THIS...
Fran => I GUESS NOBODY CARES ABOUT MY VOTE, HUH?
Steve => COME ON, FRANNIE, YOU WERE SLEEPING.
Fran => WHAT HAPPENED TO GROWING VEGETABLES AND FISHING? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE IDEA ABOUT THE WILDERNESS... HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM ANYTHING AND ANYBODY... STEVE, I'M AFRAID. YOU'RE HYPNOTISED BY THIS PLACE. ALL OF YOU. IT'S ALL SO BRIGHT AND NEATLY WRAPPED THAT YOU DON'T SEE...YOU DON'T SEE THAT IT CAN BE A PRISON.
Fran => STEPHEN, LET'S JUST TAKE WHAT WE NEED AND KEEP GOING.
Steve => WE CAN'T HARDLY CARRY ANYTHING IN THAT LITTLE BIRD.
Fran =>  WHAY DO YOU WANT? A NEW SET OF FURNITURE? A FREEZER? A CONSOLE TV AND A STEREO? WE CAN TAKE WHAT WE NEED. WHAT WE NEED TO SURVIVE.
Peter => SHUT THAT THING OFF!
Peter => SOMEBODY BETTER SIT WATCH ALL THE TIME.
Roger => THEY'LL NEVER GET THROUGH THERE.
Peter => ENOUGH OF 'EM WILL. AND IT AIN'T JUST THEM THINGS WE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT. THAT CHOPPER UP THERE COULD GIVE US AWAY IF SOMEBODY COMES MESS' AROUND.
Roger => WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO? LAND ANOTHER PILOT TO FLY IT OUT. THEY'RE NOT GONNA MESS WITH A LITTLE BIRD LIKE THAT. THEY GOT ENOUGH ON THEIR HANDS. YOU KNOW BACK IN PHILLY WE FOUND A BOAT IN THE MIDDLE OF INDEPENDENCE SQUARE. SOMEBODY TRYIN' TO CARRY IT TO THE RIVER, I GUESS. DIDN'T MAKE IT. DAMN THING SAT THERE FOR EIGHT DAYS.
Peter => SOMEBODY FINALLY GOT IT, THOUGH. IT COMES DOWN TO HOW MUCH ITS WORTH.
Steve => FRANNIE...

Steve => COME ON...GET SOME SLEEP.
Steve => FRANNIE. COME ON.
Steve => I'M NOT JUST BEING STUBBORN. I REALLY THINK THIS IS BETTER. HELL. YOU'RE THE ONE'S BEEN WANTIN' TO SET UP HOUSE.
Voice => ...NOT ACTUALLY CANNIBALISM...CANNIBALISM IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD, IMPLIES AN INTRASPECIE ACTIVITY... THESE CREATURES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED HUMAN..THEY PREY ON HUMANS...THEY DO NOT PREY ON EACH OTHER.
Voice => THEY ATTACK AND...AND FEED...ONLY ON WARM HUMAN FLESH...
Voice => INTELLIGENCE? SEEMINGLY LITTLE OR NO REASONING POWER. WHAT BASIC SKILLS REMAIN ARE MORE REMEMBERED BEHAVIOURS FROM...FROM NORMAL LIFE.
Voice => THERE ARE REPORTS OF THE CREATURES USING TOOLS, BUT EVEN THESE ACTIONS ARE THE MOST PRIMITIVE... THE USE OF EXTERNAL ARTICLES AS BLUDGEONS ETC., EVEN ANIMALS WILL ADOPT THE BASIC USE OF TOOLS IN THIS MANNER.
Voice => THESE CREATURES ARE NOTHING BUT PURE, MOTORISED INSTINCT...
389    Voice => THEIR ONLY DRIVE IS FOR THE FOOD WHICH SUSTAINS THEM. WE MUST NOT BE LULLED BY THE CONCEPT THAT THESE ARE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS OR OUR FRIENDS. THEY WILL NOT RESPOND TO SUCH EMOTIONS. THEY MUST BE DESTROYED ON SIGHT....
393    Steve => YOU SURE WE CAN START 'EM.
Roger => YOU HAVEN'T SPENT ENOUGH TIME ON THE STREET.
Peter => WELL LET'S GET IT UP. THERE'S NOT TOO MANY OF 'EM AROUND YET THIS MORNIN'.
Roger => HEY, FRAN...
Fran => I WOULD HAVE MADE COFFEE AND BREAKFAST, BUT I DON'T HAVE MY POTS AND PANS.
Fran => CAN I SAY SOMETHING?
Steve => SURE. WHAT DP YOU MEAN?
Fran => I'M SORRY YOU FOUND OUT I'M PREGNANT, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ANY OF YOU TO TREAT ME DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU'D TREAT ANOTHER GUY.
Steve => HEY, FRANNIE, COME ON...
Fran => AND,...I'M NOT GONNA BE DEN MOTHER FOR YOU GUYS.
Fran => AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. AND I WANT SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE PLANS. THERE'S FOUR OF US, OK?
Steve => JESUS, FRAN...
Peter => FAIR ENOUGH!
Fran => NOW. WHAT'S GOIN' ON?
Peter => WE'RE GOIN' OUT.
Peter => ...AND YOU ARE NOT COMING WITH US!
Peter => AND YOU WILL NOT COME WITH US UNTIL YOU CAN HANDLE YOURSELF. THAT MEANS LEARN TO SHOOT AND LEARN TO FIGHT.
Fran => SOMETHING ELSE.
Fran => I DON'T KNOW ANOUT YOU TWO, BUT I WANNA LEARN HOW TO FLY THAT HELICOPTER.
Fran => IF ANYTHING HAPPENS...WE'VE GOTTA BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF HERE.
Peter => SHE'S RIGHT, FLYBOY. COME ON, LET'S GO.
Fran => AND YOU'RE NOT LEAVING ME WITHOUT A GUN AGAIN.
Fran => I JUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT.
Fran => I'M SORRY, STEPHEN.
Steve => I KNOW...I KNOW...IT'S ALRIGHT!
Fran => STEPHEN
Steve => YEAH.
Fran => BE CAREFUL.
Steve => YEAH, WE'LL BE ALRIGHT.

Peter => ALRIGHT, NOW YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU BETTER SCREW YOUR FUCKIN' HEAD ON, BABY!
Roger => YEAH, YEAH...I'M O.K. LET'S GO.
Peter => I MEAN IT! NOW YOU'RE NOT JUST PLAYIN' WITH YOUR LIFE, YOUR PLAYIN' WITH MINE!
Peter =>  ALRIGHT, NOW ARE YOU STRAIGHT?
Roger => YEAH.
Peter => THAT'S IT.
Roger => BULL SHIT.
Peter => WE GOTTA DEAL WITH THAT LEG!
Roger => I'M DEALIN' WITH IT...I'M DEALIN' WITH IT FINE! I WON'T BE ABLE TO WALK ON THIS AT ALL IF WE WAIT.
Peter => CAN YOU WALK ON IT NOW?
Roger => YOUR DAMN RIGHT, I CAN...DAMN RIGHT, I CAN!
Roger => I STOP MOVIN' THIS LEG...MAY NOT EVER GET IT GOIN' AGAIN...THERE'S A LOT TO GET DONE BEFORE...BEFORE YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE ME...
Peter => IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW MANY OF THEM ARE STILL INSIDE. THAT'S A LONG HAUL BETWEEN THOSE ENTRANCES.
Steve => WELL IF WE CAN GET SOME MORE FLARES...OR MAYBE SOME OF THOSE PROPANE JOBS.
Peter => THE GUNS ARE FIRST. GUNS AND AMMUNITION.
Peter => YOU SURE YOU GONNA MAKE IT, BUDDY?
Roger => JUST HURRY UP WITH THAT!
Peter => DON'T TRY TO SHOOT THROUGH THOSE GATES. OPENINGS ARE TOO SMALL. BULLET'LL WIND UP CHASIN' US AROUND IN HERE.
Peter => HE CAN'T GET THROUGH...COME ON...
Peter => AIN'T IT A CRIME!
Steve => WHAT?
Peter =>  THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD EVER MISS WITH THIS GUN...IS THE SUCKER WITH THE BREAD TO BUY IT.
499    Peter =>  YOU JUST WAIT OUT THERE, SISSIES... WE COMIN'...AND WE READY!
Peter => HOW'S THE RIDE?
Roger => KIND BUMPY. WATCH IT.
Peter => LOOK HERE...I...
Roger => I KNOW, I KNOW...SHUT UP.
Peter => UNLOCK THE MIDDLE ONE LAST.
Peter => ALRIGHT...THE TOUGHEST PART'LL BE GETTIN' BY THESE RIGHT HERE...
Steve => IT'S A LONG HAUL DOWN TO THE ENTRANCE.
512    Peter => WE'LL BE ALRIGHT!
Fran => IT'S TOO FAR!
Peter => THERE'S NO BACKIN' OUT NOW. WE GOTTA LOCK THOSE DOORS!
Fran => WE'LL NEVER MAKE ALL FOUR. IT'S TOO RISKY.

Peter => SAFETY STUFF...PRETTY INDESTRUCTIBLE...THEY GOT NO LEVERAGE UNDER THE TRUCK.. GIMME THE ALARMS...
Peter => I'M HOPIN' THEY'LL JUST GO AWAY AFTER THEY FIND THEY CAN'T GET IN...
Steve => WE'RE OK...WE GOT IT MADE...IT'GONNA WORK.
Steve => HOW MANY YOU FIGURE ARE ALREADY IN...
Peter => DUNNO. NOT TOO MANY. WE'LL GET 'EM EASY. WE GET IT ALL LOCKED OFF AND WE'RE GOIN' ON A HUNT!
Peter => WE PUT UP THE WALL HERE. THERE'S NO DOOR FROM THE LAST OFFICE INTO THE WASHROOMS, SO NOBODY'LL GET NOSEY...AND THIS WAY WE CAN STILL GET TO THE PLUMBING...
Steve => WHY CAN'T WE JUST BOARD UP THE STAIRWAY. HELL, THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH A STACK OF CARTONS.
Peter => I'M NOT JUST WORRYIN' ABOUT THEM. SOONER OR LATER MIGHT BE A PATROL THROUGH HERE...LOOTERS MAYBE...I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO EVEN KNOW THAT STAIRWAY EXISTS.
Peter => THE DUCTWORK RUNS ALL THE WAY INTO THE WASHROOMS. WE'LL HAVE TO GET IN AND OUT THAT WAY. WE'LL BRING UP ANY BUG STUFF WE WANT BEFORE WE PUT UP THE WALL.
563    Fran => HE SEEMS TO BE SLEEPING.
Peter => GOOD.
Fran => I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO...
Steve => YOU'RE DOIN' FINE.

Scientist => I'VE GOT TO...BE CAREFUL WITH WORDS HERE...WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO STUDY THEIR HABITS...WE'VE REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR A LIVE CAPTURE SO WE CAN HAVE CONTROLLED STUDY...WE NEED SUPPLY AND DEMAND RATIOS.
Comm. => YOU MEAN...THEIR NEED VERSUS...
Scientist => VERSUS THE AMOUNT OF FOOD AVAILABLE. LETS BE BLUNT.
607    Steve => JESUS CHRIST.
608    Scientist => PROJECT OUT THEIR RATE OF GROWTH...THERE'S A CRITICAL BALANCE...AND IT'S THE WASTE THAT KILLS US. LITERALLY...THEY USE...THEY USE MAYBE FIVE PERCENT OF THE FOOD AVAILABLE ON THE HUMAN BODY...AND THEN THE BODY IS USUALLY INTACT ENOUGH TO BE MOBILE WHEN IT REVIVES. THERE'S AN ECOLOGICAL IMBALANCE AND THEY'RE INCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING...
Comm. => WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING?
Scientist => WE HAVE TO BE UNEMOTIONAL...WE HAVE TO PROVIDE COUNTER MEASURES OR WE'RE ALL...
Comm. => COUNTER MEASURES?
Scientist => THEY CAN'T CONTROL THE RATE OF GROWTH AND CON- SUMPTION...WE HAVE TO CONTROL IT FOR THEM!

Scientist => I'M PROPOSING THAT CERTAIN...NECESSARY MEASURES BE PUT INTO EFFECT AT ONCE...MEASURES APPLYING TO ALL OFFICIAL SEARCH AND DESTROY UNITS, WHILE THEY'RE STILL OPERATIVE...HOSPITALS...RESCUE STATIONS...AND ANY...PRIVATE CITIZENS...
Scientist => IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE MOBILE UNITS OF THE O.B.P. THE CORPSES OF THE RECENTLY DEAD SHOULD BE DELIVERED OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES FOR COLLECTION IN REFRIGERATED VANS...THEY SHOULD BE DECAPITATED TO PREVENT REVIVAL...
Scientist => THIS COLLECTION...THIS COLLECTION...
Scientist => THIS COLLECTION COULD BE...STORED...RATIONED... FOR DISTRIBUTION AMONG THE INFECTED SOCIETY...
Scientist => THE DISSECTION...THE DISSECTION OF THE CORPSES CAN BE CARRIED OUT...CARRIED OUT WITH RESPECT FOR THE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN BODY...
