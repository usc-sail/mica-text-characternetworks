HARVEY => Put my score up first.
JOHNNIE => They don't want to hear it, Harvey.
HARVEY => I know, but I want to hear it. Put it up.
JOHNNIE => I'm backed up already, Harvey.
HARVEY =>  Johnnie, you were the one that was late. Just put it up.
JOHNNIE => Listen, Harvey. Marvin wants me to present my ideas while your away.
HARVEY => Huh?
JOHNNIE => Look, I'm not doing myself any favours here, Harvey. But, I'd watch your back.
HARVEY => Marvin? Hey, Marvin?
MARVIN => Hey, Harvey. Shouldn't you be in London?
HARVEY => Yeah, I'm heading there now. What's going on?
MARVIN => Huh?
HARVEY => Johnnie said something about you wanting him to present on Monday.
MARVIN => Oh yeah, No, I was just thinking that, what with you being in London - you should stay a while.
HARVEY => What?
MARVIN => There's no need to rush back. Enjoy your daughter's wedding.
HARVEY => What?
MARVIN => Well, Johnnie can do it. I mean, he can pitch the Samuelson account.
HARVEY => No, I'm coming back. Those are my connections. They have been for years.
MARVIN => I know but... they've got new people running things over there. I think they're after something...  ...different.
HARVEY => I want to come back. I should be there in person.
MARVIN => `There in person'? Harvey, nobody cares.
HARVEY => I have to stand behind my music!
MARVIN => They're demos! - They're already pressed. No one needs to be there. They're not looking for you, they're not looking for me. They just need a fucking track.  Harvey, you haven't booked a top line in 8 months.
HARVEY => You got me doing triangle chimes for Christ's sake - give me something to compose!
MARVIN => That's what I'm trying to tell you! It's not about composition! It's different now!
MARVIN => What?
HARVEY => I'm back on Monday, Marvin. I'm coming back.
MARVIN =>  You got to land this one, Harvey.
HARVEY => What are you saying?  Say it!
MARVIN => I'm saying there are no more chances, Harvey.  Enjoy London.
HARVEY => Shit!
HARVEY =>  Miss? I'm sorry. I've spilt my drink.
STEWARDESS => I'll get you some napkins.
HARVEY =>  Why's it always me?
STEWARDESS => Shall I take that?
HARVEY => Thanks... And could I get another?
STEWARDESS => A whiskey, wasn't it?
HARVEY => Yes. `Jamesons', no ice.
HARVEY => A holiday?
WOMAN => No. Business.
WOMAN =>  Yourself?
HARVEY => My daughter's getting married.
WOMAN => Congratulations.
HARVEY =>  Thank you.  She's marrying an American. But for some reason we've all got to go over to London.  I told her we had a perfectly good wedding system here. 
HARVEY =>  They both work there, you see.
HARVEY => Thank you.
WOMAN => I'm really sorry but I have a meeting in the morning and I must try and get some sleep.
HARVEY => No... Of course. I'm sorry.
WOMAN => It's just, I'll be useless - unless I get some sleep.
HARVEY => Sure.
POSTMAN => Morning Kate. Looking lovely as ever. If I was younger...
KATE => Careful Paddy.  Blushing! Is she up?
POSTMAN => Oh yes.
KATE =>  Mum. It's me - your daughter.
MAGGIE => Hello, my daughter.
MAGGIE => Have a cup of tea with me.
KATE => I can't, I'm running late.
MAGGIE => He's at it again.
KATE =>  Who? At what?
MAGGIE => The neighbour. Barbecuing or something.
MAGGIE => I heard he's from Poland.
KATE =>  So maybe Polish people like to barbecue a lot. I'm leaving your prescription on the table.  You know, you don't have to keep taking these - the Doctor said.
MAGGIE => I like to. It makes me feel better.  Its 8 o'clock in the morning. Who barbecues at 8?
KATE =>  I've got to go. I'll call you later.
MAGGIE => Of course. Don't worry about me. I'll be Ok.  Have you got that date thing tonight?
KATE => I don't know, maybe.  Bye Mum.
MAGGIE => `Time and tide', Kate, as your father liked to say.
KATE => Was that from his terrace in the South of France?
KATE => I'm sorry. That was mean.  
KATE => Look, I'll call you later.  I love you.
KATE => Aggie.
AGGIE => Morning darling.
AGGIE => Four across. A filmy layer on the surface of a liquid?
KATE => Scum.
OONAGH => Sorry. Sorry.
OONAGH => Thank God you're my boss.
OONAGH => Are we still on for tonight? Matt's definitely bringing Simon.
KATE => No.
OONAGH => Please.
KATE => Only if you guys swear you won't leave if it's not going well.
OONAGH => No way.
KATE => Promise?
OONAGH => Promise.
AGGIE => Seven down. Another word for `souvenir'?
KATE => Memento.
OONAGH => Aggie, why do you bother? You just get Kate to give you all the answers.
KATE => So you spent the whole 2 weeks in the Toronto area?
ELDERLY MAN => Yes. Our daughter lives there, see.
KATE => Ah.  So not a business trip then?
ELDERLY MAN => Oh, no. Unless you count grand- children as work.
KATE =>  Some might.
KATE => Sorry, I couldn't just ask you a few very quick questions, could I?
HARVEY => I'm sorry, but I'm in a bit of a hurry.
KATE => It won't take a moment.
HARVEY =>  Look, I'm sorry, but I'm tired, you know?
KATE => Yes. I do.
HARVEY => I'm sorry.
HARVEY => Hi Suzie, it's your Dad. I've made it in one piece. I'm in a Taxi on my way to the Hotel. I guess i'll see you all there. Can't wait. Love you.
HARVEY => Hi, it's Harvey, Harvey Shine here. Just wanted to confirm Mike for Monday. I'm in London at the moment, but reachable on my cell. Which is... Well you've probably got it on file, but just in case, 917... Well you may have to dial an international code first, I'm not sure. Anyway, it's 917 749 7558. That's 917 74...
HARVEY => Hi. I'm with the wedding party. There should be a room for me. Harvey Shine.
CONCIERGE => Yes. I have a double room for you.
HARVEY => Good. Has everyone else checked in?
CONCIERGE => I'm not sure, sir.
HARVEY => My daughter. Susan Shine. Or maybe she's already going by Wright. Susan Wright.
CONCIERGE => No, sir. No one of that name.
HARVEY => Do you have a Mrs Pearce?
CONCIERGE => No, sir.
HARVEY => I'll go up.
HARVEY => Hello?  Suzie! Hi darling. Yes, I'm here. Where are you - where is everyone? (listens/Harvey's face drops a little) Oh...I see. No, I didn't realise. I thought the plan was for everyone to stay together.
HARVEY => No its...fine. I just wasn't sure.  
HARVEY => So your mother has rented a house for you all.  I see. No, no, don't be silly. I'm a big boy. It's fine.
HARVEY => Home from home.  Yes, I've got the address. So, I'll see you there.  I love you too. Bye.
KATE => Mum?
MAGGIE => What are you wearing?
KATE => Dungarees.
MAGGIE => Oh, you're not!
KATE => They're completely in again, haven't you heard?
MAGGIE =>  Oh, you're just being silly.
MAGGIE => Now don't be nervous. Just be yourself.
KATE =>  Ok, mum. Thanks for the advice.
MAGGIE => Oh, listen. I've been thinking about Greece for our holiday.
KATE =>  Ok, Let's talk about it later.  I love you too.
KATE => Sorry i'm late.
OONAGH => Don't tell me... (makes the gesture of a telephone) ...your mother?
KATE => She's worrying about her new neighbour. Says he barbecues a lot.
OONAGH => Very suspicious.
KATE =>  I know.
OONAGH => I got you the same as me.  They're at the bar. He seems very nice.
MATT => Hey Kate.
KATE => Hi Matt.
MATT => Kate, this is Simon.
SIMON => Hi.
KATE => Hi.  You work with Matt?
SIMON => Yes. If you can call it work.
KATE =>  Right.
OONAGH => Come on, i'm feeling small down here. Sit!
VOICE => Room service.
HARVEY => Just over by the bed. Thank you. Hello?
HARVEY => Careful!
HARVEY => Are you Ok?
HARVEY => Are you sure? Here.
HARVEY => Hello?
HARVEY => Fuck!
SCOTT => Harvey.
HARVEY => Scott.
SCOTT => You made it.
HARVEY => Yes.
SCOTT => This is Susan's father, Harvey. Harvey Shine.  Harvey, this is my best man, Josh Stillman and Pete Turner.
HARVEY => Hi.
FRIENDS => Hi.
SCOTT => How are you Harvey? (glancing at Harvey's attire) Its great to see you.
HARVEY => Good thanks. Great.  How are you holding up?
SCOTT => Great.  Can't wait to marry your daughter, really.
HARVEY => No...  Is she..?
SCOTT => She's through there. She'll be thrilled you're here. I'll go and find her.
HARVEY => Sorry.
HARVEY => Yes.  No, no, that's not right. I booked Mike. It's important. I spoke to him about it two weeks ago. I booked him.  Have you told him its Harvey. It's really important... (suddenly conscious of Scott's friends standing nearby) Just...Just get him to call me, Ok?
HARVEY => Sorry.  Always something.
JOSH => Sure.  What's your field, Harvey?
HARVEY => Oh, I'm a...  I work in the music industry.
JOSH => Wow. Doing what?
HARVEY => I'm a composer.  Sort of.
PETE => Cool. What kind of stuff?
HARVEY => Oh, you know, for...commercials, that sort of thing. TV.  Mostly background stuff, that sort of thing.
JOSH => I see.
PETE => Sounds profitable.
HARVEY => It can be. (wanting to change subject) You guys work with Scott?
PETE/JOSH => Yes.
HARVEY => Oil, right?
JOSH => Futures, yes.
HARVEY => Well, I'm sure that's pretty profitable too.
JOSH => Sometimes, yes.
HARVEY => Well, I'd better find my daughter.
PETE => Absolutely. Good to meet you, Harvey. See you in there.
OONAGH => So?
KATE => He seems nice.
OONAGH => Nice? Nice like good. Or nice like dull.
KATE => Nice like how old is he?
OONAGH => Old enough. Your age...ish.
KATE => He can't be, he's looks like a baby.
OONAGH => Alright, my age. But Matt says he's very mature.
KATE => Oh right. Did Matt offer that up - or was that in response to you two discussing my approaching barrenness.
OONAGH => Kate?
OONAGH => Don't answer it.
KATE => I have to. She's on her own.  She gets lonely.
OONAGH => Just tell her you're busy.
KATE => Mum?
SUSAN => Hi Dad.
HARVEY => Suz...  You look beautiful.
SUSAN => Thank you.
HARVEY => Give us a hug then, as they say in this country.
HARVEY => I know, I look ridiculous.
SUSAN => No. You look...
HARVEY => Like a bad lounge act.
HARVEY => I spilt something on my trousers.  I've been doing that a lot recently.
SUSAN => Dad.
HARVEY => Long way to come to see two American kids get married.
SUSAN => Sorry for the inconvenience, Dad.
HARVEY => Sorry.
SUSAN => Have you seen mum yet?
HARVEY => No. They're here?
SUSAN => Yes. They're over by our table.
SUSAN => Please Daddy.
HARVEY => What?  I'll be good.
SCOTT => Look who i've got!
HARVEY => I'll speak to you later Suz. You enjoy your friends.
OONAGH =>  We've gotta go. Problem at home. Baby-sitter just rang. Nothing serious. 
OONAGH =>  But you guys stay.
OONAGH =>  Enjoy yourself - you miserable cow. And turn off that phone.  Are you working tomorrow?
KATE => Yes. Half-day.
OONAGH => I'll see you Tuesday.
SIMON => Looks like we've been set up.
KATE => Yes.  Sorry.
SIMON => No. It's not your fault. I mean, I'm fine with it. I mean, I'm happy to meet new people.
KATE => Yes, me too.
SIMON => Why don't you sit down?
KATE => Yes.
SIMON => So you're Oonagh's boss?
KATE => Yes.  Sorry, I'm saying `yes' a lot.
SIMON => Yes.  You are.
SIMON => Do you want another drink?
KATE => Ye...  Sure. I can get them.
SIMON => No, it's fine. What do you fancy?
KATE => I'll have another white wine. Anything dry.
JEAN => Harvey.
HARVEY => Jean.
HARVEY => Brian.
BRIAN => Harvey. Good to see you.
HARVEY =>  So our baby girl is really getting married. Who would've thought?
JEAN => Yes.
BRIAN => Harvey you remember the Watsons. Barry and Jill.
HARVEY =>  Of course I do. Hell, its been a while. I guess, not since Jean and I split up.
JILL => Hi Harvey. You look well.
HARVEY => Thank you, Jill. You're looking well too. Both of you. I guess you guys stayed in touch with Jean.
BRIAN => Barry and I work together now.
HARVEY => No kidding? Insurance?
BARRY => No.  Property, now. A small portfolio down in Florida.
HARVEY => Real Estate. That's great.  That's really great.
BRIAN => Well I think we should sit. I know Susan wanted us all seated before they joined us.
HARVEY => Sure. Good idea.
HARVEY => Sorry, I have to take this.  Can you hold a minute?
HARVEY => Sorry. Sorry.
KATE => Mum. You've got to stop calling.  What? I can't hear. Hold on.
HARVEY =>  It'll take two hours max. No longer.  Have you told him its Harvey? Look, we go back! He'll tell you. Just have him call me.
HARVEY => Sorry...
HARVEY =>  Did you move me darling?
JEAN => No, Harvey. I didn't touch it.
SUSAN => Dad. I moved you. I thought it might be easier in case you needed to get out.
HARVEY => Ok, sweetheart.
BRIAN => Shall we have a quick toast to get things going?  I'm going to save my big speech for tomorrow.  Dear Susan and Dear Scott, I just want to take us all back to that wonderful holiday we all had in Rome together last year and wish you `Salute'!
EVERYONE => Salute!
BRIAN => Jean and I love you both so much. And we're so happy that Scott is going to part of our clan now. And so I say many, many, happy, happy years ahead. Salute!
EVERYONE => Salute!
HARVEY => My turn?
HARVEY => Sorry.
HARVEY => Sorry, I thought it was off. (flustered he finally manages to stop it buzzing) Um, uh.  To Susan and Scott. A great couple.  Cheers.
EVERYONE => Cheers.
SUSAN => Let's eat.
EVERYONE => Yes...
KATE => Hi.
SIMON => Hey. Kate.  Sorry, i bumped into these guys and couldn't shake them.  Everyone this is Kate.
KATE => Hi.
SIMON => Kate this is Andrew, Melissa, Gwen, and Elinor.
EVERYONE => Hi.
MELISSA => Sorry, I hope we're not barging in on your evening.
MELISSA => It was Simon's idea. How do you guys know each other, anyway?
KATE => We don't really. We just met.
MELISSA => A blind date?
SIMON => No.  We met through friends.
MELISSA => I see. I think we should leave you guys alone.
KATE =>  No.  Don't. Stay. It's fine.
ANDREW => Hey does anyone know the cricket score?
SIMON => England were all out by tea, when I last checked.
ANDREW => Bloody hell.
GWEN => Cricket. Don't get it.
MELISSA => What? Men in white. Oh, I do.
GWEN => I heard that they did it in her bedroom, while she was away.
SIMON => It was her flat?
GWEN => Yep. He has his own, but was basically living at hers.
ANDREW => Ouch.
MELISSA => That is evil.
JEAN => Harvey.
HARVEY => Hello Jean.
JEAN =>  Can I get a glass of water please?
JEAN => You Ok?
HARVEY =>  Fine.
JEAN => Go easy Harvey.
HARVEY =>  Why, Jean? Are you worried i'm going to embarrass you again?
JEAN => No Harvey, I'm worried you're going to embarrass yourself.  And more importantly Susan. This weekend's just about her and Scott. Nothing else.
HARVEY => Oh, you're good Jean. You're really good. You've always known how to make me feel shit, haven't you?  You've always been so good at that.
JEAN => I've had cause to practice.
HARVEY => Tell me, Jean. Were you ever proud of me?
JEAN => Yes. Sometimes.  But you never listened.
HARVEY => The parties Jean. The fuckin' parties, where I would hear you - dressing up what I did for a living - film composer this, film composer that - trying to make it more palatable for your friends. I'm a...
JEAN =>  Don't Harvey.
HARVEY => What is it you see in Brian?
JEAN => He doesn't talk about himself.  He talks about me.
JEAN => Go home Harvey. Go to bed and see your daughter get married tomorrow.
SUSAN => Hi Dad.
HARVEY => Hey Suz.
SUSAN => Are you alright?
HARVEY =>  Yeah. I'm great. How are you doing? Enjoying yourself?
SUSAN => Yeah.
HARVEY => He seems a good guy, Scott. You'll be alright.
SUSAN => Yeah, he is.  I'm sorry, I haven't had much time to talk to you.
HARVEY => No Sweetheart, it's your weekend. It's no problem. You just enjoy yourself.
SUSAN => How's work?
HARVEY => Great.  Well, not great, but...fine. You know the usual. Triangle chimes.
SUSAN => Are you still doing your own stuff? You should.
HARVEY => A bit... Not so much.
HARVEY => Listen Suz, I'm really sorry about having to leave early. It's just bad timing. There's a sudden rush at work, you know, a couple of big jobs in at once.
SUSAN => Sure.
HARVEY => It just can't be helped. But I'll be there at the ceremony, at the really important bit. I'll be there to give you away.  And then I'm sure Brian or your mother will talk at the reception. You know me, I've never been very good at speech...
SUSAN =>  Dad.
HARVEY => Yeah, Suz?
SUSAN => Listen, I've been thinking.  
SUSAN => Brian has been a really big part of my life now for some time. And...  And I'm going to ask him to give me away tomorrow.
SUSAN => I'm sorry, Dad.
HARVEY => But Suz...
SUSAN => Dad, I've hardly seen you in the past five years.
HARVEY => That's not true.
SUSAN => Dad, it is. Maybe a quick coffee here, or a telephone call there but no, you haven't been part of my life. And...  And Brian has.
SUSAN => You having to leave early this weekend. I don't know, it just seems typical.
HARVEY =>  It's work darling. It pays for things.  Sorry. Look, I...
SUSAN =>  I'm sorry Dad, but it's what I've decided.
HARVEY => Sure.  I understand, Suz.
HARVEY => You go and be with your friends. Go and enjoy yourself.  I gotta make some stupid calls. You know. Go and enjoy yourself, Sweetheart. I'll see you tomorrow.
HARVEY => You fuckin' asshole!
KATE => Sorry.
HARVEY => Hello?
HARVEY => Is there another way we could try?
TAXI DRIVER => It's going to be bad everywhere. Your president's in town. It's causing chaos.
KATE => Mum?
HARVEY => I'm sorry but, I'm on the 4.30 to JFK.
WAITING PASSENGER => Hey pal, we're all in hurry.
HARVEY => Just hand luggage, can i go straight to the gate?
STEWARD => Sir, I'm dealing with a passenger, you'll have to wait.
HARVEY => Please. I've gotta make that flight.
STEWARD => Sir, everyone is in a hurry. You'll just have to wait.
HARVEY => Miss, i'm on the 4.30 to JFK. Can you check me in?
STEWARD #2 => I'm afraid that flight's now closed.
HARVEY => But it's not yet 4! I just have hand luggage. It doesn't take off for another 40 minutes.
STEWARD #2 => I'm sorry sir, but we have to close the gate 45 minutes prior to departure.
HARVEY => But I just have hand luggage. Please. I've got to get on that flight.
STEWARD #2 => I'm sorry sir, there's nothing I can do.
HARVEY => When's the next flight?
STEWARD #2 => There's one at 8.30. But I     know that's full. I can put you     on stand- by, but I doubt you'll get     on.  The earliest I can get you     on for sure, is tomorrow morning,     10.30.
HARVEY =>  Jesus!
STEWARD #2 => Sir, I'm sorry, but you have to stay calm.
HARVEY => Marvin. It's Harvey. Listen, there's been a mess up, the traffic was crazy. I'm going to have to reschedule the pitch slightly. Frank can set up. I'll email him the cue numbers - he knows what to do. And then I'll be there lunch- time at the latest. I'll come straight from the airport. I'll try you again shortly.
HARVEY => Hello?
MARVIN => I got your message.
HARVEY => The traffic was insane. But listen...
MARVIN =>  The traffic, Harvey? Jesus!
MARVIN => Listen, Harvey. Stay in London. Enjoy your daughter's wedding. We'll talk when you get back.
HARVEY => It's fine, I'll be there lunch- time. It's no problem. Steve knows what I need. Mike's coming in. It's all set u...
MARVIN =>  Harvey!
MARVIN => It's over.  It's out of my hands Harvey. I have people to answer to. We just can't afford the space.  We're letting you go.
HARVEY => Letting me go? Can't afford the space? Marvin, I'll be there lunch- time.
MARVIN => I'm sorry Harvey.  Call me when you get back.
HARVEY => Jamesons, no ice.
HARVEY => Another.  Please.
HARVEY => Another, please.
HARVEY => What?
BAR MAN => Sorry.
HARVEY => Shit!
HARVEY => Sorry. Vulgar American.
HARVEY =>  I know, we don't raise our voices in this country. It's not done.
HARVEY =>  I'm sorry.
KATE => For what?
HARVEY => For yesterday. I was rude. You tried to ask me some questions.
HARVEY => You were just trying to do your job and I was rude.
KATE => I don't really remember, but I'm sure you were. Most people are.
HARVEY => Good book?
KATE => It probably would be, if i could finish it.
HARVEY =>  I get it.
KATE => That'll help.
HARVEY =>  Sorry?
KATE => I said, that'll help.
HARVEY => Believe me, it will.
KATE => Right.
HARVEY => I reckon it'll help as much as that trashy novel and a glass of chardonnay.
KATE => O-kay.
HARVEY => I'm really sorry. That was out of line.
KATE =>  What? Go away and stop apologizing.
HARVEY => It's just that i've had a really shitty day.
KATE =>  Join the club.
HARVEY => No. I mean really shitty. Yours may have been shitty, but mine was shittier.
KATE => How shitty?
HARVEY => I missed my flight. I lost my job. And my daughter who got married in London today asked her step father rather than me to give her away.
KATE => Not bad.  But what can I do for you?  Make it worse, maybe?
HARVEY => Let me make it up to you.  Would you let me buy you lunch. What time is it - tea time? I'll buy you tea.
KATE => That's very sweet of you, but... I don't know you. And... you don't know me.
HARVEY => Exactly. That's why we should have lunch - tea.
KATE => Thank you, but...no.
HARVEY => Because you've got your book. And it's a good replacement for humans.
HARVEY => If that's for me I'm in the shower.
HARVEY => Aren't you going to answer that?
KATE => No.
HARVEY => Should I take that as a hopeful sign.
KATE => If it is, you could just give me a little wider smile.
HARVEY => Look we are having lunch together.
KATE =>  No. We're having lunch next to each other.
HARVEY => Ah. (beat/suddenly holds out his hand) I'm Harvey. Harvey Shine.
KATE =>  Kate. Kate Walker.
KATE => So why aren't you at the wedding?
HARVEY => Ah, that's better. I knew something was missing.  I had to get back for a work thing.
KATE =>  A work thing. For the job you just lost?
HARVEY =>  Yes.
KATE =>  I see.  So, this job you lost. You liked it?
HARVEY =>  Yes.  No. Not really. They've beaten it out of me. But its what i do - did.
KATE =>  Which is - was?
HARVEY =>  I'm a composer.  I write jingles.
KATE => Wow.
HARVEY => That's about the normal response.
KATE => Anything I would of heard?
HARVEY => Yes. Uh...Uh...  Well, maybe, I mean it maybe before your time.
KATE =>  No, go on.
HARVEY =>  You can take the Salem out of the country - but you can't take the country out of Salem.
KATE => No.
HARVEY => It's a cigarette.
KATE => Oh really?
HARVEY => Forget it.
KATE => Ok.
KATE =>  Did you always want to write jingles or was there something more?
KATE => What?
HARVEY => No, I just love the way you...you just cut through it.
KATE => I'll take that as a compliment.
HARVEY => You should.  I was going to be a Jazz pianist.
KATE => Were you good?
HARVEY => No. Not enough.
KATE => I'm sorry, I can be nosey. I tend to blurt stuff out.
HARVEY => No. I like it. I like it...  ...Alot.
HARVEY => It's a relief to find someone in this country who actually says what they feel.
KATE => Oh, haven't you heard?
HARVEY => What?
KATE => That's all changed. We're a nation changed. Ever since Diana, we've unlocked ourselves. Everything's flowing out.  You guys showed us the way.
HARVEY => Just as we're trying to adopt your stiff upper lip.
HARVEY => What is a stiff upper lip, exactly?
KATE => No, I think, it's more this.
HARVEY => I see.  How's that?
KATE =>  Yeah you're getting there. Stretch it out further.
HARVEY => Let me see again.
KATE => No, now you're doing a bulldog.
HARVEY => Like this?
KATE => No, now you look like you don't have any teeth.  Are they your own?
HARVEY => What?
KATE => Your teeth?
HARVEY => The front ones.
KATE => My dad had a front one that you could just take out.
HARVEY => Really?
KATE => Thank you. I...enjoyed myself.
HARVEY => Yes. So did I.
KATE => I should get going. I have a class.
HARVEY => A class?
KATE =>  Yes. A...writing class.  Twice a week. Just something I do.  
KATE => I take the Heathrow Express. What about you?
HARVEY => I don't know. I guess I'll stay in a Hotel near here. My flight's in the morning.
KATE => Well...it's been a pleasure...Harvey Shine.
HARVEY => Yes. Yes it has.
HARVEY => There's your phone again.
KATE => Yes.  Sorry. I'd better go.
HARVEY => I'd like a room please.  One night.
MAN => Sorry. Excuse me.
HARVEY => Sorry.
HARVEY => Sorry.  Hi.  I thought i might as well stay in town. More fun than a hotel next to a runway, right?
KATE => Taxi's are over there. They'll take you to wherever you need to go.
KATE => So, I guess it's goodbye again.
HARVEY => Yes. (looks up at the evening sky/beat) So, I couldn't walk you to your class, could I?  Carry your books?  Stand near the curb so you don't get splashed.
KATE => Sure.
HARVEY => Is that a yes?
KATE => Yes.  Why not?
HARVEY => Yours is a beautiful city, Kate.
HARVEY => What?
KATE => Its just a funny way of saying it. Quite old fashioned.
HARVEY => Really?
KATE => But i like it.  Yours is glorious country, Honeychurch.
KATE => It's a line from a book. `Room with a View'.
HARVEY => I'm afraid I'm not much of a reader.  Too fidgety, I guess.
HARVEY => You think less of me.
KATE => No, we're just quite different, that's all.
HARVEY => Is that bad?
KATE =>  No.
HARVEY => Both our phones ring a lot. We have that in common.
KATE =>  Ah.
KATE => Sorry. I should probably take this.
KATE => Mum?  I've been busy.  No, I'm out. Yes with someone. No someone else.  Yes.  ...a man.
KATE => You did, did you?  An actual body.
KATE => Mum. Listen. I'll come over tomorrow and we can check it out together.  I have to go now. Just get an early night and i'll see you tomorrow.  I love you too.
KATE => Sorry.  My mother.
HARVEY => She worries about you?
KATE => And herself.  She's convinced she's living next to Poland's answer to Ted Bundy.
HARVEY => I see.
KATE => She means well. She's just had a tough run.  My Father ran off to France with his secretary. Then mum got cancer, about four years ago now. She's fully recovered. But won't admit it.  She's basically bored. And my continued `situation' as she calls it, being single, is her major distraction. Her pastime if you will.
HARVEY => I see.
KATE => Yes, my rotting eggs are her raison d'tre.  Sorry.
HARVEY => No.
KATE => I talk too much.
HARVEY => No. I like it.
KATE => Do you?
HARVEY => Yes.
KATE => Hmm.  Well, here we are. My class.
HARVEY => How long is the class?
KATE => An hour.
HARVEY => Can I wait?  Sorry - I promise I'm not `Bundyish'.
KATE =>  It's getting cold. You don't want to wait.
HARVEY => Yes I do.
KATE =>  Careful, I might get the wrong impression.
HARVEY => What can you do?
HARVEY => How did it go?
KATE => Oh, the usual.  Lovely mild-mannered Mike read us the latest installment from his Physcho-Sexual Thriller, and we all tried to look at him in the same way after.
KATE => Shall we keep walking?
HARVEY => Yes.
KATE => Do you ever wish you could try a different life?  Just for a day. Just to see what it would be like.
HARVEY => What would yours be?
KATE =>  Well, no green, that's for sure.
KATE =>  It would take place in Spain. A little house inland.
HARVEY => And what would you do there?
KATE => Oh...I don't know...  Write the great novel.  I think I've got one inside me. We're not talking high art. Just a bloody good holiday read.
HARVEY => Ok. So this house in Spain would have a little cabana looking out over the plains for you to write in.
KATE =>  Yes.
HARVEY => And a little stream running by, to bathe in.
KATE =>  Sure.
HARVEY => I'm there.  Sorry, that's if you're receiving guests.
KATE => Sure, you can visit Harvey Shine.
HARVEY => Why, thank you Kate Walker.
KATE => What happened Harvey?  Between you and your daughter?
HARVEY => I don't know.  Somewhere along the way I lost her. I lost my family.  I just woke up one morning and realised i didn't belong.
HARVEY => I'd always had this mean little feeling in my stomach, that they were a bit embarrassed by me.  If you saw them now, with Brian, Susan's step-father. You'd see, they make more sense. They look right together.
HARVEY => I've not been a great father.
KATE => The reception. It's still going on?
HARVEY =>  I guess.
KATE => Where?
HARVEY => The Grovesnor. Why?
KATE => You must go.
HARVEY => What?
KATE => What the hell are you doing here? You must go!
HARVEY => She doesn't need me.
KATE => Stop feeling so sorry for yourself. She's your daughter, you're her father. Go!
KATE => Harvey, it would be unforgivable not to go.
KATE => Harvey?
HARVEY => Wait. I'm thinking.  Only if you come with me.
KATE => What?
HARVEY => Please, come with me. As my...bodyguard.  As my friend.
KATE => Harvey, firstly, i'm not about to go to anyone's wedding in a green polyester work suit. Secondly it's not right.
HARVEY => We'll find you a dress. If we find you a dress, will you come?
KATE => No.
HARVEY => Please.
KATE => No.
HARVEY => Please.
KATE => No.
KATE => Come on.
HARVEY => Hey.
SUSAN => Hi.
HARVEY => I didn't go.
SUSAN => I'm glad.
HARVEY => This is Kate. A... friend.
KATE =>  Hi. Congratulations. You look fantastic.
SUSAN => Thank you.
KATE => I'm really sorry to gate-crash. Your father sort of insisted.
SUSAN => No, it's fine. I'm sure...  ...there's room.
HARVEY => You get back. Don't worry about us, we'll find a place.
KATE => Yes...
SUSAN => No.  Could you find them a seat please.
WAITER => Sure.
SUSAN => I'd better go.
PETE => And now for the best man's speech. Except we seem to be missing the bride.  Oh, no, here she is.
JOSH => Scott. What can I say...
WAITER => I'm afraid this is the only place left.
HARVEY => That's fine.
KATE => Hi.
GIRL => Are you Uncle Harvey?
HARVEY => Yes. I guess.
GIRL => I've heard about you.
HARVEY => Oh.  You're not Miriam's kid are you?
GIRL => Yes.
HARVEY => Wow...You've...got big. I mean grown up.
GIRL => I'm fourteen.
HARVEY => Wow.
KATE => Hello.
KATE => Now you're not to dominate the conversation tonight.  Chatterbox to my left.
JOSH => So without further ado, I'd like to propose a toast to Susan for making my friend Scott complete.
PETE => And now ladies and Gentlemen. It is the turn of the Father of the Bride to say a few words. 
PETE => And tonight that task will be carried out by the very charming and distinguished Brian.
BRIAN => Well, that's quite some speech Josh. Quite something to follow. But I shall try...
HARVEY => Um... Excuse me...
HARVEY => Sorry Brian... Sorry to interrupt.
HARVEY => But you see I can't just sit hear and watch somebody else give my baby girl away. Susan's my daughter and I'm her father. Not the best, by far, but her father all the same.
HARVEY => Thanks.
HARVEY => Um... I should have prepared something but... I guess it reminds me of a joke...
HARVEY => Sorry. Um...
JEAN => For God's sake Harvey, don't make a scene.
HARVEY => No Jean. I want to make a scene. You know. I'm tired of being embarrassed.  If we can't make a scene on the day of our daughter's wedding, then when can we? I want to make a scene. I want to shout! I wanna tell the world how lucky it is to have our Suzie in it!
HARVEY => I wanna tell Scott, how damn lucky he is!
UNCLE FRED => Hear, hear!
HARVEY =>  And also if he ever hurts her, I know people in north of London.
HARVEY => Seriously though. Scott, I swear you have found in Susan a bright and passionate person. And a loyal friend.
CONGREGATION => Hear, hear!
HARVEY => And I can see from the way she looks at you. From the way she is with you, that she is...  
HARVEY => ...happy.  And I thank you and welcome you to the family.
HARVEY => And finally, if I can linger a moment longer. I would like to turn it back over to Brian, with a note of... gratitude.  Thank you for being there for my baby girl. Thank you for being there, when I wasn't.
BRIAN => If you would all please join Harvey and I, in a toast.  To Susan and Scott.
CONGREGATION => Susan and Scott!
KATE => Well done.
HARVEY => Really?
PETE => Ladies and Gentlemen, the first dance.
SUSAN => Thanks for coming back Dad.
HARVEY => Thanks for having me back.
KATE => Wow.
KATE => One of yours?
HARVEY => You are very kind. But...no.  Shearing doing Rogers.
KATE => Ah.  Well...you play it very well.
HARVEY =>  Well, thank you Ms. Walker.
KATE => You're most welcome, Mr Shine.
HARVEY => Me thinks you were leaving?
KATE => Indeed I was, Sire.
HARVEY => Why?
KATE => Because you looked happy.
KATE => You should be with your family, Harvey.
HARVEY => But, you know, maybe I want to be with you.  You make me happy - when skies are grey.
KATE => Careful, Harvey. I'm blushing.
HARVEY => Thank you.
KATE => For what?
HARVEY => For making me come here.
KATE => You're welcome.
HARVEY => Can I?
KATE => What?
HARVEY => Can I...?
HARVEY => Hey kid, they're playing our song.
KATE => Yes.
HARVEY =>  Come on. I want you to meet people. I want them to meet you.
PETE => Ladies and Gentlemen. The bride and groom are about to leave. Please join me outside to send them off in style.
SUSAN => Bye Dad.
HARVEY => Bye Suz... Bye Susan.
SUSAN => Be gentle with him.
HARVEY =>  Sorry.
KATE => You Ok?
HARVEY => Yes. Yes, I am.
HARVEY => You wanna get out of here?
KATE => Sure.
KATE => I don't think I've stayed up all night since I was a student.
HARVEY => You got sad. Why?
KATE => Oh, I don't know. My uniform's green?
KATE => I was pregnant once.  I didn't have it. Didn't give it a moment's thought.  That's what smart girls did.
KATE => I do sometimes wonder what they'd be like today.  Whether they'd be smart. Funny. Serious.  I don't know, it's silly.
KATE => I don't know why i just told you that.
HARVEY => No.  I'm glad.
HARVEY => Meet me here, tomorrow.
KATE => What?
HARVEY => Exactly here, at these chairs. At noon.
KATE => What about your flight, Harvey?
HARVEY => I don't want to leave.  Guess why.
KATE => Why?
HARVEY => I wanna be with you.
KATE => Shut up, Harvey.
HARVEY => It's true.
KATE => You say that now, but wait until tomorrow.
HARVEY => Today is tomorrow.
KATE => Harvey we know nothing about each other. You're...
HARVEY => Old?
KATE => A bit older, yes.  I can be mean. Really mean.
HARVEY => So can I.
KATE => No. Truly cantankerous.
HARVEY => So can I.
KATE =>  I should be going.
HARVEY => I know enough to know, I'll be here. Waiting, at this chair.
KATE => Sure, Harvey.
HARVEY => Noon. I mean it.  I'll be here.
KATE => Ok.
HARVEY => Wait.
HARVEY =>  Sorry.
KATE => Harvey Shine.
HARVEY => Can I have something until tomorrow.
KATE =>  I must go.
HARVEY => Morning.
CONCIERGE => I'm afraid they're both out of order, Sir.
HARVEY => I guess i'll walk, then.
HARVEY => Shit.
PORTER => Sir, are you Ok?
HARVEY => I've got to go. I've got to be somewhere.
DOCTOR => Sir, I need you to stay calm. It looks to me like Arrhythmia - an irregular heart-beat.
HARVEY => Yes, S.V.T'S, that's what I've been trying to tell the nurse. I've had it since I was a kid. I take Primax. I guess i've been forgetting to take it recently. I've been under alot of stress, that's all.
DOCTOR => Well Ok, then we probably know where we're at. But I need to check all possibilities.
HARVEY => I know it's Arrhythmia! Please, I have to be there.
DOCTOR => Sir, I'm 99% sure it is. But my job is to make sure it's not that 1%. I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't check out absolutely everything.  Nurse, we'll do an EKG, followed by Bloods. And can you arranfe a monitored bed for him for tonight.
KATE =>  Ok mum, that's me, I'm done.
MAGGIE => Why don't you stay and have some lunch?
KATE => I can't, I've got to go.  Not to pry or anything but why is there a large smoked ham under the stairs?
MAGGIE => Oh, that, yes...It's, um...The neighbour gave it to me.
KATE => The polish neighbour?  So probably not a mass murderer.
MAGGIE => Probably not.
MAGGIE => Are you sure you're going to be alright?
KATE => Of course I will. I'll be fine.
MAGGIE => Men, who needs them. Remember we've got Greece to look forward to.
KATE => Yeah.
PADDY => Morning Kate.
KATE => Morning Paddy.
PADDY => Looking lovely as ever.
KATE =>  Thank you.
HARVEY => It's some sort of Statistics Agency.  Yes. That sounds right. Yes, based out at Heathrow.  Thank you. Hold on.  Miss, could I borrow, your pen.
HARVEY => Thanks, thanks alot.
OONAGH => O.N.S., Heathrow branch.  Hold on. 
OONAGH =>  Kate it's for you. Some guy called Harvey.
OONAGH => Um, I'm sorry. She's not here.
HARVEY => Please. It's important.
OONAGH => Hold on.
OONAGH => I'm sorry, she's busy.  She won't come.
RECEPTIONIST => If I could just get you to sign these, you'll be all done.
RECEPTIONIST => And there.  And that's it.
HARVEY => Hello?
MARVIN => Hey Harvey, it's Marvin. Where are you?
HARVEY =>  Oh, I'm still in London, Marvin.
MARVIN => Well you get yourself back here my friend. I've got some great news. You were right. The Samuelson account. None of the kids could handle it. They couldn't nail it. They ended up picking one of your old tunes. They want you to come back and update it.  We need you back, Harvey. Your old room's here waiting for you.  Harvey?
HARVEY => Well, that's great Marvin.
MARVIN => Yeah. Yeah, `it's great'. I mean, look, I know when to eat humble pie. So look, hey, when can you get back here?  Harvey?
HARVEY => I...I'm not coming back.
MARVIN => What?
HARVEY => I'm quitting Marvin.
MARVIN => What you mean you quit? Harvey, fuck you man, you need us.
HARVEY => No, you know, I don't. As you said, it's my `last chance'.  Look, I gotta go.
HARVEY =>  Taxi!
HARVEY => Heathrow please. As quick as you can.
HARVEY => Excuse me, I'm looking for a Kate. Kate Walker.
AGGIE => Who wants to know?
HARVEY => A friend.  More than a friend.
AGGIE => There's a man here looking for Kate, says he's `more than a friend.'
OONAGH => More than a friend?!
OONAGH => You're the American.  She likes you. I can tell.  Now, don't you go messing her around. Don't you hurt her.
HARVEY => I wouldn't. I won't.
OONAGH => She's not here.
HARVEY => Oh.
OONAGH => She's left for the day.  But you might find her at her class.  I think it starts around now. Down on the Southbank. At the National.
HARVEY => Yes, I know.
OONAGH => Oh you do, do you?  Well, go on. Go get her.
HARVEY => Thank you.
MIKE => The blood oozes from his wound like dark chocolate on a warm summer's day.
KATE => Hey.
HARVEY => Hey.
KATE => You're still here - still in London...
HARVEY => Yeah.  Kate, I just wanted to apologise and explain...
KATE => No, you don't have to - explain - it's fine -
HARVEY => No, but I do -
KATE => I don't need to hear - it's fine, seriously.
HARVEY => But I want to...  I had to go to Hospital.
KATE => Oh, God! Why?!
HARVEY => No, it's nothing, I'm fine, I just forgot to take my pills. I have this condition, I've had it since I was a kid - it's an irregular heart- beat sort of thing.
KATE => Arrythmia.
HARVEY => Yes! How do you know what it is?
KATE =>  My...My father has it.
HARVEY =>  Well, young men get it too.
HARVEY => Kate, I'm so sorry I wasn't there.
KATE => Harvey, I like you, I really do. And I had a lovely time - it was great. But, you know, I don't really do fountains at noon.  I live in Willesden. And you live - in -
HARVEY => White Plains.
KATE => Exactly. And we're not teenagers, so - you know, monday morning and life kicks in, all that jobs and family and brown envelopes with bills in - it was a lovely day and I won't forget it, but it's not exactly real life...
HARVEY => It is. It can be.
KATE => No, Harvey, it's not.
HARVEY => Kate, I want this. I want you.
KATE => But it's not just about you, is it?  You don't know anything about me. Look at me. It's pathetic. I expected you not to show for God's sake. I think I even wanted you not to be there, it's easier that way.  You - you just dive in wherever, deep end, whoosh. But, I'm not your bloody swimming pool Harvey.  
KATE => And I am not going to do it, I'm not going to do it because it will hurt. Not right now, maybe, but soon - there will be a "it's not quite working is it" or a "I need some space" or whatever it is and it'll end and it'll hurt and I won't do it, I won't and...I...Oh fuck, I don't want to cry. I don't want this...
KATE => I think it's actually easier for me to be disappointed. I think I'm actually angry at you for trying to take that away.
KATE =>  Mum, I love you, but not now.
HARVEY => Should I take that as a hopeful sign?
HARVEY => If you just give me a little wider smile.
KATE =>  Oh, shut up, Harvey.
KATE => So how's this going to work, Mr Shine?
HARVEY => I have absolutely no idea...  But it will.  I promise you that.
KATE => Shall we walk?
HARVEY => Yes.
KATE => That's better.
HARVEY => I think you're my kinda girl.
HARVEY => Why don't you ask me those questions?
KATE => Which ones?
HARVEY => You know, from the airport. When I wouldn't stop.
KATE => Oh, the questionnaire.  Ok. Name?
HARVEY => Harvey Shine.
KATE => Place of residence?
HARVEY => I'm in transition.
