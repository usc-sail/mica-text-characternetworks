ARNIE => My beer is Rheingold the dry beer... Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...
ARNIE => It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real frosty treat, won't you try, won't you buy Rheingold beer...
ARNIE => Stuck tighter'n dogshit in a deep freeze!
ARNIE => Hot damn! Now... a little oil...
ARNIE => It's not bitter, not sweet... it's a big fuckin' treat...
ARNIE => My beer is Rheingold the dry beer... Think of Rheingold whenever you fry beer...
ARNIE => Oh n-
WEREWOLF => My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...
WEREWOLF => Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...
JANE => This place is Tarker's Mills, where I grew up... and this is how it was when I was fourteen - a place where people cared about each other as much as they cared about themselves. This is how my town looked as, all unknowing, it approached the rim of the nightmare. The killing had begun.
JANE => The killing had begun, but at first no one knew it. Arnie Westrum was a chronic drunk, and what happened seemed like an accident.
JANE => The county coroner concluded that Arnie passed out on the tracks. There wasn't enough evidence to conclude anything else.
JOE HALLER => I'd like to give you Father Lester Lowe, of Holy Family Catholic Church!
JANE => I'm going out for a while, 'kay?
NAN => All right. Stay close. And make sure your brother's all right.
LOWE => For the last ten years...
GIRL => "Make sure your brother's all right."
JANE => Marty's a booger.
BOB => Just pretend you're in your own church askin' for money, father! It'll work fine!
LOWE => For the last ten years, I have had a dream. A dream of a time when modern medical care would come to this small community, which sometimes seems so far from Durham, with her lifesaving hospitals. I hope that this meeting, at which I see so many of my friends gathered, will be the start of making my dream come true.
MARTY => Holy...! Brady, are you sure they're not poisonous?
BRADY => Little old blacksnake? Hell, no!
MARTY => Lemme hold him!
JANE => I was almost fifteen that summer. My brother Marty was eleven. Marty and his friend Brady Kincaid were the crosses I had to bear. Brady was actually the worse of the two, but I was rarely disposed to see that. Not when my younger brother was so constantly thrown in my face by my parents.
LOWE => $32,000 is a lot of money. But when you think of the lives this unit might save, it seems very inexpensive indeed.
BRADY => I got an idea.
MARTY => What?
MARTY => You wouldn't.
MARTY => You would.
LOWE => An endeavor like this seems to me to be the very definition of community - all of us pulling together as one, farmers and merchants... Protestants and Catholics...
BRADY => Jane... Jane...
MARTY => It was just a blacksnake, Jane-
JANE => Look at my knees! Look at my dress! I hate you!
BRADY => Did wittle Janie make wee-wee in her teddies?
MARTY => Stop it, Brady.
BRADY => Ooooh, naughty!
MARTY => Jane, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. We didn't mean-
JANE => Oh, no! You never mean to! I hate you, you booger!
BRADY => Really got her goat that time.
MARTY => Oh, shut up, Brady. You're warped.
STELLA RANDOLPH => Wait! Don't go!
MAN => Just leave me alone!
STELLA => Please! You have to help me!
DECEIVER => It's your oven, but it ain't my bun you're baking in there. Sorry, babe.
JANE => Stella? Is that you?
STELLA => Who - ?
JANE => It's Jane, Stella. Jane Coslaw.
JANE => What's wrong?
STELLA => He's going away. I know he is.
JANE => Who's going away?
STELLA => What am I going to tell my mother? If he won't marry me, what am I going to tell my mother?
JANE => Stella, I don't know what-
STELLA => Oh, leave me alone! Just leave me alone, you stupid thing!
O'BANION => Let us pray.
O'BANION => May the Grace of God shine upon those gathered here... and lift them up... and grant success to the endeavor to which they have so openheartedly declared their support. Amen.
NAN => I want you two to bury the hatchet. You're being very silly, Jane.
JANE => Did you see my knees?
MARTY => Jane, I-
NAN => I think you're being mean as well as silly. Your brother has never had a scraped knee in his whole life.
JANE => You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
MARTY => Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
JANE => Brady's a booger and so are you!
NAN => Jane Coslaw!
BOB => Stop it or I'll throw the whole bunch of you out!
BOB => That's where poor old Arnie Westrum pitched his last drunk.
BOB => They had to pick up what was left of him in a peach basket.
JANE => Oh, Daddy! Gross!
MARTY => Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
JANE => If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
NAN => You're not going to vomit, Jane. And I think we've all had quite enough of this horror-movie talk.
MARTY => Janey?... Are you awake?
MARTY => Can I come in?
JANE => What's the money for?
MARTY => A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
JANE => I don't want your money. You're a booger.
MARTY => It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
JANE => I can get a pair of L'Eggs down at the pharmacy for a dollar forty-nine. Here.
MARTY => That's for you, too. Uncle Al gave it to me-
JANE => That drunk!
MARTY => -but I want you to have it.
MARTY => Yeah, go ahead.
JANE => You booger!
MARTY => It really is for your birthday, though - try it on Brady. He'll wet his pants.
JANE => Go to hell!
MARTY => I love you, Janey.
STELLA => Suicides go to hell. Especially if they're pregnant. And I don't even care.
MOTHER => Oh my dear God... Stella!
MOTHER => Stella!...Stella!
JOE HALLER => Okay...yes...Oh, fuck off!
PETE => What'd they say, Joe?
HALLER => They said they'd be here by noon.
PETE => Maybe it wasn't such a good idea telling that Smokey Bear from the Detective Division to fuck off, Joe.
HALLER => I waited until he hung up. Jesus, what a mess. I wish I'd stayed in the army. Let's go on out there.
BRADY => Look out! Look out! It's Madman Marty and the Silver Bullet!
BRADY => You glad to be back in jail, Marty?
MARTY => Sure - I like school.
TAMMY => You booger.
MARTY => That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
BRADY => I gotta split - see ya, Marty... Tammy.
bike. => MARTY pushes in a hand clutch and moves a small lever. He bumps down over the curb and they cross the street side by side, TAMMY on her bike, MARTY in his wheelchair.
MARTY => Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
TAMMY => What's that?
MARTY => Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
TAMMY => For getting a divorce?
MARTY => Well... it is his third.
TAMMY => Thanks for coming with me, Marty- I was scared to go past her house by myself.
MARTY => Yeah... it is a little scary.
TAMMY => I mean, I saw her. All the time.
TAMMY => I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
MARTY => Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
TAMMY => There's something else scary.
MARTY => What?
TAMMY => That.
TAMMY => I've been hearing noises in there.
MARTY => What kind of noises?
TAMMY => Rattling. Rustling.
MARTY => Rats...
TAMMY => And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
MILT => Tammy, you get on in here and do some dishes!
TAMMY => I've got to go.
MARTY => I'd go out and take a look myself, but I think the Bullet'd get stuck in the garden. It looks sorta greasy.
TAMMY => You would, wouldn't you?
MARTY => Sure. No sweat.
TAMMY => Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
MARTY => Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
TAMMY => Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
MARTY => Jeez!
MARTY => I'm always doing this! I gotta go, Tammy.
MILT => TAMMY!
TAMMY => Coming Daddy!  Bye... thanks again for coming home with me.
MILT => 'Bout time. Why you want to hang around that cripple?
TAMMY => I like him.
MILT => Goddamn cripples always end up on welfare. Ought to electrocute all of 'em. Balance the fucking budget.
MARTY => Come on, baby-
VIRGIL => Well, Marty! I see you lucked out again!
MARTY => Yep. Would you fill it up, please, Mr. Cutts?
VIRGIL => Want me to check the oil?
MARTY => Sure!
VIRGIL => Wipe the windshield an check the driver's bullshit level?
UNCLE AL => I'll see your Carlton Fiske and raise you a George Brett... a Dave Kingman... and a Rod Carew.
MARTY => Okay, okay. I call.
UNCLE AL => Wait a minute, wait a minute!
UNCLE AL => Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
MARTY => Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
UNCLE AL => Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
NAN => Come on, Marty- bedtime.
MARTY => Mom-!
UNCLE AL => Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
NAN => Make it quick.
UNCLE AL => Three kings.
MARTY => I got a straight to the queen!
UNCLE AL => Bullshit luck!
NAN => That's enough!
MARTY => Aww, Mom-!
NAN => I don't want you drinking around Marty. That's too much. If you can't stop it, you better stay away.
UNCLE AL => I come here because Marty needs a friend.
NAN => Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
UNCLE AL => Another wonderful time at Sister Nan's house! Heeyyy!
MARTY => Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
JANE => What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
MARTY => Stop it!
BOB COSLAW => Hey! That you, Marty?
JANE => He's okay, Dad!
JANE => Marty, are you all right?
MARTY => Yes. Go away.
JANE => Let me help you up.
NAN => Marty?
NAN => Jane, have you been teasing your brother again?
MARTY => She wasn't, Mom- I dropped my toothbrush and fell over when I tried to get it. Jane helped pick me up.
MARTY => Jane's wunnnderful.
JANE => Here. Brush them good, Marty. Some of that shit in your head might leak down into your mouth and poison you.
NAN => Jane Coslaw!
MILT => Give him the airplane! Wring his neck!
MILT => Give him the sleeper, you fuckin bugwit!
MILT => Let's see if you want to come back and break my pots all to shit after I put some rock salt in your asses!
MILT => Who's there?
MRS. STURMFULLER => Tammy, where's your father?
in. => d.) ANDY FAIRTON, in the sporting-goods store, checks an automatic pistol and then holsters it on his hip. He has a pugnacious, unpleasant look. e.) BILLY McCLAREN turns the sign on the door of his barber shop from OPEN to CLOSED, looks out warily at the street (to make sure there are no psycho killers out there for trims, I guess), then leaves and locks the door behind him. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS him down a couple of store fronts to Owen's, where he also goes in. f.) The paper rack in front of Peltzer's Drug/ The "Press-Herald" headline is a sixteen-pointer: MANIAC CLAIMS SECOND VICTIM.
ELMER => Don't tell me an animal can't rip a man up the way Milt Sturmfuller was ripped up!
VIRGIL => But the woman's bed was ripped right down the middle, Elmer- it's take a chainsaw to do something like that!
PORTER => Damn straight!
ELMER => Shut up, Porter.  What about the tracks?
VIRGIL => That could be something to throw off the cops. And it ain't animals that try to confues the law; it's people do that.
ANDY FAIRTON => Law around here don't need much confusing.
ANDY => Joe Haller couldn't find his own ass if someone rammed it full of radium and gave him a Geiger counter.
PETE SYLVESTER => Could be I know a fella who's still PO'd over getting fined two hundred bucks for that little fender bender out on the Ridge Road last year.
ANDY => Could be I know a fat old fella who ought to take care of his mouth before someone comes along and turns it inside out. I pay Joe Haller's salary to keep the people in this town safe, and he ain't doing it.
BILLY => Last town report said you was in arrears your taxes, Andy. Guess you must have paid up, huh?
ANDY => What are you, trying to be smart?
OWEN => You guys turn down the thermostat or I'm gonna turn you all out. Now who's drinking?
ANDY => Bring me a Schlitz.
MARTY => Here it comes!
BRADY => Drop it!
JANE => Marty Coslaw, you get down out of that tree!
MARTY => Push the Bullet over, Jane, okay?
JANE => Supper was an hour ago, Dumbo.
MARTY => Oh, Jeez! I forgot! Is she mad?
JANE => They both are. At me, for not getting you sooner. I ought to let you fall.
MARTY => Hey, Brady! You coming?
BRADY => In a while!
JANE => Come on, Marty.
ANDY => This whole investigation has been as efficient as a Polish fire drill! It-
PETE => I've heard enough out of you, Andy. If you don't shut your mouth, I'm going to shut it for you.
ANDY => What did you say?
OWEN => Jesus wept.
PETE => You heard what I said, motormouth.
HERB => Has anyone in here seen my son Brady?
HERB => Brady!
HERB => Get out of my way!
JOE HALLER => Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women...
HALLER => ...and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb. Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now...now...
HALLER => Stay off the bandstand, Herb.
HERB => Is it my boy? Is it Brady?
HALLER => Don't go up-
HERB => Brady! Brady!
HERB => Br-
PETE => Joe, is it-
HALLER => Shhh.
PETE => Is it the Kicaid b-
HALLER => Shhh, I said.
ANDY => What the fuck is going on h-
HERB => We'll bury his shoes.
HERB => That's what we'll have to do; we'll bury his shoes. Maybe in a couple of Roi-Tan cigar boxes.
HERB => We'll bury his shoes because his feet are still in them and they're the only part of him that makes sense anymore.
HERB => It's gonna be the cheapest funeral this town ever saw!
JANE => My mother and father- my mother in particular- did not much care for Uncle Al...
JANE => ...but when it came to such unpleasant duties as taking Marty to the funeral of his best friend...
JANE => ...they didn't at all mind drafting him. As to the sort of comfort Uncle Al may have been able to offer him...
JANE => ...I now believe that was best kept between the two of them...
JANE => ...or among the three of them.
LOWE => Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon. There will be a requiem mass for Brady Kincaid this Sunday. They did ask me to say a word of comfort to you, if I could.
LOWE => If there is any word of comfort I can give you, it's just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the time of the beast always passes.
LOWE => If there are times when we feel alone and afraid, only small creatures in the dark, then these are the times when we must turn to one another for our comfort and our hope. To our neighbors. To our community. To our love for each other. I alone cannot ease the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can I ease your pain, nor you ease mine. But if I believe anything it's this: we can comfort each other. We can heal each other. We can go on together.
LOWE => The Bible tells us not to fear the terror that creepeth by night or that which flieth by noonday, and yet we do... we do. Because there is much we don't know, and we feel very small. But we must not be alone. We must not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is the wide gate to the hell of terror. Turn to each other. Join hands in your sorrow and try to remember that the face of the beast always becomes known.  The time of the beast always passes.  Let us pray.
UNCLE AL => You all right, Marty?
MARTY => Yeah.
UNCLE AL => There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
MARTY => No.
UNCLE AL => Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
MARTY => Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
UNCLE AL => Huh?
MARTY => What if it's some kind of monster?
UNCLE AL => Jesus, Marty! Come off it!
MARTY => What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
UNCLE AL => A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
MARTY => Tammy said she'd been hearing noises in that greenhouse. Growling noises, like a big animal. Her father was killed that night.
UNCLE AL => Marty, you have to get this idea out of your head. Psychotics are more active when the moon is full, and this guy is a psycho. He's going to turn out to be as human as you or me.  In a manner of speaking. Now let's get you inside.
ANDY FAIRTON => Okay, you all know what group you're in and what area you'll be covering, right?
PORTER ZINNEMAN => Damn straight!
ELMER ZINNEMAN => Shut up, Porter.
ANDY => Groups one through four are in the woods north of the Sturmfuller place. Five and six west of Carson Creek.
ANDY => Moonrise at 8:52 p.m.
ANDY => If he comes out to stroll in the moonlight tonight, we're going to get the sorry sucker.
PORTER => Damn straight!
ELMER => Shut up, Porter.
ANDY => Just remember, it's the psycho we want, not each other. So look before you-
HALLER => I want all of you folks to go home!
HALLER => I can't remember deputizing a single one of you!
ANDY => That's right, Joe- the only deputy you got is that fat shitbag beside you, and neither one of you has done a damn thing about solving this case.
HALLER => We'll catch him.
ANDY => You couldn't catch a cold.
HALLER => The law has a name for what you men are planning. It's private justice, and private justice is about a step and a half away from lynch mobs and hang ropes. I'm no J. Edgar Hoover, but I am the law in Tarker's Mills, and I want you men to go home.
ANDY => Don't let this guy scare you! What's he done since this thing started but hang his face out?
ANDY => He ain't got so much as a fingerprint!
OWEN KNOPFLER => Ah, shut up, Andy.
ANDY => Don't tell me to-
HERB => Yes. Correct. Shut up.
HERB => I just came from my boy's funeral.
HALLER => Herb...I know how upset- how grief-stricken you must be...but-
HERB => He was torn apart.
HALLER => Yes. Yes, but-
HERB => Upset, you say. Grief-stricken, you say. Constable, you don't know what those words mean. My son was torn to pieces. To pieces!
HERB => My son was torn to pieces!  You come in here and talk to these men about private justice. You dare to do that. Constable Haller, why don't you go out to Harmony Hill and dig up what's left of Brady and explain to him about private justice. Would you want to do that?
HERB => No. I thought not.  You folks stay here if you want. I wouldn't ask anyone to do anything that runs counter to his conscience. As for me... I'm going out and hunt up a little private justice.
LOWE => Billy... Billy, this is a bad idea. Joe can...
BILLY => Joe's had his chance, Father. Leave me be.
HALLER => Let them go.
LOWE => But-
HALLER => This is that spirit of community you were talking about. Grand, ain't it? Maybe they'll shoot a hitchhiker or something and Andy can mount the head and raffle it off. To benefit the Medcu van, of course.
LOWE => But can't we do anything?
HALLER => Sure. We can pray to Christ that none of them get killed.
ANDY => Well, it's about frigging time! They'll have his hide tacked to somebody's barn door before we get out there!
ELMER => Help me Porter, goddammit!
ELMER => Don't pull me! You want to rip the right cheek of my ass right off?
PORTER => Well, Elmer, there are folks that'd say you've been half-assed most of your-
ELMER => Are you going to unhook me or be a wise guy?
VIRGIL => Jesus, that was close. Uh, pardon me, Rev'runt.
O'BANION => Come on. Be careful.
VIRGIL => Rev'runt! What is it?
O'BANION => My foot! My foot!
O'BANION => Get it off me! Get it off me!
VIRGIL => Sure...okay...
ANDY => It came from over there.
BOBBY ROBERTSON => As far as I could tell, it could have come from anywhere.
ANDY => We'll spread out in a skirmish line. If the bastard tries to go around us, we'll hear him.
BOBBY => I dunno-
MAGGIE => I think Bobby Robertson here's making lemonade in his pants. That lemonade got ice cubes in it, Bobby?
OWEN => Let off him, Maggie. I'm scared, too.
BOBBY => I ain't scared! Let's go!
ANDY => Okay. Spread out on me. Five feet apart.
BILLY McCLAREN => Where's it coming from? Other side?
BOBBY => No- it's behind us. I told you you couldn't trust-
ASPINALL => It isn't on either side.
ANDY => What are you-
ASPINALL => It's under the fog. It's right in with us.
BOBBY => I can't move. Christ Jesus, I can't move!
ASPINALL => I think we better start backing up, Andy. Real slow. Real-
WEREWOLF => "Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!"
WEREWOLF => "Real slow! Real slow!"
WEREWOLF => "Real slow! Real slow! Real slow!"
OWEN => Come on, then! You want to rock and roll with me?
WEREWOLF => "REEEEEL SLOW!"
MAGGIE => Look at it! Holy God, Andy, look at that thing!
ANDY => I don't want to look at it.
OWEN => Come on, come on! You want to do the bop? I'll bop you, motherfucker! Come on!
OWEN => Come on, you bastard!
WEREWOLF => Bringing in the sheaves... bringing in the sheaves... we shall come rejoicing... bringing in the sheaves...
LOWE => Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon. They did ask me to say a word of comfort to you if I could.
HERB => There is no comfort, Father. Only private justice.
LOWE => Uh, if there's any word of comfort I can give you, it's just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the time-
LOWE => The time... the time of the beast always passes. There are answers... ways... ways to... to cope... if we turn to each other...
HERB => Father-
HERB => It tore out his heart.
LOWE => No!
CONGREGATION => Sowing in the morning/sowing seeds of kindness/sowing in the noontide/and the dewy eve...
CONGREGATION => My beer is Rheingold the dry beer... Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...
REV. LOWE => No! No! No!
CONGREGATION => It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real frosty treat...
CONGREGATION => ...Rheiinngold beer!
LOWE => Let it end, dear Lord. Let it end. Please let it end.
HALLER => Anne Sturmfuller and her little girl.
PETE => Yeah... but what are they doing?
HALLER => Putting on my Sherlock Holmes deerstalker cap, I deduce that they are leaving.
HALLER => She's not the only one. Lot of people leaving town. And I guess if we want a beer, we'll have to drink it at home.
PETE => Joe, what's wrong with you? I ain't never seen you like this.
HALLER => I lost my guts.
PETE => Bullshit.
HALLER => It was the Kincaid boy. I looked at him... and I felt it happen. It was no big deal. No worse than pissing down your own leg. You ever do that? Maybe when you were real scared?
HALLER => One minute I had me some guts- as much as the next man, anyhow- and then, poof. Gone.
PETE => Joe... you are going to feel better than this. This... this feeling of yours... it's gonna pass...
JOE => Is it?
MARTY => It's not fair.
JANE => Look out, world! Marty the Great didn't get something he wanted!
NAN COSLAW => Stop it, Jane.
JANE => Well, I don't see why everybody just about breaks down and cries whenever he-
BOB => Stop it, your mother said.
MARTY => It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
UNCLE AL => And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
MARTY => Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
UNCLE AL => It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
MARTY => Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL => I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
MARTY => Don't call me dear boy.
UNCLE AL => But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
UNCLE AL => Look at this.
UNCLE AL => This is gonna turn your wheelchair into a fucking F-14, Marty-
UNCLE AL => Your mom's not around, is she?
MARTY => She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
UNCLE AL => Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
UNCLE AL => The guy killed your best friend, drove your girl out of town, and stole the second-best holiday in the year. Have I got it right?
MARTY => You got it right, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL => Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
MARTY => What?
UNCLE AL => Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
UNCLE AL => All is cool, Marty-boy. Go for it.
UNCLE AL => Gun it.
UNCLE AL => Jesus! Not too much!
MARTY => Wow.
UNCLE AL => You got a pilot's license, Marty?
MARTY => Do I need one?
UNCLE AL => We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
UNCLE AL => The kid's dead meat. What have I done?  Put a rock in it, Marty!
UNCLE AL => You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
MARTY => It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL => It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
MARTY => I don't get you.
UNCLE AL => I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
MARTY => Sure.
UNCLE AL => Good.
UNCLE AL => I've got to go, Nan- I had a wonderful time.
NAN => So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
UNCLE AL => See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
MARTY => Okay.
UNCLE AL => Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
MARTY => Yeah! What is it?
UNCLE AL => You're gonna have the Fourth of July in October, Marty. Just don't blow your head off.  And remember that it isn't just the fireworks. It's because no crazy shithead should be able to stop the good guys, if you can dig that.
MARTY => I can dig it- thank you, Uncle Al! Thank you!
UNCLE AL => Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
MARTY => Yeah, I know. It's great!
UNCLE AL => One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
MARTY => Yeah... sure.
UNCLE AL => Save this one for last.
MARTY => What is it?
UNCLE AL => A tracer. You'll like it.
MARTY => Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
UNCLE AL => You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
UNCLE AL => Have a good time, dear boy! And watch out for the werewolves!
MARTY => Shit!
MARTY => All right!
MARTY => Here's one for the good guys!
MARTY => All right!
MARTY => Is someone there?
MARTY => Who's there?
time. => He can't; to do that he'd need at least one more hand. He puts the tube of the tracer between his teeth and tries again.
MARTY => Oh, please...
WEREWOLF => Bastard Marty! Bastard Marty! Kill you! Reeeal slow!
UNCLE AL => 'Lo? Go away.
MARTY => It's a werewolf! I saw it! Last night-
UNCLE AL => You dreamed it, Marty.
MARTY => No! I went out late last night- and-
UNCLE AL => There are no such things as werewolves. Please, dear boy, have some pity.
GIRL => Whowuzzit?
UNCLE AL => Obscene phone caller. Go back to sleep.
JANE => Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
MARTY => Where's Mom?
JANE => Went shopping. Why?
MARTY => Jane, I have to talk to you.
JANE => About what?
MARTY => I need you to help me. Uncle Al won't believe me, and if you won't help me, I... I...
JANE => Marty, what is it?
JANE => He told me something that was clearly unbelievable... and yet, somehow I believed most of it. And I understood one thing with total clarity: Marty himself believed it all.
MRS. THAYER => Jane?
JANE => I'm collecting returnable bottles and cans for the Medcu Drive, Missus Thayer- I just wondered if you had any.
MR. THAYER => Who is it?
MRS. THAYER => Jane Coslaw.
JANE => Hi, Mr. Thayer.
MR. THAYER => Hello, Jane.
MRS. THAYER => Bring your cart around to the back, Jane- we'll look in the garage.
JANE => Thank you.
JANE => Uncle Al hadn't believed him, but Uncle Al was thirty-five that summer and I was fourteen... at fourteen you can still believe the unbelievable, although even then that ability is growing rusty, is preparing to squeal to a stop.
JANE => Hi, Father Lowe!
LOWE => Top of the morning to you, Jane Coslaw!
JANE => I'm going to bring in a monster load of bottles in an hour or so!
LOWE => That's great, Jane... I'll be waiting.
JANE => Marty had seen where the tracer had struck home, he said, and I went out that day doing more than just looking for returnable cans and bottles- I was looking for a man- or woman- with only one eye.
BILLY => I know what you're after, Jane, and you're out of luck. Little Toby Whittislaw was in yesterday, and I gave 'em all to him.
JANE => Oh... okay.
JANE => That you, Mr. Fairton?
ANDY FAIRTON => No- it's Ronald McDonald. I came in for a shave and a burger.
JANE => Got any bottles, Mr. Fairton?
ANDY => No!
JANE => Oh... okay.
JANE => 'Bye, Mr. McClaren.
BILLY => 'Bye, Jane.
ANDY => Jesus!
JANE => Father Lowe! I'm ready to turn in my bottles and cans!
JANE => Father?
LOWE => Take your cart around to the garage and unload, Jane! Then bring me your tally sheet!
JANE => Okay!
JANE => Father Lowe?
JANE => Father Lowe?... I've got my tally sheet...
LOWE => Very good, Jane!
LOWE => Good, Jane. Very... very good.
LOWE => Jane! You're trembling!
JANE => I... I don't feel so well, I guess maybe I got too much sun.
LOWE => Would you like to come in the parlor and lie down for a bit? Or have a cold drink? I have some soda-
JANE => No!  That is, I have to get home and help my mom with lunch.
LOWE => I'll give you a ride!
JANE => No- she... she was going to meet me at the market. I'll be fine.
LOWE => Give my best to your brother, Jane.
JANE => I will.
LOWE => Real slow.
MARTY => Oh, Jeez! What did you do then?
JANE => I ran faster than I ever ran in my life- what do you think, dummox? By the time I got back here, I really thought I was going to faint.  What are we going to do, Marty? If we tried to tell anybody- grown-ups, I mean- they'd laugh. What are we going to do?
MARTY => I think I know.
JANE => I mailed another letter for Marty the next day... a third the day after that. Then, on Saturday...
JANE => ...we told Uncle Al what we'd been up to. His reaction was less than serene.
UNCLE AL => Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
JANE => Uncle Al-
UNCLE AL => From him I'd expect it. I sometimes think his common sense got paralyzed along with his legs. But you, Jane! You! Little Polly Practical!
JANE => You don't understand.
UNCLE AL => Oh, I understand plenty! I understand that my niece and nephew are sending the local Catholic priest little love notes suggesting that he gargle with a broken light bulb or eat a rat-poison omelet!
MARTY => It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
UNCLE AL => I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
MARTY => Was it a prescription?
UNCLE AL => What the hell does that matter?
MARTY => It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
UNCLE AL => Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
MARTY => Well... was it a prescription?
UNCLE AL => I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
MARTY => What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
UNCLE AL => You want to know what I think?
MARTY => No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
UNCLE AL => Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
JANE => It was not! You want me to show you! Come on! I'm not afraid! I'll show you right now!
UNCLE AL => No thank you, Jane. I'm a little old for palying the Hardy Boys Meet the Catholic Werewolf.
MARTY => Never mind, Jane. He'll have gotten rid of it by now anyway.
JANE => If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
UNCLE AL => I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
JANE => Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
UNCLE AL => Well... he probably did. I mean, he could make a complaint without taking an ad out in the paper, couldn't he?
MARTY => I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
UNCLE AL => Marty, do you see your suspect?
MARTY => Yes, I see him.
UNCLE AL => Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
MARTY => I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
UNCLE AL => When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
JANE => I don't know exactly what I believe. But I know that what I saw was a baseball bat and not a broomstick. I know there was something strange about the way the house smelled that day. It smelled like an animal's den. And I believe in Marty. I mean- there are times when he makes me so mad I could kill him, but I still believe in him.  You used to believe in him, too, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL => Kids!
LOWE => Little bastard.
OUTFIELDER => You comin' down to Robertson's for a soda, Marty?
MARTY => No- I guess I'll go home.
OUTFIELDER => Okay- seeya!
MARTY => Yeah... seeya.
LOWE => Bastard.
LOWE => Oh, you bastard!
MARTY => Come on, baby... come on...
LOWE => Marty...
LOWE => I'm very sorry about this. I don't know if you believe that or not, but it's true. I would never willingly hurt a child. You should have left me alone, Marty.
LOWE => I can't kill myself, Marty. You see, our religion teaches that suicide is the greatest sin a man or a woman can commit. Stella Randolph was going to commit suicide; if she had done so, she would be burning in hell right now. By killing her I took her physical life but saved her life eternal. You see, Marty? You see how all things serve the will and the mind of God? You see, you meddling little shit!
LOWE => You're going to have a terrible accident, Marty. You're going to fall into the river.
MARTY => Mr. Zinneman! Mr. Zinneman!
MARTY => I ran out of gas.
ELMER => Spooky in there, ennit?
MARTY => It sure is!
UNCLE AL => Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
MARTY => I told you!
UNCLE AL => Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
JANE => Did you talk to the constable?
UNCLE AL => After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did. He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
MARTY => I told you!
JANE => Shut up, Marty.
UNCLE AL => There's something else.
MARTY                    JANE => What is it?                    What other thing?
UNCLE AL => I probably shouldn't tell you- you're both hysterical on the subject. I'm starting to feel like a guy handing out free Arthur Murray coupons to victims of the dancing sickness.
MARTY => Uncle Al, if you don't tell me-
UNCLE AL => I went out to that rest area.
MARTY => You found the tracer?
UNCLE AL => No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
MARTY => There! You see!
UNCLE AL => It could have been anything, Marty.
MARTY => What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
UNCLE AL => No.
UNCLE AL => Lowe's car-?
JANE => Blue. This blue.
UNCLE AL => Jesus.
HALLER => That's just about the craziest damn story I've ever heard, Al.
UNCLE AL => I know. I could have edited out all of the completely crazy stuff, but I thought you deserved to hear it with the bark on.
HALLER => I appreciate that. Now, the next question: Do you believe any of this? You do, don't you?
UNCLE AL => Let's just say I believe Lester Lowe should be checked out.
HALLER => That can be arranged.
MARTY => Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
UNCLE AL => And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
MARTY => I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
UNCLE AL => You're not going to let it go, are you?
MARTY => I saw what I saw.
UNCLE AL => Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
JANE => In the made-up stories, the guy who's the werewolf only changes when the moon is full. But maybe he's really that way almost all the time, only as the moon gets fuller...
MARTY => ...the guy gets wolfier.
JANE => Here. Take mine, too.
MARTY => Jane... you don't have to do that.
JANE => Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
MARTY => Will you marry me, Jane?
UNCLE AL => Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
JANE => I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
MARTY => No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
UNCLE AL => The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
MARTY => I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
UNCLE AL => Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
MARTY => Will you do it?
MARTY => Please, Uncle Al.
JANE => Will you?
UNCLE AL => All right. I give up. Yes.
MARTY                            JANE => All right! Thanks!                Thank you, Uncle Al!
UNCLE AL => If either of you ever tells anyone I even bought a piece of this story, werewolves will be the least of your problems.
JANE => Uncle Al's friend Mac was more than a gunsmith; he was, Uncle Al said, an old-world craftsman, a sort of wizard of weapons.
JANE => God knows what sort of story my uncle told him, but I think that for men who have been married as often as Uncle Al, invention on short notice becomes something of a specialty.
JANE => The gunsmith confirmed the high-grade silver content of my crucifix and Marty's medallion...
JANE => ...melted them down...
JANE => ...and molded them into a silver bullet.
MAC => Here it is.
MAC => Nicest piece of work I ever did, I think. It's got a low-grain load so it won't tumble. Should be pretty accurate.
UNCLE AL => It's just a gag, that's all. What would you shoot a silver .22 bullet at, anyway?
MAC => How about a werewolf?  Happy Halloween, Al.
JANE => By the time Marty's silver bullet was done, it was Halloween... and the full moon had come around again. Earlier that afternoon, my grandfather, who had been dying of cancer for over seven years, finally finished the job.
NAN => Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
UNCLE AL => -and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
NAN => And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
UNCLE AL => We won't!
NAN => You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
UNCLE AL => If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
NAN => I will- be good, kids.
MARTY                            JANE => 'Bye, mom! Bye, dad!                We will! 'Bye!
UNCLE AL => Can I tell you kids something?
JANE => Sure, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL => When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
MARTY => Yeah? Really?
UNCLE AL => Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
BOB => I can't believe that you'd agree to leave the kids with him. A year ago I would have laughed at the idea. You used to almost breathe fire when Al came in the house.
NAN => He's changed. Just this summer. Or something's changed him. Marty, maybe. And the drinking- I think it's almost stopped. Whatever it is, it's wonderful. And they'll be safe with him. I'm sure of it.
BOB => I know they'll be safe with him... but will he get them both into bed by nine-thirty?
NAN => If I told him to, he will.
ANNOUNCER => This concludes WDML's broadcast day.
JANE => You'll burn yourself up sometime doing that, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL => I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
MARTY => But Uncle Al! You said-
UNCLE AL => I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
JANE => The moon's not down yet...
UNCLE AL => Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
MARTY => What if I say no?
UNCLE AL => Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy. Go on, now.
MARTY => If that'd gone off, it would have been the end of our silver bullet.
UNCLE AL => See, dear boy? Totally unimpaired.
JANE => It's him! It's the werewolf! I see him! IT'S THE WEREWOLF!
UNCLE AL => You see it, Marty!
MARTY => I was looking at you...
UNCLE AL => A very familiar feeling is beginning to creep over me.
MARTY => What's that, Uncle Al?
UNCLE AL => I feel like a horse's ass.
JANE => I saw it, Uncle Al! I did!
JANE => Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
MARTY => Jane-
UNCLE AL => Would you kids go to bed? My head's starting to ache.
WEREWOLF => Reeeal slow...
MARTY => It's here! It's outside!
UNCLE AL => Jane, it's just a power fai-
MARTY => Get the gun!
MARTY => Janey! The gun! THE GUN!
WEREWOLF => Maa-aaa-rty...
WEREWOLF => Maaa-aaa-rty...
JANE => Don't you hurt him! Don't you hurt my brother!
WEREWOLF => Reeeal slow, Maa-aaarty-
WEREWOLF => Bastard Marty!
WEREWOLF => Kill you...
WEREWOLF => Bastard Marty!
UNCLE AL => You okay, Janey?
JANE => I'm all right... but Marty! Ma-
MARTY => I'm all right. He's dead.
UNCLE AL => There. I told you there weren't any such things as werewolves.
JANE => Are you sure it's dead? Or him? Or whatever it is?
UNCLE AL => If it isn't now, it will be after I pound one of your mother's silver candlesticks through its heart.
JANE => Oh Uncle Al, no!
UNCLE AL => Oh yes, Janey. When I believe something, I believe it all the way.
JANE => Are you all right, Marty?
MARTY => All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
JANE => You're a real booger, you know it?
MARTY => I love you, Jane.
JANE => It wasn't always easy for me to answer that... but I could answer it that night, and I find I can say it now that the terrible events of that fall have receded to memories which seem little more than dreams in my mind.
JANE => I love you, Marty.
JANE => I love you, Marty... good night.
