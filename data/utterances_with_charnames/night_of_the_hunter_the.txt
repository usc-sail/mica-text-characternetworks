VOICE => Beware of false prophets...
VOICE => ...which come to you in sheep's clothing...
VOICE => ...but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
"IT" => What's wrong?
"IT" =>  Heyy! (then he shouts to all and to us) Heyy!
VOICE => Ye shall know them by their fruits.
VOICE => A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit...
VOICE => Neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
VOICE => Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
PREACHER => What's it to be, Lord, another widow? Has it been six? Twelve?... I disremember.
PREACHER => You say the word, and I'm on my way.
PREACHER => You always send me money to go forth and preach your Word.
PREACHER => I am tired. Sometimes I wonder if you really understand.  Not that you mind the killin's...
PREACHER => Yore Book is full of killin's.
PREACHER => But there are things you do hate, Lord: perfume-smellin' things -- lacy things -- things with curly hair --
PREACHER => No, there are too many of them; you can't kill a world.
TROOPER => You driving an Essex tourin'-car with a Moundsville license?
JUDGE => Harry Powell, for the theft of that touring car you will spend thirty days in the Moundsville Penitentiary.
PREACHER =>  Preacher Harry Powell.
JUDGE => A car thief! Picked up where you were! A man of God?  Harry Powell.
PEARL HARPER => Stand still, Miss Jenny!
JOHN HARPER =>  There! What's so hard about that!
PEARL HARPER =>  Daddy!
BEN HARPER => Where's your Mom?
JOHN HARPER => Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
BEN HARPER => Listen to me John.
BEN HARPER =>  Listen! This money here! We got to hide it before they get me! There's close to ten thousand dollars.  Under a rock in the smokehouse? Ah no. Under the bricks in the grape arbor? No, they'd dig for it.
BEN HARPER =>  Why sure! That's the place!
TROOPER =>  That's him.
2ND TROOPER =>  He prob'ly still has that gun.
BEN HARPER => Here they come.
JOHN HARPER => Dad, you're bleeding...
BEN HARPER => Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
JOHN HARPER => Yes, Dad.
BEN HARPER => You understand?
JOHN HARPER => Not even her?
BEN HARPER => You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
JOHN HARPER =>  I will guard Pearl with my life...
BEN HARPER => ..."and I won't never tell about the money."
JOHN HARPER => And I won't never tell about the money.
PEARL HARPER => You, Pearl. You swear too.
PEARL HARPER =>  Who's them Blue Men yonder?
JOHN HARPER =>  Blue men.
A TROOPER => Ben Harper!
BEN HARPER => I'm goin' now children. Goodbye.
TROOPER => Drop that gun, Harper. We don't want them kids hurt.
BEN HARPER => Just mind what you swore, son. Mind, boy!
JOHN HARPER =>  Don't!
JOHN HARPER =>  Don't!
JOHN HARPER => Dad!
JUDGE => Ben Harper, it is the sentence of this Court that for the murder of Ed Smiley and Corey South, you be hanged by the neck until you are dead, and may God have mercy on your soul.
BEN HARPER => I got you all buffaloed! You ain't never gonna git it outen me; not none o' you!
PREACHER =>  Where, Ben? Where? Where?
BEN HARPER =>  And a little child shall lead them.
PREACHER =>  Come on, boy: tell me.
PREACHER =>  Ben, I'm a Man of God.
BEN HARPER => Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
PREACHER => No, Ben.
BEN HARPER => What'd I say? (he grabs Preacher's throat and shakes him) What? What? What? What?
PREACHER =>  You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
BEN HARPER => Hm!
PREACHER =>  You killed two men, Ben Harper.
BEN HARPER => That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
PREACHER => With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
BEN HARPER => Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
PREACHER => Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
BEN HARPER => How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
PREACHER => I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
BEN HARPER => You, Preacher?
PREACHER => That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
BEN HARPER => What religion do you profess, Preacher?
PREACHER => The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
BEN HARPER =>  I'll bet.
PREACHER => Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
BEN HARPER =>  Keep talkin', Preacher.
PREACHER => If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
BEN HARPER => Keep talkin', Preacher.
PREACHER =>  You reckon the Lord wouldn't change his mind about you if...
PREACHER => Lord You sure knowed what You was doin' when You brung me to this very cell at this very time. A man with ten thousand dollars hid somewheres, and a widder in the makin'.
GUARD => Any trouble?
BART => No.
GUARD => He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
BART => He carried on some; kicked.
GUARD => He never told about the money.
BART =>  No.
GUARD => What do you figure he done with it?
BART =>  He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
BART'S WIFE =>  That you, Bart? Supper's waitin'.
BART =>  Mother: sometimes I think it might be better if I was to quit my job as guard.
WIFE =>  You're always this way when there's a hangin'. You never have to be there.
BART => Sometimes I wish I was back at the mine.
WIFE => And leave me a widow after another blast like the one in '24? Not on your life, old mister!
CHILDREN =>  Hing, hang, hung. See what the Hangman done!
CHILDREN =>  Hung, hang, hing! See the Robber swing!
CHILDREN =>  Hing, hang, hung! Now my song is done!
PEARL HARPER => Are you goin' to buy it, John?
MIZ CUNNINGHAM =>  Uh-Hawwww! (They glance toward her.)
MIZ CUNNINGHAM =>  So your Mommy's keepin' you out of school! Poor little lambs!
MIZ CUNNINGHAM => And how is your poor, poor mother?
JOHN HARPER => She's at Spoon's Ice Cream Parlor.
MIZ CUNNINGHAM =>  The Lord tends you both these days!
MIZ CUNNINGHAM =>  Didn't they never find out what your father done with all that money he stole?
MIZ CUNNINGHAM => When they caught him, there wasn't so much as a penny of it to be seen! Now what do you make of that! Eh, boy?
JOHN HARPER => Pearl and me, we have to go.
PEARL HARPER =>  Hing, hang, hung.
JOHN HARPER => You better not sing that song.
PEARL HARPER => Why?
JOHN HARPER => 'Cause you're too little.
PEARL HARPER => Can we get some candy?
JOHN HARPER => No.
WALT => Howdy, youngins.
ICEY SPOON => Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
WILLA HARPER => Icey, I don't want a husband.
ICEY SPOON =>  Fiddlesticks!
WALT =>  One solid brown sody, one Lovers' Delight.
ICEY SPOON => 'Tain't a matter of wantin' or not wantin'! You're no spring chicken, you're a grown woman with two little youngins; it's a man you need in the house, Willa Harper!
PEARL HARPER => Tell me a story, John.
JOHN HARPER => Once upon a time there was a rich king... (he sees the shadows on the wall and gets up and looks at them) ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
PEARL HARPER => The Blue Men?
JOHN HARPER =>  Just a man. (he climbs into bed and pulls up the covers) Goodnight Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
PEARL HARPER =>  'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
BIRDIE STEPTOE => She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. Come on in and have a cup of coffee.
JOHN HARPER =>  Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
BIRDIE STEPTOE => Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle Birdie's around.
BIRDIE =>  First day my jints is limber enough I'll haul her up and give her a good caulkin'.
BIRDIE STEPTOE => Ain't seen you in a coon's age, Johnny.
JOHN HARPER => I been mindin' Pearl.
BIRDIE STEPTOE => Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
BIRDIE STEPTOE => 'Scuse me, Cap, while I sweeten up my coffee.
BIRDIE =>  Dead and gone these twenty-five years and never takes her eyes off me.
BIRDIE STEPTOE =>  Man o' my years needs a little snort to get his boiler heated of a morning.
BIRDIE STEPTOE => This mornin' I was talkin' to this stranger up at the boarding-house. He knowed your Dad!
JOHN HARPER => Where did he know Dad?
BIRDIE STEPTOE => Well, boy, I'll not hide the truth; it was up at Moundsville Penitentiary.
JOHN HARPER => I got to go now, Uncle Birdie.
BIRDIE STEPTOE => Why shucks boy, you just got here.
JOHN HARPER =>  I told Mom I'd be back to Spoon's for Pearl.
ICEY SPOON =>  God works in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform.
PREACHER => I was with Brother Harper almost to the end;...
PREACHER =>  ...and now that I'm no longer employed by the Penitentiary it is my joy to bring this small comfort to his loved ones.
ICEY SPOON =>  It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
WALT => So you ain't with the State no more?
PREACHER => No, Brother; I resigned only yesterday. The heart-renderin' spectacle of them poor men was too much for me.
PREACHER => Ah, little lad, you're staring at my fingers.
PREACHER => Shall I tell you the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
PREACHER => H-A-T-E! (he thrusts up his left hand) It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low! L-O-V-E! (he thrusts up his right hand) See these here fingers, dear friends! These fingers has veins that lead straight to the soul of man! The right hand, friends! The hand of Love!
PREACHER =>  Now watch and I'll show you the Story of Life. The fingers of these hands, dear hearts! -- They're always a- tuggin' and a-warrin' one hand agin' t'other. (he locks his fingers and writhes them, crackling the joints) Look at 'em, dear hearts!
PREACHER =>  Old Left Hand Hate's a-fightin' and it looks like Old Right Hand Love's a goner!
PREACHER =>  But wait now! Hot dog! Love's a- winnin! Yessirree!
PREACHER => It's Love that won! Old Left Hand Hate's gone down for the count! (he crashes both hands onto the table)
ICEY SPOON => I never heard it better told. I wish every soul in this community could git the benefit. You jest got to stay for our church pick-nick Sunday!
PREACHER =>  I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
ICEY SPOON => You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
WILLA HARPER => John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
PREACHER => He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
JOHN HARPER => What did he tell you?
PREACHER => Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
JOHN HARPER => Is that all?
PREACHER => Why, no, boy; he told me lots and lots of things. Nice things, boy.
PREACHER => My, that fudge smells yummy!
ICEY SPOON =>  It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
ICEY SPOON => Don't he have the grandest singin' voice?
ICEY =>  John! Pearl!
ICEY SPOON => Run along and play, you two.
JOHN HARPER => Where?
ICEY SPOON => Down by the river. My goodness!
ICEY SPOON => That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
WILLA HARPER => It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
ICEY SPOON => If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
WILLA HARPER => John don't like him much.
ICEY SPOON => Pearl dotes on him.
WILLA HARPER => The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
ICEY SPOON => What he needs is a dose o' salts!
WILLA HARPER => There's something else.
ICEY SPOON => What?
WILLA HARPER => The money, Icey.
ICEY SPOON => I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
WILLA HARPER => I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
ICEY SPOON => You'll come right out and ask that Man of God!  Mr. Paow-well!  Clear that evil mud out of your soul!
ICEY SPOON =>  John! Pearl!
ICEY SPOON =>  Come along hee-ere and get some fuu- udge!
JOHN HARPER =>  I don't want no fudge.
ICEY SPOON =>  You'll do what you're told!
ICEY SPOON => You go set down by the River.
WILLA HARPER =>  Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
ICEY SPOON => Get along with you.
ICEY SPOON => You!!!
ICEY SPOON => That young lady'd better look sharp or some smart sister between here and Captina's a-gonna snap him up right from under her nose! (they nod and agree, ad lib) She's not the only fish in the river! (more agreement. John and Pearl join Icey. Icey speaks to John) Now you two stay put!
ICEY SPOON =>  Shilly-shallying around...
ICEY SPOON =>  A husband's one piece of store goods ye never know till you get it home and take the paper off.
WILLA HARPER =>  Did Ben Harper ever tell you what he done with that money he stole?
PREACHER => My dear child, don't you know?
ICEY SPOON => She's moonin' about Ben Harper. That wasn't love, it was just flapdoodle. (agreeing nods and murmurs) Have some fudge, lambs. (she hands some down to John and Pearl. Pearl smears her mouth with it; John, watching always towards his mother, takes one nibble and throws the rest away) When you're married forty years, you know all that don't amount to a hill o'beans! I been married to my Walt that long, and I'll swear in all that time I'd just lie there thinking about my canning.
WILLA =>  John! John?
ICEY SPOON => A woman's a fool to marry for that. It's something for a man. The good Lord never meant for a decent woman to want that -- not really want it! It's all just a fake and a pipe-dream.
WILLA HARPER => John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
PREACHER => Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
PREACHER => That money's at the bottom of the river wrapped around a 12-pound cobblestone.
WILLA HARPER => Thank you, Harry.
PEARL HARPER => John...
JOHN HARPER => Sshhh...
WILLA HARPER => I feel clean now! My whole body's just a quiverin' with cleanness!
PREACHER => John: here.
PREACHER => Your tie's crooked.
BIRDIE STEPTOE =>  'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
JOHN HARPER =>  When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
BIRDIE STEPTOE => Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
JOHN HARPER =>  When'll the skiff be ready?
BIRDIE STEPTOE =>  And the times that are gone by. I'll have her ready inside of a week; and then we'll go fishin'. How's your Maw?
JOHN HARPER => O, she's all right.
BIRDIE STEPTOE => How's your sister Pearl?
JOHN HARPER => Just fine.
BIRDIE STEPTOE => Leavin', boy?
JOHN HARPER => Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
BIRDIE STEPTOE => Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
BIRDIE STEPTOE => And mind now -- I'll have your Paw's skiff in ship-shape, 'side of a week.
JOHN HARPER =>  Is somebody there?
JOHN HARPER =>  Is anybody here?
PREACHER =>  Good evening, John.
PREACHER => I had a little talk with your mother tonight, John; and your mother decided it might be best for me to -- let you know the news.
PREACHER => Your mother told me tonight she wanted me to be a daddy to you and your sister. We're going to get married, son.
PREACHER => Did you hear what I said, son?
JOHN HARPER => Huh?
PREACHER => Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
JOHN HARPER =>  You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
PREACHER =>  -- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
JOHN HARPER =>  You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
PREACHER =>  Tell me what, boy?
JOHN HARPER => Nothin'!
PREACHER => Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
JOHN HARPER => No. No.
PREACHER => No matter, boy, we've got a long time together.
ICEY SPOON =>  Wave yer hands! Great sakes!
ICEY SPOON =>  You wait here while I get your night- things.
PEARL HARPER => Now can I tell?
JOHN HARPER => Hm?
PEARL HARPER => When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
JOHN HARPER => You swore, Pearl!
PEARL HARPER =>  John! Don't!
JOHN HARPER => You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
PEARL HARPER => I love Mr. Powell lots and lots, John.
JOHN HARPER => Don't you tell! Don't you NEVER DARE tell!
WILLA HARPER =>  Oh! It's... uh...
WILLA HARPER =>  Harry...
PREACHER => Fix that window shade.
WILLA HARPER =>  Harry!
PREACHER =>  I was praying.
WILLA HARPER => Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
PREACHER => You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
WILLA HARPER => No, Harry! I thought --
PREACHER => I think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven.
PREACHER =>  Get up, Willa.
WILLA HARPER => Harry, what --
PREACHER => Get up.
PREACHER => Now go and look at yourself yonder in that mirror.
PREACHER => Do as I say.
PREACHER => LOOK at yourself.
PREACHER => What do you see, girl?
PREACHER => You see the body of a woman! The temple of creation and motherhood. You see the flesh of Eve that Man since Adam has profaned. That body was meant for begetting children. It was not meant for the lust of men.
PREACHER => Do you want more children, Willa?
WILLA HARPER => I -- no, I --
PREACHER => It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
WILLA HARPER => Yes.
PREACHER => You can get back into bed now and stop shivering.
WILLA HARPER =>  Help me to get clean so I can be what Harry wants me to be.
VOICES =>  AAA-MEN!
CONGREGATION => AAA-MENN!
WILLA HARPER =>  You have all sinned!
CONGREGATION => Yes! Yes!
WILLA HARPER => But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
WILLA HARPER =>  And he slew two human beings and he come to me and he said: Take this money and buy your per-fumes and paint!
WILLA HARPER => But Brethren, that's where the Lord stepped in! That's where the LORD stepped in!
PREACHER => Yes!
CONGREGATION =>  Yes! Yes!
WILLA HARPER =>  And the Lord told that man --
CONGREGATION => Yes! Yes!
WILLA HARPER => The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
CONGREGATION =>  Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
WILLA HARPER => Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
CONGREGATION =>  IN THE RIIV-ER!
PEARL HARPER => Now! You're John -- and you're Pearl.
JOHN =>  Pearl?... Pearl?
PEARL HARPER => You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
JOHN HARPER => You what?
JOHN HARPER =>  Pearl! You ain't --
PEARL HARPER => John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
PEARL HARPER =>  It's all here.
JOHN HARPER => Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
PREACHER =>  John?
JOHN HARPER => Oh -- yes?
PREACHER => What are you doing, boy?
JOHN HARPER => Getting Pearl to bed. I --
PREACHER => What's taking you so long about it?
JOHN HARPER =>  It -- she --
PREACHER => What's that you're playing with, boy?
JOHN HARPER => Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
PREACHER => Come on, children!
PREACHER => Now, up to bed with the both of you.
PREACHER => Come here, John. Run along, Pearl.
PREACHER => Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
JOHN HARPER =>  Yes. Yes.
PREACHER => That wasn't very nice of you, John. Have a heart, boy.
PREACHER => Run along to bed.
WILLA HARPER => Were you impudent to Mr. Powell, John?
JOHN HARPER => Mom, I didn't mean --
WILLA HARPER => What were you impudent about?
JOHN HARPER => He asked me about the money again, Mom.
WILLA HARPER => You always make up that lie, John! There is no money, John. Can't you get that through your head?
BIRDIE STEPTOE => Meanest, orneriest, sneakinest critter in the whole river, boy! A gar!
JOHN HARPER => Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
BIRDIE STEPTOE => There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
JOHN HARPER => Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
BIRDIE STEPTOE => Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
BIRDIE STEPTOE => Do you mind me cussin', boy?
JOHN HARPER => No.
BIRDIE STEPTOE => Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
BIRDIE STEPTOE => Never was much of a one for preachers myself. I dunno what's wrong up at your place, but just remember one thing, Cap -- if ever you need help you just holler out and come a- runnin'. Old Uncle Birdie's your friend.
BIRDIE STEPTOE => There! You slimy, snag-toothed, egg- suckin', bait-stealin' so-and-so!
BIRDIE STEPTOE =>  Mind what I told you. If ever you get in a crack, I just come a-runnin'.
JOHN HARPER => Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?
BIRDIE STEPTOE => If you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
JOHN HARPER => I don't know.
PREACHER =>  She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
JOHN HARPER => I don't know nothin'!
PREACHER => The summer is young yet, little lad. (he turns away from John) Pearl?
PREACHER => John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
PEARL HARPER => Mm-hm.
PREACHER => I'll tell you a secret.
PEARL HARPER => Yes?
PREACHER => I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
PEARL HARPER => Yes?
PREACHER => Now it's your turn.
PEARL HARPER => What secret shall I tell?
PREACHER => How old are you?
PEARL HARPER => That's no secret. I'm five.
PREACHER => Sure, that's no secret.
PREACHER =>  What's your name?
PEARL HARPER =>  You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
PREACHER => Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
JOHN HARPER =>  You swore you wouldn't tell! (he beats the air with his fists) You swore! You swore! You swore!
PEARL HARPER =>  You hit Daddy with the hairbrush!
PREACHER =>  You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
PEARL HARPER => Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
PREACHER => John's just plumb bad through and through --
PEARL HARPER =>  Yes, John's just plumb bad.
WILLA HARPER => That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
ICEY SPOON => It's a shame!
WILLA HARPER => Goodnight.
ICEY SPOON => Goodnight, honey.
ICEY SPOON =>  Plan on a longer visit next time.
WALT =>  You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
WILLA HARPER =>  I'm needed to keep peace and harmony between them.  It's my burden and I'm proud of it, Icey!
PEARL HARPER =>  John's bad.
PREACHER =>  Yes; John's bad.
PEARL HARPER => Tell me another secret about my Dad.
PREACHER =>  O no! Your turn!
PEARL HARPER => All right.
PREACHER => Where's the money hid.
PEARL HARPER => John's bad.
PREACHER => Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
PREACHER =>  I didn't expect you home so soon.
WALT => Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
ICEY SPOON => How do you mean?
WALT => I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
ICEY SPOON => Say what, Walt Spoon!
WALT => There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
ICEY SPOON => About what!
WALT => About Mr. Powell. All of it!
ICEY SPOON => Walt!
WALT => Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
ICEY SPOON => May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
WALT => Mother, I only --
PREACHER =>  Are you through praying?
WILLA HARPER => I'm through, Harry.
PREACHER => You were listening outside the parlor window.
WILLA HARPER => It's not in the river, is it Harry?
PREACHER => Answer me!
WILLA HARPER => Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
WILLA HARPER =>  Then the children know where it is hid? John knows? Is that it?  Then it's still here, somewhere amongst us, tainting us?
WILLA HARPER => So you must have known it all along, Harry.
WILLA HARPER => But that ain't why you married me, Harry. I know that much. It couldn't be that because the Lord just wouldn't let it.
WILLA HARPER => He made you marry me so's you could show me the Way and the Life and the Salvation of my soul! Ain't that so, Harry?
WILLA HARPER => So you might say it was the money that brung us together.
WILLA HARPER => The rest of it don't matter, Harry.
WILLA HARPER => Bless us all!
ICEY SPOON =>  Walt! Come quick!
WALT =>  What's wrong, Mother?
ICEY SPOON =>  Sshhh! He's in there.
WALT => Who?
ICEY SPOON =>  Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
WALT => I'll be switched!...
WALT => Just went?
ICEY SPOON => She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
WALT => Is he hit pretty bad?
ICEY SPOON => All to pieces!
WALT => There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
ICEY SPOON => A man of the Cloth?
ICEY SPOON => Walt Spoon, that's for sickness in the house!
WALT => What can we do, Mother?
ICEY SPOON => I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
WALT => Mister Powell?
PREACHER =>  A strange woman is a narrow pit!
ICEY SPOON =>  Amen! Amen!
PREACHER => She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
PREACHER => My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
ICEY SPOON =>  Mister Powell!
WALT => Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
PREACHER => It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
ICEY SPOON => What could have possessed that girl!
PREACHER =>  Satan.
ICEY SPOON => Ah.
WALT => Didn't you have no inkling?
PREACHER => Yes; from the first night.
WALT => The first night?
PREACHER => Our honeymoon.
WALT => How's that?
PREACHER => She turned me out of the bed.
ICEY SPOON =>  Nnnoooo!!
WALT => What do you figure to do?
PREACHER => Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
ICEY SPOON =>  Mmmmm!
WALT => That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
PREACHER => I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
WALT => Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
PREACHER => A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
PREACHER => I burned it. (Preacher holds out his hand, stares in disgust, and wipes his palm dramatically on his coatsleeve) I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
ICEY SPOON => Amen.
PREACHER => The pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends.
WALT => She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
PREACHER => She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
WALT => Maybe she's just run off on a spree.
PREACHER =>  No!
WALT => Well, there's no harm in hopin'.
PREACHER => Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
ICEY SPOON =>  How?
PREACHER => She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
ICEY SPOON =>  What!
PREACHER => She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  She was drinking.
PREACHER => I tried to save her.
ICEY SPOON => I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
PREACHER => The devil wins sometimes!
PREACHER =>  Can't nobody say I didn't do my best to save her!
PREACHER =>  Leaning! Leaning! Safe and secure from all alarms!
PREACHER => Leaning! Leaning! Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!  Children!
PREACHER =>  Chill-dren?
PEARL HARPER => John, why do we have to hide?
JOHN HARPER => Careful...
PEARL HARPER => Where's Mom?
JOHN HARPER => She's gone to Moundsville.
PEARL HARPER => To see Dad?
JOHN HARPER => Yes, I reckon that's it.
PREACHER =>  Children!
JOHN HARPER => Someone is after us, Pearl.
PEARL HARPER => I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
JOHN HARPER => Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
PEARL HARPER => Why?
JOHN HARPER => If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
PEARL HARPER => Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
JOHN HARPER => No, that's just it. No.
PEARL HARPER => Where are we goin', John?
JOHN HARPER => Somewheres. I don't know yet.
PEARL HARPER => I'm hungry, John.
JOHN HARPER => We'll steal somethin' to eat.
PEARL HARPER => It'll spoil our supper.
PREACHER =>  Pearl?
PREACHER => I hear you whisperin', children, so I know you're down there. I can feel myself gettin' awful mad, children.
PEARL HARPER =>  John...
PREACHER => My patience has run out, children. I'm comin' to find you now.
ICEY SPOON =>  Yoo-Hooooo! Mis-ter Paow-welll!
ICEY => Just a little hot supper I fixed for you and the children.
PREACHER => Bless you, bless you!
ICEY => And how are the children?
PREACHER => They're down there playin' games in the cellar and they won't mind me when I call 'em. I'm at my wit's end, Miz Spoon.
ICEY =>  John: Pearl:
ICEY SPOON => John! Pearl! Shake a leg! (she claps her hands sharply)
ICEY SPOON =>  I won't have you worryin' poor Mister Powell another minute!
ICEY SPOON => Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
ICEY SPOON => Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
PREACHER => Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.
ICEY => Don't be too hard on 'em, Reverend. Poor motherless children.
ICEY SPOON => Remember now Mister Powell, don't be afraid to call on us. Good night.
PREACHER =>  Good night Miz Spoon, and thank you again.
PREACHER => Weren't you afraid, my little lambs, down there in all that dark?
BIRDIE STEPTOE => They'll think it was me! They'll think it was old Uncle Birdie!
BIRDIE STEPTOE => If you'd o' seen it, Bess! I'm drunk as a lord and I know it, but...
BIRDIE =>  Sweet Heaven, if you'd o' seen it!
BIRDIE STEPTOE =>  Down there in the deep place... her hair wavin' lazy and soft like meadow grass under flood waters and that slit in her throat just like she had an extry mouth.
BIRDIE =>  And there ain't mortal human I can tell but you...
BIRDIE STEPTOE =>  ...Bess, for if I go to the Law they'll hang it on to me.
BIRDIE STEPTOE => Sweet Heaven save poor old Uncle Birdie!
PEARL HARPER =>  I'm hungry.
PREACHER => Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
PEARL HARPER => Can I have my supper please?
PREACHER => Naturally.
PEARL HARPER => Can I have milk too?
PREACHER => Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
PREACHER =>  About our secrets.
PEARL HARPER => No.
PREACHER => Why, pray tell?
PEARL HARPER => Because John said I mustn't.
PREACHER => NEVER -- MIND -- WHAT -- JOHN -- SAID!
PREACHER => John is a meddler. Stop sniveling. Looky here a minute!
PREACHER => Know what this is?
PREACHER => Want to see something cute? Looky now!
PREACHER => How about that! This is what I use on meddlers.
PREACHER => John might be a meddler.
PREACHER => NO -- no, my lamb. Don't touch it! Now don't touch my knife! That makes me mad. Very, very mad.
PREACHER => Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
PEARL HARPER =>  But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
PREACHER => JOHN -- DOESN'T -- MATTER! Can't I get that through your head, you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch!
PREACHER => There now! You made me lose my temper!
PREACHER => I'm sorry! I'm real sorry!
PREACHER =>  Now! Where's it hid, honey?
JOHN HARPER =>  I'll tell.
PREACHER =>  I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
JOHN HARPER =>  NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
PREACHER =>  Well I declare! Sometimes I think poor John will make it to heaven yet!
PREACHER => All right boy: where's the money?
JOHN HARPER => In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
PREACHER => It'll go hard, boy, if I find you're lyin'.
JOHN HARPER => I ain't lyin'. Go look for yourself.
PREACHER => All right... (he turns towards the door; then glances around) Come along.
JOHN HARPER => What?
PREACHER => Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
PREACHER =>  You don't reckon I'd leave you.
JOHN HARPER =>  Don't you believe me?
PREACHER =>  Why sure, boy, sure.
PREACHER => Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
JOHN HARPER => Yonder.
PREACHER =>  O no you don't!
PREACHER => Now: Where?
JOHN HARPER =>  Under the stone in the floor.
PREACHER => This is concrete.
PEARL HARPER => John made a Sin. John told a lie.
PREACHER => The Lord's a-talkin' to me now. He's a-sayin', "a liar is an abomination before mine eyes."
PREACHER => Speak, boy: Where's it hid? (the knife pricks the flesh under John's ear) Speak; before I cut your throat and leave you to drip like a hog hung up in butcherin' time!
JOHN HARPER => Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
PREACHER => You could save him, little bird.
PEARL HARPER =>  Inside my doll! Inside my doll!
PREACHER => In the doll! Why sure! Sure!
PREACHER =>  The last place anyone would look!
PREACHER =>  Chilll-dren?  The only reason I wanted that money is so's you could have it.
JOHN HARPER =>  The river. That's the only where! Uncle Birdie Steptoe!
PREACHER =>  Puhr-urrl? Want your Mommy back?  Want me to get her right now?
PEARL HARPER =>  John?
JOHN HARPER => Hush, Pearl. Come on.
PREACHER =>  OPEN THAT DOOR, YOU SPAWN OF THE DEVIL'S OWN STRUMPET!
JOHN HARPER =>  Uncle Birdie! Uncle Birdie!
JOHN HARPER => Uncle Birdie!
BIRDIE STEPTOE =>  Don't!
JOHN HARPER => Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!
JOHN HARPER => It's me! John Harper and Pearl! You said to come a-runnin' if we needed you!
BIRDIE STEPTOE =>  Johnny!
JOHN HARPER => Uncle -- Birdie! Oh -- please! Please wake up!
BIRDIE STEPTOE => I never done it, boy. Sweet Heaven I never done such a terrible thing! I'll swear on the Book to it, boy! I never done it! I never!
BIRDIE =>  Lord save poor old Uncle Birdie Steptoe that never hurt a fly! 
JOHN HARPER =>  There's still the river. -- The skiff is down by the willows.
JOHN HARPER =>  Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
PEARL HARPER =>  John, where are we g --
JOHN HARPER => Hush.
PREACHER =>  Children?
JOHN HARPER => Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
PEARL HARPER =>  That's Daddy!
PREACHER => Wait, you little whelps! Wait!
JOHN HARPER => Why can't I do it when I know how to do it!
PREACHER => Wait! Wait! I'll slit your guts!
PEARL HARPER => Once upon a time there was a pretty fly, and he had a wife, this pretty fly...
PEARL =>  ...and one day she flew away, and then one night his two pretty fly children...
PEARL =>  ...flew away too, into the sky, into the moon...
WALT =>  Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
ICEY SPOON => Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
WALT => Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
ICEY SPOON => You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
WALT => Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
JOHN HARPER => Ain't got none.
PREACHER =>  An ungrateful child is an abomination...
PREACHER =>  ...before the eyes of God. The world is fast going to damnation because of impudent youngins a-flyin' in the face of Age.
JOHN =>  They make soup out of them...
JOHN HARPER =>  ...but I wouldn't know how to go about gettin' him open.
JOHN HARPER => We're gonna spend a night on land.
PEARL HARPER => Are we goin' home, John?
JOHN HARPER => Ssh...
PREACHER =>  Leaning, Leaning...
PREACHER =>  ...safe and secure from all alarms;
PREACHER => Leaning...
PREACHER =>  Leaning; Leaning on the Everlasting Arms.
JOHN HARPER =>  Don't you never sleep?
JOHN HARPER =>  Pearl, wake up! Come on, Pearl!
RACHEL COOPER =>  You two youngsters get up here to me this instant!
RACHEL COOPER =>  Mind me now!
RACHEL COOPER =>  Now git on up to my house.
RACHEL COOPER => I'll git me a willow switch.

RACHEL COOPER => With the price o' pork what it is?
RACHEL COOPER =>  I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage. (she calls to children over her shoulder) You-all have your work cut out!
JOHN HARPER => She talks to herself.
CLARY => All the time.
JOHN HARPER => Your Maw's funny.
CLARY => She ain't our Maw. We just live at her house.
JOHN HARPER => Where's your folks?
CLARY => Some place.

WAITRESS => See ye Sunday, love!
RACHEL COOPER => Women is durn fools! All of 'em!
RACHEL COOPER =>  Take yer baskets in.
RACHEL COOPER =>  Looky there. (she indicates the lovers) She'll be losin' her mind to a tricky mouth and a full moon, and like as not I'll be saddled with the consequences.
RACHEL COOPER =>  Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
CLARY => She went.
RACHEL COOPER => John: you go fetch Ruby. (John goes. As Grocer empties baskets and tots up, Rachel continues:) Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
1ST LOAFER => How 'bout tonight, Ruby?
2ND LOAFER =>  What gives?
1ST LOAFER => The Old Lady's around.  How 'bout Thursday?

GROCER =>  Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
RACHEL COOPER =>  Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
RACHEL COOPER => Now old Pharoah, he was the King of Egyptland! And he had a daughter, and once upon a time  she was walkin' along the river bank and she seen somethin' bumpin' and scrapin' along down on a sandbar under the willows.
RACHEL COOPER =>  And do you know what it was, children?
PEARL HARPER => No!
RACHEL COOPER =>  Well, now, it was a skiff, washed up on the bar. And who do you reckon was in it?
RUBY =>  Pearl and John!
RACHEL COOPER =>  Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
RACHEL COOPER =>  It was Moses! -- A King of men, Moses, children. Now. Off to bed. Hurry.
RACHEL COOPER =>  John, git me an apple.
RACHEL COOPER => Git one for yourself, too.
RACHEL COOPER =>  John, where's your folks?
JOHN HARPER =>  Dead.
RACHEL COOPER => Dead. 
RACHEL COOPER => Where ye from?
JOHN HARPER => Up river.

JOHN HARPER => Tell me that story again.
RACHEL COOPER => Story, honey? Why, what story?
JOHN HARPER => About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
RACHEL COOPER => Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
JOHN HARPER => I mind you said there was two.
RACHEL COOPER => Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
RACHEL COOPER => Yes, come to think of it, there was two, John.
2ND LOAFER =>  Hey. Must be Thursday.
1ST LOAFER => Here we go.
PREACHER => You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
RUBY => Can I have this?
PREACHER => Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
RUBY => Will you buy me a choclit sody?
PREACHER => O' course.
LOAFERS => Watch out Preacher! Why, Preacher!
PREACHER =>  Shet yer dirty mouths!
RUBY => Ain't I purty?
PREACHER => Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
RUBY =>  No. No one never did.
PREACHER =>  There's two new ones over at your place, ain't there Ruby?
PREACHER => What's their names?
RUBY => Pearl and John.
PREACHER => Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
RUBY =>  Only she won't never let me play with it.
PREACHER => Ahh!
PREACHER =>  Yes!
RUBY => Did you ever see such purty eyes in all your born days?
2ND LOAFER =>  Don't let him git away, Sugar!
RUBY => He ain't like you-all! Next time I won't even ask him to buy me a sody!
RUBY => I been bad!
RACHEL COOPER => Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
RUBY => You'll whip me!

RACHEL COOPER => What you been up to?
RUBY => I been out with men.
RACHEL COOPER => Dear God, child!
RACHEL COOPER => You was lookin' for love, Ruby, the only foolish way you knowed how. (she lifts Ruby's face cheek to cheek beside her own) We all need love. Ruby, I lost the love of my son -- I've found it with you-all.
RACHEL COOPER => You must grow up to be a fine, full woman; and I'm goin' to see to it you do.
RUBY => This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
RACHEL COOPER => Now who was this?
RUBY => He never asked me for nothin'.
RACHEL COOPER => He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
RACHEL COOPER => What'd you all talk about?
RUBY => Pearl and John.
RACHEL COOPER => John and Pearl!
RACHEL COOPER => Is he their Pap?
RACHEL COOPER => Why hasn't he been to the house?
RUBY =>  Miz Cooper!

RACHEL COOPER => How'do.
PREACHER => You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
RACHEL COOPER =>  It's about that John and that Pearl?

RACHEL COOPER => Ruby, go fetch them kids.
PREACHER => Ah, dear Madam, I see you're looking at my hands!
PREACHER => Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
PREACHER =>  It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
RACHEL COOPER =>  Them kids is yours?
PREACHER =>  My flesh and blood!
RACHEL COOPER => Where's your Missus?
PREACHER => She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
RACHEL COOPER => Where's she at?
PREACHER => Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
RACHEL COOPER => She took them kids with her?
PREACHER => Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
RACHEL COOPER => Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
PREACHER => Are they well?
RACHEL COOPER => A sight better than they was.
PREACHER => Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
RACHEL COOPER => How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
PREACHER => The Lord will provide.
PREACHER =>  The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
RACHEL COOPER => What's wrong, John?
JOHN HARPER => Nothin'. 
PREACHER =>  Come to me, boy!
RACHEL COOPER => What's wrong, John?
PREACHER => Didn't you hear me, boy?
RACHEL COOPER => John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
JOHN HARPER => He ain't my Dad.
RACHEL COOPER => He ain't no Preacher neither. I've seen Preachers in my time, an' some of 'em was saints on earth. A few was crookeder'n a dog's hind leg, but this 'un's got 'em all beat for badness.
RACHEL COOPER => Just march yourself yonder to your horse, Mister.
RACHEL COOPER => March, Mister! I'm not foolin'.
PREACHER =>  You ain't done with Harry Powell yet! The Lord God Jehovah will guide my hand in vengeance! You devils! You Whores of Babylon! I'll come back when it's dark!
RACHEL COOPER => Moonin' around the house over that mad dog of a Preacher! Shame, Ruby!
RACHEL COOPER => Merciful Heaven!
RACHEL COOPER => Ruby, get the children out of bed. Bring them all down here to the kitchen.
RACHEL COOPER => Women is such fools!
RACHEL COOPER => It's a hard world for little things.
RACHEL COOPER =>  Children, I got lonesome. I figgered we might play games.
PEARL HARPER => Won't you tell us a story?
RACHEL COOPER => I might (a swift furious glance into the moonlight) I might tell a story.
CLARY => I'll light the lamp.
RACHEL COOPER => It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
RACHEL COOPER => Well... mind what I told you about little Jesus and his Ma and Pa and how there was No Room at the Inn?
RACHEL COOPER => Well now, there was this sneakin', no-'count, ornery King Herod!
RACHEL COOPER => And he heard tell of this little King Jesus growin' up and old Herod figgered: Well, shoot! There sure won't be no room for the both of us!  I'll just nip this in the bud.
RACHEL COOPER =>  Well, he never knowed for sure which one of all them babies of the land was King Jesus.
RACHEL COOPER => And so that cursed old King Herod figgered if he was to kill all the babies in the land, he'd be sure to get little Jesus.
RACHEL COOPER =>  And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
CLARY => They hid in a broom closet!
MARY => They hid under the porch!
JOHN HARPER => No; they went a-runnin'.
RACHEL COOPER => Well now, John, that's just what they done! They went a-runnin!
PREACHER =>  Figured I was gone, eh?
RACHEL COOPER =>  Run hide in the staircase! Run quick!
RACHEL COOPER =>  Ruby, git.
RACHEL COOPER =>  What do you want?
PREACHER =>  Them kids!
RACHEL COOPER =>  What are you after them for?
PREACHER =>  None of your business, Madam.
RACHEL COOPER => I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this kitchen shootin'!
RACHEL COOPER => Miz Booher? Rachel Cooper. Git them State Troopers out to my place. I done treed somep'n up in my barn.
JOHN HARPER => I'll see to Pearl.
RACHEL COOPER => I'll make coffee.
JOHN HARPER => She's all right.
RACHEL COOPER => John, you know? When you're little you have more endurance than God is ever to grant you again? Children are Man at his strongest. They abide.
A TROOPER =>  Is that him, Ma'am?
RACHEL COOPER =>  Yes! Mind where you shoot, boys! There's children here!
TROOPER => Whyn't you call us up before?
RACHEL COOPER => Didn't want yer big feet trackin' up my clean floors.
TROOPER =>  Harry Powell, you're under arrest for the murder of Willa Harper!
JOHN HARPER =>  Don't!
JOHN HARPER =>  Don't!
JOHN HARPER =>  Dad!
RACHEL COOPER => John! John!
JOHN HARPER => Here! Here! Take it back! I can't stand it, Dad! It's too much, Dad! I don't want it! I can't do it! Here! Here!
ICEY SPOON =>  Lynch him! Lynch him!
ICEY SPOON =>  Bluebeard!
WALT =>  Twenty-five wives!
ICEY SPOON => And he killed every last one of 'em!
ICEY SPOON =>  If the People of Marshall County...
LOAFERS =>  Bluebeard! Bluebeard!
LAWYER =>  Will you identify the prisoner?
LAWYER =>  Please, little lad. Won't you look yonder... (his pointing finger enters the shot. John shakes as if he had a cold) ...and tell the Court if that is the man who killed your mother?
LAWYER =>  It's all right, Mrs. Cooper. You can take the little fellow away.
LAWYER => Merry Christmas to you and yours, Mrs. Cooper.
LAWYER =>  And what's Santy Claus going to bring you, little man?
LAWYER =>  O-ho-oo-o!
ICEY SPOON =>  Them is the ones he sinned against, my friends!
LOAFER =>  Bluebeard! Bluebeard!
CROWD =>  Bluebeard! Bluebeard!
ICEY SPOON =>  Them's hers!
ICEY SPOON => Them's her orphans!
RACHEL COOPER => Where's Ruby?
CLARY => She went.
ICEY SPOON => Them poor little lambs!
ICEY SPOON => Them's the ones he sinned against, my friends!
CASHIER =>  Go out the back way, Miz Cooper.
CLARY => Ain't we goin' to the Bus Depot?
ICEY SPOON =>  Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
WALT =>  Come on!
ICEY SPOON =>  He lied!
WALT => Tricked us!
ICEY SPOON => He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
WALT => String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
ICEY SPOON => He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
OTHERS =>  Lynch him! String him up!
RUBY => I love him!
RUBY => He loves me because I'm so purty! You think he's like them others!
RUBY =>  You took on something awful about him buying me that there movie book. You was so mad you shot him and the blue men took him.
POLICEMAN =>  Hey Bart!
BART => Yeah?
POLICEMAN =>  We're savin' this bird up fer you!
BART => This time it'll be a privilege.
A VOICE =>  Bust the door down!
RUBY =>  They'll git him out. I'll git my things ready -- my shawl and my Mickey Mouse wristwatch that don't run and the straw hat with the flower, and we'll be married and live happily ever after!
VOICES =>  Bust the door down! Set fahr to it! Where's that axe! Climb up on the balcony! You six git 'round to the back!
ICEY SPOON =>  People of Marshall County!
RACHEL COOPER => Nothing!
RACHEL COOPER => I'm glad they didn't send me nothing! Whenever they do it's never nothing I want but something to show me how fancy and smart they've come up in the world.
MARY => Can we give you your presents now?
RACHEL COOPER => Shoot! You don't mean to say you got me a present!
RACHEL COOPER => Shoot now!
RACHEL COOPER =>  Why, Ruby!
RACHEL COOPER =>  A POT-HOLDER!
RACHEL COOPER =>  And much neater than last year's, Ruby! (Sound of tearing gift-paper o.s.)  And Clary! ANOTHER POT-HOLDER! Ain't that thoughtful. I'm always burnin' my hands.
RACHEL COOPER => And did you two make this together?
MARY => You hop us, some.
RACHEL COOPER =>  John, that's the richest gift a body could have.  You'll find your presents in the cupboard under the china-closet.
RACHEL COOPER => You know where, Ruby.
RACHEL COOPER => Ruby: (she takes a box from her apron pocket) This is yours.
RACHEL COOPER => Lord save little children!  You'd think the world would be ashamed to name such a day as Christmas for one of them...  ...and go on the same old way.  My soul is humble when I see the way little ones accept their lot.  Lord save little children! The wind blows and the rain is cold. Yet, they abide.
RACHEL COOPER =>  For every child, rich or poor there's a time of running through a dark place; and there's no word for a child's fear. A child sees a shadow on the wall, and sees a Tiger. And the old ones say, "There's no tiger; go to sleep." And when that child sleeps, it's a Tiger's sleep, and a Tiger's night, and a Tiger's breathing on the windowpane. Lord save little children!
RACHEL COOPER => That watch sure is a fine, loud ticker!
RACHEL COOPER => It'll be nice to have someone around the house who can give me the right time of day.
JOHN HARPER => This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
RACHEL COOPER => A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
JOHN HARPER => I ain't afraid no more! I got a watch that ticks! I got a watch that shines in the dark!
RACHEL COOPER =>  They abide and they endure.
