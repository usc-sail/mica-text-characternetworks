SOUTHERN MAN => Now these here are Brazilian, from Bahia. Deep cuts. Damn good. These is India, paler, but also good. And this is Columbia. From them limestone caves up in Muzo.
GRACE => Now them first two, you gonna get your money's worth.  This one here's more expensive, but that's 'cause there ain't a nigger flaw in one of 'em. They hard as steel and emerald green as emerald green fuckin' comes. Lookit that.
BUD => That's nice.
GRACE => That's the real McCoy. That's what that is.
BUD => Tell you what... Bag 'em all. The market's got a hard-on for this shit.
GRACE => I hear that.  Jake, get on it.
NEWSCASTER => ...And today, thirty-one year old Gary Plauche pleaded innocent by reason of insanity, to charges of second-degree murder in the slaying of accused sex offender, Jeffrey Doucett.
NEWSCASTER => ...District Court Judge Frank Salia, scheduled the trial one year to the day after Doucett was first arrested.
BUD => What do you got there? Diamonds?
GRACE => That's thirty grand. Out the door. You interested?
BUD => Ain't got the scratch right now. But I am interested.
NEWSCASTER => ...As a result of numerous threats made weeks ago, tight security surrounded the courthouse. However, missing from today's hearing, was the arresting officer.
NEWSCASTER => From East Baton Rouge Sheriff's office...
NEWSCASTER => ...Police Lieutenant, Bud Carter.
NEWSCASTER => Doucett was being extradited to Baton Rouge.
NEWSCASTER => The victim's father, Gary Plauche, stood waiting at the terminal. As Doucett walked by, Plauche turned, raised a handgun...and fired.
GRACE => Here you go. Fifteen three-karat blues. Wholesale. Twenty large.
NEWSCASTER => Lieutenant Carter was unavailable for comment.
RAY => Motherfucker, he's a cop.
SHEPARD => Fuck! Go! Go!
COBB => Think I broke a knuckle on that guy's tooth.
SHEPARD => He only had one tooth.
COBB => Well I got it, didn't I?
MARANDINO =>  Another round, Sherry.
SHERRY => Comin' up.
MARANDINO => Bud, we all supposed to be celebratin'. 'Been workin' this case for months. And you ain't said shit.
BUD => They had a lot of weight. Too much.
COBB => It's a ring. Organized burglary.
BUD => You saw them guys. You think that half ass crew was organized?
MARANDINO =>  They shit their pants in unison.
COBB => What are you gettin' after, Bud?
SHEPARD => You think it was someone else's score.
BUD => I think its a part of somethin' bigger.
BUD => Tomorrow morning we put our friends under the lamp. If they know this "someone else", we'll know him too.
RAY => I told you... I keep tellin' you... I don't know nothin'. That's it.
COBB => That's not it. We've been here all morning. We'll stay here all night.
MARANDINO => The stones you were fencin' belonged to an Amsec wall safe in "Kay's Jewelers". The rest from a vault in Bocage. Both owners can verify their belongings, and have.  Who you fencin' for?
GRACE => Man, I ain't sayin' fuckin' shit.
MARANDINO => Then your name's on a dozen other jobs, just like it.
GRACE => That's bullshit.
MARANDINO => No, that's a promise.
COBB => We got a series of burglaries in the area. All over the last six months. All still open. You don't talk, it's on you.
RAY => Well I ain't got nothin' to do with that.
COBB => Any idea who does?
RAY => No! Okay? Fuck no.
MARANDINO => ...Answer the question.
GRACE =>  MAN FUCK THIS! AND FUCK YOU! Y'ALL CREW'S JUST FAGGOTS IN MATCHING JACKETS!
BUD => Try this. I know you're too fuckin' dumb to be any more than a courier. I know you're coverin' for someone else. NOW TELL ME WHO THAT SOMEONE IS!
GRACE => I ain't a rat!
BUD => YOU AIN'T A RAT?!
MARANDINO => Easy, Bud. Go easy.
GRACE =>  STOP THIS SHIT! STOP HIM!
BUD => LOCK THE DOOR!
BUD => I'll teach you what commitment is... I'll throw you in an eight by nine and have you fucked in the ass by every inmate in the state of Louisiana-- AND THAT'S THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!
BUD => GIVE ME A NAME!
GRACE =>  He's from Whiskey Bay--!
BUD => --GIVE ME A NAME!!
BUD => Jesse Wheeler. Thirty-one.
BUD => Two tours in 'Nam. '69 and '71. He's a jump marine. Weapons trained, explosives.  Seven and a half out of a twelve year stint for federal robbery. Two in Angola. A year in DeQuincy. Three in El Reno with a transfer to Lewisburg. Then Marion with a brief stopover in Leavenworth. Released from Oxford, 1981.
SHEPARD => Jacket's the size of the bible.
BUD => His stay at Marion, they kept him in "H" block.
SHEPARD => H block? That's home to forty top murder one inmates...
BUD => Yeah, life sentences. Jesse only had twelve years.
BUD => He ain't just woodwork.
DISSOLVE TO => Night passes and the dawn arrives...
SHEPARD =>  Target's out.
BUD =>  Alright. Give him room.
BUD =>  We're mobile.
SHEPARD => He's turnin' off.
BUD => Let's take him in the car.  Wait'll he's stopped. Watch your backgrounds.
BUD => Don't move. You motherfuck, I'll blow your head clean off.
BUD => Shut the car off slowly.
SHEPARD => POLICE! WARRANT!
LYNN => GET OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE!
MARANDINO => MA'AM, CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN!
SHEPARD => WE GOT A WARRANT!
LYNN =>  FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!
LYNN => Help... My baby...my baby...
BUD =>  CALL AN AMBULANCE! NOW!
BUD => Toss everything.
COBB => Alright, I want everything seized!
MARANDINO => Motherfucker's got a general store.
SHEPARD => God damn...there's some weight.
BUD => I'm Detective Lieutenant Bud Carter, of the East Baton Rouge Parish Precinct.  So how you like Baton Rouge?
JESSE => What happened to my wife?
BUD => Water broke. She's en route to the hospital.
BUD => This is new.
BUD => What's the cyanide for, Jesse?
JESSE => Extracting impurities.
BUD => Impurities from what?
BUD => You're in a bad situation here, pal.
JESSE => I'll make bond.
SHEPARD =>  OUT! EVERYONE OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT!
BRADDOCK => What more do you want? You got a two time felon on multiple counts. You got robbery, B&E, you got an all-you-can-eat felony fuckin' possession. All on top of an organized burglary ring.
BRADDOCK => The man's in custody, Bud. Fucked for life. It's finished.
BUD => There's more, I know it.
BUD => Remember him? Ten months ago, a judge gets popped with a .357. Well I got a Ruger from Wheeler's toilet and rushed it through ballistics.
BRADDOCK => And?
BUD => It's a solid match! Dead on.
BRADDOCK => There's a dozen ways Wheeler could've got that burner. It don't prove a thing.
BUD =>  A stack of bonds taken from the home of a Baptist Minister...
BUD => Murdered. He and his wife. Looked like a robbery gone to shit then; I want it opened back up.
BUD => I still got tests pending. More guns. More cases. This guy ain't crazy, Mike. He's a ticket to somethin' big. Somethin' happening now.
BRADDOCK => So who's backin' him?
BUD => I don't know; I do know they'll post his bond. That's why I need a price they can't come up with overnight.
BUD => I'm right about this, Mike.  When a guy's lookin' at two hundred years and he ain't upset... It's like when your wife is accusing you of fuckin' the neighbor, but she don't know you're fuckin' her sister too. You're pretty calm about it, right?
BUD => It's 'cause we hit the wrong nerve. The guns, the other shit, the time... He can have that conversation. And he is. And he ain't upset. He's makin' eye contact, 'cause we're fallin' short.  This guy knows things. He knows where bodies are.
BRADDOCK => I'll bounce it up to the D.A.
JESSE => My name is Jesse Wheeler... I'm now in charge of this cell. Any y'all don't like it, step your black ass forward, line up.
BUD =>  Yeah...
MALE VOICE => Bud? Charlie Bowers.
BUD =>  Charlie... You had an inmate in '75, named Jesse Wheeler.
BUD => Charlie, you there?
CHARLIE => What's your interest in this guy, Bud?
BUD => Well, we got him on weapons and burglary. But I got a feelin' there's more.
CHARLIE => Damn straight, a lot more. Race riots. Smuggling. Extorting a guard. I had a few run-ins with him myself.
BUD => What else?
CHARLIE => You could say this is where he peaked.
CHARLIE => He's a white supremacist. The worst kind, if there is one.
CHARLIE => Came in on armed robbery and assault...
CHARLIE => But word in the system said, he's a contract killer for the Aryan Brotherhood.
CHARLIE => In here, the guy became an organizer...
CHARLIE => Controlling hits and movements inside the system. Prison to prison. State to state.
CHARLIE => Between the Aryan Brotherhood and Neo Nazis, he unified the front...
CHARLIE => All them prison gangs in the world... Black Panthers, Mexican Mafia, forget it. The AB is deadly as it gets. And Jesse Wheeler was their ring leader.
BUD => So what the fuck happened?
MURPHY => Processing ain't open till morning. We threw him in holding last night. 'Fore we even turn around, it's like we're back in the fuckin' Alamo.
BUD => He attack the guards?
MURPHY => Guards are fine. But he took on three niggers like they stole from him.
MURPHY => I'll tell you somethin', Bud. After it happened, our block was the quietest it'd ever been. Wish we had ten just like him.
BUD => Open the door.
BUD => Heard you refused a public defender.
BUD => At the gas station...When you were arrested, I put a gun to your head. You expected someone else.
JESSE => You don't look like cops.
BUD => And your house? Guns. Mass supply tells me, intent to sell. Cyanide in the fridge, explosives...tells me you're scared.
BUD => I know who you are.
JESSE => If you knew that much, you wouldn't be in here alone.
BUD => One more thing, pal. I saw the judge this morning.  There is no bond.
CATFISH => Grace? That you?
GRACE => Hey there, Catfish...
CATFISH => 'The hell happened?
CATFISH =>  Oh... Excuse me.
CATFISH => So where you off to?
GRACE => Goin' to visit my mother. She's real sick.
CATFISH => That's too bad. So you'll be gone a long time then.
GRACE => Yeah...
GRACE =>  Buzz.
GRACE => What can I do y'all for?
CATFISH => How come the Wheeler brothers, is locked up? And you ain't?
GRACE => Wheeler brothers is locked up? I don't know nothin' about that.
CATFISH => I heard different.
GRACE => Well there ain't no "different" to hear, Catfish. 'Cause I ain't talked to neither of 'em.
CATFISH => But you did talk to someone.
GUARD #1 =>  Open ninety-six!
RAY => This place is bad...
RAY => There's eyes everywhere. Like I got a sign on my back, Jesse, they all think I talked.
RAY => Just the other day... some spic fish got hit with a weight. Ten other cons, they beat him and stabbed him till there weren't nothin' left. And the guards let it happen.
RAY => His brains were on the wall, Jesse. Like somebody painted 'em.
JESSE => They come at you?
RAY => Not yet... But it's in the mail. I can feel it fuckin' coming.
RAY => Hey, Jesse...  Sorry I put you back here. I never meant--
JESSE =>  "Sorry", Raymond...? You ain't sorry.  I took you into my home. I tried to clean you up. And you steal from me...? You take my fuckin' diamonds?  'Cause of you, I missed the birth of my son.
BUD => Alright, let's work this...  In prison, Wheeler is credited for the expansion of the Brotherhood. When Federal split up members, they had to reorganize. So they tattooed their blood types and serial numbers on one another.
COBB => Recede and multiply.
BUD => Exactly...
BUD => Put 'em in prison, they get stronger. Everywhere you send one, they recruit in numbers. Within five years, their numbers were over ten thousand.
MARANDINO => Wheeler directed all that, huh?
BUD => What do you got there, Shep'?
SHEPARD => Interpol wired us files on three known Aryan leaders in the state of Louisiana: Edgar Bingham. Harold Kay. And this man... Lucian Adams.
SHEPARD => High priest of the Aryan National Party. His "ministry" of Christian Identity and Paramilitary Order has stood for over a decade. Check this out...
SHEPARD => Wheeler was just seventeen when he met Lucian at the Patriotic Congress.
MARANDINO => No shit.
SHEPARD => Today, Lucian's one hell of an entrepreneur. Owns surplus stores. Demolition. A piping business. Got trucks runnin' all across the God damn country.
BUD => Stay focused. Get back to Wheeler... I need an angle.
COBB => For what? If Wheeler ever flipped, news would spread like wildfire. The AB's gonna know about it. They'd gonna know about it nationally.  Pass the sugar.
BUD => That's if he was a surface informant. I don't want him to testify. I want to keep him on the street.  Look, this guy's been in it a long time. He's up to his elbows; wants to shake his hands free. I can feel it.
MARANDINO => Braddock ain't gonna go for this.
BUD => I'll handle that.
BUD => We got one chance here. 'Cause if this falls short... Jesse Wheeler's worth more dead than alive.
CZAPP => How you doin', Ray?  We was just over there wonderin' why you ain't got the courtesy to introduce us to your kin.
RAY => I was gonna.
CZAPP =>  I'm sure you was.
CZAPP => Jesse Wheeler. Heard of you...
ROACH => Fuckin-A, heard a lot.
CZAPP => Name's Czapp... You can call me, "Bossman."  I kept an eye on your brother the past few days for you. Ain't that right, Ray?
RAY =>  Yeah...
JESSE => My brother ain't none of your business.
CZAPP => Ain't none of my business, "Bossman." And everything in this fuckin' place is my business.
CZAPP =>  Listen to me, you sonofabitch. I'm gonna make one God damn thing God damn clear. Your reputation is smoke. Whatever they say you is or once was, I don't give a flyin' fuck. 'Cause it's my say-so now. And your fuckin' brother's up for grabs.
CZAPP => Y'all got that?!
ROACH =>  Fuck...
MURPHY => WHEELER!!! Stand the fuck up! Hands behind your head!
MURPHY => Hands behind your head! Get on the fuckin' floor!
DUTY GUARD => Phone call.
DUTY GUARD => It's a secure line.
JESSE =>  Yeah.
LUCIAN => Been a long time...
LUCIAN => Read about the arrest, Jesse. There's a lot of heat on this one.
JESSE => I don't want my brother touched.
LUCIAN =>  I ain't callin' about your brother. I'm callin' about you...
LUCIAN => You should have come to me sooner, Jesse. None of this would have happened.
JESSE => I'm askin' you, Lucian. My brother ain't a problem.
LUCIAN => Your brother's a fuck up.
LUCIAN => And Jesse... We may know what you can do. But you know what we can do. Understand?
BRADDOCK => You're reachin', Bud. The leverage ain't there.
BUD => It's there. It's gotta cook a little longer, that's all.
BRADDOCK => Jesse won't so much as blink at doin' life. The fuckin' guy didn't rise in the ranks 'cause he skirts under pressure.  There's no deal to be had.
BUD => C'mon, Mike, you know what's goin' on. Ray Wheeler compromised Jesse. By that, he compromised the Brotherhood. Don't tell me there ain't no fuckin' leverage.
BRADDOCK => We need somethin' more.
BUD => Well we ain't sleepin' till we find it.
LYNN => Life. You know how fuckin' long that is, Jesse?
LYNN => So what am I supposed to do? Wait? Run?  Your friends are comin' by the house. Askin' questions, hangin' around. Waitin' for the God damn phone to ring.
LYNN => You said we were done with this. That they were out of our lives.
LYNN => We have no money, Jesse. Which means we have no fucking food. ...Say something, would you?
JESSE => It's gonna be okay.
LYNN => I'm afraid. I'm afraid for my life...
LYNN =>  ...For our baby.
BUD => Lynn Wheeler. We haven't been properly introduced. I'm Detective Bud Carter.
LYNN => I know who you are.
BUD => You have a ride home?
LYNN => We took the bus.
BUD => Take a cab.
BUD => 'You need anything...anything at all. Be sure to call me.
JESSE => Ray...
JESSE => Raymond, take a look.
BUD => Want a cup of coffee?
JESSE => MOTHERFUCKER! This how you do things?
BUD => Yeah... When I want to talk to someone, without giving the impression he's cooperatin'.
BUD => You got a problem.
JESSE => Yeah, what's that?
BUD => To start with, you're lookin' at two hundred years.
JESSE => I've done the time. I'll do it again.
BUD => I know you can do it. But can your family?
BUD => Your brother's dead, Jesse. As we're sittin' here now, he's on a slab at St. Gabriel's Morgue. The coroner's callin' it, "suicide". You and I both know that's a load of shit.  You do the time-- sure. And you never see your kid. 'Cept in here. You can recruit him. Your wife...plans...everything... Gone.  'Less you talk...to me.
JESSE => Do you hate?
BUD => What?
JESSE => Who do you hate the most? Blacks you throw in prison?
BUD => ...I dislike what they represent in the system. Not as a whole.
JESSE => And you believe that by overthrowin' Aryan nationalism and integratin' races...polluted creeds, with us...You believe you're solvin' somethin'?
BUD => I believe we survive by integrating safety. Understanding hate, and how to stop it.
JESSE => It ain't evil to fight it. It's evil to tolerate it.  Maybe you forget that, to justify what you do for a living...
BUD => Are we still in prison, or we back at the compound, havin' mass?
JESSE => You don't get it.
BUD => No, don't dictate to me what put you in here, or question my intentions with your overcooked revolution!  'Fact, I think you wanted out 'fore I even got to you! That's why you distanced yourself. That's why you're out there crackin' safes. Lookin' to live a life that ain't AB.
JESSE => In who I am, there's pressure! I work for you, I won't need a lawyer, I'll need a priest! My outside finance is gone... My wife and son, their heads wind up somewhere their bodies ain't! So tell me, why the fuck should I get involved with you?!
BUD => How about personal warranty?
JESSE => Warranty?!
BUD => Yeah, that's right! You've been a part of the problem so long, you've forgotten what the fuck that is!  "Finance..." Your wife came here on a bus to see you. I sent her home in a cab. Is that your outside fuckin' finance?!
BUD => Let me give you a little insight, pal. As to what I know... And what you think you know.
BUD => This is today...
BUD => Is that your house? That's your wife, right? Who's this guy?
BUD =>  Know where he's takin' them? Takin' your family? I got a pretty good fuckin' idea.
BUD => Look at your wife, Jesse. Look at her face. And your son. They look safe to you?  I'm all you've got! I'm all your family's got! And the longer you're in here, they're up for grabs.
BUD => So either you let that happen... Or I get the judge to allow bond. This never sees trial. And you work for me.
JUDGE => Jesse Wheeler. Please rise...
JUDGE PONDER => You stand accused of forty counts of burglary, twenty nine counts of felony theft, possession of illegal firearms, possession or dealing in unregistered weapons, possession of a controlled substance, manufacture and possession of incendiary devices, and seventeen counts of receiving stolen goods... How do you plead?
KIERSEY => Not guilty, Your Honor.
JUDGE PONDER => Let's hear the arguments for bail.
DISTRICT ATTORNEY => Your honor, this man is an habitual felon as well as a flight risk. Our office has overwhelming evidence that Mr. Wheeler is not only guilty, but also a serious threat to the community. The State recommends that bail be denied.
KIERSEY => Your honor, my client deserves a reasonable bail. He has every intention of appearing and answering to all these false charges. In addition, he is the sole provider for his wife and newborn child, who would suffer undo hardship if this man were incarcerated.
JUDGE PONDER => Bond is set at one million.
KIERSEY => Congratulations.
JESSE =>  Yeah...
JESSE =>  Okay.
MAN => How's your family?
JESSE => Let's get somethin' straight. I ain't here 'cause I'm scared. I done what I did, 'cause certain people crossed the line. They didn't keep their word.
BUD => Well my word counts.
BUD => I want a body, Jesse.
JESSE => How many you want?
COBB => 'The fuck is that?
BUD => Yard dog. Relax.
SHEPARD => Where's this motherfucker taking us?
JESSE =>  Dig here.
MARANDINO => Bud! We hit something!
BUD => Clear it off! Come on, find the edges!
BRADDOCK => How long they been down there?
BUD => Jesse tells me six months.
BRADDOCK => Six months? Bud, they're biodegraded by now. Fuckin' worm food.
BUD => We'll get an ID. Remember, we got the guy who put 'em there.
CATFISH => 'Bout time to get a new truck there, Jesse.
CATFISH => Good to see you out. A free man now.
JESSE => What's goin' on, 'Fish?
CATFISH => On a Sunday drive, that's all. The good Lord ridin' shotgun, through another glorious Louisiana mornin'.
CATFISH => Say, Jesse... Lucian's askin' about you. Fact, a lot of people are.
JESSE => You tell him I'll come by.
CATFISH =>  That's good. I'll see you real soon then.
BUD => Hey, Mike.
BRADDOCK => Bud, this is Special Agent, Martin Fitch. He's down from Washington. With the Attorney General.
FITCH => Martin. Just call me Martin.
BRADDOCK => Martin's gonna be soliciting Jesse's case for a Federal sponsor.
BUD => How long you been with the Attorney General, Fitch?
FITCH => Just over a year.
FITCH => I want to assure you my education and experience is more than adequate to handle a case of this potential.
BUD => Is that right...
BRADDOCK => Why don't we get to the particulars?
FITCH => Right. Alright.  To get Jesse a federal sponsor, we need something substantial. A bait. In the Justice Department, we have this mission statement... We decide who the target is, what's the threat assessment, the cost value, over what time table it's gonna take place... Which target do we go after first. We don't want to miss a big target hitting a smaller target, you understand?
BUD => No.
FITCH => Well, exposing bodies has limitations. Those people are dead. We can't retrieve their lives.
BRADDOCK => He means there might not be enough to back Jesse.
BUD => Keep him on the street without protection, he winds up dead.
FITCH => What I'm saying is, we need fresh leads. He'll need to present something that separates him from those we're going to arrest. If Jesse can't offer something continuous... I'm afraid we can't be of much help.
WAITRESS => Ready to order?
FITCH =>  Yes. I'll take a garden salad. Roquefort on the side.
WAITRESS => You'll take what?
FITCH =>  It's a dressing.
WAITRESS => Well...we got ranch, thousand island and oil. Which one you want?
BUD => Lost my appetite.
BUD => I set this up. Me and Jesse. If the Feds want to help, that's fine. But not him.
BRADDOCK => What do you mean, "me and Jesse?" He's not your partner, Bud. This case is beyond our capacity. It requires resources we don't have.
BUD => They ain't takin' us serious, Mike. They send us some kid with a year under his belt?! He don't even know what state he's in... You want him in charge?!
BRADDOCK => You're God damn right I do! You're out on a limb on this already, Bud! It's my job to make sure you get back!
BUD => This is bullshit.
BRADDOCK => That may be. What it ain't, is open for discussion.
JESSE => Y'all wanna talk about crime? Well I could tell y'all things. Names. Locations. What boat is movin' what drugs, which one is guns. Who's gonna get cut up and why. ...But what I got to know is, if 'n when I do this... If I wear your dog collar... Y'all gonna do what's right by me and keep my head from gettin' shot the fuck off? 'Cause the truth is, you need me. You ain't got enough cops with enough sense or enough time, to clear them crimes that already been committed and will be.  Y'all need me... I got the devil's address.
FITCH => Okay, great... Thanks. Thank you, Jesse, for that. And thank you, everyone for attending...  Uh, we all know why we're here. To solve a matter of custody--
FBI #1 => We'll protect you and your family, Jesse.  It's a federal matter, gentlemen. Those bodies were transported over state lines.
ATF #1 => Not so fast. Ammunition, grenades? This man's house was a factory, for Christ's sake. ATF is taking this.
DEA => Those murders were drug related. DEA's got to do follow ups.
SECRET SERVICE => He was printing counterfeit money. That's Secret Service.
JESSE => There's a hit list.
FITCH => Wait! Wait a minute, quiet! Everyone quiet!
FITCH => A what?
JESSE => A hit list. There's much as twelve. Might be one or two less now, I ain't sure. Some could've already been gotten.
BUD =>  Now we're talkin'.
FBI #2 => Why these twelve, Jesse?
JESSE => Different reasons. It ain't so much why or what they done that matters. Pick any one of 'em off that list, AB puts you on salary.
JESSE => And you, sir, if I ain't mistaken... You're Mr. Nokes, right?
JESSE => First U.S. Attorney, John Nokes?
NOKES => That's right.
JESSE => Well, last time I seen it...you was number two on that list.
NOKES => Can you fill us in on the rest of those names, Jesse?
JESSE => Yes, I can. But there's something I gotta make clear 'fore that happens.
NOKES => What's that?
JESSE => I've listened to you, Mr. Nokes. And I've listened to these suits here, on who's gonna take me in...  I will die, go to hell and take all y'all cocksuckers with me, if he--  --tells me to.  I want y'all to know that.
NOKES =>  How's that fly by you, Lieutenant?
NOKES => I'll sponsor him. Jesse's welfare will come out of our budget. Anyone has pending cases or leads for Jesse, see me. I'll loan him out.
NOKES => And, Jesse... I'm a little pissed I'm number two on that list. Who the fuck is number one?
BUZZ => Jesse.
JESSE => I'm here to see Lucian.
CATFISH => He's busy right now; You can come in and wait.
MALE VOICE => This operation of your's has become big business. You need relationships now more than ever...
MORRIS => ...We've done business successfully before, Mr. Adams. But it's a larger scope now. I'm here today because I want to represent you exclusively. You need someone lobbying at a state level, as well as in Washington. My organization can provide both. We've got contacts that you don't have and other people can't get. Now, I'm aware that you have multiple businesses... However you need one go-to guy, so that all your ventures stay coordinated and all transactions and contracts are realized. I am that person, Mr. Adams. That's what I do.
KIERSEY => What's this going to cost us?
MORRIS => As a retainer, I want an advance of three hundred-fifty thousand, along with ten percent of whatever economic benefit I bring to this organization.
KIERSEY => Three-fifty? C'mon, Dick. That's out of line.
MORRIS => If you want a quality global economic plan, that's what you pay for--
LUCIAN => We'll give you two, Mr. Morris...That's what it's worth.
LUCIAN => The advance is a drop in the bucket. The real money is the percentage. It's in your interest to see it my way.
MORRIS => You've got a deal.
LUCIAN =>  Give us a minute.
LUCIAN => You have a son now, right?
JESSE => Yeah...
LUCIAN => What'd you name him?
JESSE => I named him Ray.
LUCIAN =>  Heard the cops smacked you around inside.
JESSE => 'Wasn't too bad.
LUCIAN => You've been a busy man, Jesse. More ways than one.
JESSE => Looks like you done just fine without me. Business rollin' through the door.
LUCIAN => Last I saw you, you asked for time. Time to raise a family. Time to straighten things out.  I gave you that time... Then safe jobs start poppin' up. Lafayette. New Orleans. Clinton. Baton Rouge. All over. The boys, they think it's niggers, gone widespread on a hunt for pig's feet. But they all professional. Burn jobs. Hot-weld oxygen. Laid out, burned, laid back, perfect.  I knew right then and there, only a white respectable burglar could've done this.
LUCIAN => Jesse... With all the work you been doin': Diamonds. Emeralds. A dozen safe jobs, behind my back...  Where's the tribute to the greater cause?
JESSE => Like I said, I just needed time.
LUCIAN => Well, even prophets stumble once in a while.
LUCIAN => It's a shame about your brother.
LYNN => I don't understand. Why do we have to leave the state? You're not tellin' me something. You're not tellin' me a lot.
JESSE => It ain't safe here no more. You wanted out? This is out.
JESSE => Lucian took the stones. Talked about jobs. High-end, boxcar.
BUD => Your family's safe now.  Let's go to work.
KIERSEY => There's a variety of matters to discuss today, gentlemen. Eddie Moran's trial starts next week. One of the jurors reached out. He's asking six thousand up front plus a job at four hundred a week. That guarantees a hung jury with a push for an acquittal.
LUCIAN => Three hundred. Give him a no-show at the trucking firm.
KIERSEY =>  Construction on the building Morris brought us, in south-east Florida, is complete. Every unit sold. We should see revenues of one point four million over our original projections.
KIERSEY => Lastly, our "friends" from the Middle East. They put a final offer on the table. They'll fund our operation in Louisiana if we agree to act on their behalf. Political targets mostly, on the basis of our approval...  I advise we do a test case. Perhaps a sample of their resources.
LUCIAN => "Final offer?" Demands...  Close the deal. We'll cook the cash for it. By the time they realize, we'll have our return.  You believe they're travelin' all the way to Louisiana just to get fuckin' robbed?
LUCIAN => I want you runnin' point on this one...
JESSE => I'll be honest, I was hopin' for somethin' bigger.
LUCIAN => What do you got in mind?
JESSE => How 'bout a few of them heads off the list?
LUCIAN => We got guys for that now. Catfish, Buzz. What do you want to go back to that for?
JESSE => The money's worth twice this. Bring back a head it's fifteen grand; Bring a heart, it's thirty, right?
LUCIAN => Tell you what. Do this other thing we got lined up...  Then I'll give you that taste.
FITCH => There's pressure from Washington. They send compliments for Jesse's work. But our primary concern is that list. I need names we can protect.
BUD => We know that, Fitch. He's workin' on it.
FITCH => If Jesse can just get a direct order... from Lucian to him, on a wire--
BUD => --A wire?! He just went back to work, you want him to wear a fuckin' wire?  Put a tap on that God damn lawyer's phone, that's what you should do.
FITCH => He's an attorney, Carter. Anything we get would be inadmissable.
BUD => It's information, Fitch.
FITCH => Bud. We need Jesse to engage Lucian on the record. Otherwise it's just hearsay. He's disconnected from everything, like a ghost.
JESSE =>  Catfish.
CATFISH => Go 'head. Count it.
NASEEM => There a problem?
JESSE => No problem. Money's all there.
CATFISH => 'The fuck you lookin' at...?
JESSE =>  Catfish, would you shut the fuck up? This ain't the time.
NASEEM =>  Yes, listen to your boss.
CATFISH => What?! What fuckin' "boss?" You best watch your ass, sand nigger.
NASEEM => Piece of shit--!
JESSE => Take it easy! Take it easy!
A VOICE =>  ATF! THE PERIMETER'S SURROUNDED!
JESSE => You're a piece of work, Catfish.
CATFISH => Them niggers crossed the line...I had to burn 'em--
JESSE => --You had to keep your mouth shut! On a job, you don't do fuckin' shit 'less I say!
CATFISH => 'The fuck off me--!
JESSE =>  Fuck me up again, you hear me? I'll leave you where I find you. Got that?
JESSE => Unload the fuckin' truck.
FITCH => Keep your voice down! This was out of my control!
BUD => I'm telling you, your agents best pull their shit together! Who the hell y'all trying to protect?!
FITCH => Look, Carter. This is a joint task force with multiple agendas, that run up the chain of command through me. Intel came forth at the eleventh hour that Naseem Kazuri - an international arms dealer - would be present at this meet. ATF was tasked to observe and report.
BUD => That ain't what they did--!
FITCH => --No! Because your informant--
BUD => My informant, that's right!--
FITCH => --Your informant and his psychopath crew greased half our political interests -- over a bag of fake cash! You weren't informed, so what?
BUD => Well I better be informed! 'Cause this ain't fallin' short! Now, any of y'all got a collaborative agenda in the works? I want to see it. These other agencies, what time-lines they lookin' at? What deadlines and why?
FITCH => Above your pay-grade--
BUD =>  And is there a purposeful lack of communication between competing agencies, who are right now charting future mistakes, as we fuckin' speak?!
FITCH => That's not your concern, Carter!
BUD => We're not talkin' about me!!
BRADDOCK => Bud!
BUD =>  What?!
BRADDOCK => You're over-involved here.
BRADDOCK => I'll handle this.
FITCH => Thanks for coming down, Mike. He's been berating my agents for the last hour.
FITCH => We're trying to band-aid a situation here, and frankly, Carter's preference for thug tactics isn't helping. It'll all be in my report...
BRADDOCK =>  "Isn't helping?"
BRADDOCK => "Isn't helping?" Let's not miss what happened here, Fitch. We work for the same cause doesn't mean we work for you. What are you gonna do now? Send Jesse back out? Earn his trust? Bud Carter delivered the biggest informant in the history of this state to your lap, and you and the people you work for are gonna let it go to shit.  You can expect that will be in my report.
MORRIS => Look. I had no previous knowledge of any business with Muslims. So if stealing me here in the middle of the night, is some kind of accusation--
LUCIAN => I'm not accusing you, Mr. Morris. But I do find it interesting that right about the time I employ you, my operation starts having problems.
MORRIS => Yes, but--
LUCIAN => That is interesting...isn't it?
LUCIAN => I want to know if this was an isolated incident. If the ATF impeding on my work is the result of a deeper threat.
MORRIS => What are you suggesting?
LUCIAN => I'm suggesting you contact your friends in Washington.
MORRIS => With all due respect, Mr. Adams, that's not what I was retained for.
LUCIAN => Well now it is.
MORRIS => That sort of information requires clearance I don't have. If I start sniffing around, people are going to ask questions.
LUCIAN => I'm asking questions, Mr. Morris. And I'm getting impatient.
LUCIAN => You don't leave here till I get answers.
LYNN =>  Hello...
JESSE => It's me.
LYNN => You okay?  Honey, you alright?
JESSE => I'm okay. Just need to hear your voice. How's little Ray...?
LYNN => I'll put him on.
LYNN => It's daddy on the phone, say hello.
LYNN => Jesse?
BUD => Where the hell you been?  Two days missin', you broke protocol. Three, and you're a flight risk. Agents'll hunt your ass down.
JESSE =>  I can't keep doin' this. I can't fuckin' breathe. Even the shadows got eyes.
BUD => This is the job. If I don't hear from you, I can't protect you.
JESSE =>  Protect me?! I about got my head fuckin' shot off, 'cause your guys was "protecting" me!
BUD => Those ain't my guys!
JESSE => I don't give a fuck-- I don't want your protection! I want out!
BUD => There is no "out." Not for either of us. Not till it's done...  Get me that list.
BUD => I'm losin' him, Mike...
BRADDOCK => Just relax. We gotta let things settle, that's all.
BUD => It ain't gonna settle, it's gonna blow. I can feel it.
BRADDOCK => What do you want me to do?
BUD => Push 'em back.
BRADDOCK => Who?
BUD => The Feds. All these suits, fuckin' outsiders. Everyone. Get me some room. Some time to reel this thing in.
BRADDOCK => I'll talk to Nokes. 'See what I can do.
MORRIS => There's an investigation underway, funded by the U.S. Attorney. And you're the target.
MORRIS => They're receiving assistance from both the ATF and FBI, who are stationed right here in Henderson.
LUCIAN =>  How long they been active?
MORRIS => My sources tell me three months.
LUCIAN => Three months...
KIERSEY =>  This is U.S. Attorney John Nokes, at the helm. He's been after us for years.
LUCIAN => Who they got for a mouthpiece?
MORRIS => A "mouthpiece"?
LUCIAN => Who's the rat in the woodpile? Who the fuck's giving 'em information?
MORRIS => I couldn't dig that deep. But it's someone close.  I suggest you gentlemen disband. Immediately.
KIERSEY => Lucian...
LUCIAN => Yeah.
KIERSEY => The investigation's local point is a detective out of East Baton Rouge.  His name's Bud Carter.
LUCIAN => Couldn't sleep.
JESSE => Got somethin' on your mind?
LUCIAN =>  There's been an adjustment to the list, Jesse...
LUCIAN => We got this...heathen. A whore of an Irishman...down in Baton Rouge. He's protected. Got a lot of guys around him. That's why it pays. That's why nobody wants the job... That's why we're here talkin'.
JESSE => Who is it?
LUCIAN => This cop... he's got a mouthpiece... somewhere. Ain't yet figured out who. In the meantime, shut him down.
JESSE => It's done.
BUZZ => That's his truck.
CATFISH =>  Let's see what he does.
CATFISH => The fuck's takin' so long?  I would've shot that pig dead already... 'made a pulled-pork sandwich.
BUZZ => Give him a minute. That's a cop, lives there.
CATFISH =>  I'll give him two.
BUD => Jesse. 'The hell you doin' here?
JESSE => You been made, Bud. We gotta skin out.
CATFISH => Somethin's wrong...
BUZZ => Relax, Catfish. You said two minutes.
CATFISH => Fuck you, man! This don't feel right.
BUZZ => Just give it a second.  A few more seconds, right guys?
CATFISH => Let's kill 'em both. Let's do it now, right now, let's go--
BUZZ => Catfish--
CATFISH =>  LET'S GO!!!
SHEPARD =>  Yeah.
BUD =>  Hey. Meet me at the office in ten minutes. Cobb and Marandino too.
SHEPARD =>  Why, what's up?
BUD =>  I'll explain later. Just get there. Now.
BUD =>  Let's hit it.
CATFISH => That's them! Together, you see?!
BUZZ => I see 'em--
CATFISH => You see?! They're fuckin' dead!
DISPATCHER =>  All units: 10-17 in progress. 1825 Hyacinth. Multiple shots fired--
SHEPARD => What the fuck?
DISPATCHER => --Units please respond...
JESSE =>  Fuck!
BUD => Shepard!  No...
BUD =>  We run 'em now, Mike. Right fuckin' now!
BRADDOCK =>  What do you need?
SWAT #1 => Nothing.
COBB => No one here, Bud...
COBB =>  Empty.
DOCTOR => His bleeding's under control. There's tissue damage. Projectile fragmentation in the right forearm. We have most of it removed. Two fingers are gone. A portion of the palm. There's no chance of reconstruction.  I'll be monitoring his vitals.
BRADDOCK =>  You have to let go now.
BRADDOCK => It's over.
BUD => It's not.
BRADDOCK =>  The cover's blown. Lucian's gone. There ain't nothin' left on this one.
BRADDOCK => Get to a safe-house, Bud.  'Squad car over there is your's.
COBB => ...His cranium was smashed with a lead pipe. Then the plastic bag. He choked to death while it filled up with blood.
BUD => Got I.D.?
COBB => 'Name's Richard Morris. He's a top dog lawyer-lobbyist out of Washington.
BUD => Put a tap on that line.
COBB => Braddock ain't gonna like it.
BUD => Do it.
BRADDOCK => Bud. I just got off with Nokes.
BUD => And?
BRADDOCK => We got a problem.
BUD => Give us a minute, Doc.
JESSE => Where you been?
TOM => Anything else while we're out, Mrs. Wheeler?
LYNN => No thank you.
JESSE => There's a dozen cops comin' in and outta this place. No one's sayin' shit. 'The hell's goin' on?
LABORER #1 =>  Wait here a moment, sir.
LABORER #1 =>  Thanks for waiting. Go ahead.
JESSE => Get me out of here, Bud. I want to see my family.
BUD => There is no family.
BUD => I'm sorry...
BARTENDER =>  He's out of his mind. 'Asked him to slow down; and he punched me in the face.
COBB =>  Hey, Pete. You alright?
BARTENDER => I'm alright. The bar ain't.
MARANDINO =>  We'll smooth it out. Clear the street.
BUD => Y'all fuck with me? Huh? You want to fuck with me?
COBB => Jesus Christ.
BUD => 'Look at me when I talk to you.  You try and kill me? You like killin' women and kids?
COBB => Bud...
MARANDINO => Easy, Bud... Easy...
COBB => We got you here, Bud... It's just us. Hear me?
COBB => Let's go home...
FBI #4 => We're here to escort Mr. Wheeler.
POLICE OFFICER =>  Sign this.
FBI #4 => Check the bathroom.
FBI #4 => Sonofabitch. This guy's crazy.
NOKES => This is an atrocity, gentlemen. Incompetence at it's highest level. I gave you my name. My resources. My trust...Carte blanche. And now this handsome face of mine...can't step foot in Washington, for fear of being laughed off the Hill.
NOKES => Now, I'd love to point to Local on this. But truth is, they've carried their weight. We are federally fucked...  Because Federal fucked up.
NOKES => So. Best idea wins, gentlemen. Chain of command? Point of procedure? I don't give a fuck. That's out the window, just like our informant...  I want Jesse Wheeler found.
BRADDOCK => You smell like a fuckin' distillery, Bud. Clean up... 'find your boy.
LONG-HAIR => Who's there?
LONG-HAIR => What the fuck?!
JESSE => Get out.
JESSE => We got some shit to discuss.
BUZZ => Ain't got nothin' to say to you, Wheeler.
LONG-HAIR =>  I need a doctor! I need a fuckin' doctor!
BUZZ => FUCK! FUCK! OH, FUCK!
JESSE => House call.
JESSE => Where's Lucian?!
BUZZ => I don't know!
BUZZ => NO ONE KNOWS WHERE LUCIAN IS! NO ONE KNOWS-
BUZZ => ...fuck...
JESSE => Who killed my family?
BUZZ => Ah shit, man!
JESSE =>  WHO KILLED 'EM?! CATFISH?!
BUZZ => CATFISH, YES, YEAH! FUCKIN' CATFISH!
BUZZ =>  The fuck is that?  WAIT, WAIT! WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?!
BUZZ =>  NO! NO, NO, NO, DON'T!! DON'T!!
COBB => We've had a tap on Kiersey's line forty eight hours now. It's clean. Whatever's he's up to, Bud, it ain't comin' through the front door.
FITCH => Carter! We need to talk.
BUD => Get out of my way, Fitch.
FITCH =>  This is my investigation. Jesse's cowboy bullshit is not how it's done!
BUD => While your agents build their cases and set for court, he'll erase the debt owed to all of you. Overnight.
FITCH => So you're implying I should thank him?
FITCH => Look, Carter, whether we like it or not, you and I have to work together on this. We entice Jesse back. I'll get him full protection, if he agrees to testify.
BUD => That'll never happen.
FITCH => Why the hell not?!
BUD =>  'Cause it's over, Fitch. It's done. He has nothing. Why do you think he lit that fire? To plant a flag. To let us know he doesn't need our protection. Doesn't want it. He would've just left 'em for dead.
FITCH => For God sakes, listen to me! I'm not taking the fall for this! The plan is--
BUD => No, the truth is, Fitch, you ain't got balls big enough to relate to this guy. If you had listened to me, we wouldn't be in this situation. Jesse wouldn't be in this situation. And you wouldn't be askin' stupid fuckin' questions!  I'll bring him in myself. Just keep your agents off my ass.
KIERSEY => Get back to the office. Follow up on the Arthur Bierce case. I need names and numbers on my desk by three pm.
KIERSEY => OH, CHRIST! JESUS CHRIST! MY HANDS!
BUD => You know who I am?
KIERSEY => OPEN THE TRUNK! PLEASE! OPEN THE TRUNK!
BUD => You know who the fuck I am?!
KIERSEY => YES!
BUD => Who's Richard Morris?! Why was he killed?
BUD => I'll break every fuckin' bone you got. Start talkin'.
KIERSEY =>  I can't-- I can't--
BUD =>  Can't what?! What can't you do?!
BUD => You piece of shit, talk!
KIERSEY =>  He made Jesse...The investigation... Everything...
BUD => His family?
KIERSEY => Everything! After that, he was just a loose end!
BUD => Where's Lucian Adams?
KIERSEY => I don't know!
BUD => Lucian's goin' down. You either go down together, or you give him to me.
KIERSEY =>  I never talk to him directly! I swear, they page me--
KIERSEY => --Every night at five, for a six o'clock call! They page from different numbers!
BUD => You're a dead man, Kiersey.
TATTOO ARTIST => 'Bout out of room, Catfish. You best start collectin' scalps.
CATFISH =>  What the fuck?!
BUD => What do you got?
MARANDINO => He's in the French Quarter. All numbers paging Kiersey between five and six p.m., the last seventy-two hours, are pay phones within a three mile radius.
BUD => Alright.
COBB => Bud, you gotta talk to Braddock. He's lookin' for you, he's fuckin' pissed.
BUD => Hold him off. I'll square it with him when I get to the Quarter.
JESSE => I'm gonna ask questions...
JESSE => When I'm satisfied with your answers, I'm gonna kill you. How long it takes and how much blood you want to spill...that's up to you.
CATFISH => What do you want to know? Want to hear about your brother? How we had him shot up with strychnine? How he died slow death?
CATFISH => OH, YOU SONOFABITCH!!!
JESSE => Four days ago, my wife and son were killed.  I hear you took the contract?
CATFISH => Forty-four pounds, Miznay-Schardin. Like you taught me. Fuck yeah, I took it. Blew your bitch and kid sky high.
CATFISH => MOTHERFUCKER!!!
CATFISH =>  OH, YOU'RE GONNA DIE! YOU'RE GONNA FUCKIN' DIE!
JESSE => Where's Lucian?
JESSE => Where's he hidin' out?
CATFISH => Get fucked.
JESSE => Where's Lucian?
JESSE => Where's Lucian?
CATFISH =>  New Orleans...
JESSE => New Orleans. Where in New Orleans?
CATFISH => New Orleans...
JESSE =>  I believe you.
BUD =>  It's Bud. I got a number.
BUD => 504-767-8092
COBB =>  Governor Nicholls Wharf. Between St. Ann and Toulouse. You're a half mile south.
BUD => Get your ass down here.
BUD => Here we go.
RECEPTIONIST =>  You've reached the law offices of Daniel J. Kiersey--
KIERSEY =>  Hello, you've reached the Kiersey residence. No one's home right now--
JACKET => Should've been on the road twenty minutes ago. Hurry it up.
SECURITY GUARD => What's goin' on, Jack?
MILLS => Talk to me.
JACKET => Got nothin' to tell. Kiersey didn't call.
MILLS => Try his office?
JACKET => 'Ain't there. His home neither.
MILLS =>  It's Mills. I need sweepers through Baton Rouge. Find Daniel Kiersey.  Keep pagin' him.
BUD => C'mon. Show me somethin'.
BRADDOCK => Mr. Kiersey. I'm Captain Mike Braddock. How can I help you?
KIERSEY => Detective Bud Carter is out of control!
BRADDOCK =>  Detective "Lieutenant." Now how can I help you?
KIERSEY => How long till you make an arrest in your investigation of Lucian Adams?
KIERSEY => I'm willing to provide you with documents and information to secure his conviction.
BRADDOCK => Why?
KIERSEY => Why do you think? I'm afraid for my life.  I'll confirm whatever Jesse Wheeler's given you.
COBB =>  Got a possible here.
COBB =>  Town Car. Black. Second time around.
COBB =>  Bud, you see this?
COBB =>  They're on the second floor.
BUD =>  It's Bud...
BRADDOCK => You better have something fuckin' good.
BUD => I'm in the French Quarter. Sittin' on AB activity.
BRADDOCK => Lucian?
BUD => Don't know yet. I got Harold Kay so far.
BUD => Looks like they own the God damn block.
BRADDOCK => Well I got Kiersey just walked in. Two fractured wrists and scared as all hell.
BUD => I can explain--
BRADDOCK => He wants to make a deal, Bud. I can keep Nokes in the dark twenty-four hours, but that's it.
COBB =>  Bud, we got movement.
BUD =>  Hold on, Mike.
BUD =>  Go ahead...
COBB =>  Holy shit.
COBB =>  It's cookin', Bud. It's cookin' fast.
BUD =>  Mike, I've got Edgar Bingham now. Just showed with two of his crew, for a sit down with Kay.
COBB =>  Marandino, they comin' your way.
BUD =>  Got 'em.
MARANDINO =>  They're inside.
BUD =>  Mike, I need Kiersey to place a call. Five minutes, or this opportunity's gone.
BRADDOCK =>  Give me the number...
MILLS =>  Excuse me.
MILLS =>  Yeah...
MILLS =>  We've been pagin' you over two hours. Where the fuck you been?
KIERSEY => I apologize. I've been tooth and nail with the D.A., in court, all day.
MILLS => Everything good?
KIERSEY => Everything's fine. Just lay low. Regular time tomorrow.
KIERSEY => Now get me protection.
BINGHAM => So?
MILLS => All good. Let's eat.
MARANDINO =>  Call went down.
MARANDINO =>  Entering Tibedaux's Tavern...
DOORMAN #1 => Can we help you?
COBB => Just lookin' for a drink and a bite to eat.
DOORMAN #1 => Think you'll find what you're lookin' for across the street.  Try the cafe.
COBB => Alright. Thanks.
COBB =>  Negative at Tibedaux's. Can't walk in. What's our move?
BUD =>  We wait.
MARANDINO =>  I've got movement. Back alley...
BUD =>  Talk to me.
MARANDINO =>  I've got a man on the south balcony. Armed.
MARANDINO =>  Second man at the door now. Street level. Possibly armed.
MARANDINO =>  A Cadillac and a Grand Marquis, just pulled in the alley.
MARANDINO =>  Bud... we got Lucian Adams...
BUD =>  Hold position. Give me a head count.
MARANDINO =>  Two men flanking. Drivers have not left the cars. Initial perps still on post. Lucian's entering the building...
MARANDINO =>  I need eyes on a single, white male crossing Esplanade. Possible intent...
BUD =>  It's Jesse...
COBB =>  He's heading toward the alley, Bud. We take him down?
BUD => Let him go.
COBB => What?!
BUD =>  Let him go.
COBB => Bud, that's crazy! Jesse goes in first, he's gonna blow this whole thing. We can't let that happen.
BUD =>  That's exactly what we're gonna do! We got no way inside. Let Jesse go in hard and draw fire. He pushes Lucian out to us. Stand the fuck down. I'm on my way.
MARANDINO =>  I don't see him. I got nothin'...
MARANDINO => Fuck!
MARANDINO =>  Shots fired! Shots fired!
MARANDINO =>  Jesse hit four men! What do you want me to do?!
BUD =>  Call it in! Local and SWAT! Get the place surrounded!
AB #7 => Let's go. We're gettin' you out of here.
JACKET => Give me that fuckin' shotgun!
COBB =>  POLICE! TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE GUN! STEP FUCKIN' BACK!!
BUD => Jam the alley! No one goes in or out!
COBB => Down! Get down!
BUD => Stay on the door! I'm goin' in!
COBB =>  I'm hit. I'm fuckin' hit.
BUD =>  I got him... I got Lucian.
BUD => Want a cup of coffee?
