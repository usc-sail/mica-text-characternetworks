TRAILER ANNOUNCER => Winner of the Palm D'or, The Golden Bear, The Laughing Monkey and over 350 film critics' '10 BEST' picture lists, and hailed by Roger Ebert as "A MASTERPIECE
BLACK => The thumping blade gets LOUDER AND LOUDER, the BASS LINE of "BREAK ON THROUGH TO THE OTHER SIDE" rising with it until finally...
MOTOWN => That's for Brooklyn, Muthafucka! Underneath the hovering chopper, OSIRIS,a black, buffed out Rambo-looking Sergeant, is letting loose his M-16 with abandon, yelling at the pilot to get the bird lower. It does. Fats grabs. the mortally wounded Brooklyn and slings him over his shoulder, Brooklyn's shirt is blown open revealing his entrails...in shock, he clutches his liver in his right hand, and is trying futilely to put it back in his body...
4 41 => FATS ignores him and continueb firing. MOTOWN comes running up to the chopper...
MOTOWN =>  SIR! Requesting permission to disobey Sergeant's orders, SIR! FOUR LEAF IS
CHOPPER PILOT => Sir! We gotta DIDI NOW! Air strike confirmed! This place is gonna be toast in about thirty seconds! Osiris turns on Motown, pulling his .45 in the midst of the mayhem. He pushes it up into Motown's neck.
BROOKLYN => A 1, I qft I Id Sarge... .We PUSH IN ON BROOKLYN dramatically as he raises his head. Looking off to the tree line, he points a crooked finger...
BROOKLYN => It's him. It's Four Leaf... Everyone turns to-see... FOUR LEAF, who looks a lot like CHRIS MICHAEL SPEEDMAN from the "Scorcher" trailer, . burst through the treeline, half limping, half crawling heroically through the massive firefight in SLOW MOTION. He is being chased.by about-FIFTY _VIET...CONG SOLDIERS... Everyone on board seems mesmerized. Osiris sees it, and can't believe his eyes... nevertheless, he screams to the pilot. I
GO! GO! => Fats, still on the ground, in defiance of Osiris, grabs the chopper's runner, and in a superhuman show of strength, OR IS IT WEIGHT, holds it with-all-his might, preventing it from flying away. The pilot struggles with the controls, as Fats continues his barrage of bullets with his machine gun arm, providing weak cover for Four Leaf. The chopper is now gaining momentum, and pulls Fats about ten feet-off-the ground. He is, about to lose his battle with the helicopter. Four Leaf, riddled with bullets, and delirious, is fighting a losing battle to gain ground... He doesn't even have a gun...
fire ... => Osiris finally makes it and kneels beside Four Leaf, cradling his head. Four Leaf's eyes are glassy, and his body and arms are ripped open all over like a rag doll.
FOUR LEAF => Get outta here. I'm worm food, man, you dig?
OSIRIS =>  What, and give up all that California pussy you been talking about? Shiiit. Someone's gotta show me around L.A...
FOUR LEAF =>  Shit. . .the only way you're gonna get a piece of LA pussy if is you go out to the graveyard and dig some up... Osiris looks down at Four Leaf's now missing arms...
OSIRIS => Well ...y...you better come along and bring the shovel... He starts to choke up.
FOUR LEAF => I'm scared,. Sarge. 'Scared I ain't never gonna see another sunset.  Why does a man want to pick up sticks against another man... 'Stead of usin' them sticks. to prop a man up? Osiris nods, now crying like a baby... 4Id Iu I. Igft
FOUR LEAF =>  Hold my hands... 'cause I got somethin' to say... Osiris looks down.at Four. Leaf's bloody, stringy stumps. There's nothing to hold...
FOUR LEAF => Are, you holding them?
FOUR LEAF => I ain't never been worth a. nothin' in this life, and it's kinda late to start b e i' a somethin' now. But you... you are my... b-b-brother. Four Leaf screws.up.his .face and begins to cry--except that he can't. He tries again... and can't.. Hescrews up his face grotesquely...
FOUR LEAF => You are my... WE NOW PULL BACK TO REVEAL we are actually on location shooting this war scene with about 50 CREW MEMBERS watching, surrounded by millions of dollars worth of film equipment. Four Leaf, actually the superstar. playing him, Speedman, is getting increasingly self-conscious, becoming more and. more aware of the-crew waiting for him to cry. The actor playing Osiris, KIRK LAZARUS, is also getting uncomfortable holding Speedman's not-crying head.
SPEEDMAN =>  I'm sorry, can we cut, Damien? Damien grips his headphones in confusion, looking around to his cadre of assistants and ADs... The chopper continues to hover, soldiers continue to fight, except a few are starting to wonder what's going on.
SPEEDMAN => CUT! We gotta cut, Dorf!
1ST AD => Play it through! Still rolling!
SPEEDMAN => No! Not still rolling! Cut! Damien runs towards Speedman. Fats, who is young fat comedy gross-out star JEFF PORTNOY, gets up from the ground, rubbing his butt.
PORTNOY => OW, SHIT! I fell right on my ass bone! Other "dead" extras begin to hold their heads up and look around. Some are amputee stuntmen.
1ST AD =>  Damien? Are we cutting? 1st AD jumps off the scaffold, running towards the director. Tekkies scurry around, lots of confusion. Are they cut, or what? Brooklyn,'.played by the not-famous KEVIN SANDUSKY,Ihold s his bloody "liver" up to hand off to someone.
SANDUSKY => Mr. Dorfman? Are we cutting sir? Cause .I think they put w ay too much blood in my liver again.
DAMIEN => STILL ROLLING! Get down Kevin, you're dead! Sandusky immediately complies, he seems to be the only actor listening to the director.
SPEEDMAN => I'm sorry.. I can't do it, Dorff. Damien runs up to Speedman. They are the center of attention -- the whole crew watching them.
DAMIEN => It's good, keep going. This is a big shot so keep going, let it come. No arms, you're hanging on, it's-al-1-coming out... It's real, death, life, brotherhood and we just... let's keep it going now... He starts to back out, turning his finger in the "still rolling" motion. He gives a thumbs up to the AD.

CODY => Is that the signal?
'IYd "' => Damien has his hands full with Speedman.
SPEEDMAN => (above the din of the
CHOPPER) => Dorf! Seriously, I think we should cut. I mean, Should Osiris be crying too? Maybe he shouldn't cry if I'm crying... Lazarus abruptly drops Speedman from his arms and gets up, shaking his head.
LAZARUS => I'm sorry, so, just keep crying or are'we cutting??
DAMIEN => No, no, it's good. Portnoy is walking around massaging his butt.
PORTNOY => Damien, I think I broke my ass. Is it possible to break your ass?
DAMIEN => Get back in character Portnoy! Still rolling everyone!  Great crying Kirk -- stay with that. Chris Michael, don't worry about where Kirk is at, just be Four Leaf crying right here and now and still rolling... and GO!
CODY => Did he say "go"? 
'111 => Lazarus gets back in position. He effortlessly turns.the waterworks back on, sobbing like .,a broken man. Speedman .starts to get back into position and then :--
SPEEDMAN => Wait, hey, y'know, maybe- is it the line? "You are my brothers"? I don't think I would.say that. Four Leaf wouldn't say that.
DAMIEN => Yes, well-you see, Four Leaf was there and he did say that. So... Right. So let's just go...
SPEEDMAN => Is he here, or is he-'at the.hotel? Because I would love to run it by him.
1ST AD => Damien! The chopper! I got to let them go! We,need to pull the plug on the treeline burst if you're cutting!
LAZARUS => You know what, this is nuts. You got my take. I'm done.  Movie star. We'll be here till Chinese New Year waitin.' for my man to. cry.
DAMIEN => Kirk! Wait! Lazarus keeps walking.
DAMIEN => Kirk!
LAZARUS => .You got my take.

REDYKULOUS => Hey, can we get this going? I got peeps coming to my room to rub me down at 4. Bitches, too. His phone rings again.
REDYKULOUS =>  Hey! What's up! Naw, nothing -- same soup, just re-heated, you know? Redykulous wanders off in another direction. The AD is now yelling into Damien's ear.
DAMIEN =>  EVERYONE! Please! The chopper only has so much gas! PORTNOY, trying to lighten the mood, rips a huge FART.
PORTNOY => Plenty of gas right here, D-man! (then feeling the pain in his
REDYKULOUS => Hey, yo! I am trying to have a conversation here!
DAMIEN => Okay, fine! Fuck me! What the fuck do I know? I'm just the fucking...  Godfuckit! Damien throws his headphones off in frustration... and throws up his hands.
CODY => There's the signal! GO! GO! GO! Let's light this puppy up! Let's go freaking 11 TET here!! i Cody and his assistants push plungers, buttons, pull levers, and drag metal wands over long lines of wired nails, they spark and fizz...

CAMERAMAN => Sorry, Damien.'Chris Michael was saying to cut, so we cut-- The AD comes up to the lost looking Damien.
1ST AD =>  I'm gonna have to call it, Damien. Damien is silent, stunned.
1ST AD =>  Okay, that's a wrap for'today. If you are !IN injured, please find the set medic. Speedman, looking as if he had nothing to do with what just happened, walks toward Damien.
SPEEDMAN => I think I got another in me if you want to go again, Damien. Damien looks at the scorched treeline behind them. Speedman looks too, then looks back at Damien.
SPEEDMAN => Your call. In the background, Cody is casually putting out a fire on his lap. He gives an 'I'm O.K.' gesture to no one in particular.
CUT TO => El TELEVISION OPENING GRAPHICS After a flashy montage, JULIE MORAN, the cute El News Daily reporter, walks through the Tropic Thunder set in a halter top, talking to camera:
JULIE => Well, it might look like 1969 here in the tiny Southeast Asian country of Bien Den Phu, but it is 2007, and they are making history. We are here with an E! exclusive, the first look behind the scenes at what Hollywood insiders are calling the most expensive war movie ever produced. It's called "Tropic Thunder", and first time Director Damien Dorfman has assembled an all-star cast to play the forgotten grunts who perished near here more than 35 years ago.
JULIE . => But the last few films have-not "blown up" for Speedntan as he's struggled to broaden his range as an.-actor.. First, an attempt to change gears with a comedy...
JULIE => The disappointing "CHITLIN AND THE DUDE", was followed.with last year's failed venture into serious dramatic territory...
JULIE => ."Simple Jack", the story-of a mentally impaired farm hand who can "talk" to animals was a box office disaster that many critics called one of the worst movies of all time.
SPEEDMAN =>  You mu-mu-muhhh make me'ha-aaaapy.
JULIE =>  But now, the question is can Speedman "mu- mu-make" audiences happy in the true life story of war hero Four Leaf Tayback in "Tropic Thunder". And,' possibly a shot  1. -4416 at that elusive gold statuette?
SPEEDMAN =>  All I want is to make the real Four Leaf here proud. It's his story, he lived it and wrote it in his book. That's why we're here. But really, I mean, how cah we begin to understand what he-- what you --went through? Four Leaf fixes his stoic, steely gaze on the horizon for a beat. He lifts his hands up, and we see he has only two HOOKS. Speedman studies him closely, aping his gestures, trying to "get inside" him as much as possible.
SPEEDMAN => That's great. He's like a... Buddha or something. Maybe I should rub his belly for luck! He laughs, but quickly realizes Four Leaf doesn't find it funny.
JULIE =>  Like for a lucky Oscar nod this time? Maybe you should rub Kirk Lazarus's belly! He already has three! Speedman laughs uncomfortably, trying to seem unperturbed. i "I' 0, nM y
- JULIE => Three time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus, reclusive, brilliant Irishman, considered by many.'the best actor of his generation, and also a known bad boy... Stills of a DRUNKEN LAZARUS outside a New York Bar, punching a paparazzo...
JULIE => . is famous for his total immersion into whatever role he plays. To.transform into the role of the African American Sergeant who saved_Four Leaf's life...
AJULIE => Lazarus-went - to shocking, and controversial lengths...
JULIE => After undergoing experimental pigmentation alteration procedures in a Singapore clinic, this was the startling result.
JULIE => British documentary director Damien Dorfman has never made a theatrical movie before, but his mission, he says, is to bring a reality to the film that he feels is missing from most Hollywood epics.
DAMIEN => My goal, quite simply, is for an audience member to walk out of the cinema, feeling as if they were IN Vietnam for two hours. Quite literally.
REPORTER => Are you intimidated about working with actors for the first time?
DAMIEN => Intimidated?
JULIE => Well, he'll certainly have his hands full with king of comedy Jeff Portnoy.
JULIE => After being arrested for heroin, cocaine and crack possession, Portnoy is out to prove he can. stay clean and get audiences addicted to seeing him in a movie without any potty. humor...
JULIE => And from the world of hip-hop, multi.-- platinum selling rapper, producer, and clothing designer Redykulous, and star of his own hi't reality show "Utterly Redykulous".
REDYKULOUS => As far as Redykulous is concerned, you .know, I 'always believed you've got to exploit every opportunity. He holds up a can of "PYMP SWEAT".
REDYKULOUS => That's why my new sports drink Pymp Sweat is the official beverage on the set of Tropic Thunder, as well as my new energy bar, the "Bust-A-Nut", with all proceeds going to clean up land mines in this previously war ravaged area.
JULIE => At a reported budget north of $200 million, Tropic Thunder could end up costing almost as much as the real war! But the good news for Damien Dorfman and his troops -- the Oscar buzz is already starting! So for El News I'm Julie-- All of a sudden Portnoy, wearing a Tropic Thunder cap all askew and surfer shorts with no shirt, bursts out of the bushes. He screams wildly and GRABS Julie, who cracks up laughing at his "stunt". '
PORTNOY =>  Me so horny!! Me so horny!! He jumps into the pool with her! What a crack up!
DAMIEN => You can't do that Todd.
DAMIEN => Dailies are always bad! Bad dailies, good movie! Isn't that what they say?
DAMIEN => Well, yes, that's exactly-it,.Walter if- you actually came out here you would see that .these actors are--
IN => VOICE OF TODD I will not be called an eco-terrorist, do you understand that? Damien looks a bit bewildered by that. His hot young assistant comes in with a cell phone.
DAMIEN =>  Yes, Chris!?
SPEEDMAN => Hey, Dorf. Just wanted to call and throw a little pep talk your way. I know today was rough, and you're probably mad at yourself for not getting the shots, but that's the way these movies go. We all boot it from time to time, and today was just one of those days. Happens.
DAMIEN =>  Yes it does. It does. Though I do think you have to realize Chris, that you are somewhat responsi--
SPEEDMAN => Oh, also needed to let you know, and I. .know you're like wrapped up with the movie, but I really need that new chef like we talked about, you know to really 4 get that super-ripped thing happening. This guy is great but all he makes are dumplings. And they stiill haven't worked out the TiVo thing. III I. I I 4I
DAMIEN' => Right. well those things... those. 4,
4, => things ...I'm dealing with bigger issues right now Chris --
SPEEDMAN => Yeah, of course, I just know we talked about getting super-super-ripped for that starvation sequence Speedman's other line goes. He sees the caller I.D.
SPEEDMAN => Oh,, shit-- can you hang on a sec, D? He switches over,, but it takes a few seconds with the hooks.
SPEEDMAN => Rick?.
PECK. => Guess what I'm staring at right now?
SPEEDMAN => What?
PECK => I'm looking at your ugly mug on the back of Vanity Fair magazine in beautiful living color with the two cute cuddly pandas from cuteville. It's insane.
PECK => The credibility factor that the pandas give you is priceless, and strangely, if' you see this picture, what really strikes me is the credibility that you give them. I've been getting psychotic feedback all day. Hey did you get the basket I sent? WE SEE: A survival-themed gift basket in a camouflage backpack, There's a satellite phone, camouflage sunblock, etc.
SPEEDMAN => Yeah. Thanks.
PECK => You sad? What's wrong?
SPEEDMAN => No I'm fine. I've just been having a tough time over here. They still havn't got the TiVo hooked up and... I don't know... Lazarus is getting all this Oscar buzz already --
PECK => Is that what this is about? Crazy Kirk Lazarus goes and places his entire body in some experimental Malaysian dipping sauce so he can actually be black, of course he's gonna get buzz. Listen to what I am telling you. He is clinically mentally not right.
SPEEDMAN => Yeah but the way they talk about him. I mean, he played a retarded guy and won an Oscar, I play a retarded guy and don't even get a nomination. I don't know, I mean you said "Simple Jack" would be my "Elf" but with Oscars. Those were your exact words.
PECK => I don't believe those were my exact words but let's get beyond that to the root of this. Remember the moment you chose to do, this', and I wanted you to do the ESP robot thing with Wolfgang Petersen? And I said stay home be happy and you said "no, Rick I need to play a real human being" and I said "okay" and then I said "are you sure?" and you said that you needed this-for your soul?
SPEEDMAN => Yes but --
PECK => Which I totally respected and now you're doing the crazy surfer three..sixty move on me,..which I love by the-way-- but-you said fuck it, I gotta do it for my soul And-that's why I hate you.. Because you were RIGHT. And you're in. the Phuc Long fucking Delta,. in the real mud, with- leeches in your hair, 20,000 mil es from Fatburger.being an actor-And, I would wager, forcing everyone around you to rise to your level. Am I right? I mean you are over there forcing a bunch of PUSSY actors to gel, straighten up and. become a platoon. And it hurts. Am I right? Speedman actually seems tohave bought-this
SPEEDMAN => Yeah. You are right.
PECK => Alright, that's what.I thought. Now get to work genius soldier. I'll handle the .TiVo. Peck hangs up abruptly.
ON SPEEDMAN => Speedman punches the button on his cordless and puts. it down. He ponders Rick's words as he gets caught up watching the end scene of "SIMPLE JACK" on his TV. He has forgotten Damien is on the other line.
DAMIEN => Chris? You there? Hello? Finally, after a few moments of listening to this, Damien explodes. He throws the phone on the ground and jumps up and down on it. He notices the crew staring at him. He tries to look as if that just didn't happen. He opens the sliding glass, and heads straight to the door. He continues walking through his office, out into the main offices. He motions for his assistant to join him.
DAMIEN => Get everyone together! We are having a cast meeting" tonight! No choice! Everyone must attend. I am putting my foot down!
off. => i n  i nM'al WAITERS, dressed like bald Marlon Brandos in full face camo, serve hors d'oeuvres. PORTNOY, not looking very sober, jumps up on the stage with the dancers and starts doing a striptease.
DAMIEN, => Jeff. Jeff are you alright?.We.need to talk -- as.a cast, as a platoon, right now.
PORTNOY =>  Dorfie-- did you happenito see that grip withthe bandana?-The big guy?-I was supposed to meet him here. He has a- package of mine. Kevin Sandusky  comes up to them, looking fresh faced and eager.
SANDUSKY. => Hey Mr. Dorfman. Jeff. You O.K? That was some hit you took today.
SANDUSKY => I'm Kevin. Are you serious? Kevin Sandusky? I'm playing Brooklyn?
PORTNOY => Oh yeah. Right. Hey, have you seen that grip with the bandana?
SANDUSKY => Uh, no. I think-- But Portnoy is off already looking for his drug connection. They both watch him go.
SANDUSKY => Hey, Mr. Dorfman, I was hoping to find you. I know this is a party, but this afternoon after work I was breaking down my M-16, and I have to say, in the night watch scene, a minute and a half is a pretty short amount of time to assemble it.
SANDUSKY => Oh, yeah. Of course. This is a huge opportunity. To be working with all these great actors, and you.
DAMIEN => You're the only one who auditioned. You're the only one who did the two week boot camp, Sandusky.
SANDUSKY => Yeah, I know. It was kind of weird. Wasn't the point that we were all supposed to bond?
SPEEDMAN => I guess I just watched some retarded people. I mean, I spent a lot. of time. with them... watching them.. Watching all the retarded stuff they did.
LAZARUS => Huh, I always found mere observation a little rudimentary. Gotta dig deeper to mine the true emotional,paydirt. Diagram the source of the pain. Then live it.
SPEEDMAN =>  Exactly! With Jack. I was, for the first time in-my life..  Retarded. I was retarded.in.the trailer, retarded at home., Brushing my. teeth retarded. In a `weird way I had to unlearn what it was to be... .NOT retarded.
LAZARUS => Yeah... but Simple Jack thought he was smart. Or, rather, didn't think he was retarded. So you can afford to play retarded', being a smart actor. Tricky tricky stuff. Hats off for going. there. Especially.knowing how the Academy is about that shit. Speedman is lost:
SPEEDMAN => About what?
LAZARUS =>  Are you serious? Everyone knows you don't ever go fully retarded!
SPEEDMAN => How do you mean? Lazarus sets his. drink down. School's in session.
LAZARUS => Check it out. Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man. Looked retarded. Acted retarded. NOT retarded. He could count toothpicks, cheat at cards. Autistic. Sure. NOT retarded. HANKS'. Forest Gump. Slow? Yes.
LAZARUS => You went full retard, man. You never go 14 full retard. Don't believe me? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I am Sam. Went full retard. Went home empty handed. Speedman sees this for the truth it is. How could he be so stupid?
LAZARUS =>  But hey, man! Who knows? Four Leaf could be your ticket to Oscar gold. I'd lose the hook hands though... cripples don't give the Academy wood either.
DAMIEN => Redykulous... I need to talk to you.
REDYKULOUS => What up, money.
DAMIEN =>  We're having a cast meeting, right now We need to come together as a unit -- The camera crew moves in for the close-up. . .making Damien uncomfortable ... Redykulous takes it in stride. Throughout the scene he is TEXT MESSAGING someone.
REDYKULOUS => Uh-huh... Damien is made uncomfortable by the cameraman who has i started manually zooming in and out on him in a dutch style camera move... DAMIEN i Do you mind if we step away for a moment?
REDYKULOUS => From what? Damien tries to indicate the crew.
DAMIEN =>  From the...uh...you know... .this area..
REDYKULOUS => Oh, I see...sure They take a few steps away from the bar... The entire camera crew follows.
DAMIEN => Oh. Hah! No, I mean away from the cameras. you understand?. Away from  them...
REDYKULOUS => No.
DAMIEN => What?
REDYKULOUS => No. I can't do that. If Redykulous steps away from the cameras then my .people don't get to see the real Redykulous. The show is called "Utterly Redykulous".
DAMIEN => Well this is about work ...my show so to. .speak. Do you understand?
REDYKULOUS => I guess. But not really. Your show and my show are the same thing. This is gonna help your show, trust me.
DAMIEN => Excuse me, everyone! If I could have your attention! Nothing. No one notices except Speedman. Damien grabs a couple bottles off the bar and BANGS them together.
DAMIEN => Sorry to break up the party, but I just wanted to call your attention to a cast meeting tonight! Big meeting! Future of the film depends on it!
GODFUCKITI SHIT! => Speedman comes up, placing a calming hook on Damien's shoulder. He steps to the fore.
SPEEDMAN =>  "When... we.'.. put... aside... our... differences... we see we're kind of the same." Within moments, the place settles completely.
SPEEDMAN =>  "When we put aside our differences, we see we're kind of the same. Let's be friends, I know we will do great things together." 
SPEEDMAN => I was looking-at it all backwards. You guys are lost. You heed.me to.lead you, to help you gel, and straighten.up -- like a PLATOON! A long beat.
PORTNOY =>  Hey,. Speedman! That bullshit pep'talk made me.H-h-h-h-h-happy! The entire party cuts.up.in loud hysterics. Speedman looks hurt. The DJ puts on-a Redykulous track really loud, and the, place gets even crazier.
astray.. => Damien turns around., startled. FOUR LEAF is standing eerily in the bushes by the sand.
FOUR LEAF => You don't know which way is up, do you private`? You couldn't find a dixie coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding your prick. and showin' you the way... Damien doesn't know what the fuck that meant. Four Leaf moves to him, staring deep into his eyes. Damien's eyes widen in fear.
FOUR LEAF => A raindrop cannot carve a valley. An ant cannot defeat a buffalo. But a tempest can cleave that mountain to make the valley, and an army of ants can fell the mighty buffalo.
DAMIEN =>  Yes...
FOUR LEAF => If the lion, although king of the jungle, is thrown into the sea, he will drown... but...if...
DO YOU!? => He lunges at Damien and grabs him by the collar with both hooks. '
DAMIEN =>  I want to!!! But not really!!
FOUR LEAF => I put my story in your limp Brit hands and you will not fail me!!  My boys were worse pussies than these guys. But the shit is what made us a unit. A whole. You must put them in the
SHIT. => He releases Damien and takes a large draw on his cigarette...
FOUR LEAF => There's a place. About a hundred clicks from here, as the crow flies. Deep in the jungle. No trailers, no port-a-potties. Nothing but triple canopy jungle and cockroaches the size of melons. Damien seems intrigued yet a little freaked out by his weirdness.
DAMIEN => And...?
FOUR LEAF => Rig up your documentary cameras'in that jungle, give me and Cody a few of those smoke bombs and some charges and we could light up the jungle so those lily-dick actors would think they were in the middle of. Hamburger Hill. You.get them thinking they're getting shot at, and you'll have your movie. Suddenly, Four Leaf slaps his neck with his hook as though he has been bitten. He holds out a small squished mosquito' between the claws of his prosthesis.
FOUR LEAF => You must put them.under your thumb the way this. bug is under mine... .under YOUR control.
DAMIEN => I see ...yes ...They would 'be under my total control... finally. I could shoot the whole movie there. Gritty. Dirty. Away from their pampered pussy posses and helpers...
FOUR LEAF => Yes... yes...
DAMIEN => Put them in the real shit. Film them with real fear in their eyes. REAL FEAR!
YES!! => Damien and Four Leaf share a crazed look. COOL MUSIC UP as WE PUSH IN and...
FOUR LEAF => Save your breath, maggots! They all shrink back. Four Leaf's fierce posture is undercut as the helicopter lurches, sending Damien sprawling onto hire.
DAMIEN => That'sright. Maggots.
GO!!! => Apparently they are not moving fast enough -- Four Leaf and Damien shove the guys out of the chopper onto the ground.
FOUR LEAF => See you in hell! As the noise of the helicopter fades, the group starts. trying to orient itself in their new surroundings.' The Jungle. Black, dense, unforgiving. All around them can be seen the remnants of a war that has been over for thirty years. A grave marker,. half of an old rusted out'downed chopper. All are absorbing the spookiness, except Portnoy who seems very upset.
PORTNOY => This is bullshit! Damien marches over to him, and SLAPS HIM REPEATEDLY in the face.
PORTNOY I => 
CELL PHONES! => Everyone hands over their phones. Speedman, however, turns away from the group, getting his. satellite phone out of the gift bag. He surreptitiously stows it down the front of his pants.
I" => Damien dumps them in a pile and finds a large boulder. HE smashes the phones with a draatic flair. The guys GROAN. Damien turns on them with a crazy gleam in his eye.
DAMIEN => Okay, girls... now that I have your attention, I will tell you fuckfaces what we're doing here. You are no longer actors in a movie. You,are grunts in a war. These men around you are your brothers. The guys look at each other, unhappy.
DAMIEN => Congratulations. You've just landed in "the shit". Your objective is to head north and liberate the village at D'ang Kwook Hill, at which point "Four Leaf" gets himself captured, at which point you rescue him, at which point we will chopper you home. We will also be rigging this entire valley of death with hidden cameras so that every glorious moment gets on film. And believe me it WILL be glorious. If it looks real, chances are good it probably is. You wanted to be actors? You wanted to occupy the skin of another human being? Get ready to occupy the skin of a terrified U.S. Infantry grunt, surrounded by death, crawling up Satan's arsehole. There's going to be enemy fire. Booby traps. Your own personal little slice of the 'Nam. The group shares a look -- "What's going on?" He pulls out a laminated packet.
DAMIEN =>  "Four Leaf", since you're the Captain here, here's the scene list and the map.  Think you can handle it? From now on, Whatever we get on film is our movie, period. Damien pulls out a walkie-talkie.
DAMIEN => THIS is your only link to, the real world. It will be used only in an emergency or to replenish our supplies if absolutely necessary. This is NOT a cell phone. This radio goes'to the chopper, and the chopper ONLY. The chopper is GOD, and I am Jesus Christ his SONI!! You will' depend on and pray 'to US!! And nobody i i n I' IMd4 gets home until we get the shots!  Now... let's'put the greatest war movie ever in the can! With that, Damien marches toward the treeline and'steps on a dormant LAND MINE left sleeping for decades., BLOWING'
SPEEDMAN => Whoa.
CODY => So, I'm thinkin' as soon as Damien gives us the go ahead, we'ust their cherry with a few airbursts, then alpha-alpha till they come running right at, us, then a good of fashioned firefight, maintaining our distance. Four Leaf ignores him, instead looking around the jungle, looking almost lost.
CODY => I been meaning to tell ya the whole shoot. I'm probably one-a your biggest fans. Your book was kinda my "Catcher in the Rye". It inspired me to become a gyro man. Four Leaf gives Cody nothing -- except his usual stoic stare.
CODY => I'm actually sort of a war nut. I mean I never was in the service, but for me blowing shit up in a war films is sort of my way of paying tribute to the real deal. And you sir, are the real deal. Nothing.
CODY => Hey, I was wonderin' what kind of sidearm you carry? Looks to me like a--
FOUR LEAF =>  I don't know what it's called. I just know the sound it makes when it takes a man's life. Cody, a little spooked, picks up his radio.
CODY => Ok, we're ready to rock and roll.  Damien, come in. Cameras are up, ordinance are up. Ready to kick the tires and light the fires on your say so.
PORTNOY => I think he's like... dead.
SPEEDMAN =>  Nice, very nice, Dorf. . .Very nice, wherever you're hiding!
REDYKULOUS => I don't think he's hiding.. I think he just died! Sandusky leans down towards the off screen corpse. pulls a wrist into frame.
SANDUSKY => He doesn't. have a pulse ...or a head. He then grabs a bent and rusty.piece of metal.
SANDUSKY => Must've been one of those Claymore mines. This old Jungle must.be full of them.,
REDYKUZOUS => You bet your ass it is. That's why a percentage of my Pymp Sweat Profits are helpin' solve the problem! Damien's corpse emits a disturbing death rattle. Speedman busts up laughing. They turn to him -- what the hell? Speedman throws an-arm.around Sandusky, -like an indulgent older brother.
SPEEDMAN => C'mon! Don't you get it? This is what .Dorf was talking about -- our slice of the Nam! He's trying to get in our heads!
SPEEDMAN => That whole "life and death" speech in the chopper? He's meshing 'with us! What do you think all that "playing God" was about? The guys breathe a huge collective sigh of relief -- except Lazarus.
LAZARUS => Are you nuts, shithead? The dude is dead!! Sandusky looks unsure. He doesn't want to take sides.
SPEEDMAN => Kirk. I know you're the big fancy actor here, but, no offense, I've done a lot mote effects driven event films, and I think I can spot a prop body.
CODY => -- I repeat, we are now go for mission!
DAMIE-- => The walkie crackles unintelligibly. Speedman picks it up, showing it to the guys. See?
SPEEDMAN =>  I got a baaaad feeling on this one, Fats. The group remains motionless., Speedman gives Portnoy a ,M in MAIM "c'mon!" type look. Portnoy doesn't know what he means...
SPEEDMAN => I said, I got a baaad feeling on this one, Brooklyn... Oh! He's acting! Sandusky hesitantly takes the cue, and starts walking. stealthily around.with him, on high.alert.for Charlie. Swinging his gun unpredictably.
SANDUSKY =>  Me too, cap'n.
SPEEDMAN => Naw, man. I know you ain't crazy Brooklyn...
SANDUSKY => Well,. if I told you that I, I never actually, well, been with a girl...you wouldn't, like, think I was, like, queer .or nothin'... would you.?
SPEEDMAN => .Naw, man... I wouldn't think you was a queer.
,I => Tropic Thunder 45.
I" => Redykulous shrugs and joins in, too:
REDYKULOUS => (acting really "black guy"
SCARED) => Sh...sh...shit ...When I get back to the world, I'm gonna find me the finest piece of Detroit nubian mugambo, and fuck it till I broke its back.
PORTNOY => The last "mugambo" you ever tasted was in your momma's soup bowl. I wouldn't mind slurpin' on a little of that --
SPEEDMAN => That's enough outta you Fats. Don't you worry, Brooklyn. You gotta lotta days a fucking ahead of you and I for one ain't gonna let Charlie... Lazarus can't handle it anymore.
LAZARUS => What the FUCK is wrong with you people?! Speedman shoots him a look then takes a few steps back. He addresses the treeline.
SPEEDMAN => Sorry Damien! Back to one... action!  Don't you worry, Brooklyn, You gotta
LAZARUS => Yo, asshole! Mothafucka just DIED! Speedman sighs, annoyed.
SPEEDMAN => How many more takes you wanna wreck? Some of us are taking this seriously. Lazarus looks likes he wants to explode. But instead he becomes eerily calm. He begins an impressive transformation -- Everything except for his skin color returns to his real identity, a pompous Irish prick.
LAZARUS =>  Jaysus! There isn't going to be any movie, ya gobshite!
PORTNOY => i Wow. That was really cool.
THE GUERILLAS => Are watching this, poised to attack.
SPEEDMAN => Excuse me Kirk, I think you dropped something. He mimes picking something , off, the ground.
SPEEDMAN => It's called your character. Don't worry, I won't tell the Academy! Suddenly: GUNFIRE FROM EVERYWHERE! The Guerrillas have seized the moment. The actors all immediately hit the dirt, except for Speedman,.who just looks annoyed and blase as dirt and debris kicks up all around him.
SPEEDMAN => You happy now? We're out of position for the effect! Am I the only one who read .the script?! This is the ambush! A tree aboveSpeedman gets hit, explodes, sprays chunks of wood and shrapnel everywhere.
SANDUSKY => I think they're really shooting at us!
SPEEDMAN => What are you guys worried about? These guys are pros. The unions would tear them a new ass-if any of us got hurt. The actors stay down, looking scared.
SPEEDMAN => Come on, you guys! Let's use this!
FOUR LEAF => Hear that? Cody is preoccupied with the radio and the explosives.
CODY => What? I still can't get Damien on the radio. I bet he forgot how to use the Walkie again. What do you say we get a little... pro-active? Cody, very excited, grabs a plunger.
ON CODY => He pushes down the plunger...
CODY => Right on!! I bet Damien heard that!. Cody turns to Four Leaf, and finds himself staring straight at 10 GUERILLA FIGHTERS with their submachine guns pointed straight at them.
CODY => Oh shit.
FOUR LEAF => Oh yeah. And with that Cody and Four Leaf are.RIFLE BUTTED out of consciousness...
REDYKULOUS => That was some sick shit! I wasn't even thinking bout the camera! The guys' adrenaline is flowing, they do high fives all around. Lazarus is not happy. He looks off into the jungle, sensing that someone was out there.
SANDUSKY' => So what do we do now? Speedman pulls out the map, frowns at it.
SPEEDMAN => Damien said to head north. I'm guessing they've got more of these "battles" and Viet Congs rigged for uls on the way.  Alright, let's hump-our shit to D'ang Kwook! Let's didi double time! We got a lot of clicks to cover! Speedman heads off into a particularly dense section of jungle. After a beat, he reappears, looking a little lost.
SANDUSKY => Uh...Sir, isn't it that way? Kevin points in the other direction. Speedman glances down at the map, which he rotates around, right side up now.
SPEEDMAN => Oh yeah. Thanks, uh...
SANDUSKY =>  Kevin. Kevin Sandusky.
SPEEDMAN => Right. Okay, To D'ang Kwook! Lets do-it- to-it! Everyone follows Speedman. Lazarus, very reluctantly, brings up the rear, still looking off into the jungle. A
PORTNOY => So... we're just supposed to keep walking?
SPEEDMAN => We'll see some action soon enough. And try to stay in character. We're on camera..
PORTNOY => What do you mean "soon"?
,I => Tropic Thunder 51.
SPEEDMAN => Whenever Damien decides it's time, I guess.
PORTNOY => When's that?
SPEEDMAN => I don't know. That's the whole point. Damien wants us tired and confused.
REDYKULOUS => Yeah, well I'm definitely qualifying for those objectives. Everyone chimes in -- they all need a break. Lazarus notices the mutinous vibe and smiles.
SPEEDMAN => Fine, fine. Okay, let's take a break, but be on the lookout for anything. Charlie doesn't care if you're on a break or not. Speedman plunks down and opens the map. He seems puzzled. Lazarus eyes him suspiciously. Sandusky walks off to take a leak. Lazarus then watches him go. Off to the side, Sandusky starts to pee. He hears something rustle next to him.
LAZARUS => Psst. Hey. Sandusky turns to see Lazarus peeing uncomfortably close to him.
LAZARUS => Speedman is watching. I don't have much time. I don't really need to piss. I need to talk to you. You went to the boot camp Sandusky, right? You can read that map?
SANDUSKY => Yeah...
LAZARUS => Good, good. Speedman is a tosser. That hoor's melt really thinks this is a movie. And he's got the lot of ya convinced.
SANDUSKY => You saying you don'tithink they're filming us?
LAZARUS => Of course not! It's only a matter of time before he walks us into more mines or more of whoever the hell was shootin', at us. That muppet's going to get us all killed. I need to convince everyone.to turn around, but I .can't do it without the map. You're the only one who can read it. Can I count on you?
SANDUSKY => Well, yeah, I.guess. But
LAZARUS => Good man, Good man. Lazarus makesa big show of pretending he's done peeing, shaking, etc.., and heads back to the group. Speedman eyes Lazarus. What is he up to? Sandusky is just getting comfortable, begins to pee again. He hears another rustle. He turns.to see Speedman, right next to him.
SPEEDMAN => I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you. Speedman surreptitiously takes out a can of Pymp Sweat and sticks the tip of his Bowie knife into it, to create a red pee.stream.
SPEEDMAN => Lazarus is insane. He's freaking out, and. he's gonna.ruin the whole movie for all of us. The men respect you, because you went to boot camp and rehearsal.  And you're pretty handy with that map. I need you on my side, Kyle.
SANDUSKY => Kevin.
SPEEDMAN- => If you stick with the program, I'm gonna talk to some of the Dreamworks brass... there'll probably be a Teen Choice award in it for you. You have that potential.
SANDUSKY => Well, I --
SPEEDMAN => Good man. Good man. Speedman rejoins the group, gives Lazarus a cocky look.
SPEEDMAN => If we stay on this trajectory we should be reaching the village any minute now. At the end of the line, we hear a few groans emanating from Portnoy.
SPEEDMAN => Buck up,, Fats ...we got a long road ahead of us...
REDYKULOUS =>  Yeah, I'd like to check out some of those "meds" for my own self. Lazarus moves up to Speedman.
LAZARUS => Look, ya eejit, I mean, if there was a village don't you think we would have hit it by now?
SPEEDMAN => Quit your carping, we're right where we're supposed to be!
LAZARUS => . Hey, Is there a feckin' river on that map? S.pee`dman refers to the'now sopping wet map.
SPEEDMAN => Yes! There is! Its just a little more' down to the... lefty-down part from the: village.  Anyway,. this feels like the Sampan, Boat Raid at the end of the second act.
LAZARUS => I don't see a "Sampan" boat!
SPEEDMAN => Any second now one should come by. Alright men, into the water! Everyone'except Lazarus reluctantly gets into the water. They all hold their rifles above their heads.
LAZARUS I => - L-et-'-s-stop this-char-ade-,sha-l-l-we? We need to quit faffin' about and turn. around NOW! And... Lazarus grabs Sandusky.
LAZARUS => Sandusky agrees. with me. Don't you, Sandusky? Kevin is caught, not sure what to d
SPEEDMAN => Wait! First of all... Now Speedman grabs him.
SPEEDMAN => Kelvin believes in this movie. And, second, need I remind you,. I am your superior officer.
LAZARUS => No, yer an actor. Arid if memory serves, a pretty shite one. The actors react -- Damn! Oh Snap! Shit! Speedman steels' himself.
SPEEDMAN => THAT'S THE WAY OUT! That's our only chance!
PORTNOY => Yeah, but maybe we should stay here until they send help! Or maybe try to get back to the hotel.
SPEEDMAN => Help from where! Need I remind you that Damien's orders were to --  --stay in character.  Now, I already have an international box office presence, but for some of you, I'm guessing you might not want to screw this movie up! This actually seems to affect the actors. Lazarus can't believe it.
SPEEDMAN => .okay...C'mon, boys! This way. Let's go get those Viet Congs! Lazarus throws down his gun. He's had it.
LAZARUS => Jay-sus Fuck! It's Viet Cona! Not Viet Congs! Viet Cong, you plunker! And, hey, if you're so sure of yourself, why don't you let Kelvin have a look at the map?! Kevin doesn't know what to do -- he doesn't want to get in the middle of this. Speedman continues to be the tough guy.
SPEEDMAN => Be my guest. Speedman hands over the soggy map. Kevin looks. After a long beat...
SANDUSKY => We've been going the wrong way. 'We were supposed to be doing this: Sandusky traces his finger along the correct route -- a clearly marked, northward arrow.
SANDUSKY => instead, we did this. i I 1d Iv I. 11M% Sandusky draws a line due East --..into a. section of the. map clearly marked with scary skull and cross-bone type 14 % warnings.
PORTNOY =>  Oh, man, this is not' cool, this is not cool at all. Speedman grabs the map back from Sandusky.
SPEEDMAN => I can't believe you people!. You're pussing out on me? We are supposed to be a unit!
LAZARUS => No one is "pussing out." They just prefer not. to die.out here. Sandusky, can you get'us back to the landing zone without the map?
SANDUSKY => It might be tricky, but maybe.
LAZARUS => Okay, which is it, gentlemen? Playin' war with Mister Box Office? Or staying alive?
SPEEDMAN => Unbelievable!. Are you guys really gonna abandon this movie? A long tense. beat -- finally, Sandusky walks towards Lazarus. Everyone follows him. Speedman looks stunned. After a moment, he shakes his head and begins crossing the river, holding his rifle with both hands over his head.
SPEEDMAN => So that's the way it,,is, huh? Fine! I'll finish the movie alone! (turns to Lazarus, under his
BREATH) => And when I give my acceptance speech, I'll be sure to thank you, Lazarus, for staying out of that scene. And come Oscar night, we'll see who feels a little "full retard"! He reaches the other side of the river.
SANDUSKY => Chris, You have no idea where you're going!
SPEEDMAN => Yeah, I do!  I'm going to "EX'S. JUNGLE. DUSK. FOUR LEAF PINNED DOWN AND ALONE". And, I can shoot it alone. They'watch him trudge into the foliage. U2'S "BULLET THE BLUE SKY" comes up as the men watch Speedman disappear...
CLOSER => Speedman walks through the scary jungle, exhausted. He is tired, lonely and hungry. The jungle is making all sorts of terrifying noises. Finally he stops and regards the treeline.
SPEEDMAN => DORF!...CODY?!...What's the deal with a meal break? Are they gonna chopper stuff in later on? I don't wanna be a prima donna or anything, but, we gotta eat, right?
PORTNOY => Uhhh... .UHHHHHHHH.
PORTNOY =>  Ohhh GOD! Is'anybody BOILING!? It's like a sweat lodge out here!
LAZARUS => Make a note gentlemen,. unwittingly, Jeffrey Portnoy is joining the proud ranks of those of us who have suffered for art.  A new frontier for you, Funny Man. When this is all over, you might have more than flatulence to offer an audience. Portnoy looks a little hurt.
REDYKULOUS => You know what? I think I actually liked you better when you were a nigga.
LAZARUS => You know, Redykulous', I respect what it is you do, the rapping, the rhyme-talking -- invented by the Irish I might add.
REDYKULOUS => "Why"?! I dunno...maybe because they had one good part for a black man in this movie and they gave it to a white guy.
LAZARUS => Oh...I see...Put another way -- you're mad because I can act "black" better than you can.
SANDUSKY => Take it easy guys...
REDYKULOUS =>  You better rein in 'black like me' over here, before I put a foot in his white ass...
LAZARUS => Niggaz always got to be niggaz. This is truly over the line. Redykulous lunges at Lazarus. They fight. Redykulous throws a wide punch, that Lazarus deftly avoids, that hooks Portnoy right in the jaw. Sandusky jumps in and pries them apart.
SANDUSKY => Okay! That's enough! Jesus Christ! It's not enough we have people shooting at us! Now we have to kill each other?! Let's pull it together! This place is full of land mines! Or doesn't anyone's sense memory recall our director being blown up by onel? That shut them up.
LAZARUS => Sandusky is right... we could all learn a little from his common sense approach. From now on we walk Indian style, footstep upon footstep. Sandusky. . .you take first position. He breaks off a branch, and hands it to Sandusky, and pushes him out front. Sandusky gives him a look.
LAZARUS => Your bravery shames us. Sandusky reluctantly starts down the path, tapping for land mines with the branch. The guys follow at a VERY safe distance. CLOSE. ON Speedman's face. After a beat.a drop of water hits him in the.forehead. Then another. PULL BACK to reveal a pathetic shelter made. out of headphone. wire, and the In Style magazine.' The drip-is now becoming full on RAIN. He clutches an Equal packet and. the Cherry Chapstick. Gently, he puts the chapstick-to his face and takes a tentative bite, as though he were eating human flesh. He then tears open the Equal packet and empties its contents into his hand,.and takes. a lick, savoring every granule. He hears a rustling in the bushes across from him. A rodent? Food? Excited, he pulls out his Bowie knife and begins to stalk his prey. Now another movement behind.the bush, and a flash of. fur... Stealthily, he moves towards it. With cat like quickness, and knife drawn, he lunges onto the bush, A HUGE ROAR is heard...
hold... => He reels around screaming.and stabbing wildly, brutally pummeling his attacker. He is. covered in blood, but looks ecstatic.
SPEEDMAN => Die! Die, you son of a bitch! Die! Speedman deals a death blow. And unleashes a primal VICTORY SCREAM. Spent, he finally gets a good look at his victim: A.small, cute, cuddly PANDA... Speedman looks horrified...
,i => ,Tropic Thunder 61.
I" 1 => FLASH on a SERIES OF STILLS from SPEEDMAN'S PANDA PHOTO
SHOOT... => He stumbles back against a tree. Suddenly we hear an odd VIBRATING SOUND. He jumps, and - frantically jams his hands in his pants it is the forgotten satellite phone he hid there way back when.
RICK => I got the personal attache of Bien Den Phu's ambassador to the United Nations of America delivering a TiVo directly to your bedroom. But the bad news is you gotta sit down and have monkey brains with him or some ceremonial shit for the local paper.
RICK => A hooker? You killed a hooker? Calm down, it's fine. This is a no-brainer. Thank GOD you're out of the country.
SPEEDMAN => No! A Panda! I killed a panda!
RICK => You WHAT? Uhy. Heavy shit National Park. Oh jeesus...take a breath.. .did anybody see you?
RICK => Chill zone, buddy, 1im thinking. Did anyone see you do this?
SPEEDMAN => I don't think so. I'm out in.the bush. Alone.
RICK => Alright. Listen to me. I want.you to.get your hands on some-bleach, some hydrogen peroxide and some lime. Your gonna wanna cut the body in quarters ... the femurs are gonna be a bitch... that's normal... Speedman'nods eagerly, absorbing it all, not noticing a
RICK => Chris? Breathe.! It's gonna be ok.. I'm calling that publicist right now, the one J Lo hired when she was'hammered and killed that kid with her Jetski. A guerilla shoots the phone. They quickly tie Speedman.up and whisk him'off into the jungle.
SPEEDMAN =>  Alright. P.O.W camp. Scene 67..Bring it on Dorf.
CODY => Where are we?
FOUR LEAF => In a detention hut. And they got Speedman...
CODY => What? Why? We gotta get outta here! Are they gonna kill us? Four Leaf turns on him, grabbing him with one of his hooks.
FOUR LEAF => Pull it together private! Shut your trap before you get us killed! You understand me , lilydick? ! Cody backs off, still scared.
BYONG => What were you doing in our poppy fields?
BYONG => Who sent you here?
SPEEDMAN => You bastard.
BYONG => What? just thought you might like. some...
SPEEDMAN => Corporal Four Leaf Tayback. And oh. yeah. . .THIS is from my uncle... SAM! He HEAD BUTTS Byong in the face,. sending him reeling into the back wall. Beat.
SPEEDMAN =>  You.ok? You leaned into it, man.orry.
of-a marsh. => He looks around, impressed with the production design. He looks up,.sees another security camera observing him. He turns it on.
SPEEDMAN => May God protect you from the mighty arm of the 51st Tropic Thunder to the end! My men will seek you out and mete. out a cruel justice!- Byong and the guards look at him, a bit confused.
SANDUSKY => I think he's dead. A wet fart seeps out of Portnoy.
REDYKULOUS => No. Just smells like hens dead. Smelled
44M => like that all night.
LAZARUS => What's wrong with him?
PORTNOY => If we can work out some rig to carry m? I think it might subside in a little bit... No one touches him.
LAZARUS => Alright. Sandusky? Sandusky looks up at him. Is he serious?
SANDUSKY => What?
LAZARUS => You and Redykulous are gonna have to carry Portnoy. God help you. He marches off.
SANDUSKY => God help me?
REDYKULOUS => God help him that bitch ever find his blackface minstrel show ass alone with me in the real world. Redykulous and Sandusky shake their heads and gather up Portnoy on a make shift stretcher.
stretcher. => They look exhausted. As they crest. the ridge, Redykulous spots something. ''I , I n n4N11
REDYKULOUS => Look! From behind, Sandusky grabs him and forces him to the ground.
SANDUSKY => SHH! Everybody down! The guys hit the dirt. Lazarus crawls up to join them. He pulls out his binoculars, and surveys the scene.
BINOCULAR POV => It is the Flaming Dragon compound...
" LAZARUS => Fook me! I knew it!
-SANDUSKY => Knew what?
LAZARUS => "EXT. P.O.W. PRISON CAMP -- DAY"! Oranges and Lemons,,, the bells of St. Clements. Speedman was right. We 'are shooting the movie. Sandusky grabs the binoculars and starts'looking...
LAZARUS => , How could I be so stupid.
SANDUSKY => I don't think so... . looks to me like some sort of heroin processing plant. Look at the cooking vats, and the guards. Sandusky continues looking through the binoculars.
LAZARUS => How do you know all,this?
SANDUSKY => It was a long trip. I read the in-flight magazine. We're in the Golden Triangle, the biggest drug producer in the world. Uh-oh.
BINOCULAR POV => It is SPEEDMAN, who is being dipped in and out of the water in his bamboo cage, while a bunch of guards stand around and laugh. Whenever he comes up for air, he is
CUT!1 => 
LAZARUS => What do you see?
SANDUSKY => It doesn't look good. Lazarus grabs the binoculars.
LAZARUS => Sweet Mother of Jaysus. Suddenly: GUNFIRE ERUPTS ALL AROUND! A BAND OF GUERILLAS have spotted them and are running at them, firing automatic weapons... The guys scream, and start a frantic retreat down the hill. Portnoy suddenly gets well enough to run out of his stretcher for dear life... In fact, he is actually beating them down the hill.. .when suddenly WHUMP! He falls into a PIT!
PORTNOY => Ow! Fuck Dude! What the fuck?! He screams in pain! Finally, WHUMP!! He disappears into the'hole. REDYKULOUS whistles for the guys to join him, and they all pile into the hole.
HOLE => Footsteps can be heard above leaving the area. Sandusky lights a match. Portnoy is weeping in pain.
SANDUSKY => Must be one of those underground tunnels. The-cou-ntr-y-is-l-itte-red-with them. Je-f-f must have found one of the entrances,:. Portnoy is on his side in pain, whimpering.
PORTNOY => My ass...I think I took one in the ass...
SANDUSKY => Lemme see... Sandusky rolls him.over, and off camera, helps him remove his pants... All the guys recoil in horror.
SANDUSKY => How did it get infected so fast? More ad libs of disgust...
SANDUSKY' => Okay Jeff...This is gonna hurt like hell, but I have to take my finger and see how deep the slug is, and if I can dig it out. Take a breath. Redykulous, hold his hand... Beat... Sandusky puts his hand off camera.
PORTNOY => Hey Dude! What are you doing! Cut it out! That's not the bullet hole. The bullet hole is over here! It dawns on the guys that they have NOT been looking at the bullet hole. Ad-libs of even MORE disgust.
SANDUSKY => OH! my bad. You just got grazed. You're gonna be fine.
arriving. => Finally, the unseen leader emerges. He is a LITTLE BOY, no older than 12 years old, but has the eyes of a killer. He smokes a cigar. This is TRAN. He stops in front of Speedman, staring him down. Then, in a show of alpha male dominance, he tears his shirt off, revealing an impressive set of gruesome tattoos -- a flaming dragon raping a monkey, raping a skull, raping a rat. He holds a stick.
YOUR COMPATRIOTS!. => Tran points across the courtyard where... A"4 Iv I. InM y CODY AND FOUR LEAF ARE MARCHED OUT. Cody looks scared out. of his mind. Speedman takes this in. Traci nods, and TWO GUARDS start to BEAT THE BEJEESUS out of Cody and Four Leaf. Then Tran gets out his own stick and starts to BEAT SPEEDMAN...
SPEEDMAN => No! Puh-Puh-pulease don't h-h-h-hurt them... I Tran cocks his head curiously. He stops beating him..He signals.for the guards to stop beating the others. A long beat.
TRAN => Say that. again.,
SPEEDMAN => Please don't hurt them?I
TRAN => No...like you did before! Silence.
SAY IT! => He threatens to hit him, Speedman recoils.
SPEEDMAN => Puh-puh-puhlease don't h-h-hurt them? A hush falls over the crowd. Tran'seyes widen.
TRAN'S ENTOURAGE => Nyam nook snep jawk...
SPEEDMAN => Please! Excuse me, What are you saying?
TRAN => Nyam nook snep Jawk!  You are Simple Jack?
SPEEDMAN => What? You.. You saw Simple Jack?
TRAN => We love the tale of this man, Simple Jack. Tran snaps his fingers, and an assistant shows Speedman a battered VHS BOX OF SIMPLE JACK. Speedman looks lovingly at it.
TRAN => We do not have many luxury here. Simple Jack is the only movie we possess. We have watched it many, many times. How is the word? Genius? Speedman smiles big. They smile back at him. It's a small world after all.
BODYGUARD =>  You should have got Oscar.
SPEEDMAN => Thanks. I mean even just the nomination...
TRAN => You were nominated?
SPEEDMAN => No, I mean it is great to.be nominated,.. if you are, or that's what I hear. Whatever. It's a popularity contest. It's totally political, you have to lobby for like a year for it...
TRAM => SHUT UP NOW. ilia i n nMd
SPEEDMAN => No problem. So are you going to let me go?
TRAN => No. We will hold.you,for ransom.--.much more money now.. He pulls out a cell phone.
TRAM => Is it possible to.have picture?
SPEEDMAN => Oh, sure, absolutely. Speedman tries to throw an arm around Tran, a guard grabs the arm., and twists it back. Speedman shrieks in pain.
TRAN => You mustn't touch me. The guard snaps the picture.
ABODYGUARD => That came out really good.
TRAN => Now, do the movie.
SPEEDMAN => Excuse me?
TRAN => Do the movie.
SPEEDMAN => The whole movie?
TRAN => Yes. Begin.
SPEEDMAN => Hey, I know you're big fans and that's
GREAT-- => Tran smacks Speedman in the, head with a rifle butt. Speedman crumples to the ground. The crowd cheers.
OW!! => Tran stands over him, screaming into his face:
SWINE!1 => Speedman gets up, begins a scared, unenthusiastic
SPEEDMAN => Aww, puh-puh-Pa! Whu-why you guh-got to muh-muh-make ffffffun of me?
TRAN => More stupid!
SPEEDMAN => Awww, puh-puh-paaaa... Tran turns to one of his men
TRAN => Get him some overalls! And give him the Simple Jack haircut!
SANDUSKY => It looks clear, but I can't be sure. I say we stay in here till it's dark.
REDYKULOUS => I can't believe this is how it ends for Redykulous. I'm a triple platinum recording artist., Shit.
PORTNOY =>  I gotta get back to the hotel. I'm not gonna make.it...
SANDUSKY => Forget it. That guard patrol knows we're out'here. They'll be looking for us. Anyway, Speedman's in that compound. And no one else knows but us.
LAZARUS => That's right. So here's the plan. Everyone leans forward expectantly.
LAZARUS => We sneak out of here, make our way back to the hotel and once we're safe, we alert the government of Speedman's situation.
REDYKULOUS => Sounds good.
SANDUSKY => Whoa whoa whoa ... . wait! So, we're just gonna leave him here?
REDYKULOUS => Yeah, and I don't wanna spend another minute getting the full on smell'o vision in this hole with his stinky ass. Everyone agrees. They start packing up. Sandusky looks horrified. SANDUSKY Au II4 WAIT! Look, I don't think I've met a more wildly self involved human than Speedman, but you're just gonna leave him here? I mean, come on. He's a person, guys. These drug lords are killers. I mean, they eat their enemies. We leave him alone now, he doesn't have a chance in hell.
LAZARUS, => That tosser is in there because of his own stupidity. As far as I'm concerned, he brought it on himself.
REDYKULOUS => Besides, how could we possibly rescue him? Get real, Sandusky, we don't know what the fuck we doing out here.
SANDUSKY => We've gotten this far. Look, we're making a movie about one of the greatest rescues ever. It's a true story,, right? I mean, those guys weren't superheroes! They were just put in extra-ordinary circumstances, and they rose to the occasion.
PORTNOY => Yeah, but they were trained soldiers. They knew how to take care of themselves.
SANDUSKY => And we don't? They believed they could do it. They believed in each other. Look, I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.
REDYKULOUS => You mean, like, not on the same flight? Sandusky just looks at them. They know that is not what he meant.
SANDUSKY => Jeff -- I know this is really hard for you,.but you're gonna have to kick some time, and it might as well be now.  Kirk, I've always admired you as an actor. But as a person, I have to say, not that impressive.' You got a.few Oscars. Got any balls? Lazarus takes this in.
SANDUSKY => Redyk. Whadda.you say? You talk a good game, but how's it gonna feel when you're sipping Cristalle with your homies.in the hot tub back in.Cali knowing you left.a man to die back here? You gonna rhyme about that? , There is a long beat.
REDYKULOUS => Shit. I only wish they was filming this for my show. I'm in. He looks to LazaruS.,Lazarus takes a long dramatic pause.. Then...
LAZARUS =>  We could fooster about for donkey's years..Let:'s quit acting the maggot and nix that mentaller. The guys look at each other. What did that mean?
LAZARUS. => I'm in!
RICK =>  Chris? What is this craziness?
SPEEDMAN => Hi, Rick. It's Chris--
RICK => Chris?
BYON G => Yes, that was Chris. But you will not speak with him again. And do not bother trying to trace this call.
RICK => What's going on? Who is this?
BYONG => We are Flaming Dragon. Speedman is with us now. There is a long silence as Rick processes this. Then he nods slowly.
RICK => Oh. Really. Well I never heard of your little agency. But if you wanna poach my client? Lemme tell you something. His career's been in a death spiral since Simple Jack, so why don't you all go fuck yourselves! Oh, and I bet he hasn't even told you about the whole panda thing! He killed a panda! And next time you're at a cocktail party with Paris Hilton, or at Kate Mantellini's choking down some egg whites with Ron Howard, DON'T LET THAT SLIP, because chances are, I ALREADY DID! Rick slams the phone down.
LAZARUS => Jaysus! We're too late. They brained him! REDYKULOUS grabs the binoculars. Sees for himself.
REDYKULOUS => He's right, man, that ain't right. Messin' with a man's brain.
SANDUSKY => We gotta get him outta there...
SANDUSKY' => Here's us. Here's the compound.Here's where Speedman was. It looks like they move him at night, cause he's not here now. Unfortunately we have no idea what the layout of that place is.
PORTNOY =>  I got an idea. Everyone turns to Portnoy.
PORTNOY => It might be a little crazy, but...
REDYKULOUS => Crazy is better than nothin'.
SANDUSKY => What is it?
PORTNOY =>  Back in '98, I did a low budget titty comedy for skinemax, "Sex Camp". Anyway, me and the campers from the uncool camp had to break into the rich girls' camp. So we did it by building a catapult. They shot us over the wall and we parachuted down. The guys all look at each other... then finally:
LAZARUS => That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.
SANDUSKY => Yeah. Sorry Portnoy. That's lame. I say we wait till just before dawn and sneak over the fence. Take our chances. You guys ok with that? The group nods in approval.
SANDUSKY => Good. Then let's get some rest. Me and Redyk are on first watch.  I'll wake you in two hours, and we'll switch. They break up. Portnoy comes up to Sandusky, extremely freaked out.
PORTNOY => I'm not gonna make it.
SANDUSKY => Yes you are.
PORTNOY => Then you gotta tie me up. I'm serious. Tie me to a tree. No matter how much I scream, or however much-I plead, you.must not untie me. I will be cunning, I will be in pain, and Iwill lie. The devil works this way. I will say, do, and excrete many regrettable things. But.no matter what.. .you must leave me alone. Beat..
SANDUSKY => Okay.. .Lazarus, you heard him. Tie him up. We'll get you through it.
BODYGUARD =>  Jack...I could never go -to the county ho- down with you. I would be laughed out of town. And what would Chet say? The bodyguards laugh woodenly at Speedman.
SPEEDMAN => B-b-b-b-but I am a G-g-g-ggggoood Dd-d-d- d-dancer. Speedman bows, exhausted and exhilarated. The old women .politely applaud. A new group forms in front of his cage. Speedman stands. He sighs, and begins the movie over again...
SPEEDMAN => Shu-sure is a puh-puh-purty sssssssunrise, uh-uh-uh-uh-ain't it?
BODYGUARD => Go do your chores, slowpoke!!
window. => 11l I I, I. Inti"
FOUR LEAF => That poor bastard. Looks like they coo- coo nested him.
FOUR LEAF => What plan?
CODY => To get us out of here? Come on man, yoi4 lived this, you gotta have an idea of how we can get out of here? Right? Four Leaf looks a little at a loss...
FOUR LEAF =>  Sometimes the flowing stream can only move when... the water... dries up.
CODY => No offense, but what the hell does that mean?
FOUR LEAF => It means I'm,sick of your yappin'!
CODY => Come on man, you heard him back there. They wanna off us! We gotta escape! You
GOTTA-- => Four Leaf suddenly puts his hook hand right up to Cody's neck. Cody instinctively blocks it with his hand.
FOUR LEAF => I gotta what? Take on the whole compound by myself!
CODY => Stop it man! You're chokin' me!
CODY => AHH! Who the hell are you? Four Leaf looks down, sheepishly.
SANDUSKY => Wow... .look at all those stars. Makes a guy feel pretty small.
REDYKULOUS => Yup.
SANDUSKY => Back in LA, we don't get stars like this. I wonder why there are so many here?
PORTNOY => Ohhhh...jeeesssusss..it's horrrrible.:...
REDYKULOUS => Man, how can;, you be talking about stars? We might not make it outta here tomorrow.
SANDUSKY => I don't know. I give us pretty good odds. Redykulous looks at'his watch, and lets out a chuckle.
SANDUSKY => What's so funny?
REDYKULOUS => Nothin'..
PORTNOY => .I can't feel my legs!...
REDYKULOUS => I'm just thinking about Lill Kantankerous Bitch.
SANDUSKY => Who?
REDYKULOUS => She's a rapper I'm producing, a twelve year old girl. Her first single drops tomorrow and I'm not even gonna be there to see it.
PORTNOY => Ohhhhh GOD! THERE'S BARBED WIRE IN MY
REDYKULOUS => I pulled her off the streets six months ago.
SANDUSKY => You did that?
REDYKULOUS => Well, not literally, she was trapped in a dead end record deal with Rick Rubin. Didn't even have a lawyer. Huh. And here I am on the other side of the world. About to die for a guy I barely even know. Makes Redykulous wonder what's it all about.
SANDUSKY => Yeah. . .well at least you have someone to think about.
REDYKULOUS => You single?
SANDUSKY => Yeah,... .I guess. I dunno. I got a girl. But it's not too serious.
SANDUSKY => I don't think we're in love.
PORTNOY => Ohh... . thank God...its Over ...it's finally over...
SANDUSKY => It'.s kind of depressing. That feeling of not having anyone who really loves you.. Redykuloils. puts his arm around Sandusky to comfort him..
REDYKULOUS => Hey, it's cool.. I think you're extremely lovable. Weird silence.
SANDUSKY => What?
REDYKULOUS =>  I mean like ...like,. I know what you mean. I have love problems myself!
SANDUSKY => .No you don't. What would the great Redykulous, know about Girl Problems. You're ten girls deep 24 hours a day!
REDYKULOUS => .That's the problem. Silence.
SANDUSKY => How do you mean?
PORTNOY => OHH GOOD!!!1 make it stop! ... .Pahllleeeeeese!
REDYKULOUS => Jeesus, I can't believe I'm gonna tell you this... Beat.
REDYKULOUS => I'm... .I like guys.
SANDUSKY => What? But...
PORTNOY => Ohh...phew...
REDYKULOUS => I know-impossible huh. That's what I say sometimes, but its true. Talk abort living a loveless life. At least you have someone who loves you. I don't even have that.
PORTNOY => 
REDYKULOUS => When I think of the nights, alone in my penthouse, when I've longed for the gentle touch of another dude, to feel his skin against mine, or his sweet breath on my face.
SANDUSKY => All this from the same guy who wrote"Niggaz Gotta Bust a Nut on a Ho".
REDYKULOUS => Yeah, well, let me let you in on a big secret.
SANDUSKY => So what! You're gay! You're also a great artist and-businessman ... why not rap about that? u I I. 11jm
REDYKULOUS => Yeah right. And watch my clothing line, e4 sports drink,jewelry, nutrition, bars, and fragrances go south? It's all such a lie. Now he begins to cry .a. little. Sandusky embraces him.
SANDUSKY. => Shhh...shhh... .shhh..shhh..shhh... .That's it...let it out.
REDYKULOUS => (muffled, crying in his
SHOULDER) => If you tell anyone I'll have someone shoot your. ass.
SANDUSKY => I'm not gonna tell anyone, and your not gonna shoot me... .th-at's it...l-et -tout. Redykulous pulls back, and collects himself.
REDYKULOUS => Aww shit...  I can't. believe it's possibly the last day of my life, and I'm not even gonna be able to let my fans know how truly 'Utterly Redykulous I really am.
SANDUSKY =>  Listen, I know how utterly Redykulous you are. Even for just.thisone moment. . .and sometimes that enough.
REDYKULOUS => Thanks man.
CODY => So all of "Tropic Thunder" is bullshit?
FOUR LEAF => No! Four Leaf and his men were real, it happened!
CODY => Are you even a VET!?
FOUR LEAF => YES! Well ...no! I mean, kinds! Yeah! Not exactly. I served honorably in what they called the "forced service". Sanitation Detail at the United States Pentagon.
CODY => So you were some two bit criminal who got caught and sentenced to clean toilets at the Pentagon? I IDOLIZED YOU MAN!
FOUR LEAF => God-dammit, would you LISTEN! I was a fuckup, sure, but one day as I was cleaning the office of some Top-Brass big- wig, I came across a file headed for the shredder marked top secret. It was Four Leaf Tayback's file. A nobody. No family. Nothing. Killed in Action. They were gonna bury the whole thing. Total black op.
CODY => So you decided to take his identity?
FOUR LEAF => NO! I gave him one! I wrote the story And I gave the American people a hero! Yes, I am not technically Four Leaf, but if I didn't pretend to be him then nobody woulda ever known who he was! See what I'm sayin'?
CODY => And you cashed in!
FOUR LEAF => I was a fuck up my whole life! This guy had a story worth-telling, and nobody woulda ever known! Cody slumps in the corner, looking spent and lost.
FOUR LEAF => I'm sorry, man.. I'm responsible: for this .whole mess.
PORTNOY => I'm clean! I'M CLEAN!!!!! He struggles to his feet, doing a celebratory dance. He immediately gets nauseous again and heaves.
PORTNOY =>  My ' life .be_gins today!
BYONG => Mr. Rick Peck. So far you have refused to give us the respect we asked for. Maybe this will change your mind. Please state your name.
SPEEDMAN => Chris Michael Speedman.
BYONG => Who do you work for, Mr. Speedman?
SPEEDMAN => Well, I guess that really varies from project to project-- Byong SCREAMS at Speedman, who cowers. Even Rick flinches.
TRAM => Wrong answer!! You work for me now!! Do you understand! Like my desk or my gun, you are mine and you exist for me!!
SPEEDMAN => Yes! I work for you!
PECK => Get this yutzle on the phone. Now.
BYONG => Yes.
RICK => I saw your 'little fax, Flaming Fuckwads. I bet you thought I was just. going to lie here and take it. Well, wrong! My name is Rick Peck, not Rick Shaw,..and you are not gonna take me.for a ride, you industrious fuck; I don't care who you people think you are, but I am coming. there, and I am going to jack you up! I am bringing the heavy artillery, my friend, so you'd better be prepared for a blood bath.! I am walking out of there with Chris Speedman whether you, or he, likes it or.not! Rick slams down the phone, enjoying himself.
RICK => Shandra, get tech support to put a trace on this email attachment, let's find out where this "Flaming Dragon" agency is! Call the travel department. See if they got a nonstop to Bien-Ben-Wherever-the fuck-it-is!
SANDUSKY => This is it. You know what you need to do.' Tropic Thunder on three, two, one...
TROPIC THUNDER! => They make their way down the hill.
scamper over... => Finally, it's PORTNOY'S turn. He's clearly too heavy. The fence groans under'his weight. He launches himself -- and... THWANG!!! Slams painfully into the razor wire of the fence. GUARDS hear the noise. They raise their weapons and listen.. They see nothing in the pre-dawn darkness... The actors run to the wall and clumsily pull PORTNOY down, just in time. Everyone's inside the perimeter... they quickly make their way along the fence line to the entrance of the main building, ducking away to avoid a LONE GUARD.
HALLWAY => Sandusky moves silently toward a door. He kicks it'open to reveal...
SPEEDMAN => Shackled to the floor. Delirious, he sits bolt upright.
SPEEDMAN => You mu-mu-make me ha-aa-ppy.
SANDUSKY => Oh sweet Jesus. Hold tight, Buddy! I'll be right back! Sandusky runs off to get the guys.
HALLWAY => Sandusky rounds up Redyk and Lazarus, points to both of his eyes, signalling that he's got "eyes",on Speedman. They take a step in that direction. Redykulous stops them, and makes a made up, absurd signal for "Where is Portnoy?", somehow trying to mime looking for a fat guy. No one knbws what he is doing.
SANDUSKY => Shhh! A muffled, anguished animal noise that could only be PORTNOY emanates from a nearby door. They run towards it. Redykulous kicks it in.
HEROIN HEAVEN => The 'gang flies in, to discover Portnoy holding the bags, crying.
REDYKULOUS => What are you doing, man!
SANDUSKY => Come on, let's go! We found Speedmani
PORTNOY => I don't care! It doesn't matter what I do! I'll always be a screw-up! No one will ever respect me...
REDYKULOUS => That's not true! Listen, back in the day, I used to think I couldn't produce a record simply because...
SANDUSKY => .he's gay. Uh-oh. That's not what Redykulous was about to say. Beat.
REDYKULOUS => Actually I was going to say poor.
SANDUSKY => Sorry...
LAZARUS => Listen.. .Don't be crazy Portnoy --you're not a fuck up. You'make millions of people laugh!
PORTNOY => You said my farts made them laugh! Leave me ALONE!!
REDYKULOUS., => That ain't true Portnoy! Lotta people be fartin' and not be gettin' 20 large a pop for it!
HEROIN ROOM => The guys hear the guards enter the far side of the room. They can't see the guys through the.shelves packed with heroin packets.
SANDUSKY => Damnit! We need to go!
PORTNOY => No, I can't do it.  I need it! I need it!! This'is all I deserve.
REDYKULOUS => Come on, man... And.the guards emerge. around a corner! They jab their rifles.at:the guys and SCREAM AT THEM TO PUT THEIR HANDS
UP! => The guys all slowly raise their hands... Then, in a moment of craziness, PORTNOY CHARGES THE
CODY => What?
FOUR LEAF => Something's happening! Get me the hooks!
HEROIN ROOM => Portnoy watches as the white faced guards fall to their knees, choking and groggy. After a beat, they collapse.
PORTNOY => Let's move! We got about sixteen hours before they wake up! They run out.
SPEEDMAN'S CELL => The guys run in. Redykulous breaks the lock off Speedman's ankle with his rifle butt. Sandusky keeps watch by the door.,
REDYKULOUS, => C'mon! We're busting you out!
SPEEDMAN => Muh-my nnnname is Juh-Jack. Some folks call muh-me Simple Juh-Jack.
REDYKULOUS => What's wrong with him?
SANDUSKY => I think he thinks he's Simple Jack. Like from the movie?
LAZARUS' => Shite. I was afraid of this. The same thing happened to me when I played Neil Armstrong in "Moonshot". They found me in an alley in Burbank re-entering the Earth's atmosphere in an old refrigerator box.
REDYKULOUS => I heard that movie was good.
SANDUSKY => Can you fix him?!
LAZARUS => I'll try. Lazarus takes Speedman's face in his hands, forces him to look at him.
LAZARUS => .You're Chris Michael Speedman!
SPEEDMAN => Ah 1-1-likes pie.
LAZARUS => You're the greatest star in the world! There's a flicker of intelligence in Speedman's eyes. It passes.
CODY => By the way, what's your name anyway?
FOUR LEAF => Marvin Kaminsky.
CODY => you ever been in this jungle?
FOUR LEAF => Nope. First time outta the states actually. He shoots off a round and they run for cover.
LAZARUS => The world needs you! It` needs its stars! You make people forget how awful and 1 I Ii I. 1 ,14M depressing their lives are! People love your work! And... I love your work, too. Speedman is quiet.
SPEEDMAN I => Uhhhh-uh-I'm... Spah-speeedman?
LAZARUS => Simple Jack was magnificent!
SANDUSKY => Is it working?
LAZARUS => JESUS! Give me time, Sandusky! I'm not re- programming a VCR!!  You really committed yourself. And for that you DESERVED AN OSCAR! Speedman registers this.
YOU ARE! => Lazarus's own words make him stop and think.
LAZARUS =>  You know who you are... . you do Chris. Long beat.
LAZARUS => Unlike me. What am I doing? I can't do this. How can I convince a man he is who we know he is, when I can't even convince myself of the same thing. He lets go of Speedman, and begins to break down.
REDYKULOUS => Yo, c'mon, man! Why is everybody gettin'. so insecure alla a sudden?! You're Kirk Lazarus! You're like the greatest actor in the motherfuckin' world!
SANDUSKY => Guys, let's go, we gotta get outta here! I it I. 11h.4%
LAZARUS => Am I Redykulous? ... AM I!...Or.am I just acting like that's who I am? No. The sad fact is... I'm not Sergeant Osiris. . .or Father O'Malley ...or' Neil .Armstrong. I'm not even .Kirk Lazarus.  I have no idea who I am. The guys look at him... it's the first time he has let his guard down.
SANDUSKY => Kirk, this is NOT the time!
LAZARUS => And I guess when you-do themath... .and boil it all down, I've invented myself so many times... .became so many people... .that at the end of the.day...I'm
REDYKULOUSI => Bull-s-hit! Y-ou-l-isten to-me .-.-Y-ou-a-r-e-who you want to be, and you-have to OWN. THAT! Look at me! I'm GAY and, I'm proud! He winks at Sandusky.
REDYKULOUS => That's right! We're.not what we're called, or who we pretend to be. We are what we are in our hearts. And to me, looking into your heart, you're a hero.. Lazarus looks to Redykulous.
LAZARUS => You mean that?
REDYKULOUS => .Yup.
REDYKULOUS => And one of the finest pieces of black ass I ever seen come out of Belfast. Thera,... from off camera.
SPEEDMAN => And I'll second that. They all'turn to see...SPEEDMAN. The million-dollar smile is back!
SPEEDMAN => Now let's get the hell outta here! Speedman leads the men to the door. Sandusky tosses Speedman'a machine gun.
SPEEDMAN => Thanks Kevin.
SANDUSKY => My name...you remembered my name. You gotta show us the way outta here Chris.
SPEEDMAN => Follow me. This time they do...
HALLWAY => The guys run toward the opening to the courtyard, Speedman leading the way...
SPEEDMAN => That's their supply chopper.
SANDUSKY => If we could create a diversion, we could get to that jeep and drive it right over there...
PORTNOY => Anybody here know how to fly a helicopter? Cause that would come in, handy too.
SPEEDMAN => You want a diversion? I'll give you a diversion. Is this baby loaded? He holds up the machine gun...
SANDUSKY => Yeah, but... And with'that, Speedman runs out in to the courtyard,.. the opposite direction from the jeep, doing a CRAZY WAR'
WHOOP... => A BUNCH OF GUARDS turns to,see.him... he does a-SUPER MACHO TUCK AND ROLL, landing perfectly and EMPTYING HIS
SANDUSKY =>  .they're blanks... There is a long moment of silence as the guards just stare at Speedman. He seems a. bit surprised that. they are not dead,. as do the guards themselves. They cock their weapons, about to shoot him when.,.. A HAIL OF-BULLET FIRE-erupts-behind-the-gu-ards... They turn...WE REVEAL CODY AND FOUR LEAF BEHIND THEM, THEIR
SANDUSKY => Let's move! The.guys jump into the jeep, Sandusky at the wheel, and 'gun it..
SANDUSKY => Chris, come.on! Speedman jumps. into the jeep as it passes by. They are speeding toward the helipad.
SPEEDMAN => Four Leaf! Effects guy! Come on!!
SANDUSKY => Get in the Jeep!
FOUR LEAF => You go... I got real bullets! I'll cover you.. It's the only way you'll make it!
CODY => Marvin, you gotta --
FOUR LEAF => Just go!! Sandusky looks at Speedman... they both know he's right. They go... leaving Four Leaf in the dust, still firing... The jeep speeds up to the helipad... the guys jump out. Just as the last guy is out...
our guys! => The guys are freaked and shaken, but start to get in the chopper... Sandusky pushes Cody in...
SANDUSKY => Start the chopper now Cody! Cody nods, getting his bearings... and hitting the ignition...the BLADES SLOWLY HUM TO LIFE, BEGINNING TO TURN... Portnoy grabs Cody's gun and hangs by the runner, shooting towards approaching guards...
I'M TRYING!! => Portnoy is not being heroic, he, is genuinely having trouble getting in.-the chopper. But then Speedman sees something...
SPEEDMAN => It's him...
SPEEDMAN'S POV => FOUR LEAF... much-like.Speedman playing him in the beginning of the. movie... Arms extended, his body riddled with bullets...
FOOCK! => Cody lowers the chopper ... Speedman jumps out...
SPEEDMAN => Cover me! Speedman runs towards Four Leaf, through a hailstorm of bullets...PORTNOY AND THE GUYS PROVIDE AS MUCH COVER AS
FOUR LEAF => Go on...get outta here. I'm worm food, you dig?
FOUR LEAF => I ain't Four Leaf, Chris. We're in this mess because of me.
SPEEDMAN =>  How did you get hands?
FOUR LEAF => I ain't never been worth a nothin'...and it's too late to start bein' a somethin' now. Speedman tries to understand. He is welling up with emotion.. .real emotion.
SPEEDMAN => Don't you die on me! Don't you... And his weeping continues. He then looks up. to see:
HILARY SWANK => And the Oscar goes to...Chris,Michael Speedman as himself in ".PLAYING HOOKY
ANNOUNCER => This is Chris Michael Speedman's first Oscar. He joins four time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus, tonight's Best Supporting Actor winner for the role of Marvin Kaminsky... And we FREEZE on Speedman and Lazarus, grinning eat to ear, arms' around each other, awards in hand...
PECK => Ok, look, you wanna go through this again, let's do it. I see more for you than this. This whole 'big fish in the little scary jungle pond' thing. I see you as a front man, as a leader, not just of this little rebel guerilla warrior group. I see it big picture. Is it music, is it movies? Is it a series on Fox? I don't know. But I do know it is not happening with you staring at me doing my "I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings" routine for you and the peanut gallery for another six months. It's old school already. TRAN and some HENCHMEN watch, unamused. Tran nods, one of the henchmen turns a handle which lowers the cage into the water. After a moment, it comes back up with a soaking Peck.
PECK =>  And it makes me sad to see you chomping on the stogie and you're not even fourteen or whatever. I'm thinking "what hole does that need to fill, that you have to keep dipping me into the water to somehow feel better about yourself?" I can be a partner to you, not just a captive.
PECK => But you have to allow me into your inner workings, into your headspace to facilitate that. And"to do that you gotta let me outta the cage,'both figuratively and literally. Until you can let me go, I you.can't let you go. Do you get that? He gets dunked in the water again.
PECK => Obviously not. Dare I bring up.a sore subject. Can we do a little business on the blackberry privileges? Cause you're killing me here.
