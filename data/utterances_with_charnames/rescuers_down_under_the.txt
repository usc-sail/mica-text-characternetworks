Running time => 74 minutes
(opening => The camera slowly zooms through a variety of insects and rocks. We follow a small yellow bug climb up a blade of grass.  As it spreads its wings to fly, we are whisked along the Australian outback and prairie by Ayers rock and eventually slow down as we approach Cody's house.)
Announcer => ... thundershowers are expected in the Crocodile Falls area and some of the surrounding gullies so take out your...
Mom => Cody!
Cody => Yeah mom?
Mom => What about your breakfast?
Cody => I've got some sandwiches in my pack.
Mom => Well be home for supper.
Cody => No worries mom.
Cody => I know, I'm coming.
Faloo => You don't know her, Cody, her name is Marahute, the great golden eagle.
Cody => Where is she?
Faloo => She's caught, high on a cliff in a poacher's trap.  You're the only one who can reach her.
Cody => I'll get her loose.
Faloo => Right-oh, hop on, no time to lose.
Cody => Marahute!
Cody => Heh heh... hey little fella, what happened to you?
Baitmouse => Oh no! No, no, no, no!!  Get away, get away! It's a trap, it's a trap.  Be careful, NO!
Cody => Don't worry, I'll get you loose.  Woah! (Cody falls into the trap.  He looks up to see a blinking light and the alarm.)
McLeach => Got one!!
Baitmouse => Are you alright?
Cody => Yeah, I think so.
Baitmouse => Okey-dokey.
Cody => Wait!  Hey!  Come back!
Baitmouse => Here you go, grab on.
Cody => That's great, just a little more, a little further... there!  I got it.
Baitmouse => Uh-oh.
Baitmouse => Yipe!
McLeach => Well Joanna, what'd we get today? A dingo, a fat ol' razorback, or a nice big.... boy?!?
her.) => Joanna, you been diggin' holes out here again??  (mumbling to himself) Dumb lizard always tryin' to bury squirrels out here.
Cody => Unh-unh.  It's a trap, and poachin's against the law.
McLeach => Trap?!  Where'd you get an idea like that??  Boy I think you've been down in that hole for too long.  (he holds his gun out so that Cody can grab it) Well c'mon, grab ahold.  We'll get you out of this little ol' lizard hole and you can just run along home.
Cody => This IS a poacher's trap and YOU'RE a poacher.
McLeach => I'm gonna kill her.   I'm gonna kill that dumb, slimey, egg-sucking salamander.
Cody => Cut it out!  Get off of me!
McLeach => Hmmm.... good girl Joanna.
Cody => It was a present.
McLeach => Oh, that's real nice.  Who gave it to ya?
Cody => It's a s... secret.
McLeach => That's no secret boy, you see,  I already got the father.  (makes a cutting sound and draws a feather across his neck like he was slashing a throat).  He, he he.  You just tell me where momma and those little eggs are.
Cody => NO!!
McLeach => Joanna, sick 'em!
McLeach => You're comin' with me boy.
Cody => My mom'll call the rangers!
McLeach => Oh no.... not the rangers, what'll I do?? What'll I do??!  Don't let your mom call the rangers!!  Please don't!!    (McLeach throws Cody's backpack into the river)  My poor baby boy got eaten by the crocodiles, boo-hoo-hoo!  Let's go boy!
Cody => Help!  Help!
Baitmouse => Help, help, help!!  Someone help!  McLeach took the boy.  He took the little boy.  Send for help!!
Mouse => Code red, code red!!  Attention all Rescue Aid Society delegates, all delegates please report immediately to the main assembly hall. This is an emergency meeting.  I repeat, this is a code red emergency meeting!!
Chairmouse => Order!  Order!  Yes, yes I know it's late but I'm... oh really! Sir Charles.  Hello, hello Frank, how are you, nice to see you! And Esmerelda, there you are!  Ha ha.. all right, quiet now please, everyone pay attention.  There has been a kidnapping in Australia.    A young boy needs our help.  This is a mission requiring our very finest, and I know we are all thinking of the same two mice.  (everyone looks to the seats of Hungary and USA, which are empty)    What's this?!?  Gone?  We must find Bernard and Miss Bianca at once!
Cricket => Oh.... pea soup.
Cricket cook => Pea soup!
Bianca => To my dear Bernard, and our wonderful partnership.
Bernard => Ah... yeah.. yeah.. ah.. won... wonderful.
Bianca => You've been very quiet this evening, is there something on your mind?
Bernard => Well, ummm... actually... I, ah... I was wondering.... (he reaches into his pocket.)
Bianca => Yes darling?
Bernard => I... Miss Bianca would you.... would you... (the ring falls through a hole in Bernard's pocket onto the floor) would you excuse me for a minute?
Francois => Pardonnez moi, mademoiselle Bianca, I have important news.
Bianca => Yes Francois?  What is it?
Francois => You and Bernard have been asked to accept a dangerous mission to Australia.
Bianca => Oh the poor boy.  This is dreadful.  Now where is Bernard I must tell him at once!
Francois => Allow me madame, I will tell him immediately.
Bernard => Miss Bianca, will you marry me?  Miss Bianca, will you please marry me?
Francois => Quickly monsieur Bernard!  I must speak with you....
Bernard => Not now Francois, I'm busy!
Francois => No, no, no, no, monsieur you don't......
Bianca => Bernard, did you talk to Francois?
Bernard => Ah yes, but uh.. there's... there's something I want ......
Bianca => I know exactly what you're going to say.  Francois told me all about it.
Bernard => He did?  How, how... how did he ...
Bianca => Oh it doesn't matter, I think it's a marvelous idea.
Bernard => You do?  I mean, you... you really want to?
Bianca => I don't think it's a matter of wanting, it's a matter of duty.
Bernard => D-duty?  I... I never thought of it, well, umm... all righ.... all right.  How does... how does next ah-April sound to you?
Bianca => Heavens no!  We must act immediately, tonight!  (she leaves the restaurant with Bernard close behind)
Bernard => Tonight?  But, but, ah.. wait!  Uh, Bianca, this is so sudden, I mean, don't you at least need a gown or something?
Bianca => No, just a pair of khaki shorts and some hiking boots!
Bernard => Hiking boots?
Chairmouse => Ah, there you are, come along, come along.
Bianca => Delegates, we have an important announcement.  Bernard and I have decided,  to accept the mission to Australia.
Bernard => Australia?
Chairmouse => Oh good show!  Now, you must fly out immediately!  It's a little nippy outside, but we won't let that stop us, will we?  What? 
Bernard => Miss Bianca, I'm not sure it's such a good idea to... to fly this soon after eating!
Bianca => Darling you'll be just fine!
Bernard => But aren't, aren't you supposed to wait 45 minutes?
Bianca => Oh, just knock on the door and see if Orville is there!!
Bernard => Well, nobody's home, let's go.
Bianca => Bernard!!   This is no time to play in the snow.
Bernard => I wasn't playing in the snow.  It... it was an avalanche.
Bianca => Oh look Bernard!    Under new management, see Wilbur.  C'mon darling, let's get a move out!
Bianca => Yoo-hoo!  Mr. Wilbur!  Hello?
Bernard => Look out!!  Excuse me!
Bianca => Bernard DO something!  He can't hear us!
Wilbur => when I go by..... Hey, who killed the music?!?
Bernard => That's better.
Bianca => Excuse us for interrupting, we're from the Rescue Aid Society.  I am Miss Bianca...
Wilbur => Miss Bianca!?!
Bianca => and this is my....
Wilbur => THE Miss Bianca?  I don't believe it.  My brother Orville told me ALL about you, oh boy, I... this is an honor to have.... may I just say enceinte senorita to you?  May I? 
Bernard => Ahem.   We need to charter a flight.
Wilbur => Well, you've come to the right place, buddy boy, welcome to "Albatross Air"  -  a fair fare from here to there. Get it?  A fair fare?  It's a... a play on... nevermind, I've got tons of exotic destinations, far away places, custom designed for  "romantic weekend getaways". As well as the finest in-flight accomodations.  Speaking of which, what can I get ya?  (fumbles, searches through his cooler)  How about a nice mango-Maui cooler?  Very, very nice, very tasty....
Bianca => No thank you...
Wilbur => Or a ah.....  Coconut guava nectar?  It's carbonated.  Very nice.  I got little umbrellas for each one of them and a little coconut thing....
Bianca => No, it's urgent that we leave immediately!
Wilbur => Nothing?  Nothing at all?
Bernard => Wilbur.
Wilbur => How about a cream soda?
Bernard => Now look, we need a flight to Australia.
Wilbur => Australia?  The Land Down Under?  That's a fabulous idea!  So when can I pencil you in?  Ah... after spring thaw?  You know, mid-June would be very nice.
Bianca => Oh know, we must leave TONIGHT.
Wilbur => C'mon you're kiddin' me right?   Have you looked outside?  (he opens the window) It's suicide out there!  Oh-ho, oh no.  OH NO....I'm afraid your jolly little holiday will have to wait. What a bunch of jokers.
Bianca => But you don't understand, a boy needs our help, he's in trouble.
Wilbur => A boy?  You mean, a little kid kinda boy?
Bianca => He was kidnapped.
Wilbur => Kidnapped?   Aw... that... that's awful.  Lockin' up a little kid.  A kid should be free.  Free to run wild through the house on Saturday mornings,  free to have cookies and milk, and get those little white moustaches, you know, with the.....  NOBODY'S gonna take a kid's freedom away while I'm around, nobody, do you hear me?!?
Bianca => Does that mean you'll take us?
Wilbur => Storm or no storm, Albatross Airlines, at your service!!
Bianca => Captain, is this a non-stop flight to Australia??
Wilbur => Well, ah...not exactly no, I could definitely say no.  We're gonna have to make connections with a bigger bird.    Non-stop? What do I look like, Charles Lindburgh??
Cody => Lemme outta here!!  Lemme go!!  You can't do this!!  Help!  Help!  Help!
McLeach => Breaker, breaker, little mate.  I forgot to tell ya around here, you need to be QUIET!!    Or the rangers might hear ya.  Now sit down and relax, enjoy the view. Nothin' but abandoned opal mines as far as the eye can see.  And dead ahead, is home sweet home.   (from a distance) Home, home on the range.  Where the critters are tied up in chains.  I cut through their sides, and I rip off their hides. And the next day I do it again.  Everybody!  Home, home on the range.....
Mom => Cody!  Cody!  Cody!
Announcer => Ladies and gentlemen, Flight 12 is now approaching Sydney airport, make sure you pick up your parcels and packages and enjoy your stay in Australia.
Bernard => Are we there yet?
Bianca => Yes.  You know, perhaps we should wake up Wilbur.
Bernard => Oh, oh... alright, I'll get him up.    Ahhh... Wilbur?    Wilbur?  Wilbur??
Wilbur => Um, yeah, just five more minutes ma.  (Wilbur rolls over, trapping Bernard and Bianca)
Wilbur => That's all I need, five more minutes.
Bianca => Wilbur??  Are you awake??
Bernard => Get, get up we're there!!
Wilbur => O.k. I'm up, I'm up.
Bernard => Watch out you got....
Wilbur => Oh!  I must'a been sleepin' on a bolt.  Ooo.  (plane body opens)  Oh boy.  Throw another shrimp on the barbie girls, cause HERE I COME!!
Bernard => Here we go again!!
Wilbur => CANNONBALL!!!!!
Bianca => Weeee!!
Wilbur => Gang way!  Comin' through, mice on board!!  Clear the way!  Move over madam, there you go!  Comin' through sir, thank you. Next stop, Mugwomp Flats.  Did we lose anyone back there?  .
Bernard => Miss Bianca, from.. from now on, can't... can't we just take the train?
Jake => Well Sparky, you've had this comin' for a long time.  And now, you're gonna get it.  Ha!
Jake => Hmmm... wise fly.
Wilbur => Mugwomp tower, Mugwomp tower, this is Albatross One Three requesting permission to land.  Over?
Jake => Albatross?  (Jake flips over the checkerboard to a chart that has various bird sizes)  Let's see... finch, wren, scrub bird, lockeet, freckled duck, culah, kukaberra, parrot, cockatoo, alba... alba...?!?!  It's a jumbo!!
Wilbur => Not long enough?!?  Look pal, I can land this thing on a dime!
Bernard => Uh... Wilbur, if, if the runway isn't long enough...
Wilbur => Listen you can't let these radar jockeys push you around.  Just leave it to me alright?
Jake => I say again mate, our runway is too short.
Wilbur => And I say again, MATE, I'm comin' in!!
Jake => Crazy Yank.  Quick Sparky, we gotta find a way to extend the runway.
Wilbur => Here we go!
Bernard => We..., we'll never make it!!
Wilbur => Hot!  Oooh!  Ow!  Passengers please remain seated until the aircraft comes to a full and complete stop.  Thank you.
Jake => Quick Sparky, we need to make a drag line!
Wilbur => Don't try and tell ME the runway's too short.  Ha!  (to Jake) Hold this for me will ya pal?  (Wilbur "hands" him the bra which launches Jake backwards.)
Jake => Bloke oughtta have his wings clipped.
Wilbur => You captain thanks you for flying Albatross Airlines.....
Jake => Crazy Yanks.  They think they can do any fool thing, without regard for.....
Bianca => Oh, how kind.
Jake => Allow me to get that bag for ya.
Bernard => I've a.... I've got a lot of... luggage here...
Wilbur => Here let me give you a hand with those bags pal, all part of the friendly service here at Albatross Air (Wilbur picks up two of the bags; a crunch is heard)  Ow!  Oh!  Big time hurt!  Ah back!!  Oh it's out!
Bianca => Wilbur, are you alright?
Jake => Don't worry ma'am, I'll handle this.  Sparky, you watch the tower, we gotta get this bird to the hospital.
Wilbur => Oh.... can't go down, can't go up.  Oh ! Take the bags, take the bags!
Nursemice => Heave!  Ho!  Heave!  Ho!
Wilbur => Hey, whaddya doin'?  Hey, what... what's going on?  Wait!  Hey wait a minute... just stop everything.
Bianca => Wilbur, don't worry.  We'll come back the moment we find the boy.
Wilbur => Wait!  Hey!  Wait a minute!  Don't leave me here, please!  I'm feeling much better now.  I'm even ready to hit the beaches .  I'm even ready to mambo.  (Wiggles in the restraints).
Bianca => Doctor, will he be alright?
Doctor => Now, now, my dear.  Keep a stiff upper lip.  They all come in with a whimper, and leave with a grin.  Off with you now. Leave everything to me.  Shoo, shoo, off you go.
Wilbur => Will it, will it hurt doc?
Doctor => Dear boy, you won't feel a thing.   Launch the back brace!
Wilbur => Hey!  Hey wait!  Wait!  Woah!! I've been skewered.
Doctor => I've already missed tea, Mr. Albatross, now don't force me to take drastic measures.  You MUST relax.
Wilbur => Relax?!?  I have never been more relaxed in my life!!  (begins to get hyper) If I were any more relaxed, I'd be dead!!!
Doctor => Sixty milligrams!
Nursemice => Sixty milligrams.
Wilbur => Hey... wha.... are... are you guys crazy?  You can't do that to me!  I'm an American citizen buddy!!!
Doctor => Better double it!
Wilbur => DOUBLE?!?
Nursemice => Double, coming up! (they load up another needle in the other chamber.)
Wilbur => Nooo!!
Doctor => Prepare the albatross for medication.
Wilbur => Oh, I'm dreamin'... I'm dreamin'!!  Come on Wilbur, wake up boy, wake up!!
Doctor => Three degrees right.
Wilbur => Come on!!
Nursemice => Three degrees right.
Wilbur => Come on, it's a joke, it's a joke!
Doctor => Down two degrees.
Wilbur => Oh no, don't go down two degrees!
Nursemice => Down two degrees.
Doctor => Ready!
Wilbur => No I'm not ready!!  No, please!!
Doctor => Aim!!
Wilbur => please don't do this to me......
Doctor => FIRE!!
Wilbur => Ow, ow, oh. ooo......
Bernard => Now we just.... gotta figure out how to get there.
Jake => So, ah... you and your umm... husband here on a little outback excursion?
Bianca => Oh no, no, we're not married.
Bernard => In fact we're, we're here on a, a top ah.. secret mission. Very... very.. hush, hush.
Jake => Oh!  Gotta rescue that kid McLeach nabbed eh?
Bianca => Why that's right!  How did you know?
Jake => You'll find it's tough to keep secrets in the outback miss. So ah.... which way ya takin'? Suicide trail through Nightmare Canyon, or the shortcut at Satan's ridge?
Bernard => Su... Suicide trail?
Jake => Good choice.   More snakes, less quicksand.  Then once you cross Bloodworm Creek, you're scot free, this is until ummm... Dead Dingo Pass.
Bernard => Wait, wait, wait a minute, I don't.... I don't see any, any of that, that stuff on the map.
Jake => A map's no good in the outback!    What you really need is someone,  someone who KNOWS the territory.
Bianca => Oh Mister Jake, will you guide us?
Jake => At your service!  (he bows and shoves the map behind him into Bernard's gut.)  Here better take my arm miss it's gonna be a treacherous hike.   I remember the time Miss B. it was just me and four hundred of these big giant.....
Bernard => Doesn't even know how to fold a map....
Jake => This is how we get around in the outback Miss B.    The only way to travel, eh Berno?
Bernard => Ah yeah, yeah, it's just a little, a little ah.. bumpy back here.
Jake => Cinch up your seatbelts mates, we're comin' in for a landing.
Bernard => Hold it, not, not yet!! (Bernard gets launched into a patch of briars.)
McLeach => Well boy, let's see if we can do something to refresh that rusty old memory of yours.  Is she on Satan's Ridge? Or Nightmare Canyon??   Whadda you think Joanna?  Yeah, that's it... right smack dab in the middle at Croc Falls!   Am I gettin' warm??
Cody => I told you, I don't remember.
McLeach => Don't you realize a bird that size is worth a fortune??  (in Cody's face) I'll split the money with you fifty-fifty, you can't get a better offer than that boy.
Cody => You won't have any money after the rangers get through with you.
McLeach => .
Bernard => Jake's been gone... ow.... been gone a long time... maybe I should go, oh!  Maybe I should go look for him.
Bianca => Oh don't you worry about Jake, he can handle himself.
Bernard => Yeah, I... I noticed.
Bianca => I am just sure he'll be back in no time.
Bernard => You know... now that we're alone,  there's... there's something that I've, I've been wanting to uh... to.. to ask you.
Bianca => Yes?  What is it?
Bernard => Well, it's uh.... it's like this... Miss Bianca I....  I would be... (he takes her hand) most honored... if..  if...
Jake => LOOK OUT!!! No mice for you Twister not today!!  (Jake proceeds to lasso the mouth of Twister the snake.) There!
Bernard => Miss Bianca!
Jake => I've been looking all over for you.  Now look... we got a long way to go, and you're gonna take us there, and you're not gonna give us any trouble about it.  Right??
Bianca => It's alright Bernard, Jake has everything under control.
Bernard => Yeah, I noticed.
Jake => You know Miss Bianca, truth be told, I used to be quite a dingo wrestler.  Yeah, there was this one time, it was just me and  300 of these ferocious mouse-eating dingo's right... had me surrounded.... decided to ....
McLeach => I'll give you a night down here to think it over.  But tomorrow, no more Mr. Nice Guy.  (McLeach slams the door, Joanna gets her tail caught in it.)  Joanna!  You thick-headed chunk of fish-bait!
Cody => I'll NEVER tell you where she is!  Never!  Never!
Frank => Yeah, never tell!  You'll have to drag it out of us!
Cody => Hey, where did you come from?
Frank => Um... the desert?
Krebbs => Well, well, well, fancy that!  Looks likes McLeach has begun trapping his own kind!  There's no hope for any of us now.
Frank => No hope!  No hope!  No!
Cody => Be there MUST be a way out of here.
Krebbs => Oh, there's a way out all right.
Cody => There is?
Krebbs => Absolutely.   You'll go as a wallet, you'll go as a belt, and our dear Frank....
Frank => No, no, no, I don't want to hear it.
Krebbs => Frank will go as......
Frank => I can't hear you... (Frank covers his ears and begins to sing a nonsense version of the Australian national anthem) la la la la la.....
Krebbs => A purse.
Frank => Aiighh... no!!
Krebbs => Ooo... a lovely ladies' purse.
Frank => Please, please, don't let 'em do it!
Cody => Don't worry, we're gonna get out of here.
Frank => We are?
Cody => Yeah!  If we all put our heads together, I'm sure we'll think of something.
Frank => Yeah, something, something....
Cody => Frank, what's wrong?
Krebbs => Oh, here he goes again.
Red => Take it easy mate, you don't want to hurt yourself again.
Frank => I got it!!  All we gotta do, is get the keys!!
Krebbs => Ohhh!! Is that all??  Well then, we better start packing our bags.
Cody => No wait, he's right.  If we could get these long pieces of wood.... (Cody strains to reach some long pieces of wood through his cage)
Frank => Wood, yeah, wood, wood, wood, yeah good.
Cody => Maybe we could.... (a bird in a "tire cage" helps knock the wood so Cody can reach it.)  that's right just a little more... there, Come on everybody, get some more stuff!!
Red => The kid's right, what are we waiting for?
Cody => That's it, you've got it!  Hurry!  We need something to tie it together!
Frank => Hey, hey, hey, whaddya got, whaddya got, whaddya got??  (Frank gets whopped with a shoe)  Shoelaces!  Oh.
Cody => Almost.... a little further...
Frank => Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Cody => It's o.k. let's try again.
Frank => Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Cody => Easy... easy does it.
Frank => Yeah, no, no, no, yeah, no, yeah, yeah
Krebbs => Somebody shut him up!!
Frank => You've got it! You've got it!  You've got it!
Frank => I've got it!  I'll just take my tail.... and I'll pick the lock.... like this!!
Red => Aww Frank, give it a rest.
Frank => No, no, no!!  You'll thank me when you're free!  Look, look, look, I just insert my tail, like this, and I turn it like this, just a quarter turn to the left, and then push it a little bit further......
(scene change => Jake, Bianca, and Bernard are riding lightning bugs.)
Jake => Ha, ha!!  Show him who's boss Berno!
Wilbur => Ugh... I feel like I got my head in a vise. (zoom out to see Wilbur's head in a vise)  Unh...
Doctor => Are we ready nurse?
Nursemouse => Ready doctor.
Doctor => Alright ladies, snap to it! Ooo... that smarts!  Ah... let me see here.... (hums/sings to himself as he examines the x-ray)... forceps!
Nursemouse => Forceps.
Wilbur => Oh no, what now? (in the background the heart monitor begins to beep faster and faster throughout this part)
Doctor => Spinal stretch-u-lator.
Wilbur => Oh... that's gonna hurt.
Doctor => Artery router.
Wilbur => Mother!
Doctor => This is rusted tight.  I wouldn't DREAM of using such a tool. Bring me the epidermal tissue disrupter! (which is actually a chainsaw)
Wilbur => The epidermal what?!?!   Oh no... no.... NO!
Doctor => Mr. Albatross we haven't operated yet!
Wilbur => You gotta catch me first doc!!
Doctor => Mr. Albatross, please!!
Wilbur => Cowabunga!
Doctor => Mr. Albatross, we must return you to the operating room!
Wilbur => You'll never take me alive!!  (Wilbur attempts to climb out a window
Doctor => Please don't do this!!  Your spine needs tender... .... loving....
Wilbur => Oh.  Ugh.  oh... oh... my... my back!  Hey, hey... I can, I, it works!!  I'm cured!!
Doctor => My back!
Wilbur => Don't worry, I'm coming you little mice... this is the finest fleet on two webbed feet.    Oh boy, I gotta, I gotta go on a diet when I get home.  Here we go!!
Announcer => ... those particular areas, in other news, authorities in Mugwomp Flats have called off the search for the missing boy.  His backpack was found near Crocodile Falls, and local rangers believe he was yet another victim of crocodile attack.  Authorities once again warn residents to use extreme caution when they are....
McLeach => Ha heh!  Think you're pretty smart, don't you eh? Who outsmarted who?  Who?  Who outsmarted who?  I still gotta get that boy, to talking, huh?   I'm hungry. Can't think on an empty stomach... gotta have protein... gotta have.... eggs.  .
Frank => .  Push it in a little bit farther..... .... (Frank opens the cage without realizing it and steps out.)  I give up!  (kicks the door closed) I'll never get this.... we're doomed!  Doomed!
Red => Hey look!  Krebbs, Frank's out!
Cody => Frank, Frank, you're free!
Frank => Free?!   I'm free!  I'm free!  I'm free!  I'm free!.... 
Red => Shhhhh!!! Joanna'll hear!
Krebbs => Double or nothin' he's caught in five minutes.
Cody => Calm down little mate.
Frank => Look at me, I'm free!
Cody => Frank, get the keys.
Frank => I should get the keys.  I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck.... 
Red => Shhh quiet!
Krebbs => Quiet ya fool!
Cody => Take it easy, I'll get you loose.  (twists Frank back through the cage) There ya go.   Now go get the keys.
Frank => The keys.  Yeah, yeah, keys, keys, keys, keys, keys.  (jumps to grab keys and misses) Gee, I can't reach 'em.
Cody => Quick, get something to stand on.
Frank => Yeah, stand on, something to stand on.
Krebbs => This oughtta be rich.
Frank => Yeah, yeah, stand on, stand on....
Everyone => FRANK!
Cody => Use the box!  Climb up on the box!
Frank => box, box..... etc.
Everybody => SHHHHH!  Quiet!
Frank => These are heavy!
Red => The keys Frank, give us the keys!!  Frank, over here!!  Give us the keys!!  (they disappear behind some junk; Frank emerges riding Joanna like a horse with the keys as a bridle) Yeeeeeee-haaaww, ride 'em Frank!!!!
Frank => Ya-hoo, howdy, howdy, howdy!!!!  Howdy, howdy, howdy!!!  (Joanna launches Frank across the room) Yeah, yeah, ....  ....
McLeach => Surprise!!  If I didn't know any better, I'd think you didn't like it here.
Cody => Let me go, let go, let go!!!!
McLeach => HA!!  Whaddya you doin' out of your cage?!?   Uhhh.... that's better. C'mon boy,  say goodbye to your little friends.... it's the last you'll ever see of 'em.
Bianca => There is no time to waste.  We MUST try to get in.
Bernard => Here, here Miss Bianca, start digging.
Jake =>  Has anyone considered trying... "open sesame"?
Jake => Hey it worked!!
McLeach => Get out of here!!  Go on!  Git!!
Bianca => Look Bernard, it's the boy!
Jake => And McLeach.
McLeach => It's all over boy... your bird's dead.  Someone shot her... shot her, right outta the sky, bang!!
Cody => NO!!
McLeach => Whaddya mean 'no'?  You callin' me a liar?  I heard it on the radio this morning, and she could have been mine if it weren't for you, now you better git outta here, before I change my mind.  Go on, git!!
Bernard => Why is he letting him go??
Jake => It's gotta be a trick.
McLeach => Too bad about those eggs, eh Joanna?  They'll never survive without their mother.  Oh well, survival of the fittest, I guess.  (watches Cody run off)
Bianca => Bird?
Bernard => Eggs?
Jake => Shh!  Listen.
McLeach => I didn't make it all the way through third grade for nothing.
Jake => I don't know where he's going, but he can't let him get away. Hurry up you two!!
Bianca => Quickly Bernard, NOW!!
Bernard => Oh no!! Oh no!!  Get between the treads!!
Jake => Bernard!! Bianca!!  Here, catch!!
Bernard => Got it!!  Miss, Miss, Miss Bianca, you, you can do it!!!
Wilbur => Boy, this is some headwind, huh?  Say, , you lovely ladies wouldn't have seen two little mice running around down there, would ya?  Hey where ya going?  I mean it, I'm looking for two little mice!   Is it something I said?
Jake => He's going down the cliff!  C'mon, we gotta warn him!
Bianca => Cody!
Cody => Huh?  Who are you?
Bianca => Oh, there is no time to explain, you're in GREAT danger.
Cody => Marahute?!  It can't be!
Bianca => Oh Cody, Cody wait!!

McLeach => I got her!!!  I got her!!!  Did you see that?    Perfect shot!! Per-fect shot!  She's mine!!    All mine!!!!

Jake => Hold tight you two, we're going for a ride!
Bernard => Bianca!!
Bianca => Bernard!
McLeach => ... Meddlin' brat.  Gonna get rid of him for good.
Cody => Help I'm slipping!
Bianca => Cody, don't move!!
McLeach =>  There she is Joanna.... just look at her.... look at the size of her... the RAREST bird in the world.  That bird's gonna make me rich... I got what I want.  Now, what does Joanna want?  Does she wanna make sure that bird... STAYS rare?   How about some great, big, triple A, jumbo, eagle eggs!!!  Eh?!  You want 'em?!  Eh?!  You want 'em?  Go get 'em girl!!
Cody => NO!!  Please!!
McLeach => Why, whatever is the matter Joanna??  (She points down; McLeach kicks her over the edge).  Git!!
Bernard => O.k. you guys, she fell for it.  Looks like the coast is clear.
Wilbur =>  Where are you, you little chickees you?
Bernard => Wilbur!
Wilbur => Don't EVER do that to me again! Oh... boy... I lost a lot of feathers on that one.
Bernard => Wilbur am I glad to see you!  Give me a hand with these eggs will ya?
Wilbur => Yeah, sure.  Wait a minute.... what the heck are you doing up here anyway??
Bernard => The kidnapper took the boy and Jake.... Miss Bianca.
Wilbur => Miss Bianca??  Miss Bianca's in trouble?!?  Woah!  Geez!  That's terrible!  We gotta do something!   Bernard, I'm disappointed in you.  Hidin' under a nest while Miss Bianca needs our help.  I gotta talk to you mister...
Bernard => Wilbur....
Wilbur => You should start searchin' the desert for her, and I'll scan the coastline!
Bernard => Wilbur...
Wilbur => That's what I'll do....  I'll ask the chicks on the beach.
Bernard => Wilbur!
Wilbur => Huh?  What?!
Bernard => Now listen!   There's some chicks right here that need your help.
Wilbur => Really?    Oh no.... wait a minute... hold it.... I know what you're thinkin' and you're wrong.  Don't even.... no...  don't look at me like that!  You're gettin' no from me!  You understand? No!  I will not.. EVER sit on those eggs!
Aww... nuts! => Gotta learn to be more assertive.  No is no is NO.   Hey, quit movin' in there!
McLeach => Well Joanna, it looks like lady luck has finally decided to smile on us.  Everything's going our way.  .
Cody => You can't do this!!  You're gonna get in big trouble!! I'll tell the rangers where you are!!
McLeach => I almost forgot...we got a loose end to tie up, haven't we girl?
Bianca => Now, now Cody, we mustn't loose hope.  Bernard is still out there...
Jake => That's right!  Is anyone can get us out of this scrape it's old Berno!   Nice bluff, Miss B.
Bianca => I wasn't bluffing.  You don't know Bernard like I do.  He'll never give up.
Bernard => Oh my gosh!
McLeach => Are ya ready boy? It's time you learned how to fish for crocs!  They like it when you use live bait... and you're as live as they come. (laughs and sings as he adjusts a light onto Cody so that the crocodiles can see him)  Oh... you get a line, and I'll get a pole, matey.... you get a line, I'll get a pole, friend.... oh, you get a line, I'll get a pole, we'll go fishin' at the crocodile hole, buddy, pal o' mine....   That's right babies, suppertime!
Jake => It don't look good Miss B.  I can't see any way out of this one.
Bianca => Oh Bernard, please hurry!
McLeach => Now, this is MY idea of FUN.  (begins to play with the hoist controls; dunks Cody in the water and pulls him out.)  Nothing personal boy, but I wouldn't want to disappoint the rangers.  They was looking so hard for ya, and now... they're gonna find ya!  (drops Cody once more, but before Cody hits the water, the power goes out.)
Bianca => Look, it's Bernard!
Jake => I don't believe it!  Way to go mate!
Bernard => Miss Bianca, Jake, catch!!
McLeach => Well, there's more than one way to skin a cat. (getting out his gun)
McLeach => Blasted!!
Bernard => Oh my gosh!  I hope I know what I'm doing!
McLeach => Hey, get off me!!  Joanna!  What are ya.....
Bianca => Bernard the boy!!
Cody => Help!!  Help!!
McLeach => Get back, get back, go on, get away from me, get away from me....  HA!  I whooped ya!  I whooped ya all!  You'll think twice before messin' with Percival C. McLeach!!   Woah!  (realizes that he is headed for the waterfall and tries to swim back; Joanna waves goodbye) NOO!!!!
Bernard => Don't give up Cody!!
Jake => Hop on Miss B.!!
Cody => Help!  Help!
Cody =>   It's o.k.  Come on....  Thanks little mate.
Bianca => Oh Bernard you are magnificent, you are absolutely the hero of the day.
Bernard => Miss Bianca, before anything else happens... (sighs; gets out the ring and gets on one knee).... will you marry me?
Bianca => 
Jake => Well done mate.
Cody => Come on Marahute, let's all go home.
Wilbur => Help!!!  Anybody!!  Bernard!!  Bianca!!  Where are you?!?  (to himself)  O.k., that's it, I'm outta here, this is ridiculous. You can't leave me here alone .  I'm gone!  I am GONE!
