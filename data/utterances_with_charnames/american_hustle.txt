, => stylish crafty smart. They stare at each other intensely -- they have a deep and emotional relationship. A DOOR BANGS OPEN, and in walks RICHIE DIMASO, Bronx-born. He stands there.
RICHIE DIMASO => What are you doing, going behind my back? Telling people I'm screwing up this operation? I got you a suite at the fuckin' Plaza Hotel!
IRVING ROSENFELD => The shittiest suite at the Plaza Hotel.
IRV ROSENFELD => The shittiest fuckin' suite.
RICHIE DIMASO => Based on what--?
EDITH GREENSLY => No
IRVING ROSENFELD => Are you dressing him like you're dressing me now?
EDITH GREENSLY =>  No, what are you thinking? This isn't all about you, you know that.
RICHIE DIMASO => What, did you try to dress me so I would look like him?
EDITH GREENSLY => No, you're not dressed like him, all right?
RICHIE DIMASO => But I do, I look like him.
EDITH GREENSLY => No, he's in like, velvet. Come on.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You asked me to show you how this was done, you wanna fuck it up be my guest.
EDITH GREENSLY => What is your problem?
RICHIE DIMASO => Hey, look, I never laid a hand on her, all right? Is that what this is about?
EDITH GREENSLY =>  Well technically, that's not true.
RICHIE DIMASO => Look, we never had sex ok? I just --
RICHIE DIMASO => What'd I do? I put my hand like this --
IRVING ROSENFELD => Don't you fucking touch me. That bothers me --
RICHIE DIMASO => Oh it does?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Oh yeah.
RICHIE DIMASO => That bothers you?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Yes.
RICHIE DIMASO => You know, a lot of shit bothers me too, but I was trying to help you. If I wanted to bother you, if I really wanted to fucking bother you, this is what I'd do.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You shouldn't have done that.
RICHIE DIMASO => How's that? You bothered now? (no answer) Alright, don't make a thing of it.
EDITH GREENSLY => You shouldn't touch him. He doesn't like that.
RICHIE DIMASO => Oh my god, fix his hair. Don't make a thing of it.
EDITH GREENSLY => It takes some time, ok.
RICHIE DIMASO => Big fucking deal. We got to get in the other room, come on. The mayor's in there.
EDITH GREENSLY => Yes I know that.
RICHIE DIMASO => Should we go to the beauty parlor? Is that what we should do?
IRVING ROSENFELD => How's it look.
EDITH GREENSLY => You look fine.
RICHIE DIMASO => Let's go.
CARMINE POLITO => I thought he was going to be here. I do business face to face, person to person. That's just who I am.
CARL ELWAY => Whoa, excuse me, excuse me. I'll handle that for the Mayor.
RICHIE DIMASO => No, it's for the Mayor. It would be a sign of disrespect to the sheik if the mayor didn't take it himself. It's for you Mayor.
CARMINE POLITO => What are you doing? What-- (to Carl) Carl, what the fuck? What is this?
CARL ELWAY => No, I'll handle it. I'm gonna take care of-- Everything's good. I got everything under control. (TO RICHIE) That's for me. I handle all that for mayor.
CARMINE POLITO => What is this?
EDITH GREENSLY =>  Just stop it, ok
RICHIE DIMASO =>  He's gotta take it himself, okay?
CARMINE POLITO => I don't know what the fuck that is but it's weird you understand?
CARL ELWAY => Misunderstanding. Misunderstanding.
CARMINE POLITO => I came here to meet a sheik, that's all I know. I'm very interested in that but he's not here apparently. Carl?!
CARMINE POLITO => I'm very interested in meeting the Sheik. You let me know when THAT could happen! Thank you, have a good day.
CARL ELWAY =>  Irving! You better come get him.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Go out there and get him right now.
CARL ELWAY => Help me get him back!
RICHIE DIMASO => Go get him. He needs to take the fuckin' briefcase, Irving.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I didn't wanna do it in the first place. This is your show, YOU go get him.
RICHIE DIMASO => No, you have no choice. You have to go get him. Now, go get him, so he takes the briefcase by himself! That's the whole plan, Irving!
IRVING ROSENFELD => What were you doing pushing the fucking briefcase, dummy? Huh?
RICHIE DIMASO => The whole fuckin' thing was falling apart. You know how much I paid for this goddamn hotel that you fucking asked for?!
IRVING ROSENFELD => Now I gotta go mop up your mess. I'm gonna go fucking mop up your mess!
RICHIE DIMASO => You understand what I'm saying, right? It wasn't working.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Did you ever have to find a way to survive and you knew your choices were bad?
IRVING ROSENFELD => I learned how to survive when I was a kid.
IRVING ROSENFELD => My father had a glass business.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I would rather be on the taking side than the getting taken side any day of the week, especially after I saw how my father got taken. I mean, seeing that scarred me for life.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I took it upon myself to drum up business. I became a different kind of guy than my father. I became a con artist -- from the feet up, for real.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I was gonna survive no matter what. I still had the glass business and a few dry cleaning stores on the side.
IRVING ROSENFELD => And I did some art dealing on the side. Stolen or forged art.
IRVING ROSENFELD => So, one January I go to my friends pool party in Long Island.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Is that Duke Ellington on your bracelet?
SYDNEY PROSSER => As a matter of fact, it is. He died this year, you know.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I know. I doubt anyone else here knows or cares about it.
SYDNEY PROSSER => Well I care. He saved my life many times.
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  Mine too. Which one?
SYDNEY PROSSER => Jeep's Blues.
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  Jeep's Blues. Oh yeah.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You wanna hear it?
SYDNEY PROSSER => Right now?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Yeah.
SYDNEY PROSSER => Sure.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Who starts a song like that?!
SYDNEY PROSSER => It's magic.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Magic.
SYDNEY PROSSER => He wasn't necessarily in good shape, and he had this comb-over that was rather -- elaborate. He had this air about him. And he had this confidence that drew me to him. He was who he was and he didn't care.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Like me, she was a very particular person. Like me, she came from a place where her options were limited -- and she had been someone she didn't want to be in her past.
SYDNEY PROSSER => It actually can feel kind of sexy sometimes. There's a boldness in it. But where would that boldness take me? I didn't know. But I was gonna find out.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Like me, she learned to survive and reinvent herself. She knew she had to reinvent her life and her identity. And like me, she envisioned a better elegant future for herself. Like me, she knew you had to have a vision.
IRVING ROSENFELD => She came to New York. She envisioned it. 
IRVING ROSENFELD => And just like that, she applied for a job at Cosmopolitan Magazine.
SYDNEY PROSSER => Alright.
SYDNEY PROSSER => I like it.
SYDNEY PROSSER => Yes.
IRVING ROSENFELD => She was unlike anybody I ever knew. She was smart. She saw through people in situations. And she knew how to live with passion and style. She understood Duke Ellington.
SYDNEY PROSSER => I was broke, fearless, with nothing to lose --
SYDNEY   PROSSER => -- and my dream,   more than anything, was to   become anyone else other than who I   was.
IRVING ROSENFELD => -- I got two in the Bronx and three in Manhattan.  Hey, Byron.
SYDNEY PROSSER => He had a chain of dry cleaning stores. He asked me to come in and upgrade my wardrobe-- he said a lot of nice things got left behind by people and forgotten over the years-
IRVING ROSENFELD => I mean you wouldn't believe the shit that people leave behind here. Unbelievable.
SYDNEY PROSSER => People leave stuff here?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Oh yeah. They go out for the night, they drink, come here in the morning, put their clothes in and then they forget. They got no idea where they left it.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Look at that. Sequined thing. I don't know. Is that nice or not?
SYDNEY PROSSER => It's beautiful.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I mean, some of it's been here for years. They're not picking it up. Nobody's picking it up.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You like that?
SYDNEY PROSSER => I love it.
IRVING ROSENFELD => It's yours. You want it? It's yours.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You look fantastic!
SYDNEY PROSSER => Oh my god. I can only dream about these dresses. They're beautiful.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I felt like we had a secret. Just the two of us. You know like that thing where you want to just be with the one person the whole time.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You feel like the two of you understand something that nobody else gets. I could just tell her everything about myself. And I never had anybody like that in my life before. I felt like finally, I can truly be myself without being ashamed, without being embarrassed.
SYDNEY PROSSER => What is this place? Do you sell art here?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Yeah, sometimes. This is my office.
SYDNEY PROSSER => I know it's your office, but, you have these other places. What's this for? Why did you bring me here?
IRVING ROSENFELD => This getting to be my main business, my growing business. I help get loans for guys that can't get loans. I'm their last resort.
SYDNEY PROSSER => You're their last resort? Because interest rates are north of 12% and heading to 18%.
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's right, smarty pants.
SYDNEY PROSSER => Fucking Jimmy Carter. Fucking Nixon really. And the war and the deficit and all of that shit.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I love you, you're so smart. You are.
SYDNEY PROSSER => Thanks kid but how do you get them the money?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Well --
SYDNEY PROSSER => You don't do you? You don't.
IRVING ROSENFELD => These guys are lousy risks, you know? I can't get them a loan but I get my fee. Five thousand.
SYDNEY PROSSER => Five thousand? You take five thousand and you don't give them anything?
IRVING ROSENFELD => These are bad guys, you know? They got bad divorces, gambling habits, embezzling, all that shit, you know what I mean?
SYDNEY PROSSER => Everybody at the bottom crosses paths eventually in a pool of desperation and you're waiting for them.
IRVING ROSENFELD => How about `we'?
SYDNEY PROSSER => We?
IRVING ROSENFELD => How bout it?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Sydney. Sydney I'm sorry that was too much. I went too far. I didn't want to upset you.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Sydney please, I'm sorry! I know it ain't for everybody.
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  Ah GOD I love getting to know you!
IRVING ROSENFELD => What I do that for? I fucked it up. I should never tell a woman the truth. She's so smart. She's different.
SYDNEY PROSSER => You said it was nice knowing me. You said it was nice to meet me.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Yeah.
SYDNEY PROSSER =>  Would you like to meet Lady Edith Greensly?
SYDNEY PROSSER =>  I have royal banking connections in London. I'd love to help you with your loan but of course I have to be very selective.
IRVING ROSENFELD => That was fucking fantastic.
SYDNEY PROSSER => Thank you. Did you like it?
IRVING ROSENFELD => I liked it. I didn't think you were coming back. Thank god you came back.
SYDNEY PROSSER => I wasn't going anywhere.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I fucking love you.
SYDNEY PROSSER => You have me.
SYDNEY PROSSER => And so Irving and I began our partnership -- in love and commerce.
BUSINESSMAN => Rebecca, hold on. You're Edith right?
SYDNEY PROSSER => He told me to tell my friends I had London banking connections
BUSINESSMAN => I'm Jim. I'm her employer. Listen - - she told me you can get me a line of credit. I know you have banking connections in London, England.
SYDNEY PROSSER => And after that...say "no" a lot until the guy is hooked.
BUSINESSMAN => Becky tell her! I've never missed a check!
EDITH GREENSLY =>  NO!
SYDNEY PROSSER => It was almost scary how easy it could be to take money from desperate people.
EDITH GREENSLY => Lady Edith Greensly, it's so good to see you again.
IRVING ROSENFELD => These are the roles that we were meant to play.
SYDNEY PROSSER => We're very selective.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You got a strong application. We'll talk about it.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I don't take a deal that I can't close.
SYDNEY PROSSER => You're not being aggressive enough in putting up your assets --
DESPERATE MAN => Five thousand gets me fifty right?
ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN => Five will get me thirty five. Is that right?
IRVING ROSENFELD => I was doing so much more business with her. I mean it doubled, then it tripled.
IRVING ROSENFELD => And I never met anyone, man or woman, in business who was so careful and precise about everything. Every stylistic detail.
IRVING ROSENFELD => We kept selling art together, too.
EDITH GREENSLY => It's really a fabulous example of a genre painting, which is really rare for the time. It's a boy and his dog. Non-religious painting. 55. Golden age. Dutch painting.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Paul Klee. Bauhaus Movement. 1920s.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Let's just say it's missing from Spain and leave it at that.
EDITH GREENSLY => Don't show any Spanish friends.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I mean it just took off. We got an elegant Manhattan office. We called it London Associates for her accent.
IRVING ROSENFELD => When I was around her I felt joy. Fucking joy! And love. That's what I felt.
IRVING ROSENFELD => As, as far as I could see, people were always conning each other to get what they wanted. We even con ourselves.
IRVING ROSENFELD => We talk ourselves into things. We sell ourselves things we maybe don't even need or want by dressing them up. We leave out the risk. We leave out the ugly truth.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Pay attention to that because we're all conning ourselves in one way or another just to get through life.
SYDNEY PROSSER => He was married, and he had a son.
SYDNEY PROSSER => He had adopted her son.
DANNY => DADDY!
SYDNEY PROSSER => He was a really good dad and I respected him for that. It was a tough situation for everyone.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Danny. This is a fantastic picture. What did you do today?
DANNY => That kid Donovan is being mean to me.
IRVING ROSENFELD => The big kid? I thought Mommy picked you up so he couldn't bother you.
DANNY => She was late, and then after we put out the fire, mommy said stay in my room with my baseball cards.
IRVING ROSENFELD => What fire?
DANNY => Did you know they make a lamp that has the sun in it? [Irv looks at him] Mommy got the lamp. She made her special drink and the lamp made a fire.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I put out the fire. The fire is out.
IRVING ROSENFELD => For the first time in my life I do the right thing.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Oh shut up --
IRVING ROSENFELD => I save a young single mother, and her kid. I marry her. I adopt him -
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => You fell in love! Don't forget we fell madly in love!
IRVING ROSENFELD => Yes, I fell in love. My God, I fell in love. Yes. But you know what? I thought you were mysterious like my mother until it turned out that mysterious just meant depressed, hard to reach. I mean, I'm dying here! And you need somebody who's gonna be quiet like you. You're young, you're beautiful. You gotta find somebody else. You gotta go out and get some friends all right? Don't sit inside --
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I don't like going out. You know that I get anxiety when I have to meet people. You know how hard that is.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Yeah but you can't just stay in the house with the fucking sun lamp. Alright? And I can't-- I mean, look, I can't trust you with it anyway. That fire and everything. I can't trust to leave you with Danny.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I put the fire out Irving! There is no fire! Maybe if you were here more, then there wouldn't have been a fire in the first place.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Oh, what, there wouldn't have been a fire if I was here?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Just stop with the whole fire thing. God it was a mistake. I'm sure a million people do that all the time. Those sun lamps are dangerous. Shouldn't even have them in the house, really. I bet that happens all the time. This was nothing.
IRVING ROSENFELD => We're not happy. Alright?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => You know that I could take Danny. You know that most of your work is illegal. And you know that if you tried to divorce me, you know that-- I'm not saying that I would, but I'm saying that I could. And I'm saying that that is why I don't like divorce, Irving. Women do that in divorces. Women get the children, and then the fathers never see them. My mother never got divorced. My grandmother never got divorced. There are NO divorces in my family. I am not getting a divorce.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Come on. What are we doing here?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => We fight and we fuck and that's what we do. That's our thing.
IRVING ROSENFELD => She was the Piccaso of passive aggressive karate. She was better than any con artist I'd ever met including myself. And she had me like nobody had me.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Irving, come to mama. Come on.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You might say she was my karma for how I took advantage of people.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Irving, come here. Come on. Get into bed.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Alright.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => 63             Baby, there's such good stuff here.                    63
IRVING ROSENFELD => I did not want to leave the kid behind. He was my son. She had me. I was her mark.
IRVING ROSENFELD => -- and every deal I take, I close. However, my fee is non refundable, just like my time.
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's correct.
EDITH GREENSLY => No, you didn't mention that. Two lunches and you never mentioned that.
EDITH GREENSLY => The hat.
EDITH GREENSLY => You couldn't see his eyes. He had no eyes. It was like, did he make it?
EDITH GREENSLY => You were going to get me one?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Two lunches?
EDITH GREENSLY => Yes. It's two lunches. What's the big deal?
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's unusual.
EDITH GREENSLY => I was trying to get him to be more aggressive. On his loan that is.
EDITH GREENSLY => Oh, good. You're welcome.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Yeah, right. You liked it? Should I take you there?
EDITH GREENSLY => Yes.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Should I take you there twice?
EDITH GREENSLY => Stop.
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  What's going on, you like this guy?
EDITH GREENSLY => Yes I like this guy.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Is that messing up your judgement? Don't be stupid.
SYDNEY PROSSER => No, he's not messing with my judgment.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Hey, play your part.
EDITH GREENSLY => Fine. You play your part.
IRVING ROSENFELD => If you could excuse me for one second?
IRVING ROSENFELD => You got the wrong office, you're gonna be embarrassed.
IRVING ROSENFELD => HEY, HEY, HEY! GO EASY ON HER.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Fraud?! Fraud? What is that? Identity fraud?
EDITH GREENSLY =>  Hey! Not so tight!
IRVING ROSENFELD => Oh really? That's interesting. I don't even know your real name.
RICHIE DIMASO => Richie Dimaso, FBI. Nice to meet you.
RICHIE DIMASO => You gotta get away from this guy.
IRVING ROSENFELD => He wouldn't let me see her for three days. He even managed to delay a lawyer.
IRVING ROSENFELD => 65             She couldn't handle it.                               65
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Jesus I put this lamp here for you 'cause I thought it'd be better for you. There's a wire here. They're scared because people hang themselves but I know you're too smart for that. Where's the table and chair? There's no bed here? It's like a fucking asylum. Joe, is everybody off today? Jesus Christ it's scary. Maybe I wanted to scare you. I don't know. Maybe it was my idea. Maybe i'm a little off the beaten path you know? I don't know. You look dehydrated. Here, want to try some tea? Oh yeah, your lips are all chapped.  It's herbal. My favorite.
RICHIE DIMASO => I know you think -- look at me. Hey. Edith. 
RICHIE DIMASO => I know you think Irv loves you. I know you think you know him -- that he sees the world as a cold, dark place, and he cares about nobody but very few people on his short list: his son, his father, Rosalyn, and you. And you think you're at the top of that list. But what if you're not. What if you're not even on the list at all? He'd be in here right now if he took the check.
RICHIE DIMASO => He'd be in here right now if he took the check. But no, you did. God, it's, it's so clear to me. It's so crazy -- it's clear to me, but it's not clear to you. He uses you, Edith, to protect himself. To protect his son and his wife in Long Island. No? Yes. He put a ring on her finger, he adopted her son. They have huge house, they have two cars. What does she do all day? I'll tell you what she does -- she plays with her nails, she watches T.V., and she spends your money, the money that you make.
RICHIE DIMASO => I don't like that you're in jail while he's going free. I don't like any of that. I want to help you. All the razzle-dazzle that he does, it's not good. It's not real. It's fake. It's not real. Who you are is who you are, between you and God. You and your soul. That's what matters. That's what counts. That's what I'm about. And that's what I see in you. Tell me you didn't feel it the first time we saw each other. Am I crazy? I don't think so. I'm not supposed to be talking like this, but I don't care, I break the rules.
RICHIE DIMASO => Okay, Edith? Edith. I want to help you. I like you.  I like you.  I like you.
RICHIE DIMASO => Been in there three days. Hasn't been so good for her.
RICHIE DIMASO => How does that make you feel her in there? That check was for you, right? But you knew somethin' was off. That's 'cause you're good. You're, like, the best at what you do in the whole country, aren't you?
RICHIE DIMASO => But you know what? If the country were run by people like you, Irving Rosenfeld we'd be living in Eastern Europe or Guatemala. You ever been in Guatemala? You ever been in jail in Guatemala? You ever try to get a telephone or a permit or anything in Guatemala? That's what this country would be like if we let people, let the liars like you, run this country.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Who made you god and judge?
RICHIE DIMASO => My grandmother lived to be ninety- three years old. Never lied in her life.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Congratulations.
RICHIE DIMASO => Thank you. I'm proud of that, too. Does that make her not a good person? Is that not something to strive for?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Why you breaking my balls? Get to the point.
RICHIE DIMASO => I see something in you, Irving. I get very excited. I think that we have a lot of potential here. Now, look. I came up with the idea. It's all from me. I want to change things. I want to go after white collar crime. Irving, you're very skilled. And I want you to teach me and we can do this. I want four people that do what you do. Fraudulent investments. Fake certificates of deposit. Stolen art, fake art. You get me four people and you're off the hook.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Four busts and you'll leave us alone? We don't have to testify?
RICHIE DIMASO => You're good, you're done. Anything you want. But if you run, then your life is over. You'll be hunted, and it's gonna be very difficult for Rosalyn and your kid to live in this country.
SYDNEY PROSSER => We need to leave. We need to run and we need to do it now. We can go to Estonia or Romania, I don't care, we'll take the cash from the bed and get out of here, alright? We talked about it a hundred times.
IRVING ROSENFELD => What about Danny?
SYDNEY PROSSER => What about Danny?
IRVING ROSENFELD => I adopted him! I gave him my name! I'm not leaving him with Rosalyn, she's unstable!
SYDNEY PROSSER => That's a manipulation! Rosalyn's will never let you go. She'll use Danny against you because she's too messed up to let you leave.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I can't leave him. I love him. Alright? He's my son.
SYDNEY PROSSER => Richie said you would say that.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Richie? What, the cop? Your on a first name basis with him?
SYDNEY PROSSER => Yes I am. I'm not even on your list am I?
IRVING ROSENFELD => What list?
SYDNEY PROSSER => Your list. Your short list. Your long list. I'm not even on anyone of your fucking lists. I thought you loved me. I thought we had something.
IRVING ROSENFELD => We do have something. I love you, it's perfect! What are you saying? We're gonna go to Romania? We're gonna take Danny?
SYDNEY PROSSER => Yes. Yes, that's what I'm saying. You, me, Danny.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Well you never said that before.
SYDNEY PROSSER => I'm saying it now. We're us, and we can make it an adventure like we did. We can make it an adventure like we make everything, alright? But we have to go now. We have to leave right now.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I can't leave Danny. I'll lose custody.
SYDNEY PROSSER => You have to take me away! We have to leave!
IRVING ROSENFELD => What are you doing?! Please!
SYDNEY PROSSER => I can't believe this is happening.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Don't say I don't love you because that's bullshit!
SYDNEY PROSSER =>  This is bullshit. You are bullshit. We are bullshit.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Please don't do this.
SYDNEY PROSSER => I just never thought you were conning me.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I could never con you. I love you. Please don't say this.
SYDNEY PROSSER => No, I'm done.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Don't say that.
SYDNEY PROSSER =>  I'm gonna do these four busts, these four cons, to get us out of this. Not just me, but us. And I'm gonna get really close with Richie, the cop, in case we need to use him, if we need another move.
IRVING ROSENFELD => We don't need another move. We need four busts, and we're done.
SYDNEY PROSSER => We are going to need another move, trust me. And you're going to be thanking me. (shifts to British accent) The key to people is what they believe and what they want to believe and I want to believe that we were real, and I want to believe that a man could want me. And I'm gonna take all of that heartbreak, and all of that sorrow, and I am going to use it. And I'm going to make Richie think that I want him, and that I like him, and I'm going to be very convincing -- And I'm pissed at you.
SYDNEY PROSSER => Because I'm pissed at you!
SYDNEY PROSSER => Maybe I do like him -- Maybe I like him a lot. From the feet up right -- baby?
SYDNEY PROSSER => Quite your belly aching and come up with something to get us out of this. And you're right -- I'm in no state to deal with this so what's it gonna be, Mister Mastermind?
RICHIE DIMASO => 69             An Arab sheik? Why do we need an                      69 Arab Sheik?
IRVING ROSENFELD => How do you think this works, stupid?
SYDNEY PROSSER => If you could not call him `stupid' which he's isn't, he's smarter than you. Last I checked he's in control here and we work for him now so be nice.
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  OK, to set this up and bust a con artist we have to make the honey pot to attract the bees. In order to attract the bees, we need to offer them a wealthy individual who can be taken advantage of, someone special, someone new, someone amazing. Then those guys will want to sell fake bank CDS to THAT guy, take the sheik's money, see?
SYDNEY PROSSER => Only they can't get into his money unless you they know someone, and that someone is us.
RICHIE DIMASO => Oh that's good.
RICHIE DIMASO => So if you want to get somebody like your con artist friend -- Carl Elway -- you get him to want to buy-
IRVING ROSENFELD => Keep your voice down.
RICHIE DIMASO => -- or sell fake art or stolen art or fake certificates of deposit, he needs -- who does he need? -- he needs a rich sheik guy, and there you go -- we can pinch him!
IRVING ROSENFELD => Right, but I don't tell Elway shit. I wait for him to call me. The art world is a small world -- and one of Elway's acquaintances is clocking us right now.
RICHIE DIMASO => Where?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Don't look.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You have a good look?
RICHIE DIMASO => How do you know the Sheik?
IRVING ROSENFELD => This is my friend Al from Queens.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I want to show you something. This Rembrandt here? People come from all over the world to see this.
RICHIE DIMASO => Yeah, he's good.
IRVING ROSENFELD => It's a fake.
RICHIE DIMASO => Wait, what're you talking about? That's impossible.
IRVING ROSENFELD => People believe what they want to believe. Cause the guy who made this was so good that it's real to everybody. Now whose the master -- the painter or the forger?
RICHIE DIMASO => That's a fake?
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's the way the world works. Not black and white as you say. Extremely grey.
ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE => Irving can I --
IRVING ROSENFELD => How many times I gotta tell you. You can't meet the sheik, alright?
EDITH GREENSLY => Arthur? Hi. Edith. We've met before.
EDITH GREENSLY => I wanted to introduce you to Robert Spencer. We're advising the Sheik together.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Yeah, I'm Robert Spencer, advisor to the sheik.
CARL ELWAY => What's this I hear about a god damn Sheik?! Why you leaving me out of this? I gotta hear about it from my friends?
IRVING ROSENFELD => It ain't for you Carl.
CARL ELWAY => What do you mean it ain't for me? We gotta do certificates of deposit. I can print as many as you need.
IRVING ROSENFELD => This is not a one man operation.
CARL ELWAY => Look, I can get other guys. What are you talking about Irving?
IRVING ROSENFELD => You're telling me that you can get four guys to sell fake certificates of deposit to my investor within a week?
CARL ELWAY => Yes I can make that happen. Carl Elway can do what he says he's going to do.
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's interesting but you know I've got other guys lined up. I've got a meeting with my associates.
CARL ELWAY => No wait. Don't go anywhere.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I've got to go.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Crazy thing about people -- the more you say no, the more they want in on somethin. It is so stupid.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I'll tell them, don't worry. Hey you know what Carl just told me? He said he could do this whole thing with four guys within a week.
CARL ELWAY => Or we could do somethin' much bigger!
RICHIE DIMASO => Something bigger? My guy deals with hundreds of millions of dollars. How much bigger?
CARL ELWAY => Hundreds of million -- I knew you were holdin' out on me Irving! Hundreds of millions of dollars? Like much bigger. Like I'm talking about we say never the fuck mind the CD's and we could have some complete access to something huge.
RICHIE DIMASO => Huge? Like what? (introducing himself) Robert Spencer, advisor to the Sheik.
CARL ELWAY => Carl Elway.
CARL ELWAY => I want you to think of the most undervalued asset in the state of New Jersey today. The rebuilding of Atlantic City.
CARL ELWAY => Look, maybe they, maybe they legalized gambling a year ago but nothing's happening.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Hey, quit while you're ahead Carl.
CARL ELWAY => I know the guy. I know the right people who are going to help you out.
RICHIE DIMASO => Whose the guy?
CARL ELWAY => The guy is Carmine Polito.
RICHIE DIMASO => Whose Carmine Polito?
STODDARD THORSEN =>  Carmine Polito? Carmine Polito, no.
RICHIE DIMASO => My boss Stoddard proceeded to tell me that Carmine Polito was the most quietly powerful person in the state of New Jersey. A lifetime native of the very racially mixed Camden, which had become a ghetto, and where he had been Mayor for ten years. A very beloved guy. A guy who never gave up on his people. His father had emigrated from Italy and had stoked coal.
RICHIE DIMASO => A big family guy with five kids. They even adopted some other kid. A black kid from the Boys and Girls Club who'd lost his family. I mean, his household was a joyous place. And his wife Dolly, she was the apple of his eye and the center of the household. I mean everyone loved this guy.
RICHIE DIMASO => And he had a huge heart.
CARMINE POLITO =>  The W.P.A. employed craftsmen to paint this during the Depression. Why can't we employ people today to do work like this in rebuilding Atlantic City?
RICHIE DIMASO => He worked with all the unions. He was the leader of the State Assembly. And he had just gotten gambling legalized in New Jersey to create jobs.
RICHIE DIMASO => But he couldn't get the funds to rebuild Atlantic City and that was his problem. So with our help, he was about to have his hand in the wrong pocket at the wrong time. And to me that meant corrupt
STODDARD THORSEN => You said grifters and con artists. We're not going after some politician. This is a bad idea, Richard.
RICHIE DIMASO => Shhhh. Look, it's really simple. All you need is to put two million in a Chase account --
STODDARD THORSEN => What?!
RICHIE DIMASO => -- under the Sheik's name --
STODDARD THORSEN => Whose two million?!
RICHIE DIMASO => Shh, just listen. Two million dollars under the Sheik's name, in a Chase account that we control. Carmine calls up on the telephone -- calls the bank -- and he sees that the Sheik is real and he has a real account. Five days.
STODDARD THORSEN => I'm not taking two million dollars of the taxpayers' money and putting it anywhere for five days, I don't care if we control it the whole time.
RICHIE DIMASO => Stoddard, let us do what we need to do to rule out corruption and to get rid of the payoff guys that are ruining this country. That's my dream. Don't smother it, please.
STODDARD THORSEN => You know Richard, I understand your eagerness. I really do. You know I'm from Michigan, right? Let me tell you a story about me, and my dad, and my brother. We used to go ice fishing every November. Ice Fishing. That's what we lived for.
RICHIE DIMASO => Holy shit --
STODDARD THORSEN => Just listen to me. It's beautiful. You have a little stove. You huddle around, you keep each other warm. You drop a line and you just wait. One year my brother says, "let's go in October." He wants to go ice fishing in October. My dad says, "No, the ice is too thin." My brother says -- I love my brother he says --
RICHIE DIMASO => I understand what's happening. You're saying your brother went out on the ice, the ice was too thin, he fell through the ice, he went in the water because he was too eager, and you're saying I'm too eager -- that's what you're saying?
STODDARD THORSEN => No, that's not what I'm saying.
RICHIE DIMASO => What are you saying?
STODDARD THORSEN => We'll finish the ice fishing story another time, young man. For now, no Carmine Polito. Go do your job.
RICHIE DIMASO => Stoddard shot the whole thing down.
RICHIE DIMASO => Boring.
RICHIE DIMASO => But Edith was a genius.
RICHIE DIMASO => She somehow found this woman who controlled the wire room. A woman I'd never heard of. Way back in a warren buried in the Bureau. This cat lady nobody even talked to. Edith met her in the ladies room and became friends with her. This lady handled all the wires and now, she was working with us.
RICHIE DIMASO => She was excited to be included in an operation instead of being on the other end of a memo. It was beautiful.
EDITH GREENSLY => Brenda, hi!
BRENDA MCPHERSON => Hi!
EDITH GREENSLY => You said you liked exotic food, so that's from England.
BRENDA MCPHERSON => That's from England?
EDITH GREENSLY => That's right. And I brought you some tea as well.
BRENDA MCPHERSON => Thank you so much! Nobody ever tells me about these operations, they just say, "Brenda, do the clerical wiring work and don't ask questions."
EDITH GREENSLY => You need to tell Richie about your cats. He loves them.
BRENDA MCPHERSON => Oh my cats?!
BRENDA MCPHERSON => Well that's Harry -- look at him standing up, isn't that sweet? And that's Wendy. She's a rascal. But Barnaby, that's another story. Barnaby plays the piano!
RICHIE DIMASO => That's impressive.
RICHIE DIMASO => We got her to wire two million dollars into an F.B.I.-controlled account at Chase. It'd be there for five days and if Polito called he'd see that the Sheik was real.
RICHIE DIMASO => By the time Stoddard caught up to us Edith made sure his boss was impressed by my idea. So before he even knew it was happening his boss was calling to congratulate him.
ANTHONY AMADO => I'm very impressed. That was very smart. The Sheik with the money in the bank is a fantastic...don't be modest.
RICHIE DIMASO => Anthony Amado. He was the U.S. Attorney, and he had a major hard- on to make a name for himself. I mean this guy loved the idea of being famous. And Stoddard had to say it was his own idea or he'd look stupid in front of his boss.
STODDARD THORSEN => Thank you, sir, wait, the sheik --
STODDARD THORSEN => You made me accept praise from my boss who's thanking me for something that never shoulda happened! Something that I didn't approve!
RICHIE DIMASO => You should be happy. There's imaginative things happening in this office, alright? We're not just working in a box.
RICHIE DIMASO => We got the two million to put Carmine and the Sheik together.
STODDARD THORSEN => Punk.
RICHIE DIMASO => I liked being on this side of the line. But someone had been left out.
IRVING ROSENFELD => We succeeded because we stayed small. I got you Carl Elway. He bought stolen art, sold fake bank C.D.'s, that's enough. That's one. I get you three more -- no politicians.
RICHIE DIMASO => You're gonna do this because you got no choice. You work for me.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Now you keep changing the rules. You're gettin' a little power drunk, Richard. 
IRVING ROSENFELD => You want to tell him, Edith? You want to wake him up?
EDITH GREENSLY => Oh no, I said we shouldn't do any of it, Irving. You know I said that. So now I support Richie. He's got vision. Do it heavy or don't do it.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I mean, he's the one ruining America, not me.
RICHIE DIMASO => How the hell am I ruining America?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Because people just got over Watergate and Vietnam, alright? And you're gonna shit all over politicians again? And just because you want to be a big shot and get a promotion.
RICHIE DIMASO => No I'm thinking big. This is gonna be fantastic. We're doing video surveillance. I'm doing this from the feet up.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You will never do it properly because you got too much government attitude to be small and sleek. I'm like the fuckin' Vietcong, man. I'm in and I'm out. I was there the whole time -- you don't know it. That's the fucking art of becoming somebody who people can pin their beliefs and their dreams on. And you can't do it.
RICHIE DIMASO => How about a suite at the Sheraton Hotel?
IRVING ROSENFELD => For Carmine Polito and rebuilding Atlantic City?
RICHIE DIMASO => Why not?
IRVING ROSENFELD => You need a luxury hotel for the Sheik. Come on!
RICHIE DIMASO => Carmine does back door dealings all the time. We don't have a budget for that Irving!
IRVING ROSENFELD => You gotta knock the Mayor, the Speaker of the State Assembly -- you gotta knock him off of his fucking feet. He's gotta feel like he's out of his league. What you're offering, this deal, I mean, this is unheard of in the state of New Jersey, maybe even the whole fucking country. A sheik with hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild Atlantic City -- are you fuckin' kidding me? That's gigantic. And the Mayor, he's going to want to see cash, he's going to want to see it in an account, he's going to want to see it right now, and he will check. And that's why this meeting isn't happening, because to get millions, you need millions.
EDITH GREENSLY =>  We already did it.
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  What?
EDITH GREENSLY => We got the bureau to park 2 million for three days -- we got the account numbers.
IRVING ROSENFELD => `We' meaning you and him?
RICHIE DIMASO => Yeah we did it.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Really?
EDITH GREENSLY => Yeah, me and that guy.
RICHIE DIMASO => She showed me.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You showed him our thing? You did that without me? Are you kidding me?
EDITH GREENSLY => What are you going to do?
RICHIE DIMASO => You playing me? Are we doing this? Or you playing him? It'd be very bad for you if you're playing me.
EDITH GREENSLY => You're going to have to decide for yourself, kid, I just laid everything out on the table.
RICHIE DIMASO => This is all very exciting, I never knew life could be like this. You're wild. You know we're taking down a very important politician.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  
RICHIE DIMASO => This is agent Richard Dimaso, I'm placing $75,000 into this briefcase for Mayor Carmine Polito to procure casino license and building permits for Atlantic City.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Mr. Mayor -- Please stop. Listen, I apologize if that prick offended you. I really apologize.
CARMINE POLITO => Really, I'm all right, thank you. I'm okay.
IRVING ROSENFELD => No. I'm fucking embarrassed to be associated with that guy at all. Can I just say somethin' to you, please? Don't lose this opportunity to fuckin' Florida -- all right? -- because of some bullshit from that punk advisor with his diploma who could never get into the school that we come from. Don't lose that opportunity.
CARMINE POLITO => Where you from?
IRVING ROSENFELD => I'm from the Bronx. Grand Concourse, Hundred and Sixty-fourth Street.
CARMINE POLITO => I got a lot of friends that live up there. I go to Tomaso's on Arthur Avenue. You know Tomasos's?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Yeah, Tomaso's.
CARMINE POLITO => The spicy clams.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Yes. They're always good.
CARMINE POLITO => Oh, they're to fucking die for, those clams. I haven't been there in a while. I like that place.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Carmine -- can I call you Carmine? You know, Carmine -- (catches his breath) My fuckin' heart's going from running down the stairs -- I'm not used to running. There's a lotta green grass in that hotel room up there, alright? And all the deals would float through you. You get a serious piece on both ends. You do with that what you will. I live in the real world, I am a family man, I got mouths to feed and everything. But, you know, we just...we gotta grease you directly. No middlemen, no bullshit. It's the Arab way.
CARMINE POLITO => Yeah, look, I understand. It's a great opportunity. It's just I got a little thrown by going to have a meeting with somebody who ended up not being there, so --
IRVING ROSENFELD => Hey, listen, I was thrown as well.
CARMINE POLITO => I understand. I'll deal with you directly. I don't want any middleman or any of that bullshit.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Done.
CARMINE POLITO => I like you. Eye to eye. We can do business together.
CARMINE POLITO => How long do you know this guy? You work with this guy before?
IRVING ROSENFELD => I gotta work with him. He's the Sheik's man.
CARMINE POLITO => But I still need to meet the Sheik, okay?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Done.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I'm going out to dinner with Carmine and the wives in Camden.
RICHIE DIMASO => Who?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Carmine and myself and the wives.
RICHIE DIMASO => What?! Without me?!
IRVING ROSENFELD => He doesn't like you, what do you want from me, I got him to come back and take the money and you got him on tape alright? I can't make him like you. I did my job.
RICHIE DIMASO => Did you tell him you were working with me? That I'm the Sheik's associate?!
IRVING ROSENFELD => I just fucking told you he doesn't like you. I mean, let him have a night out with a human being for fuck's sake, he's going to jail soon. You're done with him. You got him on tape taking a bribe.
RICHIE DIMASO => Carmine has got to deal with me, Irving.
RICHIE DIMASO => We're gonna use Carmine. We're gonna use Carmine to get other people, that's what we're gonna do.
IRVING ROSENFELD => What?! Like who?!
RICHIE DIMASO => Carmine's gonna use the Sheik to pay off people.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Are you fuckin' nuts? What are you say--
RICHIE DIMASO => We're gonna let Carmine show the Sheik Atlantic City, how he's gonna renovate hotels, and see who shows up. Whoever the Sheik pays off for licenses and casinos, that's who we're gonna go after. We're gonna go after all of 'em!
IRVING ROSENFELD => More politicians? You realize how fuckin' dangerous that is? There's no fucking reasoning with you. 
IRVING ROSENFELD => Edith and I were so successful for so long because we kept it just small enough. You are takin' us to a very fucking dangerous place, with very serious numbers!
RICHIE DIMASO => If your that successful, how come you wound up in this room with me? Taking orders from me.
EDITH GREENSLY => You're taking your wife out to dinner? Your fucking wife? Did I just hear you correctly?
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's the one thing you heard me say?
EDITH GREENSLY => I just find it rather shocking that's all.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I get to handle two wives with one dinner, alright? I take Rosalyn out, she keeps her mouth shut, she sees that my work is legitimate, I get to keep my kid, and I get to keep  that fucking wife happy. Both wives happy.
RICHIE'S MOTHER => Richard! What are you doing? Don't eat in the bathroom, I told you so many times! And Diane brought Napoleons for dessert. Come out of the bathroom and pray!
RICHIE DIMASO => Oh my god, what did you do?
RICHIE'S MOTHER => Richard, the filter is broken in the fish tank. It's a problem.
RICHIE DIMASO => See, your job is to do the filter, Mom, mine is to do the gravel. When you don't do the filter right all the fish die. See?
RICHIE'S MOTHER => I can't get the top on that filter.
RICHIE DIMASO => I've gone over this a hundred times mom --
RICHIE'S MOTHER => -- and please help Richard to marry Diane so that I may have grandchildren and the Pope may have more followers. And please bless this food that we are about to eat -
RICHIE DIMASO => Yeah, hello?
EDITH GREENSLY => Hi.
RICHIE DIMASO => Who's this?
EDITH GREENSLY => It's Edith.
RICHIE'S MOTHER => Sit down and pray properly!
RICHIE DIMASO => Are you alright?
EDITH GREENSLY => Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just alone, you know? Irving's out with Carmine.
RICHIE DIMASO => That's right, he went out with Carmine and his wife. You must not feel so good about that.
RICHIE'S GIRLFRIEND => Richard, sit down!
EDITH GREENSLY => Wait who's there? Who are you with?
RICHIE DIMASO => Oh, no, it's just people.
RICHIE'S GIRLFRIEND => People? I'm your fiance! Richard!
EDITH GREENSLY => Oh, you've got a fiance. You're engaged.
RICHIE DIMASO => Well, I don't know, no fiance.    I don't know.
EDITH GREENSLY => You don't know if you have a fiance?
RICHIE DIMASO => I don't know --
EDITH GREENSLY => You don't know? You don't know if you have a fiance?
RICHIE'S MOTHER => The fish filter is broken!
RICHIE DIMASO => I don't. No.
EDITH GREENSLY => Hmm -- intersting.
RICHIE DIMASO => Hey, you want to get together?
RICHIE'S MOTHER => Richard, do something about the fish tank.
EDITH GREENSLY => Fifty-fourth Street?
RICHIE DIMASO => OK, fifty-fourth street.
EDITH GREENSLY => OK.
RICHIE DIMASO => That's what that phone call's about. Everybody thought, "Oh, Richie DiMaso's gonna stay in the office, pushing papers." That's not gonna happen, Mom. I'm outside in the field. I got people working for me. My ideas. I'm running the show. I'm the quarterback. And I'm not gonna settle for no one, Mom.
CARMINE POLITO => Rocco, you know like we do. The chicken very thin. You should see the way he does this chicken with the red sauce
DOLLY POLITO => It's beautiful.
CARMINE POLITO => Right? With the red sauce, the lemon--
DOLLY POLITO => It's the Piccata of the gods!
IRVING ROSENFELD => I believe that you should treat people the way that you want to be treated.
CARMINE POLITO => Right.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Didn't Jesus say that or something?
CARMINE POLITO => He may have.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Also, always take a favor over money. I think Jesus said that as well.
CARMINE POLITO =>  I don't know if he said the second one but he may have said the first one.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD =>  I chip them moving furniture, it's my obsession -- Moving, re- decorating, it makes me feel better like exercise. There's this top coat that you can only get from Switzerland and I don't know what I'm going to do because I'm running out of it but I LOVE the smell of it.
DOLLY POLITO => I can get that for you, of course.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => There's something, the topcoat, it's like perfumey but there's also something rotten? I know that sounds crazy, but I can't get enough of it.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => No, smell it. It's true. Dolly, historically the best perfumes in the world, they're all laced with something nasty and foul. It's true!
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Irving loves them. He can't get enough of them.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I can't get enough.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD =>  Carmine, sweet and sour. Rotten and delicious.
CARMINE POLITO => Smells like flowers.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Flowers, but with garbage.
CARMINE POLITO => You know what that is for me? It's coriander for me.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Irving loves it. He can't get enough. That's what hooks you. He always comes back for it.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I can't stop.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD =>  He's gonna say we have to talk business in five, four, three, two, one --
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  Dolly, can me and the mayor talk business here?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD =>  AHH-HA-HAHAAAAAAAAHHHHH!
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => No, don't do that it makes me look more drunk than I am! I'm not this drunk. Irving please don't make me go, I was just starting to have fun!
EDITH GREENSLY => Didn't your fiance want to come out tonight?
RICHIE DIMASO => Yeah, no, I don't know.
EDITH GREENSLY => I'm sorry, we don't have to talk about it. I was just teasing you.
RICHIE DIMASO => Do you ever think, how did I end up here? How did my life become this? You ever think that? And you wonder, am I ever gonna get to a better place or is this it? You ever feel like that?
EDITH GREENSLY => I do. I definitely know that.
EDITH GREENSLY => I'm sorry we don't have to go dancing. We can go have coffee or talk or something.
RICHIE DIMASO => No, I need this. Please, I need to go dancing with you.
RICHIE DIMASO => Please.
EDITH GREENSLY => OK baby, let's go dancing.
RICHIE DIMASO => I really fucking like you.
EDITH GREENSLY => I like you too. I want to live, alright. For real. No more fake shit. Alright?
EDITH GREENSLY => We're going to wait until we decide to go for love Richie. For real. That's when we fuck. Not till then, ok?
RICHIE DIMASO => OK.
EDITH GREENSLY => No more fake shit.
RICHIE DIMASO => No more fake shit.
EDITH GREENSLY => No more fake shit!
EDITH GREENSLY => Get out!
RICHIE DIMASO =>  I want to be fucking real!
EDITH GREENSLY => AHHHHHHH!
CARMINE POLITO =>  This guy right here, Irving Rosenfeld? You know what he's gonna do? He's gonna bring the Sheik to Atlantic City, where we can rebuild all those resorts there, put everybody back to work.
CARMINE POLITO => He's gonna get this community -- he's gonna get this state -- back on its feet where it belongs. Isn't that right? 
CARMINE POLITO => He's gonna grow our tax base and create thousands and thousands of jobs for everyone. You understand that? You know what that means?
JULIUS => To Irving.
GIRLS => To Irving!
CARMINE POLITO => This guy right here. He's got a big heart.
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  I'd just hate it if it didn't work out.
CARMINE POLITO => What do you mean? Of course it's going to work out. Guys like you and me? We dream and we build. We never give up. We never quit.
CARMINE POLITO => Can I ask you a question.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Sure.
CARMINE POLITO => Is the sheik black?
IRVING ROSENFELD => He's an Arab.
CARMINE POLITO => That's black, isn't it?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Why you asking?
CARMINE POLITO => Maybe it's a dumb question, but I was just wondering -- I would like to arrange for the Sheik to see Camden. To see the people of Camden. The people I serve. The people I love. Who are mostly black and Puerto Rican. I really want him to see how good this is going to be for the community, how ready we are for this opportunity, and he can see how far his dollar will go. You know what I mean? What do you think?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Yeah we can do that. He can see Camden.
CARMINE POLITO =>  Hey, I got something I wanna give to you.
IRVING ROSENFELD => For me?
CARMINE POLITO => I got you a gift. Let's get out of here. The girls are going to kill us I'm sure.
IRVING ROSENFELD => What is it?
CARMINE POLITO => It's a microwave. It heats up everything. Pasta, lasagna, meatballs, whatever.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Really?
CARMINE POLITO => It's science, yeah. That's how it heats up the food. It's scientific.
IRVING ROSENFELD => And you specifically bought this science oven for me.
CARMINE POLITO =>  Yes. A new friend.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Thank you.
CARMINE POLITO => Don't put metal in it. Come on, let's get out of here.
RICHIE DIMASO => I need a jet at Teeterboro.
RICHIE DIMASO => I need a jet at Teeterboro for the sheik.
STODDARD THORSEN => You don't need a jet. Let him walk to the curb at JFK.
RICHIE DIMASO => Stoddard, that's not how it works. You got to do it from the feet up.
STODDARD THORSEN => That doesn't mean anything. What's that mean?
RICHIE DIMASO => It means you gotta be committed! It means you gotta be committed to something in your life, for Christ's sake. I want a jet at Teterboro for the Sheik. It can be a small jet. It doesn't even have to take off, cause I know you're so worried about how much money the Bureau's gonna fucking spend. It can take off and land on the tarmac, okay?
STODDARD THORSEN => Alright, you can have a jet for an hour, but it takes off and lands at Teterboro.
RICHIE DIMASO => I got the jet?
STODDARD THORSEN => You got the jet.
RICHIE DIMASO => 110             Thank you.                                            110
RICHIE DIMASO => So tell me the rest of the ice fishing story.
STODDARD THORSEN => Where was I?
RICHIE DIMASO => Your father woke you up, it was a blizzard, it was Lake Canoga. Come on!
STODDARD THORSEN => Okay, well, my brother and I were on the ice and my father came out of the house and I could see him coming. He was holding a lantern, and it was in the blizzard and I knew he was gonna be angry. So I went to intercept my father because I knew if he saw what my brother was doing he was going to kill him.
RICHIE DIMASO => So you tried to protect your brother, but you couldn't and that's why you feel bad, because you're trying to protect me and you're worried about me. Is that what the story's about? About protection?
STODDARD THORSEN => No, it's not about protection.
RICHIE DIMASO => It's not about protection?
STODDARD THORSEN => No.
RICHIE DIMASO => Alright, fine.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD =>  "Don't put metal in the science oven, don't put metal in the science oven, Rosalyn"...always treats me like a fucking child. I'll do whatever I want.
DANNY =>  Another fire!
ROSALYN ROSENFELD =>  No, Danny, not that one! That one's empty! We gotta use the big one!
IRVING ROSENFELD => I told you not to put metal in the science oven. Why did you do that for?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Don't make such a big deal. Just get another one.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I don't want another one. I want the one that Carmine gave me.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => "I want the one Carmine gave me!" Carmine, Carmine, why don't you just marry Carmine, get a little gold microwave and put it on a chain around your neck. You want to be more like Carmine? Why don't you build something like he does, instead of all your empty deals that are just like your fucking science oven. You know I read that it takes all of the nutrition out of our food. It's empty, just like your deals. Empty, empty!
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's bullshit.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => It's not bullshit. I read it in an article. Look, by Paul Brodeur.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Bring something into this house that's gonna take all the nutrition out of our food and then light our house on fire? Thank God for me.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I don't think you should come to Carmine's party tonight. You look beautiful by the way.
EDITH GREENSLY => Don't look at me. Don't look at my legs, don't look at my hair, don't smell my hair, don't ask me how I am, don't talk to me outside of these roles, 'cause we're done.
IRVING ROSENFELD => What are you doing? Get under the umbrella. It's just that Carmine wants Rosalyn to come.
EDITH GREENSLY => I don't care. You weren't listening. I don't care if Rosalyn comes. Just do your job, okay? You're nothing to me until you're everything. I'm not Rosalyn. I'm not gonna put up with that shit.
RICHIE DIMASO => Now that's a fucking jet right?
IRVING ROSENFELD => It's good.
RICHIE DIMASO => That's the kinda moves you need to make.
RICHIE DIMASO => Paco, Richie Dimaso, good to meet you in person [shakes Paco's hand] - this is Irving Rosenfeld.
PACO HERNANDEZ => Paco Hernandez. Nice to meet you.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Paco? He's--wait, he's not a real Arab.
PACO HERNANDEZ => No. I'm Mexican. From Tuscon.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Wait, where's my guy? Where's Al from Queens?
RICHIE DIMASO => Who?
IRVING ROSENFELD => My friend from Queens. Where is he? What are you doing?
RICHIE DIMASO => I gotta hire an F.B.I. guy.
IRVING ROSENFELD => What are you--  You speak any Arabic?
PACO HERNANDEZ => Yeah.   Abdullah Ahmed.
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's it? That's all you got?
PACO HERNANDEZ => No, I have a couple phrases.
IRVING ROSENFELD => From the feet up, you motherfucker. What are you doing? Act normal. That's it. Like you can barely understand English. You can't speak it. You say as little as possible. You follow my lead. Alright?
PACO HERNANDEZ => Who's running this?    I thought you were running it.
RICHIE DIMASO => I am running this but you've gotta listen to him. He's the guy with the vision.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I've got the vision? You know what vision I had? You just kissing my girl outside. That's what vision I had.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  I thought you guys broke up. I'm giving you a compliment.
PACO HERNANDEZ => What's going on?
RICHIE DIMASO => Don't worry about it.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You got a knife. This is for the Mayor. You've got to present it to him. Look me in the eye. This means a lot to you. Right? That knife.
PACO HERNANDEZ => OK.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Play it. You present it. "Friendship for life," alright? You gotta feel it. Sacred. Can you do it?
PACO HERNANDEZ => Right. Sacred.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You gotta sell it.
RICHIE DIMASO => Sell it.
IRVING ROSENFELD => If you believe it's sacred, it's sacred.
RICHIE DIMASO => Listen to what he's saying.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Can you do it?
RICHIE DIMASO => It's the details. That's what makes this guy a genius.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Again? You compliment me again. What is this, rubbing salt in the wound?
RICHIE DIMASO => I'm complimenting you. Any other questions?
PACO HERNANDEZ => Yeah, I think the name of this operation is offensive.
RICHIE DIMASO => What?
PACO HERNANDEZ => Abscam. "Arab Scam?" It's racist.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Are you fucking kidding? What do you care? You're Mexican.
CARMINE POLITO => Hello Sheik, my friend. Welcome. On behalf of the great state of New Jersey I want to welcome you to New Jersey. I know that was redundant. I'm sorry. I'm just very nervous.
CARMINE POLITO =>  We have a great party planned for you this evening.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD =>  But what are you talking about, I can't go? I just did my hair and makeup and everything!
IRVING ROSENFELD => The Sheik's very particular. It's international cultural protocol.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => International protocol? What the fuck are you talking about?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Do not answer that!
ROSALYN ROSENFELD =>  Hello -- Robert Spencer? I don't know a Robert Spencer. What do you want?
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  Give it to me.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Who is that?
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  Look, I told you, for God's sake, I told you not to call here.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => What is that about?
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Two more federal agents tonight, OK?
IRVING ROSENFELD => No way.
RICHIE DIMASO => Yes. They're bodyguards for the Sheik.
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's too many people for me to control, no.
RICHIE DIMASO => Look. I'm in charge here, alright? Just do it.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Rosalyn, get off the extension!
ROSALYN ROSENFELD =>  I'm not on it!
IRVING ROSENFELD => Look, don't call here again, alright? Don't call at home.
RICHIE DIMASO => Alright?
IRVING ROSENFELD => OK.
RICHIE DIMASO => Good night.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Federal agents?
IRVING ROSENFELD => It's bodyguards for the visiting dignitary, that's all.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => What is it, an I.R.S. thing?     Like a tax investigation?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Why you gotta say that? I mean, that's why I can't invite you. It's too complicated. Listen, come on.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Are you in trouble?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Look, stop being so nosy.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Look at this shit.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I'm only nosy cause you never tell me anything.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Can we clean up this fridge? I mean, what are you causing trouble for all the time?
IRVING ROSENFELD => DO NOT ANSWER THAT--
ROSALYN ROSENFELD =>  HEL-LO- Oh, hi, Carmine. We were just talking about you. 
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Irving's being a mean, boring man saying that he doesn't want me to come tonight.
CARMINE POLITO => Tell him he's crazy!
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Well, I agree. Want to tell him yourself?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Gimme the phone, come on.
CARMINE POLITO => It wouldn't be a party without you!
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Can you imagine? Tell him yourself.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Hey, Carmie.
CARMINE POLITO => Irving, you're crazy! Your wife is coming, you kidding me? She's the life of the party! Everybody loves her.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I'm the life of the party!
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  Look, you know what she's like. She's unpredictable. She's just always --
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Hey, don't talk about me like that! What's Carmine saying?
IRVING ROSENFELD => I can't hear what he's saying.
CARMINE POLITO => Listen, Irving, it's very important that she come, you understand?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Carmine loves me.
CARMINE POLITO =>  This is a really big night for us, you understand? Come on, you gotta bring your wife. And Dolly's got somethin' special for her.
DOLLY POLITO => Tell her I got the nail polish for her.
CARMINE POLITO => See? Listen!
DOLLY POLITO => I got your nail polish for you, sweetie!
CARMINE POLITO => You see? Somethin' special for you. What is it? Tell me. I mean,  What is it, you got a girlfriend coming? Come on, I thought we were friends. You're not gonna tell me you got a girlfriend? This is ridiculous.
IRVING ROSENFELD => No, it's just Rosalyn's unpredictable.
CARMINE POLITO => Look, we're gonna handle this like men, you understand? You're bringing your wife. We're gonna have a good time. That's an order from the Mayor. Good-bye.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Alright, you happy? Go get ready.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Yes, I am happy.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD =>  I know who you are.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I know who that is Irving.
CARMINE POLITO => So this is the lobby. Now mind you, a week ago this place was a mess, but what existed was this plasterwork. Look at the detail. This is beautiful. My sons are craftsmen. Please, tell them what you did.
DOLLY POLITO => Tell them everything you know. The trompe l'oeil.
DOMINIC POLITO => Birds, sky, clouds, wood. Trompe l'oeil -- "Trick of the eye."
CARMINE POLITO => We can restore all of this, you see? You save 50 million -- look at me -- fifty million right off the bat -- I waive the law I helped write. It said casino construction must be ground up new, we don't do new. We renovate.
DOLLY POLITO => We don't do new. We renovate.
CARMINE POLITO => We put in some temporary fun -- some gaming tables, some play money for people to have a good time. For charity -- the Boys and Girls Club and some arts programs.
CARMINE POLITO => This is the Ocean Room --
CARMINE POLITO => There are some gentlemen over there at the bar. That's a hundred and thirty years sitting there -- that's how much time's between them. They run the biggest casinos in the United States. We have to work with them.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Right.
CARMINE POLITO => The good news is they know how it's done. They get it done. You don't have to worry. Everyone makes their money.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You mean the Mob?
CARMINE POLITO => Yes, but they're businessmen, okay? Now, spend as much or as little time with them as you like, but we do have to deal with them. All we've got to do is go say hello. We just gotta say hi, that's all.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Carmine, maybe -- I'm not sure that's such a good idea. We gotta confer before we talk to these guys.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Confer? What is there to confer about? They're casino guys.
CARMINE POLITO => They are businessmen.
RICHIE DIMASO => We came all this way, Irving. We should be here. What's everybody scared of? There's nothing to be scared of.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD =>  Those are the guys you're all scared of? Those guys over there? They don't scare me.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Rosalyn!
RICHIE DIMASO => I love this!
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Hi.   Can I sit here?
CARMINE POLITO => Irving, this is not a good idea.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => How you guys doing? Everybody over there is really scared of you guys, you know that?
DOLLY POLITO => Kids, I want you to go up and get some pizza and soda, please.
EDITH GREENSLY => It's a disaster.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I think they have this room all wrong.
PETE MUSANE => Yeah? What would you do?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I would do it in all black and gold and I would do this bar like a big, warm golden mirror.
DICK HELSING => Sounds beautiful.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Thank you.
PETE MUSANE => But you expect that from her because she's so beautiful --
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Oh stop.
DICK HELSING => Gorgeous.
PETE MUSANE => I love her hair, so I know I'm gonna love how she'd do the room --
RICHIE DIMASO => How do you do?
PETE MUSANE =>  I'm sorry is she your wife?
IRVING ROSENFELD => No, she's my wife. She's my wife.
CARMINE POLITO => Look at these fine gentleman.
PETE MUSANE => Carmine, there you are.
CARMINE POLITO => How you doing?
ROSALYN => It's because he's a party pooper. He's so boring.
PETE MUSANE => You have a very beautiful wife.
GUYS => Salud.
RICHIE DIMASO => May I present Sheik Abdullah, gentlemen, from Abu Dhabi. Sheik, these men are professionals, they run the best casinos in the United States.
PETE MUSANE => Mr. Sheik, as a sign of our seriousness, Mr. Tallegio came from Miami to meet you tonight.
CARMINE POLITO => Mr. Tallegio? Why didn't you tell me Mr. Tallegio was here?
PETE MUSANE => He's in the back room.
IRVING ROSENFELD => It's a sign of disrespect to do business on the first meeting.
RICHIE DIMASO => That's not true. I don't know what your talking about. He's got it all wrong.
DICK HELSING => Well, don't leave him back there in the back room waiting. Come on, let's go.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Hey Irving, I'm going to be having fun. Maybe it will be contagious.
VICTOR TELLEGIO => Carmine!
IRVING ROSENFELD => Victor Tellegio was from Miami. He was Meyer Lansky's right-hand man. In his prior reputation as an enforcer from twenty years ago, he was known to never bury a body because he felt it sent a stronger message to leave it in the street.
IRVING ROSENFELD => This is the guy we now had to deal with.
CARMINE POLITO => You sure you don't want to go into the Ocean Bar? It's really, it's beautiful in there.
VICTOR   TELLEGIO => I'm very happy I   don't have to go there. I like it   here. There's an exit. I'm like a   ghost. Nobody knows I'm here.
VICTOR TELLEGIO => Tell him I speak for our friends in Florida. We're very excited. It's been our lifelong dream to build casino resorts on the East Coast.
VICTOR TELLEGIO => You told him that? They didn't want the Jews to make money, they didn't want the Italians to make money, definitely don't want the blacks to make money. After the oil embargo -- the gasoline crisis -- the hijackings, the Olympics, they don't want to see Arabs make money, trust me, not on our soil. You can tell him this in your own way: I've been in the casino business forty years. It's scrutinized more carefully than any other business. Carmine made this legal, but we must be careful or they'll take it away.
CARMINE POLITO => So, Mister Tellegio, how do you think we should approach this? What do you want to do?
VICTOR TELLEGIO => If you want to get the gaming license and keep it we have to make our principal investor here, the Sheik, an American citizen.
CARMINE POLITO => To expedite citizenship -- well, that requires very special treatment.
VICTOR TELLEGIO => You would know the right people to do that, Carmine.
RICHIE DIMASO => Carmine knows everybody.
IRVING ROSENFELD => What are we talking about?
CARMINE POLITO => U.S. Senators. Congressmen.
RICHIE DIMASO => Wow, that's fantastic.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I say stay away from that. That's bad. That's trouble. No, that's not good.
RICHIE DIMASO => Irving please.
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's trouble.
VICTOR TELLEGIO => Who is this guy?  What are you, a farmer?
CARMINE POLITO => Mr. Tellegio, I'm sorry, this is Irving. New York businessman. Irving Rosenfeld.
VICTOR TELLEGIO => Irving, Irving. What's the matter, Irving? What's the problem?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Nothing. No problem.
VICTOR TELLEGIO => Don't get your balls in an uproar. Everything's fine, everything's good. It's all good. It's all good. I just hope the other part of this is all good. And real. Because we're real. You know that. You deal with us. We're a real organization. We deal with you, we don't know what we're dealing with.
VICTOR TALLEGIO => Where's he from?
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Abu Dhabi.
VICTOR TELLEGIO => Oh, he's from the Emirates.
RICHIE DIMASO => Yeah.
VICTOR TELLEGIO =>  (Can I count on you? You gotta be honest about this. Do you understand me? Good means good. No bullshit.)
VICTOR TELLEGIO =>  (Did you hear what I said? Do you want me to repeat it?)
VICTOR TELLEGIO => 
RICHIE DIMASO => Uh, I think, I think what he's --
VICTOR TELLEGIO => No, let him speak for himself.
CARMINE POLITO => No, I know him.
AL KOWALSKI => You guys are way too serious for a party! Hey, what are you drinking? You got a drink?
CARMINE =>  We're in a very serious meeting. I apologize.
AL KALOWSKI => I understand, you're in conference. You gotta come with me now. You got a speech to give. Everyone's waiting for you.
CARMINE POLITO => Al, I'll be right behind you, okay? Trust me.
SHEIK ABDULLAH =>  It is great doing business with you. The investment is real. It was a pleasure to meet you.
IRVING ROSENFELD => What are the odds of an Italian guy from Miami knowing Arabic? But it turns out he's got casino investments in the Mideast and he spent two years learning it to keep the upper hand.
VICTOR TELLEGIO => Listen to me carefully. If you're real, you put ten million in the bank of our choice in the next two weeks.
VICTOR TELLEGIO => Carmine, listen to me carefully, if you're real, you put ten million in the bank of our choice in the next two weeks or not only will the Sheik feel insulted, but our friends in Florida will feel deeply disrespected and so will I.
EDITH GREENSLY => Rosalyn, you need to come with me alright?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I don't need to come with you.
EDITH GREENSLY => You need to come with me. This needs to stop. Come on.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Oh, you think I should come with you?
EDITH GREENSLY => Yeah, you need to come with me right now.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Why don't you get your fucking hands off me, you fucking whore!
PETE MUSANE => Hey!
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => You're a whore.  This is my husband's whore!
EDITH GREENSLY => That's real nice.
DOLLY POLITO => We're not going to do this in the Ocean Room tonight. Not tonight. Please.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => This is my husbands whore!
DOLLY POLITO => You stay over here with me. Everybody just calm down. I don't know what's going on.
PETE MUSANE => You alright? Take it easy. These things happen. Whatever's meant to be will be.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => That's what I always say.
PETE MUSANE => You say that?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Yeah.
PETE MUSANE => See? Kindred spirits.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Whatever's meant to be will be.
PETE MUSANE => Whatever's meant to be will be.
EDITH GREENSLY => What the hell do you think you're doing?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => What the hell do I think I'm doing?! What the fuck do you think you're doing? You really gonna come in here and judge me for flirting with somebody after you've been fucking my husband for how many years?!
EDITH GREENSLY => You don't have any fucking clue what's going on!
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I got a ring on my finger. We have a child together.
EDITH GREENSLY => He doesn't love you Rosalyn he loves me. And you know it and I know it and he knows it. And it might be done now, but it was beautiful and it was real.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Stop.
EDITH GREENSLY => And we loved each other.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Shut up.
EDITH GREENSLY => You scare him, and you manipulate him, and you use your son!
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Well, he must like it on some level. He must want it because he keeps coming back for it. It's like that perfume that you love that you can't stop smelling, even when there's something sour in it. You can't get enough of it. But guess what, he's never gonna leave me. He's always going to want me, and I will make you so sorry, Edith. I will make you so sorry for what you've done to my family, mark my words.
EDITH GREENSLY => That is fucked up! I would never say anything that fucked up to anybody, but you do because you're gross inside, you're so fucked up and gross.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Oh, I'm gross inside?
EDITH GREENSLY => Yeah.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Maybe you're gross inside, with robbing people and all that shit that you do? Maybe we're both gross inside, that's what Irving loves about us. At least he's consistent with his women. You know, sometimes in life all you have are fucked up, poisonous choices.
EDITH GREENSLY => We need to talk! This is serious.
AL KALOWSKI => Ladies and gentlemen, your friend, the working man's friend, my friend, Mayor Carmine Polito!
CARMINE POLITO =>  Hello, Camden! Hello, New Jersey! Hello, Atlantic City! [CROWD ROARS] A lot of my friends been out of work [CROWD WHISTLES - BOOS] A lot of good hard working families just wanna WORK AND LIVE. There's no money nowhere. You gotta be kidding me! -- don't they remember who built this country? [CHEERS] The one thing we can all agree about in the State of New Jersey is that we never, ever give up! Do we?
CARMINE POLITO => Please, raise a glass with me to a new era that begins tonight. From me and my family, we thank you. For all the hard work that you've given us in the community. Look what you've done. This is beautiful! Thank you!
RICHIE DIMASO => Can I use your phone?
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Last night was insane. I got it all figured out.
STODDARD THORSEN =>  Stoddard Thorsen.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Listen, I need the Sherman Suite at the Plaza Hotel, okay?
STODDARD THORSEN =>  That's a whole floor of the hotel.
RICHIE DIMASO => I need a whole floor. I need it for my operation
STODDARD THORSEN =>  Stop calling it your operation, Richard. It's not your operation. And I'm not giving you a whole floor of the Plaza Hotel.
RICHIE DIMASO => I have members of Congress that are gonna come in right now to try to give the Sheik citizenship. They're taking bribes. This is happening right now. That's what's happening right now.
STODDARD THORSEN =>  Bribing members of Congress are you out of your fucking mind?
RICHIE DIMASO => Stoddard. Stoddard! Shut up! Listen! Do you know who Victor Tellegio is? Victor. Tellegio. Works for Meyer Lansky. You know who that is?
STODDARD THORSEN => I know who Victor Tellegio is.
RICHIE DIMASO => Resorts International! He wants ten million dollars. I have two weeks!
STODDARD THORSEN => You're not getting ten million dollars.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Just listen to me! You're not listening to me! I have two weeks! I have two weeks to put this thing together and I need you to get me the Sherman Suite at the Plaza Hotel. And your going to fucking do it!
STODDARD THORSEN => Lower your voice. You don't get to yell at me.
RICHIE DIMASO => Calm me down baby. You gotta calm me down.
RICHIE DIMASO => Baby let's do this. Let's do this right now. --
EDITH GREENSLY => No, no.
RICHIE DIMASO => I want to do this. You're fucking skin is glowing baby. Your skin is glowing.
EDITH GREENSLY => I'm not doing this with you. We're not going to do this unless we do it for real, alright?
RICHIE DIMASO => I want to do this now!
EDITH GREENSLY => That's what we agreed on so we're not going to do that alright? Alright? Where are you? You're acting all scary.
EDITH GREENSLY => Are you here with me?
RICHIE DIMASO =>  I love you. I love you. Look at me.  I'm in love with you. It is real now. I just said it so now's the time.
EDITH GREENSLY =>  You want the truth? You want real?
RICHIE DIMASO => I'm ready for real.
SYDNEY PROSSER =>  OK, this is real. Do you hear my voice? This is real. This is real. What you hear is real.
RICHIE DIMASO => What?
SYDNEY PROSSER => This is me.
RICHIE DIMASO => What do you mean? What are you doing an accent? An American accent?
EDITH GREENSLY => No. There is no English. There's only American. There is no English.
RICHIE DIMASO => What are you talking about? Stop it. You're Edith. You're Edith Greensly. I checked your records.
SYDNEY PROSSER => I falsified my records back to birth. I falsified them.
SYDNEY PROSSER => My name is Sydney Prosser, and I'm from Albuquerque, New Mexico. I'm not Edith Greensly. There is no Edith Greensly.
RICHIE DIMASO => You're -- freaking -- me -- out. No, you said in the stall that we were going to be real and that we weren't going to fake it.
SYDNEY PROSSER => I'm being real now. This is who I am. I'm Sydney Prosser. Ok?
RICHIE DIMASO => So -- why -- did you do an English accent after that?
SYDNEY PROSSER => I'm sorry I didn't tell you in the stall. 
SYDNEY PROSSER => I created Edith because I needed her to survive, okay? But I'm done with that now. I'm so fucking done with that. Like you do what you need to survive, right? You do it. You know, you live with your mom -- you have a fiance you don't even acknowledge, right? That's what you do. And you curl your hair in little fucking curlers, which is -- No, it's okay, you look good with it, but you know -- you have straight hair, so that's what you do to survive. You do all sorts of things, you know. We all do.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Please don't talk about that. I'm confused. I'm confused and --
SYDNEY PROSSER => I'm fucking confused too, alright?
RICHIE DIMASO => -- I think we should fuck, and then we'll feel it and we won't be confused anymore.
SYDNEY PROSSER => No -- I want to talk. I don't want to fuck.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Yes! Come on.
SYDNEY PROSSER => NO! I'm not fucking you. I'm not fucking fucking you!
RICHIE DIMASO => AHHH!
RICHIE DIMASO =>  SHIT!
IRVING ROSENFELD => Will you please step away from Edith. I'm asking you nicely please step away from Edith right now.
RICHIE DIMASO => What the fuck --
IRVING ROSENFELD => Step away from her. Please.
RICHIE DIMASO => You mean Sydney?
SYDNEY PROSSER => I told him. I'm sorry. I just don't give a fuck anymore, I don't give a fuck. I don't fucking care.
RICHIE DIMASO => Irving has a gun.
IRVING ROSENFELD => What Richie's gotten us into is worse then jail. I told you last night, don't sit down with those goons. And what? Now what? No one's getting ten million for Tellegio. It's over.
RICHIE DIMASO => I don't think so.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Because when Tellegio finds out what happened, do you think he's gonna go after me? I don't think so. Someone from the Bureau? 
RICHIE DIMASO => Think he's gonna go after a politician? He's gonna kill you. Then he's going to go after your son. And Sydney.
STODDARD THORSEN =>  Stoddard Thorsen.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  You're going to give me the Sherman Suite. The whole floor.
STODDARD THORSEN => That's a NO. I said no wacko.
RICHIE DIMASO => And you're going to tell me the point of that FUCKING fishing story.
STODDARD THORSEN => Not the way you're behaving.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  What's the matter with you? Where are you right now?
STODDARD THORSEN => What does that make a difference?
RICHIE DIMASO => Just tell me where the fuck you are.
STODDARD THORSEN => The field office on 61st street.
RICHIE DIMASO => I'm coming to 61st Street. Right now.
STODDARD THORSEN => You're going to do what?
RICHIE DIMASO => To beat -- your ass.
STODDARD THORSEN => You're going to what?
IRVING ROSENFELD => You were right. We should have gone away.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I should have gone away with you.
SYDNEY PROSSER => We were supposed to do it from the feet up like you always said. That's how we were meant to do it but you didn't do it like that. You didn't do it like that. You played it safe so there was always a danger you were going to end up with Rosalyn in the dead space, floating on some dead spaceship with the furniture and the curtains. And I was your life line out and you were mine and that was ok.
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  I wish I could get you back.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You know I can't do it without you. You know that. Come on. Me, you and Danny. Like we said.
SYDNEY PROSSER => Like I said. You never said that. I said that. We gotta get over on all these guys. That's what we need to be thinking about right now.
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's big. That's crazy. Whatever it is, it's got to be the best we've ever done.
STODDARD THORSEN =>  Agent Dimaso called me late at night on the 21st. I believe that he was intoxicated. He threatened me and I told him this was inappropriate. I told him procedures exist for reasons we must respect. This is the third such call I received from Agent Dimaso. He called me again the night of the 5th and he threatened to kill me. Subsequently he demanded that I allow him to use the Sherman Suite at the Plaza hotel for purposes of bribing members of congress.
RICHIE DIMASO => I am so sorry.
STODDARD THORSEN => I'm not finished. There's a lot more.
RICHIE DIMASO => I have nothing but the utmost respect for you as my mentor. (he reaches down and turns the tape recorder off) and as my --
STODDARD THORSEN =>  What are you doing?
RICHIE DIMASO => I just want to talk from my heart. I don't want it on record. I want to get vulnerable.
STODDARD THORSEN => Can I finish? Can I finish my statement?
RICHIE DIMASO => Of course. I respect you.
STODDARD THORSEN => I think you do other things besides respect me.
RICHIE DIMASO => It's just hard for me to control my passion. I'm a very passionate person.  You're from New York. You understand this. He goes ice fishing in the midwest.
STODDARD THORSEN => That was told to you in confidence.
RICHIE DIMASO => He's an ice fishing guy. Look at him.
RICHIE DIMASO => What are you doing pulling out your gun? Stop it. That's not you.
STODDARD THORSEN => No, it's me. This is me. It's me.
RICHIE DIMASO => Don't do something that you don't know anything about. Alright?
STODDARD THORSEN => DO NOT LOAD THAT GUN. YOU DROP THAT GUN.
RICHIE DIMASO => I'll show you how it's done. I'm not even going to hit you.
RICHIE DIMASO => Watch this fucko.
ANTHONY AMADO => So, you want to use the Sherman Suite? The entire floor?
STODDARD THORSEN => OH GOD.
RICHIE DIMASO => Yes! At the Plaza Hotel.
ANTHONY AMADO => What happened to the Mafia? I thought you were --
RICHIE DIMASO => This is where they intersect! This is where the two things intersect. The Politicians and the Mafia. Victor Tellegio's people who run resorts international --
ANTHONY AMADO => Victor Tellegio showed his face?
RICHIE DIMASO => Yes. I sat with him. I sat with Victor Tellegio. I hung out with him. We can get him. We can get his whole organization as well as getting any number of congressmen. I mean, that's just peeling the first layer of the onion.
ANTHONY AMADO => Wow. How you going to do that?
RICHIE DIMASO => We would get ten million dollars and put it into an account --
STODDARD THORSEN => TEN MILLION DOLLARS?! Ten Million dollars?
RICHIE DIMASO => And that's how we just let them know we're for real.
ANTHONY AMADO => What does he say he's gonna do for the ten million dollars? How are we trapping him?
RICHIE DIMASO => He promises to build casinos, handle the skims, do the licencing -
STODDARD THORSEN => And you have him on tape saying this. You have that right? No.
ANTHONY AMADO =>  I want you to find a safer way to get Victor Tellegio on a wire. No ten million dollars -- that's crazy.
STODDARD THORSEN => Thank you.
ANTHONY AMADO => Even to entrap Tellegio it's crazy. But you can have the Sherman Suite -
STODDARD THORSEN => NO.
ANTHONY AMADO => --Stoddard, please -- To go and get me some congressmen. Go get some congressmen taking bribes. I want to pinch us some congressmen, ok? You come back to me. I'm proud of you.
RICHIE DIMASO => Thank you.  And Stoddard.
STODDARD THORSEN =>  Good luck keeping your job, by the way, and staying out of jail -- and not being killed by the Mob. But other than that you're doing a great job.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  What's the end of the ice fishing story?
STODDARD THORSEN => I'm not telling you the end of the ice fishing story.
RICHIE DIMASO => I'm going to call your fucking brother and find out from him.
STODDARD THORSEN => My brother's dead.
RICHIE DIMASO => That's how it ends. He fell through the fucking ice.
STODDARD THORSEN =>  No it's not. He died a different way, many years later.
RICHIE DIMASO => Listen I know it's awkward and I just want to say I'm sorry, alright? I think we can stick together and still fulfill our goal. I mean, we got the Sherman Suite.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You got the whole floor?
RICHIE DIMASO => We got the whole floor, yeah.
EDITH GREENSLY => That's good.
RICHIE DIMASO => Yeah, you ok?
SYDNEY PROSSER => Yeah. You?
RICHIE DIMASO => It's alright. I got hit a little bit. My eye. It's a little blurry but I got drops at the pharmacy.
RICHIE DIMASO => Hey, you OK?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Yeah, I'm good --
RICHIE DIMASO => Listen, I'm sorry.
SYDNEY PROSSER => I'm sorry.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  I'm sorry Irving.
RICHIE DIMASO => You can put a camera here. And we get it all on film. You like it?
EDITH GREENSLY => I do.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Give me those flowers. 
RICHIE DIMASO => If we put the flower base here and put a camera in there we can get a clear shot of the couch there where we can put the congressmen.
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's right. That's the idea.
RICHIE DIMASO => And Carmine will go to jail after he delivers us the congressmen soon to be felons.
MELORA => Congressman O'Connell is on the phone --
CARMINE POLITO => I got to take this you guys everyone out please.
DOLLY POLITO => This is sad. It's just sad.
CARMINE POLITO => Dolly please, I gotta take this.
DOLLY POLITO => Ok, sorry. Everyone out. Go out.
CARMINE POLITO =>  Congressman, how you doing? It's Carmine. Tell me you're gonna be in Trenton this week. We have an amazing investment opportunity I'd like to discuss with you.
RICHIE DIMASO => I'm federal agent Richard Dimaso. I've placed seventy-five thousand dollars into this briefcase for Representative John O'Connell of the Ninth District.
CARMINE POLITO => Congressman, thank you for coming by, John --
RICHIE DIMASO => Representative O'Connell was contacted by Carmine Polito to ask if he could obtain rapid citizenship through an act of Congress for one Sheik Abdullah, investor.
CARMINE POLITO => You wanna talk jobs, investment, construction, if we can expedite a very wealthy man's citizenship --
RICHIE DIMASO => How you doing congressmen?
JOHN O'CONNELL => I'm excited to be here.
CARMINE POLITO => This brings the state back. I mean, how long we known each other? 
CARMINE POLITO => You know what this is gonna do for us? This is huge for the state of New Jersey. It stabilizes our economy.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Hotels. Restaurants. It's waiting to happen. Carmine sees it, this fucking thing is waiting to happen.
CARMINE POLITO => The goddamn bankers. Keeping their money on the sidelines. How we supposed to get anything done?
JOHN O'CONNELL => Bankers only put money in the game when they can reap insane profit.
RICHIE DIMASO => The only problem is this citizenship situation. I mean, we got to expedite it as soon as possible.
JOHN O'CONNELL => Yeah, well I'll tell you, you came to the right place.
JOHN O'CONNELL => I'll make it happen.
CARMINE POLITO => Hey, this is going to happen.
CARMINE POLITO => This is real. You understand? This is real. On my family. On my kids. On my life. On my work.
JOHN O'CONNELL => I know that, Carmine. You're a good man
RICHIE DIMASO =>  I'm federal agent Richard Dimaso. I am placing 75 thousand dollars in this brief case for one Representative Gerald Sanders of the 3rd district.
REP. SANDERS => I don't want to do anything illegal-
CARMINE POLITO => Please Gerry. Use it as a campaign donation. Whatever you want to do.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  I'm placing g $60,000 into an this brief case for one Congressman Eric Keshoygan of the 4th district --
ERIC KESHOYGAN => I'm going to do what I can to help Carmine.
RICHIE DIMASO => A $100,000 into this briefcase for two term United States Senator Horton Mitchell of New Jersey.
HORTON MITCHELL => Atlantic City. All the way down the shore. A mecca by the sea.
HORTON MITCHELL => Carmine you're beloved by your people. Your constituency is not even your constituency it's your family. That's what you represent, family.
CARMINE POLITO => One small thing we do for this man is a huge thing we do for the people of New Jersey. This is what we can leave behind.
CARMINE POLITO => Irving what are you doing?
RICHIE DIMASO => Where you going?
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  I just gotta go see a man about a dog.
CARMINE POLITO =>  I appreciate this. On my family. On my kids. This needs to happen. It's gotta happen. You've got my word
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  I want to save us. I want to save Carmine. It's fucking killing me.
SYDNEY PROSSER => You know the only way to help Carmine is through the Tellegio thing.
IRVING ROSENFELD => It's dangerous. We gotta get a wire in there. We gotta make him feel safe.
SYDNEY PROSSER => There's only one thing that can really fuck this up and that's your wife.
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  Yep.
PETE MUSANE => I don't like your husband. You're no good together. He doesn't appreciate you. Hey, it happens. It happened in my marriage. That's why I went to Miami. Sometimes you just gotta be tough. You gotta stand up and you gotta leave, you know?
PETE MUSANE => Sometimes you gotta let something die to let something live. You're too beautiful to be unhappy.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I know. I mean, I don't want to badmouth my husband, but let me badmouth my husband for a second. He just thinks that he knows everything and he's so full of shit. He's such a liar. He thinks that I'm stupid, but I'm not stupid. I hear him on the phone arguing. He loves Carmine, but he hates that other guy, that curly- headed I.R.S. guy, or whatever who's carting around my husband's ex-lover, that redheaded whore.
PETE MUSANE => IRS?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Anyway. You can see that it drives him crazy.
PETE MUSANE => You said IRS. What IRS guy? What are you talking bout?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I hear them on the phone. I think that he's got Irv in some sort of bind or something and he's making him do all of this stuff and so Irv and Carmine right now are at the Plaza Hotel throwing away all this money at like Congress or whatever. They're giving money to congress or something. I don't really know but I overheard it on the phone.
PETE MUSANE => You know I hate to do this to you but I have to go talk to your husband. My boss is already angry. You stay here I'm going to give you some money for a taxi home.
PETE MUSANE => You stay here. Get yourself some dessert. Finish the bottle of prosecco. I'm sorry.
PETE MUSANE => You alright?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD =>  I don't like change. It's really hard for me. Sometimes I think that I'll die before I change.
PETE MUSANE => It's gonna be okay. You're gonna come live with me in Miami.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => 164             Don't hurt him too bad. He's still                    164 Danny's father.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Life is ridiculous and I would never say anything bad about your father in front of you but your father is a sick son of a bitch.
DANNY => Daddy's a sick son of a bitch?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Don't repeat that. But yes.
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  ROSALYN! ROSALYN!
IRVING ROSENFELD => This is a real low in our relationship! You know where I was recently? I was in your boyfriend's fucking car! I saw your nail polish.
PETE MUSANE => What's this I hear about your curly haired friend working for the Government?
CARMINE POLITO => What?! Who said that?
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's bullshit!
PETE MUSANE => Your wife.
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's bullshit.
CARMINE POLITO => Rosalyn?
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  HE PUT A CANVAS BAG OVER MY HEAD!
CARMINE POLITO => Hey, what the fuck?! --
PETE MUSANE => Shut up. Shut the fuck up.
IRVING ROSENFELD => ARE YOU HAPPY NOW? BECAUSE HE IS TRYING TO KILL ME!
ROSALYN => What are you talking about?!
IRVING ROSENFELD => WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Get out of here! I'm not doing anything!
IRVING ROSENFELD => WHY ARE YOU TALKING SO MUCH? YOU'RE GOING TO GET US ALL KILLED!
IRVING ROSENFELD => Danny. Come here buddy alright? Go draw a picture or something.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => You're a real sick son of a bitch for screaming at me like that in front of Danny.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I'M A SICK SON OF A BITCH? YOU'RE TRYING TO GET ME FUCKING KILLED. OH MY GOD!! YOU DRIVE ME SO FUCKING CRAZY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! YOU'RE BOYFRIEND -- YOUR FUCKING BOYFRIEND WILL KILL ME, HE'LL KILL DANNY, AND HE'LL KILL YOU.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => STOP TALKING LIKE THAT!
IRVING ROSENFELD => He's a mobster alright? That's who you're dealing with.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Alright fine! Yes, I wanted to hurt you but how do you think that I feel all day when you leave me alone all day? And all I've ever wanted is for you to love me. That's all I ever wanted. And stay married and for you to love me. And that's why I'm going to Miami!
IRVING ROSENFELD => You're NOT going to Miami.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => That's why I'm going to Miami with Pete!
IRVING ROSENFELD => You are NOT going to Miami.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I finally found somebody who loves me just like YOU always wanted.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Too dangerous. Miami? Not now. Too dangerous.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => He likes me just the way I am.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Not now. Everything has to stay normal right now. And you're going to shut your mouth!
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => You told me that you wanted me to find a nice quiet man!
IRVING ROSENFELD => Oh and what a DOOZY you picked!
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => He's the one.
IRVING ROSENFELD => He's the most dangerous guy ever.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => WELL WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IRVING?! I KNOW EVERYBODY THROUGH YOU! WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE HAPPY FOR ME?!
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Why aren't you taking your heart pills? Irving, what's going on? What kind of trouble are you in?! What's happening?
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  I've got a plan.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => What's happening?
IRVING ROSENFELD => I've got a plan.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => You've got a plan? When did you get it?
IRVING ROSENFELD => It really fucking came to me when I was inside of that canvas bag with your boyfriend's hands around my throat. That's when it really came to me.
CARMINE POLITO => Take it off! Take the bag off his head!
IRVING ROSENFELD => We've got two million coming this week!
PETE MUSANE => What do you think this is? You think this is a fucking down payment plan? Like were Sears of Chevrolet?
IRVING ROSENFELD => You ask Victor if he wants two million this week. That's real money. Two million.
PETE MUSANE => Two million? How?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Wired in.
CARMINE POLITO => Is it true? Is it true what he said about your wife?
IRVING ROSENFELD => It's not fucking true. That's not true.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I can save all of us, and we can save money. I can take care of you and Danny. OK? But you gotta close your mouth.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I knew it. I have always said, Irving, that you are very, very hard to motivate properly. And I knew that Pete was gonna go over there and knock some sense into you. I've been reading this book, Irving. It's by Wayne Dyer, about the power of intention.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => And my intention in sending Pete over to you was so that you could come up with this plan. So, you're welcome.
IRVING ROSENFELD => OK. Thank you, Rosalyn. Thank you for the plan.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => You're welcome.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I appreciate that. So, I think that we should be partners on this.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I'm a good partner. Almost better than Edith. You ever think about that? You ever think about how you might have underestimated me?
IRVING ROSENFELD => So what is our plan? Tell me the plan. What are you gonna do?
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I'm going to keep my mouth shut and I'm not going to say anything but what do I do if Pete calls me? What am I supposed to say?
IRVING ROSENFELD => You gotta stop talking about your government agencies and your I.R.S. and your tax and your conspiracies and all of that. You're gonna say how you were wrong, you were wrong about that.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => I'll tell Pete that I was wrong but you know that in real life, I was right for saying all that stuff because then that spurred on the actions that made you come up with this plan. So I will tell Pete.
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  OK.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD =>  The power of intention Irving. The power of intention.
IRVING ROSENFELD => OK. You were right.
IRVING ROSENFELD => You're so smart. Good job, peaches.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Irving, I've been doing a lot of thinking and -- you need to grow up. And you need to face the facts. And I think that both of us will be a lot happier if we get a divorce.
IRVING ROSENFELD => OK.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Just think about it. These things are never easy.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Alright.
ROSALYN ROSENFELD => Irving. Good luck with your plan.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Necessity truly is the mother of invention. The F.B.I. was willing to wire the two million dollars if it meant taking down Tellegio and his entire organization.
IRVING ROSENFELD => A mobster like Tellegio would never meet at the Plaza Hotel, but only at the office of his attorney, Alfonse Simone.
ALFONSE SIMONE => Alfonse Simone.
EDITH GREENSLY => Edith Greensly.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Irving Rosenfeld.
RICHIE DIMASO => Good afternoon.
ALFONSE SIMONE => Please, be seated.
ALFONSE SIMONE => I appreciate the fact that you all came in person, but the trip was really unnecessary because this whole thing could have been done with a simple wire transfer. As a matter of fact this is the number of our wire right here.
RICHIE DIMASO => Where is Mr. Tellegio?
ALFONSE SIMONE => Mr. Tellegio unfortunately was called out of town on business.
RICHIE DIMASO => That's not good. We were willing to come here today, in person, to see Mr. Tellegio, as a sign of respect to give two million dollars --
ALFONSE SIMONE => I can assure you that I have the power of attorney --
RICHIE DIMASO => Excuse me. If you'll let me finish, we are willing to give two million dollars today of the ten. But without Mr. Tellegio here --
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  We can't, we can't make that decision. It's not the right thing. It's not the right time. It's just not good.
EDITH GREENSLY =>  You don't have the authorization to make this kind of choice so don't be hasty, alright?
IRVING ROSENFELD => I'm not being hasty. It's just, let's be smart about it. This is not how we do business. I'm sorry. I apologize.
RICHIE DIMASO => He's right, we can't.
EDITH GREENSLY => I think you should hang in there.
RICHIE DIMASO => For what? The guy's not here.
IRVING ROSENFELD => He isn't.
RICHIE DIMASO => That's it.
IRVING ROSENFELD => This is a surprise. The Sheik doesn't like surprises.
EDITH GREENSLY => Don't leave.
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  Edith, this is not your decision to make.
EDITH GREENSLY => I understand but maybe we can call the Sheik. Let's call the Sheik.
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's not the plan. That's not the --
RICHIE DIMASO => No, let's -- I'll call the Sheik. Can I use your phone?
ALFONSE SIMONE => Please do.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  I don't know if he's in, I'll call the Sheik. But before I do, I'd like to go over specifically what this money will be used for.
ALFONSE SIMONE => What we will do is we guarantee all proper licenses and construction permits for any hotel casino that plans to open before the end of the year.
ALFONSE SIMONE => And we'll throw in the customary privileges and protection.
RICHIE DIMASO => What if there are obstacles, what will you do?
ALFONSE SIMONE => Obstacles? We are prepared to overcome any obstacles.
RICHIE DIMASO => This is a big enterprise.
ALFONSE SIMONE => If we have to pay somebody off, we'll pay somebody off. If we have to lean on somebody, intimidate somebody, we'll intimidate somebody. We're experienced. This is our business.
RICHIE DIMASO => That's powerful stuff. Thank you.
ALFONSE SIMONE => And I'll tell you something else. At the end of this we'll teach you how to skim and how to cut it up and make some money on the side. Because we invented skimming. We've been doing it for thirty years.
RICHIE DIMASO => Thank you. Thank you for clarifying that.
RICHIE DIMASO => I think that will be OK for the Sheik.
ANTHONY AMADO => This is the Sheik.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Mr. Tellegio is not here. It's just Mr. Alfonse Simone, his lawyer. Are we still ok to wire the money?
ALFONSE SIMONE => Simone can take the money. What's the number?
RICHIE DIMASO => 5317AP
BRENDA => The funds have been transferred.
ANTHONY AMADO =>  The funds have been transferred.
RICHIE DIMASO => The money's been wired.
ALFONSE SIMONE => I think we have a deal.
RICHIE DIMASO => Yes we do sir.
ALFONSE SIMONE => Pleasure doing business with you.
RICHIE DIMASO => Okay, well, thank you very much, Mr. Simone.
RICHIE DIMASO => The Sheik's very excited.
ALFONSE SIMONE => I'm sure that we'll be seeing each other.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Oh I'm sure we'll be seeing each other very soon. You may even get sick of me, like these two.
ALFONSE SIMONE => I don't think I'll get sick of you. Nice meeting you.
RICHIE DIMASO => FINALLY! FINALLY WE GET SOME RESPECT!
ANTHONY AMADO =>  We're ambitious, that's why!
RICHIE DIMASO => Shh, shh, shh!
ALFONSE SIMONE => If we have to pay somebody off, we'll pay somebody off. If we have to lean on somebody, intimidate somebody, we'll intimidate somebody.
RICHIE DIMASO =>  -- If we have to lean on somebody, intimate somebody, we'll intimidate somebody!!
IRVING ROSENFELD => I gotta do it.
CARMINE POLITO => What do you mean, there's no sheik? What does that mean, "there's no sheik"? What does that mean?
IRVING ROSENFELD => I want to face you like a man because I want to be real now.
CARMINE POLITO => Who is "they"?
IRVING ROSENFELD => It's the Feds.
CARMINE POLITO => The Feds?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Yeah.
CARMINE POLITO => Irving -- I'm a good person
IRVING ROSENFELD => You are!
CARMINE POLITO => I've been doing this for a long time, for twenty years. Do you think I woulda taken that money if it wasn't the right thing to do?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Hey look, you're a good person I know that but in all honesty --
CARMINE POLITO =>  You said that was the only way, Irv. You chased me, remember?
IRVING ROSENFELD => They fuckin' made me do it. What was I supposed to do? They had Syd in jail.
CARMINE POLITO => You made me go back to the Plaza to take that money, you piece of shit! I was gone! You fucking prick!
CARMINE POLITO => I was gone, I left!
DOLLY POLITO => Is everything alright? Can I have a word with you?
CARMINE POLITO =>  No, please, Dolly, just go upstairs. Take the kids and go upstairs!
DOLLY POLITO => Alright, alright.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I want to make this right. I came here because I want to make it right.
CARMINE POLITO => Look at my face. You tell me that I'm lying to you when I say that everything I do is for the good of the people of New Jersey. Everything I do is for them. Am I lying to you?
IRVING ROSENFELD => I never had a friend like you before.
CARMINE POLITO => I used that money for the goddamn casino.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I got some leverage, alright? I can help you out.
CARMINE POLITO => This is all shit. It's all bullshit.
CARMINE POLITO => Look at this thing. Look at this. Ceremonial fucking knife. What is this bullshit? Some toy?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Carmine, Syd and I got a plan for you. We can help you out.
CARMINE POLITO => Please get out of my house, Irving. Will you please leave? I'm asking you nicely, please leave.
DOLLY POLITO => Get out of our house!
IRVING ROSENFELD => I don't want to -- I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen.
CARMINE POLITO =>  This is not our friend!
IRVING ROSENFELD => Truly, I didn't mean for this to happen.
CARMINE POLITO => This is what matters to me most and you're crushing it! You're going to take me away from them you fucking son of a bitch? Get the fuck out!
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  I just want to make it right.
CARMINE POLITO => Get out of my house. Look what you made me do!
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  I'm sorry Carmine, I'm sorry.
SYDNEY PROSSER => Irving!
SYDNEY PROSSER => Your heart pills. Where are your heart pills?
IRVING ROSENFELD => I've got to lay down.
SYDNEY PROSSER => Just rest.
SYDNEY PROSSER =>  Are you ready?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Yes.
IRVING ROSENFELD =>  I love you.
ANTHONY AMADO => Please. Come in. Sit down.
ANTHONY AMADO => Do you know where our two million dollars is?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Two million? (Irving pushes his new glasses up the bridge of his nose) It's with Victor Tellegio and Alfonse Simone.
ANTHONY AMADO => No, actually it's not with Victor Tellegio or Alfonse Simone.
RICHIE DIMASO => He fucking knows about it.
ANTHONY AMADO => It's gone missing. Did you know that?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Where's it gone?
ANTHONY AMADO => That's interesting that you said that because while you were on your way over here, we got an anonymous phone call from someone who said that in exchange for immunity for the two of you and a reduced sentence for Carmine Polito we get our two million dollars back.
IRVING ROSENFELD => That's interesting. That's very interesting. I have no idea.
ANTHONY AMADO => No idea?
IRVING ROSENFELD => No idea what you're talking about.
ANTHONY AMADO => I got it. I understand how these deals are made. See, someone has leverage.
RICHIE DIMASO => Anthony, fuck them. It's over. We got them for wire fraud, it's over. You're done. You're both done.
IRVING ROSENFELD => I don't think so.
RICHIE DIMASO => Oh, you don't think so?
IRVING ROSENFELD => Richard, think about it, YOU requested the two million. And you gave Brenda the account number. We didn't do any of that. None of it.  How do we know that YOU don't have the money?
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Am I living in a fucking nightmare right now?
IRVING ROSENFELD => I find this a little offensive. Really, I find this a little offensive and I don't see that you got any sort of solid case against--
RICHIE DIMASO =>  Don't let him get in your heads. Listen to me, we're dealing with a very clever individual.
IRVING ROSENFELD => Richard, think about it. You got some big arrests. You got U.S. Congressmen. You look good. You're gonna be all over the news. You know what doesn't look good? A story about gross incompetence
RICHIE DIMASO => I have a warrant for --
RICHIE DIMASO => I'm sorry, do I have the wrong office? Is this 701? Alfonse Simone?
MAN => This is 701.
SYDNEY PROSSER => You lost two million dollars of taxpayer money because you were confused about the location and the identity of Victor Tellegio's attorney?
IRVING ROSENFELD => The role of Tellegio's attorney, Alfonse Simone, was played by our friend Ed Malone --
IRVING ROSENFELD => the "Cold Cut King of Long Island"--
IRVING ROSENFELD => Whose party we were at when Sydney and I first met.
ED MALONE => Alfonse Simone.
EDITH GREENSLY => People believe what they want to believe Richie.
RICHIE DIMASO => That's because you conned me! You both fucking conned me. You both got under me. You did!
IRVING ROSENFELD => Well that doesn't sound so good, either. I mean -- and I don't know what you're talking about, but -- let's just assume you want to go with that story. Really? That's the story you want to go with? That's what you want the New York Times to hear? That you got conned by the very con men who you forced to entrap the members of Congress in the first place. That's what you want to go with? That doesn't sound so good for your whole thing.
IRVING ROSENFELD => And how ironic that the most creative minds, the ones who are working hardest to get the economy of New Jersey going, those are the ones that you round up. And why? Because what, they're the easiest to go after? And what about the real bullshit artists? You didn't even come close to the big leagues. Those big guys. The money men.
RICHIE DIMASO => That's what I was trying to go after.
