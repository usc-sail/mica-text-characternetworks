BOB COSTAS => Before the NBA was the NBA, there was another basketball league in America... DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: This is real ABA footage. A series of great plays are made by ABA stars.
BOB COSTAS => .From 1967 to 1976, there was the American Basketball Association. A maverick minor-league that would change the game forever. The ABA made the fast break FAST... Invented the three point shot... And introduced the world to something called the Slam Dunk Contest. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Dr. J launches from the foul line and dunks in the world's first dunk contest. David Thompson finishes an Alley Oop.
BOB COSTAS => Singer Pat Boone owned the Oakland Oaks. Wilt Chambelain coached the Conquistadors. I myself was the young voice of the St. Louis Spirits. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: A young Bob Costas broadcasts from St. Louis, looking pretty sweet in side burns and a tweed jacket.
BOB COSTAS => Players like Dr. J, Ice-man George Gervin and Moses Malone were as entertaining as they come. But despite the league's flair, convincing fans to show up for games was often a struggle. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: The infamous TV interview where Freddy Lewis wins a 'race horse.' Footage of 'Dime Beer Night.' Footage of the Kentucky Colonials fielding a cheerleader as one of their starting five.
BOB COSTAS => For owners, promotional ideas became an art form all to themselves. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: The Miami Ball Girls dance in bikinis .
BOB COSTAS => One night, the Nets went as far as to give a free gerbil to it's first fifty fans... There were plenty of punches too, giving the National Hockey League a run for it's money. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: A guy elbows Connie Hawkins, who turns and punches the guy in the face.
BOB COSTAS => Yes, the ABA had a style all it's own. The hair was big, the shorts were short and the ball was red, white and blue. DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE: Harry 'The fat Mexican guy' dances.
BOB COSTAS => In 1976, rumors of a merger spread throughout the league. In the end, only four teams would join the NBA and survive.
BOB COSTAS => Teams like the Kentucky Colonels and the Virginia Squires would disappear forever. But their spirit still lives on to this day.
BOB COSTAS => Here, we present the legend of the ABA... Exactly as it happened. Some FUNKY MUSIC plays.
BOB COSTAS => Except, this Flint Michigan team never existed.
LOU REDWOOD => WHAT!? Where's the foul on that? That was all ball.  Jesus Christ Leonard! Let them play for once! This ain't fuckin' Greenpeace!
LOU REDWOOD => 'Oh please. These refs SUCK. Still stuck in the crowd. Monix struggles to get back on the court. The crowd shoves him around, twisting his ankle, slapping him. The crowd is nuts.
DRUNK LADY => Hey Monix, want a sip? Monix is confused, until the woman throws the beer in his face.
DRUNK LADY =>  Oops. She and her friends laugh. Monix says nothing. Instead, he holds his aching back and limps up to the foul line, annoyed.
LOU REDWOOD => Yes! He just pegged a chick! That's the greatest thing I've ever seen. The lady runs on court and attacks Monix, her boyfriend jumps in -- Monix hits her boyfriend with some quick hockey punches. The benches clear, everyone is punching everybody.
LOU REDWOOD => I'm goin' in. Lou Redwood takes his headphones off, climbs over the announcer's table and jumps into the fight.
SCHNACK => Want one? SCHNACK, the owner, carries a six pack of Schlitz.
MONIX => I'll take two. Schnack hands them over. Monix might speak, but he drinks instead.
SCHNACK => So, Monix. The trade went through.
MONIX => Really?
SCHNACK => You know, you're not exactly a spring chicken anymore...
MONIX => Just tell me.
SCHNACK => That score board. ANGLE ON: Pieces of an old scoreboard are crammed into the back of the locker room.

CLARENCE => You like it?
CUSTOMER WOMAN => I guess it's fine.
CLARENCE => It ain't fine.  It's fine...
CLARENCE => Shit.  It's been a pleasure serving you. Clarence tosses his note pad on the table and his Mother tosses him his duffle bag.
MS. QUINCY => And don't think I didn't see those cotton briefs of yours in there.
CLARENCE => Stay outta my stuff!
MS. QUINCY => Don't you know our ancestors had to pick that cotton? Get yourself some silk underpants. Have some respect.
CLARENCE => Panties are silk. Briefs are cotton. I'm out of here.

DAAAAAAA. => MELINDA shakes her perfect measurements in the spotlight, then does a series of cartwheels.
JACKIE MOON => I'm living a dream, Flint and I know you are too.  AT GUARD, from Peoria Illinois, six foot one -- this guy's single and he can cook lasagna, I've seen him do it -- TWIGGY -- MUNSONNNNNNN! Bobby Dee hits the disco ball as TWIGGY trots out.

ROSCOVENSKIIIIIIII! =>  Vakidis, that's you man, I called your name.  VAKIDIS! C'mon dude, let's go, get it together. Players push the giant Vakidis out onto the court.
JACKIE MOON => Now this next guy, where do I start? First of all, that wife of his, she is... Wow.  CANONS, people. If you know what I'm saying. I don't think she's here tonight, but if she was you'd see what I'm talking about.

Yours truly... JACKIE M00000000N!!! Jackie takes off his blazer, twirls it, then tosses it off screen. It's game time. At center court, PLAYER/OWNER/COACH JACKIE huddles them up.
JACKIE MOON => Alright you guys, let's huddle up!  Vakidis! Where's he walking to? Kong, get Vakidis. A very short Asian man, KONG, nods. The uniform hangs on his tiny body.
KONG => You got it boss.
JACKIE MOON =>  Let's put on a good show tonight, okay? Let's keep it in the air, keep shooting, look for the baseball pass, launch some early threes to set the tone. Bee Bee, try and do that no-look behind your back thing, I love that, okay? Now let's bring it in. One two three--
JACKIE MOON =>  Hey, you lose weight, Father Pat?

JACKIE MOON => For safety. Just then, Vakidis jogs over, SLIPPING HORRIBLY in the puddle, ripping his groin.
BOBBY DEE =>  Okay Tropics fans, it's time to guess today's attendance... Is it A) 9,254. B) 10,506.. or C) 91 TIP OFF: The Tropics gain possession.

JACKIE MOON => Enough with the cheese already. More chips, less cheese, how many times do I have to tell you? WHISTLE! Jackie's been walking with the ball. FATHER PAT THE REF wears a holy collar with pin strips over it.
JACKIE MOON => Traveling!?... On who?
JACKIE MOON => That's bullshit, Father Pat! Jackie, furious, SLAMS THE BALL down on the floor.
BOBBY DEE => Ladies and gentleman, put your hands together for Downtown Funky- Stuff Malone! Clarence tosses the half eaten candy bar, wipes his hands off on his jersey and jogs right out onto the court during the game, TAGGING HIS TEAMMATE OUT as if it were pick up.
.CLAWS COACH =>  C'mon Father Pat, he's got to check into the game doesn't he? The ref just shrugs. Downtown calls for the ball and gets it.
LOU REDWOOD => People call him selfish. I call him the greatest show in shorts.
JACKIE MOON => Yes! Nice first half guys! That's what I call Flint Tropic's basketball!
JACKIE MOON => Let's stay focused on the four
'D'S' =>  Dangerous, Dangerous, Dangerous, Dunks. Remember: This isn't just a basketball team. It's a lifestyle.
CLARENCE => Yo, Jackie, is the washing machine broken? ANGLE ON: A few workers are taking out the washing machine.
JACKIE MOON => Listen up guys: I've got some good news and I've got some bad news. The good news is, we're getting rid of that piece of shit washing machine. The bad news is, everyone does their laundry at home from now on. Towels too. Everyone complains. Boo etc. Jackie turns to BOBBY DEE a 'front office' guy.
JACKIE MOON => And Bobby Dee, I need you to clean out your desk.
BOBBY DEE => No. I have kids.
JACKIE MOON => You're not fired. I sold your desk.
BOBBY DEE => Oh.
JACKIE MOON =>  And I'm going to shed a few lockers, so everyone's getting a locker buddy.
CLARENCE => Forget that. I need my own locker... For the panty dropper. Clarence reveals his 'panty dropper' a brown full-length leather coat.
JACKIE MOON => Fine. Now, there's one last thing: I've added some depth to the roster. I think he could deliver some firepower.
CLARENCE => Firepower? Who'd you hire?
JACKIE MOON => At guard, six one, the hometown kid, from your very own Flint Michigan -- He punches in bunches Ed MONIXXXXXXXX! We hear a TOILET FLUSH. Monix exits the bathroom stall buttoning his pants.
MONIX => You're out of toilet paper. Monix doesn't receive a warm welcome. It's more of a stare- off.
JACKIE MOON => Okay, now, I know everyone in this room has probably been punched in the face by Monix at one time or another.  One of you may have even had your collar bone broken, twice. But that's in the past now and-
BOBBY DEE => Yo, Jackie, you're on in two.
JACKIE MOON => Thanks Bobby.  I love half time.  Anyways, welcome aboard.
MONIX => So. Who wants to be my locker buddy?
little. => A giant five by ten check is propped up, with the words 'TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS' written in glitter.
JACKIE MOON => Ladies and Gentleman, this man is about to attempt the impossible. The $10,000 full court shot. So, tell me, what's your name?
DUKES => Dukes.
JACKIE MOON => Okay, Dukes. You feeling it?
DUKES => Yeah dude.
JACKIE MOON => What are you going to spend all of your money on if you win? A shirt?
DUKES => Yeah man, a shirt. Ha! Whoooo!
JACKIE MOON => Okay people, Dukes is excited. Let's get some clapping going as he prepares himself for the impossible.  This is drama, folks! C'mon now, let's hear it! The $10,000 shot people, let's hear it!!! For the first time, Dukes looks kind of serious. He sizes up the distant hoop...
JACKIE MOON =>  He looks ready... And... Here he goes! An uncoordinated baseball pass... Sailing off into the distance... And...
SWISH! => The crowd can't believe their eyes.
JACKIE MOON => Shit.
MIRACLE!! => Jackie is freaking out. Dukes has just won $10,000! Dukes runs around court, shirtless, leaping in celebration.
JACKIE MOON =>  Did he step on the line?
JACKIE MOON => Who the Hell has $10,000? I sure he stepped on the line, you know what I'm saying?
JACKIE MOON =>  Fuck me.
JACKIE MOON => 
THOUSAND DOLLARS! => 
LOU REDWOOD =>  I should hire his agent. Kyle listens to this and yells to the other room.
KYLE => Hey honey, guess who got traded to Flint?
LYNN => I don't know, who?
KYLE => Monix. The word Monix stops her in her tracks.
LYNN => Monix?
KYLE => Yeah! He's already got an NBA ring, but he's still playing... In Flint. Can you believe it?
LYNN => No, I can't. Lynn closes her book, fidgety...
KYLE => They say he asked to be traded. Who the Hell leaves California to come here? I love this guy.
JACKIE MOON =>  Get the funk outta-of-my-face... A SIGN SAYS: THE KREMLIN. Jackie rolls up and parks in a reserved parking space. He rolls up the windows and locks the doors by hand and exits.
COP => What's up Jackie?
JACKIE MOON => Not much.
COP =>  Your knees okay?
JACKIE MOON => Oh yeah. Just icing them down.
JACKIE MOON => Well look at you! You look beautiful. What's different?
JACKIE MOON => No, that's not it... Did your tits get bigger?
JACKIE MOON => Don't lie to me. Those things got bigger.
JACKIE MOON => Well, good job. Jackie keeps walking, bumping into MS. QUINCY, Clarence's mother.
MS. QUINCY => Yo Jackie. You know, that wife of yours has been making out with that Mark Spitz lookin' motherfucker all night. She gestures to a guy who's lip-locked with Jackie's wife. LUCY MOON unbuttons her fur coat.
JACKIE MOON => Oh. It's okay, Lucy and I've got an open relationship.
MS. QUINCY => I know that. But he's about to suck on her Damn tits, right here in front of all these people.
JACKIE MOON => She's hot right? What can I say, we're freedom lovers.  Hey honey! Lucy Moon ignores him, only making out harder.
JACKIE MOON =>  Right on!  I'm not jealous. It's a sweet deal for both of us.
MS. QUINCY => Have you ever slept with another woman?
JACKIE MOON => I could. That's the beauty of it. No ball and chain here.
MS. QUINCY => Have you ever been to an orgy?
JACKIE MOON => Pshh. Are you kidding? When haven't I been?
MONIX => I don't know, but it can't be good.
TWIGGY MUNSON => Hey, let's see that championship ring, Monix.
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => Yeah, you promised we could see the ice. Monix takes the ring out. It hangs from his neck.
MONIX => Look at this piece. It says Celtics right there in diamonds.
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => Why don't you wear it on your finger?
MONIX => I don't know, I just like to wear it around my neck, that's all. NOW CLARENCE chimes in without looking over...
CLARENCE => Not everyone sits around dreaming of playing in the NBA, you know.
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => Maybe not. But you do.
TWIGGY MUNSON => Yeah, that's all you ever talk about.
MONIX => You're not jealous, are you Clarence?
CLARENCE => No one calls me Clarence.
MONIX => Okay Downtown. I'll make sure Downtown is only referred to as Downtown, okay Downtown?
CLARENCE => Don't think I don't know what you're doing. You're doing that thing where you pretend to mean what you say, but you don't.
CLARENCE => Yeah. How'd you like that sarcasm smacked off your face?
MONIX => Bring it, funky stuff.
CLARENCE =>  I got this, alright? Monix squares off with a smile that says 'hit me.' Clarence takes off his leather full length and folds it nicely.
CLARENCE =>  How'd you like a knuckle sandwich?
MONIX => Knuckle sandwich? Who says that?
CLARENCE => I do motherfucker. I'm gonna pound you so hard, you're-- MONIX REARS HIS FIST BACK, about to release a strong Popeye
CLARENCE => 
GAYLE => Excuse me boys. You mind, if I borrow your friend for a minute?
JACKIE MOON =>  Hold on a second.
MELINDA => What's wrong?
JACKIE MOON => Where's the boogie? Jackie fights his way through the crowd to the DJ booth.
JACKIE MOON => 
JACKIE MOON => 
PATROL. => SCREECH -- The music stops.
JACKIE MOON =>  The year was 1973. A young musician named Jackie Moon, finishes years of musical training, only to find he is a slave to the notes on the page. He knows it's time to break free. In a sudden fit of creative mastery, he grabs a pen and a napkin and writes a song that breaks all the rules. Ladies and gentleman... Let's get sweaty. MUSIC CUE: Jackie's song. Everyone goes crazy.
JACKIE MOON =>  Baby, who wants to; love me sexy. baby, are you ready to; lick me sexy. Take off your shoes and; suck me sexy. Baby, we're naked and we're; humping sexy--
GAYLE => I'm glad they traded for you, I got myself a cute one.
MONIX => So, this is the Daiquiri room?
LUCY MOON => That's right. REVEAL: LUCY MOON, Jackie's wife, is on the couch. She's the hottest girl in the world.
LUCY MOON => What do you think, Gayle? Does he like it with my boots on, or does he like my boots off?
GAYLE => He seems like a boots on kind of guy.
LUCY MOON => Then it looks like I'm ready. As soon as you slide these shorts off of me.
MONIX => Aren't you Jackie's wife?
LUCY MOON => He knows about the Daiquiri room.
GAYLE => It's a new tradition we're starting, when new players join.
MONIX => I see. Well, I'm going to have to pass. I'm good, thanks.
LUCY MOON => Honey, you don't know what good is. With that, Lucy flicks on the stereo--
MONIX => Listen um... 
GAYLE => My name is 'no strings attached.'
LUCY MOON => You can call me Mrs. Moon. Gayle and Lucy perform a funky/seductive dance, moving closer and closer to Monix.
MONIX => I don't think this is going to happen, Mrs. Moon.
LUCY MOON => It has to.
GAYLE => It's bad luck if you don't.
MONIX => Yeah, I'd hate to bring bad luck to Flint Michigan. Lucy has sprayed some WHIP CREAM on her nipples.
LUCY MOON =>  Why don't you lick these clean for me?
MONIX => I can't eat dairy. Lucy decides that now is a good time to aggressively KISS him. Monix pushes her away.
MONIX => Nice tits, Mrs. Moon. I gotta go. Monix walks down the stairs.
LUCY MOON =>  I see what this is: You want us to send Eric and Marcus up here? On the way out, Monix flicks her off.
LYNN => Why are you here?
MONIX => I got traded.
LYNN => I mean, why are you here?
MONIX => Can we talk?
KYLE => --Yo, Monix, you're wasted! Ha! Kyle has come out to say hi.
MONIX => Yeah. Sorry man--
KYLE => What's up! That of jump shot of yours ain't broke yet, is it?
MONIX => No. Ha.
KYLE => Great back door cut for the lay-up in the third. That's how basketball should be played.
MONIX => Kyle, can you give us a second? We need to talk.
KYLE => No problem. Great game tonight man.
MONIX => Why does your boyfriend like me so much?
LYNN => You're his favorite player.
MONIX => Look, there are still some things I think we need to talk about.
LYNN => I've already said everything I'm ever going to say to you.
MONIX => I see.
MONIX => You're really not going to stop me?
LYNN => No. Monix walks more, until Lynn speaks.
LYNN => You're going to end up walking with a cane the rest of your life. You have to quit.
MONIX => And do what?
LYNN => I don't know... Kill yourself, I guess.
MONIX => Kill myself?
LYNN => You act like there's nothing else in the world besides basketball. If that's how you really feel, then go ahead and get it over with. I'm going to sleep.
MONIX => Thanks for the pep. talk.
LYNN => No problem.
MONIX => Lynn.  Can I ask you for one favor?
LYNN => You want a favor?
MONIX => My knee.
LYNN => Oh, Jesus Christ Monix. It's 4 a.m. Lynn stares at him in disbelief. Monix shrugs.
MONIX => No one here can drain it right.
LYNN => Fine. Monix nods, then makes a move toward the door.
LYNN => No. You're not coming in. We'll do it in the yard.
JACKIE MOON => (into the rear view, very
CIVILIZED) => Well, hello Commissioner -- Why sure, I would love one of your Puerto Rican cigars -- Oh, I know I'm a legitimate owner, you don't have to tell me that -- We're merging with the NBA? Oh, that's nice -- Ha Ha Ha! Good one, Commish ...
JACKIE MOON => Your Mom would be proud of you today.
COMMISH => .I'm sure each of you have heard the rumors. And I'm here to tell you, the rumors are true. The ABA will be merging with the NBA at the end of this season.
YES!!! => 
COMMISH => Our league is sold. And the NBA agreed to all of our financial demands! Now Jackie turns inward, more quietly intense. This is, without question, the greatest moment of his life.
JACKIE MOON =>  You're a real owner. You're in the
COMMISH => Four of our teams will be absorbed into the NBA family, the rest of you will terminate operations.
JACKIE MOON => Exactly! You know it!  I'm sorry, wait, what?
COMMISH => The Nuggets, The Nets, The Spurs and the Pacers will play in the NBA next year. The rest of us will dissolve.
JACKIE MOON => Dissolve? Dissolve, like, how? How do I dissolve into the NBA? The winning owners look at each other, not sure how to handle Jackie.
JACKIE MOON => What's happening?
COMMISH => I'm sorry Jackie. We all know how. emotional you get. We waited until the very last second to tell you. Jackie pounds the table.
JACKIE MOON => No. NO! NO!!! He kicks over his chair...
THE COMMISH => We know you're upset, Jackie. But you'll be very well compensated.
JACKIE MOON => I don't want a sum! I want my team!  C'mon you guys, you're not going to just sit here and take the money, are you? They are.
JACKIE MOON =>  What do the Spurs have that we don't?
THE COMMISH => A huge fan base. A brand new stadium. A solid economic growth package, including strong tax incentives.
JACKIE MOON => Oh, c'mon, that's BULLSHIT!
COMMISH => The NBA is taking four teams, Jackie, there's nothing I can do. Jackie goes quiet, thinking... An epic idea hits him.
JACKIE MOON => The best four teams should go.
COMMISH => What?
JACKIE MOON => Forget the huge fan base, the stadiums, the economic...  Growing... package... inventions...
COMMISH => These four teams DO have the best records. Flint's only won six games all year!
JACKIE MOON => So far. The season isn't over.
COMMISH => This plan sounds like a lot of fun, but it's too late. The commissioner, me, has already decided.
JACKIE MOON => YES. That's right. What he said.
JACKIE MOON => C'mon you guys, let's try to stay psyched. This is a chance to become a real NBA franchise!
CLARENCE => There's no way we can make it to fourth place. It's mathematically impossible.
JACKIE MOON => I ran the numbers. All we have to do is win about eighty-two percent of our remaining games.
CLARENCE => Eighty-two percent? Isn't that a lot?
JACKIE MOON => Oh, c'mon! We just gotta start hitting our threes.  Listen, I know this seems like bad news, but it doesn't have to be. This is a big road trip for us. We've just got to start playing solid Flint basketball.
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => I don't know. We suck, man.
JACKIE MOON =>  Sorry.
JACKIE MOON => We do not suck, okay? We just have to want it!
MONIX => I think we suck.
JACKIE MOON => Well... See, now there's some team unity! Now let's load up the jet. REVEAL: A SHITTY SCHOOL BUS has the words 'THE JET!' Spray- painted in graffiti letters with a palm tree next to it.
JACKIE MOON =>  Now we've got a special treat. You know I take care of my family. Today, the Jet is catered. I had Downtown's Mom pack us some hot dish.
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => Ah, watch the hot dish, man.
JACKIE MOON => Sorry Scootsie.
TWIGGY MUNSON => Hey Jackie, there's some dude out there, wants to talk to you. POV: Out the window, we can see DUKES, the full court shot winner, holding his GIANT CHECK and looking into the bus. He's still shirtless, with a star-spangled headband.
DUKES => I tried Jackie. They won't take it. They said it's 'symbolic.'
JACKIE MOON => What does symbolic mean?
DUKES => I don't know. But they said I need a real check.
JACKIE MOON => I don't know what your bank is talking about. That is a real check. I signed it myself.
DUKES => It's written in glitter, dude. Can't you just give me, like, a regular sized one?
JACKIE MOON => I don't get it. People are usually able to cash these. Maybe you should try another bank.  If you run into any more trouble, let me know.
DUKES => Okay Jackie, thanks man.
JACKIE MOON => Any time, congratulations. Jackie turns away from Dukes and exhales, walking back to the bus.
JACKIE => 
TO LIVE... => Pan back to see the whole team crammed into tiny seats. Vakidis has his knees pointing straight toward the ceiling. Twiggy Munson is reading '70's pornography. Clarence is sewing a new name onto his jersey. The rest of the guys are eating their hot dish.
MONIX => So, Clarence, what's in this 'hot dish' anyway?
CLARENCE => My Mom cooked your ass a whole Damn meal, why you gotta go asking what's in it?
MONIX => It's a compliment. It's good.
CLARENCE => If it's good, then it's good. Why do you gotta know what's in it? What's in hot dish? Hot dish is in hot dish, asshole. BEE BEE and SCOOTSIE look over the seat, facing them.
MONIX => They were fast.
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => Fast? No one's faster than me. I should be on the Celtics.
MONIX =>  Fast up here.
MONIX => Well, you have to be able to jump too.
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => Hey, let us see that ring again.
MONIX => Not right now, okay Twiggy?
CLARENCE => Isn't it a little embarrassing wearing that thing everyday?
MONIX => Embarrassing?
CLARENCE => You call yourself a Celtic? You sat through every single playoff game. You didn't see action once. And now you walk around wearing the ice like you're Bill Russel. Well you ain't.
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => Yeah, Monix played solid minutes, for lots of teams. He's played in the NBA, that's more than you can say.
CLARENCE => Whatever. At least I never sat on the bench and then called myself a champion. You didn't do shit for that Celtic team. If I was Dave Cowens, I'd yank that ring right off your neck. That was a pretty heated exchange. Monix looks like he's got something to say, but he doesn't. Clarence has the last word.
CLARENCE => He doesn't wear it on his finger because he knows he didn't earn it. He didn't even play.
JACKIE MOON => Alright. Now, a lot of people out there are writing us off. A lot people are saying things like 'Jackie Moon is an offensive liability.' They're saying 'Flint's turnovers led to sixty fast break points per game.'  They're saying 'Bee Bee's retarded brother is so retarded that his eyes look too big,. Like a French Bulldog.
JACKIE MOON =>  Yes they did. And we're going to use it as motivation, okay? THIS IS
JACKIE MOON => OH, C'MON!? Where's the charge, Father Pat?
JACKIE MOON => What!? What did I say? Jackie takes a ball and drop kicks it, PUNTING IT high up into the rafters.
CLARENCE => I ain't guarding my guy anymore.
CLARENCE => He's too'Damn sweaty, man.  Look at me.
MONIX => Quit talking and play defense! The sweaty guy backs in on Clarence, posting up top.
CLARENCE => Right on! I'm open baby! Try a behind-the-back! Monix delivers a nice two handed bounce pass, but Clarence isn't ready for anything fundamentally sound -- The ball hits him in the nuts.
CLARENCE => Ah, shit.
CLARENCE => I brought us some ice. Monix is startled. Clarence, his roommate for the night, enters.
MONIX => Ice? What for?
CLARENCE => I don't know, it's free. Clarence takes some ice, pops it in his mouth and starts crunching.
CLARENCE => Want some?
MONIX => No thanks. Now BEE BEE enters, yet another player in the small room.
MONIX => You turned off the Celtics?
CLARENCE => I don't watch people play basketball. They watch me. With that, Clarence pulls out a JOINT and lights it.
MONIX =>  What the Hell is that?
CLARENCE =>  It's a fucking Egg-McMuffin. Monix opens the window, clearing the pot smoke out of his face. JACKIE EXITS the bathroom, having just taken a shower. He's wearing a very small robe. This is now the fourth player who's sleeping in this tiny room.
MONIX => Why don't you shower in your room?
JACKIE MOON => My wife is using it. I'll be crashing with you guys tonight.
MONIX => Jackie, have you ever even slept with your wife?
MONIX => Sounds like a great arrangement.
JACKIE MOON => You guys need to wake up. Quit living like it's the 1950's, man. Live it up.  Hey Clarence, let's have some of that smoke, bro.
MONIX => I'm pretty sure we have a game tomorrow.
JACKIE MOON =>  This stuff won't affect you. It's premium. Jackie finishes inhaling, then holds it out for Monix. He stares at the joint, then around the room at his teammates.
MONIX => Well, if this is really going to be my life, I might as well be stoned like everyone else.
JACKIE MOON => Well said. Monix takes the stupid joint. The instant Monix inhales he
MONIX => What the Hell is this?
CLARENCE => What do you mean?
MONIX => It's harsh.
CLARENCE => Take that back.
MONIX => Take what back?
JACKIE MOON => His Mom grows it.
CLARENCE => Yeah, in the yard.
MONIX => Your Mom grew this?
CLARENCE => It's sweet grass.
MONIX => Well, I'm finished, thanks.
CLARENCE => What's wrong, my Mom's weed ain't good enough for you?
MONIX => I guess not.
JACKIE MOON => C'mon man, have some respect for his Mom's weed.
CLARENCE => That's it, I ain't sleeping in the same bed as this motherfucker.
lens. => Jackie studies the cameras, mesmerized by the idea of television. He speaks with the Amigo's manager.
AMIGO MANAGER => You want all the fans to sit on one side of the stadium?
JACKIE MOON => Yeah, just move all those people over to this side.
AMIGO MANAGER => Actually, that's not a bad idea. MEANWHILE, ON THE COURT: Both teams are warming up. Clarence now has a new name on his Jersey. There are so many words, there is barely space for a number. It's a mess.
CLARENCE =>  Check it out. I sewed it on the bus.
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY =>  What's it say?
CLARENCE => Jumping Johnny Johnson. The asshole, PETRELLI, wanders over near the Tropics side of the court.
PETRELLI => Yo, Granny Yarn Barn, how's the needle point going?
CLARENCE => Kiss my ass, Petrelli.
PETRELLI =>  Hey man, I think you spelled 'Flint sucks balls' wrong.
MONIX => No one calls him Clarence. His name
CLARENCE => Jumping Johnny Johnson.
MONIX => His name's Jumping Johnny Johnson.  You got that? Jackie hurries over.
JACKIE MOON => Alright, break it up.  Everyone huddle up!... VAKIDIS! OVER HERE. Where is he walking to?
JACKIE MOON => Hey! You guys want to merge or not? Because the fastest way to screw this up is to start punching people in the face while the commissioner is at home, watching the game with his kids... Children are very impressionable. Their minds are not yet soiled by the cruel realities of this world.
JACKIE MOON => No punching. Behind the huddle, FANS BEGIN WALKING RIGHT ACROSS THE COURT. Both teams turn to watch this strange thing. The Amigos manager leads the herd, Jackie helps out, directing them across to the other side.
ANNOUNCER => This sold out crowd is loving this one, the Amigos up by twenty-six here in the second. Monix drains a nice jumper, but out of nowhere, Petrelli, the guy we hate, throws a hard shoulder, knocking Monix to the floor.
MONIX => That's a moving pick Father Pat! C'mon!
Play on. => Monix can't believe it. Petrelli taunts Monix.
PETRELLI => What's wrong Monix, cat got your 'nads? Monix faces off.
MONIX => What about commercials?
JACKIE MOON => What?
MONIX => Commercials, what about commercials? Jackie thinks about this, then nods 'good idea.'
JACKIE MOON => I like it. Time out Ref!
ANNOUNCER => A time out on the floor, 5:20 left before the half, the Amigos 45, the Tropics 19, we'll be right back after this message from Shasta. The camera's on air' red light turns off.
CAMERA MAN =>  And... You're clear.
SHASTA COMMERCIAL =>  I want a pop... I want a -- Shasta...
KONG => Hi-Ya!
CAMERA MAN => And we're back in -5- 
-4- => 
-3- => 
-2- =>  
ANNOUNCER => Welcome back to the ABA game of the week... Players hold their heads in pain. Others limp back to the bench.
ANNOUNCER => .The camaraderie and spirit of this league is on full display here tonight... Off camera, Monix delivers a secret punch to Patrelli's spleen.
JACKIE MOON => Okay, solid first half guys, but we're going to have to make some
ADJ-- => Monix interrupts Jackie, pissed. He addresses the team, stepping in front of Jackie Moon.
MONIX => --This is bullshit guys. They're kicking our ass in basketball and they're kicking our ass during the commercials, too. Does anybody here understand the concept of the pick and roll? Because they're going to keep double teaming at the top of the key until somebody rotates the Damn ball...
JACKIE MOON => Yeah! C'mon guys! Rotate the ball. Monix looks at this group and gets even madder.
MONIX => Does anyone in this room have any pride? Don't you realize, this is thelast four weeks of basketball anyus are ever going to play?Is thishow we're really going togo out?You'd think we'd want toend ourcareers battling, hustling after every loose ball. Boxing out under the boards. Setting picks for our teammates. But we haven't done shit out there. Twiggy Munson and Scootsie Double-Day hang their heads.
MONIX => We're a bunch of selfish assholes -- And I've got news for you, we aren't going to finish in fourth, we're going to finish dead last. Monix paces in front of the guys, a man possessed.
MONIX => One day, you're going to look back on your life... And you're going to look back on this time... And you're going to realize... Monix is staring right at Clarence. And Clarence is actually listening...
MONIX => .You're going to realize you never even played basketball. A moment of silence after the intensity. Monix waddles to the door.
MONIX => Now, you guys have fun out there in the second half. If anyone needs me, I'll be in the training room, draining my knee. Monix limps off, everyone's head is hanging low.
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => He's right.
JACKIE MOON =>  Dukes! I don't make the rules. If they can't cash it, maybe you'll have to go out of state.
CLARENCE => Why do we have to put the court together?
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => I guess the Ice Capades sold out.
CLARENCE => Monix should be here helping us.
JACKIE MOON => Guys. The guys look up to find Jackie. He does not look happy.
JACKIE MOON => The commissioner just called.
CLARENCE => What's wrong?
JACKIE MOON => I looks like we've got ourselves a situation. We've got some new 'terms and conditions' for this merger deal.
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => What'd he say?
JACKIE MOON => Basically, we've got to average at least 2,000 fans per home game for the rest of the year.
TWIGGY MUNSON => 2,000 people? Every home game?
JACKIE MOON => He said the NBA will only take a franchise that has fans.
CLARENCE => Shit. Winning is going to be hard. But getting 2,000 people to watch is going to be impossible.
JACKIE MOON => Let's try and stay positive. My Mother always believed Flint was a town of destiny. And I believe that. Now, I've already started work on a huge idea to promote us.
CLARENCE => What kind of huge idea?
MONIX => Two more Johnny Walkers. And another pack of Kools.
BARTENDER => You could use some fresh air, Monix. You want to take a nap in the back of my truck?
BARTENDER => She asked me to tell you to quit going to her house.
MONIX => Well, tell her that's just fine with me.
BARTENDER => Okay. Sorry man.
CLARENCE => Monix. REVEAL: Clarence.
MONIX => Well, well, well, look who it is.  Brian, I'd like you to meet Jumping Johnny Downtown Funky stuff Boner- time finger-blast Fag-erton.
CLARENCE =>  Johnny for short.  Two coffees.
MONIX => So, what brings you to the The Kremlin?
CLARENCE => Listen, I know you and I haven't always been the best of buddies.
MONIX => I hate to break it to you, Clarence, but the Tropics will never play in the NBA.
CLARENCE => So maybe we won't. But like you said, I don't want to look back on this with any regrets. I know what you think of me. But I'm willing to put our differences aside. I'm telling you right now, I'll do whatever it takes to win.
MONIX => You mean, like, pass?
CLARENCE =>  I would consider passing, yes.
MONIX => Sorry kid. Even if I wanted to play harder, this knee won't let me.
CLARENCE => I'm not just talking about you playing point guard... I'm talking about you teaching us... Monix could not be less interested.
CLARENCE => Monix, you know more about basketball than any man who's ever set foot in Flint. Monix drinks, not into it...
CLARENCE => All I'm saying is, instead of getting so pissed off at us all the time, why not just show us what the Hell you're talking about? Coach us a little. I mean, we can't get any worse.
MONIX => And why should I give a shit about the Tropics?
CLARENCE => I know you. You've got all that basketball shit stored up in your head. I know you're dying to pass it down to somebody. Why not us?
MONIX => What about Jackie? He's the coach.
CLARENCE => Jackie's got his hands full, trying to sell tickets. He's obsessed. 
CLARENCE =>  I'm Johnny Johnson and I got the moves -- If you try and stop me, I'll just get smooth --
KONG =>  My name is Kong and I ain't five feet -- But I get more ass than a toilet seat --
JACKIE MOON => This is my team, so get to know them -- If you get near the lane I'll yank your scrotum --
BALL GIRLS => -- They're not here to talk no trash -- they're just here to do the Tropical Mash --
MONIX =>  Two more Johnny Walkers.
CLARENCE => So that's the way it's going to be? Monix doesn't answer, he just drinks. Clarence gets the hint and walks out.
LYNN => Looking good Monix.
MONIX => Thanks. You too.
LYNN => Ms. Quincy told me the Tropics asked you to coach them.
MONIX => I know what it takes to be a real team, Lynn.
LYNN =>  Stay still.
MONIX => It doesn't matter. The truth is, I hate basketball right now.
LYNN => Do you really hate basketball? Or do you hate yourself?
MONIX => Why would I hate myself?
LYNN => Well, for one, you cheated on me.
MONIX => You hate me for that. Not me. Lynn just stares at him.
MONIX => Okay, maybe I hate myself a little.
LYNN => You don't wear the ring around your neck anymore.  Where is it?
MONIX => I rode the bench through the playoffs, Lynn.
LYNN => Monix, that was greatest moment of your career. And you look back on it like some kind of embarrassment.
MONIX => Riding the bench was the greatest moment of my career?
LYNN => You did more than ride the bench, Monix.
MONIX => What else did I do?
LYNN => Every practice, you took your team to the limit. I know you did. I was the one draining this stupid knee of yours every night. The Celtics were practicing against you, Monix. And when you ran that scout team, you were running Milwaukee's offense better than their first stringers ever could. Lynn continues the business of disposing fluid into the toilet and preparing another syringe.
LYNN => By game time, your team knew where Milwaukee was going to be before their own players did. The Celtics made the right adjustments to win that series. And those adjustments came from you.
MONIX => So, I should be proud of running the scout team?
LYNN => Dave Cowens put that ring in the palm of your hand. And he told you to wear it with pride, because you were a champion. And he meant it too.
MONIX => He was being a nice guy. The bench is the bench.
LYNN => Your whole life, you've bitched about people playing selfish. It takes a team to win, right?
MONIX => That's right.
LYNN => But when you're on the team, your effort doesn't count? Is that it?
MONIX => Watch that needle.
LYNN => Answer me. Would they have won?
MONIX => I don't know.
LYNN => Yes you do. You know. Monix looks away for a moment.
MONIX => Why are you doing this? What does any of this matter, anyway?
LYNN => What's it matter? You're drinking yourself to death!
LYNN => I made sacrifices! How many years did I support you? And finally, after all of our blood and sweat and bullshit together, you got there, Monix! You made it, you won an NBA championship ring. It wasn't just about you, okay? And I'm sick of you acting like you're some kind of joke. You didn't blow it. You're not a fraud. You're not a fake champion. And all the time we spent together, fighting for you to get to that moment, was not a waste! You're a champion, you asshole!
JACKIE MOON => Nice leg kick Kong. Those flexible hips are a coach's dream.
CLARENCE => Are we going to practice or what?
JACKIE MOON => This is practice, okay Clarence? We need to get two thousand people in here! Our intro dance has to blow people's minds. He begins pacing around, more passionate than ever...
JACKIE MOON => From now on, I want our afros bigger... And shinier ... . I want our shorts shorter... And tighter... We're going to pull our tube socks up higher than we ever have before. The team seems to be looking off screen.
JACKIE MOON => What's wrong?
JACKIE MOON => Hey, you're back! Listen, you should probably chalk your hands up for this number.
CLARENCE => Jackie, I asked Monix to coach us.
JACKIE MOON => Coach? Jackie is totally thrown by this. He looks around at the team. Clearly, a decision has been made.
JACKIE MOON => What do you mean, coach?  What is this? What's going on?  It's a Mutiny.
CLARENCE => Jackie. Don't be like that.
JACKIE MOON => Hold on a second. Last time I checked, we didn't live in Flint, Russia. We live in Flint, America. I'm coach until a new one is elected.
CLARENCE => Don't make us elect Monix, man.  Alright, show of hands. Who wants Monix to step in as player-coach? Everyone feels bad, but they all raise their hands.
JACKIE MOON => Please God No.
TWIGGY MUNSON => Sorry Jackie.
JACKIE MOON =>  It's cool. I get it. I'm a big boy, I can handle it.
CLARENCE => Don't take it so hard, Jackie. You're a great owner. We all know that.
JACKIE MOON => Woah. Hold on. Did you just say 'great owner?'
CLARENCE => Yeah. Everyone thinks so.
JACKIE MOON => Now, when you said great owner, were you just saying that? Because it's not cool to mess with me about this.
CLARENCE => We mean it. For real. Monix is just more of an X's and O's kind of guy, that's all. Jackie is emotional. It's a bittersweet moment. He takes off his whistle, then walks over and hands Monix his whistle.
JACKIE MOON =>  Here. You may need this. Now he pulls out a bunch of crazy notes on loose paper written in ball point pen. The pages look insane.
JACKIE MOON =>  And here are some ideas for plays I've jotted down. Just thoughts.
MONIX => Thanks Jackie.  The way I see it, any team in this league can put together a run. Most of our opponents are all flash. If we play unselfish, fundamental basketball, we can win games.
JACKIE MOON => I like it. Unselfish, guys.
MONIX => Yes. Unselfish. Unselfish meaning tough team defense, full and half court traps, boxing your man out to help the team rebound.
JACKIE MOON => Wait, so, what's going on with the blow jobs?
JACKIE MOON =>  All in favor? Everyone raises their hands in favor of blow jobs.
CLARENCE => Would everyone let the man talk please? Clarence is serious. This shuts everyone up.
MONIX => The most important work we do on the court is away from the basketball. Monix FLIPS OPEN A SWITCH BLADE KNIFE AND STABS THE BALL, deflating it. This gets everyone's attention.
MONIX =>  Until you start moving like a real team, you practice without a ball.
MONIX => Alright, Clarence, run the offense.
CLARENCE => I don't get it.
MONIX => Set a pick for somebody. Clarence jogs over and stands next a scout team opponent.
MONIX => Okay, that's kind of a pick, I guess. Try standing on the other side of Scootsie's man, so you free him up to cut into the lane. Monix corrects Clarence, moving his body the way he wants him to stand.
MONIX => Widen your stance. Plant your feet. Hands back. Like this. Now Scootsie GO. Set a pick for Jackie. Scootsie cuts across the lane. The team slowly gets i rotating faster.
MONIX => Now Jackie pick Bee Bee's man, and rotate to the rim like this... Everyone move to the open space. And Clarence you swing back out up top. They've completed the play. Monix stands there, smiling. The players look at each other, what's the big deal?
MONIX => You know what that was?
CLARENCE => What.
MONIX => A flash to the high side post with an outside screen and a back door cut. Let's do it again.
MONIX => I'm saving my knee for the games. Coach's decision. NOW RUN. Clarence sets a screen for Scootsie and they perform the same basic rotation.
MONIX =>  We're not just rotating, we're clearing out, making space. A pass and cut can change defensive match- ups. Creating seams can give us back door looks. Down screens can make a team vulnerable to penetration.
JACKIE MOON => Hold on. I'm lost.
TWIGGY MUNSON => Yeah, what are we, building some kind of basketball space. ship?
MONIX => You don't have to understand it yet. Just run it again. You heard me -- AGAIN.
CLARENCE => We've been running this play for a long time, man.
JACKIE MOON => Yeah, maybe we could try, like, play number two.
MONIX => No. We're running this play. We're running this play until we puke.
JACKIE MOON => Yeah, I'm pretty beat.
MONIX => 'Until we puke' is not a figure of speech. We are literally going to puke.
JACKIE MOON => What does he mean by 'literally?'
CLARENCE => I think he's talking about vomit.
JACKIE MOON => Monix, can I talk to you for .a second?
MONIX => No. No talking.
JACKIE MOON => Wait...
GO! => Jackie hangs his head, but then accepts his fate. He runs.
MONIX =>  We need to get in shape fellas. And we need to learn some fundamentals quick. -- AGAIN! They run it again, getting more and more winded.
MONIX => I want you to be brain dead. Because someday you're going to be too tired, or too nervous to think - - AGAIN! And when you are, this is the play I'm going to call. The play that your lungs and legs will have memorized. We will be able to run this in our sleep. Clarence tries to gag himself with his fingers.
MONIX => HEY! No sticking your fingers down your throat, Clarence, I saw that. You're going to puke. And it's going to be all natural -- AGAIN!
JACKIE MOON => You're fired!
MONIX => Fuck you.
JACKIE MOON => Fuck you.
MONIX => Get up and run. You're going to puke like everybody else.
JACKIE MOON => Monix, I need to talk to you.
MONIX => We'll. talk after you puke. GO!
JACKIE MOON => I can't puke Monix!
MONIX => Yes you can. Go. Jackie crawls harder along the hardwood.
JACKIE MOON => Monix! You don't understand. I've never thrown up in my life.
MONIX => What are you talking about?
JACKIE MOON => I've never puked. Ever.
MONIX => That makes no sense. Everyone has thrown up before.
JACKIE MOON => I haven't. I swear to God. I can eat anything. I can drink anything. I've been sick, but I've never puked. I swear to God.
MONIX => That's bullshit. Keep moving, you're going to puke.
JACKIE MOON => I don't puke. I can't do it! It's the truth! I swear on my Mother's grave. At this point, Monix can't help but be intrigued.
MONIX => What about when you were a baby? Babies throw up all the time.
JACKIE MOON => My Mom said I never did. I swear. She said I was fascinating.
MONIX => No way.
JACKIE MOON => You can call my Dad! I've never puked. When Jackie looks up at Monix, it's clear he is not lying.
MONIX => Isn't that kind of dangerous?
JACKIE MOON => What do you mean?
MONIX => What happens if you swallow poison?
JACKIE MOON => I don't know. I ate bad sausage before. But nothing happened.
MONIX => Stand up. Jackie manages to stand up.
MONIX => Have you ever been punched in the Jejunum?
JACKIE MOON => I don't know. What's a Jejunum?
MONIX => It's part of your small intestine.
JACKIE MOON => I don't know. I doubt--
JACKIE MOON =>  Mom?
MONIX => You okay? Jackie is about to speak, but then takes stock of his feelings. There is now an air of tranquility about him. Reborn. He's almost Euphoric...
JACKIE MOON => I'm beautiful.
MONIX => .On offense, we share the ball. We look for the easy pass, not the spectacular pass... Jackie rolls off the pick and looks for it. For the first time in this sequence, we see the ball. Clarence has a clear passing lane -- He feeds Jackie for a lay up.
MONIX => . If a guy's more open than you are, he gets the ball... Instead of celebrating, Clarence hustles back on Defense. The Tropics execute a half court trap. As we watch Monix play, we continue to the voice over from practice...
MONIX => .On defense, we're going to learn to play together. We're going to use team traps to pressure people into turnovers. On the in bounds, Monix and Jackie Moon trap an opponent. Monix slaps the ball free. He flips to Clarence who fakes; the fast break dunk and dishes to Scootsie.
LOU REDWOOD => It was a great pass, too. The other team calls time out.
LOU REDWOOD => Like a retard in a China shop. A twenty-second time out on the floor, Monix huddles them up.
MONIX =>  Listen up. I'll in-bound. Clarence, protect the ball and penetrate if you can. Kick it out to Scootsie or me and everyone crash the boards hard. Looking good, we're thirty seconds away from taking this one home. Let's bring it in.
JACKIE MOON => He's right guys. But remember, we want to win, but not by too much.
TWIGGY MUNSON => We don't want to win by too much?
MONIX => What the Hell is he talking about?
CLARENCE => He's worried about the corn dogs.
MONIX => What?
CLARENCE => If we score a hundred points, everyone gets a free corn dog. There are signs everywhere.
JACKIE MOON => I'm sorry, Monix, but we don't even have corn dogs.
MONIX => I don't give a shit. We're taking it to them.
JACKIE MOON => We're up by seven, Monix. Can't we just take it easy? We're talking about a lot of corn dogs here.
MONIX => I don't give a shit about the corn dogs, okay? We play hard every second. We're running the offense. Everyone got that? Everyone nods. WHISTLE!
ANNOUNCER => The Tropics are just one bucket away from the magic number. Listen to this crowd. They know what's at stake: A free corn dog. Monix has the ball in his hands. He in bounds to Clarence. Clarence penetrates and kicks it to Scootsie. Scootsie has an open look. He sizes up a jumper...
LOU REDWOOD => Nice! The ball bounces into the air, rolls around the rim... And
JACKIE MOON => Shit.
JACKIE MOON => I asked you up to the Daiquiri room, because this is a private matter.  As you know, I threw up recently.
JACKIE MOON => In this bag, is ten thousand dollars.
DUKES => No way. Really?
JACKIE MOON => Actually, it's twenty three hundred. But I'm going to pay you the rest. The Tropics will not let you down. From now on, I want my conscience clear.
DUKES => Wow. Thanks Jackie.
JACKIE MOON => Can I confess something to everyone? It's something I've never told anybody.
CLARENCE => What is it?
JACKIE MOON => You know my song 'Love Me Sexy?'
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => Everyone knows that song.
JACKIE MOON => I stole it.
TWIGGY MUNSON => No.
JACKIE MOON => It's true.  My Mom wrote it. Three weeks before she died. And I stole it. Even Monix is fascinated by this.
JACKIE MOON => No, she wrote it on a napkin. I duped the whole world. I'm nothing but a fraud.
CLARENCE => Damn. VJ day? That's cold.
JACKIE MOON =>  And even on that day, I don't feel like it's me who's sleeping with her.
JACKIE MOON => She married me because of my song, but I didn't write it. So sometimes I feel like it's not even me who's with her.  Deep down, I feel like it's really my Mom who is making love to her. When I hold Lucy's supple breasts in my hands, they are my Mom's hands. When I eat a pair of edible panties off of her, they are my Mom's teeth.
DUKES => That's pretty weird.
JACKIE MOON => I'm living in a prison, Dukes.
CLARENCE => Why don't you write a song yourself? Then you wouldn't feel like a fake any more.
JACKIE MOON => Oh please! I could never write anything as brilliant as 'Love Me Sexy!'  Listen to me, Tropics. Today is a new day. I am going to be the greatest basketball owner you've ever seen. And we're going to make it to fourth place. MUSIC CUE: HOT CHOCOLATE 'EVERY 1's A WINNER.' MEGA-MONTAGE: THE TROPICAL FEVER SEQUENCE.

MONIX => Clarence, do me a favor, if you dunk the ball, don't dance afterwords. Act like you've been there before.
JACKIE MOON => Actually, Monix, I need him to dance. A lot. The fans need it.
MONIX => Fine, you can dance a little bit.
JACKIE MOON => If you dunk it, go fuckin' ape shit. -GAME TIME. CLARENCE DUNKS THE BALL: He immediately launches into a preposterous celebration: Back flip, 360 spin down to the splits, back up, he and Jackie give each other ten and then do an extended hand jive routine. Now Jackie blows Clarence a kiss, which 'knocks him out flat.' Clarence then poses, elbow on the floor, hand under his head, smiling.
BOBBY DEE => These beautiful girls reach a combined total of 47 feet... And here he comes... Jackie comes ROLLER-SKATING at high speed. He hits the jump -- It's going to be close --
BOBBY DEE => How about that!
OW. =>  No, keep doing'it.
BOBBY DEE => You sure boss?
JACKIE MOON => Just keep taping it up. I'm fine. Now the COMMISH  steps over.
COMMISH => Hey Jackie.
JACKIE MOON => Oh, hey Commish. 
COMMISH => Listen, my office has been getting your numbers. You claim you've had over two thousand people at every home game this month.
JACKIE MOON =>  That's correct. The commissioner looks around, skeptical. As we scan the stands, it's clear the crowd is still not big enough.
COMMISH => Well, we've counted only nine hundred and eighty three here tonight.
JACKIE MOON => What, you don't think people go to the bathroom?  Saturdays can be a little slow. You should have been here the other night, it was SO PACKED.
COMMISH => Don't bullshit me, Jackie. The commish waves over a little bald man in a suit. PEEKSKILL carries a brief case and never talks.
COMMISH => From now on, Peekskill here will be attending every Tropics home game. You're going to have to get a real crowd here if you want to qualify for the merger.
INTERVIEWER => So, the Tropics will be at a size disadvantage against the Americans. How do you intend to match up with their strong inside game?
JACKIE MOON => Tomorrow, at half time, I, Jackie Moon, will wrestle a bear.
INTERVIEWER => Oh, well there's something. But, defensively, as a team, do you
JACKIE MOON => --That's tomorrow! One night only! See Dewie the wrestling bear attack me. He's killed people in public before.
INTERVIEWER => Okay, well, that's some half time show.
INTERVIEWER => Well, there you have it. Jackie Moon, thanks for stopping by. From channel 5, this is Mick Kenterman, signing off. Good night.
notices something. => REVEAL: Monix is standing in the yard.
LYNN => Well, if it isn't the toast of Flint Michigan. Shouldn't you be out signing autographs? Monix doesn't speak... He stares into her eyes for a moment.
MONIX => Will you marry me?
LYNN => What?
MONIX => You heard me.
LYNN => Technically, we're still married right now, Monix.
MONIX => You know what I mean.
LYNN => Do I?
MONIX => Do you love me?
LYNN => Probably.
MONIX => Then let's do it. For real this time. I need you.
LYNN => Shit. I know you need me, Monix. The question is, do I need you?
YEAH. HA! =>  And I suppose you need him?
LYNN => He's loyal.
MONIX => Dogs are loyal.
LYNN => He ain't stupid, if that's what you're trying to say.
LYNN => Don't fuck with him. It's just rude.
MONIX => 
LYNN =>  What do you think you're doing?
KYLE =>  What's up. I forgot my stupid walle- -Kyle stops in his tracks. He HEARS a sound he's never truly heard before, Lynn having an orgasm. He slowly walks toward the bedroom. KYLE'S POV: Peeking around the corner, we spy Monix and Lynn still going at it. ON KYLE: His whole body goes numb, his face turns red... We hold on his face until:
KYLE => Monix?
LYNN =>  Stop that.
KYLE => Stop what?
LYNN =>  Ixne-on-the-erking off-je. Monix finally notices his sex partner is having a conversation. He turns to see Kyle.
MONIX => Woah. What the fuck?
KYLE => Monix, you of dog!
MONIX => What the Hell are you doing!?
KYLE => Hey, I'm the victim here. I'm allowed to do as I please. This was an honor.
LYNN => What? Monix stands up, wrapping a sheet around him.
MONIX => I'm outta here.
KYLE => Oh, c'mon man. Don't be like that. It's all cool.
MONIX => Believe me, this is not all cool.' Monix grabs his shit and walks out of the bedroom.
MONIX => I'll call you.
KYLE => Okay.
LYNN => Not you, asshole. He was talking to me.
OFFICER MILLER => Hey is that Coffee Black? I'm officer Miller, State Correctional, I'm a big fan, you can call me Jimmy.
CLARENCE => Nice to meet you.
OFFICER MILLER => Jackie Moon ordered up a bus full of prisoners. Any idea where we all should sit?
JACKIE MOON => I'm scared of bears, Clarence.
JACKIE MOON => I hate these things. I'm freaking out right now.
JACKIE MOON => Look at this place. We're packed. It was a good idea.
JACKIE MOON => You don't understand. I don't like bears. I'm feeling dizzy. Jackie is seriously petrified. Clarence adjusts the collar of his ref jersey and looks around, worried about his friend.
JACKIE MOON => NO. Look into my eyes.  You're the ref tonight. No matter what happens in there, do not stop the fight, okay?
BEAR HANDLER => Are you guys ready? The bear handler is a large frizzy haired woman.
JACKIE MOON => Yeah, let's do it.
BEAR HANDLER => You guys want to give me a safe word?
BEAR HANDLER => It's a word for you to yell to the Ref, so he can stop the match.
JACKIE MOON => I don't need a safe word.
BEAR HANDLER => Tell you what, if you get injured or you really feel like you're in danger, yell, um, I don't know... Spumoni. Once I get a signal from the ref, I'll come in.
JACKIE MOON => It's an Italian Gelato, sort of like Almond flavored ice cream.
JACKIE MOON => I don't know, I've never had it.
BEAR HANDLER => It's really good.  Okay, so Spumoni is the safe word then?
JACKIE MOON => No, I don't need a safe word, okay? Let's just do this. One round.  DING DING DING! The bell has rung. The crowd goes crazy. Clarence assumes his position as ref. Jackie walks slowly toward the bear, frightened. They bear scratches his belly, cute. Jackie immediately quits.
JACKIE MOON =>  Okay, fuck this.
JACKIE MOON => SPUMONI. I'm out of here.
JACKIE MOON => Well, too bad, I'm SPUMONI-ING. PEOPLE START TO BOO. Jackie looks around at the angry crowd.
JACKIE MOON =>  C'mon Dewie...  What's going on? Is he going to--
BEAR HANDLER => Woah-ho. I've never seen that before.
JACKIE MOON => 
ANIMAL HANDLER => 
JACKIE MOON => (screaming at the bear
BEAR HANDLER => 
BEAR HANDLER =>  Screw this, I'm stopping it. The bear handler tries to get into the ring with a stick and loop. But CLARENCE TRIES TO PUSH THE BEAR HANDLER back out of the ring.
SPUMONI!!! => DING! The first round is over, but the bear does not return to his corner.
LOU REDWOOD => A Mexican stole my bike.
COMMISH => Jackie.
JACKIE MOON => Oh, hey Commish. Good game huh? And a packed house too.
COMMISH => I need to talk to you... And the rest of your team. Alone.
COMMISH => I'm sorry, but even if you beat the Spurs on Friday, we just can't have an NBA franchise in Flint.
MONIX => What are you saying?
COMMISH => It's just not good business. Flint isn't a big enough media market, okay? This stadium is small and, frankly, it needs to be torn down before someone gets hurt. I'm sorry but nobody ever thought you guys could ever get this far.
CLARENCE => Well tough shit. This team did make it this far. Rules are rules.
COMMISH => Rules are rules... Until the expansion committee makes new rules. Then those rules are the rules. Everyone looks at each other. Jackie's brain has slipped into a deep trance. He is no longer inside his body.
COMMISH => Don't take this personally, Jackie. These other teams have strong markets, new stadiums. It's just not going to happen for you Flint boys. I'm sorry. The devastation of what is happening is palpable. Nothing has ever hurt this bad before.
COMMISH => I know you're going to punch me, Jackie. So let's just get it over with. The commissioner stands brave, eyes closed, chin out. Jackie is too confused and devastated to hit anything. He stumbles out of the room like a zombie. The team follows. The commissioner opens his eyes. A long silent beat...
COMMISH =>  How did I get out of that one? Suddenly KONG darts in and squeezes the commissioner's balls with a kung fu grip.
COMMISH => Ah!
TWIGGY MUNSON => This can't be happening.
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => We can get a lawyer, dude. We can fight this!... Can't we?... Monix? Monix just looks to the ground, as in 'it's over.'
JACKIE MOON => I don't know.  I'm trying to.  I wish I could just puke this away.  Do it to my Jejunum, Monix. Help me. But Monix is leaving. He turns and walks off, alone down the dark street... The others walk away too...
JACKIE MOON => Wait! Monix! Where is everyone going?...
LOU REDWOOD => At least someone from Flint is on his way to the NBA next year.
CLARENCE => Thought I might find you here.  I got traded.
MONIX => Yeah, I heard.
CLARENCE => I guess the San Antonio Spurs are picking up the players they want, before we're eligible for the expansion draft.
MONIX => Coffee Black, going to the NBA...
CLARENCE => They won't let me finish out with the Tropics. So, we'll be playing against each other in the last game. That's pretty weird.
MONIX => It won't be weird. The game doesn't count.
CLARENCE => Listen I'm sorry about--
MONIX => Don't be sorry.
CLARENCE => I mean, I just want to say that, this year, you really--
MONIX => --DON'T. Alright? Just don't. Clarence stares at him. Then eventually stands up to leave. There are a million things he wants to say, but he says this:
CLARENCE => We worked so hard.
MONIX => Well, it was all for nothing.
CLARENCE => So, that's just it then?
MONIX => That's just it. Clarence shakes his head and walks out.
LYNN => What the fuck are you doing?
MONIX => Oh. Hey Lynn.
his beer. => Now LYNN walks in.
LYNN => I thought the deal was, you were going to sleep.
MONIX => Pshh. Relax.
LYNN => So, you're just going to sit here in my house and drink for the entire day?
MONIX => You got a problem with that?
LYNN => Yeah, I do. Maybe you could put some pants on and go piss off somebody else.
MONIX => Fine, maybe I will!
LYNN => Tell me something, Monix-
MONIX => No.
LYNN => Whatwereyou trying to accomplish thisyear?You never really gave a shitaboutthat NBA merger, did you? Monix doesn't say anything.
LYNN => The merger, Monix, did you ever care about it? Monix still stays quiet.
LYNN => Tell me, if you didn't care about the merger, what the Hell were you playing for!?
MONIX => I wanted fourth place! Okay? That was the whole fucking thing!
LYNN => Well, guess what! Fourth place is still sitting there, waiting for you to win it! Monix doesn't look at her.
LYNN => Think about it.
JACKIE MOON =>  Baby, who wants to- love me sexy! baby, Ugh, are you ready to; lick me sexy!!!? Yeah yeah!! HA! INSIDE A DUMPSTER, REVEAL: Jackie lays in garbage and sings up to the sky. It's official, he has lost his mind.
JACKIE MOON =>  I'm a big faker and I stole this; Song-ly sexy. I'm the biggest failure in the; world-ly sexy. I'm going to kill my; self-y sexy.
JACKIE MOON => I'm going to hang myself with an extension; cord-y sexy.
JACKIE MOON =>  I am urinating in my pants right now.
MONIX => Listen up. We all know that Clarence has been traded. And we all know that this game doesn't matter anymore, right?
MONIX => Well I've got news for you. This game does matter. It matters because this is the last real basketball game any of us is ever going to play. Ever. The guys nod, solemn.
MONIX => Tomorrow night, I say we leave it all out there on the floor. Because there's nothing else for us to save it for. Clarence or no Clarence. NBA or no NBA. Merger or no merger. We decided we are going to win fourth place. And that's what we're going to do. Jackie is moved. The guys look at each other and nod.
MONIX => Over the past five weeks, we've become a team. And that is no small thing. Jackie, have you ever been on a real team before?
JACKIE MOON => No sir.
MONIX => How does it feel?
JACKIE MOON => It feels pretty good.
MONIX => All your lives, you've dreamed of playing in the NBA. Well, guess what? Tomorrow night, you are. You're playing an NBA team. And for one night, the world is going to know that you belong.
MONIX => But the truth is, I want this more than anything I've ever wanted in my whole fucked-up life.
PROMOTE! => 
FOURTH PLACE! => Pumped, they jump around, ready to make their own history.
JACKIE MOON => The Spurs may be the #1 team in the league, but they're going to have to prove it on Friday night.
TV ANNOUNCER => Since this game doesn't count, Jackie. What exactly is your motivation?
JACKIE MOON =>  We.'re going to win this game, because we want it. It's as simple as that. That alone should make people want to show up and root for us. Jackie and the announcer look at each other for a long moment of silence...
JACKIE MOON => Plus, this is the FLINT MICHIGAN
TV ANNOUNCER => What?
JACKIE MOON => Save your ticket stubs, the mega- bowl is an historic event.
TV ANNOUNCER => I'm not sure I understand.
JACKIE MOON => It's a Mega-Bowl. What's not to understand?
TV ANNOUNCER => This game has no effect on--
JACKIE MOON => --The Mega Bowl trophy is twelve feet high. AND IT IS GLORIOUS.
TV ANNOUNCER => I'm sorry, but this sounds like something you just made up.
JACKIE MOON => Well, I didn't.
TV ANNOUNCER => Well, it doesn't make any sense. They're just words.
JACKIE MOON => Oh please. You're just words. 
LOU REDWOOD => i will stab him in the stomach with an eight inch hunting knife.
PETRELLI => We may be teammates, but I still think you're a dick.
CLARENCE => Thanks Petrelli.
MONIX => You want to know what I love? This. The eleven of us right here, right now, waiting for the biggest game of our lives to begin.
powered. => QUICK CUTS: PETRELLI knocks over Monix and scores. -The Tropics offense is getting shut down. -Jackie gets a rebound, but then dribbles off his ankle. -The fans are disappointed. The guys in the Tropical Aisle are all bummed out. Wheelchair Jody looks pissed.
SPURS COACH => Coffee Black, you're going in.
CLARENCE => I can't. I've got back spasms. The coach stares him down, then picks another player.
LOU REDWOOD => Yep. It's a shit fucking sandwich.
LOU REDWOOD => Oh, please, this is our last game. I can say whatever I want. Watch this: I hope Gerald Ford gets ass raped.
LYNN => Oh my God. Everyone in the stadium watches as Jackie lays out cold.
SPURS COACH => Do not leave this bench, Coffee. BEE BEE leans over Jackie, worried.
LOU REDWOOD => I don't want to speculate, but I'm pretty sure he's dead. MONIX gets in Petrelli's face.
MONIX => What are you trying to prove Petrelli? You afraid to play basketball?
PETRELLI => Hey, check the scoreboard. Monix attacks Petrelli.
SPURS COACH => Where the Hell are you going?
CLARENCE => I'm going to my team.
SPURS COACH => This is your team. You are not leaving this bench. From the front row, the COMMISSIONER hears all of this and stands up, surrounded by security guards.
COMMISH => You sit down! You're not playing with those idiots ever again. If you walk away from this bench now, you're never coming back. I'll see to it you never play in the NBA! Ever! Do you understand what I'm saying to you, Coffee?
CLARENCE => My name ain't Coffee. It's Clarence. With that, Clarence walks across the floor. The crowd erupts.
TWIGGY MUNSON => Clarence!
CLARENCE => Is he okay?
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => I don't know.
MONIX => What the Hell are you doing here?
CLARENCE => I'm with you guys.
MONIX => Are you out of your mind? You want to lose your NBA contract? Get out of here.
CLARENCE => No.
MONIX => You're going to give up the NBA for this?  Well, you're a fucking asshole.  Jackie. Are you okay buddy? Monix cracks a smelling salt and waves it over Jackie's face.
JACKIE MOON =>  Yes Mother. You are so kind.
JACKIE MOON => I don't want to leave this place. It's so fluffy. I miss you, Mom.
JACKIE MOON => Oh. I am? That's bad isn't it?
JACKIE MOON => Hey Mom, I threw up.
MONIX => And I don't care how quick their defense is, we need to move the ball and--
JACKIE MOON => --Hold on you guys. I have something to tell you.
MONIX => What is it? Jackie seems very serious...
JACKIE MOON => I had a dream. I had a dream, I was in heaven and my Mother spoke to me... She was wearing a flowing white gown... And she showed me a whole new way to score a basket. She spoke to me and said with this gift, you will win fourth place.'
TWIGGY MUNSON => We need to figure out what we're going to do in the second half.
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => Yeah, we don't have time for any ghost baskets.
MONIX => Alright Jackie, relax, okay?
OTHERWORLD! => Monix and Clarence shoot each other a look. Clearly, Jackie is not going to take no for an answer.
CLARENCE => Okay Jackie, so what's the play?
JACKIE => I had a dream. And in my dream, my mother jumped... Her gown flowing in the wind... And she caught a pass in the air and dunked it, without ever touching the ground... SLO MO: Clarence catches it and slams it hard.
JACKIE MOON => .She lifted her veil and said 'I call this the Alley Oop.' Everyone stands there, astonished. The other team is frozen. The fans are confused. The ref has no idea what to do.
JACKIE MOON => .And she said it would change the game forever... The other players are starting to appreciate what they've just seen.
SPUR #1 => Damn, bro.
SPUR #2 => Doesn't he have to dribble first?
LOU REDWOOD => What the Hell is going on?
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => Hey Jackie, isn't that against the rules?
JACKIE MOON => No. My Mom said it was fine. The whole arena is waiting for Father Pat the Ref to process this information.
IT'S TRAVELING! => WHISTLE! Father Pat The ref waves his hands.
MONIX => It's not a foul unless you touch another player. And it can't be traveling without first establishing a pivot foot. It's two points, Father Pat, two points. Father Pat the Ref thinks about this...
FOR FLINT! => The crowd goes nuts. The other team protests. Jackie points to the sky, right through the hole in the roof.
MONIX =>  Okay, listen up: They've made adjustments out there. We can't just keep running the Alley Oop, okay? They're keying on Clarence. Everyone looks at each other, worried.
SCOOTSIE DOUBLE-DAY => We're not going to run the alley oop?
MONIX => We're going to run The Puke.
MONIX => Don't tell me you've forgotten it. Everyone smiles at each other. They haven't.
MONIX => We're going to pick away from the ball. We're going to move to the open space. I won't in bound the ball until someone has a good look. . The Puke.
CLARENCE => Amen.
JACKIE MOON => Bring it in! One two three--
JACKIE MOON =>  Don't worry you guys, I got this...  I am awesome at free throws.
JACKIE MOON => 
THING. => Now Jackie sets up for the shot...
MONIX => What the Hell are you doing?
JACKIE MOON => What, you've never seen me shoot free throws before?
CLARENCE => He shoots them Granny style.
MONIX =>  Shit. Jackie's ritual is insane. He breathes, spins the ball, turns around 360, deep knee bends, touches his left shoulder four times, then SUDDENLY WINGS THE BALL HIGH IN THE AIR.
MEGA BOWL! => Victory. All the Tropics go crazy, screaming, they pile on top of each other at center court. The crowd is going nuts. Wheelchair Darren and Jody roll out onto the court. Dukes jumps into the pile of players. Lynn has tears in her eyes. In the madness. LUCY MOON finds her husband, Jackie.
LUCY MOON => Jackie!
JACKIE MOON => Lucy?
LUCY MOON => Kiss me, you hero.
JACKIE MOON => My Mom says you're a bad lady. She says your vagina is for sad people.
CLARENCE => Wait, there really is a trophy?
JACKIE MOON => Hey, it's the Mega Bowl.
CLARENCE => We did it.
ANNOUNCER => With their first pick in the 1977 NBA draft, the New Jersey Nets select...
DRAFT ANNOUNCER => .Shit, bitch, you be fine... Clarence stands up, happy, and walks on stage. He holds up a uniform with words: SHITBITCH U.B. PHYNE on it. REVEAL: In the crowd, Monix claps, cheering Clarence on... He is with wife, LYNN. But now Monix stands up and walks on stage too. He puts a NEW YORK NETS hat on.
DRAFT ANNOUNCER => Here to welcome him is rookie Nets coach, Ed Monix. Monix and Clarence shake hands for the cameras.
CLARENCE => Thanks for bringing me on board, coach.
MONIX => All the good players were gone.
CLARENCE => Do we really have to live in New Jersey?
MONIX => Just smile for the cameras, Shitbitch.
ORIGINAL SONG. => We recognize Jackie's song as the most familiar song in the world. It's Gary Glitter's 'Rock N' Roll Part II' the most famous sports-stadium standard in history.
JACKIE MOON => 
HEY! => 
JACKIE MOON => 
HEY! => 
HEY! => 
HEY! => The song ends. The recording engineer pipes in.
RECORDING ENGINEER => Sounded pretty nice.
JACKIE MOON => Yeah, that was a great take. Play that back for me, would you?
RECORDING ENGINEER => Listen, can you take that ring off for a little while? I'm getting some feedback from your microphone.
JACKIE MOON => Sorry Robert, the ring stays on.
