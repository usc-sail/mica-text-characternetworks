CUT TO => In the background we hear Jay Leno s monologue from the Tonight Show. A small lamp and the glow from a computer screen illuminates SEBASTIAN CAINE, late twenties with the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student. Wiry framed and wearing only boxer shorts, Sebastian sips coffee from an  Einstein  coffee mug. He peers at a complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his screen. He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts slightly, then falls apart. Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the cellophane and sucks it down. He attacks the keyboard with renewed vigor. Another molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian s fingers fly across the keyboard. The molecule blinks on and off, it trembles and twists apart. SEBASTIAN Damnit. Sebastian pears out his window. Across the courtyard, a light comes on in a neighboring window. He sees a BRUNETTE, mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her living room. The Brunette thumbs through the mail, tosses it and then begins to undress. Sebastian loans over to the window, getting interested. But when the brunette reaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window and lowers her shades. SEBASTIAN Damnit. Sebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes. He s obviously tired. He opens his eyes and stares up at the ceiling. Painted across the white matte finish in big red letters is a brief reminder -  You Should Be Working.  Sebastian sighs, leans forward and begins pecking away again.
LATER => The television is now only static. We pan by his alarm clock. 4 am. We find Sebastian pacing in front of his computer. He gets an idea... slides back in his chair. Types away again. The molecule reforms on the computer screen. He types a few more keys, waits, watches the molecule. Nothing happens. He hits a few more keys and watches intently for a reaction. SEBASTIAN  I am a goddamn genius. He hits a few more keys and a telephone keypad appears on the screen. He dials.
CUT TO => Digital phone rings. In the bed, LINDA FOSTER, late twenties, stirs from a deep sleep. As she straggles out of bed and over to her desk, we notice a young man sleeping next to her. The ringing continues. She moves her computer mouse around and her screen comes to life. She click on a telephone icon and the ringing stops. A beat later, Sebastian appears in a window on her screen. LINDA Sebastian, do you know what time it is? SEBASTIAN You know Da Vinci never slept. Said it was waste of time. LINDA What is it this time? INTERCUT: SEBASTIAN S BEDROOM Sebastian peers at the image of Linda in the computer window. He notices something behind her in the bed, the young man sleeping face down. SEBASTIAN Who s that? Linda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer screen and positions it so Sebastian can t see the bed. LINDA Not your business. Not anymore. SEBASTIAN Touche. LINDA So you calling about anything in particular, or were you just hoping to catch me sleeping in the nude? SEBASTIAN I cracked the reversion. Upon hearing this, Linda receives a jolt of adrenaline. LINDA You cracked it? SEBASTIAN Look at this. Sebastian hits a couple of keys. A moment later the molecular structure appears on Linda s computer. SEBASTIAN Watch this. LINDA You sure? SEBASTIAN 91% sure. LINDA  Eleven months with no progress and you suddenly come up with it out of the blue? How? SEBASTIAN The usual. Coffee and twinkies. LINDA I hate you. SEBASTIAN I know. You think you could hunt down Matt and get to the lab early. I want Isabelle prepped for a live test. LINDA Yeah, I think I can find him. What are you going to do? SEBASTIAN Well y know. It s daylight in Switzerland. I gotta call the Nobel Committee and tell them to get our prizes ready. See you in a few. ON LINDA S COMPUTER SCREEN as Sebastian clicks off. Linda crosses to her bed, and shakes the guy awake. LINDA Hey... come on. DR. MATTHEW KENSINGTON, late 20s too, stirs from under sheets. MATT  What? LINDA Sebastian just called. We gotta get to the lab. Matt bolts up. MATT Shit! You didn t tell him I was here, did you? LINDA Give me some credit, will ya. MATT So what s the rush? LINDA He cracked reversion. Matt pulls his jeans on. MATT Wanna ride down? LINDA We better take our own cars. MATT You re gonna have to tell him about us eventually. LINDA I know. It s just You re his best friend. He ll feel betrayed. From a distance, the Nation s Monuments stand awash in the harsh light of morning. CAMERA finds a BLACK PORSCHE as it pulls to the security fence of a warehouse. The imposing structure is surrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed wire. The Porsche is waved through security and heads straight into the warehouse. The Porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space and Sebastian exits, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and Birkenstocks. He notes the other cars parked in the lot, then crosses to bunker in the center of the warehouse, guarded by a MARINE, shouldering an M-16. MARINE GUARD Morning, sir. SEBASTIAN Morning, Ed. MARINE GUARD Your team s in early. Something special going on? SEBASTIAN Sorry, Ed. You know the rules. Sebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen. A laser reads his print. Scan readout: CAINE, SEBASTIAN Clearance:    ALPHA ALPHA THREE Division:    CLASSIFIED The doors whisk open and Sebastian steps inside. MARINE GUARD Have a good day, sir. Inside the elevator is a numberless keypad. Sebastian taps in his floor code. ELEVATOR Authorization please. SEBASTIAN Caine zero zero two seven. ELEVATOR Authorization verified. Good morning, Dr. Caine. The elevator descends with a groaning hum. It passes below us and keeps descending into the belly of the earth, the shaft goes down forever. We slowly push down a hallway panelled by Plexiglas chambers. Each chamber looks as if it s tailored for a specific animal, although no animals are visible. As we pass one habitat, something slams into the Plexiglas and begins barking. Another HOWL joins in. Then SCREECHING. Suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen animal cries. THUMP. THUMP. The Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry animals were slamming against it. But still, no animals are seen. Above each chamber, VIDEO SCREENS display THERMAL IMAGES revealing heat signatures of the various animals, but they remain invisible to the naked eye. MATT taps on a sheet of Plexiglas which seals off another seemingly empty cage. MATT Isabelle ... The woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the Plexiglas steams up right in front of Matt s face. The Plexiglas begins to shake violently. MATT Calm down baby. Calm down. It s okay... Matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and pulls them down over his eyes. THERMAL POV - A rather large heat signature, ape-like in shape, rattles about the cage. Matt slowly unlatches the Plexiglas door and reaches inside. MATT It s okay, baby. It s okay. I m not going to hurt you. Come here. THERMAL POV - he reaches out to the creature. He grabs hold of it, firmly. Stroking it. The creature COOS. Matt reaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature. MATT Just hold still. Something clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin. Blood erupts in a bite pattern. MATT Ow, shit. Matt drops the hypo and falls back. The cage door flies open and something runs out. Matt pulls himself up to see the heat signature running down the hallway. He turns around to see another heat signature coming at him. Matt pulls off his goggles to see Linda coming up the Corridor. LINDA You okay? MATT She bit me. LINDA Yeah. She s become a lot more aggressive in the last few days. Linda takes the goggles from Matt. LINDA Go take care of that bite. I ll get her. MATT And give you a chance to pull ahead? Never. Linda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and pulls out a two tranquilizer guns. She hands one to Matt. AROUND THE CORNER A slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us. We hear HOOTS and FOOTSTEPS. Looking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a haunting heavy breathing. The control door is closed though and something large and angry is throwing itself against it. We can t see anything. A few moments later, Linda and Matt round the corner, wearing goggles and leveling their pistols. MATT  Shh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. I m hunting simians.   heheheheh. LINDA Knock it off.  Isabelle! THERMAL POV - Dark hallway. Movement. A red shimmering heat signature. It comes running at Linda. HOWLING. Linda fires. A T-DART flies. Thwack... It stops in mid-air. Then falls. But it doesn t hit the floor. Instead, it stops inches above the ground. THERMAL POV - the heat signature lies in a heap at Linda s feet. MATT Good shootin , Tex. LINDA What s that make it? MATT I m still ahead. 6 to 5. Like a smug gunfighter, Linda blows imaginary smoke from the top of her tranquilizer gun. LINDA But I m catching up. The elevator doors open and Sebastian steps out. He s met by SARAH KENNEDY, early thirties, a fiery red-head. SARAH Can I have a word? SEBASTIAN Most normal people say good morning. SARAH Don t you think you should test the protocol on the liver samples before you inject Isabelle? SEBASTIAN How many tissue samples have we successfully regressed? Hundreds, right? How many have gone on to work on the full system? None. SARAH That s beside the point. SEBASTIAN No, that is the point. I m not going to waste six months of my life on an outmoded testing procedure. This thing works. I know it. I feel it. Linda comes down the corridor, listening in on the tail end of the conversation. SARAH Fine. You can mop up afterward. SEBASTIAN You think I m going to kill Isabelle? SARAH Kill? More like liquefy. SEBASTIAN Sarah, thank you for your opinion, but I m the project leader. Understand? She says ... SARAH Yes, Sir. ... but somehow it feels like  Fuck you.  She storms off. Sebastian turns to Linda. SEBASTIAN How did you ever convince me to hire her? LINDA You said you wanted the beat vet in the country. SEBASTIAN Yeah, well she cares more about the animals than the research. LINDA Maybe that s why she s so good.
CUT TO => CLOSE ON: MATT as he shuts off the spinning cyclotron. As it s spinning slows to a halt, he pops the top and reaches in, removing... A GLOWING VIAL OF ORANGE LIQUID. Sebastian peers at the vial. SEBASTIAN Who da Man? You da Man. MATT As we pull out we see we are. Almost feels like a dungeon. Think high-tech Frankenstein. Walls lined with video displays, technical readouts, bizarre medical equipment. On a table in the middle of the room, a sheet drapes over a humanoid form, strapped down at it s invisible limbs. The straps move slightly... ghostly. Wires lead from the body to lots of machinery. MATT Protocol is hot. SEBASTIAN Vitals? Sarah, checks over the various readouts ... heartbeat, blood pressure, the rest. SARAH Normal. CARTER ABBEY, the late thirties lab assistant, wheels in a cart of equipment. Linda taken a seat by the table and pushes aside the sheet. BOOMING VOICE THIS IS GOD. YOU ARE DISTURBING THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND WILL BE SEVERELY PUNISHED FOR ALL ETERNITY. GOD HAS SPOKEN. SEBASTIAN How many times do I have to tell you, Frank you aren t God.  I am. FRANK Sorry, Boss. Forgot. Sebastian glance up at a glass booth overlooking the Laboratory floor. TWO PEOPLE in the booth. SEBASTIAN You guys ready to roll? FRANK CHASE, early thirties, and tech expert JANICE WALTON, early twenties, man a small booth above the lab. They re dressed more like band roadies than scientists. The room is crammed with electronic and recording equipment. A handful of monitors display different images of the lab. Thermal and regular video. Another screen monitors vital signs. FRANK We are live and in color. On your mark. Frank and Janice looks down on their colleagues. Sebastian nods their way. SEBASTIAN Okay. Roll  em. JANICE Okay. We are rolling record on videos one through twelve. Frank hits a series of buttons and speaks into a microphone. Recording. Frank s voice echoes through the chamber. FRANK Subject Isabelle Two. Currently in phase shift... one hundred twenty six days, eighteen hours. LINDA Testing De-Phase protocol. Injecting serial protein Caine One Two Five. Linda removes a glowing vial of orange liquid from a centrifuge nearby. MATT Maybe if you stopped naming them after yourself, you d have better luck. SEBASTIAN Why thank you, Dr. Kensington, for that keen scientific observation. I ll be sure to include it in my memoirs. MATT A whole mention? And I thought I was just gonna be a footnote. Matt unwraps a hypodermic needle and jabs the needle into the vial, drawing up the colored liquid. MATT Okay. Frank and Janice monitor Isabelle s vitals. Tension in the air. SEBASTIAN  Ready. She wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it tight. She then takes some dye and sprays it. A surface appears, floating beneath the restraints. It sheens in the light as Linda searches for a vein. She slaps the surface several times. A small bulge appears, like a vein. LINDA Propped. MATT Let s make some history. Matt lowers the hypo to the vein. But Sebastian takes the hypo from Matt s hand. SEBASTIAN Nice try, Sparky. Matt relinquishes the needle. LINDA Come on, Isabelle. You can do this. Sebastian lowers the hypo. The skin bonds and gives. The needle remains in sight after it slips through the visible surface. Matt presses down on the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream. The gold liquid twists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb. It s the shape of a vein. The liquid begins to react. Small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of color. Ba-bump.. ba-bump... the heartbeat starts to speed up. SARAH Elevated heartbeat. Janice analyzes the screens. JANICE We re still in the green. FRANK Confirmed. Vitals still in the normal range. The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex webbing of a bloodstream appears. MATT It s reacting. Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes visible.. the shadow of a skeletal system. SEBASTIAN Do you see this? LINDA It s working. It s actually working. Matt pulls the sheet back. Muscles are beginning to appear. And eyeballs. Frightened eyeballs. SARAH Heart rate s up. She s scared. Sarah soothes her. SARAH It's okay, baby. It's okay. SEBASTIAN Subject began manifesting almost Immediately. Protocol is reacting quickly. Isabelle starts to struggle against her restraints. She begins to howl. LINDA Subject may be in pain or extreme discomfort. SARAH Goddamnit. Blood pressure elevating. Brain activity going through the roof. The brain appears, seemingly growing from the inside out. The shape of a large half-formed monkey grows from the inside out. A SKULL APPEARS howling in pain, in horror. SARAH We ve got a problem. SEBASTIAN What? What problem! Sarah checks her monitors. SARAH It s her heart. We can see the heart beating in the ape s FRANK I got an erratic heart beat. SARAH She s going into cardiac arrest. LINDA Got the crash cart. Carter charges the crash cart and rolls it in. SARAH We re losing her. Her machine flatlines. SEBASTIAN No! It s got to work. The body is only half there. It looks as if its caught in decomposition. Linda rubs the cardiac paddles together. LINDA Clear! Linda slams the paddles on the monkey s chest. The jolt of electricity makes the monkey visible again for a brief moment. Then the skin and flesh fade away again. SARAH We ve got something! The heartbeat starts up again. The body continues its march toward,visibility. SARAH Still. erratic. LINDA Come on Isabelle. Come on. You can do it. You can fucking do it. Everybody s pulling for her. SARAH Come on, monkey. MATT Do it. Do it. Come on. Muscles spread like a rash on bone as the monkey twists and turns, frightened. Then skin. The monkey howls. Skin forms over the muscles reappearing like it was being painted on before our eyes. SARAH Stabilizing. The entire form glows, then blinks, then glows again, as if it was discharging some stored energy. FRANK Brain activity returning to normal. The monkey grunts and groans. Blinks its eyes. Linda hovers over it stroking its fur. LINDA Welcome back, Isabelle. Sebastian puts his hand on Linda s shoulder... a move that does not go unnoticed by Matt. We did it. SEBASTIAN  How is she? SARAH  I think she s gonna be okay
CARTER => Amazing. She's normal, absolutely healthy. If you didn't know any better, you'd think nothing had happened to her.
MATT =>  Yeah. I can't wait to slice up her brain and trace her neural pathways.
SARAH => Screw you, Matt.
MATT => Well maybe not right away.
LINDA => We should celebrate.
SEBASTIAN => To the finest research team I've ever known.
SEBASTIAN => Hey...
LINDA => I thought you'd gone.
SEBASTIAN => Where would I go?
SEBASTIAN => Twenty years ago there were no computers, no fax machines, no cell phones. I was just wondering what the world will be like twenty years from now... if what we're doing will change everything.
LINDA => A little "I am become death... the shatterer of worlds"?
SEBASTIAN => Something like that.
LINDA => Since the day I met, all you wanted to do was change the world.
LINDA => Listen, I know we've... I mean... well ... I just want you to know how proud I am of you. I know it probably doesn't mean a lot...
SEBASTIAN => Actually it does.  I guess since you were there from the beginning, you know me better than anyone else on this godforsaken planet.
LINDA => You're positively maudlin. You should be happy. Do you have any idea what you've accomplished?
SEBASTIAN => Yeah... but I was working so hard, I didn't realize I'd have no one to share it with.
SEBASTIAN => I don't suppose we could turn back the clock for a night and you could come home with me?
SEBASTIAN => Right. Sorry. Too much champagne.
MATT => What was that about?
LINDA => Nothing. It's just... He is who he is. Sometimes I just have to be reminded.
SEBASTIAN =>  What's it like? Talk goddamnit! Tell me what it's like!
SEBASTIAN => Six years ago, this committee commissioned me with a very specific task...
SEBASTIAN => To successful phase-shift a human being out of quantum sync with the visible universe and then return him safely, with no after affects.
SEBASTIAN => Well, we found out sending them to "never-never-land" was easy, it's the getting back that's hard.
SEBASTIAN => Every time we've tried to bring a test subject back from phase-shift. Cellular bonds would dissolve, the primary DNA strands would decay. But now...
SEBASTIAN => But now...
KRAMER => But now?
SEBASTIAN => But now...  But now, we feel we are closer than ever to resolving this issue. We've been experimenting with a new regression formula that looks rather promising. A FOUR STAR GENERAL leans forward.
GENERAL => How long?
SEBASTIAN => Sir?
GENERAL => Son, as you can imagine, we are very anxious to field test this tactical asset. How long till you resolve this issue?
SEBASTIAN => Shouldn't be more than another year, Sir.
SEBASTIAN => Maybe sooner.
MATT => Yo. Reality check! What the hell was that about?
SEBASTIAN => Keep your voice down.
MATT => The protocol works. Why'd you tell them it didn't?
SEBASTIAN => I wasn't ready for them to know.
MATT => But they're the oversight committee. They're supposed to know.
LINDA => I'm sure he had a reason.  You did have a reason, didn't you, Sebastian?
SEBASTIAN => I had more than a reason. I had a goddamn epiphany.
SEBASTIAN => What do you think they'd do if they know we could send a subject into phase shift and pull it back out again? How many seconds would it take for them to take over the whole project, bringing in their soldiers to test the formula on. We'd have lost control of it by the end of the week.
LINDA => It's their money, Sebastian. It's going to happen eventually.
SEBASTIAN => I know. But not yet. There's too much for us to learn. I don't want my hands tied by their political agenda when we go to phase three.
MATT => Well, then... mind telling us how you're gonna get a human test-subject for phase three without the committee finding out?
SEBASTIAN => That's easy. I've decided to test the procedure ...
SEBASTIAN => ... on myself.
FRANK => Are you nuts?
SEBASTIAN => Was Jonas Salk nuts?
FRANK => Yeah. Pretty sure he was.
CARTER => And remember, for every Jonas Salk, there are a bunch of guys who aren't famous cuz they died.
SEBASTIAN => If we're that unsure, how can we morally justify testing it on someone else?
JANICE => Isn't it a little soon to be moving into phase three anyway?
SARAH => She's right. We haven't even finished collating the phase two research.
SEBASTIAN => We'll have plenty of time to collate and cross-reference later. Monkey data doesn't matter anyway. The only real data is human data.
SARAH => You don't even know if any of the protocols will work on humans.
SEBASTIAN => How are we gonna find out? Besides, we've succeeded with a gorilla and their DNA is 98% the same as humans. And the 2% is not that significant.
LINDA => Sebastian ... humans can talk, build houses and cook in microwave ovens. Gorilla's live in trees. That's a helluva 2% if you ask me.
SEBASTIAN => We're all concerned. I know that. But if we're gonna move forward ever, this is something we have to do.
LINDA => Why you? Why not one of us?
SEBASTIAN => The risks. I couldn't ask...
MATT =>  What if we volunteer?
LINDA => What if you're too valuable to lose?
SEBASTIAN => I'm Project Leader. It's my formula and my call. The best way to express your concern is to make damn sure you do your best work. I'll want about four weeks to...
FRANK => To put your affairs in order?
SEBASTIAN => To run some more reversions and tissue tests and then we'll attempt the phase shift. I'll stay shifted for three days of testing and then we'll perform a quantum regression.
SEBASTIAN => Come in.
SEBASTIAN => What?
LINDA => In the past six years, I've never once challenged your decisions, but this ... Sebastian. I don't think you should do this.
SEBASTIAN => You don't understand.
LINDA => Oh please. How long were we together? You must've said it a million times ... Nobody knows who built the lunar lander. All they remember in the first man on the moon.
LINDA => But what if something happens to you... what about the project?
SEBASTIAN => Lin, trust me... nothing's going to happen.
LINDA => He refuses to listen to reason.
MATT => Can we talk about this later? I'm trying to make love to you.
LINDA => Sorry. I just can't let it go.
MATT => I know how you're feeling. Hell, he and I've been friends since freshman year.
LINDA => So how can we let him do this?
MATT => What if you were given the opportunity to be the first person on ,Mars, would you go?
LINDA => In a heartbeat.
MATT => What if they didn't know whether or not they could get you home?
MATT => This is his chance to be Chuck Yeager or Christopher Columbus. Well, if I were him I'd do the same thing.
LINDA => Let me ask another question.
MATT => Is about who gets to be on top?
LINDA => Is the human race really ready for what we're doing?
MATT => Why do you always get philosophical before we're about to get physical?
LINDA => No really. Is it ready? We're barrelling down a road that begs moral and ethical questions that I don't think we can answer.
MATT => They said the same thing about the bomb. They said we'd never survive the nuclear age... but here we are.
LINDA => This night is still young.  I mean, when you think about it, it's creepy. Do we really want to live in a world where people can just disappear in the blink of an eye?
MATT => We made our deal with the devil years ago. Might as well stick around to cash in.
SEBASTIAN =>  Yes?
MATT => We're ready.
SEBASTIAN => Okay.
MATT => It's not too late to back out. I'm happy to take your place.
SEBASTIAN => No. I'm ready.
MATT => Nervous?
SEBASTIAN => A little.
MATT => Ever tell you the one about Superman and Wonder Woman?
SEBASTIAN => I don't think so.
MATT => So Superman's flying around the city, and he's horny as hell.  Lo and behold he looks down and sees Wonder Woman, completely nude, sunning herself up on the roof of the Justice League. I mean she is lying there naked and spread eagle. So Superman starts thinking, "man... this is too easy. I could go down there, do a little fast pumping and be gone before she even sees me." After all he is faster than a speeding bullet, right? Anyway, he swoops down, takes care of business so quick, you can't even see him. Well ... I tell ya. Wonder Woman looks up, surprised as hell and says "What the hell was that." And the Invisible Man replies "I dunno know, but it sure hurt like hell."
SEBASTIAN => You know, that could be the last joke I ever hear.
MATT => C'mon, man. That's funny shit.
LINDA => O.K. How're you feeling?
SEBASTIAN => Fine.
SARAH => Pulse 88, BP 140 over 95. A bit elevated.
SEBASTIAN => To be expected.
SARAH => No reason for concern. He's ready.
SEBASTIAN => Hey... it's gonna be okay.
LINDA => Start recording.
JANICE => We're hot. All systems nominal, Houston.
FRANK => Okay, kids. Let's make some history.
LINDA => Subject: Male, Age 29, weight 166 lbs.
MATT =>  Ready.
MATT => If the tests are any indication it should work quickly.
SEBASTIAN => I'll inject myself. If anything goes wrong, they can't blame you.
LINDA => We can still shut down, Sebastian.
MATT => Any last words?
SEBASTIAN => Yeah. If I'm killed, pretend I said something deep and clever.
LINDA => Injection was administered at  ... 18:23:47.
LINDA => Keep talking. Tell us what you're feeling.
SEBASTIAN => Nothing so far.
SARAH => Vitals are stable.
LINDA => Nothing's happening.
MATT => Human DNA structure is slightly more complex... it's possible that it may take more time...
LINDA => Maybe we overlooked something.
SEBASTIAN => Recheck the protocol. It can't be non- reactive.
CARTER => Kinda like a firecracker with a bad fuse...
CARTER => Don't know if it'll go off.
LINDA => Frank?
FRANK =>  No change in bio-electric.
SEBASTIAN => Goddammit.
SEBASTIAN => Okay wait, my arm... it's getting a bit warm... yeah, it's ... it's starting to tingle...
SEBASTIAN => Okay... it's spreading to my back... like, like a fever...
LINDA => Here we go.
SEBASTIAN => Shit... it's starting to burn... Oh god. It hurts. I didn't think it would hurt.
SARAH => Heartbeat's elevated. Pulse at 100. ... 130 ...
LINDA => What do you feel? Keep talking. KEEP TALKING!
SEBASTIAN => Pain!
SARAH => Pulse is 165 ... 170 Blood pressure 180 over 100. ...
CARTER => He's going to blow out his heart.
LINDA => Prop the crash cart.
MATT => We've got to stop it!
LINDA => We can't!
JANICE => Something's happening.
FRANK => Listen up! Electric activity increasing in all limbs. Brainwaves are through the roof.
JANICE => I didn't think the human brain could spike that high.
FRANK => Maybe it can't.
SEBASTIAN => No. Oh god! NO! STOP IT! STOP IT!
SARAH => Pulse is 180 .... holding stable.
CARTER => Holy shit.
SARAH => Pulse is dropping. 170.. 150 .... 160..
LINDA => Bio-quantum phase shift occurred at 18:26.
MATT => Is he dead?
LINDA => No. He passed out from the trauma.
SARAH => Vitals returning to normal. Pulse 110 ... dropping. Blood pressure 130 over
FRANK => Electrical activity is stabilizing.
SARAH => Pulse steady at 70.
MATT => Un-fucking-believable.
LINDA =>  You did it, Sebastian. You're the first.
CARTER => Let's get him into recovery.
MATT => S'okay. You nodded off.
LINDA => His breathing's hypnotic. How long's it been?
MATT => Seventeen hours.
LINDA => Where are the others?
MATT => In the lab crunching numbers. We've got enough data there for two lifetimes of research.
LINDA => I keep looking at that hole, wondering if he's really there.
LINDA => Did you see...
MATT => He may be coming out of it.
SEBASTIAN => The lights! Turn off the goddamn lights! Ah Christ!
SEBASTIAN => I can't... I can't close my eyes. I can't close my eyes.
LINDA => Your eyelids are transparent.
SEBASTIAN => So I ... I'm...
LINDA => Yes.
SEBASTIAN => My arms. I can.. where? ... I can feel them...
LINDA => Your arms ... your whole body... It worked, Sebastian. It worked.
SEBASTIAN => Mirror. I ... I want to see.
MATT => Over here in the corner.
MATT => What was it like?
SEBASTIAN => I ... It's hard to think.
SEBASTIAN => The transformation... I remember every molecule in my body shattering.
MATT => It was painful?
SEBASTIAN => At first... but then everything went black. I couldn't see or hear or feel anything. It was all just black... like I wasn't connected.
LINDA => Your system received quite a shock.
SEBASTIAN => At least my senses are starting to return... You're wearing your Shalimar, aren't you?
LINDA => Sebastian.
SEBASTIAN => This is weird. I'm looking through myself at the floor. I'm looking right through myself. I can't tell ...
SEBASTIAN => ... where my body is.
LINDA => Sebastian?
MATT => Sebastian?
SEBASTIAN => You really can't see me. Can you?
LINDA => Gimme symptoms. Dizziness, nausea, headache, body-ache, disorientation.
SEBASTIAN => No, just tired.  It's funny. I can see everything... more than before... but I can't see myself.
CARTER => Hey. How's he doing?
LINDA => Why don't you ask him?
SARAH => Sebastian, how do you feel.
SEBASTIAN => Not to bad, considering.
SEBASTIAN => Odd, isn't it?
LINDA => He can't close his eyes so they're sensitive to light.
JANICE => So, what was it like?
SEBASTIAN => Over here.
LINDA => C'mon Sebastian. Knock it off.
SEBASTIAN => Sorry. Couldn't resist.
FRANK => I feel like we're playing Marco Polo.
MATT => Well, I see the procedure hasn't changed your personality.
FRANK => No worries. I'm on it.
FRANK => Gotcha, big man.
SEBASTIAN => Boy, you people have no sense of humor.
SEBASTIAN => Show me. So ...
SEBASTIAN => Stop there.
SEBASTIAN => Index that. That was when it started burn. Epidermal reaction.
JANICE => Index Mark. 112125.
LINDA => It's late. Time you got some rest.
SEBASTIAN => Just a little longer.
LINDA => Hate to pull rank, but you're my patient now and you need rest. We've got a busy day tomorrow.
SEBASTIAN => Fine.
LINDA => We've set up a thermal camera for observation and I've arranged one of us to be here 24/7 in case you need anything. The team's gonna be on alpha- call alert for the duration. If anything goes wrong, we can all be here within...
SEBASTIAN => Thirty minutes. Yes,,_I know. I wrote the procedure.
LINDA => I was trying to be reassuring.
SEBASTIAN => You like this don't you?
LINDA => What's that?
SEBASTIAN => Being in charge.
LINDA => Please. I'm just doing my job.
LINDA => You gonna be okay?
SARAH => Fine. It's not like I have anything else going on in my sad pathetic life.
LINDA => Carter'll be in at six to spell you and I'll be in by nine. Call me if anything happens, okay?
SARAH => I'm fine. Go on ahead.
CARTER => Man, I'm tired. That was a long day.
LINDA => Days only get longer from here.
SEBASTIAN =>  Sarah. Are you awake?
SEBASTIAN =>  Hmm.
SARAH => Dr. Caine! Goddamnit, Dr. Caine! Are you in here?
SARAH => Dr. Caine?
SARAH => Dr. Caine, please report in.
SARAH => Dr. Caine, report in please!
SARAH => Shit.
SARAH => Dr. Caine? Sebastian? Come on, this isn't funny. I know you're in here.
SARAH => I must be going crazy.
SARAH => I found him later in the lab, running samples.
LINDA => Why didn't you call me?
SARAH => Because I wasn't sure. I'm still not. I mean, I could've easily been dreaming.
MATT => It doesn't sound like something Sebastian would do.
SARAH => God, I feel so stupid.
LINDA => I can talk to him.
SARAH => No. I mean...  It was probably nothing. I shouldn't've mentioned it.
MATT => You sure?
SARAH => Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, y'know, why would he do that, right? Just, this place at night can be kinda creepy, y'know.
MATT => So, how was your first night?
SEBASTIAN => Restless. Hard to sleep when you can't close your eyes.
MATT => Yeah? What'd you do?
SEBASTIAN => Got up a couple of times. Knocked about.
MATT => Yeah, Sarah mentioned you weren't in your cubicle. She said she called you over the intercom and you didn't respond.
SEBASTIAN => I guess I didn't hear. I had the radio on.
MATT => It'd be helpful to us if you'd tell whoever's on duty where you're going to. I mean, if something were to happen, we'd want to know where to find you.
SEBASTIAN => I didn't think it was a problem.
MATT => It isn't. I just don't want it to become one.
MATT => Readings are normal.
SEBASTIAN => Next I want to run a VV and UVF analysis of the platelets.
MATT => We'll have to draw some more blood.
SEBASTIAN => You okay?
SARAH => Yeah. Why?
SEBASTIAN => You just seem a little nervous.
SARAH => No. I...I'm fine. Hold still. This might hurt a bit.
SARAH => Dr. Caine... this might sounds stupid, but are you... are you looking at me.
SEBASTIAN => No. I was looking at the clock. Why?
SARAH => Just felt like someone was staring at me.
LINDA => Sebastian? Goddamnit.
SEBASTIAN => You've no idea how much fun I've had. I'm going to hate going back.
LINDA => That's what worries me.?
SEBASTIAN => How so?
LINDA => What happens when we turn the project over to the Army. Ever wonder how much fun they're gonna have?
SEBASTIAN => Maybe we won't give it to them. His voice comes from behind her now.
SEBASTIAN => I was thinking... tonight's my last night. Ever fantasize about making love to an invisible man?
LINDA => Stop it, Sebastian. It's not funny.
SEBASTIAN => Well, don't do it for me. Do it for science.
LINDA => Grow up.
SEBASTIAN => Oh well. Missed your big chance.
LINDA => Got some sleep. Big day tomorrow.
LINDA => Recording?
FRANK => Recording. Subject Doctor Sebastian Caine. Currently in phase shift... Three days, seven hours.
LINDA => De-Phase protocol. Injecting Serial Protein Caine One Two Seven.
LINDA => Ready?
SEBASTIAN => Not really. I was just starting to enjoy myself.
LINDA => Tough.
MATT => Okay, man. Here we go.
SEBASTIAN => Wait... something... something doesn't feel right.
SARAH => Heartbeat elevated.
FRANK => Vitals still nominal..
SEBASTIAN => I can't br... br...
LINDA => What's wrong?
SARAH => He's not breathing.
MATT => Subject manifesting.
SARAH => Pulse erratic.
LINDA => Carter!
LINDA => Sebastian! Sebastian!
LINDA => Sebastian!
MATT => Get a tranq. Stat.
LINDA => He's reverting. Got him on the table.
LINDA => Get me a I.V. of A.G. seven.
SARAH => I got no pulse. No pulse.
MATT => Start CPR.
CARTER => Getting a pulse.
MATT => Holy shit. What happened?
LINDA => Sebastian... can you hear me? Can you hear me? How are his pupils?
MATT => I can't see his goddamn pupils!
SARAH => I think he's going into shock.
FADE => UP ON:
MATT => Just got the tissue sample results. Cellular cohesion is stable.
MATT => How bout you? You gonna be okay?
LINDA => Guess so.  I was just thinking about the Apollo missions. Y'know? Grissom, White and Chaffee... What it was like for them on that launch pad that day, thinking they were gonna reach the stars only to burn to death.
MATT => Sometimes the test pilots make history. Sometimes the planes crash and people die.
LINDA => But he didn't die, did he?  What if we can't bring him back? What then?
MATT => It's just a little hitch is all. He'll be the first to tell that he'll crack it and I'm sure he will. It'll just take time.  Listen, let's got out of here. We could drive up to the old observatory. We'll take some wine and go count the stars and forget all this for awhile.
LINDA => No. I want to be here for him.
SEBASTIAN =>  Hey...
LINDA => Hey...
SEBASTIAN => So I guess it didn't work.
SEBASTIAN => You look worried. It must've been bad.
LINDA => You almost died.
SEBASTIAN => Well, remember your Nietchze. Whatever doesn't kill me, makes me stronger.
LINDA => I should be making you feel better. Not vice versa.
SEBASTIAN => I guess if I'm going to be stuck this way for awhile, I'd better make some adjustments.
MATT => Not too bad.
SEBASTIAN => The latex'll limit the amount of light delivered to my optic nerves.
LINDA => You could almost pass for human.
SEBASTIAN => Well, it gives you a face to talk to at least, and we can all work in normal light again.
SEBASTIAN => The testing's making me sick.
LINDA => Could be the barium or the radiation.
MATT => You're physiology has changed and, well, all bets are off.
SEBASTIAN => I can't believe I have to spend another night here.  Suppose you're gonna go home now, meet up with that boyfriend of yours now.
LINDA => Do you want me to stay?
SEBASTIAN => No. That's okay. It's just, being a guinea pig is more work than I thought. I'll be fine.
CARTER =>  Dr. Caine. What's up?
SEBASTIAN => Just stopped by to let you know, I'm going out for a bit.
CARTER => Going out? Hey wait a sec!
CARTER => What do you mean going out for a bit?
SEBASTIAN => If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna go crazy.
CARTER => But you're not supposed to leave the compound.
SEBASTIAN => Why not?
CARTER => That's the rule.
SEBASTIAN => Yes, but I made that rule. It's my rule and I'm changing it.
CARTER => You can't just change it.
SEBASTIAN => Carter, I was suppose to be like this for three days. Three fucking days and I'll be damned if I'm going to spend the rest of my life as a prisoner in this godforsaken dump. Now I'm going out. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Okay?
CARTER => Shit.
CARTER => Yeah, it's Carter. We got a problem.
MARINE GUARD => Hey, Doc. Haven't seen you for awhile?
SEBASTIAN => Yeah, well. You know how it in sometimes.
MARINE GUARD => You got that right, sir. I was beginning to worry 'cause your car hadn't moved.
SEBASTIAN => Thanks, but everything's cool.
MATT => He could be anywhere. Hell he could be right behind us.
LINDA => I'll meet you at the lab. I'm gonna swing by his place, just in case.
MATT => See you there.
LINDA =>  I don't want him to see.
MATT =>  What a mess.
SEBASTIAN => Shit.
SEBASTIAN => Don't even think it...
SEBASTIAN =>  Once...just once.
LINDA => Sebastian?
LINDA => Sebastian?
LINDA => Oh shit.
LINDA => Yeah, Matt, it's me. He was here. No. He's taken his make-up off. I don't know...He must be outside somewhere. I don't know where he went. I'm coming back to the lab. How? How'm I supposed to do that? I CAN'T FUCKING SEE HIM! We're going on alpha call.  I want everyone at the lab now. We're gonna need thermal visors and we may need tranqs.
JANICE => What are the tranqs for?
LINDA => Use your imagination.
JANICE => Are you saying he's dangerous?
MATT => We're just saying we need to be cautious.
LINDA => The Metro stops running after midnight and he's on foot, so he can't have gotten too far.
CARTER => Look, this isn't a monkey we're talking about. It's Dr. Caine. Don't you think you're over reacting?
LINDA => This program is classified. If he's out there it means someone might find out about him. He could destroy the whole program.
SEBASTIAN => Relax, Linda. No one's gonna find out.
MATT => Where the hell have you been?
SEBASTIAN => I got a little stir crazy, so I went to my apartment to pick up some stuff.
LINDA => Bullshit! I went to your apartment and I happen to know you did a helluva lot more than pick some stuff up.
SEBASTIAN => What are you talking about?
LINDA => You, of all people How could you?
LINDA => You put yourself and this project at risk.
SEBASTIAN => Just what did you see in my apartment?
LINDA => I saw your face and your clothes.
MATT => It was bad enough you left without an escort, but to take off the...  out in public?
SEBASTIAN => Don't make a mountain out of molehill. I didn't let anyone see me.
LINDA => That's not good enough. When you're outside the lab there are a thousand variables none of us can control. It's just not safe for you to be out there.
SEBASTIAN => Come on, Linda. You don't expect me to be some kind of prisoner.
LINDA => You volunteered for this, Sebastian. You knew going in there could be consequences.  For the security of this project, I'm gonna have to ask you to confine yourself to the compound.
SEBASTIAN => I'm still Project Leader, Linda. It's my decision to make.
LINDA => You're right. It's your decision. But if you leave the compound again, I'll notify the oversight committee. Then they can make the decision. You understand?
SEBASTIAN => Matt?
MATT => Sorry, man. You'd do the same if it were the other way around.
LINDA => Pack 'em up... Everyone go home.
LINDA => Hold still.
SEBASTIAN =>  How much blood do you think you've taken so far?
LINDA => Not enough to worry about.
SEBASTIAN => Every day... feels like you're sucking me dry.
SEBASTIAN => It's funny. All these years I've known you, I never pegged you for a megalomanic.
LINDA => What are you talking about?
SEBASTIAN => The shoe being on the other foot. You getting to run things.
LINDA => I didn't ask for this, Caine. But when a classified experiment disappears in the middle of the night, someone's gotta run the show.  Look, I know how hard this has been for you.
SEBASTIAN => Don't patronize me.  And for the record, you've got no idea what it's like. I get up every morning and you people stick needles in me. You bombard me with radiation until I vomit. And then at six it's over for you. You get to go home. But Sebastian is still here. Sebastian can't leave, or else. That's the worst part, you know. Here I have this ... this GIFT and I can't even use it.
LINDA => Now it's a gift?
SEBASTIAN => You're goddamn right it's a gift. And if you weren't so goddamned short sighted, I'd be out there right now trying to master it.
LINDA => Where're you going?
SEBASTIAN => Looks like I'm going nowhere.
MATT => Come on, man. We've got a ton of tests scheduled today.
SEBASTIAN => Do them yourself.
LINDA => Want to talk about it?
SEBASTIAN => No.
LINDA => "We are the hollow men, the stuffed men, headpieces filled with straw."
SEBASTIAN => Funny, huh? I've become a literal metaphor.
LINDA => I don't want to fight you. I just want what's best for the program.
SEBASTIAN => I know. And you being right doesn't make it any easier for me.
LINDA => You can be scared. That's okay.
SEBASTIAN => I'm not scared of being stuck this way. With a little more make-up and practice, I could...  ... pass. Y'know, get by in the world. But the testing...
LINDA => You're talking like you've given up. It's only been a few months.
SEBASTIAN => What if it's years? I don't know how much more testing I can take.
MATT => 60% reversion. 70% ... 75% ... 80% ... 85 ...
SEBASTIAN => We've got it. We've got it.
MATT => 93% ... 95%... 95%
LINDA => That's all we need.
SEBASTIAN => Come on, baby. Come on.
MATT => Full quantum cascade at 95%.  I'm sorry.
SEBASTIAN => You're sorry? You're fucking sorry?
SEBASTIAN => Six weeks of this shit and you're sorry!
JANICE => I don't blame him.
LINDA => I'll go talk to him.
MATT => Leave him alone. He just needs to blow off some steam.
FRANK => Yeah?
SEBASTIAN => I'm going to the lab.
FRANK => Don't you sleep?
SEBASTIAN => Waste of time. Da Vinci never slept.
FRANK => Okay. I'm here if you need me.
MATT => How'd it go?
FRANK => Quiet. He worked in the lab till about 10:30 and then went to sleep.
SEBASTIAN => Ah, my two favorite people. Good morning.
LINDA => Good morning.
MATT => Why so cheery this morning?
SEBASTIAN => You know some days you just wake up feeling the world is full of potential. Like your eyes have been opened.
MATT => I'm happy if I make it to my coffee machine.
LINDA => I restructured the third genome on your radiated protein strand. Thought you might want to take look.
SEBASTIAN => Cook up a batch and let's see where we go.
LINDA => I thought you'd want to take a look at it.
SEBASTIAN => I trust you. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to have my head examined.
LINDA => I'm telling you, I know him. Something's going on.
MATT => Think he knows about us.
LINDA => If he knew about us, he'd be angry and that wasn't angry.
SEBASTIAN => When you were a kid, you ever dream about being invisible?
CARTER => Sure... all the time.
SEBASTIAN => What did you imagine you'd do?
CARTER => The usual.
SEBASTIAN => What's the usual?
CARTER => Hanging out in the girl's locker room. Kicking Jimmy Margiani's ass.
SEBASTIAN => Jimmy Margiani?
CARTER => School asshole. Drove a red Trans Am. Back then, I was the size of a small planet and made a rather large target.
SEBASTIAN => Ever think up anything along the grand scale?
CARTER => Sure. World domination. Manipulating stock markets, consolidating a political power base. But those are more recent fantasies.
SEBASTIAN => And what if it weren't fantasy? What if you were out there in the world and could do whatever you wanted with no consequences whatsoever. How far would go? I mean... if it were real?
CARTER => I don't know, man. Out in the real world... I mean, there's a responsibility...
SEBASTIAN => Let's say you saw a woman with amazing tits. Would you brush against them?
CARTER => Hell, I try and do that now.
SEBASTIAN => Human nature. So if you could get away with more, would you do more?
CARTER => I read that in a survey at a major university they asked college students "Would you steal if you were guaranteed to get away with it?" 82% said yes.
SEBASTIAN => Eighty two percent? Makes you wonder if the world's ready for what we're doing.
CARTER => So, Doc what did you do?
SEBASTIAN => What do you mean?
CARTER => When you were out.
SEBASTIAN => I just walked around. Y'know.
CARTER => Aw, you just walked around? Come on. There's more, right?
SEBASTIAN => Like what?
CARTER => Man, I'd be walking up to people saying shit like "This is God, go,get a haircut." Or hanging out in the changing room at Victoria's Secret.
SEBASTIAN => Kind of sophomoric, don't you think. Besides, it was late and I wasn't out that long.
CARTER => Well, did you see anybody?
SEBASTIAN => There was this one girl.
CARTER => Yeah? And did you mess with her?
SEBASTIAN => Naw...
SEBASTIAN => Well maybe a little.  I tell you though, a man could get used to it.
SEBASTIAN => Goodnight.
SEBASTIAN => Sorry, didn't mean to frighten you.
LINDA => It's fine. I just didn't know you were there. Goodnight.
LINDA => What was it?
MATT => I don't know. I don't see anything.
MATT => It's like something hit it.
CARTER => Hello?
CARTER => No. No. He's here No, I'm staring at him. He's right there in his room.
LINDA => Thanks. No, just checking. 'Kay, bye.  Phew.
MATT => Relax... it's nothing. Where were we?
SEBASTIAN => Be quiet!
SEBASTIAN => And the cyclops screamed out, "Who is it who blinds me?" and Odysseus replied "Nobody is my name". And the Cyclops raged to his friends "Nobody is killing me. Nobody".
SEBASTIAN => Shhhh. It's Nobody-It's nothing.
SEBASTIAN => Nobody's gonna hurt you.
SARAH => You awake?
SEBASTIAN => I am now.
SARAH => Notice anything unusual last night.
SEBASTIAN => No. Why?
SARAH => Franklin Three. He's dead.
SEBASTIAN => What of?
SARAH => His neck was broken and his windpipe collapsed.
SEBASTIAN => How'd that happen?
SARAH => I thought maybe you could tell me.
SEBASTIAN => Sarah... You saying I had something to do with it?
SARAH => He was alive last night when I left and he was dead this morning. And you were the only one down here.
SEBASTIAN => I was in my room all night.
CARTER => That's all twelve hours.
LINDA => He never left the room.
SARAH => A windpipe doesn't just suddenly collapse. Someone or something killed it.
MATT => You saw the tape. The man was in his chamber.
SARAH => Then we have a problem, because I the cage was locked from the outside. That means it was opened, the dog was killed and the cage was closed and locked again. Only a human could do that.
CARTER => Well, it wasn't me.
MATT => And it wasn't him.
LINDA => Are we sure?
SEBASTIAN => Any big plans for tonight?
LINDA => Quiet night at home. Maybe a book.
SEBASTIAN => Really? Whatever happened to that guy your were seeing?
LINDA => He's still in the picture. Why?
SEBASTIAN => Being locked down here, I'm forced to live vicariously. Someday you'll have to tell me what he's like.
LINDA => Maybe someday I will. See you in the morning.
SEBASTIAN => Au domain.
SEBASTIAN => Hmmm.
LINDA =>  Forgot something.
SEBASTIAN => What the hell?
FRANK => Pretty clever really. All it does is recycle the signal. He flips this switch, it takes a snapshot and that's all we see.
LINDA => Asshole.
JANICE => And you think he's violent?
SARAH => He killed a dog with his bare hands.
FRANK => Dogs aren't people. Are we in any danger?
LINDA => Either way, we aren't equipped to handle this. We have to inform the committee.
JANICE => What if he doesn't come back?
LINDA => They'll go after him.  Who has tonight's shift?
JANICE => I do.
LINDA => Pretend nothing's wrong. Everyone just do what you're doing so he doesn't become suspicious. Okay? Matt and I'll go tell Doctor Kramer and we'll lot the committee deal with it.
KRAMER => I'll call General Caster right now and convene the oversight committee tomorrow.
LINDA => Thank you, sir.
MATT => What do we do in the meantime?
KRAMER => Just sit tight and wait for my call.
MRS. KRAMER => What was that about?
KRAMER => Just a little trouble at work.
MRS. KRAMER => You coming up?
KRAMER => In a minute. I have to make a few calls.
KRAMER => Hello? Hello?
KRAMER => Help! HELP! MARTHA! HELP!
SEBASTIAN => What? No good morning for me? Don't you like me anymore?
LINDA => Oh, sorry. I...I'm in a hurry.
SEBASTIAN => That's okay. It's going to be busy day.
LINDA => When did he say held call?
MATT => He's probably meeting with the committee trying to figure out what to do.
LINDA => I'm gonna call him.
LINDA => Yes, Dr. Kramer please. Excuse me?  When? I'm so sorry.
MATT => What?
LINDA => He's dead. Drowned in his pool last night.
LINDA => Yes, General Thompson please. Thank you.
LINDA => Hello? Hello?
MATT => Let me see that.
MATT => Intercom's working, but there doesn't seem to be an outside line.
LINDA => I'll be right back with help.
ELEVATOR => Authorization please.
LINDA => Foster One Delta Eight Three Five.
ELEVATOR => Authorization invalid. Request denied.
LINDA => That's a first.
ELEVATOR => Authorization please.
LINDA => Foster One Delta Eight Three Five.
ELEVATOR => Authorization invalid. Request denied.
MATT => Let me try mine.
ELEVATOR => Authorization please.
MATT => Kensington Two Romeo One Five Nine.
ELEVATOR => Authorization invalid. Request denied.
LINDA => Tell me this isn't happening.
LINDA => We've got a problem.
MATT => How long before anybody starts looking for us?
LINDA => There's no set check in procedure. It could be weeks.
LINDA => You think you can got in?
FRANK => Already in. It was only a second level encryption.
JANICE => Some security system.
FRANK => Oh the system is fine. It's just I'm just extraordinary.
FRANK => But apparently someone is more extraordinary than me.
MATT => What is it?
FRANK => There's nothing wrong with the system. Our codes have been removed.
MATT => Removed? By who?
FRANK => Here's a clue. Only one code remains.
LINDA => Whose?
FRANK => Dr. Sebastian Caine.
CARTER => He's not in there.
LINDA => Okay, Sebastian. Fun's over. Tell us where you are.
SEBASTIAN => I'm sorry. But I can't lot you turn me in.
LINDA => Sebastian... where are you?
SEBASTIAN => You have no idea what it's like. The power of it. The freedom. I can't let that go.
LINDA => C'mon Sebastian. You're scaring me. Tell me where you are and we can talk about it.
SEBASTIAN => There's nothing to talk about. See ... I've done things that can't be undone.
LINDA => Sebastian! Sebastian!  I want search parties. Thermal goggles and tranquilizers.
JANICE => Dr. Caine? Are you in here? Dr. Caine?
SEBASTIAN => I'm here.
FRANK => Doctor Caine?
LINDA => Sebastian?
MATT => This is bad.
LINDA => There's something over there.
LINDA => Jesus. Oh my god.
MATT => What happened?
LINDA => She was strangled. Multiple blows to her head.
LINDA => We got a big problem here.
LINDA => Get everybody to the conference room. Now!
MATT => Intercom... the phone lines. They're dead.
LINDA => Gimme that.
LINDA => It was just working.
MATT => What the fuck is going on here?
MATT => What?
LINDA => Shhh.
LINDA => Give me the visor.
LINDA => C'mon.
FRANK => Did you find him?
LINDA => Janice is dead.
LINDA => It's clear.
SARAH => The man has checked out of reality.
FRANK => What happened? I don't understand.
CARTER => Isn't it obvious? Right now, we're the only ones who knows he exists. If he gets rid of us, no one knows and he becomes the most powerful man on earth.
FRANK => But he's not a killer.
LINDA => He wasn't. He is now.
MATT => Can you fix the elevator? Restore our codes?
FRANK => It'd take hours to crack the encryptions.
MATT => Right now that sounds like good news.
CARTER => So what do we do until then. Sit around waiting for him to kill us off?
LINDA => No. We find him, before he finds us.
CARTER => You sure this'll work.
LINDA => We designed it to help find the rats we kept dropping in year one. They were too small for thermal scans.
MATT => Systems hot. Activating motion detectors.
LINDA => I've got movement in Corridor Six.
MATT => That's him.
MATT => Got 'em.
LINDA =>  Check. Check.
LINDA => Be careful.
MATT => Just watch our backs. Hey Carter, ready?
CARTER => Let's do it.
LINDA =>  Take a right at the next accessway. He's working his way back to the offices.
MATT =>  If we split up, can we trap him on corridor eight?
LINDA => If he keeps heading in that direction.
MATT => Going Thermal.
LINDA => I lost him. Matt, I lost him.
MATT => He probably just stopped moving.
CARTER => It's me.
MATT => Do you have anything?
CARTER => Nothing.
MATT => How did he get by us?
CARTER => He couldn't.
MATT => Sebastian! We're here to help. Sebastian.
CARTER => There. Behind those pipes. He's not moving.
CARTER => Doctor Caine?  Can you hear me?
MATT =>  We see him. But he's not responding. The heat signature doesn't move.
MATT => C'mon... C'mon...
CARTER => Covered.
MATT => What the...
MATT => Just a vent. Just a goddamn vent
LINDA => He was there.
MATT => Looks like... looks like we're pumping out heat...
LINDA => I got movement again! He's right on top of you!
MATT => No fucking shit!
MATT => Sebastian? Goddamnit! Let him go.
CARTER =>  H...Help... MMmmphg
MATT =>  Where is he? Where the fuck is he?!?
LINDA => Right on top of you.
LINDA => What's going on? Are you okay?
MATT => Carter's down. Hurt bad. Bleeding from a head wound.
LINDA => Matt, he's coming toward you.
MATT => Shit.
LINDA => Got outta there.
LINDA => He's close!
MATT => Goddamnit. The doors are closing. He's shutting me in.
MATT => Where is he?
LINDA => He's coming right at you!
MATT => Where?
LINDA => Twenty, maybe thirty feet.
MATT => Goddamnit, I got thermals all over the place. Eight, maybe ten of them. Must be ghosts.
LINDA => Those signatures ... they're coming from the heating vents.
MATT => I'm starting to lose resolution on my thermals.
LINDA => Get out of there!
FRANK => If the room temperature is the same as his body temperature, thermal visors'll be no good.
LINDA => I'm going!
FRANK => Linda...it's not safe.
LINDA => That's why I'm going.  Corridor eight is clear. Get Carter to the lab. We'll meet you there.
FRANK => But...
LINDA => Do it.
SEBASTIAN => Marco...Polo... Marco... Polo...
SEBASTIAN => Not even close.
SEBASTIAN => So... just out of curiosity, how long has my best friend been fucking my ex- girlfriend.
MATT => Sebastian. Get a hold of yourself. You aren't thinking rationally.
SEBASTIAN => She's a pretty sweet fuck, isn't she?
MATT => Calm down, Sebastian... we can talk this through. It's not too late.
MATT => C'mon Sebastian. Don't do this. I'm your friend.
SEBASTIAN => I'm sorry, but I just feel that our friendship is holding me back. I'm sure you understand.
SARAH => This way.
SARAH => Pulse is weak. Breathing... shallow.
FRANK => He'll be okay.
SARAH => It's pretty severe. We have to get him to the lab.
FRANK => He's got to be okay.
SARAH => For godsakes, help me.
MATT => He was going to kill me.
LINDA => I know. He's gone.
MATT => We've got to got out of here.
MATT => Where is he? Goddamnit, where is he?
LINDA => Habitats.
MATT => Oh god. That's right between us and the lab.
SARAH => His pulse is faint.
SARAH => He's lost a lot of blood. Here. Hold this.
SARAH => Keep applying pressure.
SARAH => Don't move your hand until I got back.
FRANK => Where are you going?
SARAH => This'll hold him but he needs blood.
FRANK => But...
SARAH => Supply is right down the hall. I'll be two seconds.
FRANK => Sarah, wait for the others
SARAH => If I wait, he'll die. Keep pressure on the wound.
MATT => Ahh!  Shit!
MATT => Karl Three. Nice shot.
LINDA => He's let the animals out. It wasn't him we were tracking.
LINDA => You okay?
MATT => It won't kill me unless it gets infected. You?
LINDA => Me .... Don't ask about me. If he freed all the animals, we could have dozens running around the lab.
MATT => So he could be anywhere right now.
MATT => What do we do?
LINDA => Get to the lab, lock the goddamn doors and pray to God Frank can reprogram the elevator.
SARAH => Frank?
SARAH =>  Who's there?
SARAH => Dr. Caine?
SEBASTIAN => You missed.
SARAH => Please no. Let me go. Oh god, let me go.
SARAH => What are you doing? No!
SARAH => Help me! Oh God. Somebody help me! FRANK!
SARAH => No... please. Don't do this to me.
SARAH => What do you want?
SEBASTIAN => You.
SEBASTIAN => I've always liked your feistiness.
FRANK => Sarah! Sarah!  Goddamnit. Stay with me now. Don't you let up... Sarah! Sarah!
FRANK => Sarah! I'm losing him.
FRANK => Did you see her?
LINDA => Where is she?
FRANK => She went to the supply room. Carter needed blood.
LINDA => I said no one goes anywhere alone.
FRANK => She didn't listen.
FRANK => But...
LINDA => He's dead.
LINDA => Oh god. Sarah!
LINDA => No...
FRANK => Her too?
LINDA => This didn't happen. This hasn't happened.
MATT => It happened alright. Now we have to deal with it.
FRANK => Yeah? And just what are we supposed to do now?
SEBASTIAN => Now? Now you die.
LINDA => He's here!
MATT => Where?
LINDA => Sebastian!
LINDA => Sebastian. Sebastian, listen to me.
LINDA => I don't know if you can understand this, but what you're experiencing is a psychological breakdown. This isn't who you are.
SEBASTIAN => I would say that what I am experiencing is psychological awareness. I like you being in complete and absolute control.
LINDA => You goddamn bastard! You goddamn bastard. You're gonna pay for this. I'm going to bring you back to visibility and then I'm going throw your ass in jail.
SEBASTIAN => You're never gonna bring me back Linda. I never want to come back.
LINDA => Fuck you!
SEBASTIAN => Or maybe I'll fuck you. One last time for old times sake.
MATT => Don't listen to him. It's not worth it.
FRANK => Come on, Matt. Let's go get the elevator back on-line so we can got out of this hell hole.
MATT => He does anything, anything at all, come get us. I'll be back to check on you in five.
SEBASTIAN => Imagine you two, carrying on right under my nose. Out of curiosity, what did he give you that I couldn't?
LINDA => Shut up, Sebastian. He's more of a man than you'll ever be.
SEBASTIAN => Okay, sweetie. I'll be quiet. If that's what you want...
LINDA => Sebastian? Sebastian? No.. No...
LINDA => Matt! Frank!
LINDA => Matt! Matt! Frank!
LINDA => Jesus!
SEBASTIAN => Figured it out? You were always so clever.
LINDA => No!
LINDA => Hang on!
MATT => Get out of here!
LINDA =>  You won't get away with this. They'll find out about you. They'll hunt you down.
SEBASTIAN => The villagers with their torches? Lock up your daughters! Sorry, Lin. It's not gonna happen that way.
SEBASTIAN => See, I've spent all my time down here thinking up this plan. When they find you, they'll find a pile of charred corpses. The result of a terrible accident, I'm afraid.
LINDA => How can you be so brutal?
SEBASTIAN => I guess because I don't have to look at myself in the mirror anymore  Remember that first night I was out? I did something bad, just to see if I could get away with it. And when I did, I realized I could have it all. I can kill in broad daylight. And nobody's gonna tell the police they were fucked by a ghost. Anything I desire I can make happen, but not if people know.
MATT => I'm dizzy. I can't feel my legs.
LINDA => Just keep going. I'll fix you later.
LINDA => Matt... Matthew. Stay with me now.
MATT => He surprised us. We weren't expecting...
LINDA => Shhh. Don't talk.
LINDA => We gotta move. Hang on.
MATT => Lin...
MATT => I can't feel anything.
LINDA => You feel that?
MATT => A little...
LINDA => Your losing blood, but he didn't hit the vitals.
LINDA => Sutures and thread.
LINDA => Goddamnit.
MATT => What're you doing?
LINDA => This is temporary.
LINDA => You still with me?
MATT => Barely.
LINDA => Just keeps getting worse.
LINDA => Oh shit.
MATT => There's no way out.
LINDA => There's got to be.
MATT => They say freezing to death isn't so bad. You just kinda pass out.
LINDA => Matt! MATT!
LINDA => We're not dying in here.
ELEVATOR => Authorization please?
SEBASTIAN => Caine. One One One One One.
ELEVATOR => Authorization valid. Thank you.
LINDA => Sebastian!
LINDA => I can't let you leave. Come on out and I'll give you one last chance.
SEBASTIAN => You said it yourself, Lin. I shouldn't hold on to the past.
LINDA => Aaaaaaahhhh!
SEBASTIAN => Oh God!
LINDA => You wanna see God? I'll show you God.
SEBASTIAN => I'm gonna find everyone in your family and kill them-. Your sister... she never liked me. I think I'll go after her and her little boy first.
SEBASTIAN => I just wanted you to know that before you die.
MATT => Thought I'd... thought I'd save you for a change.
MATT => Let's got out of here.
LINDA => Nitro...
MATT => He said it himself... All they'll find is a pile of charred corpses.
LINDA => He's rigged the centrifuge.
MATT => In an enclosed space, he'll wipe out the whole lab.
LINDA => Grab on.
MATT => Forget about me. You go.
LINDA => Fuck you. Give me your hands.
LINDA => Climb!
MATT => But...
LINDA => Climb!
MATT => I can't. I'm going to pass out.
LINDA => Keep moving.
LINDA => Oh God!
MATT => Don't look.
LINDA => Move!
MATT => It's coming down!
LINDA => C'mon. Before it slips.
LINDA => It's him.
MATT => Sebastian, you fuck.
LINDA => Get off me.
MATT => No!
LINDA => Let go of me.
SEBASTIAN => Remember the day we met? You were wearing a red dress and you were so pretty. Now... Now look at you.
MATT => Get off of her!
MATT => Sebastian, stop it.
SEBASTIAN => You fucked it all up.
LINDA => Go to hell.
MARINE GUARD => What happened?
LINDA => We lived.
FADE => OUT:
