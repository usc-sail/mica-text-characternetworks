SANTA => 'Twas a long time ago, quite a bit to be fair In a place that I'm sure you are quite unaware.
SANTA => But our holidays are the result of much fuss And hard work for the worlds that must make them for us
SANTA => See, each holiday town works all year to create Twenty-four special hours, fantastically great.
SANTA => Fleeting twenty-four hours take long to prepare, A full year of planning and plenty of care.
SANTA => For each one, way back when, was alas unaware Of the others' existence, now I've said it -- so there!
SANTA => But once there occurred a calamity SO GREAT! When two of the worlds did collide by mistake...
PUMPKINHEAD => Boys and Girls of every age Wouldn't you like to see something strange? Come with us and you will see... This our town of Halloween!
CREATURE #1 => I am the one hiding under your bed, Teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red.
CREATURE #2 => I am the one hiding under your stairs Fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair.
VAMPIRES => In this town, we call home, Everyone hail to the pumpkin song!
MAYOR => In this town, don't we love it now Everybody's waiting for the next surprise.
GRAVELLY VOICE => 'Round that corner, man, Hiding in a trashcan Something's waiting now to pounce and how you'll--
GRAVELLY-VOICED => TRASHCAN-DWELLING MONSTER -- Scream!  This is Halloween, Red 'n black, slimy green... Aren't you scared?  Well, that's just fine!
WITCHES => Say it once, say it twice, Take the chance and roll the dice Ride with the moon in the dead of night
HANGING TREE => Everybody scream, everybody scream In our town of Halloween.
HANGED MEN => This is Halloween, This is Halloween...
GHOUL => I am the guy with the tearaway face...
GHOUL => Here in a flash and gone without a trace.
SECOND GHOUL => I am the who when you call --
SALLY => -- Who's there?
SECOND GHOUL => I am the wind blowing through your hair.
THIRD GHOUL => I am the shadow on the moon at night, filling your dreams to the brim with fright.
GELATINOUS LUMPS => Tender Lumplings everywhere Life's no fun without a good scare.
CORPSES => That's our job, but we're not mean In our town of Halloween.
MAYOR => -- don't we love it now? Everyone's waiting for the next surprise.
THIRD GHOUL => -- like a banshee make you jump --
SALLY => -- Everyone scream, won't ya Please make way for a special guy...
SALLY => -- King of the Pumpkin Patch.
EVERYONE => This is Halloween, THIS IS HALLOWEEN
JACK => Thank you!
MAYOR => Oh, Jack, you are such a scream!  Isn't he?
ASSEMBLY => Yes, he is!
VAMPIRE => You make sparks fly, Jack.
WITCH #1 => You make oil boil.
WITCH #2 => You make rats shriek.
JACK => I love that.
WITCH #3 => You make flesh crawl...
WITCH #3 =>  ...And wounds suppurate.
JACK => Thank you, thank you, thank you very much!
THIRD GHOUL => What an inspiration to everybody!
SALLY =>  An inspiration...
CORPSE => It was our most horrific Halloween ever!
EVIL SCIENTIST => The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
SALLY => No!
SALLY => Let go!
SALLY => Have it then if you must!
EVIL SCIENTIST => You'll be back.  Sooner or later you'll need this.
MAYOR => Next year'll even be better, you'll see.
HORRIFIC-LOOKING CREATURE => Do you really think so, Jack?
JACK => Of course I do.  It always is, isn't it?
VARIOUS MONSTERS => Always.
MAYOR => We'll have to get on it immediately.  No time for sitting around smugly.
ASSORTED MONSTERS => That's so true...  We've got a lot of work ahead of us.
MORE MONSTERS => Goodnight, everybody! Goodnight, Jack!
SALLY => Oh... it's Jack...  Look at him -- he's so alive... So happy... He's so filled with confidence he could teach the wolves to howl!
SALLY => He'll never notice me.  Why would he?  Why should he?
JACK => There are few who'd deny, at what I do I am the best For my talents are renowned far and wide When it comes to surprises in the moon-lit night, I excel without ever even trying.
JACK => Yet year after year, it's the same routine And I grow so weary of the sound of screams And I, Jack, the PUMPKIN KING! Have grown so tired of the same old thing....
JACK => Oh somewhere deep inside of these bones An emptiness began to grow There's something out there far from my home A longing that I've never known ... I've never known.
JACK => I'm a master of fright, and a demon of light And I'll scare you right out of your pants, boy To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky And I'm known throughout England and France, boy
JACK => Oh, there's an empty place in my bones That calls out for something unknown The fame and praise, come year after year, Does nothing for these empty tears ... these empty tears....
SALLY => JACK!  I KNOW YOU HARDLY KNOW ME, BUT --
SALLY => -- I feel the same way you do...
JACK => No, Zero.
JACK => No.  No playing today, Zero... I'm just not in the mood.
EVIL SCIENTIST => Sally?
EVIL SCIENTIST => You came back.
SALLY => Yes.
EVIL SCIENTIST => For this.
SALLY => Yes.
EVIL SCIENTIST => Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
SALLY => Yes.
EVIL SCIENTIST => Shall we?
EVIL SCIENTIST => You're mine, you know.  I made you.
SALLY => I know.
EVIL SCIENTIST => If you went away, what would become of me?
SALLY => I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
EVIL SCIENTIST => Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
SALLY => I can't help it.
EVIL SCIENTIST => That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
EVIL SCIENTIST => I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
SALLY => I know.
EVIL SCIENTIST => But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
SALLY => That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
EVIL SCIENTIST => Just what?
SALLY => Just me, I suppose...  I'm restless.  I can't help it.
EVIL SCIENTIST => It's a phase, my dear.  It'll pass.  We need to be patient, that's all.
SALLY => That's all....
JACK => Ow!
JACK => Where am I?
JACK => Zero!  Where are we?  We've never been here, have we, boy?
JACK => It's some place new.
MAYOR => Jack?!
MAYOR => Jack?!  You home?!
MAYOR =>  Have you seen Jack?...  Have you seen Jack?...
MAYOR => Where is he?  We had an appointment.
MAYOR => Jack?!  I've got the plans for next year!  See?!
MAYOR => I need to go over them with you so we can get started! Halloween'll be here again in no time!  Three hundred and sixty odd days fly by too fast!
MAYOR =>  Jack!  Please!  I'm only an elected official here!  I can't make decisions!  Jack!  Answer me!
ACCORDION PLAYER => He can't.
MAYOR => Why not?
ACCORDION PLAYER => He's not home.
MAYOR => Where is he?
ACCORDION PLAYER => He hasn't been home all night.
MAYOR =>  Oh...
JACK => What's this?  What's this? There's color everywhere... What's this? There's white things in the air... What's this? I can't believe my eyes I must be dreaming, Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair... What's this?
JACK => What's this?  What's this? There's something very wrong... What's this? There're people singing songs... What's this? The streets are lined with Little creatures laughing, Everybody seems so happy, Have I possibly gone daffy...? What is this...?  What's this?
JACK => There's frost on every window, Oh, I can't believe my eyes, And in my bones I feel a warmth That's coming from inside...
JACK => Oh, look, what's this? They're hanging mistletoe... They kiss -- Why that looks so unique... Inspired! They're gathering around to hear a story, Roasting chestnuts on a fire...  What's this?
JACK => Oh my, what now? The children are asleep...  But look -- There's nothing underneath...  No ghouls No witches here to scream and scare them ... or ensnare them... Only cozy little things Secure inside their dreamland...  What's this?
JACK => The monsters are all missing And the nightmares can't be found And in their place there seems to be Good feeling all around...
JACK => .... Christmastown?  Hmmmmmmmm.
JACK => Incredible.  I'll need proof...
MAYOR => Quiet.  Quiet now.  We all agree that two days is far too long for Jack to have been gone without warning...  Is there anywhere we've forgotten to check?
TWO WITCHES =>  We opened the sarcophagi.
VAMPIRE => I peeked behind the Cyclops' eye.
VAMPIRE =>  I did!...  But he wasn't there...
MAYOR => It's time to sound the alarms...
SALLY =>  Regular dose...  Double dose... Double, double dose.  He'll be able to smell a double, double dose of Deadly Night Shade... Anybody could.
SALLY => Frog's Breath will overpower any smell.
SALLY =>  Sweet Pea...  Where's that Sweet Pea...  Too bitter... Too bitter...
EVIL SCIENTIST => Sally?
EVIL SCIENTIST => Where's my soup?
SALLY =>  Coming...
EVIL SCIENTIST => Good.  I'm hungry.
SALLY =>  A handful of Worm's Wart just for distraction.  It'll throw him off the trail for sure...
SALLY => Lunch.
EVIL SCIENTIST => Excellent.  Over here.  Over here.  Set it down.
EVIL SCIENTIST => Ah...  What's that?...  Worm's Wart!
EVIL SCIENTIST => What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
SALLY =>  Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
EVIL SCIENTIST => Taste it.
SALLY => But why?  It's your lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
EVIL SCIENTIST => Taste it.
SALLY => No.
EVIL SCIENTIST => Why not?
SALLY => I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
EVIL SCIENTIST => There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
EVIL SCIENTIST => Until you taste it, I won't eat a bite.
SALLY => But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
EVIL SCIENTIST => Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
EVIL SCIENTIST => Eat.
EVIL SCIENTIST =>  Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
SALLY => Can't you make other creations?
EVIL SCIENTIST => I could.  Of course I could. But no one would be like you...  I'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like--
SALLY =>  All right...  All right... I'll eat it.
MAYOR => Did anybody think to dredge the lake?
CORPSE => This morning.
WITCH #1 => Hear that?
WITCH #2 => What?
WITCH #3 => Ssh!
VAMPIRE =>  Zero?!
JACK => I'M BACK!
VAMPIRE => Where've you been?
JACK => I can't wait to tell all of you all about it!  Mayor!  Call us a town meeting!
JACK => Listen everyone.  I want to tell you about where I've been!
JACK => There were objects so peculiar They were not to be believed All around things to tantalize my brain. It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen And as hard as I try... I can't seem to describe Like a most improbable dream...
JACK => Here...  Let me show you.
PEOPLE => Ohhhh....
JACK => This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...
VARIOUS PEOPLE => -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!
JACK => If you please!!!
JACK => Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.
VARIOUS PEOPLE => -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?
JACK => That's the point of the thing, not to know!
VARIOUS PEOPLE => -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.
JACK => Listen now, you don't understand. That's not the point of Christmasland.
JACK => Now, pay attention.
JACK => Now we pick up an oversized sock... And bang it like this on the wall.
VARIOUS PEOPLE => -- Oh yes, does it still have a foot? -- Let me see... --                Let me look... -- Is it rotted and covered with gook?
JACK => Let me explain.
VARIOUS PEOPLE => -- Small toys? --             Do they bite? --                           Do they snap? -- Or perhaps they just spring out and Scare girls and boys.
MAYOR => What a splendid idea -- This Christmas sounds fun. Why I fully endorse it! Let's try it at once!
JACK => Everyone, please, now not so fast. There's something here that you don't quite grasp.
JACK =>  Well, I may as well give them what they want.
JACK => And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last For the ruler of this Christmasland... Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice Least, that is what I've come to understand.
JACK => And on a dark, cold night Under full moonlight He flies off into a fog Like a vulture in the sky... And they call him -- Sandy Claws.
CROWD => OOOOH....
JACK =>  Well, at least they're excited, But they don't understand That special kind of feeling ... In Christmasland.
JACK => Oh well....
JACK => It's not quite right; something's wrong... But what?...
SALLY =>  Who could that be?
JACK => Good morning.
SALLY =>  Y-you don't have to say that. You don't need to pretend.  Not with me.
JACK => Is the doctor in?
EVIL SCIENTIST =>  Who is it, Sally?
JACK =>  It's Jack Skellington.
EVIL SCIENTIST =>  Jack!  What a surprise, my boy, a rare pleasure indeed.  Come on back... I'm in the laboratory.
SALLY =>  Jack Skellington was here this morning.
EVIL SCIENTIST => Uh-huh.
SALLY => He stayed a long time.
SALLY => When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
EVIL SCIENTIST => He's conducting experiments of his own.
SALLY => Experiments?
SALLY => Dear Doctor...  Please don't come after me again.  Please let me go this time.  I am all grown up and need to find my own life now.  I hope you will understand, some day at least. Signed -- Sally.  P.S. I'll come visit very soon.  P.P.S. There's fresh soup in the 'fridge.  P.P.P.S. It isn't spiked.
JACK => Sooner or later this Christmas will yield up its secrets to me.  I'll crack it!  I will!
TWO VAMPIRES =>  Something's up with Jack, something's up with Jack...
THREE VAMPIRES => Don't know if we're ever going to get him back.
SLATHERING BEAST => He's all alone up there, locked away inside...
CROWD => Something's up with Jack... ... Something's up with Jack... ... Something's up with Jack...
JACK => Christmastime is buzzing in my skull. Will it let me be?  I cannot tell. There're so many things I cannot grasp... When I think I've got it, then at last Through my bony fingers it does slip Like a snowflake in a fiery grip.
JACK => Or perhaps it's really not as Deep as I've been led to think. Am I trying much too hard...? Of course!  I've been too close to see! The answer's right in front of me!
JACK => You know I think this Christmas thing -- It's not as tricky as it seems. And why should they have all the fun? It should belong to anyone... Not anyone, in fact, but me! Why, I could make a Christmas tree. And there's no reason I can find That I couldn't handle Christmastime.
JACK =>  EUREKA!
CROWD => Ahhh....
SALLY =>  Oh Jack...  Now what fever has engulfed you?  Your poor sensitive mind...
SALLY =>  Jack, you must let go of this insanity.  Don't make this mistake.  Taking over Christmas is no way to fill the gaping hole you feel inside.
MAYOR => DR. FINKELSTEIN TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE!  DR. FINKELSTEIN, STEP RIGHT INSIDE!
MAYOR =>  DR. FINKELSTEIN!  WE'RE LOOKING FOR DR. FINKELSTEIN!
ONE VAMPIRE => What kind of noise is that for a baby to make?
JACK => Can you handle it?
OTHER VAMPIRE => We can improve it too.
JACK => I knew it!
JACK => Doctor -- just the man I wanted to see.
JACK => I need some of these.
EVIL SCIENTIST => These...?  Their construction should be very simple, I think.
MAYOR => DR. FINKELSTEIN!
EVIL SCIENTIST =>  Right here.
MAYOR => It's about time.
LOCK => We're here!  You sent for us!
SHOCK => Specifically.
BARREL => By name.
LOCK => Lock.
SHOCK => Shock.
BARREL => Barrel.
MAYOR => Oogie Boogie's Boys to see you, Jack!
JACK => Excellent.
MAYOR => What a smashing success our Christmas will be!
JACK => I have a very important, very delicate job for you.
LOCK => I wanna do it...
BARREL => ... Let's draw straws.
SHOCK => Jack said we should work together.
BARREL => Three of a kind...
LOCK => ... Birds of a feather.
SHOCK => Now and forever...
LOCK => First we're going to set some bait Inside a nasty trap and wait. When he comes a-sniffing we will Snap the trap and close the gate.
SHOCK => Wait!  I've got a better plan To catch this big red lobster man. Let's pop him in a boiling pot And when he's done we'll butter him up!
BARREL => Then Mr. Oogie Boogie Man Can take the whole thing over then. He'll be so pleased I do declare That he will cook him rare...
SHOCK => I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.
LOCK => You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.
BARREL => He'll be so pleased by our success That he'll reward us too I bet. Perhaps he'll make his special brew Of snake and spider stew...
SHOCK => We're his little henchman And we take our job with pride.
LOCK => I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.
BARREL => I'm not the dumb one...
SHOCK => ... You're no fun.
LOCK => Shut up and listen...!
LOCK => I've got something, listen now, This one is real good, you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.
BARREL => Now in the box, we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...
SALLY =>  Jack, you must let go of this insanity...  This is a mistake...
JACK => Okay.  Now you.
JACK => Perfect!...  Now let's try this...
JACK =>  Thanks!  You're the absolute best!
JACK => Hi.  I've saved a really special job for you.
JACK =>  I want you to be the one who makes my Sandy Claws outfit.
JACK => I know you can do it.
JACK => It's bright red, the reddest red you can imagine -- both the jacket and the pair of pants... The boots are black.  There's a big black belt that goes around the middle...  Oh, and there's white trim on the cuffs and collar.
SALLY => Are you sure, Jack?
JACK => Am I sure?
JACK => Well... the trim is traditionally white from everything I've studied, but if you think green would give it more dash...  I trust your judgement.  I know you'll do a great job.  Whatever you decide!
JACK =>  That's not Sandy Claws!
SHOCK => It isn't?
BARREL => Who is it then?
JACK =>  Not Sandy Claws!
LOCK => We followed your instructions.
BARREL => We went through the door...
SHOCK => ...In the tree.
JACK => Which door!?
LOCK => The door.
JACK => WELL, TAKE HIM BACK!
JACK => I'm very sorry for the inconvenience, sir.
JACK => Shall I send somebody else for Sandy Claws?
BARREL => Not at all!
SHOCK => We can handle it.
LOCK => We'll get it right this time --
JACK => I told you -- there's more than one door!  Sandy Claws is behind the door shaped like this --
LOCK => Got it!
JACK =>  Take him home first.  And apologize again.  Be careful with Sandy Claws when you catch him!  Treat him nicely!
SALLY => If only he would come back to his senses...
JACK => It's perfect!  It couldn't be more perfect!
JACK => Something's missing... but what?  I've got the beard, the coat, the boots, the belt--
LOCK => This time we really did!
BARREL => He sure is big, Jack...
SHOCK => And heavy...
JACK => Sandy Claws!  Himself!  In person!  I can hardly believe it!  What a pleasure it is to meet you!
JACK => Why, you have hands...  You don't have claws at all...
JACK =>  Surprised, aren't you?  I knew you would be!  But you haven't seen anything yet...
JACK => You don't need to have another worry about Christmas this year.  Not a single care. We've seen to every detail.
JACK => Consider this a vacation, Sandy, a reward.  You've worked hard for a long time.  It's your turn to take it easy. Leave everything to me... You're going to be so pleased. You just relax and enjoy yourself while you're here. (to Lock, Shock & Barrel) See that he's comfortable, boys...
JACK => Just a second, fellas.
JACK => Of course!  That's what I'm missing....  You don't mind if I borrow it, do you?  Thanks!
SALLY =>  There must be something... There must be something... There must be something I can do to stop him...  I know! I'll make him some tea!
BARREL => Where're we taking him?
SHOCK => Where?
LOCK => To Oogie Boogie's place, of course...  There isn't any place in the whole world more comfortable than that, is there?
LOCK => And Jack said to make him comfortable, didn't he?
MAYOR => ...Think of us as you soar triumphantly through the sky, outshining any star, your silhouette a dark blot breaking the perfect circle of the moon...  We who are left behind here will surely be thinking of you.
MAYOR => You who are our pride; you who are our glory; you who have frightened millions into an early grave; you who have devastated --
JACK => Oh no...!
JACK => I'll never get the sleigh off the ground in this.  The reindeer can't see an inch in front of their noses...
VAMPIRE VOICE => This fog's as thick as...
MONSTER VOICE =>  ...Jellied brains.
VAMPIRE VOICE => Yeah...
JACK =>  There go my hopes, my plans, my dreams... the tall-tales, the legends, the lies...
CORPSE VOICE =>  There goes Christmas...
JACK =>  No, Zero...  Not now...  Down, boy...
JACK =>  Hey!  WAIT A MINUTE!
JACK => Where did I put that book...? I know it's in here somewhere...  Here it is...
JACK => 'Zero with your nose so bright, Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?'
JACK => We're off!
LITTLE BOY =>  Santa?
JACK => Merry Christmas!
JACK => And what is your name?
JACK => I bet I have a special present for you anyway!
JACK => There you go, sonny!
JACK => YOU'RE WELCOME!!!
POLICE SERGEANT =>  Police station...  Where did you spot him?...  As fast as we can...  Police station...  I know, I know.  A skeleton. Where are you?...  Right... Just keep calm...  Turn off all the lights.  Make sure the doors are locked...  Hello? Police station...
RADIO BROADCAST => Someone parading as Santa Claus is ruining Christmas!... Reports are pouring in from all over the globe that an impostor is shamelessly impersonating Santa Claus and--
RADIO BROADCAST => -- mocking and mangling this joyous holiday.  Gruesome nightmares have replaced the visions of sugarplums that should be dancing in our children's heads.  Whole families scream in terror.  The authorities assure us that, at this moment, the military is mobilizing to stop whoever it is that is perpetrating this heinous crime...  The monster must and will be stopped. Santa Claus! -- wherever you are.  Come back!  Come back and set things right!  The whole world is in a panic!
SALLY => I've got to help Jack!
SANTA =>  OUT!  LET ME OUT!  I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE NOW!  IT'S CHRISTMAS!!!
LOCK => You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
SHOCK => Maybe he doesn't know...
BARREL => He has to know...
LOCK => Everybody knows about--
OOGIE BOOGIE => Huh?
OOGIE BOOGIE => Ooo la la...
SALLY =>  Sandy...
SALLY =>  Ssh.  I'm here to help you.
SANTA =>  Get me out of here!
SANTA => It's no use...
SALLY => You discourage too easily. Just hang on.
JACK => Doesn't that look fun, Zero?! They're celebrating!  They're thanking us for doing such a good job!
JACK =>  Whoa!  Careful down there, you guys!  That was a pretty close shave!  It's okay, boy...  Head higher.
OOGIE BOOGIE => Huh?
MAYOR => I knew this Christmas thing was a bad idea...  I had a feeling in my bones...
JACK => Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!
OOGIE BOOGIE => Now what am I going to do with you two?
SALLY => You try anything and you just wait 'til Jack gets back.
OOGIE BOOGIE => You were saying?
JACK =>  I thought I could be Santa.  I thought I could be better than Santa.  And what did I do instead?  Instead I killed Christmas.
OOGIE BOOGIE => Scrawny ol' things -- they haven't eaten in centuries. I'd say it's about time we put some meat on their bones, don't you?
JACK => I should say so.
OOGIE BOOGIE => Jack!  How great to see you. We were all worried about you. I was just giving our guests here a... a tour of the place. I told them it was dangerous, but they insisted on a closer look.  What could I do?
JACK => How about the whole show?
SALLY =>  We heard you'd been pulverized to bone dust.
JACK => For what I did, I deserve to be bone dust.
JACK => This is where it belongs...  I was only trying to do a good job, but I made a real mess of everything.  I'm sorry.
SANTA => No time to talk now...  I've got to go fix Christmas!
JACK => I hope it's not too late for him to set Christmas right.
JACK => Well, Zero... I guess it's just you and me...  ...And Sally.  She sure stuck by us, didn't she?
VAMPIRE VOICE => Look!
WITCH VOICE => White thing's...
JACK =>  It is snow...  But how?
JACK => My dearest friend, if you don't mind I'd like to join you by your side Let's sit together, you and I Alone, where we can watch the sky.
SANTA => And finally, everything worked out just fine -- Christmas was saved, though there wasn't much time.
