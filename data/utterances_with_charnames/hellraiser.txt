A Screenplay => by Clive Barker
CENOBITE =>  It's over ...
LARRY => It's one of these.
JULIA => We're going to freeze to death.
LARRY => 0.K.  0.K.
JULIA => Maybe somebody changed the lock.
LARRY =>  Like who?
JULIA => Just a thought -
LARRY => Ah!
LARRY => Success.
LARRY => Well.  This is it.
JULIA => It smells damp.
LARRY => It's just been empty a while.
LARRY =>  Besides, it's an old house.
JULIA => How long since you were here?
LARRY => The best part of ten years.
LARRY => I wanted to sell it off at one point, after the old Lady died, but I couldn't get Frank to agree.
LARRY =>  Christ.  It's not been touched.
LARRY => Look at this.
JULIA => Why didn't he want to sell it?
LARRY =>  I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
JULIA => Not exactly modern.
LARRY =>  We'll sell it.  Sell everything.
JULIA => I thought half of it was your brother's?
LARRY => He won't complain.  He can pay off some of his creditors.
LARRY => You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it.  She'll love it.
JULIA => You mean we're moving in?
LARRY => You don't like it?
JULIA => It's better than Brooklyn.
LARRY => You're still blaming me.
JULIA => No.  I'm not.
LARRY => You wanted to come back to London.  We came back.
JULIA => All right.
LARRY => So what's the argument?
JULIA =>  No argument.
LARRY => Oh Christ.  Julia ...
LARRY =>  Shit.
JULIA => Larry!
LARRY => I hear you.
LARRY => Where are you?
JULIA =>  In here.
JULIA => Squatters?
LARRY => Frank.
JULIA => He's here?
LARRY => He's been here.  There's stuff in the kitchen.  He must have made a hasty exit.
LARRY => Hello ...?
LARRY =>  Is there anybody there?
LARRY =>  There's nobody there -
LARRY => I'm surprised it's even connected ...
LARRY => Who's there?
KIRSTY =>  Daddy?
LARRY => Kirsty?
KIRSTY => I got through.
LARRY => Where are you?
KIRSTY => I found a room.
LARRY =>  What did you say?
KIRSTY => I said: I found a room.
LARRY => I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
KIRSTY =>  No Dad.
LARRY => You'd like the house.
KIRSTY => YOU'D like my room.
LARRY => Do you want me to come over?
KIRSTY =>  No, no.  Not just yet.  It needs ... er ... some work.
LARRY => Well I want you to see the house.
KIRSTY => I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
KIRSTY =>  Great.
LARRY => Well come over, will you? See the place?
KIRSTY => Maybe tomorrow.  I got to go look for a job.
LARRY => O.K. Honey. Well you take care. I love you.
KIRSTY => I love you too.
LARRY => Well?
JULIA =>  Why not?
LARRY =>  We'll move in Sunday.
1ST MAN => We're not going to get it in.
2ND MAN => Tip it!  Tip it!
LARRY => Wait!  Wait!  Watch the fucking paint work.
1ST MAN => Look, do you want the bed in or not?
LARRY => Just take it slowly.
1ST MAN => Oh, sod you.
2ND MAN => Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
LARRY => It'll go in.
1ST MAN => Famous last fucking words.
LARRY =>  Alright, let's give it another try.
2ND MAN =>  Do you really need this bed, lady?
LARRY => How are you doing through there?
JULIA => It looks like a bomb's dropped.
2ND MAN => Got any beer?
JULIA => There's some in the 'fridge.
LARRY => I'll get it.
2ND MAN =>  It's my lucky day.
KIRSTY => Hi.
2ND MAN => Want to buy a bed?
KIRSTY => Not much.
KIRSTY => Dad?
LARRY => Honey!
KIRSTY => Big house.
LARRY => You like?
KIRSTY => Me like.
LARRY => I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
KIRSTY => Is Julia here?
LARRY => Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh?  She hates moving.
KIRSTY =>  Suprise.
LARRY =>  Kirsty.
KIRSTY => O.K.  I'll be nice.  You get on with the muscle work.  I'll make myself some coffee.
LARRY => Kitchen's through on your left
2ND MAN => That your daughter?
LARRY => Uh-huh.
2ND MAN =>  Got her mother's looks.
LARRY => Her mother's dead.
2ND MAN => Oh.
LARRY => Julia's my second wife.
2ND MAN =>  Lucky man.
LARRY => Damn right.  Now are we going to move the bed or not?
FRANK => Can I come in?
FRANK => Can I come in?
KIRSTY => Shit!  Shit!
LARRY =>  Are you O.K.?
KIRSTY =>  Sure.
FRANK => You're Julia, right?
JULIA => That's right.  Who are you?
FRANK =>  I'm brother Frank.
JULIA =>  Oh.
FRANK => I came for the wedding.
JULIA => Oh.  Oh yes.
FRANK => Well can I come in or not?
JULIA => I'm sorry.  Of course.  You're very welcome.
FRANK => That's nice to know.  Have you got a towel?
KIRSTY => Have you got a towel?
JULIA => Kirsty.
KIRSTY => Hi.  I got soaked.
JULIA => There's a towel in the bath- room.
KIRSTY => Which is where?
JULIA => Just to your left.
KIRSTY => Did Dad tell you I got a room, by the way?  Waterloo.  Centre of the known universe.
1ST MAN => Have you got it?
2ND MAN => I've got it.  I told you -
LARRY => Wait!  Wait!
JULIA => Well?
FRANK => I don't want to see the dress.
JULIA => But you said -
FRANK => I don't want to see the dress.
FRANK => You know what I want.
FRANK => I want you.
FRANK => That's better
JULIA => What about Larry -
FRANK => Forget him.
LARRY => Slowly, will you?  Slowly!
JULIA => Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.
JULIA =>  Oh Frank ...
LARRY =>  Will you take the weight while I take a step up?
LARRY => Christ!
1ST MAN => What's the problem?
LARRY => My fucking hand!
LARRY => You fucking ass-holes.
1ST MAN => Who are you calling a fucking ass-hole?  It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
LARRY => ... Oh Christ ...
LARRY => ... oh ... Christ ...
KIRSTY => What's happening?
2ND MAN => We're leaving.
KIRSTY => Where's my father?
1ST MAN => He's fucked off.
2ND MAN =>  Eh ... LANGUAGE.
1ST MAN => Sorry.  He's gone upstairs.  So we're fucking off too.
2ND MAN => Will you sign for the bed?
KIRSTY => Sure.
LARRY =>  ... Julia ...
JULIA => What have you done?
LARRY => I cut myself.
JULIA => Is it deep?
LARRY => I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
JULIA => You're NOT going to faint.
LARRY =>  Shit.
JULIA => Let me see.
JULIA => It's probably going to need stitches.
LARRY => I'm going to throw up.
JULIA => No, you're not.
JULIA => Take it slowly.
LARRY => So damn stupid.
JULIA => You're done worse.
LARRY => I'll be scarred for life.
JULIA => No you won't.
KIRSTY => What happened?
JULIA => Just an accident.  He's all right.  Will you drive?  He needs stitches.
KIRSTY => Sure.
JULIA => The keys are in the kitchen.
LARRY => - always hated the sight of my own blood.  I go out like a light. Anybody else's?  no problem.  But mine ... you know ... goes straight to my head.  Anyhow, this damn doctor's poking around and I'm saying: I'm going to pass out, and he's saying, no you're not, no you're not.  Next thing I know -
LARRY => - I wake up On the floor.
BILL => Probably thought you'd sue.
LARRY => I should do it!
EVELYN => Doctors -
LARRY => I know.  And he's saying: I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
BILL => HE'S sorry.
LARRY => Right ... (he has picked up the brandy bottle) Anyone for more?
EVELYN =>  No ... no ... I ...
LARRY => Come on, you're only young once -
LARRY =>  What are you drinking, love?
KIRSTY =>  I've forgotten.
LARRY => Steve?
STEVE => We're on the Cointreau.
KIRSTY => That's right.  Cointreau.
STEVE => I'll do it.
KIRSTY => I won't be able to stand.
STEVE => So lie down.
JULIA => Would you excuse me?  I think I'm going to go to bed.
LARRY => Are you O.K.?
BILL =>  Christ.  I think it's time we were away -
LARRY => Bill?  Absolutely not.  Sit down.  We've got celebrating to do.
STEVE =>  It was a wonderful meal.
EVELYN =>  Oh it was.  It was wonderful.
JULIA => I'm glad you enjoyed it.
EVELYN => See you again soon.
BILL => You must come round.
EVELYN => Yes.  You must.  We're so happy you're back.
JULIA =>  That's nice.  Well ... goodnight.
EVELYN => Does it still hurt?
LARRY => Only when I laugh.
JULIA => Who's there?
FRANK =>  Julia.
JULIA => Oh my God.
FRANK => Don't look at me.
JULIA => Who are you?
FRANK => I said: don't look.
JULIA => Tell me who you are.
FRANK => Frank.
JULIA => No.  God no.
FRANK => Believe me.  It's me.  It's really me.
JULIA => What happened to you?
FRANK => His blood ... on the floor ... It brought me back.
JULIA => Back from where?
FRANK => Just help, will you?  Please God, help me -
STEVE => You're not going?
KIRSTY => Just upstairs.
STEVE => Need any help?
KIRSTY => I AM house-trained.
STEVE =>  No ... I meant ...
LARRY => It's round on the left -
KIRSTY => I know.
FRANK => ... somebody ...
JULIA => Ssh!
FRANK => You can't let me stay like this. Please.  You can't.
JULIA => What do you want me to do.
FRANK => The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same.  Or I'll slip back ...
FRANK =>  You have to heal me.
KIRSTY => Hello?
KIRSTY => Oh, it's you.
STEVE => Kirsty?
KIRSTY =>  I'm here.
STEVE => I thought we'd lost you.
KIRSTY =>  I'm coming!  Sleep well.
KIRSTY => You know I do know the way home.
STEVE => It's late.
KIRSTY => Not that late.
STEVE => Please.  I want to see you home.  All right?
KIRSTY =>  All right.  No.  That's nice.
STEVE => If there's a train.
KIRSTY => What do we do if there isn't?
STEVE => We walk.
STEVE => Why don't you stay at Larry's house?  There's plenty of room.
KIRSTY => Yeah, there's room.  And there's Julia.
STEVE => I see.
KIRSTY => She's so damn ... English.
STEVE => Meaning what?
KIRSTY => Oh, I don't know.  Up-tight. Frigid.
STEVE => I beg your pardon?
KIRSTY =>  There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
STEVE => We're not all frigid.
KIRSTY => Oh no?
STEVE => Oh no.
KIRSTY => It's not what I heard.
STEVE =>  Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
FRANK => Well?
JULIA => Yes.
1ST CUSTOMER => Excuse me, Miss -
2ND CUSTOMER => I'd like some more lager.
1ST CUSTOMER => Miss!
KIRSTY => In a moment.
2ND CUSTOMER => Did you hear me?
STEVE => Hey, sex-bomb -
KIRSTY => You keep your -  Oh.  Hi.
STEVE => I just called in.  How about tonight?
KIRSTY => I don't finish till twelve.
STEVE => I'm a late riser.
2ND CUSTOMER => What do you have to do to get some service around here?
STEVE => Catch you later.
PRUDHOE => Not much fun, is it?
JULIA => What?
PRUDHOE => Drinking alone.
JULIA => Not much.
PRUDHOE => I wonder, maybe ...
JULIA => Why not?
PRUDHOE =>  What are you drinking?
JULIA => Just soda.
PRUDHOE => Plain soda?
JULIA => Please.
PRUDHOE => I try not to drink at lunch- time.  Makes me sleepy in the afternoon.  You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway.  No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
JULIA =>  That depends.
PRUDHOE => Oh?
PRUDHOE => You know it's not often I ... you know ...
JULIA => There's a first time for every- thing.
PRUDHOE => I suppose that's right.
JULIA => You want something to drink?
PRUDHOE => I'm already way over my usual limit.  You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
PRUDHOE => Oh, come on. (he takes hold of her breast) It's what you brought me here for, isn't it?
JULIA => Yes.  I just think we'd be better off upstairs.
PRUDHOE => Oh.  Oh fine.
PRUDHOE => This your place?
JULIA => Let's not talk about it.
PRUDHOE => No personal details, right?
JULIA => Right.
PRUDHOE => You know, you're incredible -
JULIA => Come on in.  Make yourself at home.
PRUDHOE => There's no bed.
JULIA => That's right.
PRUDHOE => Huh?
JULIA => I prefer the floor.
PRUDHOE => First time for everything, right?
JULIA => Right.
JULIA => Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
PRUDHOE => Yeah, why don't I?
PRUDHOE =>  Why don't you do the same?
JULIA => Maybe I will.
PRUDHOE =>  You know, you're very beautiful.
JULIA => Am I?
PRUDHOE => You know you are.  Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
PRUDHOE => Oh Christ.
JULIA => What's wrong?
PRUDHOE => Too much drink.  Better empty my bladder.
PRUDHOE => I'll be a moment.
PRUDHOE => The door's stuck.
PRUDHOE => Don't ... I ... please ... I'm sorry ...
JULIA => Enough?
FRANK => Don't look at me.
JULIA => Jesus Christ.
FRANK =>  Do I disgust you?
FRANK => See?   It's making me whole again.
FRANK =>  Come to Daddy.  I only want to touch ...
LARRY =>  Sweetheart?
LARRY =>  Where are you?
LARRY => Are you there?
FRANK => Who's a pretty boy then?
LARRY =>  Julia?
LARRY => Are you there?
LARRY => Julia?
JULIA =>  I'm here.
LARRY =>  Sweetheart ... I've been calling you.
JULIA => Just feeling a bit sick.
LARRY => Oh, babe ...
JULIA => I'll be O.K.  Just leave me be a while.
LARRY => Can I get you anything?
JULIA => Maybe a brandy.
LARRY => Sure.
JULIA => I'll be down in a minute
LARRY => O.K.
JULIA =>  Frank?
FRANK => I'm hurting
JULIA => Hurting.
FRANK => My nerves ... are beginning to work again.
JULIA => Good.
FRANK => One more.  Maybe two -
JULIA => Who?
FRANK => The Cenobites.  It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
LARRY => Julia?   Are you all right?
JULIA => Just a moment.  Put on some music will you babe?
LARRY => O.K.
FRANK => Poor Larry.  Obedient as ever.
JULIA => Keep your voice down.
FRANK => Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
JULIA => You're hurting.
FRANK => You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me.  Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before.  We belong to each other now, for better or worse ...
STEVE => What are you doing?
STEVE => Christ.  What was that about?
LARRY => Hello?
LARRY => I'm O.K., honey.  It's all right ...
KIRSTY => I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
LARRY => Never better.  You sleep well.
KIRSTY => Yeah.
LARRY => I love you, honey.
KIRSTY => I love you too.
JULIA => Who was it?
LARRY => Kirsty.
FRANK =>  Kirsty.
VICTIM => You're sure we're not going to be interrupted -
JULIA => Quite sure.
VICTIM => Only I like to be careful.
JULIA => Well?
FRANK => Better.  Much better.  I'd like some clothes.  And maybe a cigarette.
JULIA => Then you tell me ... you explain what happened to you?
FRANK => Of course.
FRANK => I wanted access to experiences ... pleasures ... that only they could offer ...
JULIA => The Cenobites.
FRANK => That's what they call themselves. They're not human.  Maybe they were once, but they're not now. They rearrange their own flesh for pleasure.
JULIA => And the box?
FRANK => It cost me a fortune.  All I had.  It's a puzzle you see. You solve it, and the Cenobites come through ...
JULIA => Where from?
FRANK => God knows.  Sometimes I think they're just behind the walls ...
JULIA => So they cheated you
FRANK => Oh no.  They kept to their bargain.  They gave me experiences I'd never forget ...
FRANK => But their pleasure was my pain.
FRANK => Terrible pain.  Appalling ...
JULIA => And the blood let you out?
FRANK => There are ways to resurrection. Blood's one of them.  I won't let them take me back, Julia.
FRANK => I want to be whole, and then get out -
JULIA => You won't have to.  We'll be gone.  Somewhere they'll never find us.
LARRY => Is this upsetting you?
JULIA => I've seen worse.
LARRY => Are you all right?
JULIA => Fine.
LARRY => Only I'll turn it off -
COMMENTATOR => And he's down!  He's down!
COMMENTATOR => - and now he's in trouble, he's really in trouble -
LARRY => What was that?
JULIA => Thunder.
LARRY => No.  Something else.
JULIA => Maybe I left a window open -
LARRY => No.  I'll do it.
JULIA => It was nothing.
LARRY => What's wrong with you?
JULIA => I just hate the thunder.
LARRY => I'm here.
LARRY => Oh baby.
JULIA => Don't go upstairs.
LARRY => Come with me then.
JULIA => Please ...
JULIA => Don't.
LARRY => We must have rats.
LARRY => See?  Quite safe.
LARRY => ... oh babe ...
LARRY => ...I love you, honey ... let me ... oh God ... I love you ...
LARRY => Oh baby ... I love you ...
JULIA => ... no ...
JULIA => No.  No, you mustn't.  PLEASE. No.
LARRY =>  Huh?
JULIA => Please ...
LARRY => What's wrong with you?
JULIA =>  Please.  I can't bear it ...
LARRY => I don't understand you.  One moment you're all over me, the next it's:  Don't touch me.
LARRY => ... maybe we should never have come back.
KIRSTY => Maybe you should give it some time.
LARRY => I guess.
KIRSTY =>  She's not like Mom.  She's ... I don't know ... moody.  I thought that was what you liked about her.
LARRY => You don't like her at all do you?
KIRSTY => I don't know her.  She's so ... sealed up.
LARRY => She doesn't even want to leave the house.
KIRSTY => Really?
LARRY => It's like she's waiting for something.
KIRSTY => What?
LARRY => I don't know.  I don't know. It's beyond me.
LARRY =>  Would you ... maybe call round sometime?  Try to make friends.
KIRSTY => Sure.
LARRY => Maybe all she needs is some company.
FRANK => You can't love him.
JULIA => I don't.
FRANK => So where's the harm?
JULIA => I said no.
FRANK => Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
SYKES => I get lonely sometimes.
JULIA => Everybody does.
JULIA => Come in.
SYKES => What is this?  A game?
SYKES => Christ help me!
SYKES =>  Don't!
SYKES => No!
FRANK =>  Get out of here.
SYKES =>  Please ... don't let him kill me ... please ...
KIRSTY => Oh my God.
KIRSTY =>  Julia!
FRANK => Kirsty?
KIRSTY => Keep your fucking distance. Julia!  Where's Julia?  Christ, what have you done with her.
FRANK => Kirsty.  It's Frank.  It's Uncle Frank.
KIRSTY => No.
FRANK => You remember.
KIRSTY => No.
FRANK => Come to Daddy.
KIRSTY => No.  Get the fuck off me.
FRANK => You've grown.  You're beautiful.
KIRSTY => Don't touch me.  Or so help me -
FRANK => What?  What will you do?  What can you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
FRANK => I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you?  Beautiful.
KIRSTY => This isn't happening.
FRANK => I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain.  But why kid yourself?  Some things have to be endured.  Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter ...
FRANK => Give that to me.
KIRSTY =>  No.
FRANK => One last time.  Give me the box.
KIRSTY => You want it?
FRANK => NO!
VOICE => Are you all right?
WOMAN => Do you need any help?
FRANK => Come to Daddy.
KIRSTY => This isn't happening.
FRANK => Some things have to be endured ...
NURSE => You're awake.
DOCTOR =>  So ... you're back with us.
KIRSTY => I think so.
DOCTOR => How are you feeling?
KIRSTY => Tender.
DOCTOR => You took quite a beating.  Do you remember what happened?
KIRSTY => I want to speak to my father ...
DOCTOR =>  Of course.  We'll bring you a telephone.
KIRSTY => Why not?
DOCTOR => Chin up.  There's no serious damage.  And you're safe here.
KIRSTY => Um.
JULIA => She'll tell them everything ...
FRANK => I don't think so.  She'll want Larry first.
JULIA => That's probably her now.  Or the police.
FRANK => Maybe.
JULIA => Don't you care?
FRANK => There's very little I can do about it.
JULIA => Maybe we should just leave -
FRANK => Like this?  Look at me! LIKE THIS?
JULIA => Well we can't just stay here -
FRANK => I need a skin.  Then we leave -
NURSE => Comfortable?
KIRSTY =>  Sure.
NURSE => Any luck with your father?
KIRSTY =>  He's probably got a meeting. I called a friend of mine.  He's coming; is that O.K.?
NURSE => Of course.
LARRY =>  Julia?
LARRY => What's wrong?
JULIA => I don't know where to begin ...
LARRY => What are you talking about?
JULIA => It's better you see for your- self -
KIRSTY => Where the hell did you come from?
CENOBITE => The box ... you opened it. We came.
KIRSTY => It's just a puzzle box.
CENOBITE => It's a means to summon us - it's called the Lament Con- figuration.
KIRSTY => Who are you?
CENOBITE => Cenobites.  Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some.  Angels to others.
KIRSTY => Well, I didn't mean to open that thing.  You can go back wherever you came from.
FEMALE CENOBITE => We can't.   Not alone.
KIRSTY => This isn't for real.
CENOBITE => You solved the box.  We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
KIRSTY => Don't touch me!
KIRSTY => Steve.  Thank God you came.
STEVE => What happened to you?
KIRSTY => These THINGS ... they want to take me -
STEVE => What things?
CENOBITE =>  He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty.  And you to us.
KIRSTY => No!
STEVE => What's wrong?
KIRSTY => Don't let them take me, Steve -
STEVE => I won't let anybody take you.
FEMALE CENOBITE => If he takes another step, we open his throat.
KIRSTY =>  Please go, Steve.
STEVE => What?
KIRSTY => Just go.  PLEASE.  I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad.  He'll look after me -
STEVE =>  What did I say?
KIRSTY => Will you GO, damn you?
STEVE => I'll come back later, huh?
KIRSTY => Sure.  Why not?
STEVE => 'Bye.
KIRSTY => 'Bye.
FEMALE CENOBITE => Good.
CENOBITE => It's time we were away.
KIRSTY =>  Let me alone, will you?
CENOBITE => No tears please.  It's a waste of good suffering.
KIRSTY => Wait!
CENOBITE => No time for argument.
KIRSTY => You did this before, right?
CENOBITE => Many times.
KIRSTY => To a man called Frank Cotton?
FEMALE CENOBITE => Oh yes.
KIRSTY => But he escaped you.
CENOBITE => Nobody escapes us.
KIRSTY => HE did.  I've seen him.  He's alive.
CENOBITE => Is that so?   And what are you proposing?
KIRSTY => I'll take you to him.  Then you take him instead of me.  Back wherever you come from.
CENOBITE => Perhaps ...
FEMALE CENOBITE => But if you cheat us ...
CENOBITE => We'll tear your soul apart!
STEVE => She was trembling all over.
NURSE => I'd better go look for her.
STEVE => Maybe she's gone back to her -
STEVE => - father.
KIRSTY => Please!   Dad!   It's me! It's Kirsty!
JULIA => Damn her.
VOICE => Answer it.
KIRSTY => Please, answer me!  Please -
JULIA => Kirsty?   It's very late.
KIRSTY => Where's Daddy?
JULIA => What's the problem?
KIRSTY =>  I have to see my father.
JULIA => Of course.  There's no need to shout.
JULIA => You look terrible.  Have you had an accident?
KIRSTY => I was here this afternoon.
JULIA => This afternoon.
KIRSTY => I saw everything.
JULIA => I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
KIRSTY => Oh God.  Thank God.  I thought something might have ...
LARRY => Of course.
LARRY => It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right ...
KIRSTY => No.  You don't understand. Your brother - Frank - he's here in the house.  And he's -
LARRY => Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
KIRSTY => Finished?
LARRY =>  He's gone.
KIRSTY => Gone?
JULIA => Dead.
LARRY => He was insane, baby:  a mad dog. I put him out of his misery -
CENOBITE => ... we'll tear your soul apart ...
LARRY => I'll go to the police, when I'm feeling stronger.  Try and find some way to make them understand, though God knows I don't really understand myself.  Did he hurt you?
LARRY =>  Poor Frank.  He's better off dead.
KIRSTY => I don't believe it.
LARRY => I'm afraid it's true.
KIRSTY =>  I want to see.
LARRY => No you don't.
KIRSTY => Yes!
LARRY =>  Show her.
