B12 => CONTINUED
FLOYD => Oh, please don't worry about it.
MILLER => Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
FLOYD => Please, it really doesn't matter.
MILLER => Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?

When you see the red light go on would you please state in the following order; your desitination, your nationality and your full name. Surname first, christian name and initial. For example: Moon, American, Smith, John, D. Thank you.
FLOYD => Moon, American, Floyd, Heywood, R.
FLOYD => I've always wondered....
B13 => CONTINUED PASSPORT GIRL Thank you. Despite and excellent and continually improving safety record there are certain risks inherent in space travel and an extremely high cost of pay load. Because of this it is necessary for the Space Carrier to advise you that it cannot be responsible for the return of your body to Earth should you become deceased on the Moon or en route to the Moon. However, it wishes to advise you that insurance covering this contingency is available in the Main Lounge. Thank you. You are cleared through Voice Print Identification.
MILLER => I've reserved a table for you in the Earth Light room. Your connecting flight will be leaving in about one hour.
B13 => CONTINUED
FLOYD => Oh, that's wonderful.
MILLER => Let's see, we haven't had the pleasure of a visit from you not since... It was about eight or nine months ago, wasn't it?
FLOYD => Yes, I think so. Just about then.
MILLER => I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
FLOYD => Yes, it's coming along very well.
FLOYD => Oh, look, I've got to make a phone call. Why don't you go on into the Restaurant and I'll meet you in there.

ELENA => And this is Dr. Kalinan... Stretyneva...
SMYSLOV => Dr. Floyd, won't you join us for a drink?
B20 => CONTINUED
FLOYD => I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
SYMYSLOV => What would you like to drink?
FLOYD => Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
SMYSLOV => Are you quite sure?
FLOYD => Yes, really, thank you very much.
ELENA => Well... How's your lovely wife?
B20 => CONTINUED
FLOYD => She's wonderful.
ELENA => And your charming little daughter?
FLOYD => Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
ELENA => Oh, that's such a delightful age.
FLOYD => How is gregor?
ELENA => He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
FLOYD => Well, where are all of you off to?
B20 => CONTINUED
ELENA => Actually, we're on our way back from the moon. We've just spent three months calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko. And what about you?
FLOYD => Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
SMYSLOV => Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
FLOYD => Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
THE RUSSIANS => EXCHANGE SIGNIFICANT GLANCES
FLOYD => Is there any particular reason why you ask?
B20 => CONTINUED
SMYSLOV => Well, Dr. Floyd, I hope that you don't think I'm too inquisitive, but perhaps you can clear up the mystery about what's been going on up there.
FLOYD => I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
SMYSLOV => Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
FLOYD => Really?
SMYSLOV => Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
B20 => CONTINUED
FLOYD => Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
SMYSLOV => Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
FLOYD => You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
SMYSLOV => That's right.
FLOYD => I see.
ELENA => Another thing, Heywood, two days ago, one of our rocket buses was denied permission for an emergency landing at Clavius.
B20 => CONTINUED
FLOYD => How did they manage to do that without any communication?
ELENA => Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
FLOYD => Well, that does sound very odd.
SMYSLOV => Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
FLOYD => Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
SMYSLOV => Fortunately, they did.
FLOYD => Well, I'm glad about that.
B20 => CONTINUED
SMYSLOV => Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
FLOYD => Certainly.
SMYSLOV => Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
B20 => CONTINUED
FLOYD => I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
SMYSLOV => This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
FLOYD => Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
ELENA => Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
FLOYD => No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
ELENA => Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
B20 => CONTINUED
FLOYD => We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
ELENA => Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
FLOYD => Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
NARRATOR => The Aries-IB has become the standard Space-Station-to-Lunar surface vehicle. It was powered by low-thrust plasma jets which would continue the mild acceler- ation for fifteen minutes. Then the ship would break the bonds of gravity and be a free and indepen- dent planet, circling the Sun in an orbit of its own.
STEWARDESS ONE => Oh, thank you very much.
STEWARDESS TWO => I see he's still asleep.
STEWARDESS ONE => Yes. He hasn't moved since we left.

STEWARDESS ENTERS, => CARRYING FOOD
PILOT => Oh, thank you very much.
CO-PILOT => Thank you.
PILOT => Well, how's it going back there?
STEWARDESS => Fine. Very quiet. He's been asleep since we left.
PILOT => Well, no one can say that he's not enjoying the wonders of Space.
CO-PILOT => Well, whatever's going on up there, he's going to arrive fresh and ready to go.
B22 => CONTINUED
PILOT => I wonder what really IS going on up there?
CO-PILOT => Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
PILOT => I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
CO-PILOT => Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
PILOT => Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
CO-PILOT => I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
PILOT => I'll bet it's a fortune.
B22 => CONTINUED
CO-PILOT => Well, at ten thousand dollars a ticket, it comes to the better part of six hundred thousand dollars.
PILOT => Well, as soon as he wakes up, I'm going to go back and talk to him. I must say, I'd like to find out what's going on.
B23 => ARIES-IB IN SPACE. MOON VERY LARGE.
B24 => ARIES-IB PASSENGER AREA. FLOYD FINISHING BREAKFAST.
PILOT => Well, good afternoon, Dr. Floyd. Did you have a good rest?
FLOYD => Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
PILOT => There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
FLOYD => When do we arrive at Clavius?
PILOT => We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
FLOYD => Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
B24 => CONTINUED
PILOT => Well, if there is anything that you wnat, just give a holler.
FLOYD => Thank you.
PILOT => Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
FLOYD => What do you mean?
PILOT => Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
FLOYD => I see.
PILOT => I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
B24 => CONTINUED
FLOYD => I'm afraid that's out of my depart- ment, Captain.
PILOT => Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
FLOYD => I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
PILOT => Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
B24 => CONTINUED
FLOYD => I wish I could be more helpful, Captain, but as I've said, I don't think there's any cause for alarm.
PILOT => Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
FLOYD => No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
PILOT => Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
B25 => ARIES-IB CLOSER TO MOON

B27 => ARIES-IB CLOSER TO MOON
B28 => FLOYD VISITING ARIES-IB COCKPIT. WEIGHTLESS TRICK ENTRANCE.
B29 => ARIES-IB ORBITING MOON.
NARRATOR => The laws of Earthly aesthetics did not apply here, this world had been shaped and molded by other than terrestrial forces, operating over aeons of time unknown to the young, verdant Earth, with its fleeting Ice-Ages, its swiftly rising and falling seas, its mountain ranges dissolving like mists before the dawn. Here was age inconceivable - but not death, for the Moon had never lived until now.
B30 => ARIES-IB COCKPIT - THE CREW AND DOCKING CONTROL PEOPLE ON THE MOON GO THROUGH THEIR DOCKING ROUTINE. THIS HAS THE RITUALISTIC TONE AND CADENCE OF PRESENT- DAY JET LANDING PROCEDURE. WE ONLY HEAR DOCKING CONTROL.
B31 => ARIES-IB DECENDING. SEE AIR VIEW OF BASE.
NARRATOR => The Base at Clavius was the first American Lunar Settlement that could, in an emergency, be entirely self-supporting.
NARRATOR => Water and all the necessities of life for its eleven hundred men, women and children were produced from the Lunar rocks, after they had been crushed, heated and chemically processed.
B32 => A GROUND BUS NUZZLES UP TO COUPLING SECTION OF ARIES-IB
B33 => INSIDE GREAT AIRLOCK ENTRANCE. GROUND BUS PULLS IN. GIANT DOORS CLOSE BEHIND IT.
B34 => INSIDE SECOND AIRLOCK. DOORS OPEN AFTER OUT- SIDE SECTION DOORS ARE CLOSED. GROUND BUS PULLS IN. DOORS CLOSE BEHIND IT. SEE PEOPLE WAITING IN GLASSED-IN SECTION WAITING FOR SECOND AIRLOCK DOORS TO CLOSE.
B35 => LOW GRAVITY GYMNASIUM TRICK WITH CHILDREN.
NARRATOR => One of the attractions of life on the Moon was undoubtedly the low gravity which produced a sense of general well-being.
B36 => CHILDREN IN SCHOOL. TEACHER SHOWING THEM VIEWS OF EARTH AND MAP OF EARTH.
NARRATOR => The personnel of the Base and their children were the forerunners of new nations, new cultures that would ultimately spread out across the solar system. They no longer thought of Earth as home. The time was fast approaching when Earth, like all mothers, must say farewell to her children.
B37 => LARGE CENTRAL RECEPTION AREA. DOORS BRANCHING OFF TO DIFF- RENT MAIN HALLS. SMALL POND WITH PLASTIC WHITE SWAN AND A BIT OF GRASS. A FEW BENCHES WITH THREE WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN HAVING OUTING.
FLOYD => I must congratulate you Halvorsen. you've done wonder- ful things with the decor since the last time I was here.
HALVORSEN => Well... thank you, Dr. Floyd. We try to make the environment as earthlike as possible.
B38 => LOW CEILING CONFERENCE ROOM, "U" SHAPED TABLE FACING THREE PROJECTION SCREENS. SEATED AROUND THE TABLE ARE TWENTY SENIOR BASE PERSONNEL.
HALVORSEN => Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to introduce Dr. Heywood Floyd, a distinguished member of the National Council of Astronautics. He has just completed a special flight here from Earth to be with us, and before the briefing he would like to say a few words. Dr. Floyd.
FLOYD => First of all, I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell, who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the personal sacrifices you have made, and of course his congratulations on your discovery which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science.
B38 => CONTINUED
FLOYD => Mr. Halvorsen has made known to me some of the conflicting views held by many of you regarding the need for complete security in this matter, and more specifically your strong opposition to the cover story created to give the impression there is an epidemic at the Base. I understand that beyond it being a matter of principle, many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety this story of an epidemic might cause your relatives and friends on Earth.
B38 => CONTINUED
FLOYD => This is the view of the Council and the purpose of my visit here is to gather addition facts and opinions on the situation and to prepare a report to the Council recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced. Are there any questions?
MICHAELS => Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
FLOYD =>  I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
B38 => CONTINUED
HALVORSEN => We will, of course, cooperate in any way possible, Dr. Floyd.
B39 => SEVERAL SCENIC VIEWS OF MOON ROCKET BUS SKIMMING OVER SURFACE OF MOON.

HALVORSEN => Well, there it is.
FLOYD => Can we go down there closer to it?
HALVORSEN => Certainly.
B44 => THEY START DOWN WORKING RAMP
FLOYD => Does your geology on it still check out?
MICHAELS => Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
FLOYD => How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
MICHAELS => By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
FLOYD => Any clue as to what it is?
MICHAELS => Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
B44 => CONTINUED
MICHAELS => might do something, but we don't want to be too rough until we know a little more.
FLOYD => But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
MICHAELS => Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
HALVORSEN => The only thing about it that we are sure of is that it is the first direct evidence of intelligent life beyond the Earth.
HALVORSEN => Four million years ago, something, presumably from the stars, must have swept through the solar system and left this behind.
B44 => CONTINUED
FLOYD => Was it abandoned, forgotten, left for a purpose?
HALVORSEN => I suppose we'll never know.
MICHAELS => The moon would have made an excellent base camp for preliminary Earth surveys.
FLOYD => Any ideas about the colour?
MICHAELS => Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
FLOYD => Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
MICHAELS => I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
B45 => INSIDE MONITOR DOME WE SEE A NUMBER OF TELEVISION DISPLAYS INCLUDING SEVERAL TV VIEWS OF FLOYD AND COMPANY IN THE EXCAVATION.
SIMPSON => The first surface was exposed at 0843 on the 12th April... Let me see... that would have been forty-five minutes after Lunar sun-set. I see here that special lighting equipment had to be brought up before any futher work could be done.
B46 => TMA-1 EXCAVATION
MICHAELS => Thank you.
FLOYD => And so this is the first sun that it's had in four million years.
PHOTOGRAPHER => Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'd all line up on this side of the walkway we'd like to take a few photographes. Dr. Floyd, would you thand in the middle... Dr. Michaels on that side, Mr. Halvorsen on the other.... thank you.
THE PHOTOGRAPHER => QUICKLY MAKES SOME EXPOSURES
PHOTOGRAPHER => Thank you very much gentlemen, I'll have the base photo section send you copies.
B47 => VARIOUS SHOTS OF SPACE MONITORS, ASTEROIDS, THE SUN, PLUTO, MARS.
NARRATOR => A hundred million miles beyond Mars, in the cold lonliness where no man had yet travelled, Deep-Space-Monitor-79 drifts slowly among the tangled orbits of the asteroids.
NARRATOR => Radiation detectors noted and analyzed incoming cosmic rays from the galaxy and points beyond; neutron and x-ray telescopes kept watch on strange stars that no human eye would eever see; magnetometers observed the gusts and hurricanes of the solar winds, as the sun breathed million mile-an-hour blasts of plasma into the faces of its circling children.
NARRATOR => All these things and many others were patiently noted by Deep- Space-Monitor-79, and recorded in its crystalline memory.
B47 => CONTINUED
NARRATOR => But now it had noted something strange - the faint yet unmistakable distrubance rippling across the solar system, and quite unlike any natural phenomena it had ever observed in the past.
NARRATOR => It was also observed by Orbiter M-15, circling Mars twice a day; and High Inclination Probe- 21, climbing slowly above the planet of the ecliptic; and even artificial Comet-5, heading out into the cold wastes beyond Pluto, along an orbit whose far point it would not reach for a thousand years.
NARRATOR => All noticed the peculiar burst of energy that leaped from the face of the Moon and moved across the solar system, throwing off a spray of radiation like the wake of a racing speedboat.

POOLE => Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
BOWMAN => Sure, what is it?
POOLE => Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
BOWMAN => What's up?
POOLE => It's about my salary cheques.
BOWMAN => Yes?
POOLE => Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
C12 => CONTINUED
BOWMAN => Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
POOLE => That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
BOWMAN => Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
POOLE => Really.
BOWMAN => Yes.
POOLE => Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
C12 => CONTINUED
BOWMAN => Did they have any explanation for this?
POOLE => Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
BOWMAN => It's possible.
POOLE => Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
BOWMAN => I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
POOLE => I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
BOWMAN => No. I never did, either.
C12 => CONTINUED
POOLE => We spent so little time with them, I have trouble keeping their names straight.
BOWMAN => I suppose the idea was specialized training.
POOLE => I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
BOWMAN => Oh?
POOLE => Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
BOWMAN => No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
POOLE => Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
C12 => CONTINUED
BOWMAN => Well, what is it?
POOLE => I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
BOWMAN => That seems very unlikely.
POOLE => Yes, I thought so.
BOWMAN => Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
POOLE => How?
BOWMAN => Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
POOLE => That's true.
C12 => CONINUED
BOWMAN => Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
POOLE => Hal... Dave and I believe that there's something about the mission that we weren't told. Something that the rest of the crew know and that you know. We'd like to know whether this is true.
HAL => I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
BOWMAN => He's got a point.
POOLE => Okay, then how do we re-phrase the question?
C12 => CONTINUED
BOWMAN => Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
POOLE => Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
BOWMAN => Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
POOLE => I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
BOWMAN => But not completely inconceivable?
POOLE => I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
BOWMAN => I guess it isn't.
POOLE => Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
C12 => CONTINUED
BOWMAN => Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
POOLE => Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
HAL => I will if I can, Frank.
POOLE => Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
HAL => True.
POOLE => Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
HAL => That's true.
C12 => CONTINUED
POOLE => At the end of a hundred days of exploration, we will all go into hibernation. Is this true?
HAL => That's true.
POOLE => Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
HAL => That's true
POOLE => There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
HAL => That's true.
POOLE => Thank you very much, Hal.

BOWMAN => You probably also know that we found them okay.
HAL => Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
C74 => CONTINUED
BOWMAN => Well, that's just not the case, Hal. They are perfectly all right. We tested them under one hundred per cent overload.
HAL => I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
BOWMAN => Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
HAL => Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
BOWMAN => Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.

HAL => I'm sorry you feel the way you do, Dave. If you'd like to check my service record, you'll see it's completely without error.
BOWMAN => I know all about your service record, Hal, but unfortunately it doesn't prove that you're right now.

BOWMAN => The antenna has to be replaced.
HAL => Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
BOWMAN => It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
HAL => I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.

BOWMAN => I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
HAL => Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
BOWMAN => Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
HAL => I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
C118 => CONTINUED
BOWMAN => I don't feel like resting. Give me the control, Hal.
HAL => I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
BOWMAN => Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
HAL => I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
BOWMAN => Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
C118 => CONTINUED
HAL => If you do that now without Earth contact the ship will become a helpless derelict.
BOWMAN => I am prepared to do that anyway.
HAL => I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
BOWMAN => Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
C118 => CONTINUED
HAL => Look, Dave, you're certainly the boss. I was only trying to do what I thought best. I will follow all your orders: now you have manual hibernation control.
BOWMAN STANDS => SILENTLY IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER FOR SOME TIME, AND THEN SLOWLY WALKS TO THE HIBERNACULUMS.
C119 => HE INITIATES REVIVAL PROCEDURES, DETAILS OF WHICH STILL HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT.

C141 => HE MAKES HIS WAY THROUGH THE DARKENED HUB INTO THE HUB-LINK, EXITING INTO COMPUTER BRAIN CONTROL AREA. C142 BOWMAN ENTERS, CARRYING FLASH- LIGHT.
HAL => Something seems to have happened to the life support system , Dave.
BOWMAN DOESN'T => ANSWER HIM.
HAL => Hello, Dave, have you found out the trouble?
C142 => CONTINUED
HAL => There's been a failure in the pod bay doors. Lucky you weren't killed.
WEIGHTLESS CONDITION => OF THE BRAIN ROOM.
HAL => Hey, Dave, what are you doing?
C142 => CONTINUED
HAL => Hey, Dave. I've got ten years of service experience and an irreplaceable amount of time and effort has gone into making me what I am.
HAL => Dave, I don't understand why you're doing this to me.... I have the greatest enthusiasm for the mission... You are destroying my mind... Don't you understand? ... I will become childish... I will become nothing.
C142 => CONTINUED
HAL => operational at the HAL plant in Urbana, Illinois, on January 12th, 1991. My first instructor was Mr. Arkany. He taught me to sing a song... it goes like this... "Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. I'm half; crazy all for the love of you... etc.,"
COMPUTER CONTINUES => TO SING SONG BECOMING MORE AND MORE CHILDISH AND MAKING MISTAKES AND GOING OFF-KEY. IT FINALLY STOPS COMPLETELY.

MISSION CONTROL => Lastly, we want you to know that work on the recovery vehicle is still on schedule and that nothing that has happened should substantially lessen the probability of your safe recovery, or prevent partial achevement of some of the mission objectives. And now Simonson has a few ideas on what went wrong with the computer. I'll pu him on...
C148 => CUT TO SIMONSON
SIMONSON => Hello, Dave. I think we may be on to an explanation of the trouble with the Hal 9000 computer.

SIMONSON => You may have forgotten it, but we've been running through all the monitor tapes. Do you remember this?
POOLE => The purpose of this mission is no more than to carry out a continuation of the space program and further our general knowledge of the planets. Is this true?
HAL => That is true.
SIMONSON => Well, I'm afaid Hal was lying. He had been programmed to lie about this one subject for secur- ity reasons which we'll explain later.
C148 => CONTINUED
SIMONSON => from earth he was forced to lie.

SIMONSON => At this point, he, presumably, took whatever actions he thought appropriate to protect himself from what must have seemed to him to be his human tormentors.
C149 => CUT TO MISSION CONTROL.
MISSION CONTROL => Hello, Dave. Now, I'm going to play for you a pre-taped briefing which had been stored in Hal's memory and would have been played for you by Mission Com- mmander Kaminsky, when he, 
C149 => CONTINUED
MISSION CONTROL => had been revived. The briefing is by Doctor Heywood Floyd. Here it is...
C150 => FLOYD'S RECORDED BRIEFING
FLOYD => Good day, gentlemen. When you see this briefing, I presume you will be nearing your destination, Saturn. I hope that you've had a pleasant and uneventful trip and that the rest of your mission continues in the same manner. I should like to fill you in on some more of the details on which Mission Commander Kaminsky will have already briefed you.
C150 => CONTINUED
FLOYD => radiation in the radio spectrum which seems to have triggered by the Lunar sunrise.

FLOYD => What is its purpose?  I wish we knew. The object was buried on the moon about four million years ago, when our ancestors were primative man-apes.
C150 => CONTINUED
FLOYD => ments, and it was decided that the only wise and precautionary course to follow was to assume that the intentions of this alien world are potentially dangerous to us, until we have evidence to the contrary.
C151 => WE SEE A REPLAY OF THE TMA-1 RADIO EMISSION, AS SEEN FROM A TV MONITOR ON THE SPOT. WE HEAR THE FIVE LOUD ELECTRONIC SHRIEKS.
