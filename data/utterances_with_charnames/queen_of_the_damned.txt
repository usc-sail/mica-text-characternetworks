VOICE => There comes a time for every vampire when the idea of eternity becomes momentarily unbearable...
VOICE => The wounds suffered from love and failed friendships don't heal like a human's, but seem to only gape larger. The longing to be mortal returns, a longing for finiteness.
VOICE => In 1883 I suffered such a spell and decided to cease feeding on blood. Just lie in the earth and let time return to its natural state...
VOICE => I had hoped the sounds of the passing eras would fade out, and a kind of death might happen. A kind of forgetting where I would be healed from my wounds.
VOICE => But as I lay there, the sounds didn't fade but grew with the world.
VOICE => And gradually the world didn't sound like the place I had left, but something different... better...
VOICE => A new fearless attitude had possessed the world, brave and Godless. I began to wonder if it was not time to resurrect. But the thing that eventually brought me back -- the decisive thing really -- came like a bolt out of the blue.
VOICE => A music so sublime, so deeply vampiric, I had no doubt it could be heard in Hades. I had no choice... it summoned me.
VOICE #2 =>  Need a fix?
LESTAT => Whether it was that first meal, the music, or the 100 years of rest, I'm not sure, but suddenly I was feeling better than ever. My appetite for living was voracious. My hearing so exact I could locate precisely the source of the music...
LESTAT => My old house.
LESTAT => It was hard to believe these beings were mortal -- so confident in their skin. Everything in my body wanted to be with them. I couldn't help myself.
ALEX => What the hell, Maudy.
LESTAT => Please don't stop.
JAMES => What the f-- How did you get in here?
LESTAT => The door, of course.
LESTAT => Your music woke me from the longest sleep. It's sublime. In two hundred years I've never heard anything quite like it.
ALEX => Who the hell are you?
LESTAT => The question provoked an irresistible urge...
LESTAT => You may call me the vampire Lestat.
LESTAT => It just rolled out of my mouth. With one simple sentence I had betrayed everything about my kind. Betrayed our code of secrecy.
LESTAT => Your struggles are over.
LESTAT => All that you've ever dreamed of will be yours.
ALEX =>  What the hell is this?
LESTAT => Your lucky day.
JAMES => Cool.   We got our very own vampire.
MAUDY => Hey, Vampire Lestat, I've always wondered... about Keith Richards...
voice. => 
LESTAT => It was a bold move, I admit. But from that moment on, they were my friends, my children, my band. Together we rode on the wave of my preternatural ambition to superstardom, giving the world a new god... me.
FANS => Lestat!    Lestat!
ROGER => May I present the Vampire Lestat.
LESTAT => Good evening. I'm so sorry I'm late. I was just having my... breakfast.
JOURNALIST => Excellent makeup job.   Marilyn Manson, look out...
ROGER => Hey, hey! We're gonna keep this short here! One at a time. You!
LESTAT => Yes. But why hide it in this day and age? I've hidden in the shadows for centuries. It's time to share myself with the world.
MUSIC JOURNALIST => And it doesn't hurt the record sales, huh? Your album just topped all kinds of sales records.
LESTAT => Our label isn't complaining, no.
LESTAT => If you like, I'll give you a private demonstration in your hotel room tonight.
LIFESTYLE JOURNALIST => Why not a demo at your own house? I mean, what's with all the secrecy about where you stay? Is it true you move residences every few days?
LESTAT =>  After calling one stone tomb home sweet home for so long, I like to experience as much diversity as I can. Wouldn't you?
MUSIC JOURNALIST => There are a lot of rumors flying around the internet about the hidden meaning in your lyrics, that you're giving away 'vampire secrets.' Something in all that?
LESTAT => Maybe I'm trying to resurrect a few old friends with my words. Daring them to come out.
MUSIC JOURNALIST => Of the closet.
LESTAT =>  The casket...
MUSIC JOURNALIST => Your first and only concert's in Death Valley, just days away. Why just the one?
LESTAT =>  I don't like repeating myself.
MUSIC JOURNALIST => But these other vampires, aren't they going to be pissed that you're giving away their secrets?
LESTAT => I imagine they are, yes.
LIFESTYLE JOURNALIST => Do you have anything to say to the other vampires listening out there?
LESTAT => Yes, as a matter of fact, I do...
LESTAT => Come out, come out, wherever you are.
VAMPIRE #1 => Goddamn fool's going to bring back the Inquisition.
VAMPIRE #2 => I say we kill him, before this gets out of hand. Bleed him dry.
VAMPIRE #1 => Gotta find him first. Elusive bloke. Never know where he's going to turn up.
VAMPIRE #2 => Well we know one place he's definitely going to be...
VAMPIRE #1 => When I was in Manchester, the coven there was saying exactly the same thing. That we should nail him at the concert...
VAMPIRE #1 => Yes. Well let's see how he handles a thousand of us at once.
LESTAT => See you all in Death Valley.
LESTAT =>  Come out, come out, whoever you are.
VAMPIRE => Ah, Jesse. You want to come and play with us, don't you?
WOMAN =>  Jesse!
VAMPIRE => Soon, soon, little one. I'll make sure you're with us forever.
WOMAN =>  Jesse!
JESSE => No!
JESSE => I have reason to believe Lestat's the real thing. A vampire. And an ancient one.
TALAMASCAN #1 => I don't know, Jesse. It looks to me like the guy's got a good P.R. man with a flair for the theatrical.
JESSE =>  It would appear that way. But have you listened to his songs? Read his lyrics?
JESSE => Well,i have. In one of his songs he refers to a pub called the Sailor's Arms. I think it's a clue...
JESSE =>  'Where are you now? Back in the sailor's arms, somewhere in the back streets of Soho?' I tracked down the old leases in London. It turns out, in the late 1700's, there was a pub right in the backstreets of Soho called the Sailor's Arms.
JESSE => And it had a reputation for dealing with black magic. Witches' covens, seances, that sort of thing.
JESSE => And most importantly, reports of people being lured there and subsequently attacked by bloodsucking fiends.
JESSE => Here's where you could find the Sailor's Arms in old London.
JESSE => And here is where it would be today. Of course the Sailor's Arms is not there anymore. That part of London is mostly old warehouses, meat-packing plants.
TALAMASCAN #2 => In a few years it will be artists' lofts and pretentious French cafes...
JESSE => Yes, but right now there's only one place to get a drink -- of sorts. A private club -- in exactly the same place. The Waverly Arms.
JESSE => Well, what happens at the Waverly Arms now makes the Sailor's Arms look like a Happy Meal at McDonald's.
JESSE => It's a vampire coven. And Lestat's leading us to it.
TALAMASCAN #1 =>  And what makes you think so?
TALAMASCAN #2 => Jesse, can you, uh, focus that any better?
JESSE =>  Well... it was taken... while...  ... in motion.
JESSE =>  But listen, if you look closely, you can see they're vampires. I'm sure of it. And Lestat's leading us to them and --
TALAMASCAN #3 =>  Interesting. Perhaps we should assign someone to observe --
TALAMASCAN #1 => Oh please, based on this so-called 'data'? That's a waste of time.
JESSE => But... uh...
TALAMASCAN #2 =>  Wait a second. Who took this picture?
JESSE =>  I did.
TALAMASCAN #2 => You went there?
JESSE => Yes.   Last night.
TALAMASCAN #1 => And who gave you this directive?
JESSE => No one.  I... just... went.  Look, I know it was breaking protocol and I'm really sorry, it's just I think --
TALAMASCAN #1 => Jesse! You're just an apprentice here! You must follow our rules... Or perhaps we need to reconsider your position.
TALAMASCAN #3 => For 12 centuries our mission as Talamascans has been to observe and record paranormal behavior. But never get involved. You're getting far too close.
JESSE =>  Hey, does it look like I got involved? That is not called involvement. That is called running.
TALAMASCAN #2 =>  But, Jesse, tell us, what did you see?
JESSE => Vampires.   Gathering.   I'm sure of it.
JESSE => You have to listen to Lestat's lyrics. They're amazing. 
JESSE => Many of the references could only be derived from years of research in the Bibliotech de Paris, which seems unlikely for a young rock star in his early twenties. Plus there are historical details dating back hundreds of years Lestat describes that don't exist anywhere... except in our library. He refers to Marius, the great white lord, who ruled over a group of islands off the Bay of Naples in the late 18th Century. What I'm trying to say here, and maybe I'm not doing the best job of it, is that Lestat may be the oldest and most powerful vampire ever documented!
TALAMASCAN #1 => It doesn't make any sense. Why would he be forecasting this to the world? He's all but drawn a map and marked an X. What vampires hold sacred is keeping their kind a secret. You never name other immortals, tell where their lairs are. They'd be hunted down.
JESSE => Right. That's the best part. Lestat's not afraid to piss them off. He wants mortals and immortals to know he's there, to know he exists. I don't know why... (glancing at skeptical Talamascan #1) But this has never happened before. Don't you see? He's a one man revolution.
TALAMASCAN #1 => And this photo is your evidence? It's hardly conclusive.  C'mon. It looks like the Blair witch!
JESSE => Fine. Well then, I guess I'll just have to go back and get better, more conclusive evidence! Maybe you just can't unravel all the mysteries of the world out there, by sitting around all day in a dusty old library in here!
TALBOT => Jesse.
TALBOT => My office.   Now.
SLEEK BOUNCER => Okay, you, in. You. No... (smiles at a sexy girl) You in...  You, no.
UNATTRACTIVE GUY => C'mon, man, she's waiting for me in there. She said she was putting me on the list. My name's Norman --
BOUNCER #1 => Yeah, yeah, right. Hey, get a life, alright? (to another sexy girl) You, in.
BOUNCER #1 => Hey, perv, get the hell out of here.
LESTAT => You.   In...
LESTAT =>  You.   No.
ROGER => Yeah, Phil. We'll need a limo from the airport. I don't know which airfield yet... I don't know the arrival time either. 
ROGER =>  Yeah... I'll call you from the plane... Nope, I'll tell the driver where he's taking us... Hey I don't even know myself... pick up address in London?... Forget it... you'd never find this place. Christ we'll probably have changed houses again by then... What can I say, the guy's just...
ROGER =>  -- just uh... shy... that's it... shy.
JAMES => We rock.
LESTAT => Yes, I'd say I'm down with that.
JAMES => I'm ready for Los Angeles...
MAUDY => I'm ready for Death Valley.  Two days till we go...
ALEX => Think we can call that a night.
LESTAT => Oh, the sweet song of her blood.
LESTAT => I'll hear it in my head all night.
LESTAT => Roger...
LESTAT => I didn't know you were religious.
LESTAT => Roger...
LESTAT => Be careful, Roger.   Very careful.
TALBOT => How's everything? You alright? You sleeping okay?
JESSE => Yeah, I'm great. I just found a vampire.
TALBOT =>  Jesse... you're taking this Lestat stuff pretty seriously... why?
JESSE => Cause I think I'm on to something pretty big. The most important sighting Talamasca's had in years...  Jesus, I don't know, David... I thought I was onto something... Maybe I didn't see anything...
TALBOT => You know we work in a really strange field? The supernatural is beguiling at times. It doesn't like to just be observed, it is only satisfied when it has drawn us in completely. I know cause I've felt these things myself. 
TALBOT => That's what we have to resist, as Talamascans... (as a shadow crosses his face) It's not always easy.
JESSE =>  Talbot. C'mon. You know me. I'm not freaking out on you. I'm just onto what looks -- alright looked
JESSE => David. There's nothing else. Nothing is 'beguiling' me, alright? Nothing. C'mon.
TALBOT => Alright.   Just checking...
TALBOT => Well, all I can say is you're really lucky you're not lying dead in a gutter with two holes on your neck.
JESSE => I'd be even luckier if that damn picture came out... (stops in her tracks, turns back, gazes at him, amazed) Wait a second. So you do believe me? You do think it's a vampire coven.
TALBOT =>  Yes. But not exactly for the reasons you think. Though your research is top-notch of course...  Come back here. I'm gonna show you something.
TALBOT => What do you see?
JESSE => They're all nightscapes. The detail is amazing. Mid-1500s. Florence.
TALBOT => Right. And what do you see in this one?
TALBOT => And I know it's a Dutch pastoral.
JESSE => This man is in both.
TALBOT => Right.   He's in all of them.
JESSE => Have you --
TALBOT => Carbon tested? Yes. The different paint samples are all authentic. All painted at the time of that particular style.
TALBOT => It's Marius, Jesse.
JESSE =>  Marius?! From Lestat's lyrics. I knew I was right.
TALBOT => Yes, you were. Good work.
TALBOT => I've been personally tracing him for decades. My little obsession. The oldest vampire ever documented. The closest we've come to the original vampire.
JESSE => What do you mean the original vampire?
TALBOT => There's a Mesopotamian legend that there once was a queen of Egypt, Akasha, long before Tutankhamen or Nefertiti. She was believed to be the original vampire... Marius himself dates back to 400 B.C...
JESSE => David, you've been tracking Marius your whole life. Maybe he's out there waiting for you right now. (without looking at him) Don't you ever want to just go and find him and --
TALBOT => No. Jesus, we are not talking about having a drink at the Dorchester, Jesse. You know that. Especially with the ancient vampires -- the older they are, the more powerful, the more dangerous...
TALBOT => Anyway, you don't need to go and stake out some club. Your time is too valuable. I have something far better for you...
JESSE =>  You do?
TALBOT => Yes. And I'll tell you something. I've never shown this to anyone. No one else has proved themself in the way you have.
JESSE =>  Thanks. What is it?
TALBOT => Oh you're gonna love this.  Although I'm sure it will keep you up nights to come with nightmares...
TALBOT => Lestat's diary. I found it some years ago. This is where you'll find the answers you need.
TALBOT => They don't need to know everything, right?
JESSE => Thank you for this.
TALBOT => My pleasure. When I took you on as an apprentice, I knew it was the smartest thing I'd ever done. Now you and I'll meet when you're done... This will be our project...
JESSE => Je suis le vampire Lestat...  I am the vampire Lestat.
LESTAT => It was the winter of 1788 and I was brought to a Mediterranean Island by the man who made me...
LESTAT => ... if a man is what you'd call him.
MARIUS => Lestat.    Welcome.
LESTAT => Who are you? Do I know you?
MARIUS => I'm unknowable by nature.
MARIUS => But you may call me Marius.
LESTAT => I'm the lord of a great manor. They'll send an army of men to look for me.
MARIUS => I doubt they'll find you, Lord De Lioncourt. You're a long way from home...
MARIUS => You're weak... near passing. I can barely hear your heartbeat.
LESTAT => I'll kill you!
MARIUS => You really do fear nothing. It is why I chose you. Because you think things are possible which aren't possible...
LESTAT => Chose me? For what?
MARIUS => My companion. Someone to share my burden.
MARIUS => You've lost a great deal of blood.
LESTAT =>  I'm dying.
MARIUS => Then drink.
MARIUS => Good, is it not?
MARIUS => Drink and live. You've been brave enough for one night, my son.
MARIUS => Drink... drink and learn.
MARIUS => There... there... that will do.
MARIUS => No... no more.   Lestat, no more!
MARIUS => Don't be afraid, it's only your body that dies...
LESTAT => More!
LESTAT => I impressed my maker with my thirst for things. He set out to educate me in the unknown. Taught me all about the world, its hidden history... and about myself.
MARIUS => That's enough, my son... When you feed, you must hold back from the moment of death. You must never take the last drop, or it will draw you in and you will die...
MARIUS => Remember, there is wisdom in the flesh, Lestat. A man wears his history on his skin...
MARIUS => I'm talking about humanity.
LESTAT => Humanity?  We're murderers.
MARIUS => We're more than that. Their blood that we take into us carries with it life... their life, their knowledge, their complexity. Appreciate your prey, Lestat.
LESTAT => My senses run amok, like a newborn child. And as for my new powers, I was beside myself with the pleasure of it all...
MARIUS => The trick is to find the way to face eternity head on. The spirit can be annihilated by boredom just as the body can be destroyed by sun or fire. My solace, my delight, is witnessing the unfolding of human destiny...
MARIUS => ... From Christ to the Dark Ages to the enlightenment, I've never been able to divine what was coming. That's what keeps me going -- I can't wait to see what human beings are going to do next...
MARIUS => Who could've predicted the Enlightenment? Or Hannibal and his elephants?
MARIUS => Careful.
LESTAT => But why must we hide, Marius? We are the powerful, we are the immortal. We should walk fearless in the open!
MARIUS => Shhh. The life of a vampire is a life of discretion. We must sleep during the day, when we are vulnerable to the sun. Mortals must never know about us. It is forbidden, for the sake of all our kind.
LESTAT =>  So I could never know her?
MARIUS => Not unless you wanted to kill her.
LESTAT =>  So I can never be known?
MARIUS => You're known by me. I granted you that. There are others of our kind... though most are solitary creatures.
LESTAT => My God...
MARIUS => Forget God. You're no longer in his realm. Now we must leave.
FATHER => Fantasma!! Teras!!
MARIUS => Stop her, Lestat!
MARIUS => You must!
MARIUS => I will not have you put everything at risk! You will mind our laws!
MARIUS => We remain in the shadows.   To do otherwise is a road to destruction...
MARIUS =>  I see you still have a few lingering mortal emotions. They will serve you no good, Lestat.
LESTAT => My God, what have you done to me?
LESTAT =>  She's just a child... forgive me.
LESTAT => The faces of my victims haunted me, rising behind my eyes, reminding me of my fate... I played for days trying to expel the last bit of my human feelings... and face the cold, dark wasteland of eternity...
YUPPIE => Wow. This is the coolest after hours club ever. You sure you don't want a drink?
VAMPIRE GIRL => Soon.
JESSE => Sure, all the time.
JESSE => You haven't seen the rest of my body.
JESSE => My host... oh he's here somewhere.
JESSE => Marius...
JESSE => Marius has the blood of the ancients flowing in his veins.
JESSE => That's a myth. Marius is around here somewhere...
JESSE => You... you really should meet him.
JESSE => Because... because... he's wise, a philosopher... he asks the big questions. Like how are you going to get through eternity? It's easier for us mortals. Life is brief, but for you...
JESSE => I mean... what can you really do with immortality besides just slip from one day to the next, trapped in a void of meaninglessness, relieved only by your next victim? How do you not give in to despair and just wither away from boredom, hopelessness?
JESSE => You know, it's like they say -- the more things change, the more they stay the same. For you that's forever, right?
JESSE => You saved me.
LESTAT => Perhaps... So you know Marius...
JESSE => I know a lot of things.
LESTAT => Not how to stay alive apparently.
JESSE => Well I guess we've got that in common. Although I think I'm a little ahead in the race here.
LESTAT =>  Well, I can fix that.
JESSE => 'Mine eyes dazzle, she died so young.' It's about the girl with the violin, isn't it?
LESTAT => Is it? And what else do you think you know?
JESSE =>  I... I think you're a lot like Marius, Lestat.
LESTAT =>  Am I?   Tell me all about it.
JESSE => You're... you're both artists.   He's a painter. You're a singer...
LESTAT => Is that so?   What I do is art, is it?
JESSE => Yes... From nothing... you try to create... something beautiful... (shaking now as her hand gets closer and closer) ... out of the... the cold, dark wasteland of eternity...
LESTAT =>  Something beautiful...
JESSE =>  But... but Marius isn't a rebel. You're different in that way. You don't want to hide, follow the laws, concealed in the shadows like some insect. You... you still want to walk with the living, don't you, Lestat?
LESTAT => Well, I'm not hiding now, am I?
JESSE => No, but the only time you're not really alone is when you kill... But, Lestat, you can't help it... it's not your fault... He made you this way...
LESTAT =>  Ah.    Poor, poor me...
LESTAT => Well, Talamascan, you're certainly a very clever librarian, aren't you?
LESTAT =>  How sad, you people always trying to know the unknowable... So, was it a good read? My diary.
LESTAT => Talamasca's been following me for years. I've never known one to be so brave. Or is it just foolish?
JESSE => I... I'm only an apprentice.
LESTAT => Go. I'm through with you. Your kind never satisfies my thirst.
JESSE => Does anything, Lestat?
JESSE => I mean, what's the point of coming into the light if not to have someone really know you?
JESSE => You want the world to see you're real, don't you, Lestat? Don't you? Well, here I am!
LESTAT => You better just stick to your books, Talamascan. 'Cause you have it all wrong. I love all this. I delight in it. The dark, dreary world I went to sleep in has burnt itself out and been replaced by the 20th Century -- can you imagine my joy at waking up to discover such a world? It has outdistanced my wildest dreams of it. I scream of good and evil, and mortals stand and cheer. I adore being back in action... every moment, every single drop of it! Now consider yourself exceedingly lucky and go!
JESSE => Lestat!
JESSE => There's something you left out of your diary.
LESTAT =>  What?
JESSE =>  You kept her violin, didn't you?
JESSE => Hey, it's okay. I understand...  After all, it's only human.
JESSE => Jesus Christ.
GROUPIE #2 => I heard that Lestat keeps all these girls in all his wine cellars, and it's really nice, and they give you food and cable and weed.
GROUPIE #1 => Oh, please...
GROUPIE #2 => That's what I heard. But you have to let him suck you on your neck whenever he wants. Doesn't sound too bad.
GROUPIE #1 =>  We've done worse.
GROUPIE #2 =>  Damn straight... Hey, do you remember that cute guy's name at the Kid Rock concert? The one behind the bathroom.
GROUPIE #1 => Oh yeah. Let me think... his first name was Blow. And his second name was Me, I think.
LESTAT =>  Clever, clever librarian.
ROGER => I didn't see you come in.
LESTAT => No, Roger, you wouldn't have.
ROGER => So this house is fine I assume. To your liking?
LESTAT => Yes.   For the moment.
ROGER => We'll be here for what?    A week you think?
LESTAT => Well... I wouldn't unpack if I were you. ROGER  Right... the... girls you asked for. They're in the guest wing.
LESTAT => Ah.   Yes.
ROGER => Do you want me to take them home later?
LESTAT => No, thank you, Roger. I'll make sure they're taken care of.
LESTAT => I don't think we've met.
GROUPIE #1 => Oh my God... It's really you, isn't it?
GROUPIE #2 => We want to be your slaves.
LESTAT => Of course you do.
GROUPIE #1 => Want some?
GROUPIE #1 => Want me?
GROUPIE #1 => You hungry?
LESTAT => I'm always hungry.
GROUPIE #1 => We've got the munchies?    You got any food?
LESTAT => Vampires don't eat... food.
GROUPIE #1 => You hungry for something else?
LESTAT => Mine eyes dazzle, she died so young.
GROUPIE #1 => Huh?
LESTAT => It's a very old poem of mine.
GROUPIE #1 => C'mon, don't you want to have some fun?
LESTAT => Don't do that.
GROUPIE #1 =>  Are you ticklish?
LESTAT =>  I'm very ticklish.
GROUPIE #2 => Hey, you ever been tickled by four hands at once? Hey, can you take both us, Lestat? What'd'ya think?
LESTAT => I don't know.     Let's see.
JESSE => You're right, David. The journal has everything in it.
TALBOT => I knew you'd appreciate its scientific significance.
JESSE => David, listen...  I'm going to Los Angeles for the concert.
TALBOT => What?   You are not! I forbid it.
JESSE => David, I... I talked to him... Look I'm sorry. But I... I have to see what's out there with my own eyes. I'm onto something. I just don't know what yet... I have to find out...
TALBOT => Jesse, you listen to me very, very carefully now. You are no longer seeing things clearly. Your emotions are clouding things.
JESSE => It's not emotion. It's instinct... I'll return when I have my findings. Good-bye.
TALBOT =>  Jesse, wait!
LESTAT => Yes, Marius was impressed with my thirst for knowledge... But it
LESTAT => Marius!
LESTAT => They're... alive.
LESTAT => Would you like me to play for you?
MARIUS => What have you done, Lestat? Lestat!
MARIUS =>  Lestat?
LESTAT => More!
MARIUS => I don't think so, my little lord.
LESTAT => Let me go!
MARIUS => No. You've drunk the purest blood. Seen the oldest of things -- far too much for one as young as you. You've been unconscious for days.
LESTAT => God, her blood is like liquid fire.  Who are they?
MARIUS => She... she is your mother, my mother... Akasha, the Queen of all who are damned. And he is her King.
LESTAT => Release me!
MARIUS => She made you quite powerful. (withdrawing a saber from its sheath) Don't make me use this!
LESTAT => Marius, please, just one more time. I felt the sun. The light, Marius, the light!
MARIUS => Lestat, listen to me! I have watched over Akasha and her King for 2000 years! They must never awaken!
MARIUS => Akasha and her King nearly drank this earth dry when they ruled over Egypt. They drank until they lost their will to drink. They became living statues. And yet Akasha still sustains the life force of all vampires. It is believed what happens to her, happens to all of us.
MARIUS => If she were ever to rise, she would again desiccate the earth! She has no respect for anything except the taste of blood. Immortal and human alike...
LESTAT => You'll not stop me...
MARIUS => I hear her blood in your voice... In all the years I've cared for them, not once have they moved...
LESTAT => Until tonight. And she chose me! Me! Never you! You'll not stop me!
MARIUS => You are part of a great coven! You take responsibility for your kind!
LESTAT =>  I must have more!
MARIUS => I chose you for your bravery, but I was wrong. You know only selfishness. I can no longer trust you... It gives me no pleasure to look upon what I have created.
LESTAT => Marius!
LESTAT => Marius!    Please!
LESTAT => Many times since, I have called to Marius. I howled into the night in loneliness and pain.
LESTAT => But there was no answer -- just the endless procession of days, months, years... My teacher left me to my darkest lesson -- that in the end, we are alone.
JESSE => Lestat.
JESSE => Akasha!
ATTENDANT => We've started our approach into L.A. You should fasten your seat belt.
LESTAT => I hate bedtime.
LESTAT =>  Marius...!
MARIUS => Lestat.
MARIUS => It is good to see you, Lestat.
LESTAT => And you. Still wearing the old fashions, I see.
MARIUS => Old habits die hard.
LESTAT => How did you manage to slip through the 1950s in red velvet?
MARIUS => I slept.
LESTAT => Don't think you missed much.
MARIUS => Elvis.
LESTAT => Elvis, yes.
MARIUS =>  You're bigger than he is now.
LESTAT => I'd say a few pounds lighter. Though, if you ever catch me wearing a white jumpsuit, you have my permission to slice off my head.
MARIUS => If someone doesn't get to you first.
LESTAT => Live and let live.
MARIUS => If it were only so simple, my son.
LESTAT =>  How did you find me?
MARIUS => You forget. We ancients have powers no ordinary vampires possess... And I know you. I remembered how you admired the medieval fortresses in the hilltowns of Lyon.  All you're missing is the moat and the cannons... which you may need.
LESTAT => Come, let me show you what it means to live in the light.
MARIUS =>  Impressive. Reminds me of mad old Druids running around chanting in the forest. Very primitive stuff.
LESTAT => Out there. My fans. Thousands and thousands. They worship me. Millions of arms reach out to embrace, beg me to come into their lives.
MARIUS => It's what you've always wanted.
LESTAT => With all my black little heart.
MARIUS => Do you think of anyone but yourself?
LESTAT => I only have myself.
MARIUS => It may be time to get ready for some company.
LESTAT => What's that supposed to mean?
MARIUS => Your music's woken a very old friend...
MARIUS => Can't you hear it? Or is the applause all you can hear now?
MARIUS => Akasha has risen. She has taken her King's blood. Absorbed his power. You've done it this time.
LESTAT => Good! I'm glad she's risen!     Let her come.
MARIUS => Don't you understand?   You must stop this concert!
LESTAT =>  200 years and the same broken record.
MARIUS => No. Not the same! You've only known Akasha dormant. She too will find you. She is choosing her moment. She has come to destroy you, Lestat. And in her wrath, she will devour everything that moves. Mortal and vampire alike.
LESTAT =>  Well then, it's every vampire for himself. Just the kind of rules I like. The rules you taught me.
LESTAT => Do you remember your first words to me, Marius? 'I am unknowable.'  I'd rather not exist at all than have to live eternally as a ghost.
MARIUS => And you're taking everyone with you, you fool! We were once mortals, too. It is our heritage we protect!
LESTAT =>  Such reverence for mortals! Then you should have left me as one!
MARIUS => You're a monster.
LESTAT =>  Said the vampire to his son.
AKASHA => Hello...
AKASHA => Hmmm... his scent is fading.     He was here too long ago...
VAMPIRE LOVER => You like him, love?
AKASHA =>  He reminds me of someone I know.
VAMPIRE LOVER => All he's gonna remind you of soon is a pile of bones. We're gonna dismember him. Bleed him dry.
AKASHA => Really? Is that what you're going to do?
AKASHA => Then again, you could always do this...
AKASHA => Turn up the music!
AKASHA =>  Oh, I do love the 21st Century.
MAEL => Marius, you've broken your oath. You were to watch over Akasha and Khayman. You are a great disappointment to me.
MARIUS => Pandora, Armand, it's been a long time. Khayman, Maharet, to what do I owe this honor?
KHAYMAN => You have been summoned because of your errant child...
PANDORA =>  He's quite the devil, isn't he?
ARMAND => His music mocks us, Pandora!
PANDORA => His music moves my blood.
ARMAND => Keep your amorous thoughts to yourself. His music is a threat to all vampires. We will let the covens dismember him at his concert.
MAEL => Yes.   It will set an example.
MARIUS => I don't see how this solves things. This isn't thought through.
KHAYMAN => Marius, we understand your affection for Lestat, but your duty is to us!
KHAYMAN => We could always get rid of him right now.
MAEL => No. We will contact the covens. Let them know we condone the slaying. It will be better for all to see.
MAHARET => Wait. Never mind Lestat!   We have greater problems...
MARIUS =>  Maharet is right. It is Akasha we face now.
PANDORA =>  Is it true, Maharet?   Has our Queen really risen!
MAHARET => Don't be so happy, Pandora. I knew Akasha when she walked this earth. I was her slave. I am now her enemy. I know what she is capable of.
ARMAND => Yes. We've all felt her presence, even as she hides from us. (as others nod, acknowledging the truth of this) What does she want now?
MAHARET => She knows only one thing. Taking pleasure in destroying life. She is already killing the young ones to build her strength.
MARIUS => She's sucked the life out of her King like a praying mantis. I sense she is getting closer.
MAHARET => She has come to destroy Lestat, but he will only whet her thirst more...
MAHARET => If we act together, we have a chance to destroy her.
MAHARET => Yes! We must destroy her immediately! If she is not stopped, I'm afraid of what will happen to the entire mortal world.
MAEL => But can she be destroyed? I am left to bear the scars of the last attempt on her life. She was dragged into the sun. She survived. But we almost didn't...
MARIUS => What happens to our Queen happens to us. If Akasha dies, we die as well.
MAHARET => Then so be it! We must take that chance.
MAHARET => We must destroy Akasha. For the sake of humanity! We must find her. Now!
ARMAND => But perhaps she has come to kill Lestat and then will go back to her slumber. That is our only hope.
PANDORA =>  Yes. That's right. She and the covens will take care of that brat. We must go to the concert and pay our respects to our great Queen.
MAHARET => How? With your own throat! You've all been asleep too long! You're still dreaming.
MARIUS => Maharet speaks the truth.   It is our only hope.
MAEL => No. Armand is right. We will go to the concert and first see what she does. There may be no need for action.
MAHARET => Then you go to the concert and you shall see!  And I thought the Ancients became wise with their years.
ROGER => The... girls you asked for, Lestat. They're here, in the guest wing.
LESTAT => Ah.   Yes.
ROGER => I was uh... just gonna go catch a movie at the Chinese. I don't suppose you'd all want to...
LESTAT => No, thank you, Roger.   We'll entertain ourselves.
GROUPIE #3 => Oh my God, it's him!    It's really him...
LESTAT => Perhaps you would like a tour of the place... first.
GROUPIE #3 => Oh yeah, wow, we'd love that.
LESTAT => Roger... would you be so kind?
ROGER =>  Sure. Right this way, girls.
LESTAT => Roger. Not that one.   Leave her to me...
LESTAT => You must be very keen to die.
LESTAT => The Talamascans have become quite stealthy. I didn't know infiltration was quite their style.
JESSE => It's not. I... I came on my own.
LESTAT => How did you find me?
JESSE => I've been tracking your manager for days... (gesturing to her Goth outfit) Then I figured out you simply have to look the part.
LESTAT => Clever librarian... You should know, based on all your research, that groupies don't ever find their way out of here again.
JESSE => I'm not a groupie...
LESTAT => Then why are you following me? What do you want?
JESSE =>  Are you granting wishes?
LESTAT =>  Last wishes. What's yours?
JESSE => Show me what it's like to be you. That's my last wish. Grant it, Lestat.
LESTAT =>  I don't have time for this.
JESSE => All a vampire has is time.
LESTAT => Maybe not.
JESSE =>  Right. The covens are coming for you.  I understand why you're doing it. You have to be who you are, no matter what happens.
JESSE => But how are you spending what may be your last night on Earth, Lestat? As you always have... Alone.
JESSE => Don't kill me yet. Let's spend our last nights together. Share it with me.   Show me what it's like to be you.
LESTAT => You don't know what you're asking! I don't know what's in that librarian's head of yours, but it's not what you think.
JESSE => That's right. You don't know what's in my head, Lestat. Do you want to?
LESTAT => I'll know when I kill you.
JESSE => Gee, Lestat, that's a great way to get to know someone. Here. I'll give you a preview. Coming attractions. This is what you'll find.
JESSE => I have this recurring dream that I'm a child and I'm living in this big house filled with vampires. And every night when I go to sleep, I wish to God the same thing... you know what that is, Lestat?
JESSE => That I will have the dream again... Because in the dream I'm happy. And the dream is more real than my life... I don't know how, but I know you, Lestat... My life is a big mystery and you, you have the answer...
JESSE => I can't go on pretending this life of mine is real. I can't live a lie... I'm just like you Lestat. We're the same...
LESTAT =>  Are we? I seek the light.     You seek the shadows.
JESSE => No. We're looking for exactly the same thing. You know it... Please. Show me.
LESTAT => Alright!
LESTAT => This may be painful for a mortal. You're still attached to your skin.
JESSE =>  I don't care.
LESTAT => Close your eyes.    Don't breathe.
JESSE => Do that again!
LESTAT => And now for my next trick.
JESSE => Did it hurt?
LESTAT => Yes. For just a moment. But as the pain is more intense for us, so is ecstacy.  You see, we love our victims.
JESSE => Love?    I thought it was the blood.
LESTAT => No, although the taste is so rich and sweet. Love is the essence of the dark gift. The connection is so much more satisfying, brief as it is, than anything else.
LESTAT => As you drink, you feel the heart weakening... it struggles even though there's no hope. You feel the life slipping away, the flash of those brief years. The taste of mortality you can no longer experience... and it is beautiful...  No 'relationship,' no commingling can ever reach the heights of that experience.
LESTAT =>  Your blood...
JESSE =>  Do you like it?
LESTAT =>  Yes...
JESSE =>  Do it to me... Please... With your blood I'll know you...
JESSE => I'll know everything...
LESTAT => You want to know everything. You want to see what it's like. Then come! I'll show you.
bench. => 
JESSE => Is she alright?
LESTAT => Come closer, Jesse. You want to see? You want to know?
JESSE => Lestat, no!
LESTAT => You see now? Are you ready?     Now do you want it?!
LESTAT => No.   Of course you don't.
LESTAT => Well I didn't grant your final wish.  It was an impossible wish to begin with. You see, I am unknowable.
JESSE => Lestat!    Wait!
LESTAT => Good-bye, Talamascan.
YOUNG JESSE =>  Why can't I stay with you?! Please, Auntie Maharet!
MAHARET => I don't want you to go, but you must.
YOUNG JESSE => Auntie, you're bleeding...
MAHARET => You must be with your own, my sweetest girl. I'll always be watching over you.
YOUNG JESSE => I want to stay with you forever.
MAHARET => Forever is a very long time.
MAHARET => Hello, my princess.
JESSE => Aunt Maharet?
JESSE => You're a...?
MAHARET => Yes. Oh, Jesse, I've missed you so much, but I had to keep this from you.
JESSE => Oh my God, this is why... I knew I was different. I knew --
MAHARET =>  Come...
MAHARET => You are the most precious of my great family...
JESSE => Am I...?
MAHARET =>  No. You are not. I was once mortal, too. My sister died before her child was one year old. I took care of that child, and her children, and her children's children...
MAHARET => This is our family -- my way of coping with eternity. The labyrinth of life. The family teaches me the rhythms and passions of each age.
MAHARET => You are my most prized light. You are what keeps me connected to the world of the living.
MAHARET => When your parents died I took you to India to take care of you.
JESSE => And something happened there.
MAHARET => I stopped it from happening.    And I will again.
MAHARET => Jesse, you must stay away from Lestat. You must forget all about him.
MAHARET => Yes, I know about your new friend. You think you love him, but it's not as you thought it would be.
JESSE => I thought I was like him.
MAHARET => I know, but it is not who you are, not who you are meant to be. You have found that out now.
JESSE => Lestat's all I can think about... I felt like I belonged with him. Now I know why...
MAHARET => Jesse, you must forget about him. You must trust me...
JESSE =>  I missed you so much, Aunt Maharet.
MAHARET => Me too.
MAHARET => You will go home to London in the morning.
JESSE => But this is my home. This is where I belong. Why do you want to get rid of me so quickly?
MAHARET => Now is not the time to be here...
MAHARET => You were seeking answers. Now you have found them. The family is who you are.
MAHARET => You will go home to London tomorrow.
LESTAT =>  Jesse.
JESSE => Dear Aunt Maharet, my whole life, I've felt... kind of crazy I guess, different from everyone, and now I know why... You say I now know who I am meant to be... I have found my answers. You are right...
JESSE => I know you want me to be a regular human girl... but I'm not. I can't be...
JESSE => Lestat is my destiny... I know that now. I love you, Aunt Maharet. Good-bye.
VAMPIRE DRIVER => Need a ride?
JESSE =>  Yeah.
DAVID => Jesse!
VOICE => Sorry, Grandpa!
MARIUS =>  Hello, David.
MARIUS => I must show you my new paintings sometime.
PANDORA =>  It's just like Nero's day.
MAHARET => Akasha will not be able to resist this...
ROGER => They're getting pretty worked up out there.
at them. => 
LESTAT => Come on, children.
LESTAT => I'm so glad I decided to rise...  After tonight, Death Valley will live up to its name!
ENGINEER #1 =>  Could we turn it down a tad?
ENGINEER #2 => His mic's not even up.
LESTAT => You want more?!
CROWD => Yes!
LESTAT => This one's for those who've come for me!
PANDORA => There are too many of them! They're going to dismember him.
ARMAND => Good!
LESTAT => Get out of here!
JESSE => Lestat!    Lestat!
MARIUS =>  Akasha.
MAHARET => She is here...
FIRE MARSHAL => You don't have a permit for any of these stunts!
ROGER => I told you I don't know anything about it!
ROGER => Last time I work for a bloody vampire...
JESSE => Lestat!    Lestat!
LESTAT => Akasha...
AKASHA => Why so surprised, my love?    You called, and I have come.
AKASHA => Never fear me, Lestat. Your wishes have all come true.
LESTAT => My wishes...?
AKASHA => You have yearned for a companion to share eternity. You have cried out to the world. I have answered your call.
AKASHA => You are so bold, like your music. It woke me. You live your life in the open, like I did long ago, when I had a King.
LESTAT => Had a King?
AKASHA => He's no more. You are my consort. I've kept you safe -- alive.
LESTAT => You?
AKASHA => You thought it was all you?  You have the ego of a king as well. I know you, Lestat. I know that you crave to have the world at your feet. I have come to give it to you.
AKASHA => Has your tongue lost its taste for blood?
LESTAT =>  Never.
AKASHA => But you didn't kill the mortal girl.
AKASHA => Instead you kissed her.   Now kiss me.
AKASHA => Be my King. Forget about everything else.
AKASHA => What's your answer?
LESTAT => Can we try that again?
LESTAT => Show me the world...
MAHARET => We see now what Akasha means to do. Rule as Queen again. (pointing to the great family) This is why we must fight Akasha!
MAHARET => For the sake of all mortals. She must be stopped, or the mortal world will end.
MAEL => But is there a way?   We don't know.
KHAYMAN => When she opens herself to give her blood, she is vulnerable.
MARIUS => Then we weaken her. Drain her of almost all her blood, but leave her just one drop.
MAHARET => We can't take that chance.    We must finish her.
ARMAND => If she dies, we all die.
PANDORA => We're damned no matter what happens.
MAHARET => Perhaps.
JESSE => And what about Lestat?
MAHARET => Lestat has joined with Akasha. He is lost to us now. He is never coming back.
JESSE => I don't believe that.
LESTAT => Where are we?
AKASHA => We are home.
LESTAT => You live here?
AKASHA => We live everywhere and anywhere we choose. The world is our garden.
LESTAT => So warm...  ... their blood...
AKASHA => ... yes...
LESTAT => ... they're mortal...
AKASHA => ... of course. They serve the living goddess, and her consort. They find you beautiful. You are a god in their eyes.
AKASHA => Behold our Kingdom.
LESTAT => Why?
AKASHA =>  Why not?
LESTAT => This is the reason you have risen?
AKASHA => They believed in nothing, now they are nothing. But you and I will change all that. We will give the world something to believe in again.
AKASHA => Come, my King.      We have a score to settle.
MARIUS => She comes...
AKASHA => My children. It warms my blood to see you all gathered... plotting against me.
MAHARET => Akasha.
AKASHA => Maharet. You will address my King first...
JESSE => Lestat!
JESSE => What has she done to you?
LESTAT => Made me see.
MARIUS => Lestat... step aside.
LESTAT => Never.    She is my Queen.
MAHARET => Akasha. The world has changed since you reigned.
AKASHA => Then we shall change it back. Humans are animals, brute creatures. Their destruction can only make sense.
MAHARET => We've found other ways to co- exist.
AKASHA => Yes. In the shadows. In silence. In shame. For what? For respect of mortals? They are nothing to us. They are only... food.
AKASHA => Poor Maharet. Still trying to hold onto what I took from you.
MARIUS => Akasha, please...
AKASHA =>  You think you can change my will? I'm tired of this discussion. Join me, or die.
MAHARET => I will not.
MARIUS => I will not.
AKASHA => I want to hear it from every one of you. What will it be?
AKASHA => Don't tell me, you have feelings for these ridiculous mortals!
AKASHA => Do you love me?
LESTAT => Yes...
AKASHA => Prove it. Kill her.
LESTAT => She's nothing to me.
AKASHA => Just the same, I'd like you to kill her. For me.  I've had enough of this 'great family.' It's time to end it.
MAHARET => You will not touch her!
AKASHA => You still think to challenge me, Maharet?
MAHARET => I beg you, spare this child.
AKASHA => Now.
JESSE => It's all right, Maharet.
JESSE => It's what I want.   I am ready.
AKASHA =>  How sweet...
AKASHA => Good-bye, great family.
AKASHA => Now, my children, remember your real family! Or else.
LESTAT => But, My Queen, you've forgotten my reward!
AKASHA => That's right. My King, you've just earned your crown.
AKASHA => You see how he obeys.    You will or you will all die!
AKASHA => That's enough, Lestat.
AKASHA => Lestat.    Enough.   Stop!
AKASHA => You kill me, you kill yourselves.
MAHARET => Wait, Lestat! You must stop!
KHAYMAN =>  We survived!
LESTAT => I left you one drop, my love. Drink deep and live.
JESSE => I thought I'd lost you...
LESTAT => Drink, my love.
LESTAT => I will never leave you again.
JESSE => Maharet...
MAHARET => My child, let me look at you... You are finally happy. It is as it should be now... I will watch over you always.
ARMAND =>  She took Akasha's last drop, took Akasha's death into herself. Behold, our Queen... our new mother...
JESSE => Is she... dead?
KHAYMAN => No, she will live forever. She sleeps. She sleeps, and dreams of us.
MARIUS => My Queen, I will watch over you always.
JESSE => Good question...
TALBOT => Jesse.     My God...
JESSE =>  David, this is Lestat.
TALBOT => How do you do?
LESTAT => Charmed, I'm sure.
JESSE => I told you I'd return with my findings. Here they are.
TALBOT => But please, sit down. You'll have to excuse me... it's just so... so...
LESTAT => Unexpected?
TALBOT => Strangely, no...
JESSE => Please don't be sad. I'm where I belong. I'm happy now.
TALBOT => Excuse me for asking but...
JESSE =>  What's it like?
TALBOT => Yes.
JESSE => Do you want to find out?
TALBOT => Me?... No. I'm too old to live forever.
JESSE => Well, if you ever should change your mind... Oh. I have a present for you. From an old friend.
JESSE => And Marius sent a message. You were right. He doesn't go to the Dorchester. But he's gonna be at Claridge's later...
JESSE => Well, I guess this is good-bye.
TALBOT => Yes.   Take care of her, Lestat.
LESTAT => Always.
TALBOT => Good-bye, Jesse.
JESSE => Good-bye, dear friend.
LESTAT => Shall we go get a drink, love?
