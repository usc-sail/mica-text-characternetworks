LYNCH => I don't see her.
DAN => The shift change is late.   Just wait.
PARKER O'NEIL => sighs and stares back at the lift lane.
PARKER => Are you sure about this?
DAN => We've been doing this forever. Trust me. This lady loves Lynch. She always goes for it.
LYNCH => I'm cute.
PARKER => Is um... is that her?
DAN => Shit.
LYNCH => Dude.
DAN => It's cool, it's cool.  Look, all you have to do is smile real pretty and tell him-
PARKER => -What?   Me? No way.    This is your thing.
LYNCH => -GIRLfriends. Say "girlfriends".
DAN => -you and your girlfriends forgot your credit card and you can't pick up your lift tickets.
DAN => Start at $50. That's what we usually give the other lady. He'll take it. Trust me.
PARKER => Dan, no.   You do it.    I feel stupid.
DAN => You've got this.    You can totally do this.
LYNCH => Parker, you've so got this.
DAN => The worst thing that happens is he says no. He won't say no. No one ever says no.
PARKER => Why me?
LYNCH => `Cause you're a girl.
DAN => A very beautiful girl with a very charming smile. 
DAN => There.
PARKER => My charming smile?
PARKER => Hey.
PARKER => Could I bum a smoke?
PARKER => Thanks.
PARKER => I'm Parker.
JASON => Jason.
PARKER => Oh, cool.    My brother's name is Jason.
JASON => OK.
PARKER => Yeah, so I don't want to waste your time and bullshit you cause you seem like a wicked busy guy and everything...but..this is gonna sound so stupid...
PARKER => My girlfriends and I drove all the way up here from Salem State, and I was sort of the dumbass who told everyone that I could cover the lift tickets on my Mom's credit card...but then I left her credit card at the gas station...and so...
JASON => Right.
PARKER => No- but I mean, we totally have some cash and stuff. We just don't have enough to cover all 3 lift tickets, you know?
JASON => How much?
PARKER => Like...fifty?
JASON => I could lose my job.
LYNCH => He's not going for it.
DAN => Will you shut up? He's gonna go for it. It's either stand there and do the job for minimal... minimal, what is it?
LYNCH => Minimum.
DAN => -Minimum wage or do it for minimum wage plus a little bit more.
LYNCH => She had to come skiing with us?
DAN => You said you didn't mind?
LYNCH => I don't.   I don't mind.   Don't mind at all.
LYNCH => I'm just saying, you haven't done dollar pitchers at Fezziwigs with
LYNCH => For ten minutes, Dan. Football games are more than ten minutes.
DAN => Dude, I have a girlfriend now. I love this girl. I don't know what you...
LYNCH => No, no it's fine. I'm just saying, the Mount Holliston day trips were our thing, you know? She doesn't even know how to board yet.
DAN => She's getting better.  Now I feel like a dick. You should have said something if it was a problem.
LYNCH => It's not a problem. It's not. Forget I ever said anything.
DAN => Good work!     See?   They always go for it.
PARKER => I did good, right?
LYNCH => You did great.
DAN => Oh, so where's my change?
PARKER => There isn't any.
DAN => You gave him the full hundred?
PARKER => He wasn't going for it at 50.
LYNCH => I would have asked for change.
PARKER => It's still way cheaper than paying for tickets, right?
LYNCH => I would have definitely asked him for change.
JASON =>  "Girlfriends"?
DAN => Look at that. See? All these other idiots are paying top dollar to ski. Not us. All thanks to you, baby.
PARKER =>  Oh, now I'm "baby"?     You never call me pet names.
DAN => I'm just not a `pet name' guy.
PARKER =>  He calls me "Parker."
DAN => It's your name.
PARKER => Yeah but you're supposed to call me something affectionate, you know? Like "honey" or "sweetie".
LYNCH => I hooked up with a girl last semester that called me by my last name in bed. It was so weird. "Oh, Lynch! Your hair is so soft! Do me harder, Lynch!" It was like I was throwing it to Dan over here.
DAN => See? At least I don't call you "O'Neil".
PARKER => You don't touch my face enough either.
LYNCH => 
LYNCH => Hey, that's not fair. I'm not dating you, you don't get to make my life suck.
DAN => Wha-? I never said that. I never said you make my life suck.  Sweetie.
LYNCH =>  Dan tells me you're getting the hang of that board?
PARKER => I wouldn't say that. But last time we went I did pretty good, right?
DAN => You did awesome. I'm telling you, the first few times are frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it's like riding a bike.  DAN  Are you gonna trade in those ancient things for a board?
LYNCH => Please. Snowboards are too EMO for me. Give it ten more years and that fad will be dead.
DAN => That's what they said about rap.
LYNCH => Mmm-mmm. Smell that fresh mountain air, huh? Kind of smells like... cancer.
PARKER => You know what, I am so sick of potheads giving me shit about smoking butts.
LYNCH => At least pot does something for you. Cigarettes are just gross. Especially out in the cold. It like sticks to you and then you smell like a mixture of ash tray and an old man's used floss.
DAN => Used floss? Where do you come up with this shit.
DAN => No, I have never- why would I ever sniff my floss? Why am I friends with you?
DAN => Gimme a drag.
PARKER => What time do you think we'll get back? I have about 2 weeks worth of chapters to read tonight.
LYNCH => Oh no. She broke the rule.
DAN => No worrying about the bullshit of real life. The whole point of this
PARKER => But, I haven't read a-
DAN => It's alright.
LYNCH => Uh-oh! Is someone afraid of heights?
PARKER => No.
LYNCH => So it doesn't bother you when I do this?
PARKER => Quit it!
PARKER => I'm not afraid of heights.   I just
DAN => Baby, in the whole history of time, only one chair has ever fallen off
PARKER => Points for calling me "baby" but you just made that statistic up.
LYNCH => Yeah, statistics don't work on smokers.
LYNCH => OK, WHAT ASSHOLE COULDN'T GET ON THE CHAIR RIGHT?
LYNCH => COME ON, I PAID GOOD MONEY TO DO SOME SKIING!
DAN => Actually, I paid good money.
LYNCH => Yeah, but I'm gonna pay you back so it's like the same thing.
LYNCH => THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! WOO!
PARKER => Why do I have to wear a helmet?
DAN => Safety first.
PARKER => But you guys don't wear them.
PARKER => I only see little kids wearing them.
PARKER => You're just doing this to make fun of me.
DAN => No, I'm not. I swear.    You look hot in a helmet.
LYNCH => Need some help?
SHANNON =>  Do you think?
PARKER => Aww, check out Lynch.
RYAN => What the hell?
LYNCH => Woah! Shit, man!    I was just trying to help!
SHANNON => Ryan, what the hell?
RYAN => He had his hands all over you!
SHANNON => No he didn't. I can take care of myself!
SHANNON => I am so sorry about that. He can
LYNCH => I was seriously just trying to help. I mean, how could I even
SHANNON => 
LYNCH => Yeah, I'm fine.
SHANNON => Well, thank you for your help.    I am so, so sorry about that.
LYNCH => Joe.
RYAN =>  Shan!
SHANNON => Well it was nice to meet you.
LYNCH =>  I was like one second away from beating that guy's ass.
DAN => I know you were, man.   Come on. Don't sweat it.
LYNCH => Seriously, that guy was such a dick.
PARKER => Come on boys. We can talk about how tough you both are at the bottom.
DAN => I'm tough.
PARKER => I know you are.
PARKER => Are you kidding? We are totally doing this every weekend. In fact, if they were open during the week I'd say we should cut class, too.
LYNCH => Last one to the bottom is buying dinner!
DAN => We gotta take a weekend trip up
DAN => Done. When I stayed with my cousin out West two years ago it was like
LYNCH => Well, speaking of good skiing... it's been cool doing the bunny hill
DAN => Dude, you didn't have to stay with us. It's totally cool if you want to go off for a few.
LYNCH => No, it's fine. I'm just saying let's step it up a notch at some point. It's been cool watching Parker fall on her ass all day but I would like to actually ski at some point.
PARKER => You know, I've probably had enough for today anyway. I can just stay in the lodge if you guys want to go-
LYNCH => -no, no, no that's not what I meant. I didn't mean it like that.
PARKER => I told you I didn't have to come.
LYNCH => Parker, I didn't not want you to come.
DAN => It was his idea that we invited you in the first place.
LYNCH => Exactly. Remember? I was like "Hey man, why doesn't Parker come
DAN => -I was like, "OK that would be cool".
PARKER => It's OK, you guys. The last thing a girl wants to do is intrude on "guy time". I won't be offended. I've got stuff I could do anyway.  Actually, can I have the key? I should check my messages.
DAN => No. No locker key. I can tell you right now that every message on there is going to be from your Mom giving you more aggravation about whatever the hell.
PARKER => She does not.
DAN => Ready for this? Two nights ago we were watching a movie and her Mom
DAN => She wanted to know if we wanted to have chicken soup or vegetable soup with Christmas dinner. Christmas dinner! Four weeks away, and she had to now right then and there what kind of soup we'd prefer.
LYNCH => What did you say?   You said chicken.
PARKER => I'm sorry if I ruined skiing for you today.
LYNCH => You didn't! You didn't at all! You missed the part before you walked over here when I was all like, "Dude, this has been so cool...you know...doing..."
LYNCH =>  What?
SHANNON => Joe!
LYNCH =>  Wait up.
SHANNON => Hey. I just wanted to apologize again.
LYNCH => Oh, no big deal. He's just lucky he didn't make me mad. You know, I just look half your boyfriend's size.
SHANNON => Ex. He's my ex-boyfriend. We're, you know, trying to still be friends and everything but as you can see, that's not really gonna work.
LYNCH =>  No way.
SHANNON => A group of us all agreed to go skiing this weekend and well, whatever. It's a whole story and-
SHANNON => -I don't want to hold you up. But that was just really embarrassing. So I just wanted to say sorry. 
LYNCH => Where, here? Yeah, probably, yes.
SHANNON => Cool. Well, my roommate and I come like every Sunday, so maybe I'll see you.
SHANNON => OK.   See ya later.
LYNCH => Actually, you know what? Would it be cool if I got your number or
SHANNON => Yeah, sure.
LYNCH => Shit. Don't ski with my phone. It's in the locker with everyone else's stuff. Do you have a pen?
SHANNON => Don't ski with a pen.     Sorry.
LYNCH => Just shoot then. I've got a really good memory. I've only smoked pot like 500 times so I'm good.
SHANNON => You know it's a gateway drug right?
SHANNON => Kidding.
LYNCH => Whew.   You! That's so like you!
DAN => But we gave you a hundred bucks and we've only gotten like 4 runs!
JASON => It's not my decision, man.    They're closing early.
JASON => Why don't you write a letter?
LYNCH =>  Remember "429".
DAN => What?
LYNCH => Just remember "429".  "5022". "5022." "5022."
PARKER => 
JASON => Sorry.
DAN => Honestly, I'd slide you some more money but we gave you everything we have.
LYNCH =>  Hey man, do you have a pen?
JASON => It's not about the money. They need to clear the mountain. We've got weather coming in. There's nothing I can do.
PARKER => What if we promise to run straight
DAN => Wicked fast.
JASON => Fine. But hurry. DAN                              PARKER Thank you!                           Thank you so much!
DAN => We'll be wicked fast.    Like the wind!
LYNCH => Seriously. For a hundred bucks
DAN => I know right? They're supposed to
LYNCH => Wachusett still has night skiing.
lame. =>  Hey, you remember the numbers I told you?
DAN => "429".
PARKER => Good for you, Lynch.   You got her number!
DAN => What did He-Man have to say about that?
PARKER => Nope.
RIFKIN => Early night, huh?
JASON => You're not gonna hear me complain.
RIFKIN => Pendergraft wants you to stop by the office.   Something about next weekend's schedule.
JASON => I'm not working next weekend.
JASON => Oh, come on. It's my brother's bachelor party. I put in for it two months ago.
RIFKIN => Go talk to the boss. He's getting ready to leave.
JASON => I'm the best man!  Shit.
RIFKIN => Ready to shut down?
JASON => There's three more on their way down. Wait for them, then it's all set.
PARKER => I'm not waiting til we get back to campus to eat. I'm starving.
DAN => Why didn't you have some pizza?
PARKER => You mean the cardboard with tomato sauce that you guys ate? That wasn't pizza. That was like,
LYNCH => There's a Papa Gino's on our way
PARKER => Sweet. I am gonna eat a whole real
DAN => Check it out!
DAN => We are so hitting that jump.
PARKER => Jesus!
DAN => It's just wind, Parker.
LYNCH => Don't you mean, "baby"?
DAN =>  Who invited you?
RIFKIN => I've gotta piss so bad I can taste it. Can you just take over for 2 minutes?
RIFKIN => Asshole.
PARKER => Shit.   Do you hear that?
DAN => It's the mountains.    It snows every night. Relax.
PARKER => Seriously. I'm gonna eat a whole pizza.  I'm not even kidding.
RIFKIN => Cool. Last three just hit.   I'm
VOICE => Clear up here.
DAN => Oh, come on.
PARKER => Bur!
LYNCH =>  IT'S FRIGGIN COLD UP HERE!   NO TIME FOR THIS CRAP! THANK YOU!
PARKER => It's gonna start again, right?
DAN => 
Yes. =>  Anyone got any jokes?
DAN => "Get off me, you're crushing my
LYNCH => I told you that?
DAN => What do you think the worst way to die would be?
PARKER => That's not morbid.
LYNCH => Yeah, seriously.    That's kinda spooky, Dan.
DAN => I think getting eaten by a shark would be the worst way to go.  Not if it was like one of those
what happened. =>  You know. Cause it like came up
LYNCH => The chick on the Jaws poster was
PARKER => She was?
LYNCH => I don't know. She was naked. Naked chicks are hot.
DAN => But if you actually like saw the fin coming for you in the water. That would be worse than actually
LYNCH => That's why I only swim in pools.
PARKER => I think burning to death would be the worst.
LYNCH => Well yes and no. Because most people die of the smoke inhalation before any fire even hits them.
PARKER => I remember watching TV for like 3
LYNCH => But they say that when you jump
PARKER => OK, then Lynch. What is the worst
LYNCH =>  What?
PARKER => No, you have an answer for
LYNCH => Easy.   The Sarlaac pit.
PARKER => The what?
LYNCH => The Sarlaac pit. From Return of the Jedi? Hel-lo...being slowly digested over 1,000 years? Worst. Death. Ever.
DAN =>  "I don't know why I never have a girlfriend, you guys!"
LYNCH => Shut-up.
DAN => Give it a minute.
LYNCH => This is nothing man. At Stowe last year, me and Solet were stranded for like 25 minutes. This big chick fell getting off up top and
DAN =>  WHAT THE FUCK??!    HELLO???!!!!
LYNCH => Come on now! This is messed up.
PARKER => HEY! TURN THE LIGHTS BACK ON! HELLO!!!!
DAN => Are they fucking kidding?
LYNCH => I kind of just shat in my pants a bit, I'm not gonna lie.
DAN => HE-LLO!!!!!!!!!!!????
PARKER =>  No one knows we're up here.    They forgot that we're up here.
DAN => No they didn't. They couldn't have. I'm sure they have a system or something. There's probably security cameras on us right now.
DAN => HEY ASSHOLES?! START THE CHAIR!!! WE'RE FREEZING UP HERE!!!
PARKER => What if they don't start it again?
DAN =>  Will you stop?!
LYNCH => What did you say to the guy?
DAN => Me?   Nothing!
LYNCH => Well, clearly you pissed him off enough to do this.
DAN => I didn't do anything!   He knows we're still up here.
PARKER => Then why are the lights off, Dan? Is that part of their policy? Shut
DAN => They just lost power or something.
any second. =>  They didn't go home. That's retarded.
LYNCH => This is so messed up.
DAN => It's a power outage. They'll come up with a ladder if they have to.
DAN => Well you being all psycho about it isn't gonna make it move. Just chill out.
PARKER => Don't yell at me.
DAN => I wasn't yelling at you but you need to relax. This stuff happens all the time. Can you imagine the law suit if they left everyone on this lift up here all night?
LYNCH => Free lift tickets.
PARKER => What other people on the lift? There was no one in front of us.
DAN => We won't be stuck here all night.
PARKER => No. You're right. We won't be here all night. It's Sunday.  Its fucking Sunday and they aren't
PARKER => We're gonna die up here.
LYNCH => We're not going to be stuck here. Parker. Parker, look at me. Even
DAN => It's true. I've done it before. You just get tired of waiting, you wait for a spot with some serious powder and you just jump. It's actually kind of fun, but they can ban you from the mountain for it.
PARKER =>  -HELP!!! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP US!!!! HEL-LO!!! HELP!!!!!
DAN => Shh. I know you're scared. I'm scared, too. But any minute now they're gonna turn the power back on and we're all gonna be laughing about this.
LYNCH => That makes two of us.
LYNCH => Well, what do you want me to do?   I gotta go.
PARKER => Are you crazy! Put the bar down!!!
LYNCH => It's just the safety bar. It doesn't really do anything anyway.
PARKER => Well I like the safety bar and I like it down where it's supposed to be.
DAN => Then how are you going to piss?
PARKER => I can hold it.
Sorry. =>  She's the one who said we'd be here for "a week"!
PARKER => I can hold it.
LYNCH => I'm pissing.
DAN => I hope they catch you and throw you out. I hope they ban you from the
LYNCH => Ban me from the mountain? You couldn't pay me to come back here. Make me sit up here in below zero weather forever while they get their damn Fisher Price lift working? Sorry. Not coming back.
LYNCH => There.   Much better.
LYNCH => SOMEBODY GET US DOWN FROM HERE!
DAN =>  Put the safety bar down, Joe.
LYNCH => SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP US!
DAN =>  Put the bar down.
DAN => PUT THE BAR DOWN!
DAN => What did I tell you guys, huh?   WOO- HOO! UP HERE!
PARKER => Oh, thank God.
PARKER => UP HERE!
DAN => HELLO!
PARKER => Why isn't he stopping?
LYNCH => HEY!   WHAT THE HELL?!!
VOICE => Steve.
STEVE => Go for Steve.
VOICE => We got a problem here.
STEVE => That's gonna take me 20 minutes!
VOICE => Sorry brother, but it's a frozen swimming pool down here.
LYNCH => What is this asshole doing?
PARKER => No!   No!
PARKER => NOOOO!!!!!!
PARKER => My face is burning.
DAN => The power is coming back on soon.
PARKER => No it isn't.
DAN => It has to.
DAN => Anyone know what time it is?    I
LYNCH => Me neither. I use my phone. Hold on, let me just run back to the
LYNCH => OK, top 3 breakfast cereals of all time. Go.
LYNCH => I'll go first.
PARKER => Stop.
LYNCH => Crunch Berries...
PARKER => Please, stop.
DAN => Dude, quit it.
LYNCH => ...and I'm gonna go out on a limb and say Lucky Charms pre-purple horseshoes.
LYNCH => There's just something weird about eating purple horseshoes, am I right?
PARKER => Everyone went home.    They left us up here.
LYNCH => Top 3 celebrities you'd do.  Me first again? Fine...
DAN => Someone has to jump.
DAN => We can't just sit up here until next weekend. We'll die.
DAN => Shhh.   It's OK.
LYNCH => SOMEBODY HELP US!!
PARKER => 
DAN =>  You're not gonna die, baby. I
DAN =>  It's alright. It's alright.
DAN => Hey.    It's snowing.
LYNCH => Great.  Best Christmas present you ever got? Go.
PARKER => Shayna.   My puppy.
DAN => Disneyworld in 8th grade.
LYNCH => Hmm...guess that leaves me. I'm gonna go with...oh yeah...these skis! Get it? MY SKIS. How ironic, huh?
PARKER => Shit!
PARKER => Shut-up.
PARKER => -what, what are you doing?
DAN => I'm jumping. I'm gonna get help.
LYNCH => Dan...woah. Let's talk about this.
PARKER => No.    No, don't leave me up here.
DAN => Parker, I can do this. Even if I get hurt, as long as I can get to the bottom I....your skin is so red. You're getting frost bite.
LYNCH => You can't get frost bite that fast. It's only been- what, like...how long has it been? A few hours, tops?
PARKER => 
DAN => I'll get help. Lynch is here. He'll be with you.
LYNCH => Dan, it's a far drop.     I don't know.
DAN =>  Do you have a better idea? I'm telling you, I've totally jumped off of a lift before.
DAN => I can do this.
PARKER => No, no, no. Please don't jump down there, Dan. You'll get hurt.
LYNCH => How are you going to find your way in the dark?
DAN => I'll stick to the trail. I'll ride to the bottom.
DAN => OK.
LYNCH => Walker, no.
DAN => One.
DAN => ...Two.
DAN => Remember when I was saying how I jumped off one of these things before?
DAN => I totally lied. I'm scared shitless right now.
DAN => 
DAN => AHHH!!     OH MY GOD!   AHHHH!!!!
PARKER => DAN!   DANNY? Oh my god!
LYNCH => Dan, say something.     Are you alright?
DAN => My legs.    I broke my fucking legs.
LYNCH => Oh, shit.
PARKER => Can you move? Dan?  Hold on. Hold on, baby.
LYNCH => What are you doing?
PARKER => I gotta...I have to get to him.
LYNCH => You'll just get hurt, too.   Stop. Calm down.
PARKER => Calm down?!  Talk to me, Danny!
DAN => Stay there. Don't get off the
PARKER => How bad is it?
DAN => It's bad. It's really fucking bad.  SOMEONE HELP US! PLEASE!
LYNCH => OK. Alright. You gotta stay
LYNCH => If we go to pieces we're never gonna get through this, OK?
LYNCH =>  Buddy, can you move at all?
DAN => I can't even stand up.
LYNCH => You can't, like...I don't know, slide down the hill or something?
DAN => My legs are shattered, asshole! I'm bleeding to death- NO, I CAN'T SLIDE DOWN THE FUCKING MOUNTAIN!
LYNCH => Alright, alright. Um...?
DAN => ...so much blood.
PARKER =>  Can you stop the bleeding?
DAN => With what?
PARKER => Here...
PARKER => SHIT!
LYNCH => Here you go, Dan.     I'm throwing mine down.
DAN => I can't see.
DAN => What do I do with this?
LYNCH => Tie it over your leg. Tie it off above wherever it's bleeding. Like a tourniquet thing.
DAN => I'm so cold.
PARKER => Here, take my coat.
DAN => No! Don't you take off your coat!
PARKER => No, I'll be OK. I can huddle next to Lynch. Please-
DAN => -Parker, keep your coat on.
DAN => Shit!
LYNCH => Dan, buddy. You gotta let us throw something down so you can stop the bleeding.
DAN => I...I've got it.
PARKER => Are you sure.
DAN => Yup.
LYNCH => Are you sure you can't try and get
LYNCH => Alright.   Hold on.
LYNCH => Maybe...if I could climb up to the lift cable? Maybe I could like, scale across to the other chairs until I find one that isn't quite so high up from the ground?
PARKER => You think you can pull yourself across that many chairs?
LYNCH => I can't even do a pull-up.
DAN => You never even tried to do a pull up you asshole. You had your Mom write you a note to get out of climbing the rope in gym cause you're a pussy.
LYNCH => There was no reason to embarrass myself. I knew I couldn't do it.
LYNCH => Even if I made it across to the
DAN => Every lift pole has an emergency
LYNCH => OK. The chair that's two back. Does it look like it's near the pole?
PARKER => I don't know. I can't see.
LYNCH => Shit, that's far.
LYNCH => Just.   Just give me a second.
PARKER => What if you fall, too?
LYNCH => Parker...if we just sit here, we're gonna freeze to death.
PARKER => Maybe...maybe in the morning someone else will come up here.
PARKER => We're right here, baby.
LYNCH => Yeah, man. We didn't go anywhere. I think...I think I'm gonna try and climb back to the pole. If the chair is close enough, maybe...
DAN => Do it.   Please do it now.
PARKER => Just hang in there, Dan.     It's gonna be OK.
LYNCH => It's funny. But I was never afraid of heights, until like...right now.
PARKER => What can I do to help?
LYNCH => Just hold on to my legs. You can't really stop me from falling...but it's, you know...psychological or something you know?
LYNCH => OK...OK...just give me a second.
PARKER => I think we should wait til morning. We can make it a few more hours.
LYNCH =>  Us? Maybe.  But not him.
PARKER => Baby, is that you?
DAN => What?
LYNCH => Shh!
DAN => Oh, motherfucker.
LYNCH => It's alright man. It's just a
LYNCH => Just relax. When's the last time you heard of a wolf attack in New England?
DAN => I read about one on-line somewhere last year. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
LYNCH => Wolves around here are pussies. They aren't even that big.
PARKER => It could be worse, right?
DAN => How the hell...could this be worse?
PARKER => It could be the Sarlacc Pit.
LYNCH => Parker- coming through with the
LYNCH => OK...here we go.
LYNCH => Holy shit, is that high up.
LYNCH => Nothing.   Just be quiet.
DAN => You can do this, Lynch.     You've got it.
LYNCH => Please stop talking.
LYNCH => Woa-! The whole back of this thing is ice.
LYNCH => Hold on, down there. I think once I can stand on the back- I should
DAN =>  You guys.
DAN =>  YOU GUYS!
PARKER => What?   What's wrong?
DAN => There's a wolf down here.
PARKER =>  Oh shit!
PARKER =>  GET AWAY FROM HIM!!!
LYNCH => Are you alright man?
LYNCH => See? What did I tell you? They're more scared of you than you are of them.
DAN => I don't know. I'm pretty scared, I gotta be honest.
LYNCH => It's just a dog. That's all it is.
PARKER => Are you keeping warm down there?
DAN => As warm as I can. 
LYNCH => No, no. You'll be alright.  That's probably really bad. I gotta move, so I need you to-
LYNCH => Hey...go like this.
PARKER => What?
LYNCH => Look at me- is my face changing color anywhere?
PARKER => I don't..I can't see anything.    I
PARKER => But it itches now...
LYNCH => I know- but if you keep touching your face it's gonna rub off.
LYNCH => Just try and cover your face.    Try and stay warm.
LYNCH => I'm trying man, I'm trying.
PARKER => Careful.
LYNCH => Stop talking.
DAN => Lynch.   I think the-
LYNCH => DAN, STOP TALKING.
LYNCH =>  I can do this. If Jenny Bluth could climb the rope, I can totally do this.
LYNCH => OK.    OK.   OK.
PARKER => Don't look down.
PARKER => Do you got it?
LYNCH => Shh.
PARKER => What's wrong?
LYNCH => Please no.     Please no...
DAN => Come on, Lynch! You had it!
PARKER => I got you.
PARKER => What's wrong?
PARKER => What happened?
LYNCH => Don't look down.
LYNCH => Don't look down there, Parker.
DAN => Lynch?   What's wro-
DAN => Oh shit.   Oh shit.
DAN =>  LYNCH.
DAN => 
LYNCH => I WON'T.
DAN => Don't let her look!
DAN => Don't look! Don't you fucking look down here!
LYNCH => I should...try and...
PARKER =>  Why did you let him jump?
LYNCH => You can't be fucking serious.
PARKER => It was too far.
LYNCH => He said he could do it. You didn't
LYNCH => You're his girlfriend! I didn't see you throwing yourself in front of him!
LYNCH => Oh, but he would have listened to me? I said it was a bad idea! I
PARKER => But you... You should have...
LYNCH => What?   Say it.
LYNCH => Say it!   It should have been me?
PARKER => I didn't say that.
PARKER => No, no, I-
LYNCH => You know what? If we hadn't spent the whole fucking day on the bunny slope watching you fall on your ass
PARKER => I'm sorry.
PARKER => That's not fair!
LYNCH => And it's not fair that my best friend is DEAD!
PARKER => I'm sorry! I didn't mean it!     I'm just- I'm just-
LYNCH => -Fuck you.
LYNCH =>  I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Parker.
PARKER => 429...
LYNCH => 5...5...shit, what was it?    5520? 5020?
PARKER => 5022.
LYNCH => 5022. 429-5022. I'm so gonna call that girl when we get home. And you know what? I'm gonna marry her. No messing around. I'm just gonna be like "Hey Shannon, it's me Joe from the chair lift. Will you marry me?" And then we're gonna get a house and have 2 kids and a dog named Steve.
PARKER => Who's gonna pay for the house.
LYNCH => She will.    Shannon's got a great
PARKER => What does she do.
PARKER => Orthodontists make a lot of money.
PARKER => I bet you guys will be really happy.
LYNCH => 429-5022.
PARKER => Who names their dog "Steve".
LYNCH => I will.
PARKER => Steve's a "people" name.
LYNCH => Says who?
PARKER => "Here, meet my cat Chris."
LYNCH => No cats.    Just a dog.   Steve.
PARKER => Shayna must be so hungry.
LYNCH => What kind of pizza should we get at Papa Gino's?
LYNCH => She won't starve to death and you're not going to die.
PARKER => No one else has a key to my place.
LYNCH => The neighbors will break the door down if she doesn't stop barking. Someone will figure it out. She'll be fine.
PARKER => I would have had Shayna for a year this month. I got her a year ago for Christmas.
LYNCH => I know.   But you'll see her again.
PARKER => Dan and I were spending Christmas with my parents this year. We won't be there though. 
carbine-action two-hundred-shot => range model air rifle that last time and they go back to their regular programming.  PARKER It's kind of sad because then you know you have to wait another year for Christmas again.  It's the same routine every year.  I just want to see my Mom and Dad.
PARKER => Uhh...
PARKER => Ruuugh!
PARKER => Shhhh.
LYNCH => I...thought I was dreaming.   This. I thought this was a dream.
PARKER => What?
LYNCH => Your frost-bite.   It's getting...worse.
PARKER => Really?    How bad is it?
LYNCH => Don't.    It's bad.
PARKER => It's not as itchy any more.
PARKER => You have some dark spots on your face, too.
LYNCH => They'll fix me, too then.   Just
PARKER => For what?
LYNCH => I don't know. Mountain maintenance. Besides, when none of us show up for class people are going to start looking for us.
PARKER => No one's gonna look for me. I skip class all the time. By the time anyone notices I'm gone I'll be dead.
LYNCH => Can you please just think ONE positive thing? Please!
PARKER => Besides.   No one knows we're here.
LYNCH =>  HEL-LO!!! WE NEED HELP!!      HELP!!!
LYNCH => Alright. Look. If I can get to that chair...two back...I could make it to the ladder on that pole. I think I could make it down.
LYNCH => Help me.
PARKER => Are you sure you don't just wanna give it a few more hours? What if you're right? What if someone is going to come up here, even though they're not open today?
LYNCH => UP HERE!   SOMEONE HELP US!
PARKER => I just wish I could stand up. Get out of this position for a minute.
LYNCH => If you want, you can stand on the chair and I can hold onto you.
PARKER => No.     I can't.
LYNCH => Well, if anything's gonna get you over your fear of heights, it's this.
PARKER =>  No. I'm fine.
LYNCH => Alright.
LYNCH => Hey...hey Parker...
LYNCH => Parker wake up.
LYNCH => Shit, I thought you stopped breathing...
PARKER => What's wrong?
LYNCH => Nothing.
LYNCH => How about you help me up again and we try and get out of here?
PARKER => Yeah.
LYNCH => OK.   1...2...3-
LYNCH => I feel like I gained about 100 pounds overnight.
PARKER => It was all that pizza talk.
LYNCH => I have no strength.
LYNCH => Damn it.
PARKER => Maybe later.
LYNCH => What? Like I'm gonna feel better if I wait a little longer? I should have done it last night while I still had some strength.
PARKER => There's more snow fall on the ground and it's all fresh. Maybe the jump won't be as bad now.
LYNCH => Even if it was a foot deeper- it
PARKER => What do you want me to do?
LYNCH => Nothing.   Let's sit and do nothing.
PARKER => AHHHH!
PARKER => How come you never have a girlfriend?
LYNCH => How am I supposed to answer that?
PARKER => I mean, you're a decent guy. Girls dig you. But you never stay in a relationship.
LYNCH => I had a serious girlfriend once.
PARKER => High School doesn't count.
PARKER => Who?
LYNCH => This girl Annie. I met her at orientation. We emailed all summer and when we started school, it was like we were already going out. I
LYNCH => She um... same favorite movie as me. E.T. It was like soul mates
PARKER => So then... what happened?
LYNCH => Same old shit.  No. You know what happened? She liked another guy. This fucking fraternity douchebag named Dean who kept sending her flowers and stuff. I don't know who it was exactly, but every time I'd go to her room some guy named "Dean" had left her notes and shit.
PARKER => Why did she keep it? Was she trying to make you jealous?
LYNCH => I don't know. I think she just liked getting attention.
PARKER => So she dumped you for a frat guy?
you." =>  So I turn around, and I'm like ready to kick the shit out of this guy. And all I see is a sea of fucking random people. Just all of these faces. This guy could see me and was making eyes with my
PARKER => That's messed up.
LYNCH => I've never felt so stupid and bad in my life.  So I left.
PARKER => You just walked out?
LYNCH => Yup. Told her to go laugh with "Dean the Frat guy". I was out.
PARKER => That sucks.
LYNCH => Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to walk out. Maybe I needed to have a thicker skin and not be such a sensitive bitch, I don't know. Sometimes I think I was just insecure and maybe I
PARKER => You should call her. When you get home. You could tell her that.
LYNCH => I can't.  She's dating Dean.
PARKER => I should have done something.
LYNCH => There was nothing either of us could have done.
PARKER => I sat here and let him die.
PARKER => He was the one. He was the boy I was gonna marry.
LYNCH => Funny story. First grade, we all get left there for the day by our mom's. You know, alone in real school for the first time without our folks around. And Dan... Dan was this sort of chubby kid when he was little...
LYNCH => Nah, fuck it. He was a fat ass.
LYNCH => And all the mom's left and he just wouldn't let go of his mom's hand. He just stood there after she left, at the front of the room, crying
PARKER => Sounds like Dan.
LYNCH => You have no idea. But then, the teacher... Mrs... What was her name? Mrs. Schifrin? She was trying everything to get the fat kid to stop crying. And so she
PARKER => And so he had to sit with you?
LYNCH => For a week! For my whole first week of school I'm sharing my little cubby desk with his fat ass!
LYNCH => Douchebag.     I never let him forget it.
PARKER => I loved him so much.
LYNCH => But if he died only for you and me to give up and die up here, that's bullshit.
PARKER => Yes.
LYNCH => So I need you to pull it together, and we're gonna get out of this shit. We're gonna get out of this
PARKER => Yes.
LYNCH => Help me up.
PARKER => Are you OK? Do you have it?
LYNCH => Rrruh!
PARKER => Oh my god!
PARKER => Joe!    JOE!
LYNCH => Shit!    Hold on, just hold on!
PARKER =>  Please God...please God....please God...
LYNCH => Rrrugh!
PARKER => You can do it. Please do it.
PARKER => JOE!
LYNCH =>  Got it.
LYNCH => Motherfucker.
LYNCH => I've got an audience.
PARKER => The chair is gonna fall!
LYNCH => No.    No it's not.
PARKER => You made it!
LYNCH => Not yet.   Halfway.
LYNCH => Please.
LYNCH => Parker. I want you to throw my extra pole as far as you can this way.
PARKER => What?
LYNCH => I said THROW MY POLE AS FAR AS YOU CAN THIS WAY. When I get on the ground I'll need some defense.
PARKER => Oh shit.
PARKER => Sorry.
LYNCH => Stay perfectly still. I'm gonna get you home, OK?
LYNCH => Rrrrugh!
PARKER =>  Please god, don't let me fall. Don't let me fall.
LYNCH => Shit.
PARKER => WHAT?
LYNCH => NOTHING.
PARKER => WHAT'S WRONG?
LYNCH => NOTHING.    I'M GONNA GO FOR IT, OK?
LYNCH =>  OK.
LYNCH => Yaaaaugh!
LYNCH => Rrrrugh!
PARKER => YOU DID IT! YOU DID IT!
PARKER => LYNCH!? LYNCH!!!  ANSWER ME!!!
LYNCH => PARKER.
PARKER => ARE YOU OK?
LYNCH => I'M GONNA GO GET HELP.       I'M GONNA GET RESCUE.
PARKER => Hurry.   Please.
PARKER => NO!   JOE!
LYNCH => I'M GONNA GET YOU HELP!
LYNCH => Come on!     Try something, fucker!
LYNCH => COME ON!
LYNCH => STAY AWAY!
LYNCH => ARGH!
PARKER =>  JOE!
LYNCH => AHHHHH!    STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME!
LYNCH => Parker, I'm gonna go get help! Don't move and I'll be back as fast as I can!
PARKER => OK.
LYNCH => Just don't move!     I'm getting help!
PARKER =>  Lynch.
PARKER => AHHHH!
PARKER =>  Joe...?
PARKER => Please.   Stop.
DRIVER => Hey!   Are you OK?!   Hello!
DRIVER => Lady.   Are you alright?
DRIVER => Hold on, hold on- we're gonna get you help...
DRIVER =>  I don't know. I found her laying in the road alone. Looks like she was in some sort of accident. Right outside of Mount Holliston. I'm taking her to you now.
DRIVER => Hold on, Ma'am. The hospital is 10 minutes away. You're gonna be OK.
DRIVER => You're gonna be OK.
DRIVER =>  You're gonna be OK, baby.
