BEFORE TITLES => The screen is black. First we hear the sound of a single trumpet playing slowly and sadly, the notes faintly resonant as if echoing through the narrow streets of some old hill village in Sicily. Now, confusingly, we see a slant of light move past us and another, and as our surroundings become more visible, we discover that we are moving through a pine forest lit by shafts of morning sunlight. Now,. suddenly, we come out of the trees and find ourselves on the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe.

TEE GROUP r n FONT OF EOQSE As the group breaks, Connie and the Housekeeper going back inside, Neri and Lampone drifting off, we pan up- ward to a window in the second-story and zoom in.
