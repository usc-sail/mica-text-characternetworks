Mardik Martin => Ethan Edwards
Bob Dylan => Subterranean Homesick Blues
ANNOUNCERS VOICE => Ladies and gentlemen, on the new tonight, the first actual motion pictures of death.
ANNOUNCERS VOICE => Watch closely, at the moment of death.
COLOR => CHARLES CAPPA JR.  is 25 of Sicilain origin.  He was educated in Roman Catholic Parochial schools with one year and a half at a Jesuit college.  CHARLIE was raised sternly in the Roman Catholic tradition but now has rejected many of the religion's tenets.  He is very intelligent and has a sharp sense of humor.  He is always well dressed.  His favorite authors are Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Hardy, and Theodore Dreiser.  He likes reading but enjoys films more. He is very fond of the New Testament and often exchanges quotes from it with his friend TONY.
TONY => What the fuck...hey!
TONY => Not in my fuckin' place... get out... get out!
TONY => And keep the fuck out-a-here.  I know your face.
TONY => And you scumbag...what did I tell you 'bout passin' that shit in my place  ...huh?
BOY => Hey I didn't do nothin'...cut it out...
MICHAEL => Hey, hurry up with that shit will ya.
MAN => What's this?  More shit...?
MICHAEL => Naw...that ain't shit...that's a German lens.
MICHAEL => A good buy...good two shipments of them.
MAN => Can't use it...
MICHAEL => Why...?  That's a telescopic one... it's good.
MAN => First, it ain't German...it's Japanese...and second, this ain't no lens...it's like a...a...an adaptor...so you got two shipments of Jap adaptors with no lenses. 
MICHAEL =>  A Jap adaptor?
CHARLIE =>  A...As you know, I've just come out of Confession.  And as a penance they gave me ten 'Hail Marys' and ten 'Our Fathers'...
CHARLIE =>  ...Now, between you and me... You know how I feel about such things... 'Hail Marys'...'Our Fathers'...No imagination...
CHARLIE =>  ...If I'm going to do penance at all, I'll do it the way I think it would be done...by me, that is...according to my own trespasses. You know what I mean.
GEORGE => It's ten o'clock and they're like this.  And they're just starting?
GEORGE =>  Smile...What are you smiling at? This is a business night.
TONY =>  George...did I ever tell you the story about the three chickens?
GEORGE =>  No...
TONY => Too bad.
CHARLIE => Y'know...she's really good-looking... really good-looking.  I've gotta say that again.  She's really good- looking...but she's black... You can see that real plain.  When you get down to it though... there's not much of a difference, is there?  Well...is there? (He smiles and begins chewing on an ice cube from his half empty glass)
CHARLIE => Oh great...hey - Winstons?
MICHAEL => For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
CHARLIE => OK, ok...
MICHAEL => Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
CHARLIE => No...I'll be ok for a week.
MICHAEL => You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
CHARLIE =>  Nope...
MICHAEL => Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
CHARLIE => Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
MICHAEL => I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
MICHAEL =>  ...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
CHARLIE =>  Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
MICHAEL => I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
CHARLIE =>  You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
MICHAEL => I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
CHARLIE => Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
MICHAEL =>  OK.
CHARLIE => What do you think?  'If a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them stray, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the mountains, and go in search of the one that has strayed?  And if he happen to find it, amen I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety- nine that did not go astray.  Even so, it is not the will of your Father in Heaven that a single one of these little ones should perish.'... Ok that's very nce but...
JOHNNY BOY => Drinks for everybody Tony...
CHARLIE =>  Giovanino!  Where have you been?
JOHNNY BOY =>  and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
TONY => Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
JOHNNY BOY => Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
TONY =>  Yeah, so things'll be even.
MICHAEL => How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
JOHNNY BOY =>  Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
JOHNNY BOY =>  I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
MICHAEL => You what?
CHARLIE =>  The queen!
ALL =>  The queen!
CHARLIE =>  What happened to you Flash?
JOHNNY BOY => Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
CHARLIE => I know but let's hear it anyway.
JOHNNY BOY => I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
SAL => Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
JOHNNY BOY => Sal!... fourteen street.
SAL => Come on.
JOHNNY BOY => This is some boat.  Your father's?
SAL => Yeah...just had it delivered...
JOHNNY BOY => Hey... you got stereo.
SAL => Yeah, I think so.
JOHNNY BOY => You got a speaker back there?
JOHNNY BOY =>  Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
SAL =>  I know...I know.
JOHNNY BOY => What'sa matter...forget your registration?
SAL => No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
JOHNNY BOY => Yeah, it's your father's.
SAL => Well...no.
JOHNNY BOY => You mean it's heisted.
SAL => You could say that.
JOHNNY BOY =>  This is a heisted car!
JOHNNY BOY => It's the truth, I swear.
CHARLIE => All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
TONY => Yeah, in the back.
TONY =>  C'mon, I got something to show you anyway.
GIRL =>  Jimmy, I tell you there's something in this room.
JIMMY =>  Ahhh come on baby...willya'...cut it out.
TONY => Excuse us Jimmy, we'll only be a moment.
TONY => S'alright Tony.
GIRL => I told you there was something in this room.
TONY => Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
CHARLIE => Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
TONY =>  Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
CHARLIE => Be careful.
CHARLIE => I'm surprised at you Tone.  I mean you've had the place for over a year now.  Nothing different...same old place...ordinary...flat...no imagination.
CHARLIE =>  For instance, the difference between me and you is this...you take that panther back there.  I'd put him right up here above the bar...nice cage, you know?  Nothing ordinary in my place.  What good is it?  You get robot customers.  They come in, drink beer, go to the bathroom, and go home.  No sir.
CHARLIE => See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
TONY =>  'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
JOHNNY BOY =>  Tony, break down and open another bottle willya'?
GEORGE => We're closed.
BOY => I'm just waiting for Joey.
DRUNK =>  I...I gotta go to the bathroom.
CHARLIE => Well, go ahead, whaddaya want? Someone to hold it for you?
CHARLIE =>  This place is dead. If I had a place...every night...lively.
CHARLIE =>  And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
TONY =>  You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
CHARLIE => Look who's talking.  Pretentious bullshit.  Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
JOHNNY BOY => Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
TONY => We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
CHARLIE => Don't forget what's-his-name there in the bathroom.
JIMMY => Wanna see your picture?
JIMMY => Waddaya think?
CHARLIE => Not quite...but keep trying.
CHARLIE => Let's have a game after we close.
JOHNNY BOY => Nah.
CHARLIE => C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
TONY => No.
CHARLIE =>  Anybody wanna have a game?
TONY => Don't run...don't run.  Everyone split up.
CHARLIE => Michael, give us a lift.
MICHAEL => OK, get in.
BENTON => Michael...wait.
MICHAEL => Get in, get in.
CHARLIE => Oh Jesus Christ...what's this.
BENTON => Sammy get control of yourself.
JOHNNY BOY => Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
CHARLIE => Should I slap him?
SAMMY =>  You wouldn't dare.
BENTON => I'm terribly sorry guys...It's just that he was terribly frightened.
MICHAEL => Just keep him quiet.
JOHNNY BOY => Friends of yours Michael.
MICHAEL => Shut up.
BENTON =>  Oh...ah...I'm Benton and this is Sammy.
CHARLIE => I can't get over the way he just kept going at him.
JOHNNY BOY => Must have been all the liquor in him.
MICHAEL =>  Quiet please.
MICHAEL => Where should I drop you Charlie?
SAMMY =>  Yes Charlie, your place or mine.
BENTON => Sammy.
CHARLIE => Away from the neighborhood.
SAMMY => Oh Benton...look!
SAMMY =>  Hi beautiful!!!  I love you.
MICHAEL => Hey, shut up.
CHARLIE => Get him in.
JOHNNY BOY => What...are you kidding.
BENTON => Sammy, get in here this minute.
SAMMY => I won't...I won't!  They're all beautiful.  I'll suck them all...I'll suck them all!
CHARLIE => Disgraceful.
MICHAEL => Ok...that's it.
MICHAEL => Out!!!!
CHARLIE => C'mon Johnny.
MICHAEL => You getting out too?
CHARLIE => Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
SAMMY =>  Going our way?
CHARLIE =>  Don't answer.
JOHNNY BOY => I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
CHARLIE => No, she isn't.
CHARLIE => Listen, I'll be ok...it's the best thing.  You're not going to be able to take care of Grandma out here and still get to work, you know that...  Yes the place will be here, I'll take care of it.  Yeah don't worry about me, I'll take care of myself. 
CHARLIE =>  No...no parties.  I'll eat.  Mom, look, just don't worry...ok?
CHARLIE => You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
JOHNNY BOY => Wouldn't bother me.
CHARLIE => Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
JOHNNY BOY => Don't worry.  I can handle it.
CHARLIE => You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.
JOHNNY BOY =>  There won't be any this week.
CHARLIE => What do you mean?
JOHNNY BOY => Didn't show up.
CHARLIE => You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
JOHNNY BOY => I don't like loading crates.
CHARLIE => You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
JOHNNY BOY => What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
CHARLIE => I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
JOHNNY BOY => Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
CHARLIE => Don't promise...just deliver.
JOHNNY BOY => Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
CHARLIE => I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
JOHNNY BOY =>  Listen...I'm a guest here.
JOHNNY BOY => OK...ok...I'm going.
JOHNNY BOY => Hey...you got nothing here.
CHARLIE =>  I could have told you that.
JOHNNY BOY => We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
CHARLIE => Don't do that.  You'll scare Teresa if you try to sneak in.
JOHNNY BOY => Yeah...you're right.  Maybe she'll have a seizure and we can watch.
CHARLIE => That's not funny.  You gonna be a jerk-off all your life.  Grow up. You want something to eat from your aunt's house you go knock on her door, understand?
JOHNNY BOY => I'm not hungry anymore.  I'm going to bed.
JOHNNY BOY =>  Hello...fifth precinct?  Yeah...I want to report a disturbance.  Yeah this man and woman next door are disturbing the peace.  They're keeping me awake all night now. What the hell is this.  What? Well... yelling, fighting, throwing things.  Uh-huh.  If they don't kill each other soon I'm goin' over there and do the job myself.  Yes - the address is 270 Mott street.  I think it's apartment 2-r.  Yeah, right... thanks.  Look, I demand immediate action.  Never mind my name I don't like getting involved in things like this.
TERESA => I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
CHARLIE => Ok, we'll go for lunch.
TERESA => Do you have enough?
CHARLIE => Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
TERESA => Here.
TERESA => Please take it.
CHARLIE => Well...
TERESA => I don't mind.
CHARLIE => Sure...it's not that...I mean...
TERESA =>  It's all right.
CHARLIE => Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
TERESA => An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
CHARLIE => Maybe, who knows.
TERESA =>  Charlie...?
CHARLIE => Nobody knows anything, believe me.
CHARLIE => See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
TERESA => Anything specific?
CHARLIE => You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
TERESA =>  What is it now?
CHARLIE => Don't ask.
TERESA => Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
CHARLIE => Did you?
TERESA => No.
CHARLIE => CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
TERESA => It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
CHARLIE => You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
TERESA => It's still sick.
CHARLIE => Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
TERESA => You're sure he doesn't know.
CHARLIE => Don't worry.
CHARLIE =>  Don't look at me like that, I can see this is not going to get us anywhere.  She's a good kid, what am I supposed to do.  In a way I'm doing her a favor...no???  How many guys you know feel this way about an epileptic?  Don't get me wrong, I'm no saint...not yet.
CHARLIE =>  But I'm not like the Pharisee who said "Oh God I thank thee that I am not like the rest of them."...no...I like to think of myself as the Publican...
CHARLIE => ...'Oh God be merciful to me the sinner!' I'm not taking advantage of her.  I swear to you that if she meets someone she'd like to marry...
CHARLIE =>  ...I'll cut out. "If Thy eye is an occasion of sin to thee...
CHARLIE => ...pluck it out and cast it from thee." "Woe to the man through whom scandal does come." I'm sure you'd agree this is no time to get tied down.  Like the priesthood...
CHARLIE => ...they don't get tied down do they? "Have I not a right to do what I chose?  Even so the last shall be first and the...
CHARLIE => ...first last.  For many are called but few are chosen."
OSCAR =>  Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
CHARLIE => Ok, how's everything going?
OSCAR => Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
CHARLIE => No.
OSCAR => I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
CHARLIE =>  What pipes?
OSCAR =>  What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
OSCAR => Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
CHARLIE => That bad, huh?
OSCAR => I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
CHARLIE => Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
OSCAR => Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
CHARLIE => He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
OSCAR => Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
CHARLIE => I don't understand, where's Groppi?
OSCAR => I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
CHARLIE => My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
OSCAR => What can I say?
CHARLIE =>  Is my uncle back there?
REPAIR MAN => Yeah, but I think he's busy now. Hey Charlie play 463 today - for sure.
CHARLIE => Thanks!
OLD MAN =>  What I'm telling you is that he did it for Mario's honor.
MARIO => But you don't understand.  I knew the kid.  He was drunk.  He made of fool of himself...not me.
OLD MAN =>  Giovanni - an insult to Mario is an insult to you.
MARIO => There was no insult.
OLD MAN =>  The boy only did what was right.
GIOVANNI => Your son only did what was stupid. We have enough down here without something like that.  And what for? ...Nothing...no reason.  Protect him?  Why?  I didn't tell him to do anything for me.  He's going to Miami?  Good...keep him in Miami for six months...a year...a good long time.  After everything's forgotten then I see what I can do for him.  Right now...keep him away.
CHARLIE => Marie, are there Columbian coffee beans in this coffee?
MARIE => I dunno.
CHARLIE => Just a second.  Let me taste it.
CHARLIE => Yes, I'd say there are some Columbian coffee beans in this coffee, but only about 39%.
CHARLIE => You see.  You probably don't notice this Marie, but Colombian coffee beans are rich coffee beans. Bursting with that good, deep coffee flavor.  Picked when they are ripe to the point of perfection. The beans of course, are protected by the tall South American Guama trees.
CHARLIE => Then the bean pickers come down and pick each bean by hand.  Bean by bean, all heavy with flavor.  And they load them into boxes, one box at a time, box by box.
CHARLIE =>  Like, looking at my uncle back there.  One way is the obvious; ...man outside the law.  On the other hand, instead of a breakdown of order there is a creation of order and instead of the breakdown of law, there is the creation of law...In this society which needs new law because 'What's a crowbar compared to a share of stock. What's the robbing of a bank compared to the founding of one and what's the murder of a man to the gainful employment of that man.' 'Do not think that I have come to destroy the Law or the Prophets.  I have not come to destroy but to fulfill.' ...Amen.
CHARLIE => Uncle, how are you feeling?
GIOVANNI => Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
CHARLIE =>  About that shooting last night...I was there and...
GIOVANNI => No you weren't.
CHARLIE =>  You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
GIOVANNI => Yes, you did.
CHARLIE => About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
GIOVANNI => No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
CHARLIE => Yes...I understand...I'll be careful.
TERESA => C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
CHARLIE => No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
TERESA => Ok.
CHARLIE => Bore.
TERESA => A paper on that one too?
CHARLIE => Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
TERESA => It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
CHARLIE => Take your time.  I don't care.
TERESA => I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
CHARLIE => That's the word...preoccupied.
CHARLIE => Let's go back inside.
CHARLIE => See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
TERESA => Sure...He lives there?
CHARLIE => No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
CHARLIE => That W.A.S.P. bastard.
TERESA => You're intolerable today.
CHARLIE => Watch your language.
TERESA => I like it here...alone.
TERESA => I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
CHARLIE => Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
TERESA => You know why...with my parents.
CHARLIE => Well you can't blame them in a way.
TERESA =>  I can take care of myself.  You know that.
CHARLIE => I know...I know.
TERESA'S MOTHER => Turridu...that's your boy Charles. Don't you know him.  Isn't that Charles?
TERESA'S MOTHER =>  Who is that?
CHARLIE'S FATHER => Che Guevara.
CHARLIE => ...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
TERESA => Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
CHARLIE => Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
TERESA => I'm sleepy.
CHARLIE => You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
TERESA => The green capsules in the top drawer.
GROPPI => What do you want kid?
GROPPI => What do you want?.......well?
CHARLIE => I...I'm selling encyclopedias...er a magazines...newspapers...I'm conducting a survey...I...
GROPPI => We don't want no fuckin' books!
BOY => There's nobody here mister.
CHARLIE => Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
BOY => Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
CHARLIE => Know where he is?
BOY => Follow me.
CHARLIE => How much farther?
CHARLIE =>  Now, don't get excited.
CHARLIE =>  'The stone which the builders' reject will become the cornerstone'...I think.
GIOVANNI => Play it again!!!
EVERYONE => One more time...play it again...
GIOVANNI =>  Take a drink!
CHARLIE =>  Ok.
GIOVANNI => Hey, where you been?
CHARLIE =>  Oh...around...why?
GIOVANNI =>  You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
CHARLIE =>  Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
GIOVANNI =>  Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
GIOVANNI =>  ...he walks into his mother's room where she's watching television...and he says to her...
GIOVANNI => ...that he's sorry.
OLD WOMAN => It's all right.
GIOVANNI =>  ...he goes in the next room...
GIOVANNI =>  ...he takes a gun and puts it in his mouth and...
GIOVANNI =>  ...so...
GIOVANNI =>  How do you like that, eh?  He was always a little crazy, y'know... Groppi... a little crazy.
CHARLIE =>  Not now...in a few minutes...ok?
MICHAEL => I gave him all the breaks I can give.
CHARLIE => Oh Michael, look...
MICHAEL => Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
CHARLIE => Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
MICHAEL => All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
CHARLIE => We'll settle it tonight.
BOY #1 => Hey, you sell firecrackers?
CHARLIE => Firecrackers!  No...no.
BOY #1 => You know where we can get some?
CHARLIE => Sure, see that guy over there...
CHARLIE =>  ...him.  He's got the best.
BOY #1 => Hey - fella...you sell firecrackers?
MICHAEL => Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
BOY #2 => Well the guy over there said...
MICHAEL =>  Yeah, yeah, never mind.  You gotta be careful.
BOY #1 => We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
MICHAEL => Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
BOY #2 => Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
MICHAEL =>  All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
BOY #1 => Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
MICHAEL => Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
BOY #2 => Well, we want good stuff.
MICHAEL => Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
BOY #1 => No.
MICHAEL => That means it's good.
BOY #1 => You got sparklers?
MICHAEL => Yeah.
BOY #2 => And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
MICHAEL => Ok.  For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
BOY #1 => No, all we got is $40.
MICHAEL => You sure?
BOYS => Yeah.
MICHAEL => Ok.  Wait here.
MICHAEL =>  C'mon.  Get in the car.
MICHAEL => Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
BOYS => Why?
MICHAEL => I gotta get the stuff.
BOYS => Can't we come with you?
MICHAEL => Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business.  I'll be back in thirty minutes.
MICHAEL => Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
BOYS => Uh...can we give you a check?
MICHAEL => A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
BOY #1 => Riverdale.
MICHAEL =>  Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
MICHAEL => Ok.  Now wait here...and keep your mouths shut!
TONY => How much?
MICHAEL => Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
TONY => Can you spare it?
MICHAEL => Sure.
TONY =>  Thanks.
TONY => Hey Charlie.  Get in.
CHARLIE => What's a'matter?
MICHAEL => Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
CHARLIE => How much?
MICHAEL => $20.
CHARLIE => Let's go to the movies...on you.
TONY => Yeah.
MICHAEL => Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
CHARLIE =>  You know damn well what's going to happen tonight.  I'll probably get drunk at that party...it isn't every day you send one of your best friends off to war for God and country... gotta have a party.  I mean, he's a nice kid.
CHARLIE =>  I don't know what You think of him but that's between You and him anyway...I can't help feeling sorry for him though.  Has a talent but doesn't use it...His brain.  An 'Unprofitable servant who shall be cast forth into the darkness outside, where there will be...
CHARLIE =>  ...the weeping and the gnashing of teeth'...or something like that. My talent's my brain too but I use my talent...I'm not saying that I'm a genius...You'll probably be the first one to agree on that, but I can tell the difference between the intelligent and the stupid.  Take the army for example...
CHARLIE =>  That's there and I'm here and that's the way it's going to stay!
TERESA => Oh sure!  I know her Michael...In fact, I saw her a few days ago under a bridge in Jersey, making out with a nigger.
MICHAEL => You sure?...a nigger...Uh!...and I kissed her.
TONY =>  Hallelujah!!
CHARLIE => I have come to create order... Scotch and water please.
CHARLIE => May God be with you.
TONY => 'And with your spirit.'
CHARLIE =>  Salute!!!
TONY =>  'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
CHARLIE => 'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
TONY => 'Am I a Jew?  Thy own people and the chief priests have delivered thee to me.  What hast thou done?'
CHARLIE => 'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
TONY => 'Thou art then a king?'
CHARLIE => 'Thou sayest it; I am a king.  This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
TONY => 'What is the truth?'
TONY => Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
CHARLIE => I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
CHARLIE => He said he'd be here.
MICHAEL => Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
CHARLIE => He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
MICHAEL => You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
CHARLIE =>  How much was the original loan again?
MICHAEL => $500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
CHARLIE => $3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
MICHAEL => Charlie, this is business.
CHARLIE =>  'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
MICHAEL => I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
CHARLIE =>  'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
MICHAEL =>  He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
CHARLIE =>  'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
MICHAEL => You said it.
EVERYONE => Blasphemy!...The anti-Christ! Crucify him!!
CHARLIE => 'Father...forgive them...for they know not...what they do...'
TERESA => Charlie...?  Charlie here...?
TERESA =>  The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
CHARLIE => Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
FRIENDS => Charlie, stay there...He's crazy... He's got a 22.
CHARLIE => Johnny it's me, Charlie.
JOHNNY BOY => Don't come any closer!!!
CHARLIE => Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
JOHNNY BOY => Charlie...pssst.  Over here.
CHARLIE => What are you...crazy?
JOHNNY BOY => Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
CHARLIE => Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
JOHNNY BOY => Watch this.
CHARLIE => What the fuck...
CHARLIE => Let's get out of here.
JOHNNY BOY =>  Did you see them run!
JOHNNY BOY => I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
CHARLIE =>  That's not going to help.
JOHNNY BOY => I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
CHARLIE => It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
JOHNNY BOY => I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
CHARLIE => Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
JOHNNY BOY => Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
CHARLIE => How?
JOHNNY BOY =>  If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
CHARLIE => That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
CHARLIE => I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
JOHNNY BOY => Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
CHARLIE => That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
JOHNNY BOY => I understand.
CHARLIE => 'Could you not, then, watch one hour with me?'
CHARLIE => 'The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.'
OSCAR => Put the menus away.  I, personally do the cooking tonight.
GIOVANNI => Fine...that's why I'm here.
MARIO => Calamari?
OSCAR => Capozelle, Calamari...anything you want...
GIOVANNI =>  Drink.
OSCAR => Giovanni...er...can I talk?
OSCAR => About the place, Giovanni...
GIOVANNI => ...I know all about it.  We'll discuss it later.
OSCAR =>  Our arrangements about the place haven't changed, have they?  I mean...
GIOVANNI =>  No, no, not at all...look, we leave it the way it is for now, we talk later, understand?
OSCAR =>  Sure, Giovanni...I understand. I'll bring the clams now.
CHARLIE => I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
GIOVANNI => Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
CHARLIE => Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
GIOVANNI =>  You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
CHARLIE => Wasn't a book...was a short story.
MARIO => What was it?
CHARLIE =>  Nothing.
MARIO => No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
CHARLIE =>  "Francis Macomber."
MARIO => Wha?
CHARLIE =>  "Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
MARIO => Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
GIOVANNI => Yeh, Mario over here, he reads a lot.
GIOVANNI => Surprised?
MARIO => I like this Harold Robbins...
CHARLIE =>  Oh yes, he's pretty good.
GIOVANNI => What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
CHARLIE => It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
MARIO => Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
GIOVANNI => What Mario's trying to tell you, Charlie, is that you're wasting your time with those "couple of courses" ...you don't need them. There are a lot of things that can be taken care of...you know what I mean?
GIOVANNI => These politicians...they talk nice.
GIOVANNI =>  ...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
CHARLIE => What did he do?
GIOVANNI => What did he do?  He was there... that's what he did.
MARIO => In the fifties when the communists started in with this country and they tried to clean them out, we offered to do it for them...but they didn't want us to...so we kept out of it.
GIOVANNI =>  I told this...the same thing to your father thirty years ago...I told him what to do...but he didn't listen.
GIOVANNI => You're still around with that kid Johnny Boy...last night with that gun...Don't get mixed up with them. This Johnny Boy, you know, he's named after me...  nice, eh?  This Johnny Boy is like your mister Groppi...a little crazy. It's nice you should help him out because of his family and our family but watch yourself...Don't spoil anything.
GIOVANNI =>  His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
CHARLIE => Teresa.
GIOVANNI => ...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
CHARLIE => No, she's got epilepsy.
GIOVANNI => Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
GIOVANNI => Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
CHARLIE => What do they expect you to say?
GIOVANNI => Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
CHARLIE => All right.
MARIO => Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
CHARLIE => Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
GIOVANNI => Well, maybe you missed something?
CHARLIE =>  Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
CHARLIE =>  ...looks good...things look good, if I may say so myself.  Don't you agree?  Unless there's something You know that I don't know?
COOK => Hi Charlie.
COOK =>  Man, it's hot as Hell in here, every day like going through Hell in here.
CHARLIE =>  Hot as hell...You're not the only one going through Hell kid.
COOK => Maybe so...but at this pay it ain't worth it...that much I can tell you.
CHARLIE =>  'If thy hand is an occasion of sin to thee, cut it off.  It is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire. 'Where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched.'
TONY => Is it near Sullivan Street?
JIMMY => No - by Bedford.
TONY => Oh - you gotta show me.  I always get lost in the village.
CHARLIE => Next time, bet with your own kind.
JIMMY => The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
CHARLIE => It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
JIMMY => I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
JOHNNY BOY => Yeah, yeah - enough.
JOEY => Hello Charlie, you canonized yet?
CHARLIE => No - not yet - just blessed.
JIMMY => On Friday, the 25th--I placed it with Sally--
JOEY =>  I never heard of it.
CHARLIE => Oh Joey, really...we're all friends here--let's cut the bullshit.
JOEY =>  ...Well...  you got a good friend here--come to think of it, I do remember now.
JOHNNY BOY =>  Scumbag--
TONY =>   Shut up.
JOEY =>  Well, Friday's are busy--a mistake can be made y'know.  Have another drink.
CHARLIE => Whatever, just lets settle this and it's all forgotten.
JOHNNY BOY => I don't forget nothin.
JOHNNY BOY => Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
JOEY => The girls like it loud.
JOHNNY BOY => Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!
JOEY =>  What's the matter with this kid?
JOHNNY BOY => I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
CHARLIE => Keep your mouth shut.
JOHNNY BOY => You tell me that in front of these creeps?
JOEY => We won't pay...
JIMMY => Why?  We just said...
JOHNNY BOY =>  We won't pay...because this guy  is a...mook.
JIMMY => But I didn't say nothin.
JOEY =>  We don't pay mooks!
JIMMY =>  A mook...I'm a mook...  What's a mook?
JIMMY => You can't call me a mook!
JOEY => We were gonna pay you Jimmy, we just don't like being moved in on.
CHARLIE => C'mon -- I'm movin' in on you? Let's have another drink and forget about it.
JOEY => Don't count it...it's all there.
JOHNNY BOY =>  Count it.
JOEY => Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
JOHNNY BOY => Don't fuckin' touch me - scumbag.
CHARLIE => Shut up stupid.
CHARLIE => You got some mouth!
JIMMY => Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
JOHNNY BOY =>  What're ya hollering?  You got your money.
TONY =>  Fuck youse all.
CHARLIE => You got no honor Tony.  Charge!
CHARLIE => No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
BOY => Thanks.
CHARLIE => What are your plans?
BOY => Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
CHARLIE => Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
BOY => Sounds good.
CHARLIE => Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
CHARLIE => Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
TERESA => Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
CHARLIE => Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
TERESA => But...
CHARLIE => I'll see you later.
CHARLIE => Diane, how are you feeling?
DIANE =>  Fine.
CHARLIE => You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
DIANE => Fine.
CHARLIE => No, I'm serious...You're really good.
DIANE => I know.
CHARLIE => In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
DIANE => That's nice.
CHARLIE => I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
DIANE => Stripper?
CHARLIE => No...no stripping...as the hostess.
DIANE => Hostess?
CHARLIE => Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
DIANE => Chinese food?
CHARLIE => Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
DIANE => Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
CHARLIE => Bye.
MICHAEL => Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
CHARLIE => We'll be here.
MICHAEL => I tell you, Charlie.  If that kid doesn't show up tonight...
MICHAEL => ...I'm gonna find him, drag him down here, tie one of his legs to that Ford bumper over here...
MICHAEL => ...and his other leg to that Chrysler over there.
MICHAEL => ...and bam!!!
CHARLIE => Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
MICHAEL => Whatever.
CHARLIE => Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
TERESA => For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
CHARLIE =>  ...that sonofabitch.
TERESA => But Charlie...it's uptown and it's perfect.  It's big enough for two people...she's going to get out by the end of the month.  If you don't act right away, it'll go in no time. What do you think?
TERESA => Don't you realize what that apartment means?
TERESA => Do you?  For both of us.  Think... after a while you might even be able to move in yourself.
CHARLIE => Are you serious?  Me move in with you.  You crazy?
CHARLIE =>  Teresa, get these ideas out of your head...I've got enough on my hands right now...with that bastard cousin of yours.  You wanna move? Go ahead.  By all means!  But keep me out of it...I've got nothing to do with it...you understand...nothing.
CHARLIE => Where were you?  Answer me, you sonofabitch!  Where were you?
CHARLIE =>  Shut up!
JOHNNY BOY =>  Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
CHARLIE => You had me going crazy!
CHARLIE => Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
JOHNNY BOY => Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
JOHNNY BOY =>  Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
CHARLIE => Don't be smart.
JOHNNY BOY => I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
JOHNNY BOY => Don't be upset Teresa.  You have to understand Charlie, here...he gives of himself to help others...
TERESA => I'm going to go home.
JOHNNY BOY => No, you stay.
CHARLIE => Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
JOHNNY BOY =>  Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
JOHNNY BOY =>  Charlie...I always wondered about her...what happens when she comes? Does she get one of those fits?  Eh? That would be something to see...
JOHNNY BOY => You rat bastard!!  Don't hit me again!!
JOHNNY BOY => I think I will fuckin go see your uncle right now...he'd be interested.
CHARLIE => Go ahead!  Go on!  And we'll see what happens to you without me.
TERESA => No...no...don't.
CHARLIE => What do I do?  You know anything about this?
JOHNNY BOY => I don't know...she's your girl...I gotta go.
JOHNNY BOY => Hate to miss the floor show, though.
CHARLIE => You crazy bastard!  What are you trying to do, ruin me?
CHARLIE => You...
CHARLIE => You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
JOHNNY BOY => What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
CHARLIE => Then don't show up tonight and see what happens.
CHARLIE => How much have you got for Michael tonight?
JOHNNY BOY => I only got eight bucks on me.
CHARLIE => Here, take twenty bucks.  With your eight that makes twenty-eight bucks you give Michael.  I keep the thirteen for the weekend.  Maybe we'll eat some Chinese food later.
CHARLIE => Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
JOHNNY BOY => No you're not...
CHARLIE => Oh, cut it out, will ya?
JOHNNY BOY => Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
CHARLIE => NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
JOHNNY BOY => No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
CHARLIE => Come on.
TONY => You're over an hour late.  Michael said he'll be back later, though...
CHARLIE => Watch this kid for me.  I have to go someplace but I'll be back soon to get Michael and him together. Don't even let him go to the bathroom.
CHARLIE => Don't you move!!!
JOHNNY BOY =>  I'll be here.  Don't worry.
CHARLIE => 6th Avenue and Waverly Place, fast please.
CAB DRIVER => Where do you want me to stop?
CHARLIE => No...don't stop...just pass real slow, OK?
CHARLIE => Stop here.  No...what am I...crazy???  Take me back to where you picked me up.
CAB DRIVER =>  Ok.
JOHNNY BOY => Back so soon.
CHARLIE => Mind your own business.
TERESA => Hey, cut it out.  Will ya?
CHARLIE =>  You can see things aren't going too well for me at the moment.  My willpower and powers of persuasion are not what they usually are today. My ability to control events and situations are wanting.  I know.  I know...what can I say...I offer this as part of my penance.
CHARLIE =>  Who's the girl?
TONY => Jewish...
CHARLIE => How do you know?
TONY => Look at her.
CHARLIE => She don't look Jewish.
TONY => Sure she is.  She's always in here with some different guy.  You know the way they are.
CHARLIE => I love you.
CHARLIE =>  Ever since that first day I saw you at the convent with the nuns, playing volleyball, I couldn't help myself.
GIRL => You Italian?
CHARLIE => Yeah why?
GIRL => You don't look it.
GIRL =>  Fuck off.
BOY =>  What do you mean?  ...let's go.
GIRL => You go...I'm staying.
BOY => Let's go!
CHARLIE => It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
BOY => Look fella...this is private...
CHARLIE => Nothing's private...
GIRL => I'd like to leave.
CHARLIE => Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
BOY => Let go of her.
GIRL => Stop it...you're hurting me.
CHARLIE => Take her away from me...I mean physically take her away from me.
MICHAEL => What's it gonna be?  I was here tonight...you kept me waiting for over an hour.
JOHNNY BOY => Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
CHARLIE => He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
MICHAEL => Better than nothing.
MICHAEL => Where's the rest?
CHARLIE => Yeah, where's the rest?
JOHNNY BOY => I bought a few rounds of drinks while waiting.
MICHAEL =>  Twenty-eight bucks is enough of an insult...I was gonna take the twenty-eight bucks because of Charlie here...but ten bucks!
JOHNNY BOY => You make me laugh, Michael...you know that?  I've borrowed money all over the neighborhood and never paid it back...so I couldn't borrow anymore from them...so who's the only jerk off left that I can borrow from without paying back...YOU.  Because that's what I think of you...Jerk off.  I fuck you where you breathe!
CHARLIE =>  You're really crazy.
MICHAEL => You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
MICHAEL => You don't have the guts to use that...be seeing you Charlie, Tony, and of course you John...be seeing you.
CHARLIE => You stupid bastard!  Never pull a gun unless you intend to use it.
TONY =>  ...No bullets in it.
TONY => Get out of here before this really goes up.
CHARLIE => Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
TONY =>  Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
JOHNNY BOY => I think we should see your uncle.
CHARLIE => No.
JOHNNY BOY => This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
CHARLIE => Forget it.
JOHNNY BOY => What are you going to do?  Hide me?
CHARLIE => Good idea.
CHARLIE =>  I guess you could safely say that this evening has been so far very unimpressive as far as my efforts are concerned...more unproductive. Now, I'd like to know what you do, for an encore, Lord?  I know penance is penance but this is something else.
JOHNNY BOY => What are you talking to yourself???
CHARLIE =>  Go ahead!  Play the radio...play music...you're going to a party... louder!  Go ahead.  Louder.  A party.  Lots of fun.
CHARLIE => Hey, what is this guy, crazy?
VOICE => Now, now's the time!
SINGERS => Good night...Good night...thank you...good night!
CHARLIE => My uncle didn't come?
MARIO =>  Giovanni says now he done enough. He got you outta jail.  Now...  he wants you outta the way.
MARIO => He says use it.  Don't sell it.  He says he'll see you.  Someday.  Maybe.
MARIO =>  Things worked out rotten kid.  Sorry.
TONY => Where to?
CHARLIE =>  Kennedy.
TONY =>  I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
CHARLIE => It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
TONY => So?
CHARLIE =>  So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
TONY => Nervous?
CHARLIE => Yeah.
TONY => You flew before?
CHARLIE => No.
CHARLIE =>  Hey, come on...
TONY => Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
CHARLIE => Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
TONY => How about Teresa?  I could talk...
CHARLIE =>  Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
TONY => And say what?
CHARLIE => I'll say that I'm travelling.
TONY => Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
CHARLIE =>  Thanks for the ride.
CHARLIE => Take care of that tiger.
TONY =>  Panther...
CHARLIE => Panther!  Same thing...
TONY => Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
CHARLIE => Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
TONY =>  Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
TONY => See you.
CHARLIE => I don't know what to say to you...
CLERK => May I help you?
CLERK => Sir, may I help you?
CHARLIE =>  Where can I go?
