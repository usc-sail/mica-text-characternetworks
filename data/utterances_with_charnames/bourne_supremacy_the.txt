MARIE => Where were you, Jason?
BOURNE => In the car.         Conklin up front.
MARIE => I'll get the book.
BOURNE => No.    There's nothing new.
MARIE => You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
BOURNE => Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --               *
MARIE => -- it hasn't been two years --                            *
BOURNE => -- it's alwa   ys bad and it's    never                   * anything but    bits and piece   s anyway!                * * You ever thi   nk that maybe i   t's just                 * making it wo   rse? You don't     wonder that?            *
MARIE => We write them down because sooner or                      * later you're going to remember something                  * good.                                                     *
BOURNE =>  I do remember something good.       All the time. I remember you.
BOURNE => I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
MARIE => I worry when you get like this.
BOURNE => It's just a nightmare.
MARIE => I don't mean that.   I worry when you try to ignore it.
MARIE => Sleep.   Sleep now.
BOURNE => I should be better by now.
MARIE => You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
BOURNE => But it ends up the same.
MARIE => One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
BACK TO => BOURNE slowing as he reaches the corner --
MR. MOHAN => And your question, sir?
KIRILL => She's my sister. There's been a death in the family. This is the last place we know she called from.
18   * => Crowded with tourists -- sunbathers -- MARIE at her favorite spot. Talking with TWO WOMEN, laughing with them - - happy.
BOURNE => We gotta go, Marie.       We gotta go, now.
BOURNE => We're blown.
MARIE => No...     How?
BOURNE => The Telegraph office.
MARIE => But we were so careful.
BOURNE => We pushed it. We got lazy.                                 *
MARIE => But you're sure?
BOURNE => He was at the campground yesterday.
MARIE => So...                                                  *
BOURNE => It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and                  * hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
MARIE => That's crazy.                                          *
BOURNE => No.  Not thi   s. This is real.                        * * And he's rig   ht there...                             * (throw   ing the car into rever   se)

PAMELA => I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved.                * 
PAMELA => And that wha   tever information I was going            * to buy in Be   rlin, it was big enough to               * make Bourne    come out from wherever he's              * been hiding    to kill again.                           * * How's that s   can?                                     *

NEVINS => Okay, I'll call you right back.

PAMELA/TAPE => "Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous..."
PAMELA/TAPE =>  "...a week ago he assassinated two men in Berlin, one a highly..."
CRONIN => So your cover at the time was what?
NICKY => That I was an American student in Paris.
CRONIN => What exactly did your job with Treadstone in Paris consist of?
NICKY => Ih    ad two re   sponsibilities. One was     to coo   rdinate l   ogistical operations. Th    e oth   er was to    monitor the health of th   e age   nts, to m   ake sure they were up to    date wit   h their m   edications.
CRONIN => Health, meaning what?
NICKY => Their mental health.       Because of what they'd been through.       They were prone to a variety of problems.
PAMELA => * What kind of problems?
NICKY => Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
PAMELA                                   * => Amnesia?                                                   *
NICKY => Before this?        Before Bourne?   No.
ABBOTT => Were you familiar with the training program?
NICKY => The details? No. I mean,         I was told it was voluntary. I don't kno       w if that's true or not, but that's wha      t I was told.  Look, they took vulnerable       subjects, okay? You mix that with th       e right pharmacology and some serio      us behavior modification, and, I don't       know, I mean, I guess anything's possible      .
ZORN                                     * => The jet's ready.                                     * * There's a car for you.                               *

PAMELA                                   * => You were his local contact. You were                 * with him the night Conklin died. You're              * coming with us.                                      *
PAMELA                             * => I'm    curious    about Bourne.     Your             * You    have spe   cific training    in the ide   ntificati   on and diagnosi   s of psy   chologica   l conditions?
NICKY => Am I a doctor, no, but...
PAMELA => Are you an expert in amnesia?
NICKY => Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
PAMELA => Believed what?
NICKY => I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
PAMELA => So he fooled you.
NICKY =>  If you say so.                                       *
PAMELA => * Not    good eno   ugh. You're the person who         * flo   ated this    amnesia story.                    * * Eve   r feel so   rry for him? For what he'd bee   n through   ?
NICKY => You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
PAMELA => You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
NICKY =>  You mean, did I want a date?
PAMELA => Did you?
NICKY => These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
PAMELA => Some women like Dobermans --
NICKY => What do you want from me?       I was reassigned. I'm out.                                 *
PAMELA => See   , that's a problem for me, Nicky.              * Wha   tever he's doing, we need to end it.           * Thi   s isn't the kind of mess you walk away         * fro   m.                                             *

KURT => Coming in now...
PAMELA =>  Is it him?
CRONIN => He's not hiding, that's for sure.
ZORN => Why Naples?     Why now?
KURT => Could be random.
CRONIN => Maybe he's running.
ABBOTT => On his own passport?
KIM =>  What's he actually doing?
CRONIN => What's he doing? He's making his first mistake...
NICKY => It's not a m   istake.  They don't m   ake mistakes. And they don't do random.     There's always an objective,           * always a tar   get.                                   * * If he's in N   aples, on his own passport,            * there's a re   ason.                                  *

JARDA => Shot dead in Paris.       Dead the night you walked out.
BOURNE/PHONE => Then who runs Treadstone?
JARDA => Nobody. They shut it down. We're the last two. It's over... 
BOURNE => You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?

BOURNE => Who sent you to Greece?
JARDA => A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
BOURNE => Pamela Landy?

IRENA => What?
BOURNE => I would grow up thinking that they didn't love me if they just left me like that.
BOURNE => It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
IRENA =>  Yes...
BOURNE => That's not what happened to your parents.
IRENA => Then what?
BOURNE => I killed them.
BOURNE                         * => It was my jo   b. My first time. Your father was s   upposed to be alone. But then your mother,    she came out of nowhere...  I had to cha   nge my plan.  You understa   nd me?  You don't ha   ve to live like that anymore. Thinking tha   t.
