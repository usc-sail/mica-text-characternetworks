VOICE => Professor Pentcho?
VOICE => Multi-tasking again?
ARLETTE => We can start the descent now.
GUIDE => Two hundred feet below us is the world's largest particle accelerator...
GUIDE => 27 kilometers in circumference, the beam pipe actually runs beneath the borders of Switzerland and France...
PENTCHO => Did you get that data off to Braverman at Cal Tech?
ARLETTE => Done.
GUIDE => ...at the moment of impact the electrons inside the pipe are travelling six hundred sixty six million miles per --
ARLETTE => We need to progress.
JACQUE => Hey, it is 3-P-O!  P, P, P!  Professore Paulo Pentcho!
PENTCHO => That's not an official nickname, Jacque.
JACQUE => Beh!  Eets just tun-nel humor.
PENTCHO => Did they recalibrate the 3k turn?
PENTCHO => Give me more angle-control on the bounce.
JACQUE => Benissimo, Professore.
PENTCHO => Fifteen seconds Arlette...
PENTCHO => Ten, nine, eight...
PENTCHO => Four, three, two...
WOMAN => Then goodbye...
FEMALE VOICE => WHAT DO YOU WANT?
FEMALE VOICE => WHAT DO YOU WANT, PAUL?
JACQUE => Impact!
VOICE => What the hell were you thinking?  What?  I want to know!  WHAT?!!
PENTCHO => Probability of this happening, same make, model, color and year is less likely than the proof for the existence of God.
WILL =>  Sorry I asked.  You got insurance?
WILL => Up the ramp.  Yeah... I'll -- There you are!  See me?  See?  They won't let you in?  Just walk... Here I am.
SINGER => I know this world is kil...ling you...
SINGER => My aim is true-ooooh.
WILL => I'll be there, Trent.  Yes.  20 minutes --
WILL => Son-of-a-bitch.  As if it was my fault I got rear-ended by...
WILL => ...some schmuck dreaming about God.  Mia?
WOMAN => Paul...?
WILL => Mia...
MIA => Then goodbye...
PENTCHO => Less likely than the existence of God.
PENTCHO => I've been dreaming about you.
MIA => Day or night?
PENTCHO => Both.
WILL => Mi.
PENTCHO => Is that your...
MIA => No.  Not yet.
PENTCHO => Could we go somewhere?
MIA => I'm heading out of town.
PENTCHO =>  Okay.
MIA => What?
PENTCHO => I could go out of town.
MIA => Could you?
PENTCHO =>  Where to?
MIA => A place you've never been.
PENTCHO => That's the physicist's playground.
MIA => Why am I doing this?
PENTCHO => It's an experiment.
MIA => We flopped the first time out.
PENTCHO => At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
MIA => And you think this is relevant to our relationship?
PENTCHO => Could be.
MIA =>  What universe are you in, Paul?
PENTCHO => A quantum one.
PENTCHO => The shorthand is, when you send electrons through space, it's impossible to say precisely what they are: particles or waves.
PENTCHO => They come into being as one or the other at the moment we observe them.
PENTCHO => Nothing is real until it's perceived.
MIA => The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
PENTCHO => How?
MIA => Baby, reality is what you choose to make it.
PENTCHO => God.
MIA => But only if you live your life that way.  If you experience every moment as discovery.
PENTCHO => Mia!  You're restoring heaven with dabs of paint.  You're bringing new order to the universe.
MIA => I always said we were in the same business...
PENTCHO => If you're right, we have a chance.  To be together.
VOICE => I'm not done.
PENTCHO => When I was a kid I used to snap my head back like a gunfighter on the draw, hoping to catch a glimpse behind me.
MIA => Of what?
PENTCHO => God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
PENTCHO => The universe is snapping my head back.  I'm losing my focus.
MIA => Welcome, Paul.  Welcome.
MIA => "Things fall apart; the center will not hold.  Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."
PENTCHO => An electron spoke to me yesterday.   I swear.
MIA => What did it want?
PENTCHO => That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
MIA => Like now?
PENTCHO => Yes.
PENTCHO => Did you know electrons have lovers?
MIA => No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
PENTCHO => Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
PENTCHO => A strip of silicon, which for you and me would be like...
MIA => She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
PENTCHO =>  A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
MIA => Dysfunctional --
PENTCHO => That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
MIA => And glow happily ever after.
MIA => Don't science me Paul.   What do you want?
VOICE => Paul?  Pauly?
EMPLOYEE => Rented every last ve-hicle.  'Cept one.
PENTCHO => I'll take it.
ALEXANDER => Paul... Pauly...
PENTCHO => I... I thought you were dead.
ALEXANDER => I must be.
ALEXANDER => Look at me.
ALEXANDER =>  "Alexander the Great."
ALEXANDER => 22 I built the first machine to transfer digital bits over a land line.  I wrote the TCP/IP protocol before thirty.  This mind , the one and only, was OBGYN at the birth of the Internet.  And where has it taken me?
ALEXANDER => To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
PENTCHO => You taking any medication?
ALEXANDER => Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me to this particular switching station?
PENTCHO => Dad...
ALEXANDER => Two: what if I didn't miss?
PENTCHO => You did.
ALEXANDER => Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
PENTCHO => You did miss --
ALEXANDER => -- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
ALEXANDER => What was her name?
PENTCHO => Excuse me???
ALEXANDER => What was her name?  The one I met.
PENTCHO => Mia...?
ALEXANDER => Yes....
ALEXANDER => The restorer...
PENTCHO => I need some air.  Don't shoot me.
ALEXANDER => Good night.
ALEXANDER => We've been kidding ourselves, Pauly.  Until you look for it, it doesn't even exist.
OLD WOMAN => You would have a son with me...
PENTCHO => "If you could look back fast enough, at near to the speed of light, then there would be no reality behind you, because it hadn't yet been created --
VOICE => Uncle, hey...
MAGIC MAN => Can you feel it, uncle?  Can you feel it right down to your bones?!
PENTCHO => Yes.   Yes I can.
WOMAN => What do you want?!
WOMAN => Tell me!  Now!  Now!
ALEXANDER => Guess who's coming to dinner.
MIA => I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
PENTCHO => Wait.  I want to tell you something.
MIA => I've been dreaming about this.
PENTCHO =>  Then you get it.  You'll understand.
MIA => What?
PENTCHO => I know what I want.  I let go, and a second later you materialized at the door.  You see?
PENTCHO => Mia.  I can create reality.   I can choose to love you with all my heart.
MIA => You know those people who won't be photographed because they're afraid you're stealing their souls...?  I came to take back my picture.  The one I keep leaving with you.
PENTCHO => Why?
MIA => So I can move on.  You too.
MIA => Be who you are, Paul.  I love who you are. I do.
MIA => I'll drive.
ALEXANDER => Do you want to think about it some more?
WILL => You okay?
PENTCHO => What do you want?
VOICE => Impact!
