MRS. ALVARADO => So what?
ALIKE => What do you think?
MRS. ALVARADO => They're okay.
ALIKE => Okay?
MRS. ALVARADO => They're lovely. Of course your descriptiveness and use of alliteration is beautiful and all, you know that. But...I don't know. Is it your best? No.
ALIKE => I thought it was good.
MRS. ALVARADO => It's good. Not great.
MRS. ALVARADO => I believe you can go deeper.

MRS. SINGLETARY => Whatchu got there? You been shopping?

AUDREY => Oh I'm...I don't know where my mind is...Yeah, this is just uh--well let me get your opinion.
MRS. SINGLETARY => Oh that's nice.
AUDREY => Yeah see isn't this cute?
MRS. SINGLETARY => Umm-hmm. That's for your daughter?
AUDREY => Yeah, this is for Alike.
MRS. SINGLETARY => The youngest one.
AUDREY => No she's the oldest one.
MRS. SINGLETARY => Oh, the other one. Okay.
AUDREY => What, you think it's too young?
MRS. SINGLETARY => No, no. For whatever reason the youngest one popped in my mind first. But I think it should be fine. It's really cute.
AUDREY => Thank you.
MRS. SINGLETARY => It'll compliment her figure.
AUDREY => Now see that's what I thought... But Lee doesn't like anything I pick out for her anymore.
MRS. SINGLETARY => Girl, please. My oldest, 17 going on 27 mind you, banned me from buying her any more clothes. We have two completely different tastes. I just give her gift cards now and trust me, we're both happier for it. Is it her birthday?
AUDREY => No, no. I just wanted to get her something nice. You know.
AUDREY => Well, no we--
MRS. SINGLETARY => None of yo' damn business!!
MRS. SINGLETARY => Let me know how it goes.

SHARONDA => I don't know. Maybe Derek. If he asks me. Maybe Parrish. I haven't decided yet. But for homecoming, I definitely want to go with Craig.
AUDREY => Oooh, I see. Lee, who are you going with?
ALIKE => Umm. I'm not going.
AUDREY => Not going? This is your junior year. How can you not go?
ARTHUR => Leave her alone Audrey, if doesn't want to go, she doesn't have to go.
AUDREY => But it's her junior year, she's not gonna have any memories.
ARTHUR => I don't like all those boys buzzing around my daughters anyway.
SHARONDA => Nobody buzzes around Alike.
ARTHUR => That's right and it better stay that way. Matter of fact, I don't know if I'ma let you go.
SHARONDA => Daaa-aad?!

ALIKE => You listening?
LAURA => I'm listening--all I'm saying is-- pass me that milkshake mix right there.
LAURA => All I'm saying is that I don't think you should put yourself out there like that. Especially if you don't even know if she likes you like that.
ALIKE => She does.
LAURA => How do you know she does?
ALIKE => I just know she does.
LAURA => Hmmph. We'll see.
ALIKE => What're you doing?
LAURA => I thought I felt a drop of pig shit.
ALIKE => Shut up.
LAURA => All I know is I been trying to get you to holla at girls in the club for the longest.
ALIKE => I don't want to holla at girls in the club.
LAURA => Obviously. Why you pressed about this chick?
ALIKE => I wanted to ask you about something else too.
LAURA => Oh God, what now?
ALIKE => I need you to get something for me.
LAURA => What?!
LAURA => What?!
ALIKE => Just for my image.

LAURA => I'm serious, I mean it doesn't look that bad.
ALIKE => I can't believe you.
LAURA => What?!
ALIKE => Laura, this doesn't look right. I'ma look stupid.
LAURA => Well, first of all-- I don't think its supposed to be on top of your underwear like that.
ALIKE => I'm not putting this thing next to my skin, it pinches already.
LAURA => It's supposed to fit like that.
ALIKE => They didn't have any brown?
LAURA => I didn't have time for all of that. The brown ones were too big, anyway.
ALIKE => Ugh! You gotta take it back.
LAURA => I can't take it back.
ALIKE => Here's the receipt!
LAURA => Unh-unh. I'm not going back in there. One time was embarrassing enough.
ALIKE => You grown!

ALIKE => In the bathroom.
LAURA => Then where you gon' put it? You gonna walk around the club with a dick in your hand? Chill. I knew we shouldn't have done this. You blowin' me right now.
ALIKE => Then I'm out.
LAURA => Nah, you're `bout to stay and go through this. You're the one who wanted to meet her, not me.
ALIKE => Then you come on, too. Hurry up--
MIKA => You alright?
ALIKE => Yeah, no, yeah it's just--there's a spring in the cushion or something.
MIKA => You wanna switch seats?
ALIKE => No, I'm good.

LAURA => Hey ya'll we're about to go dance!
ALIKE => No, no not really. I'm not really feeling the music.
MIKA => Well you don't mind right? I mean you don't mind if I go dance with somebody else?
ALIKE => No, do your thing.
MIKA => If you change your mind--

AUDREY => Hey there, you're home early--well actually late. I thought you would have called--
ALIKE => Dad--
ARTHUR => Do what your mom says.
AUDREY => Are you hungry? Let me heat it up for you.
AUDREY => I'll heat it up on the stove for you. Tastes better.
ALIKE => Dad--
AUDREY => Lee!
ARTHUR => Leave me out of it.
AUDREY => Go get changed.
ALIKE => Dad, what's wrong with this outfit?
ARTHUR => Nothing.
ALIKE => See?
AUDREY => I'm not gonna argue with you.
ARTHUR => Do what she says.
ALIKE => Dad--
ARTHUR =>  Umgowa!
AUDREY => And put on a skirt!

AUDREY => Did you talk to her?
ARTHUR => Get me a beer, please. Sharonda's fine.
AUDREY => I'm talking about Lee.
ARTHUR => Alike. And I don't see that there's a problem.
AUDREY => I'm tired of this tomboy thing she's got going on. And Laura. You said you were going to handle it.
ARTHUR => Umm-hmm.
AUDREY => She needs a male point of view.
ARTHUR => I said okay, dammit! Now can I please have a beer please?
AUDREY => It's Sunday morning.
ARTHUR => It goes with the spaghetti.
AUDREY => Do you have to work tonight?
ARTHUR => To put food on the table and clothes on our backs, no. To go out to restaurants and keep designer sneakers in the closet, yes.
AUDREY => Are you forever gonna be mad?
ARTHUR => Are you forever going to be happy?  You made that decision a long time ago.
AUDREY => We both made sacrifices.
ARTHUR => You look beautiful, baby.
AUDREY => Tuck your blouse in.
ALIKE => This isn't me.
AUDREY => Tuck your blouse in.
ARTHUR => Leave it out.
ARTHUR => I think it's fine out. What's the deal with you and Laura?
ALIKE => What deal?
AUDREY => Comin' in late...

ARTHUR => Why don't you give that a break for a little while?
ALIKE => Dad, come on...
AUDREY =>  You heard him! 
SHARONDA => Coming!
AUDREY => You coming with us?
ARTHUR => Nope. Sleep.
AUDREY => We could go to a later service. The one o'clock--
ARTHUR => I said NO!!
SHARONDA => I'm ready.
ARTHUR => Alike, you look beautiful. Everybody looks beautiful, okay?
AUDREY => Lee! Lee! Here's someone I want you to meet.
ALIKE => Huh?
ALIKE => Oh. Hey.
AUDREY => Get down out the car and come speak.
AUDREY => What's wrong with you?
ALIKE => Alright, Mom.
AUDREY => You'll have to excuse her, she's been feeling rude lately.
MRS. SINGLETARY => Oh don't worry, Audrey, I understand how it is. Hormones. It's just a phase.
AUDREY => Alike, this is Mrs. Singletary, one of my co-workers and her daughter, Bina. Sylvia, Bina, this is my daughter Alike, we call her "Lee" for short.
ALIKE => Hi.
MRS. SINGLETARY => Hello.
ALIKE => Nice to meet you.
BINA => Hi.
AUDREY => And this is my youngest daughter, Sharonda.
SHARONDA => Hi.
BINA => Hi.
MRS. SINGLETARY => Hi there, nice to meet you.
AUDREY => Lee, Bina goes to the same school as you.
ALIKE => Cool.
BINA => Yeah, I think I've seen you around. Mrs. Alvarado's class right? AP English?
ALIKE => Yup.
AUDREY => So. Now that we're all acquainted, don't be a stranger.
MRS. SINGLETARY => Oh no, we won't.
AUDREY => Bina I think you and Lee may even go to school the same way. Don't you live off of St. James Place?
MRS. SINGLETARY => There is something to be said for safety in numbers.
MRS. SINGLETARY => Well, we need to be pushing off -- I'll call you about those VBS workbooks.
AUDREY => Alrighty, I'll be around. Take care.
ALIKE => You're funny.
AUDREY => I don't know what your problem is.
SHARONDA => Can somebody put in this CD please?
ALIKE => I don't know what you think is going to change.
AUDREY => I know God doesn't make mistakes. I know that much.
AUDREY => You may not like Bina, but you're certainly gonna be spending much less time with that Laura person, I guarantee you that much.
SHARONDA => Moooom, can you--
AUDREY => Be quiet. Nobody's putting in anything. I'm gonna listen to what I want to listen to for a change.
BINA => Look, I don't like lying to my mother, that's all.
ALIKE => Then don't, she doesn't have to know.
BINA => She does.    She asks me everyday.
ALIKE => So tell her yeah.
BINA => No, I'm sick of lying to cover for you.
ALIKE => So don't.
BINA => Look Alike, Lee. Whatever it is you wanna be called. I'm not trying to hang out with you, either, but I'm not about to take an L for it. So stop dodging me, let's just go to school together and be done with it. We don't have to see each other any other time than that.
BINA => Whatever, my mother asks me again, I'm telling her. Then she can tell your mother, then it's whatever for you.
ALIKE => Hey!
ALIKE => Hey!
ALIKE => Hey look, I'm sorry.
BINA => Yeah, you sorry your mom is gonna bug out.
ALIKE => No for real, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be that way. It's just... OK, I am concerned that my, my mom will find out, but...
BINA => But?
ALIKE => It's not like that. It's just-- she's just. If you knew her, you'd understand. She's like, I don't know.
ALIKE => So what's your favorite class?
BINA => You don't have to make small talk. Let's just walk.
ALIKE => I said I'm sorry. It's not you, it's just that my mom is like, she's like...
BINA => Overprotective?
ALIKE => Yeah.
BINA => I can tell. I've seen--I mean, a lot of people's parents are like that.
ALIKE => Yeah?
BINA => Yeah.
ALIKE => Yeah. But probably not like mine. But anyway...
BINA => Anyway, like I said, we don't have to talk. Just walk.

ALIKE => Definitely.
ALIKE => A butterfly, briefly Suffocated On the mucous of its own change Imprisoned 
underdeveloped => Wings And Cramped In the darkness of the too-tight cocoon of its own creation Pauses Thinking death inevitable Prepares to die in the absolute solitude Of Swollen Husk. A c r a c k appears A thin jagged light connecting The inner to the outer world A butterfly, briefly Paralyzed by the imminence of death Discovers life is possible.
MRS. ALVARADO => Comments? Critiques? Julie, tell me what you think.
ALIKE => I liked your story, though. It was tight.
BINA => Yeah? Which one? The one about the--
ALIKE => The one about karma, how things come back to you. That one, I thought it was tight.
BINA => For real? Thanks. I wasn't gonna say anything, but I liked yours too.
ALIKE => Why?
BINA => Why did I like it or why wasn't I gonna say anything?
ALIKE => Why did you like it?
BINA => I don't know. I guess because it felt honest.
ALIKE => Oh.
BINA => Didn't you have on a different shirt earlier?
ALIKE => What?
BINA => Nothin'.
ALIKE => No, what'd you say?
BINA => Nothin'.

BINA => Oh... Well, that's cool.
ALIKE => So why weren't you gonna say anything about it?
BINA => About your shirt?
ALIKE => About the poem.
BINA => Cause you're moody.
ALIKE => Moody?
BINA => And quiet.
ALIKE => Man, I'm not moody.
BINA => Yeah, right.

BINA => Anyway, this is the other artist I was telling you about. Her stuff is like, bouncier.
ALIKE => This is straight. You'll burn me a copy?
BINA => Yeah, I have a bunch of other stuff, too.  So who do you hang out with? I don't really see you with anybody.
BINA => I didn't mean it like that. I was just asking because I was curious. I don't really like anybody that goes there either.
ALIKE => My friend Laura used to go there. Not now, but she's going back.
BINA => Oh because, I was just gonna say-- I'm going to this house party and you can come if you want to.

ARTHUR => Uh-huh.
ALIKE => I mean, they haven't said anything yet. But what if... so what if the person is kinda like a friend, but you know they like you more than that?
ARTHUR => Well, I think that's the best way to start--as friends.
ALIKE => But then what if...What if the person is --
ARTHUR => What's his name? What grade is he in? 
ALIKE => Yeah.
ARTHUR => Say uh--there's this new--uh women's club up there by the liquor store--have you--do you--you haven't heard anything about it, right?

AUDREY => You and your daughter. Have you talked to Lee yet? I told you she--
ARTHUR => I talked to Alike.
AUDREY => You did?
ARTHUR => Everything's fine. Like I told you. Matter fact, she's got a boyfriend.
AUDREY => Boyfriend?
ARTHUR => Just give her some space.
AUDREY => Space? She's hardly ever home in the first place and you're just like her, creeping in all hours of the night. Both of you. Running around like you got something to hide, like I'm the big, bad witch and what about me? I'm home by myself all the time and Sharonda's getting older and starting to go out and pretty soon--
ARTHUR => I don't have anything to hide. Look I told you I talked to Alike and everything is fine.
AUDREY => Did you ask her?
ARTHUR => No, because I didn't have to. Besides,I would know okay? If anybody would know, it would be me. I know my daughter--
AUDREY => Your daughter?!!
ARTHUR => --better than anyone else and--
AUDREY => So now all of a sudden she's just your daughter?!
ARTHUR                          AUDREY => --I'm telling you she's just    Well I guess I better not fine!!                          have nothing else to say then, huh?!

ARTHUR => Will you shut the fuck up?!
AUDREY => An hour? Really? I'm not your dumb damn floozy in the street. And you will not talk to me that way.
ALIKE => I know you're not scared.

LAURA => Look, I'm sorry for all the drama.
ALIKE => No, it's cool. I shoulda--

ALIKE => C'mon man, you know you're my best friend. Nobody's gonna --

SHARONDA => Dad. You know where she is.
ALIKE => Where's Mom?
ARTHUR => She...your mother couldn't make it.
ARTHUR => Remember our old place? Waaay out in Queens? It was our first apartment, we were so proud. Had all those trees around it? In October, the whooole block would be covered with leaves. You remember.
ARTHUR => You couldnt've been more than 2 years old. And when the wind would blow, all those leaves would come rushing down the street at us and you thought they were alive. You'd get so scared. You'd cry and you'd scream and beg for us to pick you up. I would try and tell you "they're only leaves, baby" and make you stay on the ground. But you were so afraid and you cried so hard, your mother would always pick you up. She always picked you up.
ARTHUR => `Member how we used to--
ALIKE => I've been accepted into a early college program. Starts in the Spring. Berkeley.

ALIKE => I need to know now if you'll sign the papers. Yes or no?
ARTHUR => Can you forgive me?
ALIKE => Yes or no?
ARTHUR => You can always come back home. Things are gonna be different, I promise you--
ALIKE => Dad, I'm not running. I'm choosing.
ALIKE => I'm not going back home.
ARTHUR => I know.  Okay.
ARTHUR => I better--
ALIKE => Tell Mom that she was right.
ARTHUR => Right about what?
ALIKE => God doesn't make mistakes.
ARTHUR => You should tell her yourself.
ALIKE => Mom.
AUDREY => Lee--Alike. How've you been?
ALIKE => Fine. Did Dad tell you?
AUDREY => He told me, yes.
ALIKE => How are you?
AUDREY => I just hope you're keeping yourself safe.
ALIKE => I love you, Mom.
ALIKE => I said I love you.
AUDREY => I'll be praying for you.
ALIKE => Heartbreak opens onto the sunrise For even breaking is opening And I am broken I am open Broken to the new light without pushing in Open to the possibilities within pushing out See the love shine in through my cracks See the light shine out through me? I am broken I am open I am Broken Open See the love-light shining through me Shining through my cracks Through the gaps My Spirit takes journey My Spirit takes flight Could not have risen otherwise And I am not Running I am Choosing Running is not a Choice From the Breaking Breaking is freeing Broken is freedom I am not broken I am free.
