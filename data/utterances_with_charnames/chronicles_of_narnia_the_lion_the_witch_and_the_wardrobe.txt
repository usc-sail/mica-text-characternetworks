MRS. PEVENSIE => Edmund Get Away from there! What do you think you're doing?! Peter!
PETER => Come on! To the shelter, now!
SUSAN =>  Lucy, come on! Lucy!
EDMUND => Wait, dad!
PETER => Come on idiot (Throws Edmund onto the ground and starts shouting) Why do you always have to be so selfish! You only think about yourself. Why can't you ever do as you're told!
ANNOUNCER => Attention, would all parents ensure that their parents have the appropriate identification papers.
MRS. PEVENSIE => You warm enough? Now honey you have to keep this on you. Be sure and keep this on.
EDMUND => If Dad were here, the war would be over, and we wouldn't have to go
PETER => If dad wasn't fighting and the war was over we wouldn't have to go.
MRS. PEVENSIE => You will listen to your brother, won't you Edmund?
MRS. PEVENSIE => Look after the others
PETER => I will mum
MRS. PEVENSIE => You be a big girl now Susan,
MRS. PEVENSIE => There now... off you go.
PETER => Come on, we've got to stay together now. Everything's going to be okay
SUSAN => Peter!
EDMUND => I know how to get on a train
PETER => Bye Mom, we'll miss you
MRS. PEVENSIE => Good-Bye my darlings
SUSAN => The Professor knew we were coming?
EDMUND => Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled?
PETER => Mrs. Macready?
MRS. MACREADY => I'm afraid so. Is that it then? Haven't you brought anything else?
PETER => No, ma'am. It's just us.
MRS. MACREADY => Small favours.
MRS. MACREADY => The professor is unaccustomed to having children in his house, and as such, there are a few rules we need to follow. There will be no shouting' or running', no improper use of the dumbwaiter, NO touching of the historical artifacts and above all, there shall be no disturbing' of the Professor.
RADIO-MAN => German aircraft carried out several attacks on Great Britain last night
LUCY => The sheets feel scratchy
SUSAN => Wars don't last forever, Lucy. We'll be home soon.
EDMUND => If home's still there.
SUSAN => Isn't time you were in bed?
EDMUND => YES, Mom!
PETER => ED!
SUSAN => Gas-tro-vas-cu-lar.
PETER => Is it Latin?
SUSAN => Yes...
EDMUND => Is it Latin for worst game ever invented?
LUCY => We could play hide-and-seek
PETER => but we're already having so much fun!
LUCY => Please, please, please.
PETER => One...two...three...four...
EDMUND => Get out! I was here first!
PETER => Eight four, eighty five...
LUCY => 
TUMNUS =>  Uh, CH... gk, ch
LUCY => Were you hiding from me?
TUMNUS => Huh, um, n..n.. no, I..I... I didn't want to scare you,
LUCY => if you don't mind my asking...what are you?
TUMNUS => Why, I'm a faun! And you must be some beardless dwarf?
LUCY => I'm not a dwarf, I'm a girl! And actually I'm tallest in my class.
TUMNUS => But you're saying, you're a daughter of Eve?
LUCY => Well, my mum's name is Helen...
TUMNUS => Yes, but you are, in fact, human.
LUCY => Of course.
TUMNUS => What are you doing here?
LUCY => Well, I came in through the wardrobe in the spare room, and-
TUMNUS => Spare Oom, is that in Narnia?
LUCY => Narnia? What's that?
TUMNUS => My dear girl, you're in it!  Everything from the lamp post, all the way to castle Cair Paravel on the Eastern Sea, every stick and stone, every icicle, is Narnia,
LUCY => This is an awfully big wardrobe
TUMNUS => I'm sorry, please allow me to introduce myself, my name is Tumnus
LUCY => Glad to meet you, Mr. Tumnus! *extends hand* I'm Lucy Pevensie. Oh, you shake it!
TUMNUS => Why?
LUCY => I-I don't know! People do it when they meet each other.
TUMNUS => Lucy Pevensie, from the shining city of War Drobe in the far land of Spare Oom, how would it be if you came and had tea with me?
LUCY => Oh! Well, thank you very much! But I probably should be getting back...
TUMNUS => Oh, come on! It's not every day I get to make a new friend! And there's a... roaring fire! And toast and cakes! And maybe... we'll even break into the sardines.
LUCY => Well, maybe for just a little while... if you have... sardines.
TUMNUS => By the bucket load,
TUMNUS => Come Along.
LUCY => Can I help you with that?
TUMNUS => Why thank you!
TUMNUS => Oh... That is my father.
LUCY => He had a nice face. You look just like him.
TUMNUS => No, were not alike at all really.
LUCY => My father is fighting in the war.
TUMNUS => My father went away to war too... but that was a very long time ago... before this dreadful winter.
LUCY => Winter isn't all bad. There's ice skating and snow ball fights. Oh! And Christmas!
TUMNUS => We haven't had Christmas in a hundred years here.
LUCY => No presents for a hundred years?
TUMNUS => But, oh, you would have loved Narnia in spring! The Dryads and the Fauns would dance all night... but we never got tired. And oh, the music! Such music. Would you... like to hear some now?
LUCY => yes please
TUMNUS => Now, are you familiar with the Narnia lullabies?
LUCY => : No, I'm afraid I'm not
TUMNUS => Good, because this probably won't sound anything like one.
LUCY => Oh I must go
TUMNUS => It's too late for that now I'm such a bad faun
LUCY => No. You're the nicest faun I've ever met.
TUMNUS => Then I'm afraid you've had a very poor sampling.
LUCY => I'm sure you're very sorry, and you'll never do it again.
TUMNUS => It's not something I have done, Lucy Pevensie. It's something I'm doing.
LUCY => What are you doing?
TUMNUS => I'm kidnapping you. It's the White Witch, the one that makes it always winter, and never Christmas. She told me that I If I ever was to come across a son of Adam or a daughter of Eve, I am supposed to turn it over to her!
LUCY => But I thought you were my friend
TUMNUS => We must move quietly the woods are full of her spies, even some of the trees are on her side
LUCY => I think so. (Tumnus starts to return her handkerchief, but she gives it back) Keep it, you need it more than I do.
MR. TUMNUS => Go...   Come on, go!
PETER => 98, 99, 100... Ready or not here I come.
LUCY => I'm back, I'm back, it's alright,
EDMUND => Shhh, he's coming.
PETER => You know, I'm not sure if you two have quite gotten the idea of this game!
LUCY => but weren't you wondering where I was?
EDMUND => That's the point! That's why he was seeking you!
SUSAN => Does this mean I win?
PETER => I don't think Lucy wants to play anymore.
SUSAN => The only wood in here is the back of the wardrobe.
PETER => One game at a time Lu, we don't all have your imagination.
LUCY => But I wasn't imagining!
SUSAN => that's enough
EDMUND => Well I believe you.
LUCY => You do?
EDMUND => Yah, didn't I tell you about the football field I found in the bathroom closet?
PETER => Why don't you just stop it, you always have to make everything worse. Grow up!
EDMUND => Shut up! You think you're dad, but you're not!
SUSAN => well, that was nicely handled! (walks away too..)
LUCY => It was really there...
PETER => Susan's right. That's enough..
EDMUND => Lucy, Lucy. I hope you're not afraid of the dark
EDMUND => Lucy? Lucy! I think I believe you now!
EDMUND => Lucy?
DWARF => Yah!
WHITE WITCH => What is it Ginarrbrik?
EDMUND => He won't let go!
DWARF => Is that how you address the Queen of Narnia?
EDMUND => I didn't know?
DWARF => Well, you shall know her better afterwards.
WHITE WITCH => Wait! What is your name Son-of-Adam?
EDMUND => Edmund, your majesty.
WHITE WITCH => And how was it, Edmund, that you came to enter my dominion?
EDMUND => I walked through a wardrobe following my sister.
WHITE WITCH => Your sister? How many are you?
EDMUND => four
WHITE WITCH => Edmund you look so cold! Come and sit with me here on my sledge. (Edmund joins her) Now, would like something warm to drink.
EDMUND => Yes...your majesty.(Take vial and drops a green drop on snow that become a hot drink that the dwarf gives Edmund) How did you do that?
WHITE WITCH => I can make anything you like.
EDMUND => Could you make me taller?
WHITE WITCH => I can make anything you like to eat
EDMUND => Turkish Delight
WHITE WITCH => I'd love to see your family
EDMUND => They're nothing special
WHITE WITCH => I have no children of my own and you are such a good little boy (I never could hear those words right) where I could see, one day, you becoming prince of Narnia - maybe even king.
EDMUND => Really?
WHITE WITCH => Of course you'd have to bring your family.
EDMUND => They're nothing special
EDMUND => Oh, Peter will be king too?
WHITE WITCH => No! But a king needs servants.
EDMUND => I-I guess I could bring 'em.
WHITE WITCH => Beyond these woods, do you see those two little hills? My house is right between them. You'd love it there Edmund, it has whole rooms simply stuffed with Turkish Delight!
EDMUND => Couldn't I have some more now?
WHITE WITCH => NO!  Don't want to ruin you appetite.
WHITE WITCH => I'm going to miss you Edmund. But we are going to see each other soon.
EDMUND => I hope so.
WHITE WITCH => Until then...dear one. (WW drives of and Ed is left alone)
LUCY => Edmund? Oh Edmund!!!! I saw Mr. Tumnus again and he's fine!!! The White Witch hasn't found out about him helping me!
EDMUND => The White Witch?
LUCY => She calls herself the Queen of Narnia, but she really isn't. Edmund? Are you okay? You look awful.
EDMUND => Well what do you expect! It's freezing! How do we get out of here?
LUCY => Come on...this way.
LUCY =>  Peter, Peter wake up! It's there, it's really there!
PETER => Lucy, what are talking about?
LUCY => Narnia! It's all in the wardrobe, like I told you!
SUSAN => Oh Lucy, you've been dreaming.
LUCY => No I wasn't, I saw Mr. Tumnus again! Oh, and this time - Edmund went too.
PETER => You saw the faun?
LUCY => Well, he didn't actually go there with me. What were you doing Edmund?
EDMUND => I-I was just playing along. You know what little children are like these days, they just don't know when to stop pretending (sits on his bed looking smugly at Lucy)
EDMUND => Ow!
MRS. MACREADY => You children are one shenanigan shy of sleeping' in the stable- oh, Professor! I told them you were not to be disturbed.
PROFESSOR => Oh, it's alright Mrs. Macready - I'm sure there's a logical explanation. But I think this one needs some hot chocolate.
MRS. MACREADY => Yes Professor. Come on, dear.
PROFESSOR => *Ahem* (the two turn and follow him into his office and the Professor sits at his desk and takes some tobacco out of it's silver apple case and puts it in his pipe)
PROFESSOR => You seem to have upset the internal balance of my housekeeper.
PETER => We are very sorry sir, it won't happen again.
SUSAN => It's our sister sir, Lucy.
PROF => The weeping girl?
SUSAN => Yes sir, she's upset.
PROFESSOR => Hence the weeping
PETER => We can handle it!
PROFESSOR => Oh, I can see that.
SUSAN => She thinks she's found a magical land in the upstairs wardrobe.
PROFESSOR => What did you say!?
PETER => The wardrobe upstairs, Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside.
PROFESSOR => What was it like?
SUSAN => Like talking to a lunatic!
PROFESSOR => No, not her - the forest!
PETER => You're-you're not saying you believe her?
PROFESSOR => No, not her - the forest!
PETER => You....you actually believe her?
PROFESSOR => Well don't you?
SUSAN => Well, logically it couldn't possibly be there!
PROFESSOR => What do they teach at these schools?
PETER => Edmund said they were only pretending
PROFESSOR => And he's the more truthful one is he?
PETER => No, this would be the first time.
PROFESSOR => Well then, id your sister isn't lying and isn't mad then logically we must assume that she is telling the truth. She's your sister, isn't she? You're a family! It's high time you start acting like one!
PETER => Peter winds up, goes for the bowl!
EDMUND => Ow!
PETER => Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream!
EDMUND => Can't we play hide and go seek again?
PETER => I thought you said that it was a kid's game.
SUSAN => Besides, we can all use the fresh air.
EDMUND => Not like there's air inside
PETER => Are you ready then?
EDMUND => Are you? (smacks his bat on the ground and gets ready to hit the ball)
PETER => Well done, Ed!
EDMUND => You bowled it!
SUSAN => Listen, Mrs. Macready is coming
PETER => Run!
EDMUND =>  Come on!
SUSAN => You have got to be joking.
PETER => Go!
SUSAN => Get back!
SUSAN => Impossible!
LUCY => Don't worry, it's probably just your imagination
PETER => I don't suppose saying we're sorry would quite cover it?
LUCY => No, it wouldn't. But this might!
EDMUND => Ow!  Stop it! (They all realize that Ed lied)
PETER => You little liar!
EDMUND => You didn't believe her either!
PETER => Apologize to Lucy. (He just looks at her)
PETER => Say you're sorry! (Peter steps up to him)
EDMUND => Alright! I'm sorry.
LUCY => That's alright, some little children just don't know when to stop pretending. 
EDMUND => : Very funny.
SUSAN => Maybe we should go back
EDMUND => Can't we at lease take a look around?
PETER => I think Lucy must decide!
LUCY => I all want you to meet Mr. Tumnus!
PETER => Well Mr. Tumnus it is (walks into the wardrobe again)
SUSAN => We can't just walk around in these clothes!
PETER => We can use these coats.
SUSAN => Peter, they don't belong to us.
PETER => Well I don't think the professor will mind. And if you think about it logically we are not even taking them out of the wardrobe.
EDMUND => But that's a girl's coat!
PETER => I know.
PETER => LUCY!
LUCY => Who would do something like this?
SUSAN => Peter what is that on the wall?
PETER READS => The Former occupant of these premises, the Faun Tumnus, is under arrest and awaiting his trial on a charge of High Treason against her imperial Majesty Jadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of Cair Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands, also to comforting her said Majesty's enemies, harbouring spies and fraternizing with Humans. signed Maugrim, captain of the Secret Police, Long live the Queen.
SUSAN => Now we should really go.
LUCY => But we have to help him!
PETER => It's out of our hands now Lu.
LUCY => You don't get it do you? I'm the human!!! He helped ME!
PETER => Maybe we should call the police
SUSAN => These are the police!
EDMUND => Besides, he's a criminal!
PETER => Don't worry Lucy, we'll think of something
ROBIN => Psst!
SUSAN => Did that bird just 'psst' us?
LUCY => It's a beaver.
PETER => Here, boy *clicks* come here...*clicks*
MR.BEAVER => Well, I ain't gonna smell it if that's what you want!
EDMUND => It's a talking beaver!
MR.BEAVER => Lucy Pevensie?
LUCY => Yes?
LUCY => This is the handkerchief I gave to Mr-
MR. BEAVER => Tumnus. He gave it to me just before they took him.
LUCY => Is he alright?
MR. BEAVER => Further in.(Mr. Beaver scurries off, Susan grabs Peter by the arm)
SUSAN => Peter, we don't know what you are doing.
EDMUND => She's right. How do we know we can trust this beaver?
PETER => He say's he knows the faun.
SUSAN => He's a beaver...he shouldn't be saying anything!
MR. BEAVER => Is everything alright?
PETER => Yes. We were just talking
MR. BEAVER => That's better left for safer corners.
LUCY => He means the trees.
MR. BEAVER => There is home sweet home.
LUCY => Oh, what a beautiful dam Mr. Beaver.
MR. BEAVER => Merely a trifle.
MRS. BEAVER => Is that you Beaver? I find out you've been out with Badger again I'll...Oh, they're not Badgers. I never thought I would see this day
MR. BEAVER => I would have given you a week if I thought it would help
MRS. BEAVER => Well you must be cold and hungry. Let's get you inside for some food and civilized conversation.
MR. BEAVER => Enjoying the scenery, are we?
MRS. BEAVER => Fish and sticks, dear.
PETER => is there nothing we can do about Mr. Tumnus?
MRS. BEAVER => well.. there's hope!
MR. BEAVER => Yeah, there's a load full of hope... Aslan is on the move.
EDMUND => Who's Aslan?
MR. BEAVER => Aslan....you silly little blighter.....you don't know do you?
PETER => Well we haven't actually been here very long
MR. BEAVER => He's only the king the whole wood, the true king of Narnia.... and he's waiting for you!
LUCY => waiting for us?
BEAVER => You got to be joking! Look, Aslan's return, Tumnus' arrest.....the secret police! They're all happening because of you!
SUSAN => You're blaming us?
MRS. BEAVER => Not blaming you dear, thanking you.
BEAVER => There's....a prophecy, When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone sits in if Cair Paravel in throne the evil is over and done.
SUSAN => You know that doesn't really rhyme.
MR. BEAVER => I know, but you're missing the point!
MRS. BEAVER => It's long been told that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve will appear to defeat the White Witch, and restore peace to Narnia.
PETER => And you think we're the ones???
MR. BEAVER => Well you'd better be, Aslan's already fitted out your army!!!
PETER => I think you've made a mistake; we're not heroes!
SUSAN => We're from Finchley!
PETER => I think it's time we were going.
LUCY => But what about Mr. Tumnus?
PETER => Sorry Lucy. It's out of our hands.
SUSAN => Thank you for your hospitality.
PETER => Ed, time to go- Ed? (looks around the room) I'm going to kill him.
MR. BEAVER => You may not have to...Has Edmund been to Narnia before?
PETER => Hurry up!
LUCY => Edmund!
MR. BEAVER => Shh! They'll hear ya!
PETER => Get off me!
PETER => We just can't let him go!
BEAVER => Don't you get it?! He's the bait! She wants all of ya in there!!! To kill ya!
SUSAN => This is all your fault! None of this would have happened if you had just listened to me in the first place!
PETER => So you knew this would happen?
SUSAN => I didn't know what would happen...
LUCY => Stop, this fighting isn't going to help Edmund
BEAVER => She's right. Only Aslan can save him now.
PETER => Then take us to him.
MAUGRIM => Stand still stranger!
EDMUND => I'm a Son of Adam, I met the Queen in the woods!
MAUGRIM => My apologies, fortunate favourite of the queen - or perhaps not so fortunate.
MAUGRIM => Wait here (Edmund sees the glorious throne, and sits on it longingly. Then, the witch comes up behind him and says, scaring him half to death.)
WHITE WITCH => You like it!
EDMUND => Ye... yes, your majesty!
WHITE WITCH => I thought you might
WHITE WITCH => Tell me, you sisters, are they deaf?
EDMUND => No
WHITE WITCH => and your brother, unintelligent?
EDMUND => Well I think so, but mom says...
WHITE WITCH => Then how dare you come alone! Edmund, I ask so little of you
EDMUND => They just don't listen to me!
WHITE WITCH => Couldn't even do that!
EDMUND => I...I did bring them half way. There at the dam at the house of the beaver's!
WHITE WITCH => Well...I guess your not a total lost then.
EDMUND => Is there any chance I may have some more Turkish delight now?
WHITE WITCH => Ginnabrick, our guest is hungry
GINNABRICK => This way...for your num nums...
WHITE WITCH => Maugrim!!!! You know what to do....
MAUGRIM => Take them
MR.BEAVER => Hurry Mum, they are after us!
MRS. BEAVER => right then...
SUSAN => What is she doing?
MRS. BEAVER => Don't worry, you'll thank you me later. it's a long journey and a beaver gets cranky when he's hungry.
BEAVER => I'M CRANKY NOW!
SUSAN => Do you think we should bring jam?
PETER => Only if the Witch has toast.
MR. BEAVER => This should lead to Aslan's
MRS. BEAVER => I thought it lead to your mums!
LUCY => They're in the tunnel!
MRS. BEAVER => You should have brought a map!
BEAVER => There was no room next to the jam!
MR. BEAVER => He was my best mate!
SUSAN => What happened to them?
FOX => This is what happens to the enemies of the White Witch.
MR. BEAVER => Stand still there traitor.
FOX => Relax, I'm one of the good guys
MR. BEAVER => Well you look mighty like one of the bad guys.
FOX => An unfortunate family resemblance, but we can discuss family breeding later right now we need to move.
PETER => What do you suggest?
FOX => Evening gents, Did we lose something?
WOLF => Don't patronized me, I know where your allegiance lies. We are looking for some humans
FOX => Humans in Narnia, now that's some valuable information
MAUGRIM => Where are they?!!!
FOX => They , they , were heading North.
MAUGRIM => Quickly, smell them out.
LUCY => are you all right?
FOX => Well, I wish I could say their bark was worse than their bite.
MRS. BEAVER => Stop squirming! You're worse than beaver on bath day
MR. BEAVER => Worst day of the year
FOX => Well I am afraid that is all the healing I have time for.
SUSAN => You're leaving?
FOX => It has been a pleasure my Queen. I have been asked by Aslan HIMSELF to gather more troops.
MR. BEAVER => You've seen Aslan!
MRS. BEAVER => What is He like?
FOX => Like everything we have ever heard. He'll be a good help fighting the White Witch
SUSAN => We are not planning fighting any witch
FOX => Surely King Peter...
PETER => We just want to get our brother back.
MR. TUMNUS => Are you gonna eat that? (from the other prison)
EDMUND => Mr... Tumnus.
MR. TUMNUS => Your Lucy Pevensies brother.
EDMUND => I'm Edmund!
MR. TUMNUS => You have the same nose.
MR. TUMNUS => Is your sister alright? Is she safe?
EDMUND => I... I don't know!
WHITE WITCH => My wolves tore that dam apart, your little family was nowhere to be found. Where are they?!
EDMUND => I don't know..
WHITE WITCH => Then you are no longer any use to me...Guard
EDMUND => Wait they said something about Aslan
WHITE WITCH => Aslan! Where?
MR. TUMNUS => Stranger has only been in Narnia a short...(Hit in head)
EDMUND => I left before I could hear anymore...I wanted to see you again.
WHITE WITCH => Guard!
GUARD => Yes, your majesty
WHITE WITCH => Release the Faun (Guard hit chains and Tumnus cries out in pain as they drop him by the Witch) Do you know why you are here?
MR. TUMNUS => Because I believe in a free Narnia
WHITE WITCH => You're here because he turned you in...for sweeties. (turns to dwarf and guard) Take him upstairs and ready my sleigh, Edmund misses his family.
MR. BEAVER => Now Aslan's camp is just over there by the stone table just across the frozen river.
SUSAN => River?
MRS. BEAVER => It's been frozen for 100 years
PETER => It seems so far
MRS. BEAVER => It's the world dear, did you expect it to be small?
SUSAN => Smaller...
WHITE WITCH => Whenever you are ready Son-of-Adam.
MR. BEAVER => Come on, before we're old
PETER => If he tells me to Hurry up one more time I'm going to turn him into a big fluffy hat
MR. BEAVER => Hurry up Son-of-Adam! We don't have all day.
LUCY => He is getting kinda bossy
MR. BEAVER => It's her! Run!
LUCY => Maybe she's gone.
PETER => I'll go and have a look
MR. BEAVER => No, you're no good to Narnia dead.
MRS. BEAVER => Neither are you Beaver.
MR. BEAVER => Thanks dear.
MR. BEAVER => AHHH!....
LUCY => AHHH!
MR. BEAVER => I hope you've been good, because there is someone here to see you.
LUCY => Merry Christmas, Sir!
FATHER CHRISTMAS => It certainly is, Lucy. Thanks to you.
SUSAN => I thought there was no Christmas in Narnia.
FATHER CHRISTMAS => It hasn't been for a hundred years. But now the Witch's power is crumbling. (he goes to his bag and throws it to the ground)
LUCY => Presents!
FATHER CHRISTMAS => Lucy, Eve's Daughter. These are for you. The juice of the fire flower. If you, or one of your friends are wounded, one drop of this cordial will restore them. And though I do not expect you to use it, this.
LUCY => Well, I think I could be brave enough.
FATHER CHRISTMAS => I'm sure you could. But battles are ugly affairs. Eve's Daughter, Susan. Trust in this bow, for it does not easily miss.
SUSAN => What happened to, 'battles are ugly affairs?'
FATHER CHRISTMAS => And, though you don't seem to have trouble making yourself heard, this. When you put this horn to your lips and blow it, wherever you are, help will come.
SUSAN => Thanks.
FATHER CHRISTMAS => And, Peter. These are tools, not toys. The time to use them may be soon at hand.
FATHER CHRISTMAS => Bare them well! I best be off, winter is almost over and things do pile up when you've been gone a thousand years. Long live Aslan! (he gets in his sleigh and rides off)
THE CHILDREN => Bye... Merry Christmas!
LUCY => Told you he was real!
PETER => Did you hear what he said... winter is almost over. You no what that means... no more ice!
SUSAN => Wait, maybe we should think about this.
PETER => We don't have time.
SUSAN => I was just trying to be realistic
PETER => No, you're trying to be smart...as usual!
MR. BEAVER => Wait, maybe I should go first.
PETER => Maybe you should.
MRS. BEAVER => You've been sneaking second helpings haven't you?
MR BEAVER => Well you never know what meal is gonna be your last, especially with your cooking.
SUSAN => if mum knew what we were doing...
PETER => Mum's not here!!!
LUCY => Oh no!
PETER => Run!!!!!
MAUGRIM => Put that down boy, someone might get hurt.
MR. BEAVER => Don't worry about me! Slit his throat!
MAUGRIM => Leave now while you can, and you're brother leaves with you.
SUSAN => Stop Peter, maybe we should listen to him!
MAUGRIM => Smart girl.
MR. BEAVER => Don't listen to him. Kill him. Kill him now!
SUSAN => Look, just because some man in a red suit hands you a sword doesn't make you a hero! So just drop it!
BEAVER => No Peter! Narnia need ya!
MAUGRIM => What's it gonna be Son of Adam? We're not going to wait for ever. And neither is the river.
LUCY => PETER!!!!
PETER => Hold onto me!
SUSAN => What have you done?!
LUCY => Has anyone seen my coat?
MR. BEAVER => Your brother has you well looked after.
MRS. BEAVER => I don't think you'll be needing those coats any more!
DWARF => It's so warm here! I think I'll go check the sleigh.
WOLF => We found the traitor He was gathering troops near the sharwood forest.
WHITE WITCH => Nice of you to drop by. I understand you were so helpful to my wolves last night.
FOX => Forgive me your majesty
WHITE WITCH => Don't waste my time with flattery.
FOX => Not to seem rude, but I wasn't actually talking to you
WHITE WITCH =>  Where is ASLAN! Answer me! (About to hit him with wand)
EDMUND => Wait! The Beavers said something about the Stone Table and an army.
WHITE WITCH => Thank you Edmund. It is good for this creature to see some honesty before he dies..
EDMUND => NO!(Fox to stone and White Slaps Edmund across face)
WHITE WITCH => Think who's side you are on. MINE...(turns his head) Or theirs? If it is a war Aslan wants It's a war he shall get.
SUSAN => Why are they all staring at us?
LUCY => Maybe they think you look funny.
MR. BEAVER => Oh stop your fussing Mrs. Beaver. You look lovely.
PETER => We have come to see Aslan.
ASLAN => Welcome Peter Adam's son, Welcome Susan and Lucy daughters-of-Eve. Welcome Beavers. You have my thanks, but where is the fourth.
PETER => That's why we are here.
SUSAN => We had a little trouble along the way.
PETER => He's been captured by the White Witch
CROWD => Captured!
MR. BEAVER => He betrayed them your Excellence!
OREIUS => Then he has betrayed us all
ASLAN => Peace Oreius.
PETER => It is my fault really. I was too hard on him.
SUSAN => We all were.
LUCY => Sir, he's our brother.
ASLAN => I know dear and that makes the betrayal all the worse. It may be harder than you think
ASLAN => That is Cair Paravel of the four thrones one of which you must sit as High King.
ASLAN => You doubt the prophecy
PETER => No, that's just it...you're not who I think I am
ASLAN => Peter Pevensie formerly of Finnchley. Beaver also said you wanted to turn him into a hat.
PETER => I don't think I will be able.
ASLAN => You were able to get your family here.
PETER => Not all of them.
ASLAN => I will do what I can for Edmund. I too want my family safe.
SUSAN => Mother hasn't had a dress like this since before the war
LUCY => Maybe we had bring back a whole trunk load when we go home.
SUSAN => If we go home...Sorry I guess I am like that. Remember when we use to have fun?
LUCY => Yes, before you go boring.
SUSAN => Oh really (Splashes water and this continues as Susan goes to get towel and...)
WOLF => Now, We're very tired. We'd prefer to kill you quickly.
CUT TO => Peter and Aslan
CUT TO => Susan and Lucy
ASLAN => Follow him! He'll lead you to Edmund. Peter, clean your sword.
ASLAN => Rise, Sir Peter Wolfsbane--Knight of Narnia.
GENERAL OTMIN => The Minotaurs on the left, send in the dwarfs first.
DWARF => You're not going to kill him?
WHITE WITCH => Not yet! We have work to do (turning to Otmin)
LUCY => EDMUND!
ASLAN => What's done is done. There is no reason to bring up the past with your brother.
EDMUND => Hello...
LUCY => Oh, Edmund (Hugs him and Susan does too)
SUSAN => How are you feeling?
EDMUND => I'm feeling kinda tired
PETER => Get some rest...and Edmund try not to wander off again.
LUCY => Narnia isn't going to run out of toast Edmund
PETER => then you better pack some for the journey
SUSAN => So were going home?
PETER => You are, I promised I'd keep you three safe but there's no reason I can't stay and help.
LUCY => but they need us...All four of us
PETER => Lucy it's too dangerous. You almost drowned, Edmund was almost killed!
EDMUND => Which is why we have to stay.
EDMUND => I've seen what the White Witch can do and I've helped her do it, and we can't leave these people behind to suffer for it.
SUSAN => Well I guess that's it then. *gets up*
PETER => Where are you going?
SUSAN => To get in some practice.
PETER => Come on Ed, sword hand up like Oreius showed us.
EDMUND => Whoa horsey!
HORSE => My name is Philip.
EDMUND => Oh, sorry
MR. BEAVER => you better come quick the White Witch has requested a meeting with Aslan...
DWARF => Jadis.. Jadis!!!
JADIS => You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.
ASLAN => His offence was not against you.
WHITE WITCH => Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?
ASLAN => Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch. I was there when it was made.
WHITE WITCH => Then you will know that the boy belongs to me.  That boy (points to Edmund) will die on the Stone Table.
PETER => Come and take it then.
WHITE WITCH => You think that a simple threat will deny me my right, little king? Aslan knows that if I do not have blood as the law demands, all of Narnia will be overturned, and perish, in fire and water.
ASLAN => Enough, I shall talk with you alone.
ASLAN => The Witch has denounced her claim on Edmund
WHITE WITCH => How will I know your promise will be kept?
LUCY => Susan!
ASLAN => Aren't you suppose to be in bed?
LUCY => We couldn't sleep
SUSAN => Please, Aslan. Couldn't we come with you?
ASLAN => I would be glad of the company tonight.
ASLAN => It is time. From now on, I must go on alone. Thank you Susan. Thank you Lucy. And farewell.
LUCY =>  Why doesn't he fight back?
WHITE WITCH => Bind him. Wait. First let him be shaved.
WHITE WITCH => Tonight, the Deep magic will be appeased, but tomorrow, we will take Narnia, Forever!
WHITE WITCH => You know, Aslan, I'm a little disappointed in you. Did you really think that by giving your life you would save the Human boy? Ha. You are giving up your life, and saving no one. So much for love.
WHITE WITCH => In that knowledge... Despair... and DIE!!!!!!
WHITE WITCH => The great cat is DEAD!!
WHITE WITCH => General, gather your army and prepare for battle. However short it may be.
SUSAN => It's too late. He's gone. I'm sure he knew what he was doing.
LUCY => We can't just leave him here.
SUSAN => Lucy there's not time. We have to tell the others.
LUCY => The Trees
DRYAD => Fear not my princes. I come with tidings of grave news..
PETER => It is true, he's gone
EDMUND => Then you'll have to lead us. There's a whole army out there waiting to follow you.
PETER => I can't
EDMUND => Aslan believed you could. And so do I.
OREIUS => what are your orders?
GRYPHON => They come, you highness, in numbers and weapons far greater then our own.
OREIUS => Numbers do not win a battle
PETER => No, but I bet they help
WHITE WITCH => I take no interest in prisoners. Kill them all
OTMAN => Look to the sky
PETER => Are you with me?
ORIEUS => To the death!
PETER => FOR NARNIA, AND FOR ASLAN!!!!
SUSAN => We should go.
LUCY => I'm so cold.
LUCY => Susan!
SUSAN => What have they done?
SUSAN => We saw the Witch, the knife.
ASLAN => If the Witch knew the true meaning of sacrifice, she might have interpreted the Deep Magic a little differently. For she would know that if a willing victim who had committed no treachery died in a traitors stead, the Stone Table would crack and death itself would begin to unwind.
SUSAN => We sent the word that you were dead. Peter and Edmund would have gone to war.
LUCY => We have to help them.
ASLAN => We will, but not alone. Now, climb on my back. We have a long ways to go and little time to get there. And you might want to cover your ears. ROAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!
PETER => Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!
BEAVER => That's the signal! Get ready!
EDMUND => FIRE!
PETER => Stop!
LUCY => Susan this is...
SUSAN => MR TUMNUS!!!!
ASLAN => Come, lets search the castle - others may still be trapped inside and Peter will need all the help he can get.
PETER => Ed! There are too many of them! Go! Get out of here! Get the girls, and get them home!
BEAVER => Come on, you heard him!
BEAVER => Peter said to go!
EDMUND => Peter's not King yet!
PETER => Edmund!!
WITCH => Impossible!
ASLAN => It is finished.
SUSAN => Where's Edmund?
SUSAN => Edmund!
PETER => When are you ever going to do are you're told?
ASLAN => Bring forth the crowns!
ASLAN => To the glistening eastern sea, I give you Queen Lucy the Valiant. To the great western woods, King Edmund the Just. To the radiant southern sun, (puts crown on) Queen Susan the Gentle. (crown put on) And to the clear northern skies, King Peter the Magnificent. Once a king or Queen of Narnia, always a king or queen.
EVERYONE => Long live King Peter! Long live Queen Susan! Long live King Edmund! And long live Queen Lucy!
TUMNUS => We'll see him again.
LUCY => When?
TUMNUS => In time...you mustn't press him, He isn't a tame lion...
LUCY => No, but he's good...
TUMNUS => Here I think you need this more than I do.
EDMUND => You alright there Philip?
PHILIP => Not as young as I used to be?
SUSAN => Come on Ed.
EDMUND => Just catching my breath
LUCY => What did he say, Susan?
SUSAN => You girls stay at the castle, I'll go get the stag myself.
PETER => What is this?
SUSAN => It seems like a dream...
LUCY => Or a dream of a dream...Spare Oom
PETER => Not again
LUCY => Come on
EDMUND => She always running off
PETER => These aren't branches...
SUSAN => There coats
ALL => Stop pushing...ah.... (Wardrobe door flies open and all four fall on floor, the door to the room opens and the professor walks in with the ball)
PROFESSOR => There you are. Now what were children doing the wardrobe?
PETER => You wouldn't believe us if we told you (Professor throws ball to Peter and with a twinkle in his eye...)
PROFESSOR => Try me
PROFESSOR => I don't think you'll get back in that way...you see I've already tried.
LUCY => Will we ever go back?
PROFESSOR => I expect so, probably when you least expect it. What's to say Keep your eyes open (They walk out the room and the wardrobe door opens a crack and a light and smoke come out and we hear a roar)
