DOROTHY GENKOS => A seven-speed Mix-o-Meter Food Processor! $21.69!
AVERY => Sweatpants! Two pair! $6.69!
LARRY CROWNE => Three-pack of men's elastic waist mid-thigh boxer shorts! $2.69!
ALVAREZ => Four Toby Jug beer steins - $2.69!
ALL => Shop UniMart! Where United, you save! Larry Crowne leads the High Fives.
MOMMY => Too much mac & cheese for this little pickle bug!
LARRY CROWNE => They do love the comfort food. Don't you, Li'l Pickle Bug... Imagine any duty and see how Larry gets it done...
PIZZA KID => Call a cop, doof. I'm gone in sixty seconds.  You guys having a party?
STRANG => Finally. Dotty G. and her forty-two- K a year are history. Who else would do us that favor?
ANDREWS => Wish they'd all sail off like her. Save us some grief.
STRANG => The "R" Bomb is going to do some collateral damage to this place. Hurley is shocked!
HURLEY => "R-Bomb"? Oh my god! Restructuring?
COX => Separating the chaff from the wheat. Chaff is the bad stuff, right?
COX => Before E.O.Q. Them's our orders. Hurley looks sick. She hates this.
STRANG => What say we drop a brick in the pond to warn the herd?
ANDREWS => How?
STRANG => Firing someone.
COX => Someone they'd never expect to be let go. To look fair. I like it.
STRANG => Like a Team Leader.
HURLEY => Team Leader?
COX => Suggestions on who it should be?
STRANG => I say Crowne.
HURLEY => Larry Crowne? Strang rolls his eyes.
STRANG => Who else? Avery won't retire. We fire him, it's a law suit. AVERY - Old. Black. Happy.
STRANG => Alvarez is about to drop a kid. She'll go part time in a week. ALVAREZ - Heavy with child.
COX => What Salary Tier is Crowne at?
ANDREWS => Top of the pyramid with a C.O.L. bump at the first of the year.
COX => Sweet. We'll need Actionable Cause, of course. They all agree: "Yeah. Sure. Of course..."
COX => How's his review record?
HURLEY => He's a candidate for Employee of the Month. His 22nd time.
COX => Okay. So. Sluggers, gimme a reason... Larry has organized a Limbo Contest.
HURLEY => We could use the Limited Horizons strategy.
COX => You're that familiar with his record?
STRANG => She was his squeeze for a few weeks, weren't you, Vick?
HURLEY => That was before the New Employee Covenants. That you even remember...
STRANG => The memory haunts me.
STRANG => Big brick in the pond, though.
COX => Let's call it. Today, end of shift, UniMart bids Crowne adieu. LARRY is dancing up a storm.
VASQUEZ => LC Why still here?
LARRY CROWNE => Team Leaders zone departments before punching out. It's policy.
VASQUEZ => I mean here here. You just got paged to Meeting Room 2. The P.A. blares again. Now they can hear it -- sort of.
LARRY CROWNE => Probably to clean up after the party.
VASQUEZ => Isn't it Employee of the Month Day? Larry brightens. That is what it must be.
LARRY CROWNE => Speck-tack-alar. Flushed at the prospect, Larry gives Terrorist Fist Bumps.
LARRY CROWNE => Ah, who's counting? He flashes his fingers: twenty two!
LARRY CROWNE => Remember how we saw "The UniMart Way" video, Vick? You and me, alone in this room, and look at us now. Hurley has a frozen face. Larry looks at Andrews' smile.
STRANG => Cubby. Make tracks. The Janitor literally drops everything and leaves
LARRY CROWNE => I think I know what this is about.
STRANG => I don't think you do.
COX => Crowne. At UniMart, we care. So we take care. Which makes moments like these tough for all of us.
LARRY CROWNE => Sounds like you're firing me. Larry is joking.
STRANG => I take it back.
COX => Corporate has mandated a restructuring in all UniMart stores. That's the word they use. I call it a pain in the touchas.
HURLEY => Yeah. A yiddish word.
ANDREWS => Like the buttocks.
HURLEY => Touchas and buttocks. Synonymous.
COX => Hurts to get kicked back there, no matter what language you speak. Larry now gets it.
LARRY CROWNE => UniMart is firing me...
STRANG => Crowne-ie, you did a heck of a job.
LARRY CROWNE => Why me?
ANDREWS => Who do you suggest? Alvarez? Avery? I don't think so.
LARRY CROWNE => Why not Strang? Strang snorts.
LARRY CROWNE => I've been here longer than you, Jack. I started 21 years ago as an Inventory Associate at the store on Euclid. Hurley takes over, as blank as a tax-form.
HURLEY => Seniority would preclude this reality, Larry, but UniMart's policy is to never limit your horizons. Larry Crowne has no idea what that means.
STRANG => Becasue you never went to college you're forever retarded.
LARRY CROWNE => I won't make the Front Office?
STRANG => Never.  S. M. U. Class of '86! Go 'Stangs! It's true.
LARRY CROWNE => I went in the Navy. Right outta high school. Five years, and by then...
COX => Thank you for your service to our country, Larry. And, in total seriousness to UniMart too
LARRY CROWNE => I thought I was Employee of the Month.
STRANG => In a way, you are. Larry can't believe this. Nor can he move.
LARRY CROWNE => No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I'm going to lose my house...
COX => The timing on this is always a bitch.
LARRY CROWNE => Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. Guys. We can fix this. Can't we fix this?
HURLEY => Sign here. Here. Here. Initial that. Sign here. One more. Done. Strang finds one last piece of party pizza.
VASQUEZ => 12 jerks I'd fire before you. May walk away from UniMart myself.
LARRY CROWNE => Stick it out. You go to college?
VASQUEZ => Couple years. Then I blew out my
LARRY CROWNE => Thanks for seeing me off.
VASQUEZ => I need your apron, man.
VASQUEZ => Thanks.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD => Laurie Gammelgaard thank you for holding how may I help you? Larry has to shout over the SCOOTER SQUAD ruckus.
LARRY CROWNE => I was holding for Barry Raphael in Home and Real Estate?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD => Mr. Raphael is no longer with the bank. How can I help you?
LARRY CROWNE => Barry is gone? I need to talk to someone in Home and Real Estate.
LARRY CROWNE =>  I wish! I'm Customer number 566 7878 2031 339 and I can be there in three minutes!
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD => As long as you are here before six, okey dokey. ZZZZZMMMM, BLAARREE... The scooters are gone, but Larry is still yelling...
LARRY CROWNE => Three minutes!
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD => Barry Raphael was harassing the younger tellers but we are not supposed to admit that.
LARRY CROWNE => I m hoping not to lose my house.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD => You're carrying what on the house?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD => Two Ninety-two K. That's trouble. Three years ago I'd have loaned you $700,000, but I think you read the papers.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD => But RiverBank does have a plan for you.
LARRY CROWNE => That's RiverBank's plan for me?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD => It is Friday, Mr. Crowne...
LAMARR => Larry's home a little late tonight. His wife, PATIENCE, is sitting at the table, pouring over catalogs..
PATIENCE => Maybe he was out on a date.
LAMARR => We'd see that on the news. He is about to light up with a match...
PATIENCE => Don't even think about lighting that up in my house.
IRONING BOARD => Unfolds like a piece of high tech assault equipment. The iron breathes hot fumes... spray starch plumes like jet exhaust. Larry Crowne is ironing his nicest shirt and his best khakis to perfection. He is focused. Intense. And good at ironing...
LATER => He gets right back into his car.
LARRY CROWNE => How do I offer this up to Personnel?
PLANET STAFFER => There should be a box to put it in. Larry finds a box.
LARRY CROWNE => This?
PLANET STAFFER => No. There should be another box.
LARRY CROWNE => There isn't.
PLANET STAFFER => That's the one, then. Larry is alone again - ignored as he applies for this job.
LARRY CROWNE => Just following up with an in-person visit.
MR. PATTERSON => Mission accomplished.
LARRY CROWNE => You have a great location here.
MR. PATTERSON => Not with UniMart half a mile away.
LARRY CROWNE => I used to work for UniMart! I could spill you some 411.
MR. PATTERSON => What's that mean?
LARRY CROWNE => I know their trade secrets.
MR. PATTERSON => What secrets? Traffic boosters, loss leaders and bait and switch!
LARRY CROWNE => And I'm ready to learn new strategies. I'll stop by again so you can keep me in mind.
MR. PATTERSON => If you won't work Sundays, don't bother.
LARRY CROWNE => I'll work every day.
MR. PATTERSON => That's what I already do... Mr. Patterson goes back to work as Larry slinks away.
CHEF AMOS => Oh, I remember you. Larry Crowne. I never forget anyone who quits on me.
LARRY CROWNE => As I recall, I gave my notice and worked all my shifts and that was 12 years ago.
CHEF AMOS => As I recall, I had to hire and train a line cook to take your place. Walking out doesn't happen in a vacuum, you know.
RAUL => You come in two weeks ago I would have kissed you on the mouth, but Carlos and Nick, they walked in. Best I can do? Put you at the top of the list. Raul goes back to work.
PERRY => Dang the timing, Kimosabe. Wish I could help you but Raul runs the back.
LARRY CROWNE => Not sure I could work here anyway. The atmosphere is too pleasant and the clientle too A Number 1.
PERRY => Breakfast on the house. Chorizo Scramble, right?
LARRY CROWNE => No charity today. I got things to do.
PERRY => Like what?
LARRY CROWNE => Nothing. I was just saying that.
LAMARR => There's been a yard sale at 1402 Derby Court since Monica Lewinsky! That gives me a monopoly on the location! You go yard on me, Larry Crowne and I will destroy you. He is now standing on Larry's lawn. Larry looks at him. Got fired yesterday.
LAMARR => Bloody Friday. Security sees you off, by the time Monday comes around the fired man is the forgotten man. Diabolical.
LARRY CROWNE => They said it's because I didn't go to college.
LAMARR => Smoke screen. The Man just wanted you gone.  You liquidating assets to raise cash?
LARRY CROWNE => Buying out Denise's half of the house was the worst advice, ever.
LAMARR => I'll tell you straight up - I'm not lending you money.
or sale. => Inside his garage? Clothes and books - racks and shelves.
PATIENCE => Whole box of Cha-Cha records from the Fifties. You don't have any of these, I promise.
LAMARR => He can't afford 'em Lost his job
PATIENCE => No! UniMart just lost my business forever!
LARRY CROWNE => I love you too.
PATIENCE => Sorry, Lie-bare-eye-bee. Get a better job somewhere so you can crush them.
LARRY CROWNE => Hard to do.
LAMARR => He's going to get something better than a job.
LARRY CROWNE => Aren't there unemployed engineers and geophysicists?
PATIENCE => Listen to my husband. Hasn't called a man boss in years. Paid off the house.
LARRY CROWNE => You won the Lottery.
PATIENCE => Picked 8 little numbers when I kept saying he was a fool. A quarter million dollars later I've shut up.
LAMARR => Lost half to taxes.
LARRY CROWNE => I'll see if there's a class in here for PowerBall 250.
LAMARR => That's half a buck for the book.
LARRY CROWNE => They give these away free.
LAMARR => They do. I don't.
highlights. => Larry wants to shoot himself in the head. Instead, he picks up the catalog of East City College....
BUSIK => Back to college, huh?
LARRY CROWNE => First time. I was in the Navy.
LARRY CROWNE => Galley Mate.
BUSIK => We teach a whole track in Hotel and Restaurant Food Preparation.
LARRY CROWNE => No. No, no. I need an all-new career and a place to go everyday.
BUSIK => Those two things are my specialty. HALLWAY -- walking towards Busik's cubicle.
BUSIK => First thing. Bravo for choosing East City College. Never too late for an education. Second, you need a jolt to the confidence machinery. He grabs a folder...
BUSIK => I am going to change your life. 
LARRY CROWNE => Is this Public Speaking?
BUSIK => It's training. Job interviews will be a breeze with the confidence you'll get from Speech Two One Seven.  And you'll spend three hours a week with the most attractive package in all of Academia. The Golden Girl of East City.
GPS VOICE => Please Enter your destination.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I'm here. Shut up. Turn off! Stepping from her sub-compact, she struggles into a pair of heels, as in this state she drives barefoot. If only her huge Thermo-cup held a hair of the dog she might not walk such a crooked mile from the parking lot to the campus. Larry -- in his car -- screeches around a corner. He is frantically looking for a place to park, but as this is the first day of term, the lot is jammed! He nearly hits Mercedes Tainot.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Jerk!
LARRY CROWNE => Sorry! Parking's impossible today!
LARRY CROWNE => New to the Student Body.
MERCEDES TAINOT => This is the Faculty Lot. We've earned degrees for these spaces. Students park on Mars.
LARRY CROWNE => I'm going to be late for my first day of school.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I bet it won't be the first time.
MERCEDES TAINOT => This is it?
MERCEDES TAINOT => My day has just been made and it's only 8:02 in the morning!
LARRY CROWNE => Please tell me this is Speech 217. Mercedes drops her bag on her desk. She is crushed and hates Larry Crowne. She takes up some chalk, turns to the board, then writes in large, shaky-yet-feminine script:
MERCEDES TAINOT => While earning a Masters in Shakespearean Political Discourse from Vassar, I learned to care. Caring is a prerequisite for this class I have to teach in this
MERCEDES TAINOT => Participate. Show up on time.  Care. And stay awake the 55 minutes three dawns a week I have to be here, or I will fail you and not care.  My name is Ms. Tainot. Not 'tie- knot'. Tay-no. You will each address the class on Wednesday. A procedure. How. To do. Something. Pinedo has panic in her eyes. Public speaking terr fies her. Dibiasi raises his hand.
DIBIASI => Ms. Tie-knot? Ms. Tainot glares at Dibiasi. Glares and glares at him.
DIBIASI => Uh, Tay-knot...Tai-bo...
DIBIASI => Steve Dibiasi. Friends call me Nomad. Only two days before I gotta get up and give my address? You may be dreaming.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Why are you here, Steve?
DIBIASI => Counsellor Busik said this class would change my life.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Busik. Of course... Dibiasi's cell phone rings.
DIBIASI => I gotta take this... Mercedes Tainot may kill this kid.
LARRY CROWNE => Look at us, in two classes in a row.
PINEDO => Yes. Hi.
LARRY CROWNE => That Ms. Tainot is something else isn't she? I'm new to this coll ge life and, I confess, she sca es e This whole place scares me.
PINEDO => Yes.
LARRY CROWNE => I'm sorry. Larry Crowne, and I'm babbling.
PINEDO => I am Lala.
DR. MATSUTANI => I order you to turn off all cell phones, smart phones, and any phone- like devices! The teacher comes in - DR. MATSUTANI.
DR. MATSUTANI => You have entered The Knowledge Zone!! Econ Prime! One textbook!  Written by? Ed Matsutani, PhD. That's me! Read this book Follow into the Promised Land!
DR. MATSUTANI => (he laughs mock
MANIACALLY) => That usually scares people. Yet none of you have fled. A good economic indicator. Larry leans over to Lala.
LARRY CROWNE => I like this guy...
PINEDO => Yes...
begin. => Mercedes has already written up on the board in Happy Letters
DO!!!" => But no one else is showing up.
gas pipe. => A body builder on a SCOOTER -- a guy we will come to know as DELL GORDO -- pulls in to the opposite pump. He flips up the seat, pops the pump into his scooter tank, and in seconds, is done. That scooter only sips gasoline. Off Dell goes, while Larry's tank fills and fills and fills...
LAMARR => What's cookin' Joe College?
LARRY CROWNE => Money woes. Paying for gas, getting to school.
LAMARR => Come with me.
LAMARR => Passing through, woman... Lamarr goes through the patio doors to the back yard, a space filled with even more yard sale items.
PATIENCE => Larry Crowne, been thinking about you. Sit down here... Larry watches Vanna White turn letters - he solves the puzzle.
LARRY CROWNE => "College Graduate."
PATIENCE => That's going to be you someday. She's pulled up some LP's on eBay on the computer.
PATIENCE => You have money in all those records. If you can part with them, they'd go for something on the eBay. I'll show you how... From the back patio, Lamarr comes in pushing a scooter in not too bad of shape, though its windscreen is faded.
LAMARR => This what you're talking about?
LARRY CROWNE => That's a hunk of junk.
LAMARR => This is classic.
LARRY CROWNE => It doesn't work.
LAMARR => It will for eight hundred dollars.
LAMARR => Seven hundred.
LARRY CROWNE => Two hundred.
LAMARR => Six fifty.
LARRY CROWNE => Two hundred.
LAMARR => Six thirty.
PATIENCE => Gonna be a long night with you two.
LARRY CROWNE => Forget it.
LAMARR => Larry! The secret of any negotiation is for both of us to win Talk to me How much do you
LAMARR => Beautiful. I'll throw in a helmet.
LARRY CROWNE => All I need is the open road. Larry revs it, crashes into a hedge.
LAMARR => You break it, you bought it.
LAMARR => Talking about the hedge.
COMPUTER SCREEN => Images of an EROTIC SUPER-HEROINE -- busty and hot -- and others, are being studied, and saved one after another.
DEAN TAINOT => Well, hey! Who's home early! He keeps clicking away with the mouse until he's safe. Mercedes calls from the other room.
DEAN TAINOT => First day of term calls for a celebration!
MERCEDES TAINOT => You'd think so.
DEAN TAINOT => What's your burden this go round?
MERCEDES TAINOT => Tap Dancing. Ping Pong. Water Torture. And Speech at Sunrise
DEAN TAINOT => I built a Flamethrower of a posting for WarriorWeb which, if I do say, will feed nicely as an outline for
DEAN TAINOT => Y u don't believe me.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Why wouldn't I believe you?
DEAN TAINOT => I was composing, Mercy. That's what I do all day.
MERCEDES TAINOT => You were looking at porn. She takes a nice pull on that icy drink. Oh fine. Thought Police. I saw some erotica. I'm a man, I admit it.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Took you a while.
DEAN TAINOT => It's barely porn. I'm not hiding it.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Yes you are. She bangs her head.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Brain freeze.
DEAN TAINOT => Don't chug. Sip.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I have no secrets from you. I share the whole miserable slate.
DEAN TAINOT => You walked in the door pissed off because -- I'm sorry -- I've
DEAN TAINOT => It may look like I don't work hard around here, Mercy. But I do. I'm just a guy who's a guy being a guy when you're not around... She walks away.
DEAN TAINOT => And walking away is great for a relationship...
thinks/drinks. => Rap-rap-rap on the glass door. It's Dean, making one last point.
RIDER => How you doing...
LARRY CROWNE => Speck-tack-alar.
RIDER => Work.
LARRY CROWNE => School. College. I'm a student. What do you do?
RIDER => I'm a gynecologist.
LARRY CROWNE => Yeah? I'd say 'have a great day' but that would be stating the
LARRY CROWNE => You take care. As the Rider takes off, Larry tries to do the same, but he stalls the engine. Cars honk horns at him.
TALIA => Where'd you get the Hot Wheels? Talia is shaking her hair free from her helmet. Larry fails to recognize her from Econ prime.
TALIA => That machine's a classic.
TALIA => You're in Matsutani's Econ with me.
LARRY CROWNE => I am?
TALIA => That class is straining my coconut.
LARRY CROWNE => It's only been one day
TALIA => Didn't know you scooted.
LARRY CROWNE => New to the sport.
TALIA =>  Give me your number. I'll introduce you to like-minded enthusiasts.
LARRY CROWNE => Larry Crowne. With an 'e'.
TALIA => 'Larry'? I don't think so. I used to be Kathleen but one day I looked in the mirror and saw a girl named Talia.  Putting you in as 'Lance'. Check your texts and we'll do us some scooting.
LARRY CROWNE => Not much fashion sense.
TALIA => I know! Gotta change that... Larry sees Mercedes Tainot walking from the Faculty lot, and doesn't want to be late again.
TALIA => Then get going!! Talia watches him go. Likes him thus far...
CALIMERIS => With the push-up added, the 4-count Burpie becomes the 6-count Burpie and works out the pecs and biceps. It's an all-in-one exercise perfect for Cheerleader conditioning. The
MERCEDES TAINOT => We now all know how to Burpie. Thank you.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Make me the bad guy.
LARRY CROWNE => You mean me?
MERCEDES TAINOT => Mr. Crowne. My bad. Larry goes to the podium - armed with a huge stack of 3x5's.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Go.
LARRY CROWNE => My presentation will be on the subject of a very particular procedure. "How to make French Toast", but I'll speak English... Larry has used up one card. Mercedes rolls her eyes and talks to herself in a MOVIE DEVICE way...
MERCEDES TAINOT => M classes were once filled with e rnest young men ready to learn all I had to teach them. Cute boys fresh out of High School who all had crushes on me from day one. Now look at my cadre. Dibiasi. Bound for jail. Mack. Treating college like another tour of combat. Crowne. If this was Hamlet, he'd be Osric in Act 5. The part that is always cut.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Busik, I am going to kill you. You can't suggest these saps take Shorthand or Oral Hygiene? Bring me in at this ungodly hour for 2 minutes on French toast? Busik looks at Mercedes, signals a 'not bad, eh?' about Larry. She is a stone face.
LARRY CROWNE => Most people think syrup comes out of a plastic bottle.
MERCEDES TAINOT =>  Great. The history of the sugar maple tree now. Thank you Wikipedia. Larry still has a dozen cards to go.
LARRY CROWNE => That went fast...
MERCEDES TAINOT => Breakfast may never be ready. Larry gathers his cards. Busik gives him a 'bravo!'
MERCEDES TAINOT => Next. Pinedo tries to volunteer to go next...
DIBIASI => I'll go. But you aren't going to like it.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Are you clairvoyant?
DIBIASI => (holding a pack of Toaster
BUSIK => Simple. Direct. Informative.
DR. MATSUTANI => Your mobile, please. Larry hands it over.
DR. MATSUTANI => I will return it after class if I don't crush it first.
LATER => Some of the Scooter Gang have assembled as Larry and Talia walk up. DELL GORDO and STAN are talking about today's route.
TALIA => Hey Monkey! Dell Gordo plants a kiss right on Talia's lips. She kisses him back. Larry sinks a little.
TALIA => This is Lance Corona. Classmate and good guy, so far.
DELL GORDO => Dell Gordo. You want to ride with us?
LARRY CROWNE => Why not. There is a beat of a stare down between Dell Gordo and Larry, but then Dell starts to snap his fingers -- SNAP...SNAP...SNAP... -- the other join in until they are all snapping fingers like the Jets vs. Sharks. Talia too.
TALIA => Snap along, Lance or you can't join the gang. Larry, clumsily, starts snapping too. After a few bars...
STAN => Not many of these '66 Wasps left around. They had low torque. How's the torque? He means Larry's scooter.
LARRY CROWNE => I just bought it and ride around. Someone yells "Saddle up!"
TALIA => Stan knows engines and junk.
DELL GORDO => Let's go, Sweets!
TALIA => We ride, Monkey! Larry's heart breaks a tiny bit, suffering as he does from Talia-on-the-heart.
always. => They make riding look fun... being in a group a gas... rolling with the wind in your hair something you'd like to do...
UNIMART => As Larry and the Squad pass it by, Larry can't help but eye the place he once worked. He sees staffers collecting carts in the parking lot. He misses that place...
LARRY CROWNE => Other than school, I have nothing to do.
DELL GORDO => Let's troll Buena Vista for junk stores.
STAN => We hit those last week.
TALIA => If it was Saturday we'd look for yard sales.
LARRY CROWNE => I know where a yard sale is, like everyday.
TALIA => Lead the way.
DELL GORDO => Take point!
LARRY CROWNE => Follow me, boys and girl!
LAMARR => We're being invaded! One by one, the Scooters park and survey the scene. The stuff that Larry was selling is now part of Lamarr's operation, being sold 'On Consignment'. .
LAMARR => Larry, what kind of thugs you get in with?
LARRY CROWNE => College buddies.
TALIA => You have any old clothes?
LAMARR => Speak to my bride inside. Dell Gordo, Stan and the others are going through hardware, tools, appliances.
DELL GORDO => Oh man! These TV trays are too much!
LAMARR => Bargains at $100 apiece.
DELL GORDO => For these? Are you nuts?
LAMARR => I'm joking, kid. Let's get to haggling.
YOU => Ninety-nine dollars apiece. see how this is working?
DELL GORDO => Two bucks apiece!
LAMARR => Ninety-eight and, kid, I do this every day.
TALIA => Layer this... with this.
TALIA => I LOVE THIS! Where did you GET IT?
PATIENCE => Reeled it in like tuna from the Atlantic.
TALIA => Diamonds in a diamond mine.
PATIENCE => You and I are going to spend some time together!
TALIA => I gotta see Chez Lance.
LARRY CROWNE => Entrez vous, sea food plate. Talia enters and looks around. The decor screams out: "A man lives here."
TALIA => No sign of a woman around here for years. Drape a scarf over that
TALIA => Alphabetical order. No artistic chaos for you. She closes her eyes and picks out an LP at random.
TALIA => Spin this platter, Mr. DJ?
LARRY CROWNE => Good choice. As he puts it on, Talia drifts into the...
TALIA => Breakfast nookie!
TALIA => Did Denise make you breakfast in here with a little apron and lipstick perfectly applied?
LARRY CROWNE => I did most of the cooking, actually.
TALIA => Patience thought she was stuck up and seriously fleeced you. Larry can't believe his neighbors are so loose-tongued.
TALIA => So what happened there, my Lance?
LARRY CROWNE => The usual stuff between three people.
LARRY CROWNE => Dark.
TALIA => Like me.
LARRY CROWNE => Stay outta my way.
LARRY CROWNE => Cooking for friends is sort of fun. Three hundred times a day is not.
DELL GORDO => That corn bread I smell?
TALIA => Kitchen, Monkey! Dell Gordo has walked into Larry's house.
DELL GORDO => Corn pone! Dell Gordo dives in after helping himself to a bottle of beer from the refrigerator.
DELL GORDO => You're like Uncle Ben or something. Stan's working on your bike.
LARRY CROWNE => He is? Larry goes to the window.
DELL GORDO => Said the thing was a time bomb. He's saving your life.
DELL GORDO => Let's go lift iron, Monkey. It's a shoulders and arms day
DELL GORDO => Lance, raise your right hand and say something patriotic. Larry does, just for fun.
LARRY CROWNE => 'We'll be right back after these messages.'
DELL GORDO => You're in the Street Patrol. A full-time mission for beauty and justice. Talia throws her arms around him and kisses him on the lips -- no romance at all, but still...
TALIA => That Denise. What a fool. You a e way cooler than you appear. She leaves. Dell Gordo lingers.
LARRY CROWNE => Capice.
DELL GORDO => Seriously. Don't make me keep my eyes on you. What's your real name?
LARRY CROWNE => L rry.
DELL GORDO => Mine's Don. Shake hands.
LARRY CROWNE => Peace indeed.
LARRY CROWNE => Speck-tack-alar. He peels out, on his way to school.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => Even business can break down into a Shakespearean Five-Act Structure!
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => Act I: Inventory. What do you sell? Act Two? To Market. Reach your buyers. Act Three? Three legs of accounting. Receivable. Payable. Due. Act Four? Forward planning. Plan to grow. Act Five? Final Profitability. What do you clear on bottom-line?
hands. => Dibiasi is doodling drawings of football players.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => For business, social, and self- improvement workshops, email me: Francestaylor-briegh@dynasem.com. Mercedes Tainot is in the back -- her mind far from her classroom. She is preoccupied. The applause for the speaker jolts her.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Did you notice? No script. No notes. So it can be done. The class breaks up. Pinedo makes it a point to pick up some DynaSem brochures. Larry remains, scribbling notes.
MERCEDES TAINOT => White, Siler and Koss, you are up
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => Anything for the woman who brought out the public speaker in Frances Taylor-Briegh.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Mr Crowne? Can you move along
LARRY CROWNE => That was a great presentation. I learned a lot from it.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => Super.
LARRY CROWNE => Smart stuff. Super smart. The women watch him go. As soon as he's out the door:
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => Ethel's here, Lucy. What's going on?
MERCEDES TAINOT => When was the last time you looked at your life and saw nothing but fraud and desperation?
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => Mercy. You're an idol to me. Hearing you talk like that is
MERCEDES TAINOT => Well I'm joking of course!!! She pretends to laugh. A little too much.
DR. MATSUTANI => If the balance on Axis A is the same metric as Axis B you're in deficits because of overhead, taxes, and re-investment.
TALIA => Something complicated.
DR. MATSUTANI => Ms. Pinedo?
DR. MATSUTANI => Mr. Crowne?
LARRY CROWNE => Breaking even is not making profit, it's a theoretical assumption. Economics abhors an assumption. Talia is amused while sizing him up, from shoe to collar. Bad shirt... pleated pants, too short... running shoes.
DR. MATSUTANI => Someone's been reading my book.
LARRY CROWNE => So what happens here?
TALIA => You ready? Re-invention Big Boy
LARRY CROWNE => I have no idea what that means, but you betcha.
LARRY CROWNE => Holy smokes! The place is crammed with vintage clothes. Racks and boxes and stacks of every fashion.
LARRY CROWNE => You got inventory. She disappears in the back, rummaging around.
TALIA => I started in the smallest unit.
TALIA => No one should ever buy clothes off the internet. You have to feel the fabric and test the drape...
LARRY CROWNE => What is all this worth? Out she ome with an assortment of men's clothes.
TALIA => A lot to me. Try these on.
LARRY CROWNE => Where?
TALIA => Anywhere. Fashion is no place for modesty. Strip. He does.
TALIA => This is a service to humankind, Lance. It hurts me to see a Top Cat dressed like an ex-hockey player. You gotta look gorgeous from shoe to collar. Starting now. Larry is taking off his pants just as Dell Gordo has pulled up on his scooter.
DELL GORDO => Monkey! Thought you might be here.
TALIA => Lance! My boyfriend's here! Put your pants on! Larry, in fact, has his pants off.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Go to hell...
HE'S => Candles. Flowers. In other words, he's making up.
DEAN TAINOT => No argument here, Mercy. Fact: I'm a dope. Fact: My wife is beautiful and brilliant. And I will be a good boy from now on. Why? Because you're right and I've learned my lesson. Just don't be mad at me forever. I have a pliable soul and I pray you do too
DEAN TAINOT => Ah. That was nice.
MERCEDES TAINOT => It was. Yes.
DEAN TAINOT => Been thinking. If you ever want to take a whack at writing something -- say a blog a couple of times a week -- I could help you out.
MERCEDES TAINOT => How?
DEAN TAINOT => I'd read your stuff. Make comments to make it web-savvy. Pieces need
MERCEDES TAINOT => Okay.
DEAN TAINOT => See? You can't stay mad at me. No reason to be mad at me... He smooches her. Mercedes smooches back.
DEAN TAINOT => I'm just a guy who's a guy being a guy... Mercedes' eyes: She didn't like hearing that...
DENISE => This is Denise. How can I help you.
LARRY CROWNE => Denise. Larry.
DENISE => My god. Larry Crowne. I remember you.
LARRY CROWNE => This a good time?
DENISE => Other than me being at work?
LARRY CROWNE => I'll call you later.
DENISE => I'm surprised is all. What do you want? With checkbooks, statements, etc. Larry is looking for the bottom line.
LARRY CROWNE => Well. Okay. Uh. Here's the deal.
DENISE => Spit it, Lar.
LARRY CROWNE => I'm going to miss a few months on the checks for the house.
DENISE => Okay.
LARRY CROWNE => I hoped not to, but I there it is.
DENISE => Okay. Yeah.
LARRY CROWNE => I'm sorry.
DENISE => How many months?
LARRY CROWNE => Let's start with six. Silence on the other end.
DENISE => That can't happen, Larry. I'm extended. I've put a deposit down on the first vacation I've had in 5 1/2 years. My expenses are as valid as yours, so I need the checks like always. A deal's a deal. He goes back to the computer, to eBay to see how his LP auction is going. One record is going for... $0.75. Another: $1.25. Another:
DENISE => That's not my problem. Take out a loan on the house or something.
LARRY CROWNE => I tried. I'm too much of a risk.
DENISE => Oh, I'm not touching that. I don't want to open up the whole lawyer thing, but I will if pushed. Sucks, doesn't it? I appreciate the rigorous Crowne honesty, but this can't happen.
PERRY => Can I smell trouble or what?
RAUL => Can you speak English?
PERRY => Those two over in booth 6... P.O.V.: Two GUYS IN SUITS.
PERRY => Homeland Security. I piped thei badges and everything.
RAUL => What is Homeland Security doing here... Raul looks back in the kitchen. Carlos and Nick are prepping their stations. Raul bolts for the kitchen. In seconds we can see him through
as... => Out side the window, Carlos and Nick are fleeing for their Illegal Alien lives...
INTERCUT/PERRY'S => Perry is serving hotcakes to the Agents while Raul is on the phone.
RAUL => This is Larry Crowne?
LARRY CROWNE => Raul? Yes.
RAUL => Get your ass down here. You got a job.
LARRY CROWNE => I do?
PERRY => We're swamped, Kimosabe. Get back there!
RAUL => You're late on your first day!
RAUL => Where you learn to turn eggs like
LARRY CROWNE => The USS Coral Sea.
RAUL => So don't.
LARRY CROWNE => I gotta get to class before I miss the whole day. And I can't work mornings Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays.
RAUL => Soon as the rush is finished, go. I'll get my idiot brother-in-law three days a week. You take evenings. Deal?
LARRY CROWNE => Deal. When will we talk salary?
MACK => These are not toys. Nobody 'plays' with these. These are kept behind glass, so no way am I passing them around today. Mercedes TALKS to us and HERSELF.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Wait a ding dong minute.  1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9. Someone is missing! Who cut my class? She lets slip OUT LOUD:
MERCEDES TAINOT => Where's Larry Crowne?! Everyone looks at her.
MACK => Guess Larry's out today.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Anyone know why?
MACK => He didn't call me. Ad-libs: no one knows why Larry is out.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I don't believe this! Ditching me? He ditched me? Not okay. Larry Crowne, you are on my Shit List. Everyone shares looks like they've witnessed a Lover's Spat. Speaking quietly in their seats...
DIBIASI => Sounds like Teacher has a thing for a Teach-ee.
PINEDO => I do too.  He's a nice man. Mack speaks up.
MACK => Should I continue?
MERCEDES TAINOT => Yes. Tell us more about your man dolls. Mack is humiliated now.
MACK => I'm sure everyone recognizes Boba Fett...
DR. MATSUTANI => This is college, Mr. Crowne. The only thing you can't do is smoke in the building. Hand over your phone.
PINEDO => Without mooting the quarterlies. I know.
LARRY CROWNE => Then say it.
PINEDO => Can I?
PINEDO => To up... met... es without ...ing ...terly predicts....? No one understood that...
DR. MATSUTANI => I know what you mean, but please share it with your classmates?
DR. MATSUTANI => Does this affect the Value Index?
DR. MATSUTANI => Someone is doing the reading! Lala Pinedo beams! Larry applauds. Talia whoops!
MERCEDES TAINOT => Is that Larry Crowne!?
LARRY CROWNE => I'm sorry, Ms. Tainot. I will not miss another class, this I vow.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Vows come cheap, Larry Crowne. You'll lead off next assignment with three minutes on a personal first. A story, with details, not a laundry list or slide show. And, as I told Dibiasi, no one wants to hear about the first time you got laid. She eyes Talia with venom in her eyes.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Or the most recent. Talia laughs out loud!
TALIA => That woman is one clenched fist of fury.
TALIA => She must not be having any amok lovin'.
TALIA => Without a workout in the Inner Sanctum a few times a week I can't concentrate.
LARRY CROWNE => Inappropriate subject in mixed company.
TALIA => You you want to fix it with your teacher? Bang her. Talia slides a photo of herself making a face into Larry's wallet, then adds a condom in its foil.
LARRY CROWNE => She's marred.
TALIA => You'd kill two birds in one bush. Nothing wrong with a campus romance. Otherwise life is what? Breakfast work, coffee, school, lunch, scoot, class, shop, talk, Mexican food, a movie, glass of wine or two then bed? That's not living.
TALIA => Bet she'd give you an A plus.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD => More complimentary coffee?
LARRY CROWNE => Complimentary coffee is usually lousy.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD => I drink it all day.
LARRY CROWNE => I got a job.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD => Atta Baby!
LARRY CROWNE => Perry's Coffee shop. Breakfast all day. And I'm going to school.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD => At East City. I see.  Larry, this doesn't change anything.
LARRY CROWNE => I was afraid of that.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD => The interest alone will eat up your service industry salary.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD => Okay.
LARRY CROWNE => I can't make the payments on the house. I'm going to lose it, aren't I?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD => Stop with the gloomy puss. You're doing everything right. Hang in there. You still have a friend at RiverBank.
LARRY CROWNE => You guys are forced to say that, aren't you?
RAIN! => Coming down in buckets. Talia has the grate up, wrapping a new outfit for Larry culled from her supply. Dell Gordo is in a rain slicker.
DELL GORDO => I think it's letting up.
TALIA => It's going to storm till next year.
DELL GORDO => We can't stay here all day. Find a raincoat and let's get a little wet.
TALIA => I do not scoot in the rain.
TALIA => My savior! Look at your new schmatas.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I got engaged to a teacher/writer with two books in print...
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => I never read them.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Who did? I'm married to an ex- teacher turned blogger with two books in print. And oh, yes, he has the libido and internet access of a 13-year-old.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => I had a boyfriend who owned every movie Sophia Loren ever made. I d hear a DVD go into the playe an knew what I was going to be doing in a half-hour. Right next to them, Larry Crowne pulls up in his Karmann Ghia with the top up and Talia in the passenger seat.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => Othello. Act 1. Scene 1. Iago to Roderigo. Talia jumps out and runs into the donut shop.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Why can't all my students be like y u?
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => Because, as I learned in your class, I am one of a kind. Larry rolls down his window and yells something funny to her. He never sees Mercedes or Frances.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => Hey, that guy's in your class. Mercedes wipes fog off the window.
P.O.V. => Talia is talking to the Donut Shop Lady, selecting crullers and old-fashioneds.
MERCEDES TAINOT => And that Toy Poodle he keeps on a leash! Mercedes eyes Larry in his car.
MERCEDES TAINOT => That's why he's in college! To get laid!
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => It happens. Talia comes running out, with two coffees and a bag of donuts, hops into Larry's car and they pull out as Talia puts a ring of sweet into his mouth. Mercedes rolls down her window and yells.
DIBIASI => Woah! Larry Crowne, I didn't know you were gay. You've gone all Project Runway on us. Mercedes enters, eyeing Larry with residual venom. He is oblivious. She takes her listening post in the back of the room as the class goes quiet.
LARRY CROWNE => Should I begin? Mercedes signals 'Yeah, go ahead, asshole.'
LARRY CROWNE => first crossing of the Equator...
MERCEDES TAINOT => (talking to herself in the MOVIE
DEVICE WAY) => Oh shut up you sleaze. Jerk.
DIBIASI =>  What? What he say?
LARRY CROWNE => Unless you're looking at a chart, you don't even know the Equator when you cross it...
MERCEDES TAINOT => A repackaged Larry Crowne won't fool me. Shame on you. Going after jail bait, you criminal. Insert Viagra joke here...
MERCEDES TAINOT => Anyone recall anything from that?
PINEDO => That Larry believed there were signs on posts marking the Equator.
CALIMERIS => And that, when it's a first time, they make the rookies dress in drag and sing Abba songs? Mercedes missed a lot of that. Everything, in f ct.
MACK => Larry worked on an Aircraft Carrier! Night Carrier Landings are the trickiest flying in world. Mercedes is learning this for the first time as well.
MERCEDES TAINOT => That was a memorable nugget.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Mr. Koss to the lectern, please. More anecdotes come from the class about Larry's speech. Mercedes heard none of them...
TALIA => Chef Corona! Steam us some corn bread? The others pretend to be grumpy diners: Feed us! What's a Reuben Sandwich? Where's my Sanka!
TALIA => Woman on deck! Raul looks up from his Spanish Language Newspaper.
RAUL => You can't come in here.
TALIA => I'm a friend of Lance's.
RAUL => No Lance works for me. Talia hops up to sit on a butcher block.
RAUL => This is my kitchen and I am the boss.
TALIA => Is he, Lance?
TALIA => Rah-ool. Rhymes with ya-cool. Are ya' cool, Raul?
RAUL => Sure I'm cool. Tough but fair, too.
TALIA => As boss, do you make up the menu?
TALIA => Is that a tough but fair job?
LATER => Talia is with Perry at the register. She's seduced him now, as he goes over the menu and what sells more than ever.
PERRY => Breakfast all day, see. From Corn Flakes to popovers. We make the best Chicken Fried Steak outside of a truck stop.
TALIA => Can Lance take a break?
PERRY => Who?
TALIA => The artist formerly known as Larry. I need his expertise.
LARRY CROWNE => Square footage at this price is a bargain.
TALIA => Maurice says I'm saving his life by renting the space.
TALIA => You sure?
LARRY CROWNE => Chapter four.
TALIA => You make it sound so simple!! Talia is so excited she grabs Larry and showers his forehead with kisses. Appearing out of nowhere: Dell Gordo.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I'm smiling...
DEAN TAINOT => Like The Joker after three Apple Martinis.
MERCEDES TAINOT => If they help, they help.
DEAN TAINOT => We can't even have a Date Night now? You can't even chillax for one meal?
MERCEDES TAINOT => "Chillax?" Did you use the word "chillax?" That come from your Bloggers Thesaurus?
GPS VOICE => Please Enter your destination.
MERCEDES TAINOT => You lie to me, Dean. Every day. You. Lie. To. Me.
DEAN TAINOT => You looking for a whole new man, Mercy? I'm the jerk who has to transform into Ultraman to make you happy? No. I like myself, Mercy. I put up with you and complain about nothing.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I'm not complaining. I'm stating the truth. I teach while you pretend to work.
DEAN TAINOT => I had three postings today alone. FogCaster, SkyScan, and ParsecTwelve.com
DEAN TAINOT => Hey, Booze-illa, who are you to judge me?
DEAN TAINOT => Maybe I should take that back.
JANET => As soon as I saw you, I said, "I want to go out with that man."
TONY => What did you say when I asked you out?
JANET => I said "Yes." You were there, remember?
TONY => I saw you and I thought "I would be a lucky guy if she'd go out with me."
JANET => Yes you are.
TONY => Honestly, this is about as good a first date goes, isn't it?
TONY => Hold that thought. Dean and Mercy pull up beside them in their car.
DEAN TAINOT => I take it back. I take it back.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Drive, asshole! Drive away!
DEAN TAINOT => I've been drinking, too.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Drive straight til you hit a cliff on the coastline!
DEAN TAINOT => You win! I'm letting you win! Everything you say is right and
MERCEDES TAINOT => LOSER! I MARRIED A LOSER!!! With a tiny dick! Tiny dick LOSER!
DEAN TAINOT => Screw you, you washboard!
MERCEDES TAINOT => Oh, chillax!!!
GPS VOICE => Please enter your destination. Dean screeches off into the night. Mercedes picks up a rock and hurls it at him.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I'm throwing rocks at my own car !! Janet and Tony are aghast - silent - in shock.
MERCEDES TAINOT => The jerk who just deserted me? My husband of 4 friggin' years! She stomps off into the night. Janet and Tony don't know what to do with each other now.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I loved these shoes once. Stupid shoes. She sits at he stop, about to cry. Then she sort of does cry, for so any reasons. In the distance, we hear...
'Scoot'. => All the REGULARS go by. Somewhere in the mix are Larry and Talia. Talia is just able to turn her head and see Ms. Tainot at the bus stop. She slows.
TALIA => Lance! Chick alert! Larry is beside her. They stop.
TALIA => You are not going to believe how Fate meets cute! She u-turns and Larry follows her, confused.
LARRY CROWNE => Ms. Tainot?
MERCEDES TAINOT => No. He takes off his helmet.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Jesus Christ.
TALIA => And I've been calling you 'Lance'.
LARRY CROWNE => Do you need a ride? Hop on.
MERCEDES TAINOT => And bust up your romp in the glen with Bambi?
TALIA => Hey. Bambi was a boy.
LARRY CROWNE => I was heading home.
TALIA => Not me. I love riding in the night. Magic happens.
MERCEDES TAINOT => What do men see in irritating free spirits? Mercedes starts walking.
LARRY CROWNE => Seriously. I offer you a ride.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Seriously. I don't want one. Larry shuts off his scooter, pushing it along with his feet
LARRY CROWNE => I've yet to give anyone a lift on this but I think I can get you home with a scraped elbow, worst case.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I am walking, Crowne, as thoughts black boil up from my soul. Major
LARRY CROWNE => An attractive woman like you walking alone is a dumb idea.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I need a man flirting with me right now like I need a dog crapping on my lawn. I'm hoofing it.
LARRY CROWNE => In those shoes? Mercedes ponders her shoes. He's got her. She stops.
MERCEDES TAINOT => A man who notices shoes.
LARRY CROWNE => Put this on.
MERCEDES TAINOT => It won't be a terrible thing if you kill us both.
LARRY CROWNE => Ain't you a ball of fun? Larry kick starts the scooter and off they go -- slowly.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Are you really going to go this slow?
LARRY CROWNE => I do want to survive this night.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Fine. I have time to window shop. Oh look, a sale on tires at AutoUSA. And here comes a mailbox. I've never noticed their perfect design and colo scheme. This is
LARRY CROWNE => Where am I taking you?
MERCEDES TAINOT => Down to Portola and left to Havenhurst. Havenhurst to Palermo. Right on Palermo till I yell stop.
LARRY CROWNE => I may use this as a presentation in class.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Try it and you'll flunk. I am joking.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
LARRY CROWNE => I like your class. You're making us all do things we never thought we could.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Put the shovel away and just get me home, 'kay? Up ahead, flashing lights.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Hail our City's Finest.
LARRY CROWNE => Someone's getting pinched... A COP CAR with its cherry top flashing, has pulled over a Drunk Driver. It's Dean. They're making him touch his nose, breathe into a test kit. Mercedes starts laughing.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Measure his dick, officer! He's too diminutive to drive!
LARRY CROWNE => Bad night for that guy.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Best night I've had in years! Drive on, McDuff!
LARRY CROWNE => Unit 114.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Thanks for the ox-cart ride. Like a sleepwalker. Stands at the Alarm Pad.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I can see the Alarm Pad. I know the code. But my hands aren't working.
LARRY CROWNE => You don't want to give me your pass code.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Look away now.
MERCEDES TAINOT => W ere's my purse? Oh yeah. My car. The key please? It's buried in that plant. Larry digs out an Altoids tin. Rattles it.
LARRY CROWNE => This it?
MERCEDES TAINOT => Why I think it is!
LARRY CROWNE => I'll get the door for you Larry opens the door, reaches in, turns on the light.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Take one step inside and I call security. Larry steps away from the door.
MERCEDES TAINOT => And forget this ever happened.
LARRY CROWNE => What?
MERCEDES TAINOT => This whole sorry chapter tonight.
LARRY CROWNE => What?
MERCEDES TAINOT => You passing up Gidget for a flat old coot like me.
LARRY CROWNE => What are you talking about?
memory? => Larry has been tying to be polite.
LARRY CROWNE => When I say 'what', it means I get it and have already purposefully forgotten everything. Call it irony.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Sarcasm. Irony is when Gallant lands in the drunk tank while Goofus scoots me home.
LARRY CROWNE => Goodnight, Ms. Tainot. She doesn't move, but flashes her ring finger.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Mrs. I'm Mrs. Tainot. Can you not see that?
LARRY CROWNE => I assumed you preferred Ms
MERCEDES TAINOT => When we presume we make a pretty pair of asses of me and you or something like that.
LARRY CROWNE => That's a long story and it's late.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Help yourself. She sticks her neck out. If this were a movie, they might kiss right now. Larry pauses. Mercedes looks at him. He's not a bad looking guy. He starts to undo the helmet strap.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I noticed something on the ride.
IT MAY => You smell good.
LARRY CROWNE => Thanks. He gently removes the strap and helmet from her head. be a bit sexy. Her hair tumbles out.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Do you have a crush on me? Single student. Unattainable teacher. It's common. Larry has no idea what to say.
LARRY CROWNE => We all have crushes on you. Even the gals.
MERCEDES TAINOT => You want to make out with me, you can. I know I'm not a third rate Audrey Hepburn wanna-be but I still
GOT MOVES => Come on, Gramps. Take this ride.
MERCEDES TAINOT => My spouse won't be home for 3 to 5 years. Larry ponders this moment for as long as he can. He shouldn't, of course. But, damn. She is Mercedes Tainot. Bang.
everything. => Larry pulls back. After a bit, though. She could have kept at it, too.
LARRY CROWNE => Wow...
MERCEDES TAINOT => Pretty dang good. I still got it, no?
LARRY CROWNE => Yes, you do..
LARRY CROWNE => Goodnight, whoever you are!
MERCEDES TAINOT => Whoever I am...
DEAN TAINOT => Oh, Jesus Hell and tomorrow...
hungover. => As she straightens up, her eye catches...
head. => Still, she keeps and eye on Larry. And pursues...
with Larry. => Then she sees her.
MERCY => Is crushed. For the obvious reasons sh s ill can't understand. She was hoping to have Larry to herself for a minute or two.
LARRY CROWNE => Epilog. School today.
TALIA => Lance! A Betty on your Scooter after midnight? Holding on, her arms around you, pressed against your back, is a license to at least cop a feel.
LARRY CROWNE => If we had ended up making out, you still wouldn't hear it. Talia slugs him. All in play...
PINEDO => Seeing them -- the Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis -- should have been beyond me, but I was a little girl in Coach class still awake, a window seat, a moonless night somewhere over Greenland with a shimmering curtain of emerald, gossamer light dancing just for me.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Mr. Crowne? A moment please?
CALIMERIS => Why doesn't she just throw herself at him?
PINEDO => This is bordering on harassment now.
DIBIASI => Quiet down. I'm watching the TV show...
MACK => Why doesn't this ever happen to me?
MERCEDES TAINOT => I need a few moments alone with Mr. Crowne thank you.
DIBIASI => Move along folks. Privacy's a right in this great nation of ours.
MACK => You want I should close this door, lock it, and barricade it so you won't be disturbed?? We hear them cackling like geese in the hall.
LARRY CROWNE => How are the Triplets? Groggy, Puffy, and Grumpy. He means the hangover.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Last night was a confluence of too many things happening in too short
LARRY CROWNE => Last i ht? Let's see, what was I doing? Studying some. Working some. Can't recall. I've forgotten everything that happened last night as best a gentleman can.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I had no right to judge you or your relationships. Date who you want. Larry has no idea what that means.
MERCEDES TAINOT => But what happened last night -- between adults -- was inappropriate. If gossip were to circulate, the problem could be more than just embarrassing. My status as a professor could be tarnished.
LARRY CROWNE => I wouldn't want that.
MERCEDES TAINOT => happened before.
MERCEDES TAINOT => With parking attendants. Strangers at parties when I've had a bit too much of the demon rum. This was the first time with a student.
LARRY CROWNE => Sure. Nothing happened. At all.
MERCEDES TAINOT => So there will be no bravado among you and your pals?
LARRY CROWNE => None.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Thank you, Mr. Crowne.
him. => Larry leaves - a good mood ruined... Mercy watches him go. What is going on behind those dark glasses?
LAMARR => Puff. Don't suck. Then... relax.
LARRY CROWNE => I have to sell my car. Put a new top on it.
LARRY CROWNE => If I could afford a new top I could afford to keep it.
LAMARR => What's the job paying you?
LARRY CROWNE => Half my UniMart salary.
LAMARR => You're down, Larry Crowne. Down as dirt.
LARRY CROWNE => I'm looking back on the year Denise left as the good old days.
LAMARR => Hang in there, neighbor.
LARRY CROWNE => Everyone keeps saying that.
LARRY CROWNE => The odds of two people on the same street winning the lottery are worse than one person on the street winning the lottery.
LAMARR => I read how the universe is expanding, Larry, taking us along with it. That is a wild concept to grasp, but what it means is, we all have to hold on tight sometimes to get to where we're going to be.
LAMARR => Keep your grip. You'll be okay. It's like the wife always says... Shoppers pull up to Lamarr's Yard Sale. The WIFE has a
LAMARR => A woman with a measuring tape? That's money in my pocket. A ball flies in and hits Larry smack in the head, sending his pipe flying.
REGISTER => Vasquez - Security - is gone, replaced by Cubby -- the former Janitor who is now the skinniest SECURITY GUARD in history. Larry slides the signs for purchase. Manning the thing? Vicky Hurley. Not looking good
HURLEY => ' ind bargains today?'
LARRY CROWNE => Vick? How you doing? Larry Crowne. Hurley looks at him. She looks tired. And stupid in her Cashier's Apron.
HURLEY => Larry. Hi.
LARRY CROWNE => Why are you on the Register?
HURLEY => Management Execs are now required to put in 8-hour shifts on the floor. Every day. No overtime. No bonus. Just more hours. Cash or UniMart Bargain Card? Like you have one of them.
LARRY CROWNE => Cash. No receipt. Hurley is robotic.
HURLEY => You got out of here just in time... 'Thank you for choosing UniMart, where united we blah blah.'
MERCEDES TAINOT => Thanks for coming.
DEAN TAINOT => No notice. No preamble. Just an email and a google map.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I knew you'd be on the computer.
DEAN TAINOT => Point made.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Are we making a mistake here?
MERCEDES TAINOT => Point made. We could change things. We could start right now.
DEAN TAINOT => We could. Why should we?
MERCEDES TAINOT => Because we have history, Dean. But first, my thoughts... I've got to address drinking. I should be able to comprehend and respond to both sides of our conversations. And the morning shower should be refreshing, not a hangover cure.
DEAN TAINOT => I'd like that too.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Really?
DEAN TAINOT => You're not a pleasant woman after a
MERCEDES TAINOT => Okay. Now, you. Dean is caught short.
DEAN TAINOT => I see. I'm what this is all about.
MERCEDES TAINOT => There are plenty of items on the relationship agenda but let's start here.
DEAN TAINOT => You're talking about you but you really mean me.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I'm not saying that.
DEAN TAINOT => We've both been here before. Why prolong the process? White flag! I give up. This ain't working.
DEAN TAINOT => I don't think there is anything else to talk about. Do you?
MERCEDES TAINOT => Here I have surprise topics. Friday, in a Lightning Round, you must wax on that topic for 2 minutes without pause, repetition, or lack of charm. No notes. One visual aid.
MS. PINEDO => 'Potatoes?'
MERCEDES TAINOT => Spuds. Can't wait. Dibiasi draws a paper.
DIBIASI => 'Disraeli'? What is that?
MERCEDES TAINOT => Who is that?
DIBIASI => It's a guy from Disrael. I'm done. Now it's Larry's turn. He shyly draws a paper -- a bit uncomfortable in class since the recent events.
LARRY CROWNE => 'Consumerism'.
LARRY CROWNE => The handwriting is loopy. Looks like 'Consumerism'.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Fine. 2 minutes on Consumerism. Calimeris picks. Hers is loopy, too.
CALIMERIS => 'Malpity Hoople.'
MERCEDES TAINOT => No idea. Just pick another.
DR. MATSUTANI => By now you should be laughing with me. Larry can't believe Talia is not there...
LARRY CROWNE => You missed Matsutani's class. Review for the final.
TALIA => I'm done w th college.
LARRY CROWNE => What? Why?
TALIA => Because I'm going into business.
LARRY CROWNE => Talia. Don't be a fool. Stay in school. Don't throw away your education.
TALIA => And don't drink and drive or do drugs and quit smoking and eat vegetables. I don't. I stopped. I did. I do.
TALIA => Pretty much. Oh, look. Maurice gave us free tattoos. I wanted something in Japanese so check this out. She shows it to him, just above her butt-crack. It's two Japanese characters.
TALIA => That one says 'courage'. That one says 'spirit'. Courageous Spirit. Dell Gordo knocks on the window as Larry has his hands on his gal's butt... "What's this, Lance??"
LARRY CROWNE => Japanese characters go the other way and that says Soy Sauce.
TALIA => Oh shut up.
TALIA => Be here for our Grand Opening!
LARRY CROWNE => Might not make it. I have finals!
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => This place anonymous enough?
MERCEDES TAINOT => As long as alcohol's out of my grasp.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => They have good pie, they say.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Great. Sugar can replace tequila in my bloodstream, my thighs, and the folds in my neck. They pass a car prominently parked - Larry's Convertible Karmann Ghia with a sign on its windshield: "FOR SALE BY
MERCEDES TAINOT => Yep.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => You'd think leggy blondes like us would be impervious, right? At that moment, Larry Crowne happens to come out of the kitchen to help himself to a cup of coffee. Mercedes sees him just as Perry comes up with menus.
PERRY => Ladies. Bring an appetite?
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => The mark of a restaurant is their Key Lime pie. Mercedes is surprised to see Larry in a chef's hat.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => No Key Lime?
PERRY => Cream pies I got.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => Boston Cream?
PERRY => Boston Cream? Key Lime? Lady, you're killing me here.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => Phooey. Peach. Peach pie.
PERRY => Ma'am?
MERCEDES TAINOT => I'll have the French Toast.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => French Toast?
MERCEDES TAINOT => You won't believe how far I fell on the Hooch-o-meter.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => I have seen it happen a time or two.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I kissed a boy.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => When, third grade?
MERCEDES TAINOT => One of my students.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => You Hoor.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Older than me.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => Hugh Hefner in your class? What went down?
MERCEDES TAINOT => He sort of... rescued me. And... he smelled nice.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => He a fireman who bakes bread?
MERCEDES TAINOT => I wanted to be kissed so asked if he wanted to and he did.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => Bold. Who is he?
LARRY CROWNE => She's insane.
PERRY => Take it up with her. Larry heads out of the kitchen.
PERRY => No shouting, okay? This is a family friendly establishment.
LARRY CROWNE => Frances Taylor-Briegh. You have a problem with your order?
LARRY CROWNE => Mrs. Tainot.
MERCEDES TAINOT => This is Larry Crowne.
LARRY CROWNE => There's no way in creation I screw up French Toast.
MERCEDES TAINOT => It was fine, actually.
LARRY CROWNE => You'll be the judge of that. The is a beat of silence.
LARRY CROWNE => So, your meal is satisfactory?
MERCEDES TAINOT => Absolutely.
LARRY CROWNE => Would you let my boss know so I don't lose this job?
MERCEDES TAINOT => Yes indeed.
LARRY CROWNE => Shall I prepare you another batch?
MERCEDES TAINOT => No. Thanks.
LARRY CROWNE => Then I will return to my station.. Mercedes watches him go.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => You kissed the cook...
MERCEDES TAINOT => Look at the men in my life.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH => Blame it on the booze... and collect yourself.
MERCEDES TAINOT => That's my problem. I'm a drunken hoor.
and teas. => MUSIC is playing as these girlfriends reconstruct Mercy's life...
MERCEDES TAINOT => What a difference from day one. I must be a better teacher than I thought.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I was tough on him. But he learned fast. How he connected the Circle of Sales to the expanding universe is impressive as hell. I'll never forget about the Value Index now. He gave a perfect speech.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I'm so sorry. Please go on.
DIBIASI => Larry? It okay if I get to my climax and denouement? Larry nods.
DIBIASI => Thank you... If it was the romance novelist in him that made Victoria the Queen become such a pal, chalk it up as another brick in the legacy of Ben Disraeli -- Earl of Beaconsfield - Educator - and Prime Minister of Great Britain. Not bad for a Jewish guy, huh? Dibiasi is done. Applause.
PINEDO => Not so much as a bump, Nomad! Why'd you go last?
DIBIASI => Fourth quarter dramatics.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Congratulations all of you.
MACK => Who's the MVP, Mrs. Tainot? Can we vote?
MERCEDES TAINOT => Not me, I have to stay objective.
MACK => I say... Lala! They all say Lala! It's unanimous! They start chanting her name. "La la! La la! La la!" -- embarrassing her. Larry sits her down in her chair and gets the other guys to pick her up like she's the bride at a wedding.
DR. MATSUTANI => The first to finish. No surprise. Dr. Matsutani hands Larry his confiscated phone. Larry leaves.
part himself. => He sits for a moment -- in the breakfast nook -- surveying his kitchen, what was once his. Mack comes in with a box of his LP's.
MACK => This is the last of them. Damn, you have a lot of records.
LARRY CROWNE => Priceless at a buck apiece.
LAMARR => Selling this futon-sofabed? All those years across the street and you've learned nothing.
LARRY CROWNE => You'll get me top price.
LAMARR => You did learn.
DIBIASI => Pizza at last!
LARRY CROWNE => Here's lunch as promised! The BIG STORK PIZZA GUY pulls up in a different car but the same sign.
STRANG => Son of a cock. Larry Crowne. The Pizza guy is none other than Jack Strang.
LARRY CROWNE => Jack Strang. Wow. This is irony.
STRANG => Two extra large. One Salad Bucket. Box of Frosty Cinnamon Eggs. Sixteen- fifty. Larry hands him the coupon and a Twenty.
LARRY CROWNE => Jack. I need two bucks back. Times are tough.
STRANG => Tell me about it.
LARRY CROWNE => Ah. Forget it. Keep the change.
RAUL => My next wife just walked in. Perry looks.
PERRY => I love this business sometimes.
PERRY => Larry, your Speech 217 teacher has a question about the menu. Larry can see her. She looks gorgeous.
RAUL => Go ahead. I'll take the window even though I'm the boss of the whole kitchen.
MERCEDES TAINOT => There's Larry Crowne. Are you allowed to sit?
LARRY CROWNE => I add chicory and a bit of vanilla. Trick I picked up in the Navy.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Actually, everybody got an A, but you got the special A where I tell you in person.
LARRY CROWNE => Didn't expect that. Thanks, Mrs. Tainot.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Class is out. Call me Mercedes. Or Mercy, for short.
MERCEDES TAINOT => No. I meant the... never mind.
LARRY CROWNE => This has turned into a full time gig. Out of necessity.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I hope you continue your education. Back at East City. You've made such a good start.
LARRY CROWNE => I'll have to see.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I got Speech 217 moved to 10 AM, thank God. Who knows what I'll hear with the extra sleep.
teacher. => They look at each other.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Should get going.
LARRY CROWNE => Cars not much. Devices some. They rise.
GPS VOICE => Please enter your destination.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Oh be quiet. That's a MapGenie.
MERCEDES TAINOT => It is Hellspawn.
LARRY CROWNE => In my old job, I'd have steered you to a Vortex unit. The MapGenie interface is clumsy and the menu needs too many inputs. He is reaching into the car, across her to tap the unit.
MERCEDES TAINOT => It was working fine. Then I think I pressed too many buttons.
LARRY CROWNE => Ah. The Auto On Feature is engaged. Menu. Select. Features. Auto Voice. Select. Change? Yes. On. Off. Done? Yes. Save. Back. Back. Back. Exit. While he was doing that, Mercedes was smelling what she could of Larry. She liked it. She looked at his neck, his ears. And smelled him.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Seemed like years and years.
LARRY CROWNE => All better now. Should be able to find your way. Nothing to do now but say goodbye.
LARRY CROWNE => My Boss. Back to work.
PERRY => Kimosabe, holding off til after school to woo the teacher is the move of a class act. Larry turns to watch Mercedes drive away.
Financial Aid!" => Did you notice? The cost of an education just went up...
head count. => Only 6 students are enrolled. She's going to lose this one, again. Clumps up the wooden steps are heard...
DIBIASI =>  I gotta get off, Baby, or I'm in hot water with Professor Tai-bo... Mercy does a Shakespearean dance of joy.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Is Larry with you?
CALIMERIS => Um, no. Should we track him down and drag him in here? Mercedes does her best to hide her disappointment.
MERCEDES TAINOT => I... Seeing you all... I just thought...
PINEDO => Carrying a torch for Larry til it burns her hands...
BUSIK => All the excitement of first day of term, I don't want to go back to my empty apartment. Do you? I need a drink and some talk and some wind- down time. Don't you?
DR. MATSUTANI => Ms. Tainot? She turns.
DR. MATSUTANI => Larry Crowne is taking six units from me, devouring the material like a starving man.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Larry's enrolled?
DR. MATSUTANI => He's continuing his education and tells me it is because of you. That your class changed his life. Mercedes finds herself smiling -- beaming...
MERCEDES TAINOT => Larry said that about me?
BUSIK => Oh yeah! I put that guy in your class. So technically, I changed his life.
MERCEDES TAINOT => He is a good student
DR. MATSUTANI => And handy on a scooter.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Well, no. No offense Dr. M.
DR. MATSUTANI => The rumor is you are newly single and I was just taking a shot. Mercy looks right at Busik.
MERCEDES TAINOT => News travels fast. Busik pretends he knows nothing...
BUSIK => If you're going out, I'm not doing
DR. MATSUTANI => Have you ever been to Hooters?
BUSIK => For the spicy wings, yes!

GPS VOICE => Right Turn.

MERCEDES TAINOT => I'm Mercy Tainot
TALIA => Bambi Romp in the Glen. Looking for Lance?
MERCEDES TAINOT => 4225 Harbor?
TALIA => This is 4227.
TALIA => Little higher heels'll get you wolf whistles.
MERCEDES TAINOT => Did you tell Ed Matsutani taking my class changed your life?
MERCEDES TAINOT => How?
LARRY CROWNE => I met you. That's it.
served. => The most beautiful woman ever to wear a bathrobe has made French Toast and is settling into the Breakfast Nook. Larry Crowne has his hair all on one side of his head -- post- Afternoon-Of-Amok-Loving. His arm shows a Navy tattoo that may be old or new... Mercy Tainot glows in and out. She slides next to him, close to him The meal is perfect
