MR. STILLINGS => A little more to the right, Sinclair.
SINCLAIR => (Moving the final "S"
IN "HAPPINESS") => That better, Mr. Stillings? Title on marquee fades out and "Produced by..." credit fades in.
SINCLAIR =>  Have you met her yet?
MR. STILLINGS => Not yet. But don't worry, Sinclair, I'll introduce you!
SINCLAIR => You promise?
HONEY => Ah, what a town! HONEY is dressed for the premiere in an elegant evening gown and her black hair is cut perfectly in the Louise Brooks style that has become her signature. She continues her press conference under the watchful eyes of her press agent CHARLES and her long-time assistant LIBBY, both of whom are also dressed for the premiere. ROOM SERVICE employees stand by, ready to serve.
HONEY => I tell everybody in Hollywood, when you shoot on location in Baltimore, you don't need to bring all the crew from Los Angeles. Baltimore really ia the best!...
MR. STILLINGS => and remember, Miss Whitlock is every inch a movie star and expects to be on stage at exactly 7:10pm to ensure live coverage from all three local news shows. By the way, I hear she's really a nice person...
HONEY => Look at this dump of a town! HONEY turns to her long suffering assistant, LIBBY. The press is gone and they are alone.
HONEY => Get me the fuck back to L.A. If one more asshole mentions a crab cake to me, I think I'll puke.
LIBBY =>  Did you try the steamed crabs? They're red and...
HONEY => No I didn't! I'm not interested in any kind of meal you have to beat with a mallet... A knock is heard at hotel door.
CHARLES => Your limousine is here, Miss Whitlock. You look beautiful.
HONEY =>  Thank you Charles, darling. We'll be right with you. I'm excited. CHARLES exits.
HONEY =>  Do you think Pat Nixon got fucked in this hotel room?
HONEY => It's called the "Presidential Suite" isn't it?
LIBBY => Yes...but...
HONEY => I BET SHE DID! Call the manager and ask him!
HONEY => It's your  to ask, Libby! Call downstairs and find out if Pat Nixon got fucked in my hotel room! I want to know!
LIBBY =>  The hotel manager said "No." Pat Nixon never stayed here, but Nancy Reagen did in 1986...
LIBBY => Well. . .sort of. I mean you told me...
HONEY => I was kidding Libby. He must think you're a complete lunatic! Good God, you'd do anything! A HOTEL MAID pushing a cart of towels and bathroom supplies comes around a corner and is completely star-struck.
MAID => Good luck, Miss Whitlock! HONEY's face freezes in horror as elevator doors open and she is led inside.
HONEY =>  Did you hear what that little bitch said to me?
LIBBY => She didn't know.
HONEY => In show business we say "break a leg." NEVER fucking "Good Luck"!
HONEY => That cocksucker put a curse on my whole fucking premiere! HOTEL GUESTS let out a cry of shock at HONEY's language.
HONEY => Mayor Fenwick! LIBBY and CHARLES look to one another relieved as HOTEL GUESTS stumble out of elevator, shaking their heads in disgust.
MAYOR => Miss Whitlock, what an honor! They pose together as PRESS snaps away.
HONEY => I love what you've done with this city.
MAYOR => And Baltimore loves you back!  I, Adam Fenwick, Mayor of the City of Baltimore, do hereby proclaim April 29th to be Honey Whitlock Day in Maryland and do command this observation to all of our citizens. Whereas...
PETIE =>  6:41pm.
SINCLAIR =>  10-4, Petie. SINCLAIR nods gravely to LYLE the projectionist who picks up a 35mm metal film can and sneaks up behind MR. STILLINGS who is looking down from projection booth to the premiere CROWD filling the theater below.
MR. STILLINGS => Christ, there's what's-her-name from E Network. Look at the tits on her! LYLE hits MR. STILLINGS over the head with the film can.
SINCLAIR => (In full command, over walkie,
CHECKING WATCH) => 6:43pm. Hit it, "SPROCKET HOLES."
LEWIS => (Into walkie, as he searches
UNDER SEAT) => 6:48pm. An usher's job is never done, put down the flashlight and pick up the gun! LEWIS finds hidden gun and sneakily puts it in his pocket.
CHARDONNAY =>  Ticket, please... 18. Cut back to EXTERIOR HARBOR COURT HOTEL. 18. Closeup of HONEY WHITLOCK's furious face as she stares in horror at awaiting white stretch limousine driven by
CHARLES => What's the matter, Miss Whitlock?
HONEY => A fucking white limousine?!
LIBBY => Oh nobody will know, we're in Baltimore...
HONEY => I'm not Liberace's boyfriend, for Chrissakes...My contract says black limousines only!
LIBBY => The charity probably made the arrangements. It was an innocent mistake.
MAYOR =>  Break a leg, Miss Whitlock! RODNEY, in a panic, keeps checking his watch.
RODNEY => Excuse me, ma'am, but Security's gonna have my ass if we're late...
HONEY => (Turning on him with a
VENGEANCE) => Don't say "ass" to me, trailer trash! I'll have you fired!
TICKET BUYER =>  The Heart Fund must be thrilled at the turnout.
DINAH => It's for a wonderful cause... Thanks for your support. (Between customers, sneakily
INTO WALKIE) => 7:01pm. Inch by mother fucking inch...
HONEY =>  "Some Kind Of Happiness" is a
SINCLAIR =>  7:06pm...The Big Snatch. HONEY steps from limo and waves like a true star to roar of approval from crowd as PRESS blinds her with flashbulbs.
SINCLAIR =>  Good evening, Miss Whitlock, and welcome to the historic Senator Theater.
MRS. MALLORY =>  Good evening, I'm Sylvia Mallory, Chairman of the Maryland Heart Fund and this is Little William... LITTLE WILLIAM glares sullenly at audience, unhappy to be there.
MRS. MALLORY => Little William had heart surgery just seven days ago and thanks to the blood transfusion paid for by your generosity at tonight's premiere, he's going to be alright, aren't you, Little William?
MRS. MALLORY =>  Little William's a little grumpy...
LITTLE WILLIAM =>  Get off me, ugly.
MRS. MALLORY => And now the moment you've been waiting for! You first saw Honey Whitlock on the screen as the lovely ingenue turned vixen in "Good For Nothing"...
MRS. MALLORY => .and from then on it's been hit after hit... LITTLE WILLIAM kicks MRS. MALLORY in leg behind the podium where AUDIENCE can't see.
MRS. MALLORY =>  .after hit. LITTLE WILLIAM smiles at her sadistically. MRS. MALLORY tries to inch away from LITTLE WILLIAM who sneakily continues to kick her.
MRS. MALLORY => ."Ask The Lonely"..."The Big Hurt"... LITTLE WILLIAM kicks her harder.
MRS. MALLORY => (Off mike, furiously to
LITTLE WILLIAM) => Watch it, you little fucker!  .her Oscar winning performance in "Forced Entry" and tonight... "Some Kind Of Happiness."
OF THEATER. => HONEY waits for her cue to go on with SINCLAIR and her "bodyguard" RODNEY.
MRS. MALLORY => .Ladies and gentlemen, a big Baltimore welcome for MISS
disbelief. => LITTLE WILLIAM sneers at HONEY's approach with hostility.
flying. => AUDIENCE hits the floor screaming in panic. RODNEY pulls a gun and fires into air as HONEY screams in horror. CHERISH throws a molotov cocktail and it explodes in front of theater between stage and first row of seats, blocking any rescue of HONEY by NEWSTEAMS.
the mayhem. => CECIL drags a screaming HONEY off stage as RODNEY runs interference, firing wildly over screaming AUDIENCE's heads.
PAM => 
HONEY => 
towards premiere. => In rear view mirror, PETIE sees three other COP CARS speeding up to Senator Theater and screeching to a stop.
CECIL => I fuckin' hate car chase scenes!
PETIE => (Flooring the accelerator,
PISSED) => Yeah, but "Bullit" was good! LYLE snorts cocaine off a coke-spoon and nonchalantly picks glass out of his hair.
LYLE => But it lead to the "French Connection."
LEWIS => And lead to "Smokey and The Bandit" and that kinda shit! PETIE sees another cop car speeding up behind him in the rear view mirror. DINAH leans out limo window and fires gun back'at cop car.
PETIE =>  Yeah, Part fucking Two, 1980!...
CHERISH =>  Long live pornography!
church. => Cop car swerves right to avoid collision and careens into CABLE TV installation truck. COP jumps out of car and starts firing at limo.
RAVEN =>  Your mother sucks cocks in hell! HEAVY METAL KIDS look at each other in horror and run
SUBURBAN LADY => Sinclair, is that you? PETIE turns down radio and GANG freezes.
CECIL =>  Hi, Mrs. Waltrup.
SUBURBAN LADY => Did you win the lottery?
SUBURBAN LADY => I don't go to the movies much, I wait for the video.
CECIL => Not me, I like the big screen.
SUBURBAN LADY => Say hello to your mom and dad for me.
CECIL => I sure will. SUBURBAN LADY makes right on red and pulls off.
CECIL =>  Casting has been completed! PETIE peels out in other direction. 53. Cut to EXTERIOR "SPROCKET HOUSE," a run-down, 53. seemingly abandoned warehouse in an industrial part of t:he city. The moon is full and the quiet is interrupted by faint sirens in the distance. Suddenly, like a low-rent Bat Cave, the large industrial garage doors swing open and the white limo speeds inside. 54. Dissolve to INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. HONEY's 54. "dressing room"; a bizarrely decorated prison cell fit for a movie queen. HONEY is blindfolded, gagged and tied to a director's chair with her name printed on the back, still wearing her torn and soiled premiere gown. LEWIS, now dressed in terrorist punk outfit removes HONEY's blindfold and gag as she sputters in terror. We see LEWIS has D-A-V-I-D L-Y-N-C-H tattooed on his fingers. HONEY's e yes light up in terror as she sees CECIL, now attired in insane grunge Cecil B. DeMille inspired outfit being lowered by PETIE on jerry-rigged film crane. "Otto Preminger" is tattooed on CECIL's bicep.
CECIL => .Hello, I'm Cecil B. DeMented and I'm your new director... HONEY stares in confused horror.
CECIL => I'd like you to meet your co-stars ...I call them the "Sprocket Holes." HONEY looks over in fear as the SPROCKET HOLES, now changed from their theater uniforms into their own scary "terrorist chic" fashions, gather around CECIL in a "crew-shot from hell" pose.
CECIL => This is Cherish... CHERISH, now heavily made-up and dressed "riot-girl" style, in a "SINEMA" T-shirt, steps forward. We see "Andy Warhol" tattooed on her thigh.
CHERISH => Hi, I played you in lots of porno movies. "Some Kind Of Happiness"? I've already shot it - only it's called "Some Kind Of Horniness."
CECIL => Lyle? LYLE takes a big huff of glue in plastic bag and steps forward. He is dressed in scarily in 1970's junky wear meets 90's Hollywood sleaze, and sports a "Herschell Gordon Lewis" tattoo across his skinny chest.
LYLE => Hi, I'm Lyle and I'm your leading man. I've had a boner for you for years. HONEY pales.
CECIL =>  Don't worry, we've all taken a vow of celibacy for celluloid. No one gets laid until we've finished our movie. We're horny... CHERISH starts writhing sexily.
CECIL => .but our film comes first. CECIL gently shoves her away as SPROCKET HOLES undulate in sexual frustration.
CECIL => .And now for the crew. PAM the popcorn girl swaggers over carrying a beat-up vintage 16mm movie camera and aims it at HONEY's face. She is wearing a black para-military jump suit and we
PAM => I'm Pam, the director of photography and you'd better hit your mark! CHARDONNAY, now done up in outrageous homegirl gangster look, carries an old wrecked Nagra sound recorder and spins her microphone boom pole like lethal numchucks before raising it over HONEY's head, revealing the "Spike Lee" tattoo on her stomach.
CHARDONNAY => .and remember - SPEAK UP, BITCH! I'm Chardonnay and I do the sound. LEWIS proudly steps forward, menacingly holding staple gun like a weapon.
LEWIS => We met. I'm Lewis, the art director. I hope you'll be comfortable here... HONEY looks around cell and sees giant stills blown up from her past films showing her in physical and emotional distress.
RAVEN => Hi, I'm Raven and I'm a Satanist. I'll be doing your makeup... HONEY stares back in confusion.
RAVEN => You look so pale... RAVEN suddenly slaps HONEY across face and HONEY cries out in shock.
RAVEN => Sorry... but Satan says... you need color! RODNEY, the biker "bodyguard," now in S&M leather get-up steps toward HONEY carrying a rat-tail comb and a hair dye applicator bottle. His "Almodovar" tattoo is a beauty.
RODNEY => Call me Rodney. Tomorrow I'm bleaching your hair out platinum and I should warn you...I FUCKING HATE ROOTS! PETIE, the sexy hillbilly "chauffeur," now dressed in redneck militant garb and featuring a "Fassbinder" tattoo, steps forward.
PETIE => Hey, I'm Petie, remember me, "the trailer trash"? I'll be your driver. I'll take you anywhere... anywhere but home!! (Laughs evilly as he
CARESSES RODNEY) => From behind a curtain, covering a room of lab and editing equipment comes DINAH, now dressed in alarming vintage fashion outfit that shows off her shapely but purposely hairy legs. "Sam Fuller" is tattooed on her back. She wheels a TV set and VCR mounted on wheels framed by little velvet curtain.
DINAH =>  I'm Dinah, Cecil's prodcer and I do everything! I've been knocking down box office money from every big Hollywood hit for years to pay for this
NEWSMAN => . So once again, our top story. Sylvia Mallory, the fifty-two year old chairwoman of the Maryland Heart Fund died tonight at Union Memorial Hospital following an on stage heart attack she suffered in the middle of Honey Whitlock's kidnapping at tonight's Baltimore movie premiere... SPROCKET HOLES stare in amazement at TV screen, the enormity of their act barely sinking in.
NEWSMAN => .the teenage gang of cinema terrorists who apparently infiltrated the staff of the Senator Theater are now eligible for the death penalty in the State of Maryland... CECIL nods to DINAH to turn it off, which she does. SPROCKET HOLES gulp and look to their leader for guidance. CECIL steps forward, getting right in HONEY's terrified face.
CECIL => Miss Whitlock, we're going to make our first film and NOBODY'S going to stop us. Lots of kids dream of making a movie... SPROCKET HOLES smile in brain-washed enthusiasm.
CECIL => .but only the ones willing to dia for it succeed. HONEY looks into CECIL's face and lets out a sob of terror.
FADE OUT. => 55. Fade in to EXTERIOR "SPROCKET HOUSE." Next morning. 55. We hear HONEY letting out a fresh cry of agony.
RODNEY => You're going right off the deep end of the Clairol color chart! RODNEY squirts on more dye.
HONEY => It's burning my scalp! Ow! Ow! Ow!
RODNEY => Beauty comes from agony! Everyone knows that!
RAVEN => I haven't had this much fun since my last livestock mutilation... RAVEN lunges towards HONEY's eyebrows and painfully tweezes out a hair.
HONEY => Oh God! That really hurt!
RAVEN => "In the House of Pain, there
RODNEY => Let's wash it out! RODNEY yanks HONEY's head back as RAVEN pours scalding water over her head.
HONEY => (Screams in pain,
SPUTTERING) => Oh God, please!
HONEY =>  .I mean... not little. . .10w budget. . .you know, cult.
CECIL => Good morning, Miss Whitlock. Know your lines?
HONEY => Please...Mr. DeMento? Is that correct?
HONEY => You have the wrong star for this film...
CECIL => Nonsense, Miss Whitlock...
DINAH => (Ignoring passing police
SIREN OUTSIDE) => Even your agent can't help you now!
CECIL => Ah Fidget. Fidget, my little genius, :Fidget!
FIDGET => (Not missing a beat,
TO HONEY) => Please take off your clothes. 58. INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. Equipment area, next to 58. "Wardrobe." PAM is changing the film in her changing bag between her legs. She hears FIDGET and looks up excitedly. CHARDONNAY takes off her earphones and nods to LEWIS who is finishing up painting a van to look like a FEDEX delivery truck. All quickly exit.
CECIL => (To HONEY, ever the
LEADER) => Don't worry, they're not allowed any form of sexual release.:. HONEY nervously starts to unzip her gown. SPROCKET HOLES let out an involuntary sexual moan.
HONEY =>  The Screen Actors Guild will hear about this and I mean it! HONEY lets gown fall to floor and steps out of it. She is wearing beautiful lingerie.
FIDGET =>  Excuse me, ma'am. 
32 - => RODNEY moans in sexual frustration as HONEY begins getting dressed in FIDGET's costume. DINAH pants from above as HONEY slips on tight pants. LEWIS, CHARDONNAY, and PAM watch from peepholes, breathing hard and moaning as HONEY slips into jacket. PETIE appears and jealously catches RODNEY trying to peek down the front of HONEY's jacket. RODNEY looks away guiltily. FIDGET whacks and "creates," lewdly "styling" HONEY's outfit. He then wheels full-length mirror to HONEY and signals to CECIL she is ready. HONEY sees her transformation into terrorist glamour girl for the first time.
HONEY => Oh, God, I look terrible!  CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES applaud triumphantly.
DINAH =>  Alright, LET'S LOCK IT UP!
CECIL => Can't you say good morning to Lewis? He worked hard on this set with a budget of zero.
HONEY => Good... morning.
CECIL => Our picture is called "Raving Beauty." You play the insane owner of a failed art theater who along with her film fanatic boyfriend Lyle. . .Lyle come on over... LYLE enters dressed in hepcat 70's junkie splendor wear.
CECIL => .and her violence prone daughter, Cherish... CHERISH enters in eye-popping "super model goes bad" look as HONEY's eyes light up in horror.
HONEY => "Daughter"?!
CECIL => .Together, the three of you vow to start a revolution to destroy mainstream cinema...
CECIL => You dare to tell Cecil B. DeMented you refuse!
HONEY => I'm too young to play her mother!
HONEY =>  It doesn't feel right... I'm just not motivated...
CECIL => (Advancing on her with
STUN GUN) => How's this for motivation? Huh? CECIL zaps her painfully with the stun gun. HONEY twitches in agony and lets out a painful scream.
CECIL => There are no creative differences on a Cecil B. DeMented set, Miss Whitlock. Got that? One day you'll thank me for saving you from your bad career. 
CECIL => .and ACTION! CECIL moves around stage, making cliche director's frame with his hands as PAM and CHARDONNAY rehearse camera and sound moves behind him. All the camera equipment has "UNIV OF MD" stenciled on it that has been scratched out half-heartedly.
LYLE =>  Hey, Cherish, it's 8:00. Am I supposed to get this show on the screen or what!?
CHERISH =>  I didn't sell one ticket, Lyle. Nobody came!
HONEY =>  It's that fucking new multiplex that opened in the mall, isn't it? CECIL's face turns to stone as the rest of the SPROCKET HOLES watch, shocked at HONEY's wooden performance.
CHERISH => I heard they were sold out last night, Mom!
HONEY =>  Somebody's gotta pay for this insult! HONEY looks out and sees SPROCKET HOLES aping CECIL's self-destructive review of her reading; DINAH slaps her own face, LEWIS staples his own leg; RODNEY jams the sharp end of a rat-tail comb in his ear. This title will be replaced by a more recent critically panned big film hit we can get the rights to.
HONEY =>  Death to those who support mainstream cinema!
CECIL => 
PLACES! => LYLE, CHERISH and HONEY return to start position as the rest of SPROCKET HOLES get ready to film.
PICTURE'S UP! => 
PAM => Camera rolling.
CHARDONNAY => (Spinning sound boom
INTO POSITION) => Speed.
PAM => Mark it! DINAH marks the take.
LYLE =>  Hey, Cherish, it's 8:00. Am I supposed to get this show on the screen or what?
LYLE => Pasolini's playing and we have an empty theater? HONEY enters and does the lines convincingly.
CHERISH => I heard they were sold out last night, Mom.
LYLE => Not for "THE FLINTSTONES"?!
HONEY =>  Somebody's gotta pay for this insult! CECIL silently mouths the dialogue along with HONEY.
HONEY => From the empty movie seats of every good movie theater in America, we will rise to take back the screen!
HONEY => Death to those who support mainstream cinema!
CECIL => That's more like it, Miss Whitlock! CHERISH gives HONEY a suddenly jealous look.
HONEY =>  To be frank, Cecil, I would never do this picture in my real film life. The whole message is stupid - ask theater owners in any country and they'll tell you. Hollywood makes the best films in the world and I'm proud to be part of that system.
CECIL =>  Let's move on!
CECIL => The first take is the only real truth...
HONEY => But you can't cut the film with only a master!
CECIL => There are no rules in outlaw cinema, Miss Whitlock, only edges. We believe technique to be nothing more than failed style. You see, I've had a vision... All the SPROCKET HOLES smile like film zombies to
CECIL => .and that vision is called "ultimate reality." The rest of our film is shot in real life, with real people ... . and yes, with real terror. 63. Flip wipe to EXTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. Industrial 63. doors swing open and freshly painted phony FEDEX truck comes speeding out.
HONEY => Please, no! Let's go back! I hate location work! 64. INTERIOR FEDEX VAN as it drives through downtown 64. streets and enters Jones Falls Expressway. PETIE is behind the wheel as LYLE and CHERISH study their lines in hand-written "Raving Beauty" script. CECIL hurriedly flips through TIME Magazine until he finds the article he wants. RODNEY and RAVEN torture HONEY with their constant touchups as PAM, CHARDONNAY, DINAH and FIDGET crowd in the back of van with equipment and guns as LEWIS reads a copy of "Psychotronic" magazine.
RODNEY => I see a fucking root already! He lunges to HONEY's scalp with hair dye applicator bottle.
HONEY => Owwww! Please, Cecil. I'm a much better actress in the studio...
CECIL => That's not what TIME Magazine has to say.
LEWIS => Your picture's gonna lose thirty million dollars.
HONEY =>  Cecil, give yourself up! It's not too late...
LEWIS => Our film goes into profit the day we sell the first ticket!
PETIE =>  How big is his dick, anyway?
HONEY =>  Come to Hollywood with me and I promise I'll get you a job as a production assistant on a real Hollywood movie.
CECIL => .and remember there are no bad takes in a Cecil B. DeMented picture - just keep the scene going
LYLE =>  I never took this much acid
CHERISH => (Primping with FIDGET'S help,
TO HONEY) => Do my tits look OK? They're bigger than yours, you know.
HONEY => Cecil, please don't make me do this scene...
CECIL => Your Hollywood system stole our sex and co-opted our violence so there's nothing left for our kind of movies... except this!
DINAH => Roll camera.
PAM => Camera rolling.
CHARDONNAY => Speed. DINAH marks the take.
THE SCREEN! => HONEY leaps out with gun drawn.
HONEY => 
CECIL => (Aiming his gun at HONEY,
FURIOUS) => Say the lines the way they're written! HONEY, terrified, immediately jumps back into character.
HONEY =>  How dare you play this rotten movie?! PAM pans the camera to BOX OFFICE LADY whose eyes light up in fear at seeing the "actors" in their terrorist outfits.
CECIL => (Yelling to "actors" into
HONEY =>  $7.50 for this piece of shit?! BOX OFFICE LADY screams and locks herself inside as HONEY spray-paints S-H-I-T across box office glass.
LYLE => 
LYLE => (To HONEY, breaking out
OF CHARACTER) => WOW! I'm peaking! RODNEY, RAVEN and FIDGET run to HONEY and touch her up and adjust costume whenever she's off camera.
CECIL => I am Cecil B. DeMented and you're in my movie! Look in the camera and ruin a take and you're both dead! CANDY COUNTER GIRLS get nervy, eager to be in any movie.
HONEY => 
CANDY BAR?! => CANDY COUNTER GIRLS scream in real fear. DINAH and LEWIS enter on exit side of front doors and guard the "set." LYLE and CHERISH enter in character with their guns drawn. LYLE grabs an over-sized cup from behind counter.
LYLE => You call THAT a SMALL??!!
CHERISH => 
MANAGER => (Walking right into
CECIL'S TAKE) => Hey, what's the trouble here!? CHERISH glares at a large marketing booth filled with items for sale in lobby.
MANAGER =>  Please ...I didn't make this movie ... . I'm just the manager... CHARDONNAY knocks him out cold with one smack of her boom pole.
CECIL =>  Say the lines!
HONEY => (To AUDIENCE, ferociously
IN CHARACTER) => You don't have to like this movie!
CHERISH => 
LYLE => 
move. => CECIL smiles in directorial lunacy as one TICKET BUYER vomits right in front of PAM's camera.
CUT! PRINT! => 
FADE OUT. => 72. Fade in to EXTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. NIGHT. 72. We hear a cool rap song on soundtrack called "NO BUDGET." ("When we say action, we mean action,
CHERISH => Come on, Cecil, I want a little "action" of my own!
CECIL =>  I'm trying to write, Cherish! HONEY, looking more relaxed, with only one leg cuffed to director's chair, watches herself on film in the arty, grainy, but very striking footage. RAVEN does a "devil dance" with herself and ritualistically drinks from a skull head.
FIDGET => Miss Whitlock?
HONEY => Oh, craft service. Thank you, Fidget, but I never drink when I'm working but you're very kind. Do your parents know where you are tonight?
FIDGET => They're probably mad...
HONEY => Don't you think you ought to call them...?
HONEY => You know that's nonsense! Go ahead, call them up. I bet they miss you... LYLE ruins everything by staggering over, scarily high.
LYLE => Hey Honey, want some crack?
HONEY => I most certainly do NOT, Lyle. I can't believe you'd be a drug addict in the 90's - it's so retro.
LYLE => Before I was a drug addict, I had so many different problems, Honey. Now I just have one - drugs. It gave my life a real focus. Cut to CECIL on crane with CHERISH as they hornily watch CHERISH on film.
CHERISH =>  How can you see me on film and not want to fuck me?!
CECIL =>  I S-Q want to fuck you, Cherish, but you know I can't...
CHERISH => Why not?!
CECIL =>  I'm not "all your directors," Cherish.
AUTEUR! => LYLE begins projecting the dailies on the writhing bodies of the sexually frustrated SPROCKET HOLES.
CECIL =>  SOLDIERS OF CINEMA, save your sexual energy for the silver screen... SPROCKET HOLES break apart and look up to CECIL.
CECIL => Our footage is stronger than Otto Preminger's... CHERISH licks CECIL's tattoo.
CECIL => .creepier and darker than David Lynch's... LEWIS scratches a sexual note in the music as he lusts towards CHARDONNAY who sings out a torrid moan.
CECIL => .more exploitative than Herschel Gordon Lewis. LYLE humps the projector, out of his mind.
CECIL => .and more violent than Sam Fuller..- DINAH writhes in horniness, pulls her pistol and fires at "The Films of David Lean" coffee table book she uses as a target.
CECIL => We will rise above our raging hormones to a new level of cinema unrest! Cut to FIDGET sneakily dialing parents on phone as HONEY nods her support.
CECIL => . Do whatever it takes to avoid sexual release! Get as drunk as Sam Peckinpah... PAM guzzles whisky.
CECIL => As high as Rainer Werner Fassbinder!... LYLE sniffs fumes from an aerosol can of metallic paint.
CECIL => But stay celibate for celluloid! Cut back to FIDGET on phone. We see his suburban MOM answer on split screen.
FIDGET => I'm fine. The movie's going great, Mom!
CECIL => .Feel the black humor of Almodovar... RODNEY dances a wild S&M step and tries to look PETIE in the eyes.
CECIL => .the satanic fury of Kenneth Anger! RAVEN, possessed by the devil, rolls her eyes back in devil horniness.
CECIL => .the racial tension of Spike Lee... CHARDONNAY lets out a soulful wail as she dances in sexual abandon.
CECIL => (Spotting FIDGET on the phone and giving him the
EVIL EYE) => .and the unashamed exhibitionism of William Castle! FIDGET freezes and looks down at William Castle's name tattooed on his arm.
FIDGET'S MOM =>  Hello? Fidget, talk to me! Hello? We'll come and get you! Tell us where you are! Hello? Hello? FIDGET hangs up phone and starts playing pocket pool frantically. HONEY sighs and shakes her head in disappointment.
LEWIS =>  If we can't have sex, can't we at least make money?
CHARDONNAY =>  Yeah, Lewis thinks I could have a hit record!
financial success! => 
cult worship. => HONEY signals to FIDGET she's changed her mind - she'll have the martini after all.
CECIL => Oh, Andy Warhol, we worship you from the new cinema underground...
ALL => Oh, Andy Warhol, we worship you from the new cinema underground... HONEY guzzles down the martini. CHERISH prays the hardest, still sexually aroused.
CECIL => .help us to use our sexual frustrations as you did for the future of outlaw film!
CECIL => (In a booming voice to all the SPROCKET HOLES
BELOW HIM) => Hey kids! Wake up! Let's make a mother-fucking movie! He hits hideously loud alarm button. SPROCKET HOLES leap to their feet and stagger into film production.
RODNEY =>  I see that fucking brown color...
HONEY => Please Rodney, those aren't roots - they're scabs on my scalp from the dye and they're raw! RODNEY sadistically squirts her roots with dye as HONEY lets out a cry of agony.
HONEY => OWWWW!! Please... please...  Raven, you're a pretty girl, you could escape this madness...
RAVEN => Escape to what, Honey?
HONEY => Well ...I'm sorry to hear that...
RAVEN => And one day I'm gonna commit revolutionary suicide for celluloid...
HONEY => OWWWW! Rodney, why do you want to hurt me? Gay men are supposed to be gentle...
RODNEY =>  That's just it, Honey! I'm not gay. I'm straight and I fucking hate it! Petie loves me but I can't love him back! I've tried! I kiss him and all I feel is beard.
RODNEY => (Suddenly snapping back
RAVEN => It's not Honey's fault.
RODNEY => Make them pay for me thinking about pussy! RODNEY rips out a clump of HONEY'S teased hair with brush.
HONEY => Oh God, stop...
RODNEY => 
HONEY WHITLOCK! => He blasts the blow drier on finished hairdo and flames singe her neck.
AHHHHHHHHH! => CECIL enters, now dressed in an even more elaborate Cecil B. DeMille-inspired movie director outfit.
