FITZGERALD => Likely got a splinter. Can't figure what to do without Mama here to pull it out for him.
BOONE => Need a doc, Captain?
HENRY => Gather more wood.
FITZGERALD =>  Shame my Pap was a broken down drunk. Else he could've bought me a Captain's job too.
FITZGERALD => We got a plan for these fires, Captain, or are we roastin' berries all the way up to Fort Union?
HENRY => Glass and the others will be back with some game, Fitzgerald. Just make sure you have the fires ready.
FITZGERALD => My supper's in the hands of a hermit nigger, a kid and a dummy. Hell, my belly feels full already.
VOICE => Shit fire, you got him, Mr. Glass!
PIG => Square as a barn door.
PIG => Right where you said he'd be.
BRIDGER => But bigger than we figured. Gonna be a load to haul back to camp.
PIG => Have to split it up I reckon.
GLASS => Yep. Bridger'll take the tail, and Pig you haul the rest.
BRIDGER => Another one close by?
PIG => Hugh?
BOONE => No rule says I'm the only one that's gotta gather this shit.
TRAPPER => `REE!
GLASS => GET TO THE BOAT!
GLASS =>  THE BOAT, CAPTAIN!
TRAPPER => WAIT!
BRIDGER => Thank you.
VOICE => HEY!
FITZGERALD => What's the plan, Captain?
FITZGERALD => Captain! What the hell do we do now?
ANDERSON => We're just floatin' farther from Fort Union.
GLASS => The Missouri's no good. Not if the `Ree's running it.
FITZGERALD => So we just float the hell down to Mexico or wherever else this river takes us?
GLASS => We get ourselves safe outta range, then track another course up.
FITZGERALD => Add weeks to the trip.
BRIDGER => Better that than endin' up scalped on the side of the river.
FITZGERALD =>  Shut up, kid, you don't get no say in this.
FITZGERALD =>  And in case you hadn't noticed, Captain, we're twelve men short of what we were. (off the badly wounded TRAPPER) Thirteen before long.
HENRY => I understand our situation, Mr. Fitzgerald. We do like Glass said... put some distance between us and the Arikara, then chart a course to Fort Union.
PIG => Reckon it's better `an lettin' the `Ree find him... take his ears... slice what's left all to shit.
HENRY => So we hike west to the Grand, then follow it up to Fort Union.
FITZGERALD => On foot? You got any idea how long that's gonna take? It'll be winter before we get there.
ANDERSON => Unless we come across a post... trade for some horses.
GLASS => No posts that far out.
FITZGERALD => So if we do this, we do every step with our own feet.
HENRY => We make camp here for the night, then load supplies and head out for the Grand at first light.  And gather extra blankets `cause there won't be any fires.
BRIDGER => Thank you... for what you done back there.
GLASS => You'd have done the same for me.
FITZGERALD => You treat that Anstadt sweeter than any woman, Glass.
STUBBY BILL => Never seen a woman that could stop a `Ree from three hundred feet.
ANDERSON => I knew a particular big-breasted redhead in Boston that might come close.
FITZGERALD => Bring it over here for me to have a look.
FITZGERALD => Did you hear what I said, boy?
BRIDGER =>  You seen it before.
FITZGERALD => What'd you say, kid?
BRIDGER =>  I said you shoulda already got a look when he saved you with it earlier.
FITZGERALD => You're lucky you ain't a man yet.  Else that mighta nicked somethin'.
FITZGERALD => And unlike you, I don't need savin' by him or nobody else. Remember that.
FITZGERALD => Lemme see what's so special `bout that shooter of yours.
GLASS => Middle of workin' on it.
FITZGERALD => Well you can stop workin' on it, and let me have a look like I said.
FITZGERALD => You forget your place?
GLASS => Best I can tell, my place is right where I want it... on the smart end of my rifle.
FITZGERALD => I'd be careful if I was you, boy.
HENRY => That's enough, Fitzgerald. Go sober up and get to sleep.  HENRY If you're passed out when we break camp tomorrow, I leave you here.
FITZGERALD => That's the trouble with this part of the world. No mirrors. Niggers forget what color they are.
HENRY => Can't sleep either?
GLASS => Never like closin' my eyes when I'm not sure who'll be standin' over me when I open `em.
HENRY => I keep thinking about Boone and the others... how maybe I should've had us make camp further up river.
GLASS => The tracks I saw... those `Ree had been tailin' us for a while. They'd have gone as far north as it took.  You're a good man, Captain. Soon as you realize that, these others will too.
HENRY => Your years trappin' and guidin' out here... have you had much experience with the Arikara?
GLASS => Enough to try and stay outta their way.
HENRY =>  But you know this country well enough to get us past them... up to Fort Union?
GLASS => I been here a long while. Whether that gets us to Union or not...
HENRY => What Fitzgerald said earlier... he doesn't speak for the rest.
GLASS => He wasn't wrong. Truth is that's what I prefer about this country... it's got no eye for the color of a man's skin.
HENRY =>  Try to get some sleep, Hugh.
STUBBY BILL => Shouldn't we have hit the Grand by now?
HENRY => We'll reach it soon enough. Glass said to keep this course.
FITZGERALD => Glass said. Too bad I don't see him.
PIG => That's on account he's up ahead makin' sure it's clear, and you get to keep your ears.
FITZGERALD => Or he's run off and left us.
BRIDGER => He wouldn't do that.
FITZGERALD => My bet, that nigger's used to runnin'.
HENRY => UP AHEAD!
BRIDGER => Christ Almighty.
HENRY => Glass!
PIG => HUGH!
BRIDGER => He's down here!
MURPHY => Oh, Jesus.
STUBBY BILL => He's tore to pieces.
ANDERSON => Least he took that Grizz down with him.
FITZGERALD => Wished he'da done it without firing his rifle. If there wasn't no `Ree around before, there will be now.
HENRY => THAT'S ENOUGH!
BRIDGER => Holy Christ, he's alive.
HENRY => Get me some water.
BRIDGER => Oh, Jesus... Jesus.
HENRY => It's okay, Hugh.  You're going to be fine.
HENRY =>  I need some rags before he bleeds out.
HENRY => And your whiskey.
HENRY => Hold him down, Bridger, goddammit.
HENRY => The rest of you spread out... scout a circle around us. Fitzgerald, you and Anderson take west and north. Murphy and Mike south and east. Watch for anyone that might've heard that shot.
PIG => What about me, Cap?
HENRY => Get down here and help me tie off these wounds best we can.
PIG => It won't stop bleedin'.
HENRY => Shut up, Pig.  We're fixing you up, Hugh.
BRIDGER => It's gonna be fine, Mr. Glass.
HENRY => Roll him over... easy.
HENRY => Get me the kit. We need to stitch his back up.
BRIDGER => What about the rest of him?
HENRY => He's losing more blood back here.  And I don't know what to do with that yet.
HENRY => I'm sorry for how this is about to burn, Hugh.
ANDERSON => They're torturin' the poor bastard.
FITZGERALD => And riskin' gettin' us killed in the process. Proper thing would be to end it for him quick.
ANDERSON => `Less he could pull through.
FITZGERALD => You seen what that grizz did to him. Shit, Glass'll be dead inside a hour. We all will be if he keeps screamin' like that.
BRIDGER => What now?
HENRY => We wait. Does he have any kin you know of?
PIG => He keeps to hisself. Never mentioned none.
HENRY => Go get the others. Tell `em we're making camp here for the night.
HENRY => And gather some wood, but make sure it's dry. We don't want much smoke when we cook that grizzly.
FITZGERALD => What makes you think you earned a claw?
FITZGERALD => You didn't take that grizz down.
BRIDGER => It ain't for me.
PIG => I can feel some air outta his mouth. Maybe Captain sealed up his throat proper, huh?  Whatta you figure his odds are, Jim?
BRIDGER => Long.
MURPHY => What that bear did to him... I didn't expect he'd last this long.
ANDERSON => I seen a fella go a week once after a lion jumped him. Fever finally finished him off.
STUBBY BILL => Whatta we do, Cap?
HENRY => We give him his chance.
FITZGERALD => You ain't doin' him or us no favors, Captain, lettin' him suffer that way.
ANDERSON => Fever's hit. Won't be long now.
FITZGERALD => I seen a bad one drag on days.
FITZGERALD => Insides shut down... flesh starts to spoil and turn. Ain't no way for...
HENRY => Quiet, Fitzgerald.
FITZGERALD =>  We keep sittin' here watchin' him die, only gives the `Ree more chance to find us.
BRIDGER => He's burnin', Cap. Water turns to boil as soon as it touches him.
HENRY => Pig, take Anderson and scout ahead. Grand should be just west of here. Find us the best route.
FITZGERALD => Tryin' to buy Glass time don't make sense for the rest of us, Captain.
HENRY =>  Get movin'.
HENRY =>  You two can start digging a grave.
FITZGERALD => Least it's a step in the right direction.
FITZGERALD => Any coyote digs that deep deserves the meal.
FITZGERALD => Glass won't know the difference no ways.
PIG => Found it, Cap. Right where Glass had us headed.
ANDERSON => No more than a mile or so out.
HENRY => We could build a litter. Haul him with us.
ANDERSON => It's rocky and steep goin'.
PIG => Marshy and thick on the other side. We could try it, but...
FITZGERALD => I signed on as a trapper, not a goddamn mule.
BRIDGER =>  Shape he's in... I don't see no way he'd make bein' drug.
HENRY => Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr. Bridger.
BRIDGER => But, Captain.
HENRY => Do it.
HENRY => Step clear, Mr. Bridger.
HENRY => There's a seventy dollar bonus from the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to the two men that stay with Glass... see this through. Then give him a proper burial.
BRIDGER => I'll stay with him... money or not.
PIG => Same here.
HENRY => I can't let you stay back, Pig. Without Glass, I'll need you to scout.
HENRY => Just need one more.
FITZGERALD => Two won't stand much chance against a party of `Ree, Captain, and seventy dollars won't buy me a new setta ears.
HENRY => A hundred then.
BRIDGER => They can have my share too. I owe Glass that at least.
FITZGERALD => That case I'll hang back with the kid. I don't mind fallin' a day or so behind for two hundred.
HENRY => But Glass is to be cared for until. Understood?
FITZGERALD =>  I'll let the young doctor do his job.
HENRY => The rest gather your gear.
PIG => I'll see ya at Fort Union, Hugh.
HENRY =>  As long as necessary.
BRIDGER => I'll look after him.
FITZGERALD => I'll take first watch.
BRIDGER => Not with his rifle.
FITZGERALD => Trust me, kid, he ain't gonna be needin' it tonight.
FITZGERALD => You were right to protect this.
FITZGERALD =>  When are you gonna die, boy?
FITZGERALD => I'm nearly a week behind Henry's bunch on accounta havin' to tend to you. Be easier on us all if you'd take that last breath.
FITZGERALD => I could help ya with that if you'd like. Muzzle ya right now... end all this sufferin' quick and easy. Nobody'd ever know you give up.
FITZGERALD => You just gimme a blink if you want me to do it.
BRIDGER => What's goin' on?
FITZGERALD => Don't you ever question me, you little piss-ant.
FITZGERALD => I'd just as soon leave both you and your nigger here to rot. `Cept killin' you ain't worth givin' up your share.  But that don't mean I can't be coaxed into changin' my mind.
FITZGERALD => And I was just doin' your job... cleanin' him up.
FITZGERALD => Why don't ya pour some more broth down his throat... keep him alive another week so we can fall farther back. End up walkin' all the way to Fort Union on our own. `Ree would love to poach on just two.  I promise ya, you'll look a helluva lot worse than Glass when they're done with you.
FITZGERALD =>  Bridger! Get your ass up!
FITZGERALD => `Ree.
BRIDGER => What?
FITZGERALD => Keep quiet. I was down at the creek... there's twenty of `em at least, comin' this way.
BRIDGER => Oh, shit. Whatta we do?
FITZGERALD => We run. Now.
BRIDGER => What about Glass?
FITZGERALD => He's on his own, same as us.
BRIDGER => I can't leave him.
FITZGERALD => Then I'm talkin' to a dead man.
FITZGERALD => Move.
BRIDGER => What're you doin'? He needs that.
FITZGERALD => He couldn't hold it if you tarred it to his hands.
BRIDGER => It's his goddamn rifle! That's all he's got!
FITZGERALD => And more than he'll need.
BRIDGER => We can't leave him with nothin'.
FITZGERALD => We ran the better part of six hours. Had to gain some ground on Henry and them others.
BRIDGER => Best douse that smoke before them `Ree spot it.
FITZGERALD => We put enough distance between us and them. And it's too damn cold to go without one.
BRIDGER => All we know, they hoofed it through the night same as us.
FITZGERALD =>  A dozen `Ree can't make the time us two did.
BRIDGER => It was twenty earlier.
FITZGERALD => What?
BRIDGER => When you woke me... you said you'd spotted twenty `Ree.
FITZGERALD => A dozen... twenty. I wasn't in a mood to count feathers. Hell, one `Ree woulda been too many.
BRIDGER => What was you even doin' down at the creak in the middle of the night?  I'd already brought plenty a water.
BRIDGER => Answer me.
FITZGERALD => Don't start questionin' me on accounta you feelin' guilty `bout leavin' your nigger buddy behind.
BRIDGER => ANSWER ME OR I BLOW YOUR DAMN HEAD OFF!
FITZGERALD => What're you askin'? Why it was you turned your back on Glass? Why you let him die to save your own sorry skin?  `Cause you was scared shitless, that's why.
BRIDGER => The `Ree... did you see `em?  DID YOU SEE `EM?
FITZGERALD =>  Not a one.
FITZGERALD => So that there is the answer to your question.
FITZGERALD => And the next time you aim to kill somebody, kid, best remember your gun won't fire without a flint.
BRIDGER => I'm goin' back for him.
FITZGERALD => Far as we ran all night, you couldn't find Glass with dogs and a map. And I don't believe you really want to. `Cause after leavin' him to die the first time, I doubt he'd be too happy to see you now.
FITZGERALD => And just so we're clear. If you try to backtrack without me knowin', or ever get so guilty you feel the need to tell somebody.
FITZGERALD => I'll have no choice but to gut you from nuts to nose.
FITZGERALD => Now let's go.
HIS FOREARM. => He shakes it free, but can't escape the snake's next strike... locking its jaws onto Glass' burned throat. Glass opens his mouth to scream.
SPOTTED HORSE => Griz-lee.
FITZGERALD => `Bout goddamn time.
FITZGERALD => And we're understood on everything... Glass' dyin' in his sleep... us buryin' him like was agreed.
FITZGERALD => You're as guilty as me in leavin' him. Don't you forget that. You got a future up here. No sense tossin' it away when he was as good as dead already. Shit, all we did was skip the funeral.
FITZGERALD => I won't take to givin' up that two- hundred on accounta you gettin' weak-kneed.
FITZGERALD => Twice the folks here than when we left.
BRIDGER => We should go see Captain Henry.
FITZGERALD => Far as we hiked... we got time for a drink on the company's tab.
PIG => Jim!
PIG => You made it! I was scared the `Ree mighta caught up to ya.
FITZGERALD => If your fat ass could get through, we didn't have no worries.
PIG =>  Had to be a helluva long walk for you.
PIG => Hugh?
PIG => Guess we all knowed how it would turn out. Did he suffer much more?
BRIDGER => I hope not.
FITZGERALD =>  Maybe we best go see Henry, kid. I just got a itch to spend the first of my two-hundred.
FITZGERALD => I won't pretend to been his friend, but I respect any man that fights the way he done.
HENRY => And the grave?
FITZGERALD => We had those extra days so we went deeper... covered it in rocks. To keep the scavengers off him.
HENRY => Any sign of hostiles?
FITZGERALD => Not a one.
FITZGERALD => Truth is, I was worried `bout `Ree, and ready to get movin', but Bridger here argued to stay and make a cross for the grave.
FITZGERALD => So that's what we did.
HENRY => Glad to hear you pulled your weight, Mr. Bridger. I knew you would.
FITZGERALD => More than his share, Captain.
HENRY => Speaking of shares.
HENRY => Am I to assume the agreed arrangement didn't change?
FITZGERALD => Fortunate for me, it did not.
HENRY => Well thank you both for your courage and honor. You have done yourselves proud.
HENRY => You're owed something for what you did.
FITZGERALD => He's beat hisself up most of the trip... wishin' he'da done more.
HENRY => We all saw the shape Glass was in. There was no more to be done.
FITZGERALD => That's what I been tellin' him.
GLASS =>  Thank you.
GLASS => Bad medicine.
GLASS => How long have I been here?
GLASS => You're Sioux. I only know a bit a Pawnee.
GLASS => The snow... my healin'.  Me.  Here. How long?
GLASS => How many suns? Ten?
GLASS => Ten suns?
GLASS => Christ.
BOYS => Tatanka Wicasa.
SPOTTED HORSE => Buff-A-lo Man.
Spotted Horse =>  What they call you.  Fur of Buff-A-lo.
GLASS => You speak English.
SPOTTED HORSE => Need words when trade with whites.
GLASS => Well I'm grateful for you bringing me here... havin' them care for me.  Now if you could point me which way it is you do your tradin'... with the whites.
SPOTTED HORSE =>  Whites. Bra-zo.
GLASS => Fort Brazeau? That's where I'm tryin' to get. Is it far from here?
GLASS => Far? Long way?
GLASS => Three days on horse?
SPOTTED HORSE => Not walk. Hides soon.
Spotted Horse => We trade Bra-zo.
Spotted Horse => Come. Eat.
GLASS => The men stole my rifle.
GLASS => They took. They took...
GLASS => ...my rifle. My gear.
GLASS => They left me to die. So I mean to find `em both. Get my rifle back.
SPOTTED HORSE => Red Hawk ask who kill griz-lee.
GLASS => Grizzly?
RED HAWK => Arikara.
SPOTTED HORSE => He say Arikara take right ear of Sioux. Left ear of whites. Not know what they take from you.
SPOTTED HORSE => Buff-A-lo Man hunt with Sioux?
THREE FEATHERS => Tatanka Wicasa.
BOYS => Tatanka Wicasa! Tatanka Wicasa!
GLASS => Thank you.
SPOTTED HORSE => Good hunt.
GLASS => Yes.
SPOTTED HORSE => You. Fam-i-lee?
GLASS =>  No.
SPOTTED HORSE => No wom-an?  Wakayaja?
GLASS => No. Not for a long time.
Spotted Horse => Bra-zo.
GLASS =>  Tatanka Wicasa.
GLASS => Nice.
SPOTTED HORSE =>  Nice.
SPOTTED HORSE => Sleep. No Arikara.
SPOTTED HORSE => Me sleep.
FITZGERALD => No... please.
SPOTTED HORSE => We go.
BRAZEAU =>  Bon jour, Spotted Horse. You come with many hides I hope.  We make good trades then.
BRAZEAU => Monsieur Glass?
GLASS => Good to see you again, Mr. Brazeau.
BRAZEAU => Jesus Christ, what happened to your goddamned face?
GLASS => Had a tussle with a grizzly.
BRAZEAU => And now the grizzly, he don't look so good either, eh?
BRAZEAU =>  You run with the Sioux these days?
GLASS => They looked after me for a spell. I'm on my way to catch back up with Captain Henry... at Fort Union. Needed to trade for some supplies on the Company's credit if I could.
BRAZEAU => Oui, of course. Anything you like.
GLASS => We can start with this.
BRAZEAU => You can pick up the horse at the livery in the morning.  I wish I could give you a room for the night, but...
BRAZEAU => I cannot risk the trouble of letting a colored stay inside.
GLASS => Won't be the last night I sleep on the ground.
BRAZEAU => Take care of that face, Glass.
GLASS =>  You stay here tonight?
SPOTTED HORSE => Your people?
GLASS => No.
SPOTTED HORSE => You come then.
GLASS => Fort Union.
SPOTTED HORSE => You spend your life hunting enemy. Enemy wins.
GLASS => It will be over soon.
GLASS =>  Thank you.
FITZGERALD => I had enough of this cold as hell shit.
ANDERSON => What'd you figure when ya signed on outta that St. Louis whorehouse you was workin'? That you was headin' off to paradise?
FITZGERALD => I tell ya what I figured, I figured I'd be somewhere the piss wouldn't freeze before I got it outta my pecker.
BRIDGER => Figured wrong.
FITZGERALD => Waste a time to check traps in this weather... while Henry sits warmin' his ass on the stove in his office.
STUBBY BILL => Why don't you go tell him that, Fitz? Then start your hike back to St. Louie.
FITZGERALD => Shit, I walked up here, I got no problem walkin' back.
MURPHY => Contracted for twelve months. We all did.
FITZGERALD => Henry can shove that contract up his toasty warm ass, or I'll do it for him.
FITZGERALD => You don't think I will?
ANDERSON => Just give that fat little whore you're so sweet on a couple extra bits... she'll have you thinkin' it's Spring already.
FITZGERALD => Hello? Captain?
MURPHY => Where're you headed?
FITZGERALD => To the river, Murphy.
MURPHY => That you, Fitzgerald?
FITZGERALD => Left my rifle down there... don't want it out all night.
MURPHY => That weren't too smart.
FITZGERALD => Just don't take a shot at me when I come back in.
MURPHY => We'll see.
FITZGERALD => Not that you'd hit me if you tried.
GLASS =>  I'm Hugh Glass of...
RUNTY MAN => We don't serve niggers.
GLASS => Of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company on my way to Fort Union.
RUNTY MAN => I don't care if you was with Lewis and Clark headed for the new world. We don't serve niggers.
GLASS => All I need is a horse and enough supplies to...
TRAPPER => Ice musta froze up his ears, `cause he ain't listenin' to you, Cees.
GLASS => ...to get me to Fort Union. I can sign a draft made good by Captain Henry.
RUNTY MAN => What the fuck happened to your face, boy? You try to slice all the black off?
TRAPPER #2 => Maybe we oughta help him do it right.
FAT TRAPPER => Best get on your way, boy.
GLASS => I'm Hugh Glass of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, and all I need is...
RUNTY MAN =>  Do you believe this shit?
FAT TRAPPER => Hell, I warned ya.
GLASS => All I need...
GLASS => ...is a horse and enough supplies to get me to Fort Union.
GLASS => And this shooter here. All made good by Captain Henry and The Rocky Mountain Fur Company.
RUNTY MAN => Shoot him, goddammit!
TRAPPER #2 => I can't get a clear look.
RUNTY MAN => Shoot `em both!
RUNTY MAN => Get after the son of a bitch!
TRAPPER #2 => It's cold as hell, Cees.
FAT TRAPPER => And he did say to put it all on the Rocky Mountain tab.
STUBBY BILL => Jesus Christ.
BRIDGER => I'm sorry.
GLASS => You took everything I had... left me to die.
GLASS => Why?
BRIDGER => I was scared of dyin'.  But every day since, I've wished I had.
GLASS => There wasn't no `Ree that night, was there?
BRIDGER => No.
HENRY => Hugh. Wait.
GLASS => Where's Fitzgerald and my rifle?
HENRY => Deserted two days ago. Along with about five hundred dollars of company money.  Let's get some coffee to warm you up. (to Glass, but looking at BRIDGER) I wanna hear what happened.
BRIDGER => Wait. Please!
GLASS => I cut the shoes loose of her, and hiked over to Fort Talbot.
STUBBY BILL => Christ almighty.
GLASS => And you may hear from the fella there about a stoled horse and supplies charged to you.
HENRY => We'll take care of it. You should go settle in.
MURPHY => There's a couple fair whores next door that'll ease the miles on ya, scars or not.
ANDERSON => Jesus, Murph.
MURPHY => I just meant I'd go roust one of `em for ya if you wanted.
GLASS => She can take the night off, but I wouldn't mind the use of her bed.
HENRY =>  Go clear out a room. The rest head on back to bunk.
PIG => I told ya I'd see ya up here. You remember that, Hugh?
GLASS => I do, Pig. You must have a little gypsy in ya.
PIG => I'll see ya in the mornin'.
HENRY => Can I talk you outta what you're planning?
GLASS => Thank you for what you done for me... stitchin' me back together... givin' me a chance.
HENRY => I'm offerin' you another right now... to stay here... let this thing go.
GLASS =>  He thinks he let me die. But he don't know that he's the one that's kept me alive... for the chance of findin' him... makin' him pay for what he done.
HENRY => The law will make Fitzgerald pay.
GLASS => You told me once that other men didn't think like him.  But the truth is, most do. I seen it my whole life... the looks folks give... the whisperin'. I watched my wife and son die from the fever on accounta no white doctor would care for `em. Wasn't no different to them than if their neighbor's dog was sick.  So I don't figure nobody's gonna care much that Fitzgerald took some dyin' nigger's rifle, and left him in the middle of nowhere.  Do you, Captain?
GLASS => I thank you for the coffee.
MURPHY => He said he was goin' to get his rifle...
MURPHY => Your rifle. But he never showed back up. The next day I figured him mighta fell in, but then Pig seen the canoe was missin'.
PIG => And the Captain found the money gone.
GLASS => I'll make my way down river. See what turns up.
STUBBY BILL => The kid's gone... gear and all. Musta slipped out before light.
STUBBY BILL => Just left this on his bunk.
HENRY =>  "Every day I think about what I done. I want to tell Pig and the others the truth but am afraid what they'll think of me. I look at Fitzgerald and want to kill him but am afraid to try. I am a coward and wish he hadn't been lyin about the Ree that night. I wish they had come and kilt us both."
GLASS => If I run across the boy, I'll send him back your way.
GLASS => Where're you headed?
HENRY => Fitzgerald stole five hundred dollars. Rocky Mountain Fur Company wants him too.
GLASS => I can do this on my own.
HENRY => I know you can. But maybe you won't have to.
RUNTY MAN => We ain't got no food to spare, friend, if that's what you're lookin' for.
FITZGERALD => Then what the hell have ya got?
RUNTY MAN => Whiskey and blankets mostly. Weather's held back deliveries.
FITZGERALD => Gimme a couple bottles then. Goddamn ice shredded my boat. Been walkin' for two days.
FITZGERALD => How much for one of them horses out there?
RUNTY MAN => Horses ain't cheap this time a year.
FITZGERALD => Whatever the price, Rocky Mountain Fur Company's good for it.
RUNTY MAN => You're the second son of a bitch come in here makin' that claim. And the first one left a bad taste.
FITZGERALD => That right? Well I don't know nothin' about that. Just that I need a horse.
RUNTY MAN => So did this other fella. So he stole one... along with Lange's pistola.
FITZGERALD => Fine then, I'll pay cash for the horse. How much?
RUNTY MAN => How `bout you pay for your friend's too.
TRAPPER #1 => And my shooter.
FITZGERALD => Wasn't my friend.
TRAPPER #1 => Then from where I stand, you don't got no friends at all.
FITZGERALD => Yeah, okay. I'll collect from him. How much?
RUNTY MAN => How `bout we say eighty... (sees Fitzgerald doesn't ARGUE) ...five.
FITZGERALD => You boys are leavin' me with nothin'. Better be a helluva horse.
RUNTY MAN => Pick of the litter.
RUNTY MAN => And when you see that scarred-up nigger, you tell him he'd best not show up here again.
FITZGERALD => When I see who?
RUNTY MAN => The black son of a bitch that robbed me. You tell him that.
FITZGERALD => Scarred up, you say... and headed up to Union?
RUNTY MAN => That's what he told us. Seemed real anxious to get there too.
FITZGERALD =>  I'll make sure to give him the message when I find him.
HENRY => Hugh.
HENRY => That's it.
GLASS => Ice tore it up.
GLASS => If the snow holds off, we'll have a good trail to track.
HENRY => What's out that direction? Talbot?
GLASS => And the Missouri. Doubt he'd risk the river with the `Ree. Likely grab a horse, and cross over high... take his chances goin' east against the weather. When'd you say he skipped out?
HENRY => Three days ago now.
GLASS => We best pick up our pace.
HENRY => This was Fitzgerald camped here?
GLASS => Couple nights back. But these tracks aren't all his.
HENRY => He's travelin' with somebody?
GLASS =>  Came in after. Prints are smooth. Mocassins.
GLASS => Could be Sioux... Blackfoot even.
HENRY => But you figure they're `Ree.
GLASS => I don't figure nothin', Captain. But whoever it is, they're a good day behind Fitzgerald.
GLASS => And they're on his trail too, so we should keep it quiet... don't announce we're back here.
HENRY => You told me once you knew enough to keep away from the `Ree.
GLASS => I do.
HENRY => You figure this is smart then?
GLASS => You're welcome to head back, Captain.
HENRY => What if we find Fitzgerald... and I ask you not to do this?
GLASS => Don't ask me.
HENRY =>  `Ree?
HENRY => There!
GLASS => Wait!
HENRY => So much for stayin' quiet.
HENRY => Guess you would've been better off on your own.
GLASS => We needed to pick up some time anyways.
HENRY => Whatta ya got?
GLASS => Smoke.
GLASS => No more than mile out that way.  I'll head in from the west... you take the east.
HENRY => What if it's `Ree?
GLASS => Then we leave `em be... meet back up here.
FITZGERALD => Didn't figure an important man like you to be away from your stove on a night as cold as this, Captain. You lost?
HENRY => I'm here to save your life.
FITZGERALD => I done told you boys... I don't need savin' by you or nobody else.
GLASS => You shouldn't a come.
GLASS =>  Arikara take right ear of Sioux. Left ear of whites. Not know what they take from you.
FITZGERALD =>  Help me!  Glass... please!
GLASS => I am Tatanka Wicasa! I have killed whites and I have killed Arikara and I have killed grizzly! AND I WILL KILL YOU!
GLASS => COME ON!
