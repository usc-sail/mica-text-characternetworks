MOM => Who wants fruit salad?
MISTY => I do, please.
MOM =>  That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
MISTY =>  It's sugarless.
MOM =>  You know how I hate gum, Misty.  All that chomping and cheesing... 
MISTY => Sorry, Mom.  Thanks. (To her brother, as she prices a record album) Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
CHIP => I wouldn't give ya a nickle.
MISTY =>  Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
MOM =>  And who may I ask is Carl?
MISTY => Just a boy.  He's picking me up this morning.
CHIP => Here we go again.
MISTY => He's really cute!
MOM =>  Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
CHIP => She sure can pick 'em!
MISTY =>  He goes to college with me!
DAD => Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
MOM => Cereal anybody?
DAD => Just a little, please.  Bad for the teeth.
CHIP => Always the dentist.
MOM => Chip, honey?
CHIP => Thanks, Mom.
DAD =>  Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
MOM =>  That's nice.
DAD => Nice?!  He should have been executed!
MISTY => He killed people, Mom.
MOM =>  We all have bad nights. (Gets ready to swat, but fly buzzes off)
CHIP =>  You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute!  Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
DAD => I certainly did not.
MISTY => You've been working in that video shop too long.
DAD => And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
CHIP => I do great in school, Dad. 
DAD => Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
CHIP =>  Aw, Mom!  I hate Mr. Stubbins!
MOM =>  Don't say the word "hate", honey. "Hate" is a very serious word!
MOM => There.  All better.  Anybody for scrambled eggs?
DAD =>  Who on earth...?
DET. MOORE => Mrs. Sutphin?
MOM =>  Yes?
DET. MOORE =>  I'm Detective Moore and this is Detective Bradford.
DAD =>  I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin.  What's the trouble, officer?
CHIP =>  Is there a killer loose?
DET. MOORE => No son, nothing that exciting.
MOM => This is my son, Chip...and my daughter, Misty.
MISTY =>  Hi!
CHIP =>  Jeeezzz!
MOM => Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
DET. BRADFORD =>  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
MOM => I know Dottie!
DAD => She lives right down the street.
DET. BRADFORD => Could you take a look at this...
DET. MOORE => ...And tell us of anybody who might be responsible?
DET. BRADFORD =>  I should warn you...this note contains LANGUAGE.
MOM =>  Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
CHIP => Let me see!
DAD => Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
MOM => Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
DAD => No woman would!
MOM =>  Look officers!  Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie?  Listen to his call.  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!
BIRD => Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!
MOM => Chip, your ride is here.
DAD =>  Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
DET. MOORE => Thanks for your time, everybody.
MISTY =>  Bye, Detective Moore.
BIRDIE =>  Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Sutphin.
DAD =>  That's Birdie.  She's a horror nut just like my son.
MOM =>  Good morning, Birdie.  This is Detectives Moore and Bradford.
BIRDIE =>  I didn't do it!  I swear!  Don't lock me up!  I'll take a lie detector!   Hi ya, boys!
MOM =>  Good morning Scotty!
BIRDIE => Hey Misty, look what I got!  A Pee Wee Herman Doll.  Can you sell it for me at the flea market?
MISTY =>  Wow!  Still in the box!  I sure can! (Looks up and sees a Trans Am speeding towards the house) Oh God, here comes Carl!
CARL =>  You must be Mrs. Sutphin. I'm Carl Padgett.
MOM => Misty's date...
CARL => More of a friend really...
MISTY =>  See what Birdie gave me to sell at the flea market?
CARL =>  That guy's a weirdo.
MOM =>  Now there's something you should be interested in, detectives.  A grown boy who doesn't wear his seat belts!
DET. BRADFORD =>  Christ, that one was Beaver Cleaver's mother.  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!  Peter Pan!
DET. MOORE =>  Oh, leave her alone.  Mrs. Sutphin's about as normal and nice a lady we're ever going to find.
DOTTIE =>  Hello.
MOM =>  Is this the Cocksucker residence?
DOTTIE =>  Goddamn you!  STOP CALLING HERE!
MOM => Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
DOTTIE =>  You bitch!
MOM => Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
DOTTIE => The police are tracing your call right this minute.
MOM => Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
DOTTIE =>  FUCK YOU! 
MRS. ACKERMAN =>  Beverly?  Beverly darling? You home?  I know you are...
DOTTIE =>  FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
MOM =>  I beg your pardon?
DOTTIE =>  Who is this?
MOM => Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company.  I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
DOTTIE =>  Yes, I am...I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson.. It's driving me crazy...I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!
MOM =>  What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
DOTTIE => I can't say it out loud. don't use bad language.
MOM =>  I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
DOTTIE => Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker".  That's what she calls me.
MOM =>  Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
DOTTIE =>  GODDAMN YOU!
DOTTIE => MOTHERFUCKER!!
MOM => COCKSUCKER! 
MRS. ACKERMAN => Beverly, are you alright?
MOM => Rosemary, honey.  Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
MRS. ACKERMAN => It's the least I could do.  I heard shouting.
MOM =>  Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
MRS. ACKERMAN => Yes, I did.  It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
MOM => Who on earth would want to harrass poor Dottie Hinkle?
MRS. TAPLOTTER => But, Mr. Stubbins, my son studies every night!  He's trying as hard as he can...
MR. STUBBINS => Some teenagers just aren't college material, Mrs, Taplotter.  It's nothing to cry over.  Now, there are other parents waiting.  ...thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
MRS. STERNER => Hi, Beverly.
MOM => Hi, Betty.  Oh, I love your outfit.
MRS. STERNER => Thanks.  It's a Liz Claiborne.
MR. STERNER => Mrs. Sutphin, where's that husband of yours? (Making a bad dental joke and pointing to his teeth) Feeling "down in the mouth"?! Hohohohohoho!
MOM =>  You're soooo funny, Ralph...
MR. STUEBINS => Mrs...Sutphin?
MOM =>  Right here!
MR. STUBBINS => Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
MOM =>  Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
MR. STUBBINS =>  Oooohh!  A fruit cake.  Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin.  Have a seat.
MOM => Bon Appetit!
MR. STUBBINS => Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused...conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
MOM =>  He's a good boy.
MR. STUBBINS =>  There is one big problem though.
MOM => What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
MR. STUBBINS =>  His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
MOM =>  He is assistant manager of a video shop...
MR. STUBBINS =>  That's no excuse for a morbid imagination.  I caught him drawing this in class last week. (Unfolds lurid drawing of woman getting her tongue pulled out with the title, "Blood Feast") Is there a problem at home?
MOM =>  Certainly not!
MR. STUBBINS => Divorce?  An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
MOM =>  No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
MR. STUBBINS => Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin.  I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
BIRDIE => It's a sheep's tongue!
SCOTTY => Man, I just ate.  Turn it off.
CHIP => Rewind it!  Let's see it again!
SCOTTY => No!  That shit is sickening! Put on pussy!
BIRDIE =>  Look, Dick-Head!  SLOW-MOTION!
BIRDIE =>  BLOOD FEAST!
CHIP =>  The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
MOM => I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
SCOTTY =>  Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
CHIP => Hi, Mom.
BIRDIE => Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
MOM =>  You kids.  Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
CHIP => But Mom, the video's not over.
MOM => No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 
BIRDIE =>  Oh, boy! 
CHIP => Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
SCOTTY => Man, that one made me puke!
MOM =>  You forgot something...
SCOTTY =>  Are we leaving?
MOM => Yes you are.
BIRDIE => Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
CHIP =>  Bye, bird-brain,  See ya, Scotty.
MOM => Bye, Birdie. (Sitting down next to CHIP on his bed) Chip, honey...I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand.. I'm your mother and I love you.
CHIP => Oh Mom...
MOM =>  Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart?  PLEEEASE?
MOM =>  Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
CHIP => Looks good, Mom!
DAD => Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
MOM => Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
MISTY => Yummy.  Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
MOM =>  Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
CHIP => Carl's a jerk!
DAD => He certainly drives like a jerk.
MISTY =>  Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
DAD => Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
MOM => I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
CHIP =>  I'm so happy I could shit.
MOM => CHIP!  You know how much I hate the brown word!
MRS. ACKERMAN => Beverly!  Beverly!
MOM => That's Rosemary.  Something's wrong!
MRS. ACKERMAN => Turn on the news!  A teacher at your school has been murdered!
MISTY =>  Murdered?
CHIP => Who?
MRS. ACKERMAN => A Mr. Stubber...or Stubbins.
CHIP =>  MR. STUBBINS?  That's my math teacher!
DAD => What channel?
MRS. ACKERMAN => It's on all of them!
CHIP => Hello.
BIRDIE =>  Did you hear?
CHIP => What happened?
BIRDIE => This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.
CHIP => It's on!  I'll call you back! 
ANNOUNCER => ..Police claim the driver of the hit and run vehicle ran down the teacher in cold blood and then backed up over his body to finish off the job. Mr. Paul Stubbins was thirty-eight years old...
DAD =>  Whoever did it should get the death penalty!
ANNOUNCER => ...So far only one eyewitness has surfaced.
LUANN => It was a blue car...I know that much!
CHIP => That's Lu-Ann Hodges!
MISTY => She's a pothead!
LUANN => ...A blue station wagon...
MRS. ACKERMAN => That's like your car, Beverly,
MOM =>  I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
CHIP =>   I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
MISTY => You said you hated him.
CHIP => Well...he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
DAD =>  Goodnight, honey.  Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
MOM =>  I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
DAD => Goodnight, honey.
MOM => Don't I get a kiss?
DAD =>  I just thought with all the sadness...you wouldn't want...
MOM =>  We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
DAD =>  It's fine with me, Beverly. (Kisses her again more passionately) You want to, honey?  You think the kids are asleep?
MOM => We can be real quiet...
DAD =>  I love that you're my wife.
MOM =>  You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
DAD =>  You bring me such peace...
MOM => Oohhhh, Eugene!
DAD => Shhhh..
MOM =>  Oooohhhh.
DAD => Don't wake the kids...
MOM =>  Ooohhhh!
MOM => Oooohhh!  Yeah!  Yeah!
DAD =>  You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet!  Shhhh! The kids!
MOM => Yeah!  Oohhhh!  Get it!
DAD => Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now!  Now!
MOM =>  Oohhhhh!  Yeah!  Yeah!
MOM =>  There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee!  He's here every morning for breakfast.
DAD =>  Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know.  No wonder Dede's hungry.  It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
DAD => Hello...
MR. STERNER => Eugene, it's Ralph Sterner. Got a dental emergency here!  I mean this goddamn tooth is killing me!
DAD => Well, Mr. Sterner, if you call my office, I'm sure we can see you Monday.
MR. STERNER => MONDAY?
MRS. STERNER => Eugene, this is Betty Sterner, He'll die by Monday!  The roots are infected!  He might have a heart attack!
DAD =>  All right, Mrs. Sterner... Nine o'clock.
DAD =>  I'm sorry, honey.  But the birds will still be there next week.
MOM =>  It's Ok, Eugene.  I understand.. I'll go fix breakfast. 
MOM =>  CHIP!!
CHIP =>  God, Mom!  What's the matter?
MOM =>  Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
CHIP => You scared me.
MOM => Honey, what's the matter?
MISTY => I'm stoodup!  I'll kill that bastard!
MOM => Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
MISTY => It's him!
MOM => No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
DET. BRADFORD => Good morning, Mrs. Sutphin.
MISTY =>  Hi, Detective Moore.
DET. MOORE =>  Morning, Misty.  Mrs. Sutphin, I presume you heard of the death of Mr. Stubbins.
MOM => A fine man.  A good teacher...
DET. BRADFORD =>  Contrusions...fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
MOM =>  What a mess.
MOM =>  No, honey, it's just Scotty.  Scotty, who doesn't wear his seatbelts!
DAD => Good morning, Detectives.
BIRDIE =>  Nightmare on Calverton Court!
SCOTTY => The Maryland Teacher Massacre!
DET. MOORE => That's not funny, son.
DET. BRADFORD => Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
MOM =>  Yes, I did.
DAD =>  Detectives, what is this about?
DET. MOORE => I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
DAD => Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!
SCOTTY =>  SHE DID IT!  Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
MOM =>  From what I understand, the eye-witness is a drug user.
MISTY => I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
DAD => Misty, that's a terrible thing to say! (Putting his arm protectively around MOM) Detectives, it's time for you to leave.  My wife knows nothing about this terrible ...accident.
MOM =>  Murder, honey.
SCOTTY =>  Now, here's a babe!
DET. MOORE =>  Let's see that, young man.
MISTY =>  Nice buns!
DET. BRADFORD => "P" as in...
MOM =>  ...People who don't mind their own business.
MOM =>  It's Mrs. Ackerman's magazine, honey.  Look at the subscription label if you don't believe me.  I recycle my magazines.
MOM =>  "It's Daybreak" If you want to believe It can be Daybreak!..."
MOM => Don't forget me, boys!  All rinsed and ready to recycle!
GUS => Morning, Mrs. Sutphin.
MOM => Morning, Gus.  Hello, Sloppy. (Sneakily handing them miniatures) Here you go.  You work hard for the environment.  A little drink never hurt anybody.
SLOPPY => Thanks, ma'am.  Damn!  Good stuff. (Looking at MRS. ACKERMAN's garbage) Do you believe that goddamn litterbugger?
MOM =>  I've told her!  It takes ninety to one hundred years for a tin can to decompose but she still won't recycle.
GUS =>  Cost taxpayers millions of dollars last year but she don't care about the national budget!
MOM =>  I HATE Mrs. Ackerman.
GUS =>  I hate her too.
SLOPPY =>  I HATE HER GUTS!  Somebody ought to kill her!
GUS =>  Yeah, hack her up and recycle her!
MOM =>  For the sake of this planet, SOMEBODY JUST MIGHT!
JOAN =>  ...But your boyfriend was convicted of killing twelve people
HAG => I don't judge him.
JOAN => How can you love a mass-murderer?
HAG => Easy!  He's handsome.  He's famous.  AND WE GET CONJUGAL VISITS!
JOAN =>  SERIAL HAGS!  Woman Who Love Men Who Mutilate!  We'll be right back after this!
DOTTIE => Turn it off.
MRS. ACKERMAN => Violence is everywhere these days
MRS. ACKERMAN =>  Oh, it's just Beverly.
DOTTIE => She scared me.
MRS. ACKERMAN =>  Come in, Beverly.  Have some coffee
MOM =>  Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie.  I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
DOTTIE => It's not fair!!
MOM =>  Are those pussy-willows?
MRS. ACKERMAN =>  Dried ones.  Aren't they pretty?
DOTTIE =>  What did you just say?
MOM =>  PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
MOM => Dottie!  Watch what you're doing!
DOTTIE =>  I didn't do it!
ROSEMARY =>  My Franklin Mint Faberge Egg!
MOM =>  Dottie didn't mean to be a clumsy ox.  She's sorry, Aren't you, Dottie?
DOTTIE =>  Rosemary, I didn't break your egg - she did!
MRS. ACKERMAN => You could at least apologize, Dottie.  I collect Franklin Mint!
MOM => And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
DOTTIE =>  But...but...she...Rosemary, I heard her voice!  It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
DAD => Mr. Sterner, you've lost a tiny filling.  I have to drill deeply enough to remove all the decay.
MR. STERNER =>  Alright...go ahead...but be careful, it really hurts! 
MR. STERNER => OWWWWW'! Goddamn you!  You're hurting me on purpose!
MRS. STERNER =>  Are you ok, Ralph?
DAD => Mrs. Sterner, please stay in the waiting room!
MR. STERNER => Help me, Betty!  He's worse than the dentist in "The Marathon Man"!
RECEPTIONIST =>  Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Sutphin, but there's two police detectives here to see you...
DAD =>  What is it, officers? My patient is waiting.
DET. MOORE => Dr. Sutphing is your wife a big reader?
DAD => Bird books mostly...
DET. BRADFORD => Like these we found in her garbage?  "Urge To Kill".  "Mass Murder in Houston"?
DAD => I'm sure those are my son, Chip's books.
DET. MOORE => No, they're your wife's.  We checked,  She bought them down at "The Browse and Learn Bookshop" along with a few other titles...
DET. BRADFORD =>  "Helter Skelter", "Hunting Humans", Master Card reference number 7876. Dated June 5th.
DAD =>  THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!
DET. BRADFORD => Dr. Sutphin, is you wife mental?
MOM => Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
MISTY =>  Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
CUSTOMER => Just looking. 
MISTY => Thanks for not buying anything!
MOM => Misty, lighten up.  It's not the customer's fault Carl stood you up!
MRS. ACKERMAN =>  Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
VENDOR => Yes, ma'am, it is.
MRS. ACKERMAN => I'll give you fifty cents.
VENDOR => That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
MRS. ACKERMAN => Eight dollars?!  Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! 
MRS. ACKERMAN => I'll take this instead.
VENDOR => Nice one, huh?  Winter's coming. (Looking at price momentarily hesit'ating) Three dollars?...I guess that's what I marked it...
MOM =>  Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
MRS. ACKERMAN => I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
MOM =>  You want me to keep that under the table for you?
MRS. ACKERMAN => If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
SEXPOT DATE =>  Honey, pleeease?  For my little knick-knack shelf?
CARL =>  Wrap it up for the little lady.
BOY => I can't believe it!  Fuckin' Don Knotts!
GIRL =>  It's beyond ugly!
MISTY =>  There you go...
MOM =>  Misty, honey, look! (Holding up a set of cereal bowls) I made a killing!
MRS. ACKERMAN =>  I went back to get my Faberge Egg and some idiot bought it!
MOM =>  It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
MISTY =>  Watch the booth!  I'll be back! 
MRS. ACKERMAN =>  Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
MOM => Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
PERVERT => There was a lady in the men's room!  I swear! A pretty little lady in the stall right next to me!
MOM => That's one-hundred fifty-eight dollars.
DEALER => Will you take a New York check?
MOM => Certainly.
MISTY => Mother!  It's Carl! He's dead!
MOM => 0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
MISTY =>  Mother!  Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom!  I saw his dead body!
MOM =>  You got your wish.
MISTY =>  But...  I didn't wish...I didn't want him DEAD!
NEWS ANNOUNCER => ...Updating the top story of the hour, the young man brutally murdered a short time ago in the mens room of the Edmonson Flea Market has been identified as 22 year old Carl Padgett of Towson...
MISTY => Chip!  Our mother is Charles Manson!
MISTY =>   I'm not kidding.  Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
CHIP => MURDERED?!!
MISTY => Yes murdered!  You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too.  I don't know...maybe Mom's nuts!
CHIP => It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom!  Better yet, a TV series!
BIRDIE => Can I borrow your mother? My aunt is coming over to dinner tonight and she's always on my nerves.
KID => My step-father is an asshole! She could kill him!
CHIP =>  How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
MISTY => No!  Stop it!  It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
SCOTTY =>  I believe you, Misty. Your mother could kill - I've seen that look in her eyes!  Is there a reward or anything?
MOM => Dinner's served!
DAD => Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
MOM => Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
MRS. ACKERMAN => ...Dottie Hinkle was right - IT IS BEVERLY SUTPHIN!  I tell you I saw blood right on the bottom of her shoes!  Not exactly blood - it was GORE!  Hanging right there like a runny nose!!
DOTTIE => Nice as pie she was to me and then I hear her say it!
DET. BRADFORD => Say what, ma'am?
DOTTIE => "Are those..."  I can't say the word out loud.
DET. BRADFORD =>  Could you tell a policewoman the exact words she used?
DOTTIE =>  Maybe...
POLICEWOMAN => It's ok...nobody's gonna hurt you.  Come on, let it out...
DOTTIE =>  "PUSSY" she says to me! "PUSSY WILLOWS!"
CHIP =>  You know Mom, Scotty thinks you're the killer!
MOM =>  Does he?  For a boy who doesn't wear seat belts, Scotty's awfully nosy.  Excuse me a second. 
MISTY => She's gone!
MISTY =>  She's gonna kill Scotty!
DAD =>  BOTH OF YOU!  GET IN THE CAR!
CHIP =>  DAD!  YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
MISTY => I DO!  Mom's gone crazy!
DAD =>  Your mother may have some problems, that's all, Chip.  C'mon!  Hurry!
MOM => "...Ain't no time to grieve And it's Daybreak!!! Let it shine, shine, shine, All around the world!!"
ROOKIE => MAY DAY!! MAY DAY!!
DOTTIE => You rotten mother-fucker! You lousy cock-sucker!
MISTY =>  Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
CHIP =>  If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
DAD => We hope so, son.  And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
DET. MOORE =>  Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
, => and watches on video the ridiculous 70's trash film "Double-Agent '73" starring Chesty Morgan.
DET. BRADFORD. =>  Suspect's family is entering house.  Send backup to 2l14 Sycamore Street. I've got a feeling old Mom's inside.  I'm goin' in!
MRS. STERNER => What was that?
MR. STERNER => I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
MRS. STERNER => Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
MR. STERNER => What's he know?
MRS. STERNER => How to send a bill!!
MRS. STERNER =>  Ralph, "Wheel of Fortune"'s on!!
MRS. STERNER =>  Ralph, you're missing it!
MR. STERNER =>  What is it, Betty?
MRS. STERNER =>  We have mice!  I mean it, Ralph!  I saw one!
MOM =>  Always brush after every meal!
MR. STERNER =>  Betty?
MR. STERNER => Betty?  Betty, answer me!
MOM =>  "SHOUT IT OUT".
MOM => You'll pay for that, Ralph Sterner!!
MR. STERNER => Help!  POLICE!!
DAD => Home Sweet Home!  Everything's fine, kids!
MISTY =>  I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
CHIP => I'm disappointed she isn't!  For a while there, it was like being in a movie!
MOM =>  Anybody for dessert? M-m-m-m-m, strawberries!
DET. BRADFORD =>  ...Sutphin family proceeding west on Seminary Avenue.  Beverly ain't goin' nowhere this time.
MISTY =>  Dad, I thought it was ok. Make them go away.  This is embarrassing.
DAD => Just ignore the police. It's all a terrible mistake.
CHIP => Think we'll get on "A CURRENT AFFAIR"?
DET. MOORE => She's headed for church.
DET. BRADFORD =>  I say we nail her!
DISPATCHER =>  Negative.  D.A. says no bust until lab report is back matching suspect's fingerprints on true-crime book with those on scissors and fire poker.
DET. BRADFORD =>  She may be Beaver Cleaver's mother...but Jim Jones and the entire People's Temple just fucked her!
ANNOUNCER => ...the senseless killing last night of Towson couple, Ralph and Betty Sterner, brings to a total of four murders police feel may have been committed by Baltimore's first serial killer...
DAD => Beverly!  Not the Sterners!
MOM =>  It's a shame.  But they should brush their teeth, honey.
ANNOUNCER =>  This just came in.  Police Lieutenant Ronald Habbler has publicly named a suspect in the serial killer case and it's a shocker!  She, that's right, she has been identified as Beverly R. Sutphin of 2815 Calverton Court...
MISTY => Oh God!  Now I'll never get a boyfriend!
DAD =>  Beverly, I've been reading all about it...is it menopause?
MOM => Oh, honey!
CHIP => Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really!  Are you a serial killer?
MOM => Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
DAD =>  Don't worry, Beverly.  We're going to get you good psychiatric help.
REPORTER =>  So, Mrs. Sutphin!  Tell me! Are you "Serial Mom"?

MRS. JENSON =>  I don't feel like rewinding it!
CHIP =>  You see the sign!  It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
MRS. JENSON =>  Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
BIRDIE => What a bitch!

COURT TV => ...And you, ma'am, how long have you been waiting to get in?
LADY A =>  Since 5:00am.  But it's gonna be worth it!  I know she's guilty!
HUSBAND A =>  We've been to famous trials all over the country!
WIFE A =>  ..Manson.. .Watergate...  Didn't I see you at Hinkley?

MOM =>  Hi, honey!
MOM =>  Kids, did you do your homework?
JUDGE => Quiet in the courtroom! Court is now in session!
MOM =>  Hello, jury people. My name's Beverly Sutphin.  I like your jacket!
JUDGE =>  Mrs. Sutphin, I SAID QUIET! You are accused of mass murder! This is a court of law, not a coffee klatch!  Mr. Nazlerod, your opening statement.
MR. NAZLEROD => Thank you, your honor.  Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, my name is Timothy Nazlerod...  ...and I hope we can be friends! (JURY stares back impartially) ...I warn you, this is not a pretty case...Beverly Sutphin is a woman evil to the core... (JURY POV shot of innocent- looking MOM staring back at them) ...a rotten apple, if you will...  ...who beyond a reasonable doubt killed five innocent people!!
CHIP =>  Well...they sort of deserved it...
DAD =>  Shhhhh!
MR. NAZLEROD => ...THAT'S RIGHT!  SHE MURDERED THEM!...WITH A SPEEDING CAR... A FIRE POKER...
MR. NAZLEROD => ...A PAIR OF SCISSORS...
MR. NAZLEROD => ...A TOPPLED AIR CONDITIONER!
MR. NAZLEROD => ...THE LETHAL FLAMES FROM AN AEROSOL CAN...EVEN A LEG OF LAMB!!
MR. NAZLEROD => ...Beverly Sutphin is not a woman!...
MR. NAZLEROD => ...SHE IS A MONSTER!!
HERBIE HEBDEN => ...Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm Herbie Hebden and you and I have a tough job ahead of us...
HERBIE HEBDEN => ...I have known the Sutphin family for sixteen years...
HERBIE HEBDEN => ...Dad, Eugene, is my dentist...
HERBIE HEBDEN => ...Chip and Misty played with my own children...
HERBIE HEBDEN => ...but I've found out I don't know Beverly Sutphin at all!
HERBIE HEBDEN => ...No one really knows Beverly Sutphin...
HERBIE HEBDEN => ...You see...  ...Beverly Sutphin is INSANE!!
MOM =>  I AM NOT!
HERBIE HEBDEN =>  Yes, she committed these terrible crimes...  ...but that doesn't make her a bad person.
MOM =>  Your honor, I have a motion. I would like to fire my attorney, and defend myself!
HERBIE HEBDEN => Beverly Sutphin is not guilty, by reason of INSANITY!
MOM => Oh shut up, Herbie!  I have the right to defend myself, your honor.  I've read the lawbooks!  "Ware vs. State, 1964", and "Schutte vs. State, 1962".
JUDGE => Mrs. Sutphin, a defendant who has herself for a lawyer has a fool for a client...  Approach the bench!
JUDGE =>  Mrs. Sutphin, I have no legal choice but to allow you to take over as your own attorney.
HERBIE HEBDEN =>  You'll get my bill, I mean it!  A big one!
JUDGE =>  How do you plead?
MOM =>  NOT GUILTY, your honor!
MR. NAZLEROD =>  I call to the stand, Dottie Hinkle!
MR. NAZLEROD => Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
DOTTIE =>  I certainly did.
MR. NAZLEROD => Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
DOTTIE => Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
MR. NAZLEROD => Who's voice was it, Dottie?
DOTTIE =>  It was her!  Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
MOM => Mrs. Hinkle...do you drink?
DOTTIE =>  No, I don't.
MOM => So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
DOTTIE => I certainly was not!
MOM => You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's...the day you claim you recognized my voice...you weren't drinking?
DOTTIE =>  One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
MOM => So you do drink?
DOTTIE => Socially...I'll have a beer.
MOM => So you admit you just lied?
MR. NAZLEROD => Objection!  Argumentative!
DOTTIE =>  NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!
JUDGE => Sustained.  Watch your mouth, Mrs. Hinkle.
DOTTIE =>  Did you see her?!  She just said "Fuck you" to me!
MOM =>  Let the record show I'm just standing here.
DOTTIE => FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!
JUDGE => I'm warning you, Mrs. Hinkle. One more obscenity and I'll charge you with contempt of court.

DOTTIE => NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!

CHIP =>  Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
YOUNG MAN => Your mom killed my brother!
CHIP =>  That's cool...hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
YOUNG MAN => That's right.
CHIP => I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
YOUNG MAN =>  You mean for TV or print?
CHIP => TV, man!  Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
YOUNG MAN =>  Farrah Fawcett?!  Who's gonna play my brother?  Is Jason Priestly available?
MR. NAZLEROD => Miss Hodges, could you describe the car...the one you saw run over Mr. Stubbins in cold blood?
LU-ANN =>  I seen that movie!...On cable!
MR. NAZLEROD =>  PLEASE, Miss Hodges!
LU-ANN =>  'Scuse me...  ...Well, like I told you, it was blue.  The car, not the driver...  Just blue...you know...like blue!
MISTY => Get your "Serial Mom" T-shirts while they last! $19.95 plus tax!  Master Card or Visa!

DET. BRADFORD =>  In Beverly Sutphin's trash can.
MR. NAZLEROD =>  You may cross-examine, Mrs. Sutphin.

MR. NAZLEROD => Objection!  Immaterial!
JUDGE => You may answer.
DET. BRADFORD => .."Time"..."Newsweek".  My wife gets "Ladies Home Journal"...
MOM =>  Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
DET. BRADFORD =>  GODDAMN YOU!  THAT'S TRESPASSING!
MOM => Don't judge people by what they read, Detective.  Your witness, Mr. Nazierod.
DET BRADFORD =>  I'm a married man!!
DET. BRADFORD =>  I hope you get the gas chamber!
JUDGE => The jury is instructed to ignore the outburst of the witness.
MR. NAZLEROD =>  I call to the stand Rosemary Ackerman!
MR. NAZLEROD => ...and did you ever see the fire poker again after you left it with Mrs. Sutphin?
MRS. ACKERMAN => Yes!  Thirty minutes later it was covered with blood and gore and Carl Padgett was dead!
MR. NAZLEROD => No further questions.
MOM =>  Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
MRS. ACKERMAN => ...Browsing.
MOM => Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
MRS. ACKERMAN => I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
MOM => Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
MRS. ACKERMAN =>  NO!  I could never hurt anyone!
MOM =>  That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
MRS. ACKERMAN => Yes, but I lent it...
MOM =>  And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
MRS. ACKERMAN =>  Yes...but...I didn't...
MOM =>  Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
MRS. ACKERMAN =>  No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
HOUSEWIFE A =>  Could you sign it: "To a future Serial Mom"?
REPORTER =>  Sure.  You think she did it?
HOUSEWIFE B => I have reasonable doubt.
HOUSEWIFE C =>  I feel like killing a couple of people myself!
MR. NAZLEROD => Detective Moore, did you then proceed to the stage area inside "Hammerjacks"?
DET. MOORE => Yes, I did.  Scotty Barnhiil was on fire and he fell to his knees in flames.
MR. NAZLEROD => Would this be what you saw?
DET. MOORE => Yes, sir.  A real barbecue.
MR. NAZLEROD =>  Your honor!  May the photo be entered in as evidence and passed to the jury?
JUDGE => Huh?...oh yeah...YES.
DET. MOORE =>  Jeeeeze!  It really is Farrah Fawcett!
JUDGE =>  I loved you in "The Burning Bed"!
MR. NAZLEROD =>  No further questions!  I call to the stand, Marvin Pickles.
COP => MR. PICKLES!  MR. MARVIN PICKLES!
MARVIN => Be right out.
COP => The Judge is waiting for you!
MR. NAZLEROD => State your name, please.
MARVIN => Marvin A. Pickles.
MR. NAZLEROD => Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
MARVIN => Yes, I was.
MR. NAZLEROD => Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
MARVIN => I...um...  uh...
MR. NAZLEROD =>  Mr. Pickle!  Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
MARVIN => I...1'm not sure... (Really turned on, starting to moan) ...I...oohhh...Excuse me...
MR. NAZLEROD =>  What do you mean, you're not sure?!
MARVIN =>  There was nobody next to me:
MR. NAZLEROD =>  Mr. Pickles, you testified before the Grand Jury that you looked down and "saw a pair of lady's shoes" in the stall next to you.
MARVIN =>  Ohhhh!  I just said what you told me to!
MR. NAZLEROD => PERJURY IS A SERIOUS OFFENCE, MR. PICKLES!!
MARVZN => Ooohhhhhh!  I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
MR. NAZLEROD =>  You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
MOM =>  The prosecution has proven nothing, your honor.  The defense also rests!
FARRAH FAWCETT => ...I feel that Beverly Sutphin is an innocent woman, wrongly accused.  A normal housewife trapped in a nightmare of circumstantial evidence...
MR. NAZLEROD =>  ...That's her!  Henrietta Lee Lucas!  Joan Wayne Gacy!  A new face in the deck of serial killer trading cards... Find her guilty of all five counts of first degree murder...!
FARRAH FAWCETT => ...I only hope that I can portray "Serial Mom"'s life on the TV screen with the proper dignity that this feminist heroine deserves.
MOM =>  Look at me!  I'm a normal person just like you are!
MOM => ...But I've been framed by the police...
MOM => ...and perjured against by the very people I thought were my friends...
MOM => ...All I ask is that you have the courage to find me innocent of these terribly untrue charges...
FARRAH FAWCETT =>  ...All I ask is that you find me innocent of these terribly untrue charges...
JUDGE => Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, have you reached a verdict?
FOREMAN => Yes we have, your honor...
FOREMAN => ...We find the defendant not guilty of all charges.
MOM => I'm coming home!!
JUDGE =>  Court adjourned!
DAD =>  ...What should I do?
CHIP =>  Bring her home...I guess.
BIRDIE =>  No more violence...No more violence...
REPORTER BOYFRIEND => Think she'll like me?
MISTY =>  Just be nice to her.  And try ...just try not to get on her nerves.
MOM =>  I love you!  Thanks for coming!  Hi Los Angeles!  Hello Cleveland!  And you too, New York!
JUROR #8 =>  We did it!  We set her free! I knew she was innocent right from the beginning!...
MOM =>  You can't wear white shoes after Labor Day!
JUROR #8 =>  No...please...that's not true anymore.
MOM => Oh yes it is!  Didn't your mother ever tell you?!
MOM => Well, now you know!
JUROR #8 =>  But...fashion has changed...
MOM =>  No it hasn't!
DAD =>  Beverly?  Beverly?
MOM => Right here, honey.
PRESS => Mrs. Sutphin, can we get a shot with you and Farrah Fawcett?
MOM => Certainly.
FARRAH => Hello, Beverly.  I'm Farrah Fawcett  You stand here...  Ok, boys, a medium two shot...
MOM =>  ...but please...if I could just...
FARRAH =>  Stay there, Beverly.  Smile, Serial Mom!
MOM =>  THAT'S MY BAD SIDE, FARRAH FAWCETT!!
