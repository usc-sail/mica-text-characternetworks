But. => The wind starts to HOWL. QRAJ. And then... a BURST OF LIGHT through the opening of the teepee -- intense ULTRAVIOLET: FWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHss!!!
FLEEING PEOPLE. => Impossibly, the objects are STEEL MACHINES. BELLY VENTS snap open and DRILL CONES drop out -- jagged teeth CHURN TO LIFE -- faster -- FASTER -- as the drills begin CHEWING INTO THE GROUND. THE WOMAN -- staggering back in SHOCK and AWE -- clings to her baby for one final SCREAM and -- BLACK. Over which we read: C-- ... .-4_ s A N D A
beautiful. SMILING. => The Man stares: does he KNOW this woman? is this even HIS hat? The dog BARKS ALERT. The man turns -- QUICK -- his hand reaches toward his hip on INSTINCT but there's no holster. NO GUNS.
WES CLAIBORNE => Howdy.
LUKE CLAIBORNE => Maybe he's a dummy. Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now --
WES CLAIBORNE => There a reason you don't wanna answer my question, friend? And now, Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Man's wrist --
MOSE CLAIBORNE => Wes, he's got iron on his wrist... and he's been shot.
LUKE CLAIBORNE => Bet he's a chain jumper. Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Man's SURROUNDED.
LUKE => If he escaped, there'll be a bounty. Let's bring him with us. Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his back scabbard. COCKS both barrels. The dog GROWLS --
WES CLAIBORNE => Not your lucky day, Stranger -- turn round and start walking. But The Man doesn't move. The Claibornes share glances. Wes steps forward -- RAISING HIS RIFLE --
WES CLAIBORNE => Dead or alive, no difference. I said
WALK OR-- => THE MAN MOVES, A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE -- YANKS the rifle forward as BLAMI -- shot goes WILD -- suddenly the gun's in THE MAN'S HANDS -- BLAXI Wes is BLOWN backwards, HOLE IN HIS CHEST! As Hose draws his Enfield, The Man FLIPS the rifle again -- SLAM! MOSE FLIES OFF HIS SADDLE as The Man rolls -- UNDER Luke's horse -- GRABBING Luke's ankle -- suddenly Luke's FLAT on his back -- BREATHLESS, staring UP at the double-barrel:
LUKE CLAIBORNE => -- P-please, God -- d-don't -- -- The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK! The rifle's EMPTY. Luke's RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down, knocking him out cold. And ALL of this took about ten seconds. This man is a cold-blooded KILLER. But somehow... he didn't seem to KNOW that. CONFUSION. Drops the rifle, looks down at his hands... covered in BLOOD. And the BODIES in his wake. The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wes's jacket. It DANCES on the breeze -- flattens against The Stranger's foot. He picks it up, BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM --
Stay. => The dog sits by the door as The Man enters -- EMPTY -- he's moving -- into a small kitchen area -- bottle of whiskey -- uncorks it with his teeth -- drinks -- pours some on the wound -- then A PISTOL COCKS behind him -- Meet MEACHAM, town preacher, a tough, wash-foot Baptist:
MEACHAM => Palms to heaven, Friend. The Man freezes. Turns up his hands.
MEACHAM => Only two kinds of men get shot -- criminals and victims.  Which one're you?
don't know. => Meacham hears the HONESTY in his voice. Knows a lost soul when he sees one. Lowers his gun, softening...
MEACHAM => Got a name, son?
MEACHAM => What do you know?
MEACHAM => Odd wound. Looks... cauterized.  Means somethin' burned it half closed. The Man just stares. News to him. And now, as Meacham leans over the wound, the METAL CROSS around his neck begins to twitch... lifting ever so SLIGHTLX off his chest -- towards the strange BRACELET on the Man's wrist. Meacham reacts --
MEACHAM => Nice trick. That some kinds... magnet? The Man looks at him -- "What the hell is a 'magnet'?!?" Meacham shrugs it off, readies the needle --
MEACHAM => Try'n hold still. He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces slightly, but bears the pain.
MEACHAM => Where'd you ride in from?
MEACHAM => Seems I remember a story about that happening once... fella by the name of Lucifer.
MEACHAM => That blood yours or somebody else's?
up... =>  It's gone.
MEACHAM => Well. Too bad. Can't absolve you for your sins if you don't recall 'em. That bein' said... Meacham looks up, eyes twinkling. This is not a fire n' brimstone preacher. This is a guy who GETS IT --
MEACHAM => I seen bad men do good things and good men do bad things. Whether you end up in heaven or hell... it's not God's plan... it's yours.
MEACHAM => Dammit -- it's Dolarhyde's men! WHOOPS and HOLLERS and GUNSHOTS outside! The Man whirls to see A DOZEN MEN ON HORSEBACK, marauding through town --
NAT COLORADO => Percy! N2t the saloon!
PERCY => Why the goddamn hell not?!
NAT COLORADO => Cause your dady said so. Something LOADED in the way he emphasizes "daddy." Percy GLARES -- strange RESENTMENT between them. With a growl, Percy GALLOPS OFF, chucks the flaming bottle onto the CHURCH STEPS:
MEACHAM => You wanna help or are you just gonna stand there and burn?!
MEACHAM => All right, folks -- don't panic! Get inside and you'll be fine... C'mon... Meacham tosses The Man one of the blankets, nods across the street to the GENERAL STORE which is just STARTING to burn --
MEACHAM => Put it out before it gets goin'! ON THE MAN, not sure how he suddenly became the damn fire brigade, but HUSTLING across the street to --
KID => Just tryin' to save the candy.  You one of my Pa's hired guns? Before he can answer, HOOFBEATS behind them -- and here's PERCY. He yanks the reins, pulls his REVOLVER on our Man --
PERCY => Who the hell're yam? Whatever the opposite of Love At First Sight is, THIS is it:
THE MAN => Nobody.
PERCY => Nobody is right. You think you can just collect your fifty dollars and ride off? You signed up for the wrong side, boy. The kid's scared. The Man ISN'T, despite the gun in his face:
PERCY => Tell you what. You get down on your knees and kiss my boot. The Man's eyes narrow --
PERCY => You do that and I'll let you run back to wherever the hell you came from so you can tell whoever you see...  Absolution belongs -tg..th-e- 1Dolar es.
THE MAN => You want me to kiss your boot? Percy extends his boot just INCHES from The Man's face:
PERCY => Tongue's just fine if you're feelin' amorous. Don't hold ba -- THWIP! The Man YANKS Percy's boot off his foot in one quick move and KWHAM!!!1 WINGS IT RIGHT INTO PERCY'S FACE! Percy FLIES off the HORSE -- The Man grabbing his rifle -- the moment Percy lands, it's STICKING into his NECK:
THE MAN => Kiss this, you sonofa --
PERCY => Goddamnit, Nat -- SHOOT HIM!!! -- but The Man yanks Percy up by his collar, using him as a SHIELD between himself and Colorado. Eerily calm --
THE MAN => Wherever you came from? Go back. Colorado knows he's dealing with a PROFESSIONAL. MORE GANG MEMBERS ride up, surprised -- a dirty outlaw, GREAVEY, barks:
GREAVEY => Sheriff's right behind us, Nat!
PERCY => You goddamned shitheels! Don't you even THINK about leavin' me!!!! Colorado -- DECISION -- doesn't take long -- glares at The Man --
NAT COLORADO => Be seeing you.
THE MAN => Look forward to it. With that, Nat spurs his horse -- YA! The others follow him as he RIDES HARD out of town. Percy growls at The Man --
PERCY => You are a dead man. You hear me? So help me God I will kill you my-- DM! The Man's SMASHES Percy's skull with the gun, knocking him OUT COLD, as LAWMEN approach on horseback --
KID => FA! He caught Percy Dolarhyde! SHERIFF KYLE TAGGART rears up on his horse. Tall, dark and handsome despite a SADNESS in his eyes, already dismounting:
SHERIFF TAGGART => Emmett -- you all right? The Kid  strides towards his father excitedly:
YOU-SHOULDA-SEEN-IT-HE-TOSSED-PERCY-L IKE- => a-f lap jack- then-stared-down-Nat-Colorado- like-he-wasn't-even-scared!!!! Taggart turns to The Man now, cautious, but grateful --
SHERIFF TAGGART => Pardon my boy, mister. He can be excitable.  Kyle Taggart. The Man shakes Taggart's hand. A beat. Then --
SHERIFF TAGGART => Well I'm in your debt, Luke. Tune of fifty dollars, actually.  Our advert? The telegram? The Man NODS -- Oh, RIGHT.
SHERIFF TAGGART => Could use a man like you in case any of 'em come back...
SHERIFF TAGGART => Fair enough. You don't mind spending the night, bank opens in the morning... I'll get you your money then.  Saloon's got rooms. You just tell Maria I sent you. The Man tips his hat, nods to Emmett , turns to go. Taggart furrows his brow as the DOG scampers after him.
SHERIFF TAGGART => You here with the prospector woman? The Man stops. Intrigued. Turns back --
SHERIFF TAGGART => Yup. Real looker. Came into town yesterday with that there dog. She a friend of yours?
Maybe. => And as The Man heads off, we HOLD ON TAGGART, his spidey-sense tingling that all is not RIGHT with this...
DEPUTY WADE => Somethin' wrong, Kyle?
SHERIFF TAGGART => What's that French sayin' where you swear you seen someone before?
DEPUTY WADE => Don't speak French.
SHERIFF TAGGART => No... you sure's hell don't. Taggart takes one last look at The Man departing as we CUT TO:
ROY CLANTON => I don't give a damn what he don't like -- gotta sit here and babysit a damn herd of cattle. Dolarhyde ain't gonna do squat. (rises; grabs his
CROTCH) => Gotta see a man about a buffalo... He lets out a big BURP and stumbles off behind a ridge. More THUNDER. Something doesn't feel right. A sudden WHOOSH and --
DOC => -- I know you are, don't lie to me!
MARIA => How many times do we have to do this, Arturo? J. love you.
DOC => Really? Do you?!?  I found this in our bed! And I don't k3 Vg. a watch, Maria. I can't AfjQrd a watch because y insisted we buy this saloon! She looks at him SQUARELY -- yes, some SECRET withheld. As The Man In Black reaches the bar, he's Maria's EXCUSE to end this:
MARIA => We have customers. And MOVES off. Doc stomps toward the exit -- sees EMMETT at the back of the bar stealing sips of BEER from left-behind glasses:
ATTICUS => That mutt makes a move for my steak, I'll drill him down.
MARIA => Shut up, Atticus. This is the man who took out Percy Dolarhyde. Atticus grumbles and goes back to eating, but not before sweeping his duster aside to show the GUN in his holster. Maria rolls her eyes, sets a GLASS in front of The Man, who nods:
MARIA => What kind?
This kind. => He removes the PHOTO from inside his hat. The one of the WOMAN.
MARIA => Never seen her before. But she is beautiful. (pours him whiskey; then one for herself) Here's to you finding her, Senor. ON THE MAN. Not exactly sure he WANTS to. But they CLINK glasses, knock 'em back. Maria pours him another:
MARIA => You have any idea what kind of mess you just stepped into?
MARIA => It's not the boy you should worry about.
DOLARHYDE => Name's Woodrow Dolarhyde. I'm what you might call, the Tall Hog at the trough.
DOLARHYDE => You're Roy, right? Clanton, is it? Been working for me two weeks now, and I haven't had the pleasure. Our POV belongs to ROY CLANTON, the ranch hand from the cow abductions. TERRIFIED -- his arms and legs TIED TO THE SADDLES OF TWO HORSES, kicking dirt in front of Dolarhyde's RANCH HOUSE:
CLANTON => Mr. Dolarhyde, I... I swear I didn't
STEAL YOUR-- => -- a VIOLENT "SSST" from Dolarhyde JOSTLES the horses -- STRETCHING Roy tight enough to SNAP -- he SCREAMS --
DOLARHYDE => Best not to interrupt me, Roy, makes the horses skittish.
LISTEN CLOSE => He pulls out a WHIP, gripping it by its STERLING SILVER HANDLE. Starts CIRCLING the horses as he lets the whip UNFURL:
DOLARHYDE => Following the War Of Northern Aggression -- what some ironically refer to as the "Civil" War -- came a prodigious nation- wide market for beef. Cowtowns sprang up all along these prairies, Roy; populated by enterprising young drovers -- among 'em, my daddy, Jeremiah Dolarhyde. Sold six of his gold teeth and a sword gifted to him by Robert E. Lee for twenty of the scrawniest Longhorns you ever saw -- then turned 'em into the fattest herd West of the Chisholm Trail.  Watched him work this lash, driving those steer til his fingers bled... but what good's a whip without a herd, Roy? And slowly, torturously, SWEEPS the whip tip in the dirt...
ROY CLANTON => Mr. Dolarhyde, Sir, you gotta believe me -- I went to take a piss and and -- saw a light in the sky -- blue -- and when I ran back the cows and fellas were gone!
DOLARHYDE => The sky. Opened up. And took my cows. Incoming HOOFBEATS -- Dolarhyde looks up to see COLORADO and the rest of the GANG returning from Absolution. A WOMAN emerges from the servant's quarters. APACHE. 50's. Beautiful. As the men REAR, Nat Colorado MEETS EYES with her. A relationship we don't understand yet as Dolar strides up --
DOLARHYDE => Where's Percy?
NAT COLORADO => Jail. Sheriff locked him up. Dolar darkens. Unsheathes a KNIFE. Looks down at Roy:
DOLARHYDE => When're these people gonna lgarn? He STABS the knife down... SLICING the rope tethered to Roy's FEET. His lower body SLUMPS to the ground, he breathes a SIGH:
THANK Y-- => Dolar SLAPS the horse's rump, to which Roy's UPPER TORSO is tied; it GALLOPS off, dragging a SCREAMING ROY into the night.
DOLARHYDE => Everyone saddle up. Got us a sheriff to kill. As he MOVES OFF, Dolarhyde's eyes go to the Apache Woman. Something passes between them. She seems CONCERNED.
NAT COLORADO => Wasn't the sheriff, got him caught. It was a stranger. That STOPS Dolarhyde. He turns back, face dark:
DOLARHYDE => ... What stranger?
NAT COLORADO => Usually a man gives off a scent. Where he's been. What he's done.
SHERIFF TAGGART => Tomorrow we ride the little shit up Phoenix way, turn him over. Dolarhyde's got a beef, he can take it up with the 6th cavalry. Taggart's on his feet, grabs his JACKET off the door --
SHERIFF TAGGART => Goddamn tired of this... fatass rancher scaring good people off their lan-- He STOPS. Something catches his eye on the posting board. YANKS a piece of paper off, a mixture of CONFUSION and CONCERN
SHERIFF TAGGART => Sonofabitch. WHAT DOES HE SEE? Before we get a chance to KNOW --
MARIA => You drink like a man who wants to forget.
ATTICUS => You got three seconds to get your dog outta here or I blow his balls off.
ATTICUS => Q=... two... -- and just before "three"... CA-CLICK. Atticus FREEZES, because there's a RIFLE BARREL at the back of h,iS head now:
VOICE => Give you odds you don't get to 'three.' RACK TO FIND the person holding the rifle is A WOMAN. Beautiful. EXOTIC. Dressed in leather. Meet ELLA SWENSON. ON THE MAN IN BLACK. Can't help himself. immediate and undeniable CHEMISTRY. But she pays him no mind -- makes a PSST sound and the dog snaps to her side. Atticus uncocks his gun, slowly slides it back in the holster --
ATTICUS => I was just havin' some fun, Miss --
ELLA => Give- him, the steak. Atticus HESITATES, angry at the humiliation. Ella PRESSES THE GUN HARDER against his neck, lowering him -- and his plate -- to the floor. Right in front of the dog, who GROWLS --
ELLA => Now say you're sorry.
ATTICUS =>  I'm-- sorry.
ELLA => His name's 'Happy.' HappyBARES HIS TEETH. INCHES from Atticus' face
ATTICUS => I'm sorry... 'Happy.'
ELLA => Alright then.  You're right. That was fun.
ELLA => What're you doing with my dog?
ELLA => The hell're you talking ab--? WRIST BRACELET. Surprise and REVELATION:
ELLA => Where... did you get that? Before he can answer, SHERIFF TAGGART enters, along with DEPUTY WADE , and 5 other deputies. They move cautiously to THE MAN, like he's a powder keg about to go off...
SHERIFF TAGGART => Hey there, "Luke." Mind following me down to the office so we can have us a chat...?
SHERIFF TAGGART => All due respect, I'm the law, mister. That's what for. The men LOCK EYES:
SHERIFF TAGGART => Because we did meet. ON ELLA. For reasons we're not sure of, the idea of The Man leaving ALARMS her. All the Gunslingers' hands are POISED by holsters. The Man stays preternaturally COOL:
SHERIFF TAGGART => And what's gonna happen?
SHERIFF TAGGART => Now why'd you have to go and say that? Taggart gives a nod and the men start to CONVERGE --
SHERIFF TAGGART => Yup -- looks just like him.
SHERIFF TAGGART => "Jake Lonergan. Scourge a' The Territories. Wanted Dead or Alive." And The Man... now forever known as JAKE... stares WOOZILY into his OVERTURNED HAT... the photo tucked inside of the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN... her image goes BLURRY... then mil{:
PERCY => You're a dead. Jake sits up. Woozy. Blinking back to reality.
PERCY => My daddy's comin' for me, Boy. You're gonna end up another dead shitheel under his spurs. I am gonna watch you suffer for a long, long -- Jake moves LIGHTNING QUICK -- reaching through the bars, GRABBING PERCY'S COLLAR, YANKING FORWARDS -- SLAMMING Percy's head into the bars, KNOCKING hIM OUT COLD AGAIN. Percy DROPS.
JAKE => Shut up. Jake sits back on his cot, rubbing his still-throbbing head.
ELLA => I need to see Lonergan. It's important.
DEPUTY WADE => 'Fraid not, Miss -- we're preppin' him for transport. And pushes PAST her, into the office with the men. HOLD on Ella -- dammit, she NEEDS to find a way in there.
SHERIFF TAGGART => What happened to him?
SHERIFF TAGGART => Step back against the wall there. Move and I shoot you dead.
JAKE =>  You should've let me go.
SHERIFF TAGGART => Yeah, I should've shot you in your knee. You put down six of my deputies.
JAKE => Six was all you had.
SHERIFF TAGGART => Hell, they're gonna love you in Phoenix.
JAKE => Yeah? What's in Phoenix?
SHERIFF TAGGART => What you got comin', Jake Lonergan. Taggart reaches into his shirt, pulls out a pair of GLASSES. Slips them on his nose. Takes out that WANTED poster and reads:
SHERIFF TAGGART => Aggravated banditry, 17 counts, Forgery, Blackmail, Hijacking, injurious use of a cattle prod, Arson, Incitement of Whorehouse Riot, and Trespassing with intent to deflower. You're also leader of a gang of outlaws includin' Creek Johnson and Bull McCade, which makes you accessory to every law they broke too.
JAKE =>  That it?
SHERIFF TAGGART => Saved the best for last... 'Murder.' That LANDS on Jake. Wondering if this is TRUE. Evenly --
JAKE => It say who I killed?
SHERIFF TAGGART => Prostitute outta Mojave, name of Alice Wills. Taggart rises, removes Jake's BLACK STETSON from a hook on the wall, pulls that PHOTOGRAPH OF THE WOMAN from the inner brim:
SHERIFF TAGGART => If I were a bettin' man, I'd say this would be Ms. Wills, would it not? Jake just stares, CONFUSED. SHAKEN.
SHERIFF TAGGART => They found her dead in a cabin round Saguaro Pass, twenty miles west of here. With that, a CLUE falls into place: SAGUARO PASS.
SHERIFF TAGGART => Deed was in your name. He slips the photo back in the brim, tosses the hat to Jake:
SHERIFF TAGGART => Dead hooker with a hole in her chest, in your cabin, plus your sterling reputation equals guilty as goddamned sin.  And you're gonna hang for it. At gunpoint, Taggart PUSHES Jake out the door --
GREAVEY => blue light... Clanton said he saw blue light before the cows disappeared...
DOLARHYDE => Just a storm.
COLORADO => No storm I've ever seen... I say we wait 'til it passes. But Dolar isn't listening. THROUGH HIS BINOCULARS: he sees PERCY being carried into the prison wagon. Followed by Jake.
DOLARHYDE => No time, they put him in an iron coach. With a HYA! he's OFF, the others FOLLOWING with reluctant looks -- still SPOOKED by that incoming STORM:
DEPUTY WADE => Gimme your wrist. Jake holds out his hands. Wade unlocks one wrist, freeing a cuff... then takes that cuff and LOCKS IT to Percy's wrist.
JAKE => What're you --?
CHARLIE => Best way to make a man stay put: chain him to his enemy.
EMMETT => You sure he's a bad guy, Pa? He did give Percy a lickin'.
SHERIFF TAGGART => He's bad enough.
EMMETT =>  . can I come with you?
SHERIFF TAGGART => Too dangerous.
EMMETT => Dangerous to drive a damn coach? Why can't Charlie just take him?
SHERIFF TAGGART => Because it's my job, Emmett. That's what these people pay me to do. And your mother would kill me if I brought you. Emmett looks off, half sad, half angry --
EMMETT => Good thing she's already dead then. And turns without a goodbye. Taggart watches him leave, wishing he could connect. Takes the reins and looks up -- REACTS: THAT MASSIVE. FRIGHTENING CLOUD IN THE SKY -- roiling faster toward town. The scary BLUE FLASHES within grow more INTENSE. IN THE COACH -- WITH JAKE, looking at the BRACELET, the pulsing growing MORE FREQUENT -- and then, a VOICE:
HEY! => Jake turns to see ELLA, pushed up against the coach window:
ELLA => Tell me where you got that bracelet...
JAKE => Maybe you should'a asked before you knocked me out..
ELLA => Please... I need to know. Just tell me where you got it.
JAKE => Y dOli' .xBmbgX - - I don' t remember my name or where I've been or any of the things they said I done, so leave me the hell alone. And sits back as the coach starts to MOVE, leaving Ella in the dust. Some of the gunmen ride atop it; others on horseback cover the coach in a protective ring. Wade sees something incoming from the NORTH:
KYLE!!! => Taggart looks up: Dolarhyde's gang racing down the mountain --
DAMNIT -- => He unslings his SHOTGUN as his men ready their weapons -- ON DOLARHYDE'S GANG, riding hard, guns ready too -- This is about to get UGLY. BUT... from the OTHER end of town, the WIND picks up -- As the massive storm cloud seems shockingly to have STORED AT A H -- its EYE churning, ROARING and... TWO BOLTS OF BLUE LIGHTNING CRACK DOWN FROM IT! Happy starts BARKING MADLY. Ella sees the lightning and starts to BACK AWAY in fear:
ELLA => NonoNO -- GET TO YOUR CELLARS! EVERYONE
UNDERGROUND NAT! => But her cries are LOST as -- RRRRRRRR!!!!!
MEACHAM => Jesus God!! STRANGE STEEL RINGS fire from the speeders and mushroom out -- KA-CHING! -- SNAP OPEN and CLAMP around necks, arms, legs -- and from these steel collars, CABLES LASH OUT, whip-snapping back to the speeders and TETHERING MAGNETICALLY to them --
EMMETT ! => Emmett runs into his dad's embrace --
PA!! => -- a STEEL CABLE fires from the collar, SNAPS TAUT as it connects to a speeder and WHOOSH! Taggart's RIPPED off his feet, dragged away -- ELLA tackles the boy as ANOTHER RING zooms overhead, locks around a FLEEING WOMAN -- she's TAKEN --
BIRDCAGE THEATER! => With a "C'MON!!!" she rushes him through the FRENZIED CROWD --
DOLARHYDE => Colorado! Nat Colorado RACES IN as Dolar draws his .45 -- BANG! -- shatters the coach lock -- they PULL Percy out:
AYUDAMEEEEEEE! => Doc LEAPS after her but her collar's LASSO CABLE whips out, TETHERING to a passing Speeder and she's RIPPED OUT THE DOOR --
ELLA => Everyone inside! GO GO GO!! Ushering Emmett and TOWNSFOLK underground, PULLS the door SHUT --
DOC => Maria -- oh God-- they t-took her-- What just...? MOANS, WAILS... desperate cries as people search for loved ones. JAKE'S BLASTER -- RETRACTS, folding in on itself -- shrinks down to size, reverting back into a BRACELET. He's stunned. So are the remaining townsfolk. DOLARHYDE is first to speak:
DOLARHYDE => Who the hell're ?
NAT COLORADO => He's the one who caged Percy. Dolarhyde starts MOVING toward Jake -- wild killer eyes --
DOLARHYDE => Whatwere__tho_se__thinae?
JAKE => -- why're you asking m&?! Dolarhyde GRIPS Jake's arm -- THE BRACELET:
DOLARHYDE => This! Where'd you get this?! It was shooting the same light beams they were --
JAKE => Let go of my wrist.
DOLARHYDE => -- I'm not lettin' go of nothin' til you tell me what the he-- KA-LLLANG!! Suddenly that CHURCH BELL comes HURTLING out of the church wreckage, PLOWS through debris. People scatter. And out of the church stumbles... AN ALIEN. 8 FT. TALL. Standing upright, limbs inverted -- limbs that DRAG, wounded, as people SCREAM and RUN and Jake and Dolarhyde can only stare, jaws dropped, and the monster LUNGES: WHUPWHUP -- something SPINNING through the air -- A HATCHET ---
EMMETT => Is it... dead? Jake KICKS the alien. It doesn't move. Happy BARKS --
DOLARHYDE => . The hell j,,a it?
MEACHAM => A demon. They all turn to see MEACHAM. TERRIFIED.
MEACHAM => Revelations 16:14: "For there are spirits of demons, showing signs."  Escaped from hell itself.
EMMETT => Lookit its wrist! It's got one'a those bracelet things too! Indeed, there on the creature's wrist is an IDENTICAL BRACELET. ON JAKE. Mind tumbling. He meets eyes with ELLA. Her face as EAGER as his to understand this and now... BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. What's that SOUND? Everyone looks at each other. Colorado bends closer to the corpse... SCARED...
NAT COLORADO => I think... it's comin' from somewhere inside it. People look at each other: WHAT NOW? Trying to control the near- hysteria they all feel. Finally, Dolarhyde takes a BREATH -- more BRAVADO than actual courage:
DOLARHYDE => Only one way to find out. We need to cut it open.
DOC => . Are you... serious? 
DOLARHYDE => Wake u Those things took your wife --
DOLARHYDE => Well this one here's our only chance of findin' where they went. That LANDS on all of them. A long beat. Doc looks down at the thing, ORANGE GOO dribbling around the AXE in its head...
DOLLARHYDE => So you got a bone saw or don't you?
DOC => Stay outside. You're not welcome in here! Dolar brings up his COLT -- so does COLORADO --
DOLARRYDE => I own more of this town than any man in it so I'll go wherever the hell I damn please. And for the record? You ain't welcome in my country, Mexican. Ella steps between them, BAD ASS --
ELLA => Whatever troubles you had don't mean a damn thing against the ones we got now. We wanna see our way through 'em, your guns better start pointing in the same direction, Goddammit. Doc and Dolar never take eyes off each other. or their GUNS. Finally... Dolar LOWERS his. So does Doc. People BREATHE. Meacham slips on a pair of GLASSES, studying eerie veins and muscles through the creature's viscous outer layers. Doc turns his focus to the alien too. Picks up his PUMP-OPERATED BONE SAW. Presses his boot on the bellows, it turns with a WHIR... SHAKING as he brings the SPINNING BLADE to the alien's CHEST. Looks at Meacham, AFRAID --
DOC => If it 'mss a demon, and I cut it open... am I going to burn for it?
MEACHAM => That should cover ya. ON DOC. Little relief. BROW SWEATING, he brings the spinning blade down toward the disgusting ALIEN -- VRRRRZZ -- HESITATES --
DOC => Excuse me. B GH! He PUKES on the ground.
EMMETT => Jesus, Doc!!! Doc wipes his mouth with a handkerchief, slightly DEFIANT --
DOC => This is not normal. I'm entitled to vomit. We should XU be vomiting.
DOLARHYDE => Just cut, Lardass. Doc GLARES... with a still-shakitig hand, gets back to business --
DOC => Senor? A hand?
EMMETT => Damn! Smells like a dead dog's ass.
MEACHAM => Emmett.
EMMETT => Sorry, Father. Doc covers his face with his handkerchief as he explores...
DOC => Chet wall's partially collapsed... no familiar organs of any kind...
DOLARHYDE => 'course they're not familiar. Just look at this th--
DOC => Spinal reflex. And GRINS at Dolar's pain. But Meacham NOTICES something around Dolar's neck where the alien pinned him, like a ring of DUST:
MEACHAM => Something on your neck. Hold still. Meacham sweeps a little off Dolar's neck, rubs it between thumb and forefinger. The dust GLINTS under the kerosene lamp:
MEACHAM => I'll be damned... gold. They check the creature's hand talons: GOLD FLAKES underneath 'em, and Lots of it. Colorado checks its taloned feet:
NAT COLORADO => Down here too.  This much ore... could only have come from a digging in a mine. That LANDS on everyone. but most especially ELLA. Who looks up to see Jake READING her in this moment.
EMMETT => In the ALIEN'S EYE is a SMALL FLASHING LIGHT. On/Off/On/Off in time with that BEEP BEEP BEEP.
DOC => Gimme my scalpel. In MACRO CU, DOC CUTS INTO THE EYE, WET SQUISHY SOUNDS as he pulls it from its socket, attached to a STRINGY OPTIC NERVE dripping with juice. Clamped to the nerve is a METALLIC ORB: -- he takes hold of the blinking orb. It FLARES to life, the light coalescing into a 3-D ARROW-LIKE HOLOGRAM. Confusion. Doc REMOVES it from the optic nerve and the hologram DISAPPEARS:
DOLARHYDE => Where'd it go? The hell'd you do?
DOC => Nothing, just pulled it off -- He reconnects it to the optic nerve, the hologram REAPPEARS:
DOC => Only works when it's touching the creature. Colorado moves closer... rainbow light flickering across his face...
NAT COLORADO => I think... it's a compass. Look:  No matter how you move it, it points in the same direction.
EMMETT => Compasses point north. That's west.
MEACHAM =>  West's where 141 came from. ON JAKE. Another puzzle piece falling into place.
EMMETT => If you're right, what's it pointing to?
ELLA => The rest of 'em.
DOLARHYDE => Then that's where I'm goin'. He SNAPS his PISTOL open, loading bullets:
DOLARHYDE => One of my ranchers said my herd disappeared into the sky. 'Til about ten minutes ago, I figured him for a liar.  Nobody takes my cattle.
MEACHAM => Your b was taken too. A FLASH of something from Dolarhyde -- could that be EMOTION? But just as fast, it's GONE. Almost a THROWAWAY:
DOLARHYDE => I noticed.
NAT COLORADO => What if they're already dead?
EMMETT => They're not dead.
ELLA => Kid's right. If all they wanted was to kill us, they would've.
DOLARHYDE => Looked to me like... they were ropin' people.
DOC => If she's alive -- if there's even a
MEACHAM => Lord hates a coward... but our bullets were useless against those things. Other than his wrist gizmo, we're outgunned and outnumbered. As one by one, they turn... to JAKE. Who until this point has been mostly SILENT. Observing. But now -- he's gone from enemy to potential savior in a heartbeat.
JAKE => Whoa, I got nothing to do with this --
ELLA => You got everything to do with it. If you can remember where you got that thing --
JAKE => I remember you all wantin' me on the end of a damned rope. Whatever's happenin' here's got nothin' to do with me.
ELLA => You sure. about that? He LOOKS at her. No, he isn't. But he sure as hell won't stay to debate it -- turns to go --
EMMETT => Mr. Lonergan? Sir? The EMOTION in the boy's voice STOPS Jake at the door.
EMMETT => My mother died last year. My Paw... he's all I got.
JAKE => Kid, I'm the last man you want anywhere near you, your Pa... or anyone else in this goddamned town. OUT the door. Everyone trades looks, then Ella FOLLOWS:
ELLA => That's it? You're just gonna run away?
JAKE => No, Sister. I'm walking away.
ELLA => Well s w. As he keeps on walking, Ella picks up a ROCK, wings it at the back of his HEAD -- WHAMI Jake stumbles forward, TURNS AROUND --
JAKE ELLA => SONOVA-- -- I told you to gyp. Ella strides forward, picking up another rock on the move --
JAKE => What's your damn problem?!
ELLA => You're comin' with us.
JAKE => I'm not coming anywhere. And you throw that rock I swear I'll-- WHAM! The rock glances off his shoulder --
ELLA => If you're walkin' away from here, what the hell're you walking tsQ? That PENETRATES as Jake realizes he doesn't really KNOW. And that's the last thing he's gonna admit --
JAKE => What the hell are you walkin' to, Lady? 'Cause if I heard right, it sounds like suicide to me. -- now it's her turn to pause. Cryptically:
ELLA => I... just wanna help these people.
JAKE => Bullshit. You wanna help yourself. Saw your face light up the minute you knew that thing might lead you to gold. And the fact that he's BUSTED her gets Ella's hackles up --
ELLA => It's not gold I want, you dumb sonofabitch, it's what it'll buy me.
JAKE => And what's that?
ELLA => Remange. Whatever that means, it's a deep, painful LONGING in her. She stares at him, DEAD ON:
ELLA => And lookin' at you? I'd bet a silver dollar... its what you want, too. With that, Ella turns and STRIDES OFF as we HOLD ON JAKE, face knotted in conflict. As her words RESONATE.
MEACHAM => Was the Devil come to Absolution... come to drag our town down to hell... SERIES OF SHOTS - AS DUSK TAI .t $. TQ .NIGItT: Though BURNING EMBERS, Emmett helps a LITTLE GIRL pull her half- burnt DOLL from the rubble...
MEACHAM => but our town's not just a buncha buildings, Brothers and Sisters -- Nossir. Our town is fie. Good, God- fearing souls. Pure and hopeful. And the devil can't never take that away... Ella and Doc tend to WOUNDED PEOPLE in a triage area as... Meacham finds his overturned PULPIT. Determination in his eyes, he pushes it UPRIGHT:
MEACHAM => In times of darkness, God asks that we come together so we may stand and fight. So we're goin' after our kin. Any of you aren't able or prepared, no shame in it. Head up to Fort Huachuca, join up with the garrison there and pray... Rest of us ride out at sun-up to recover that which we have lost. SUNRISE: Pistol chambers SPINNNN -- rifles are COCKED --
MEACHAM => Thy will be done, Lord, and there's an amen behind it. Lo and behold, most of the town survivors are just too damn scared. They form an EXODUS LINE, heading off toward the fort. Dolarhyde, Colorado and his REMAINING MEN  load the ALIEN CORPSE onto the back of a WAGON. Some of them trade glances -- DAMN WORRIED about staying. Dolarhyde sees it:
DOLARHYDE => Somebody got something to say? His withering GLARE keeps them from speaking up. Doc and Meacham climb onto the wagon:
DOC => If this arrow points me back to Maria? Yeah -- J'm sure. Emmett appears leading a PONY, a BOW and quiver of ARROWS slung around his back:
MEACHAM => Can't come, Emmett, too dangerous.
EMMETT => I can protect myself -- shoot, I'm the only master bowman in my archery club. Won the county tournament by shootin' a flipped nickel at 50 paces.
MEACHAM => Somethin' tells me these things don't carry nickels, son. Answers's no.
EMMETT => You want me to ride off with the chickenshits, then double back, be happy to. But let's just skip that part and get to it, Padre. And that's the truth. Meacham sighs, no choice... finally:
MEACHAM => Go fill your canteen, dammit. He SLAPS the reins and the wagon rides off. Emmett GRINS and mounts the pony, then sees... JAKE riding past. ANGRY EYES from Ella as she heels her horse and TROTS OFF angrily:
ELLA => C'mon, Happy. But HAPPY remains, torn between them, tail wagging and looking up at Jake as if to say: PLEASE COME?
JAKE => Oh shut up. Suppressing GUILT, he rides on toward the hills -- as Dolarhyde VEERS his horse in front of Jake, cutting him off:
DOLARHYDE => I was ridin' into town to kill you for what you done to my son. You owe me your life, Boy.
JAKE => You that fast?
FAST ENOU-- => -- WHOOSH: Jake's hand is already UP with his own PISTOL, having drawn before Dolarhyde can finish his sentence:
JAKE => Now you owe me y.Q= life. We're square. In a DAZZLING TWIRL, Jake slaps it back in his holster. Point made, he RIDES ON. Dolarhyde, burning mad at having been out- drawn, turns to CULOBAI)U -- speaks LOW:
DOLARHYDE => Follow him. Soon as he's got his back turned... kill him.
MEACHAM => Figure out which way you're headed yet?
JAKE => West. Saguaro Pass.
MEACHAM => That's not what I meant. The inference LANDS on Jake. But he's in no mood. GALLOPS off. Meacham watches Jake go... MUSIC RISES AS WE DISSOLVE THROUGH:
THE WOMAN => You shouldn't have. She turns, drops the flowers into the vase as we see she's talking to JAKE.
JAKE => Got you somethin' else.
THE WOMAN => Where'd you get this?
JAKE => Where do you think? The woman looks to the pouch -- Picks up one of the coins. TORN. Jake moves behind her. Close. An INTIMACY here.
THE WOMAN => Your boys '11 come after you. ON JAKE. Dark. But DETERMINED:
JAKE => Let 'em come. She turns to him, their eyes HOLD... and they KISS. Soft. Tender. Soulful. But then -- a THUNDERCRACK turns their attention to the window: A STORM CLOUD on the horizon. Same kind that consumed the town. The cabin starts to VIBRATE like a tuning fork. The pouch slides off the table... THE GOLD COINS SPILL OUT and --
THE WOMAN => What's happening?!!!
BLASTER -- => JAKE DIVES AWAY but a searing pulse RIPS A WICKED GASH in his side  --
JAKE => Alice! As he RUSHES to her, her collar UNLOCKS... and FLIES AT JAKE, clamping HE'S PULLED INTO THE LIGHT, CHOKING, SCREAMING --
JAKE =>  "Alice"... Whoever she was to him, he feels sledgehammered with GRIEF. All he knows is, it was THEM. The creatures killed her. And this revelation... well, it galvanizes him with RAGE. Rage that gives him NEW PURPOSE... then--
GREAVEY => So... what's a pretty lady like y--
ELLA => -- you finish that sentence, I shoot you in your beef whistle. Doc, sipping from his canteen, does a SPIT TAKE. Ella's eyes DRILL Greavey. Cut down a peg, he tips his hat, red-faced:
GREAVEY => Ma'am. And rides past her, taking us to EMMETT and DOLARHYDE:
DOLARHYDE => Tell me somethin', Kid... why didn't your father just take my money?
UOLARHY DE => offered him a thousand dollars to leave town. He could's taken you outta harm's way, relocated... found you a new momma. And this just BURNS Emmett. A beat; then:
EMMETT => Is it true Percy's momma died givin' birth to him, Mister Dolarhyde? Something FLASHES in Dolarhyde. But he's contained:
DOLARHYDE => Yeah.
EMMETT => Then maybe you should use that thousand dollars to buy yourself a new wife. Emmett HOLDS his look against Dolarhyde's. Brave and UNFLINCHING. Doc can't help but grin at the kid's moxie... but it's short-lived as his face suddenly falls:
DOC => Madre Dios... And we PAN AROUND, dropping over his shoulder to see what he's reacting to -- AN ENORMOUS CRATER. ACRES WIDE... TWENTY FEET DEEP. Even Dolarhyde looks nervous now:
DOLARYHYDE => What the... hell is it?
MEACHAM => It was Winfield's Landing. They turn to see Meacham, brushing the DUST off a WOODEN SIGN: Holds it UP. " Winfield's Landing... Population 133." ON GREAVEY AND THE MEN. Shit. He doesn't mean...?
GREAVEY => You tryin' to tell me those... things pulled the whole damn town into the sky? And suddenly a weird CRACK shakes the canyon -- like the SOUND BARRIER BREAKING -- everyone's look goes UP where: SWIRLING, DARK CLOUDS LOOM. The same clouds that dropped the tornado on Absolution. And that appeared in Jake's MEMORIES at the cabin. But this time, something's SHOT OUT from them --
MEACHAM => That can't be good. The plummeting object HITS a distant dune, kicking up a SAND
DOLARHYDE => Scatter.
DOC => Should we... open it?
DOLARHYDE => Should we open it? Hell NO we shouldn--
EMMETT => -- oops -- -- and now we find Emmett's already POKING it with a stick, a Small TEAR in the cocoon's outer embryonic layer -- GOO leaks -- then it RUPTURES, EXPLODING as the horses REAR away, WHINNYING the goo spreads across the desert floor, thinning out. BEAT. Everyone wipes blue shit off their clothes as they come FACE-TO-FACE with the object inside, lying there on the ground:
GREAVEY => Boss... it's one'a yours. Dolarhyde's eyes NARROW. Emmett looks at Doc, SCARED:
EMMETT => Is-- is this what happened to my Pa? Doc dismounts. Moves to the cow's mouth and PULLS OUT THAT TUBE with a wet SQUISHING sound. Thinking it through:
DOC => This was stuck down its throat... to help it breathe. That means they wanted to keep it alive, Emmett.  I'm sure your father is fine. But Doc's eyes aren't sure. Meacham looks back to the sky:
MEACHAM => Why'd they dump it?
ELLA => Whatever they needed from it, they must've got.
EMMETT => Ho-ly shit. BOOM UP to reveal a SURREAL SIGHT in the valley below: AGAMBLING RIVERBOAT. Nose buried in the sand, paddlewheels facing the sky, as if it'd been dropped from the clouds into the desert. Just like that cow. Off their LOOKS --
DOC => "Colorado Queen."
ELLA => Son of a bitch. IT'S JAKE ON HORSEBACK. Followed by another horse, with COLORADO in the saddle. Wrists tied but ALIVE. As Jake rides to a stop, he PUSHES Colorado off the horse -- the indian HITS the ground with a THUD as Jake levels Dolarhyde with HARD EYES:
JAKE => Your man got it in his head that he was s'posed to kill me. I'm holding onto his ear 'til he says sorry.
DOLARHYDE => Why'd you let him live? Jake's hard-as-nails. DRIVEN now --
JAKE => Gonna need him. He rides past Dolar to Ella. Stops. Says, simply:
JAKE => Nice boat.  What's that smell?
ELLA => That'd be me. He realizes her shirt's caked in the BLUE GOO from the cow.
JAKE => Why're you blue?
DOLARHYDE => We better keep movin'. A THUNDERCRACK. On the horizon, sheets of RAIN.
JAKE => Storm's comin'. I say we dig in here til it passes. (to Colorado; fucking
WITH HIM) => How's that sound, Nat? Nat BURNS. Dolar feels his AUTHORITY being undermined:
DOLARHYDE => Storm or no storm, I say we keep movin'. Colorado finally turns to Uolarhyde. DEFIANT:
NAT COLORADO => Too hard tracking anything in the rain.
DOLARHYDE => You okay?
COLORADO =>  Yeah. Dolar pours some whiskey on a BANDANA, leans towards Colorado --
DOLARHYDE COLORADO => Lemme clean it for you or it'll get -- -- I'm fine. Dolarhyde backs away. Colorado GLARES.
DOLARHYDE => Say it.
COLORADO =>  Is Percy worth dyin' for? Dolar's eyes flash. A mixture of anger and PAIN. Then --
DOLARHYDE => He's my son.
DOLARHYDE => Hey. Kid. Emmett looks up, SNIFFLES. Dolar tosses him the WHISKEY FLASK:
DOLARHYDE => Take a drink and shut p. He gets up, walks off. Leaving the kid with the flask. As Emmett looks at it confusedly, stuffs it in his POCKET --
DOC =>  We brought enough water.
MEACHAM => Not for drinkin', it's for blessin'. Doc nods: ah. Turns to go... STOPS. Turns back. Intense eyes:
DOC => Padre... Maria came to see you in confession every Sunday. It seemed... she had a lot to talk about.  Was she having an affair? Meacham removes his spectacles. Looks at Doc --
MEACHAM => You know I can't say. And Doc DOES know. But there's a quiet DESPERATION here --
DOC => The last thing I said to her... I...  Please. If I'm wrong about my wife... I don't want to die angry. Meacham sees the PAIN in his friend's eyes.
MEACHAM => You can ask Maria if she was cheatin' on you once we get her back. 'Til then?  Don't die.
JAKE => You missed a spot.
ELLA => The hell,-re- you doing here?
JAKE => Mindin' my own business.  Then you decided to take a shower.
ELLA => Why didn't you say anything?
JAKE => Givin' you privacy. She throws her shirt on, but her skin's wet and the shirt glues to her, celebrating her shape in a way that can't be ignored. Jake tosses her his jacket. As she slips it on, she notices a bottle of WHISKEY on the table... and the PHOTOGRAPH OF ALICE.
ELLA => . she's pretty.  Who was she? Jake's quiet. DARK. Intense emotion, intensely suppressed:
JAKE => only thing I know's her name was Alice...
ELLA => Maybe you loved her. Jake shakes his head, sort of mumble/chuckles in RESISTANCE:
JAKE => All you women are the same -- Always wanna make it about Goddamn "love."
JAKE => Don't matter. She takes a step closer. Soft. Intimate.
ELLA => So what dj= matter? Jake just looks at her. Then, lifts the cheroot to his lips, the FLARE of its tip casting him in a demonic light...
JAKE => What matters is I find the thing that killed her.  And make it pay. And now, he leans forward with a focused LOOK... holds up his
JAKE => Where'd you see this before? A beat. Ella -- somehow CONTAINED -- opens her mouth to lie. But he cuts her off --
JAKE => -- and don't lie to me. You wouldn't've asked me if you didn't recognize it. Ella tightens. PAIN in her eyes. And Jake REALIZES:
JAKE => Those things... they the ones who put those marks on your back? She swallows: a mixture of SHAME that he's found her out... and ANGER at what was done to her.
ELLA => They took my people. Destroyed where I'm from.
JAKE => Where's that?
ELLA => North of here. Been trackin' 'em ever since, town to town. Best I figure, they're hidin' in a mine. Jake CONSIDERS all this. Softens a little:
JAKE => Maybe if you'd told me the truth instead of throwin' rocks at me --
ELLA => -- what, you would've stuck around? Bullshit. I couldn't've turned you away from what you had to do, any more than I could've stopped these people from going after their kin.
JAKE => So that's the only reason you wanted me to come with you? Cause of my gun? There's a pause... then Ella SMIRKS back:
ELLA => No, not your gun.
GREAVEY => What the hell're we doin' here? We should be ridin' in the opposite direction of those things --
COBBETT => We do that, the old man's likely to shoot us himself. Only way outta this is -- And suddenly. Greavey SNIFFS the air, FROWNS:
GREAVEY => . what's that smell? -- as they TURN to the deck where the creature lays... ALL THEY
AW SH-- => LIGHTNING FLASHES, illuminating the ship -- and als4THE ALIEN behind them. a coiled mass clinging spiderlike to the ceiling!!! Its arm WHIPS out, noosing around Cobbett -- LIFTS HIM off his feet -- SLAMS HIM into the ceiling -- TOSSES HIM like a ragdoll: The men SHOUT -- a PAIR OF RAZOR SHARP CANINES extrude from the alien then it SPRINGS -- SLICING THROUGH TWO MEN AT ONCE -- GREAVEY and 2 others manage to SCRAMBLE AWAY:
DOLARHYDE => Get behind me, Boy -- THE ALIEN SPRINGS INTO THE ROOM -- landing upside down on the ceiling. Dolar FIRES at it --
GODDAMMITT!!! => And the fire's GROWING around the boat --
JAKE => Don't know if you understand me... but you hurt that boy and I hurt you.
HELL, DEMON! => Meacham brings his CANTEEN down like a HATCHET, SPRAYING the alien with HOLY WATER... but NOTHING happens! And then -- The Alien STRIKES -- SLAMMING MEACHAM BACK INTO A JUTTING PIECE
JAKE => Easy, now... Don't move, dammit --
MEACHAM => Go after the boy... then you get our people back...
JAKE => Stop talking. DQW! GET YOUR ASS-- But Meacham GRABS Jake, EYE TO EYE. GASPING:
MEACHAM => Listen up... 'cause I'm not gonna be able to say it again --  God don't care who you were, Son... only who you Mg. ON JAKE. AFFECTED. With a last RASP, Meacham DIES just as DOC races through the growing FLAMES -- REACTS -- no time to mourn --
NAT COLORADO => That thing... was dead... it was d-ead... DOLARHYDE, RAIN pouring down his face... VULNERABLE and GUILTY:
DOLARHYDE => I couldn't stop it -- It just... grabbed the kid. ON JAKE. Rage-filled against the flames... Meacham's CRUCIFIX in his hared, as his FIST closes around it. Looks up, HARDCORE:
JAKE => Then we'd better get him back.
EMMETT => Damn. You are one ugly bastar-- PSST! The alien spits a RESIN GOB on Emmett's mouth -- PSST PSST! More gobs PIN his limbs to the wall. Emmett can't move -- can't speak -- eyes WIDE and TERRIFIED -- The creature looks down at an ARMOR PLATE on its bicep. Touches a series of keys and the armor spits out what looks like... .. a small RUBIK'S CUBE made of some alien alloy. The creature casually TOSSES IT in the air where it FLOATS and starts to SPIN -- as it does, its sides FLIP AND TURN (like a Rubik's Cube) -- emitting HIGH-PITCHED SONAR BEEPS: This thing's some kind of HOMING BEACON. Off Emmett's WIDE, GAPING EYES...
NAT COLORADO =>  West. Greavey and the others share a LOOK. E o Turn to Dolar --
GREAVEY => Boss, only took one of them things to kill four of us. We got no chance here. Dolarhyde BURNS -- knowing he's being ABANDONED --
DOLARHYDE => You're a goddamn coward.  You work for me, dammit. You're my m e 1 1 Qyees. And Greavey, finally FREE to speak his mind, says SPITEFULLY:
GREAVEY => Fine line between a coward and a fool. The men turn tail and RIDE AWAY. Dolarhyde SHOUTS after them --
DOLARHYDE => You're all FIRED! Doc takes the opportunity to TWIST the knife:
DOC => Looks like they finally found something to be more scared of than you. Dolarhyde feels his world CRUMBLING away man by man... Ella trots alongside Jake, who's staring at that DARK CLOUD MASS overhead with a bad feeling:
JAKE => Clouds've been moving east since sun- up... 'cept that one. ON ELLA. We SENSE she knows something, something more she isn't saying. SNAPS her reins and they RIDE OFF:
SOMETHING'S WRON-- => BLAMBLAN1111 GUNSHOTS from above suddenly PEPPER the ground -- the horses REAR and KICK UP, startled -- A DOZEN FIGURES ON THE CLIFFS ALL AROUND THEM. Badass OUTLAWS with RIFLES aimed at our heroes. One of them CALLS DOWN:
SHIT. => SLOWLY, Jake draws his gun... tosses it. Now the rest of them. As they SEE -- TWO RIDERS -- incoming -- from the other end of the canyon. Rifles aimed and ready. Happy GROWLS... One of the outlaws knocks back the hammer on his rifle --
OUTLAW => I say we just shoot 'em and take their-- But the words catch in his throat as his EYES WIDEN:
OUTLAW => . Boss? Sure enough, they're looking right at (BRONC -JAKE. Both outlaws and HUNT) lower their guns, hostility replaced by SURPRISE:
HUNT => What the hell you doin' back here, Lonergan? Oh, Christ. This is JAKE'S gang. ON DOLARHYDE. ELLA. COLORADO. All registering it. And JAKE, of course, doesn't REMEMBER these men as Bronc dismounts, NERVOUS:
BRONC => Jesus, Boss... Creek's gonna shit when he sees you.  And who the hell're they? ON JAKE. Now does he handle this? Ht:nt rides up next to him, SUSPICIOUS, and for reasons yet to be known, UNFRIENDLY --
HUNT => What's the matter, Jake. Cat got your--? SMACKI Jake moves LIGHTNING FAST, SLAPS Hunt across the face, stopping the question on his tongue -- CATCHES the gun as it drops and presses the barrel into Hunt's NECK:
JAKE => Since when're Qy the one asking the goddamned questions!?! Ella and our people REACT as Jake plays it up, beat defense a good OFFENSE. The outlaws are SCARED: this is the Lonergan they know. Hunt holds his BLOODY MOUTH:
HUNT => Christ, Jake... You broke my tooth
JAKE => Quit whining. Now bring me to the rest of the boys, if that meets with your goddamn approval. Bronc and Hunt nod, mounting up, SHOUTING to the OUTLAWS above:
DOLARHYDE => Nice company you keep.
ELLA => What the hell're you doing? If we don't catch up to that kid, we're never gonna--
JAKE => They called me "Boss." You wanna go after these things with five or fifty?  Like you said: we can use every gun we can get. Qh. That actually makes SENSE. But --
ELLA => What exactly're you gonna say to 'em?
DOLARHYDE'S FLASK => Tumbles from Emmett's pocket and SPLASHES WHISKEY on The Slaver -- IT.. S[iRIEM WILDLI-Aa THE BOOZE CONTACTS FLESH, SKIN SMOKING! EMMETT -- tumbles away. Terror turns to REVELATION as he PULLS the webbing from his mouth:
EMMETT => Holy SHIT. Another alien LUNGES for the kid but Emmett SPLASHES him with the flask -- the alien RECOILS, flesh BUBBLING -- Emmett whirls -- sees the HOVERBIKES -- JUMPS onto one, twisting desperately at the controls --- IiON-DO , 'T THIS TURNS,__ WO ?!! Another Alien SCUTTLES in FAST -- Emmett's scrambling boots slide into the foot supports, which automatically WHIR CLOSED as the bike THROTTLES FORWARD... DECAPITATING THE ALIEN! The bike SPINS UNCONTROLLABLY, plasma thrusters SCORCHING WALLS and setting two more aliens ABLAZE! The speeder KAMIKAZE BOUNCES out of the cavern at 90 MPH, Emmett screaming! The Slaver SCREECHES FURIOUSLY as the remaining creatures LEAP back on their speeders and GIVE CHASE!
CREEK JOHNSON => Hey --- s 4 Lay off that whiskey and saddle up. Flyer's on its way and we best damn be sober for it.
HUNT => Creek turns; sees HUNT and BRONC crest the hill with the other OUTLAWS from the cliffs. ANGRILY:
CREEK JOHNSON => 'Bout time you got back.  What the hell happened to you?!? Hunt nods over his shoulder --
HUNT => He did. The outlaws part to reveal JAKE, riding in with Ella and the rest of our people. Creek's eyes NARROW, NOT happy to see him:
CREEK JOHNSON => well, shit. It gets very, VERY QUIET. Our people tread warily, knowing whatever reaction Jake's eliciting, it AIN'T GOOD. He runs the gaunt of ACCUSING GLARES. Smart enough to know that CREEK is the man in charge. Dismounts:
JAKE => You don't look happy to see me, Creek. Creek eyes him. TOUGH. Clearly, HISTORY here:
CREEK JOHNSON => We're fixin' to rob us a train in about twenty minutes and you come ridin' in like nothin' ever happened?
JAKE => Well I'm sure you'll get over it. Then, pretty much DISMISSING Creek, Jake turns, addresses the rest of the men. If he's their boss? H _gQDn&. CT LIR .T
JAKE => Nice to see you, Boys, but we're not going after a train -- We're going after something else. The men seem... . CONFUSED. Not sure what the hell is GOING ON.
BRONC => But Jake... you-- you said you didn't wanna be in charge no more. And this is a REVELATION. Jake glances at ELLA -- has to keep IMPROVISING to hold his ground:
JAKE => Well, I-- changed my mind. So saddle the hell up.
CREEK JOHNSON => They're not going anywhere with you. Creek's heard enough. Strides forward, a direct CHALLENGE:
CREEK JOHNSON => You got some balls on you -- walkin' outta here a week ago sayin' what you said and doin' what you did and then ridin' back in here and givin orders. Just who the hell do you think you are? The IRONY of the question isn't lost on Jake, as Creek walks right up to Ella. CLOSE. Violates her space: studies her with a mixture of curiosity and CONTEMPT.
CREEK JOHNSON => So. Are you her?
ELLA => Am I who?
CREEK JOHNSON => The whore Jake quit this gang for. OH. Another piece of the puzzle falls into place -- Jake's eyes SNAP to Ella as they both REALIZE... the men think she's " e." Jake does his best to stay cool, meets Creek's stare:
JAKE => Watch your mouth, Creek.
CREEK JOHNSON => Or what? These boys are with = now. jID in charge. You may be fast, but you are goddamned outgunned. ON JAKE. OUR HEROES. Shit. Jake turns to the men --
JAKE => That a fact, Boys? But Creek doesn't wait for them to respond:
CREEK JOHNSON => Put your guns on the whore. He so much as twitches, blow her brains out her ear. AT ONCE, 10 GUNS ARE LEVELED AT ELLA'S HEAD. No doubt as to who the men are LOYAL to. But Jake locks into Creek, UNFLINCHING:
JAKE => Call her a whore again, that'll be the last word you ever say.
CREEK JOHNSON => You ain't in no position to make threats, asshole. Hunt: take his gun. Hunt reluctantly scrambles over to Jake, oh-so-carefully pulls the PISTOL from Jake's holster:
HUNT => Sorry, Boss... nothin' personal. Creek now turns to BULL MCCADE, roughly the size of a BARN.
CREEK JOHNSON => Put him down, Bull. And Jake barely has time to react as Bull lets fly with a JAWBREAKING HAYMAKER that about knocks Jake out of his BOOTSI Dolarhyde and Colorado WINCE as Jake hits the dirt with a THUD -- Creek striding over, cock of the walk, LEANS over him:
CREEK JOHNSON => Where the hell's our gold. Jake? "Gold?" Jake SPITS BLOOD, defiant:
JAKE => Don't remember. Creek NODS to Bull: SMASH! Another devastating BLOW. ON ELLA -- at GUNPOINT. Wishing she could intervene. DOC too.
CREEK JOHNSON => Well I _dg remember you tellin' us you was leavin' us high and dry because you were in love... You just left out the part about taking half our goddamned haul from the Yuma Bank. So I'm gonna ask you one last time -- Where. Is. Our. Gold? -- WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake so hard he FLIES OFF HIS FEET:
CREEK JOHNSON => Man can't run away from who he ja, Lonergan... you really think you could go straight just cause you were fool enough to fall in love with some woman? WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake back into oblivion, and on the HIT we: MEMORY FLASECUTi PEACEFUL SILENCE -- two FACES staring at each other across a pillow -- Jake and ALICE, naked, in a WHOREHOUSE
ALICE => You sure you wanna give it all up? ON JAKE. Clearly TORN. But just as clearly, in LOVE.
JAKE => What about you? Once we're gone, you ain't ever comin' back. She touches his face so gently. And whispers:
ALICE => You're the first person ever believed I was better than this place... so I gotta believe in y=.  You're a good man, Jake Lonergan. PRESENT: as the words "Good Man" ECHO back to Jake. Stir=g_ ]11n as Creek GRABS Jake's hair and YANKS BACK, rears up a fist:
CREEK JOHNSON => You figgered you could steal from us? All that gold was yours to take co you could go off and start a new life? Creek's next PUNCH takes us to another: TORY FLASECUTI REPLAY -- Jake and Alice in the cabin -- he drops the SADDLEBAG -- it CLINKS to the floor. She's worried:
ALICE => Your boys'ii come after you.
JAKE =>  Let 'em come. BACK TO PRESENT -- as now Jake UNDERSTANDS the context of this moment -- what they were saying to each other -- He looks up at Creek, BEATEN AND BUSTED UP:
JAKE => Okay... okay, I remember now...  Demons stole your gold, Creek. But when you get to hell, you can ask for it back.
JAKE => Told you not to call her that. ON JAKE. Pure KILLER. As he turns his weapon on the rest of the  gang -- through BLOODY TEETH:
JAKE => You're all riding with me. Any one of you decides otherwise? So help me God, I'll kill you where you stand.
DOC => Dios mio.
DOLARHYDE =>  Jesus... it's the kid. As Emmett ROARS IN, the shocked outlaws SCATTER:
DRAGGED AWAY! => Those who have their wits about them FIRE BACK, trying to hit the flying machines. CROSSFIRE. CONFUSION.
THE SLAVER => His speeder GROWLS to a halt. Dismounting like a killer biker. ON JAKE. As he SEES that horrible alien face across the crowd: QUICK BIT: Alice dying in his arms. And this same damn THING is the one responsible for it. And we're: BACK TO PRESENT. Jake's eyes LOCKED on the SLAVER as he says:
JAKE => You.
ANOTHER ALIEN => Hurls a boomerang-like "SMART WEAPON." It circles past the GATLING COWBOYS, BACK into the alien's hand as:
LET'S GO!!! => Our people ESCAPE for the horses. Doc climbs up on the WAGON buckboard and pulls EMMETT in the seat beside him -- As ELLA leaps on a horse --
THE SLAVER => Climbs back on his speeder and GUNS FOR HER, firing a STEEL COLLAR -- Jake turns -- SEES THIS. Starts RUNNING MADLY:
PINKERTON #1 => You hear.that?
PINKERTON #2 => How many times I gotta tell you, Leonard. No one'd be stupid enough to rob this tr--
PINKERTON #2 => 1 stand corrected. They DRAW GUNS, running to see what's happening and --
JAKE'S POV => Through a slot between boxcars, the speeder BLURS in the opposite direction. Up ahead comes the CABOOSE. No more TRAIN: Thinking FAST, Jake LEAPS off his horse -- CATCHES A LADDER RUNG ON THE CABOOSE'. Teeth gritted, starts to CLIMB up onto:
JAKE => Ella...? Her head just falls back. Yeah. Hard to swallow, but it's true. ELLA'S DEAD. And if this moment ECHOES Jake holding his dead wife, well that's just fine. He stares beseechingly as... HOOFBEATS. The rest of our people gallop in: Colorado, Dolarhyde, Doc and Emmett in the wagon:
EMMETT => Aw no... is she --? Jake looks up -- unhinged --
NAT COLORADO => We need to get out of here NOT.
NAT COLORADO => Nobody move. Jake and Emmett freeze. The Apaches are ALL AROUND THEM. Fierce. BOWS and TOMAHAWKS drawn -- OFF THIS:
JAKE => I remember now.
JAKE => She was like you. Seemed to think I was a good man. (finally, voice almost
CRACKS) => But I couldn't save either of you. A beat... his bound hands gently touch her face...
JAKE => Where's the good in that? His eyes CLOSE. Too much.
JAKE => I'm sorry, Ella. And that sits... then suddenly -- JARRINGLY -- THREE MORE BRAVES roughly enter, pull Jake up, FORCE HIM out:
EMMETT => Wasn't your fault, Mr. Lonergan. Those things... were lookin' for her. Had a picture and everything. That breaks the spell. Jake looks over --
JAKE => What d'you mean... 'a picture'?
EMMETT => Floatin', like that arrow thing we found in its eye. Before Jake can makes sense of this, a teepee smoke flap OPENS and out steps the tribe's SACHEM. This is GREY WOLF -- dark, wrinkled face enhanced by TATTOOS. He takes one look at his prisoners and SPEAKS A FEW WORDS OF APACHE.
DOC => What'd he say?
COLORADO => "Kill them. And make it quick." Doc is amply freaked. Turns to Jake as FIVE OF THE BRAVES move for them, MENACING --
DOC => Now'd be a good time to use your gun bracelet, my friend. But Jake is VACANT. BROKEN. All the fight seems GONE from him. His bracelet DOESN'T MOVE. Dolarhyde's grabbed first... PULLED FORWARD by one of the braves, raising his TOMAHAWK -- they're really gonna KILL HIM --
GREY WOLF => How is it that you speak our language?
UOLARHYUE => Because I'm a damn genius. Grey Wolf's fascinated this man has the audacity to be a WISEASS given his circumstances. Turns to the Brave with the tomahawk --
GREY WOLF => Forget about quick. Make him feel it. The Brave NODS, RAISES the Tomahawk again, but Dolar interrupts:
DOLARHYDE => Two hundred head of cattle! Grey Wolf holds up his hand, halting the Brave's death blow --
DOLARHYDE => I'll have two hundred head of cattle u_a here in a day's time if you let me go. ON GREY WOLF. Considering this.
GREY WOLF => And how do I know you'll come back? Dolarhyde nods to Colorado --
DOLARHYDE => You can keep my associate here. if I don ' t come back, you can kill him. Colorado REACTS. He's the only one here who knows what the hell these two are saying to each other as Grey Wolf approaches Dolar, looks right INTO HIM --
GREY WOLF => Why should I believe that you even care about this man? Dolarhyde's eyes flash EMOTION. Quickly bottled. Then:
DOLARHYDE => Because he's my son. Wow. Didn't see that one coming. Grey Wolf levels Colorado with those unyielding eyes --
GREY WOLF => Is this true? And Colorado answers in ENGLISH, for the benefit of the others:
COLORADO => Yeah... he's my father. REACTIONS. JAKE. EMMETT. DOC. Stunned silence. And so:
GREY WOLF => Three hundred head. Dolar looks to Colorado, who won't meet his eyes. His FATHER's eyes. Turns back to Grey Wolf, HARD --
DOLARHYDE => Two fifty. HOLD ON GREY WOLF for a beat. Then --
GREY WOLF => Cut him loose. The Brave does exactly that. Dolar's FREE to go...
EMMETT => Hey! What about =?!? ON DOLAR. A FLASH of regret. But it's gone fast.
DOLARHYDE => What about you, kid? And he just walks out of the camp, leaving his son behind... GONE. And now, it's back to business --
GREY WOLF => Kill all of them except the half-breed. Our people are GRABBED. Jake's yanked forward, PINNED DOWN -- a Brave raises a HATCHET to kill Jake, who glares back with lunatic eyes. Ready to die. Almost wanting it:
JAKE => What're you waiting for, asshole? DO IT. And as Jake's about to MEET HIS DEATH:
ELLA => . what... happened? ON JAKE. Holy. SHIT. Everyone else equally STUNNED.
EMMETT => You... died.
ELLA => If I'd told you on the boat, you never would'a trusted me -- -- but he takes a step BACK. If he's relieved she's alive, he isn't showing it:
JAKE => Did you hear what I said?
ELLA => .. What?
JAKE => When you were playin' possum. Did you hear what I mid? He's angry. Yes, even embarrassed. And because of it, something has SHUT DOWN in him again. That killer look is back.
ELLA => No. I was mendin'.
JAKE => How's it you look like one of us?
ELLA => I can look like whatever I want to.
JAKE => So you can't die?
ELLA => Sure I can. If my heart stops beating... just like you.
.JAKE => You're nothin' like me, Ella. You're one'a them. we can see that hurt her. But she deserved it, too. So desperately wants to reach him...
ELLA => I'm not, Jake. I'm from a different place. He isn't sure what that means. Can he even trust her? Either way, she has ANSWER;. Darkly:
JAKE => The one that took you.
ELLA => They call him The Slaver. He's the one, gave me the scars. Broke me. And made me watch... while he killed my family too. Even with his guard up... Jake can't help but be STRUCK. As the sound of HOWLING WIND takes us to:
ELLA => For every drop of light in the sky, there's another world. Filled with life...
ELLA => Our race was first to map the stars... that's why they came for us. Took our planet, piece by piece. Slaughtered anyone who fought hack. Ones who survived were turned into slaves. Trackers. She says this meeting the eyes of GREY WOLF. There's immediate SIMPATICO here: a story the Indians could be telling.
ELLA => They brought me aboard one of their scout ships -- a ship with only one purpose: to find other planets like mine. Planets they can take... people they can enslave. As the terrible gravity of all this HITS everyone, JAKE is first to understand...
JAKE => X lead 'em here. Ella swallows. Wracked with GUILT.
EMMETT => Well damn, lady, thanks a 1.
ELLA => I never wanted this.  But they got... ways. Of making you do things. Her eyes are HAUNTED with memory. The inference is some kind of TORTURE. She pushes it away -- staying strong:
ELLA => Been tryin' to make it right... tried to blow the ship to hell by burnin' up all their fuel, then escaped down here.
JAKE => Where is it. Jake's determined -- he's got his OWN agenda. Ella looks up to that OMINOUS CLOUD. Those BLUE LIGHT FLASHES ripple within:
ELLA => Hiding in that cloud. Way I figure, they'll find enough fuel to leave by tomorrow, midday. Then they'll bring back the others.
DOC => "others"?
ELLA => The whole fleet. They'll take what they need. Everyone on this planet. Anything too weak to survive... they'll toss. Like that cow. Tomorrow. Midday. Hi noon. This is bad, bad news.
NAT COLORADO => What'd you mean, they're looking for "fuel"...? And before Ella can answer, Jake already GETS IT:
JAKE => Gold. That's why they're in a mine.
ELLA =>  . wherever it is, that's where you escaped from -- and it's the only way back up to the ship.
JAKE => I-- I blasted my way out... MEMORY FLASHCUTI REPLAY POV as we RUN through the cavern -- ESCAPE -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits us as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see:
JAKE => I remember seeing a tower... made of stone... on the rim of a canyon... Upon hearing that, Grey Wolf suddenly speaks in animated gestures, pointing North. Colorado REACTS:
ELLA => What? What's he sayin'?!? Colorado turns to Jake, a flicker of HOPE:
COLORADO => That rock you're talkin' about... he- knows where it is.
SHERIFF TAGGART => You... all right...? DRIFTING over to see MARIA. Gravity PULLING her hair downward. Groggy. Mostly SCARED:
KYLE!!!! => ANOTHER METAL TENTACLE slithers in and GRABS WADE -- swinging our men across the cavern where we reveal... . the tentacles are attached to a TERRIFYING ALIEN MACHINE. Taggart and Wade are PINNED DOWN on what looks like an operating table. As they thrash, RESTRAINING CLAMPS enfold their skulls. An OCULAR PROBE looms _Q.Xpr. them, This is the image _ e.'_A_beM1_ seeing! This is what haRpened to him before he escaRe ! WORKER-BEE ALIENS adjusts the device over their eyes -- INSTANT X-RAYS read their retinas -- HYPNOTIC -- as the men grow DOCILE and LIMP despite their fight and -- FLASHFLASHTLASHI The probe has ERASED THEIR MINDS. Catatonic stares. Now the machine arms slip the men into separate TRANSLUCENT CAPSULES. METAL BREATHING TUBES are implanted down their throats as the capsules begin to fill with a THICK, BLUE LIQUID. This is the same blue goo -- a protective gel -- that housed the COW in that jettisoned cocoon in the desert. More Worker Bees load the cocoons into TRANSPORT SHUTTLECRAFTS. We see containment holds filled with BLEATING COWS and REARING HORSES... all going through a similar cocooning process. All of this is overseen by THE SLAVER, who stalks up a ramp behind the cocoons. The craft HUMS to life, undergear retracting as it ROARS OFF down the tunnel...
NAT COLORADO => This is Kiowa land, their sister tribe. As they near the bluff, Jake sees the STONE TOWER. Dismounts:
JAKE => That's it. As they near the bluff, they hear the growing sound of that MACHINERY. Everyone dips low, peering over to see...
DOC => Holy Jesus. Like a damn fort. Grey Wolf looks to his men, GRAVE, CRESTFALLEN as he realizes:
GREY WOLF => The Kiowa... they were taken too. Suddenly, the ROOF of the steel structure blossoms open like a CHROME LOTUS... and WHOOSH! The SHUTTLE TRANSPORT flies out of the canyon, RISING into the dawn sky...
ELLA => Transports. Way they get people and gold back and forth to the ship.
DOC => Place is crawling with those things. We'll never even get close. Grey Wolf SPEAKS --
NAT COLORADO => He says there's a back way in... The Twin Rivers run underneath this whole canyon. Limestone tunnels up by the falls, couple miles East. Lead right down there. Jake looks to the SKY. DARK. DETERMINED.
JAKE => The Slaver... he's up in that big cloud? Ella nods, HARD. Off their SHARED DETERMINATION, our SCORE rises. A DRUM CADENCE that suggests a MISSION starting to form:
DOC => Just so I got this straight... three of those things just kicked the shit out of your entire gang, took our whole town, and now you two're gonna ride right into that fort, try to hijack one'a those-- He pauses on the word --
ELLA => "Transports."
DOC => -- ride it up to that space boat --
ELLA => Spaceshp.
DOC => Then bring it down here and get everybody off alive? That's your big plan? Jake and Ella share a LOOK. Simply:
JAKE => Yup.
DOC => And just how do you figure on getting in there in the first place?
JAKE => Poke a hornet's nest... they swarm at'cha.
ELLA => You gotta draw 'em out. Buy us a distraction. A long beat of incredulous, do-you-believe-this-shit STARES:
DOC => You want us to storm that fort? Against those things? With less than fifty men? It's suicide.
EMMETT => It ain't, it's been done! I read at school how Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys took Fort Ticonderoga, they weren't but a small garrison and they were outgunned --
ELLA => We need all of you to make a stand. Together. It's the only way.
NAT COLORADO => Make a stand with what? Jake turns to the WAGON they rode from Jake's gang camp -- the WHISKEY CRATES. Sweeps up a bottle:
JAKE => This. An impossible mission. Sure death. Yet for the first time... they have an ADVANTAGE. Emmett cuts the moment with a BIG GRIN:
EMMETT => Hell, yeah. Let's squish some bugs. Grey Wolf CHUCKLES, murmurs. Jake looks to Nat for translation:
JAKE => Somethin' funny?
NAT COLORADO => Yeah... that you whites finally know what it feels like to face extinction. Now that we're on the same side, he says we can all die together.
JAKE => Guess that means you're not waitin' for your dad to come back. Colorado's face CLOUDS. Years of ANGER and RESENTMENT:
NAT COLORADO => Been Woodrow Dolarhyde's son my whole life... first time he ever copped to it was to save his own ass.  He's not comin' back. And as Colorado TURNS away, the PERCUSSION finds another GEAR --
MOLOTOV COCKTAILS... => Emmett works with Apaches and their KIDS, roping WOOD together to build LADDERS and CATAPULTS... WAR PAINT is applied to faces in DARK STREAKS...
JAKE => Not you, Kid.
EMMETT => Aw, hell, we been through this. Ya can't stop me. Jake draws his gun, SPINS it in his palm, aims at Emmett's FOOT:
JAKE => I can shoot you in the foot.
EMMETT => Bu111i11SHIT. Jake SIGHS -- bluff called. Holsters the gun and takes a knee... but just when we think this is gonna be a tender moment, he GRABS Emmett by the collar, pulls him CLOSE:
JAKE => You told me your daddy's all you got left. Want me to save his ass? Then park yours right there on the ground, you little shit. Got me? Emmett's nailed. ANGRY, but knows he's gotta stay.
EMMETT => Yeah. I gotcha. Jake releases him. Happy moves to Ella but she TSKS:
ELLA => Stay with the kid, Happy. The dog WHINES but complies, moving next to Emmett. Jake climbs on his horse. Looks back to the boy -- now he Ia tender:
JAKE => I'll get your father back. Bastard still owes me fifty dollars. The hint of a SMIRK... long enough for Emmett to SMIRK BACK. Ella, Doc, and Colorado mount p too, along with a 10-MAN APACHE WAR PARTY. Jake meets eyes with GREY WOLF:
JAKE => You'll be ready? Grey Wolf NODS. Some part of the PLAN we have yet to learn. And now Jake starts to trot off, Ella beside him. This plays just between the two of them:
ELLA => That's a nice thing... what you said to the boy. I didn't know better, I'd say you got yourself a sweet side. She smiles. But Jake turns to her -- deadly serious:
JAKE => There's nothin' sweet about me. I told that kid what he needed to hear so he wouldn't get in my damn way. All I care about is killin' that thing. And Ella reacts to the DARKNESS in his voice. Shakes her head:
ELLA => I don't believe that.
JAKE => Well believe it. I was playing a part.  Just like you were. He CRACKS the reins, riding ahead. HOLD ON ELLA... who finally follows as they all ride out and MUSIC SOARS:
THE WOMAN => What are you doing? Without response, he levels the axe and SLAMS it down on the FLOORBOARDS. Wood chips SPRAY until a GASH is opened. Dolar REACHES in... pulling out a CANVAS BAG. A few COINS spill out... COLD. He picks them up -- looks at the woman:
DOLARHYDE => Need it to save Nat.
THE WOMAN => Is he okay?
DOLARHYDE => He's gonna be. A storm of mixed emotions in his eyes. That stoic Dolarhyde veneer starts to CRACK... just a hint... as the woman MOVES to him... and TOUCHES his face. And he lets her. WHOA. We realize: this woman is COLORADO'S MOTHER. Dolarhyde, for all his wicked bluster, LOVES AN APACHE.
DOLARHYDE => I won't let anything happen to him, Jenny.
JAKE => You and Percy're brothers, huh?
NAT COLORADO => ... half.
JAKE => So... your momma and Dolarhyde---
NAT COLORADO => We friends now? Last I checked, you shot my ear off.
JAKE =>  Want it back?
BRONC! => BRONC and HUNT look up. Draws their GUNS. So does the rest of the gang... until they see the rider's waving a WHITE FLAG. As he comes closer -- they realize it's DOLARHYDE:
HUNT => One of them fellas Jake was ridin' with! Dolarhyde rides into camp, REARING in front of 30 guns
BRONC => The hell you want?
DOLARHYDE => It's about what you want. He reaches into his pocket and tosses Bronc a GOLD COIN:
DOLARHYDE => Lonergan stole your gold. That's a taste of what I got -- more'n you've ever seen. It's all yours if you help me get my boy back. The men trade LOOKS. Bronc eyes the coin. Alight with greed:
BRONC => Who's got your boy?
DOLARHYDE => Well, there's the rub.
DOC => In case we live through this. They SNEAK on down the narrow shaft til they're funneled into...
JAKE => We're never gonna get close to that ship. Silently. a DRIPPING. GLISTENING SHAPE rises un from the WATER behind them. Swaying like a COBRA ready to strike: Our people TURN... the TUBE ALIEN snatches one of the Apaches, SWALLOWING HIM in its thorny snout! The indian SCREAMS --
JAKE => Lights a WHISKEY MOLOTOV, hurls it at the CREATURE: BOOM! It KEENS, BURNING, SPITTING OUT the Apache. ALERTED, the dozen aliens by the transport SWARM at our heroes!
NAT COLORADO => C g_that shuttle. Colorado readies his TOMAHAWK -- Jake meets his eyes:
JAKE => Knew there was a good reason I didn't kill you.
NAT COLORADO => Just thinkin' the same thing. The men trade FATEFUL LOOKS... then the Indians HURL MOLOTOVS at the charging horde: KAAA-BOOM! Aliens TWIST and SCREAM -- The Apaches STRIKE FEARLESSLY -- but the aliens quickly RECOVER and SHAKE THEM OFF, tearing most of them to SHREDS. The horses BREAK FREE and crash madly through the cavern -- And this is the DISTRACTION Jake and Ella need to make their run, for the transport -- up the loading ramp:
ELLA => Jake - - 
JAKE. => She slaps open an ENGINEERING HATCH, drops down a LADDER. He takes a last awful look and SLIDES down after her --
ELLA => Strap in. dammit!!!
JAKE => Into what?!? Ella JAMS a lever forward and the shuttle RISES. JAKE grabs WEBBING that must be some type of SEATBELT, feeling the sensation of ELLQU as:
LET'S GO!!! => DOC comes RUNNING frantically:
ELLA => Hold on.
JAKE => Sheee-it.
DOC => They're gaining on us!
NAT COLORADO => That's the point! And just when it looks like Doc and Colorado are GONERS... BOOM! An EXPLOSION rocks the canyon as something HURTLES DOWN from above -- WHISKEY MOLOTOVS fired from the handmade CATAPULTS. BOOM! BOOM! Aliens are VAPORIZED, SHRIEKING! A cloudburst of FLAMING ARROWS brightens the sky as 20 APACHES RISE UP along the canyon rims: A AMBUSH! An ASSEMBLY LINE OF SQUAWS works like a drill team, soaking WHISKEY RAGS and wrapping arrows. Among them, EMMETT and HAPPY! The kid pocks an arrow like a damn EXPERT -- IGNITES it -- lets it FLY -- WHOOSH! It SKEWERS a speeder pilot who BURSTS INTO FLAMES, the speeder CORKSCREWS into another one, both EXPLODING:
THE ALIENS => Caught OFF-GUARD with NO WM TO TURN AROUND as from the OPPOSITE END of the canyon, a BELLOWING WAR WHOOP:
ELLA JAKE => -- Dammit --- -- what--?
ELLA => Engines are warming up -- got eight minutes til the ship leaves, and about one til automated retrieval --
JAKE => -- autojamated what --?
ELLA => Hug the wall. Jake does that beside her as the next bolt PINGS out --
ELLA => When they come at us, aim for their heads. Only way to kill 'em for sure. He looks at his bracelet, adrenaline SURGING -- it ACTIVATES:
JAKE => I'll aim just fine. THE LAST BOLT FIRES and the airlock door SHOOTS OFF:
JAKE => SonofaBITCH! The manipulator arms SCOOP UP COCOONS, pulling them DOWN the
C'MON! => She JUMPS through the airlock -- Jake has no time to think:
DAMMIT -- => And JUMPS after her --
CIDYAPLQLWJJ => -- she PULLS HIM into an alcove as a machine arm SWINGS overhead, flashing a WIDE CONICAL LASER that inventories cocoons like the machine in the underground cave. As they CROUCH:
ELLA => We can't let that thing see us or they'll know we're here. She turns -- hits buttons on a console -- a door SLIDES UP leading to a series of CORRIDORS. She starts to MOVE --
ELLA => This'll take us to the bridge -- But Jake doesn't follow. STARES at her --
JAKE => Slaver's up there--?
ELLA => I sure as hell hope not.
JAKE => Then I'm not goin' with you. And now she HARDENS --
ELLA => You got any idea how big this ship is? No ray you'll ever find him alone. Be like findin' a needle in a-- -- SLAM!! Jake interrupts her by aiming at the LASER SCANNER and FIRING HIS BLASTER, blowing it apart. The scanner eye CRASHES to the floor, flaming. A KLAXON rings --
JAKE => I ain't gonna find him. He's gonna find me.
ELLA => Thanks for the head start. She turns and RUNS. Jake moves to that scanner eye on the floor, walks right up to it and STARES into the shattered IRIS:
JAKE => Alright, you sonofabitch... come and get me.
DOC => I need more bandages now!/ You: lint and splint that leg!
GREY WOLF => We're losing ranks ! ! ! And then, out of nowhere... the BANG BANG BANG of 30 pistols fills the air as -- DOLARHYDE RIDES IN WITH JAKE'S GANG! A renewed SURGE of energy as cowboys join Indians to fortify their ranks:
NAT COLORADO => You came back!
DOLARHYDE => Told you: I take care of my kin. Colorado knows that's as close to "I love you" as he'll ever get. But the UPSWING is short-lived as: A speeder WHIZZES past, dropping a METALLIC BUNDLE. It splits open right in front of the fort's STEEL GATES -- pieces hydraulically ASSEMBLING THEMSELVES in seconds, becoming: THE MOTHERFUCKING SUPERGUN_OF DEATH. TWO LETHAL BARRELS spin to life, firing STRANGE STEEL BALL BEARINGS in every direction. CLAW HOOKS snap out of the balls, EMBEDDING in soldiers! One LODGES in a GANG MEMBER beside DOC -- he FLAILS:
JAKE => Drop the woman. We both know this ain't about her. But The Slaver only presses his blaster HARDER into Ella's neck. Almost GRINNING. And Jake MEETS the look --
JAKE => She says you're as bad as they come. Jake curls back the fingers on both hands, CRACKING knuckles:
JAKE => Well, you ugly sonofabitch... they say the same about me. A pipe SPEWS STEAM -- UNNERVINGLY LOUD. Then STOPS.
JAKE => Could'a had your boys kill me five times over, instead you rolled out the red carpet... so let's get it over with.
BEHIND YOU!!! => Jake WHIRLS, SLAM!!! The creature FLIES off its feet.
JAKE => Stay down. Ella does, and here come the rest of the aliens as Jake GUNS
turbine HOWL. => Corpses litter the floor... all except for The Slaver. A trail of FLUORESCENT BLOOD leads around the corner... Jake WHIRLS to Ella -- her leg wounded --
JAKE => -- you alright? In PAIN, she snatches one of those SMART DISCS off a dead alien:
ELLA => Reactor's hit. if I don't get this ship on the ground soon, we're all dead...  Get me over to that turbolift. He slings an arm around her shoulder and LIFTS her, helping her to the elevator --
ELLA => Put me inside. He does. She sees his eyes go back to The Slaver's BLOOD TRAIL:
ELLA => I can manage the rest without you. (tough... but with
COMPASSION) => Go do what you came up here to do. He looks at her. At the blood. At the unstable REACTOR. And Jake Lonergan makes a CHOICE:
JAKE => Goddamnit. -- he gets INTO THE ELEVATOR with her. She SLAMS the control pad, doors CLOSE -- they start rocketing upward. She half-grins as her eyes hold on him. And within them... trust. AND FAITH.
JAKE => Stop smiling.
DOL.ARHYDE => The hell iz that? Grey Wolf MOANS in pain. Doc SHOUTS to Dolar:
DOC => Tell him to hold still! If I have this thing figured right, long as t keep my finger under the red pin we won't blow up!
GREY WOLF => What's he saying?:
DOLARHYDE => He says we're all gonna die.
COLORADO => We need to pull it out of his shoulder!
DOLARHYDE => I'm not pullin' anything!
SHIT! => Dolarhyde gets an IDEA. HARDENS. Looks Doc right in the eye:
DOLARHYDE => Alright, listen -- you slide your finger from under that pin, I'll slip mine in and hold it in place. Then you pull it out and I'll throw it. Doc NODS fearfully. Dolar carefully SLIPS his finger under the pin as Doc SLIPS it out. PHEW. Now Doc takes hold of the grenade itself, nods "ready" to pull it out. Grey Wolf braces
DOC => On three...
DOLARHYDE => -- Wait. Everyone LURCHES from the tension interrupt:
DOLARHYDE => Tell your wife we're clear.
DOC => What?
DOLARHYDE => -- your wife. Maria. We had an arrangement. I left your saloon alone and she paid me off. ON DOC. Reeling, now REALLY confused --
DOC => We're broke. Paid you off with what?
DOLARHYDE => She stole from the people in your morgue. Gold teeth, trinkets, pocket watches -- It LANDS on Doc: that's why he fond the watch under their bed.
DOC => I thought she was cheating!
DOLARHYDE => Just robbin' corpses.
DOC => Thank God!  Wait. You hate me. Why're you telling me this? With GENUINE REMORSE:
DOLARHYDE => May not get another chance --
WHAT'RE YOU-- => Dolarhyde looks at Colorado:
DOLARHYDE => Tell your mother I love her. With that, he CHARGES into the swirling chaos
WAIT! => -- but BOOM! Colorado's FORCED BACK by an explosion -- through the debris, he sees his father running toward...
NO!!!!! => But his sacrifice 7M S THE TIDE! THE EXPLOSION BLOWS THE
ELLA => We're going down fast. She calls up telemetry on a HOLO-WINDOW: EARTH TERRAIN -- The BATTLEFIELD. Sets coordinates, vectoring the ship that way: A WHIR as a SECOND TURBOLIFT arrives... AND THE SLAVER STEPS QQT. Wounded, and very PISSED OFF. Jake says to Ella:
JAKE => No matter what. Jake and The Slaver HURTLE into each other, TUMBLE off a catwalk, CRASHING into conduits and GUNKY WATER below. Jake staggers up but The Slaver is HUGE -- SLAMS Jake back into the water. PINS A FOOT on his blaster arm -- CRUSHING IT. Jake HOWLS as The Slaver presses a series of those HIEROGLYPH MARKINGS on Jake's BRACELET -- the symbols LIGHT UP in an UNLOCK CODE -- and KA-CHING! The bracelet POPS OF.E. The Slaver TOSSES IT into the gunky water. Draws his LASER WHIP -- WHUP-SNAP! The white-hot tip LASHES JAKE'S BACK, ripping his shirt and BURN-SCARRING HIS BACK! Jake SCREAMS in agony as The Slaver WHIPS HIM MERCILESSLY --
GREY WOLF => Fall back!!! NOW!! NOW!!
JAKE => Go to hell.
ELLA => I lied.
JAKE => ... I know.
ELLA => No, I heard what you said when I was layin' there...
ELLA => You are a good man. At least... to me. The ground GROWS BIGGER out the window. Her HAND reaches over for his. JAKE'S HAND clasps hers and --
comes... => EMMETT, HAPPY, and DOC, with GREY WOLF's arm slung over his shoulder. Among other faces, White and Apache... all of them PROUD WARRIORS. Staring in awe at:
PAW!!!! PAW!!!! => The kid GRABS his father and holds him for dear life, as Taggart stares back in a daze --
EMMETT => It's me -- it's Emmett. And somewhere in there, RECOGNITION comes to the Sheriff's eyes... Emmett SMILES and throws his arms around his father again as --
COLORADO => Moving through the FALLEN BODIES toward the lifeless form of Dolarhyde, his FATHER. Eyes welling, he drops to his knees...
A VOICE => Nat? Colorado turns -- it's PERCY. Confused. Like waking from a dream. Sees his father on the ground...
PERCY => What... happened? And all Colorado can say is...
NAT COLORADO => He's dead. That HANGS there. Percy blinks. And then --
PERCY => Who's gettin' the ranch? ON COLORADO. At first, words that don't compute. Then PURE BLIND RAGE takes hold and his FISTS FLY, PUNCHING PERCY:
HEY! => Colorado WHIRLS -- DOLARHYDE IS STAGGERING TO HIS FEET, ALIVE!
DOLARHYDE => No one's gettin' my ranch. Stunned, Colorado GRINS. Percy spits blood, points accusingly --
PERCY => Paw, he-- Dolarhyde SMACKS Percy across the face:
PERCY => OW!!! What'd you do that for?
UOLARHYUE => For being an ungrateful little bastard. Now shake your brother's hand and thank him for saving your ass, cause it's more than you ever would'a done bjM.
DOLARHYDE => That's better.
JAKE => Staggers through the crowd. And sees ELLA. Thgy did it. But she still looks TROUBLED. Staring out at the vast desert...
JAKE => . what is it?
ELLA => We didn't get all of 'em. Some ran oft. That LANDS on Jake, as he too looks toward the endless horizon. HOLD on them, together, a VICTORIOUS but UNRESOLVED note... We RISE UP over the sea of bodies and the CRASHED SHIP, until Jake and Ella are just two small figures in the crowd...
EMMETT => -- what? What'd I dQ?
SHERIFF TAGGART => Kid's got a mouth on him.
DEPUTY WADE => Well, Kyle, considering he saved your life, guess you'll just have to grin'n bear it. Dolar moves up to Taggart, tough as ever. The men HOLD looks:
SHERIFF TAGGART => Woodrow.
DOLARHYDE => Kyle. Percy STEWS about something. Dolar WHACKS him upside the head:
DOLARHYDE => Go_ _on. Grudgingly, Percy hands Taggart a SHEAF OF PAPER --
SHERIFF TAGGART => What's this?
DOLARHYDE => Claims to the land 50 miles west of here. I've signed it over to the township of Absolution.  Considering I'm a businessman, I figure expansion's in both our interests. Needs the Sheriff's signature to be official.
SHERIFF TAGGART => Fifty miles west of here is where the goldmine is, Woodrow.
SHERIFF TAGGART => What's this about twenty percent going to the Apaches? Dolarhyde glances at Colorado. A moment. But the hardened rancher maintains his rock-solid facade:
DOLARHYDE => Figure the only way not to piss 'em off is to buy 'em.
SHERIFF TAGGART => Since when'd you worry about pissin' anyone off?
DOLARHYDE => Just sign it, Goddamnit. With a grin, Taggart gestures for Deputy Wade to turn around and flattens the paper on his BACK, using it as a surface to SIGN:
SHERIFF TAGGART => I'd say you were being generous, Woodrow, but I know you'd just be insulted.
DOLARHYDE => Damn right. Dolar gives his hat a TIP, then mounts up to go -- and we RISE UP to the UPPER FLOOR of the GOLD LEAF SALOON, in the process of being rebuilt in grand style -- and MOVE IN on a WINDOW where:
DOC MARIA => SHH! The workers will hear us!!! Let them hear! As they TUMBLE back onto the bed, Doc LURCHES. Reaches under his back to find... a GOLD POCKETWATCH.
DOC => What is this?
MARIA => Look at the inscription. He flips it open to find an ENGRAVING: "MI CORAZON... POR SIEMPRE." Doc looks up at her, MOVED. Then -- PLAYFULLY:
DOC => This looks like Aldo Mayberry's watch...
MARIA => Shut up and kiss me. She pulls him down, OUT OF FRAME --
ELLA => Second damn time that dog ran off on me.
JAKE => Second time he brought me to you. Happy's tail wags. The look between Jake and Ella HOLDS. And it seems freighted with everything. Finally, he breaks it -- glancing at the Apaches finishing their work with the dynamite, and the remnants of the ALIEN SHIP and FORTRESS below.
JAKE => Looks like you got everything set. Ella eyes Jake's horse, loaded with GEAR. Looks up, clearly
ELLA => Where you headed?
ELLA => Messes.
JAKE => ... Yep.  What. She walks right up to his horse. Right up to HIM:
ELLA => I think you're ridin' off cause you're just scared of what'll happen if you stay. An INFERENCE here. Ella's going BOLD. Jake swings off his horse, lands beside her. Now. Almost CURIOUS:
JAKE => And what's gonna happen?
ELLA => You know. A CHARGE between them. All they wanna do is KISS... But that'd be too easy. And those wounds of his, they haven't quite healed. He drops his eyes; SOFTLY NOW:
JAKE => If I stay... it's not gonna be good for anybody, Ella. A beat. She looks off. Nods. They say nothing. And now he slowly climbs back on his horse. Ella TOUGHENS:
ELLA => Heard some rumors outta Abilene. Weird noises at night. Cattle mutilations. Weather phenomena. Figured I'd ride down there. Give it a look-see.
JAKE =>  What's 'phenomena'?
ELLA => Big storms in places that don't get big storms. ON JAKE. Every fighting instinct in him suddenly IGNITED, though he plays it down:
JAKE => You goin' down there yourself?
ELLA => Why? You worried about me? You bet your ass he is. But, he shakes his head--
JAKE => No, ma'am. You can take care of yourself just fine.  Be seein' you around.
ELLA => goodbye, Jake. He gets back on his horse. Starts to ride off. Happy BARKS and trots alongside him. BARK BARK BARK. In dog that means "Don't be an idiot." Jake glances over --
JAKE => Get the hell away from me, you damn mutt.
JAKE => Abilene happens to be on my way. He reaches out a hand... she takes it... as he PULLS HER UP INTO THE SADDLE. Ella grinning ear-to-ear as she folds her arms around his waist. Jake -- ever the outlaw -- grumbles:
JAKE => Stop smiling, Goddammit. He KICKS the horse and Happy follows. Ella shoots a goodbye look to Grey Wolf, who NODS. Signals his men and FUSES ARE LIT: The DYNAMITE FUSES ssssssnake down the mountain -- reaching the canyon floor -- INTO those limestone tunnels where CLUSTERS OF DYNAMITE have been placed... and as FUSE MEETS EXPLOSIVE: ANGLE - JAKE AND ELLA CRESTING A HILL -- B000000000000MI The THUNDER of EXPLOSIONS makes them rear. They turn back to see...
