On the wall behind him we see photo- graphs and paintings of oil wells and refineries. PAPPAGALLO takes a wad of maps and puts them in his briefcase, followed by a copy of 'Whole Earth Catalogue" and another book. The cover reads:

LIKE MEN. => field, is a strange assortment of WARRIO1 They are cannibalising a farm vehicle: siphoning its fuel and loading food and other loot into their bizarre vehicles. The DOG growls. MAX looks further along the ridge. On the bor:.zon we see a burning wooden s:iack and three bodies strung from a gnarled, dead tree. MAX looks back to the MEN. Several of then, having seen him, are running to their vehicles. The first of them is a muscular man with a red mohawk haircut. He is heavily protected by a leather and metal chest plate, shoulder pads and leggings. This is WEZ. Sc. 4. Cont..
supercharger. => The black-on-black slows... The DOG whimpers, crawls off its chair and under Max's seat. WEZ overhauls MAX on the passenger side: He raises his forearm, aiming his gauntlet-style crossbow at MAX'S head. MAX barely has time to glimpse the road racer drawing alongside the driver's door. The passenger - a GAYBOY BERSERKER - wields a brutal, gas-powered 'gun': the heads of six metal arrows protrude from a big barrel. This weapon is the "porta-pak". MAX hits the brakes, The road racer and the bike surge past the black car... just as the porta-pak fires. Two arrows thud into the black car, three go astray and one hits WEZ in the arm. MAX throws the black car in behind the road racer... WEZ, fighting to control the bike, leaves the road... MAX changes down and hits the supercharger... The black car leaps forward, ramming into the back of the road racer, bullying it along. Wheels and metal screaming, the two cars approach an intersection littered with furniture and other debris. A road rig lies abandoned on the roadside. MAX eases back for a moment then flattens the accelerator... The black car slams into the back of the road racer... hurling it forward, just as the dune buggy regains the highway...
intersection. => MAX, carrying a jerry can, gets out of the black car. He looks down the highway.
ruptured tank. => From inside the wreck we hear the moans of the injured driver. MAX puts the jerry can under the escaping fuel and tearing a bandana from his neck - mops up the gasolene lying on the bitumen. Suddenly, there is a shrill whistle. MAX looks up at the crest of the road.
WEZ => For you. With that he puts the arrow back into his quiver and guns the motor. He rea.; the front wheel, hangs there a moment, then spins th,: bike around and roars back
Birthday". => He stops next to the vehicle, in the middle of the intersection. He looks from one direction to another. undecided... and then sees the smashed road sign. He picks up a fragment which reads:
GYRO CAPTAIN => Don't hurt that snake!
GYRO CAPTAIN => Put him back... gently! MAX lays the snake on the rotor.
GYRO CAPTAIN => Sounded like a big V-8 to me. I guess I got myself some guzzolene. He raises his bow, aiming at MAX'S head, preparing to fire.
MAX => The car's booby-trapped. Touch those tanks and BOOM! You'll blow yourself apart. The CAPTAIN looks quickly in the direction of the black-on-black, and back to MAX. He gestures with the crossbow.
GYRO CAPTAIN => Drop the weapons... Now back up. MAX throws down the tyre iron and unhitches a bolster which contains a sawn-off shotgun. The CAPTAIN slings the gunbelt over his stoulder.
the dune. => Sc, 1.6. Cont..
GYRO CAPTAIN => You're quick, I'll give you that. Never seen a man beat a snake. Never. Reflexes, that's what you've got. Me? I've got brains. He taps his head as they arrive at the black-on-black.
GYRO CAPTAIN => Now, where's this booby-trap? MAX reaches under the car. His hand groping for a machete clipped to the chassis. His fingers wrap around the handle.
GYRO CAPTAIN => A fella - a quick fella - might keep a weapon under there. He nuzzles,the bow against the back of MAX'S head.
GYRO CAPTAIN => Then I'd have to pin his head to the panel. MAX slides his hand away, disconnects a series of mechanical fuses and shows them to the CAPTAIN. He moves to open the driver's door. The CAPTAIN reacts quickly, raising his bow, motioning MAX back.
MAX => There's one more.
GYRO CAPTAIN => Oh no! You don't play me the fool. The CAPTAIN, keeping the crossbow trained on MAX'S head, opens the door. The DOG flies out, leaping for the CAPTAIN'S throat. The crossbow discharges, narrowly missing MAX as he hurls himself at the CAPTAIN. The steel arrow buries r itself in the car door. MAX pins the CAPTAIN to the ground and recovers his shotgun. Sc, 16. Cont...
16. Cont. => MAX cocks the gun next to the CAPTAIN'S head.
GYRO CAPTAIN => Gas! Petrol! Guzzolene! Listen! Hundreds... thousands of `gallons... as much as you want... MAX eases off the trigger.
MAX => Where?
GYRO CAPTAIN => Not far. Ten... maybe twenty miles. Pumping it they are. Refining it. Kachunk... kachunk... kachunk... Day and night. A huge tanker full.
MAX => Balls!
GYRO CAPTAIN => It's there, you betcha... I'll. tell you straight though - it's not self service. It's under guard. Too hard for me. But a man with your ingenuity... Jesus I reckon... MAX rams the barrel against the CAPTAIN'S head.
MAX => Where?
GYRO CAPTAIN => Kill. me, and you'll never find out. MAX drags him to his feet and pushes him towards the black-on-black.
country. => The DOG'S eyes dart out the window. He whimpers, body twitching. The CAPTAIN stares in horror at a rabbit bounding through the scrub. MAX smiles t') himself. The DOG settles back. i8. A CLIFFTOP OVERLOOKING THE COMPOUND. DAY. MAX moves towards the cliff edge. A column of smoke rises into the sky, accompanied by a garble of distant sounds: police sirens; car horns; men screaming; war-whoops; and revving motors. The GYRO CAPTAIN - manacled and guarded by the DOG - hobbles along behind MAX. From the top of the cliff MAX looks down On a battle raging on the plain below. A fortified encampment, surrounded by a wide ditch and coils of barbed wire, is under attack by a large gang of MARAUDERS: MOHAWK BIKERS, SMEGMA CRAZIES in dune buggies, and GAYBOY BERSERKERS in road racers. They attack along a road which passes through an area - outside the fortifications - which is under cultivation. Three wooden work huts, a small barn and a corral containing several cows and a horse are dotted around a newly-ploughed field. As the Marauders' vehicles come within range of the compound, they stream around the perimeter, firing crossbows at the DEFENDERS ranged along the battlements.
the HUMUNGUS. => Beside him, is the Mohawk Biker called WEZ. He sits astride his bike, the GOLDEN YOUTH clinging to his waist. He speaks with HUMUNGUS, pointing, sweeping his hand.
GYRO CAPTAIN => Okay, there it is. If anyone can get in, I know it's gonna be you. Me,.. I've gotta feed the snakes. Sc. 21, Cont -
21,. Cont. => MAX drops the binoculars. The CAPTAIN offers his wrists to be unmanacled.
GYRO CAPTAIN => A man lives by his word, I reckon. And I've kept mine... MAX gets to his feet and hauls the GYRO CAPTAIN to a nearby tree stump.
GYRO CAPTAIN => Look! We had a deal: I show you the gas - You let me go. MAX starts to chain him to the stump.
MAX => The contract was: wouldn't kill you. The GYRO CAPTAIN turns angry, protesting. MAX pushes the shotgun close to his face.
MAX => I reckon you got a bargain... Don't you? The CAPTAIN shuts up. MAX tests the chain. The sounds of the battle continue.
the compound. => The bike flies through the air... and bounces into the wire. The RIDER sails over the fence into the compound where he is set upon by THREE DEFENDERS.
field. => As they pull back to the high ground surrounding the camp, they set fire to the farm huts and drag off the carcasses of the dead animals. The fires blaze fiercely on the darkening plain.
the plain. => The MARAUDERS camped on the rise rouse themselves... climbing aboard their vehicles. The GYRO CAPTAIN, tethered to the stump, strains at his chain but cannot get close enough to the edge to see...
GYRO CAPTAIN => What's up!! MAX ignores him, concentrating on the situation below. ' The bulk of the MARAUDERS have split into three groups each chasing a camp vehicle off into the wasteland. The HUMUNGUS leads one of the groups. Four MARAUDERS, camped on a pinnacle, keep watch on the camp, Suddenly another vehicle bursts out of the camp and speeds across the plain towards MAX'S clifftop. It passes out-of sight around the back of the hill, MAX hurries from his canopy across the other side of the hilltop.
moment. => He lifts the telescope and pans to one side.
GYRO CAPTAIN => Jesus! He's gonna kill her. MAX whips his telescope around...
crossbow... => The image blurrs...
GYRO CAPTAIN => Hey! What about me?!! The black-on-black roars off...
his trousers, => Close to his back, the camera stops. He turns, looking up. MAX, carrying a pair of bolt cutters is hurrying towards him.
'fu. l,.UUI.. => The MOHAWKER grabs for his crossbow. MAX'S foot stamps down, pinning his wrist... Ssswish? the bolt cutters swing down... onto the Mohawker's head. Tears stream down the COMPOUND MAN'S face. As MAX walks up to him we see that he is bleeding badly. His name is NATHAN.
NATHAN => Thank you. Thank you...
MAX => Let's get this straight. I'm doing it 'cos I need fuel.
NATHAN => As much as you want. Take me back... Don't let me die. MAX takes the bolt cutters and inserts them between the man and the panel. He cuts away the first arrow, then the second.
compound. => NATHAN is slipping into unconsciousness. MAX grabs him by the shoulder, shaking him.
MAX => Stay alive! Stay alive!
foreground. => He is joined by TWO OTHER MARAUDERS. The GAYBOY BERSERKER grabs a hand-mirror and flashes a signal across the wasteland. From a far hill, we see the answering flash.
catwalk. => The black car stops just outside crossbow range - about twenty yards short of the compound. In extreme foreground, the FERAL BOY'S head pops up from another rabbit hole closer to the compound. He ducks down out of sight when the car door opens. High angle on MAX as he steps out of the car with NATHAN across his shoulders. MAX carries no weapons and as he steps up to camera, he raises his arms high... A woman on the barricade begins screaming. Her name is BIG REBECCA, Sc-44, Cont.
BIG REBECCA => Nathan! Nathan! It's Nathan. A man on the catwalk orders the gate to be opene3.. MAX hurries along the causeway... The FERAL KID comes out of the rabbit warren and begins to follow MAX. A trail of blood drips from the injured man onto the causeway... As MAX approaches the camp the old ello'.v school bus is pulled aside. The I A3IRI011 WOMAN emerges, crossbow read., , keeping it trained on MAX. She is followed by another defender the MECHANIC'S ASSISTANT - pulling a strange mechanised crane. Suspended from the front of this machine is a paraplegic, He is the MECHANIC. Thny MAX, heading for the car, revealing BIG RLU,CC.A, distraught, running towards him,
BIG REBECCA => Nathan! God have mercy., What a waste. Si,F wipe the man's face, caressing him., as MAX walks on. She turns and looks straight at the camp's leader, PAPPAGALLO. He"is standing at the gate, surrounded by anxious defenders.
BIG REBECCA => Look at your handiwork! They didn't have a chance... One of the group at the gate -- a nuggety old man called the CURMUDGEON - plays to the crowd, pointing
THE CURMUDGEON => You all heard me, I warned him didn't I? Madness, I said.
WARRIOR WOMAN => Pity your name wasn't pulled out the hat.
CURMUDGEON => We can escape, take our petrol, he said. How? I said. Get a prime mover, he said... He points to NATHAN who is being carried to an old bread van. The rear door is open, revealing two hospital-style beds, drip stands and shelves of medical supplies. An injured camp member occupies one of the beds.
CURMUDGECN => .And there's the result! Madness I said! PAPPAGALLO ignores him, addressing MAX:
PAPPAGALLO => Where did you find him?
MAX => Two, three miles away.,, left for dead.,, next to his car. We made a deal. In the background the FARMER starts to work the first arrow out of NATHAN'S chest. BIG REBECCA comforts him. Sc. 45. Cont...
PAPPAGALLO => Three other vehicles. Did you see them?
MAX => Running hard to the south west. In heaps of trouble. Listen: he said if I brought him in, you'd give me gas. There's no time... An anxious young man pushes through the crowd, talking over MAX. This is the QUIET MAN.
QUIET MAN => There was a woman... in the car... MAX looks straight at him.
MAX => She's dead. The man struggles to keep hold of his emotions.
QUIET MAN => How? What did they do?
MAX => It was quick. The QUIET MAN bows his head and turns away. NATHAN groans, ANGIE has the clear plastic mask of an air viva device over NATHAN'S face, PISMO pumps air into his lungs. MAX turns to PAPPAGALLO:
MAX => I saw a man in trouble. I brought him in. And now I just want to get out of here. Give me my gas. Sc. 45. Cont.
WARRIOR WOMAN => For all we know, he's one of them. Give him nothing. There's an ugly murmur of agreement. MAX, keeping his temper, talks to PAPPAGALLO:
MAX => We had a contract... The FARMER succeeds in removing the first arrow. BIG REBECCA relaxes NATHAN sputters. Blood sprays into the plastic mask. BIG REBECCA screams. The FERAL KID looks on as the FARMER feels for a pulse: nothing. PAPPAGALLO turns to MAX:
PAPPAGALLO => I don't know who you are, or what happened. But if you had a contract, it was with him. And it died with him. PAPPAGALLO t'.trns on his heel and walks through the crowd, back towards his tent. The WARRIOR WOMAN puts a bow to MAX'S temple and shoves him towards the gate.
-1b. t;OIIt. => The MECHANIC supervises the work. LIAX stiffens, furious.. . WARRIOR WOMAN prods him with the bow:
WARRIOR WOMAN => Be thankful, you're still alive. She pushes him past the car. The DOG trained to protect the vehicle begins to grow]. The MECHIANIC turns to MAX:
MECHANIC => I gotta hand it to you. Some machine... He holds up the detonators and fuse wire.
MECHANIC => Would've been a shame to bloc it:. up. The last of the pursuit spec- ials. It's history, that's what it is. A piece of history...

The DOG, MAX and the camp people are frozen, waiting for the next move, WARRIOR WOMAN, holding the other end of the bow, motions him forward, Slowly MAX bends and gathers up the DOG. Sc. 46. Cont
MAX => Its OK, Dog. Just do as they say... His words are lost in the wail of a siren. A guard perched in the watch tower shouts a warning. The yellow school bus roars across, closing the entrance.
battlements. => A pair of manacles are locked around MAX'S wrists. WARRIOR WOMAN climbs to a big crossbow mounted above the causeway. The BUTCHER drops her knife and grabs her long bow. The rabbit on the chopping block leaps for safety. PAPPAGALLO mans the flame thrower. Others draw their bows. The FERAL KID follows the rabbit down a hole at the foot of the battlement. As MAX climbs to a position on the battlements near WARRIOR WOMAN and PAPPAGALLO he sees that the MARAUDER HORDE has gathered in all its glory.
MECHANIC => Poor mongrels... not one got through. BIG REBECCA sobs. The QUIET MAN puts a comforting hand on her shoulder. PISMO and ANGIE huddle closer together.
TOADIE => Greetings from the Lord Humungus The Warrior of the Wasteland! The Ayatollah of Rock and Roller. Camera cranes up to the HUMUNGUS as he rises in his seat. His voice is amplified by two loudspeakers mounted to the roll cage of his vehicle: Sc. 50, Cont...
HUMUNGUS => I am told you wish to take the gasolene out of the wasteland... The SECOND VICTIM lashed onto the Humungus vehicle shouts in defiance:
DEFIANT VICTIM => Shoot! Shoot him! While you've got the chance... The TOADIE takes the wind out of him with an elbow to the stomach... The FERAL KID watches from a rabbit warren near a burnt out hut. The HUMUNGUS continues...
HUMUNGUS => You set out this morning to find a vehicle. A vehicle strong enough to haul that fat tank of gas... Suddently, the escaped rabbit runs from a hole in the barricade and out into the wasteland. WEZ whirls his arm around... thud!... the rabbit falls dead from a crossbow bolt. The FERAL KID eases back down into his hole. The TOADIE bellows:
TOADIE => You see! There is no escape. The Humungus rules the wasteland...
DEFIANT VICTIM => Don't give them the gas! Blow it up! WEZ leaps from his bike and head-butts the man into unconsciousness, The BROKEN VICTIM sobs uncontrollably. Sc. 50. Cont...

WEZ => There's been enough talk. I'm going in! Powerful arms encircle him from behind. WEZ is lifted bodily from the seat. The HUMUNGUS reaches over and cuts the ignition and the P.A..system.
SUMUNGUS => Be still my dog of war. I understand your pain. We've all lost someone we love... But, we do it my way. Fear is our ally. Later, you can have your revenge. WEZ tries to break free but still, he cannot move. The HUMUNGUS reaches over and flicks on the P.A. System. Sc. 54. Cont.
HUMUNGUS => There has been too much violence too much pain. None here i s without sin, But, I have an honourable compromise. Give me the gasolene and I'll spare your lives. Just walk away. I will give you safe passage in the wasteland... Walk away and there will be an end to the horror... He hits the ignition, eases WEZ aside and turns the vehicle around...
HUMUNGUS => You have one full day to decide!! The TOADIE jumps on board as the HUMUNGUS leads the HORDE back over the rise. As the vehicles rumble away, the FERAL BOY retrieves his bloodied boomerang and scurries back into his hole.
QUIET MAN => We'll never walk away. Never! BIG REBECCA grabs him by the shoulder.
BIG REBECCA => Don't be a fool! It's our only chance... She turns to the other defenders:
BIG REBECCA => It's simple... we trade the gas for our lives.
WARRIOR WOMAN => No! We've worked too hard.
FARMER => Walk out there? They'd slaughter us... run us down for sport. BIG REBECCA plays to the crcwd.
BIG REBECCA => Don't listen to them! It's bad enough the lunatics are running the asylum. Don't let 'em throw away the key.
wrist. => He produces the hurdy-gurdy he found on the bloated man and plays the first few notes of "Happy Birthday". From the hole under MAX, the FERAL KID appears wiping his boomerang. He is attracted by the noise. MAX plays the next few notes faster. The FERAL KID grins. More notes - very fast. The FERAL KID laughs. Several people at the back of the CROWD, including WARRIOR WOMAN, turn around to look. MAX holds the manacles up so that she can see that he's free. She glares at him as he goes back to turning the hurdy-gurdy. The argument continues.
gate. => He has a Gladstone bag in his hand and a collection of car parts and personal effects tucked under his arm.
CURMUDGEON => it'll be alright. I'll talk to this Humungus. He'd never hurt an asthmatic ol.d man. The LUSTY GIRL is joining him.., The MECHANIC turns to her.
MECHANIC => I'm sure they'll find a use for you.
LUSTY => I'd rather be out there, on my back alive, than in here, on my back dead.

PAPPAGALLO => And just suppose he keeps it... The DEFENDERS turn to PAPPAGALLO, standing on the
PAPPAGALLO => .and we walk out of here with our lives. What then? Do we wander the wasteland - scavenging. Wake up one morning and find we're just like them - savages. He points in the direction of the MARAUDERS.
PAPPAGALLO => Is that what you want? I don't. Sc. 57. Cont.
BIG REBECCA => Words! Just words. You're going to die, for a pi,pedream. BIG REBECCA moves over to join the CURMUDGEON and the LUSTY GIRL.
WARRIOR WOMAN => No! We're going to fight for a belief - I stay! LUSTY looks straight at PAPPAGALLO, Sc. 57, Cont..,
LUSTY => I really wished it had worked, I'm sorry. The MECHANIC'S ASSISTANT starts to push tha MECHANIC'S contraption towsds the CURMUDGEON'S GROUP, but the.-MECHANIC resists, grabbing onto the catwalk. The ASSISTANT leaves him there. ANGIE takes the ASSISTANT'S place and pushes the MECHANIC'S contraption over to PAPPAGALLO'S side.
ANGIE => We stay! PISMO is left hesitating in the middle. After a terrible moment of indecision he joins ANGIE. The camp is now divided, mostly against PAPPAGALLO. The two groups stare across at each other solemnly... A voice is heard from the battlements,...
MAX => Two days ago I saw a vehicle that'd haul that tanker. All eyes turn to MAX.
MAX => You wanna get out of here. You talk to me.

MAX => So that's my offer. I deliver a prime mover - in return you give me my black car and as much gas'as I can carry. All I need right now is three jerry cans of diesel and five gallons of petroleum. They look at him quizzically. Think of it as a down payment.
WARRIOR WOMAN => That's the last we'll ever see of him.
BIG REBECCA => What have we got to lose? PAPPAGALLO nods.

CAPTAIN => Don't think you're gonna get any of this. Cos you're not. It was my snake. I found it. I trained it. And I'm gonna eat it. Keeping the gun trained on the CAPTAIN, MAX rummages through the MARAUDER'S clothes. He finds a necklace of spark plugs, bolts, teeth and two old shotgun cartridges. MAX removes the two cartridges. One crumbles apart. The second, although dog-eared, remains intact, The GYRO CAPTAIN looks up as MAX cracks open the shotgun - both barrels are empty. MAX shoves the dog-eared cartridge into the barrel and snaps the shotgun shut. The GYRO CAPTAIN gasps:
CAPTAIN => You mean? All this time? Jesus, that's dishonest! MAX nudges the CAPTAIN towards the gyrocopter. The CAPTAIN stands fast, eyeing the shotgun...
CAPTAIN => How do we know that one's not a dud.
MAX => There's only one way to find out. He lifts the barrel to the CAPTAIN'S head. The CAPTAIN moves off towards the gyrocopter.
handkerchief. => The DOG watches him carefully. MAX yanks on the chain. The GYRO CAPTAIN tests the motor: nothing. After two more attempts it splutters to life.

WEZ appears on the road ahead as a road racer rockets from out of the scrub in front of the prime mover. MAX shunts it back off the road and into the rear of the tow truck on blocks. The tow truck crashes down, pinning the SKINHEAD beneath it. 74, A RISE ABO'D'E rHE COMPOUND. DAY. 74. The HUMUNGUS - his vehicle sitting in_the middle of the road - turns at the sound of the crash.

MECHANIC => We got a hole through the radiator - into the timing case. Gonna take at least 24 hours.
PAPPAGALLO => You've got twelve. The crowd disperses. The QUIET MAN is carried to the bread van/medical centre; the bodies are removed; camp members load vehicles; men are working on the tanker. WARRIOR WOMAN climbs onto the battlement.
WARRIOR WOMAN => I want you to know... that was a very brave thing you did... He doesn't reply - just hands her the flame thrower and descends the ladder.
CURMUDGEON => .and tell me, son, this machine of yours - it takes two , does it? The GYRO CAPTAIN glances over the CURMUDGEON'S shoulder at LUSTY who is admiring the gyrocopter.
GYRO CAPTAIN => er... possibly. The FERAL KID steps forward, holding his hand out stiffly to MAX. MAX hesitates, then shakes it briefly. The KID laughs - be finds this hand shaking-business hilarious. As MAX moves on to the pyramid workshop, the FERAL KID follows in his footsteps, mimicing his squeaky, stiff-legged gait.
black-on-black below. => The FERAL KID comes into view in the foreground, climbing along the pipes. The KID is softly humming a tune - approximating the first few notes of "Happy Birthday". On the workshop floor a small siphon pump is transfer- ring fuel from a 44 gallon drum into the black-on- black's fuel tanks. MAX is re-arming the booby traps - connecting a string of wires and fuses to the gas tank caps. His utility belt and jacket are off and he has laid his personal. effects on a nearby work bench.

PAPPAGALLO => I don't have time for thanks. You know what you did out _ there and what it means to us. Come with us, MAX. Drive the tanker. MA:. continues to work - muffling the four exhausts by plugging them with rags.
MAX => We had a contract. I did my job, I got my car and I got my gas. End of story.
PAPPAGALLO => It doesn't have to be - we'll make a new contract. I can offer you a chance to rebuild your life, I can offer you a future. The CURMUDGEON breaks in, excited.
CURMUDGEON => You gotta come. Look! He produces a grubby souvenir postcard pack which bears the heading:
CURMUDGEON => This is where we're going. Two thousand miles away. "Bloody paradise. Fresh water... plenty of sunshine... nothing to do but breed... MAX starts to go back to his work. PAPPAGALLO takes him by the shoulder.
PAPPAGALLO => What are you looking for out there? How long do you expect to survive, scavenging day to day? You're no different than them. He points in the direction of the Marauders.,. ..,vultures, maggots. Don't you see? There is a better way! MAX flares at him, angry:
MAX => Yeah. I tried it once! Now forget it, 'cos I never get involved. I'm leaving. I leave tonight. PAPPAGALLO is about to reply when a scream echoes through the camp. They all turn to look: the men working on the prime mover are running towards the battlement, An ominous drumming begins in the Marauders' camp.
PAPPAGALLO => You see! That's the alternative! Men feeding on men. MAX goes back to work. The GYRO CAPTAIN slips his arm around LUSTY'S shoulder.
GYRO CAPTAIN => I know you're afraid darlin'. But I'll let you into a secret, sweetheart. I'm afraid too. He squeezes her tight. She caresses his hand.
workshop area. => He drags it.across the compound, passing the MECHANIC'S TEAM working in a shower of sparks on the prime mover. The MECHANIC looks up:

GYRO CAPTAIN => I just want you to know that I don't agree with them, He indicates the people in Pappagallo's tent.
GYRO CAPTAIN => I don't think you're a coward. A bit stupid - but not a coward, Where else you gonna find what we 've got here? Food... fuel... clean women. MAX goes back to work, putting the finishing touches to the ramp.
GYRO CAPTAIN => Men, too, if that's your inclination. Jesus! All we've got to do is get away from that Humungus. With you driving the tanker we can do it. I know you can. I saw you out there. Stay with us Max. Drive the tanker. MAX gets up, snaking his head.
MAX => I haven't got time to explain. Just believe me - I've got everything I want. The CAPTAIN starts to interrupt but MAX cuts him short.
MAX => Good luck tomorrow. I hope you make it. Sc. 106. Cont.

It's the FERAL KID, He grins and tumbles through the passenger's window. He grabs hold of MAX'S hand, shaking it. The FERAL KID laughs, settling in to the seat. The car continues to roll forward. Sc, 108, Cont.
MAX => Get out. Scat! Go back. The FERAL KID looks at him, puzzled, then throws his head back, howling. MAX stops the car, looking round, nervous. The first light of dawn appears on the horizon. MAX turns to the FERAL KID:
MAX => You're a fine kid, but you can't come. You've gotta learn - don't get close to people. It can churn you up... The KID can't understand a word, so just grins. MAX thrusts his hand into his back pocket and produces the hurdy-gurdy. He shoves it into the FERAL KID'S hands, opens the door and pushes him out.
Humungus encampment. => The rapid burst of power fires the four plugs out of the exhausts. The big engine roars.

GURDY => Then, beyond the KID, coming into clear focus, he sees the prime mover attached to the tanker. The tanker now sports a 'cow-catcher' on the front, armour-plating on the bonnet, steel aprons on the wheels and a barbed wire net along each side. MAX'S vision clears. He sees PAPPAGALLO-on the catwalk addressing the CAMP PEOPLE. MAX drops his bead back and looks to one side: a bloated faces stares back at him. The QUIET MAN, is lying unconscious on a stretcher next to him. MAX lifts his head urgently and looks around. He realises that he is in the bread van. The canopy has been removed and his stretcher is supported by a collection of 44 gallon drums.
PAPPAGALLO => We're going to use the tanker and the two assault vehicles to punch our way out of here. If I'm right, they'll all go after the tanker. That'll give the rest of you a chance. 124. INT. BREAD VAN. DAY. 12x. MAX is sitting up, binding his leg tight with bandages, clipping on his metal knee brace. PAPPAGALLO Split up. Go as hard as you can. Two hundred miles north there's a bridge.

PAPPAGALLO => It's defensible, We can refuel there.
PAPPAGALLO => But! Only give us 'til sunset. If we haven't made it by then, keep going! PAPPAGALLO swings down off the catwalk, heading for the cabin of the tanker. The meeting breaks up - the CAMP PEOPLE moving to take up their positions on the various vehicles.
MAX => I'll drive the tanker... Everybody stops, turning to look at him. MAX is staring at PAPPAGALLO, swaying slightly, hands clenched,
MAX => Until you're clear of trouble... The CURMUDGEON breaks in:
