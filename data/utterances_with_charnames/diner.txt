SHREVIE => We didn't want to mention it. Surprise for Eddie. Shrevie's car follows in the taillights of Boogie's car. Fenwick's car is nowhere in sight.
BETH => Elyse's mother is very upset with Eddie. They picked out a yellow and white motif for the wedding. You know, like we did, tablecloth, napkins, maids-,of-honor. Anyway, Eddie objected. He wanted blue and white because that's The Colts' colors. Refused to give in.
SHREV7E => Yeah, so?

(CONTINUING; YELLING => out the window) See you guys later at the dine=.
CUT TO => Exi . -DINER - NIGHT The diner is one of the typical late S0's metal and glass structures. Almost deco in design. Cars are parked in front, including Shrevie's Hudson Hornet. CAXR4 PANS to a car parked over in a corner. TABACX has his truck open, filled with pants. A few guys are going through the goods as Taback tries to wheel-and- deal.

CUT TO => INi . DINER - NIGHT The diner is the late-night hangout... made up of a mixed bag crowd. Around one side, the aluinun siding SALE'S?. N guys in their 30s and 40s. Some HIGH SCHOOL ERS , only there on the waekends, and the, Boogie-S?irevie c_cwd. (The guys in their early t,?enties .) One thing is quite apparent. There are no girls present, except WAIT=S.SSES. T h at is the unspoken rule. NO DATES. Eddie, Shrevie and Modell sit in a booth. They all eat french fries and gravy.
EDDIE => You can't compare Mathis to Sinatra. No way.
SHEEV IE => They're both great singers.
EDDIE => Yeah, but you can't compare them. Sinatra is the lord. He's big in movies, everything.
MODELL => That's true. There's hardly any blues in movies. Just sidekicks.
EDD IE => C'mon, they could've put Mathis in 'From Here to Eternity.' They had blues in the war.
S'DREVIE => Mathis didn't come around until after that movie.
EDDIE => Are you telling me Mathis could've played Maggio? Is that what I'm hearing?

EDDIE => You maniac. FE:l I cK Kidding. Said she wanted to see me again. Liked aye, sort of.
EDDIE => Emis? Fenwick nods. He sticks out his pinky. Eddie gabs it with his pinky. Therefore it's the truth.
BAGEL => The guy's canvassing the neighborhood, and I notice he's stopping at the brick houses. He's trying to sell aluminun siding to the brick house owners.
BOOGIE => Don't remember.
BA GET- => ?'oa,. nobody bets two thousand and forgets.
BOOGIE => Okay, so? What's the point, Bagel?
BAGEL => Where you getting C40 thousand? You haven't got a pot to piss in.
'BOOGIE => Game's a lock.
BAGEL => Nothing's a lock. You want me to call it off? As a favor to your father, may he rest in peace.
BOOGIE => Bagel, get in. Trust me. Boogie Walks off. - -
BAGEL => Kids today. Nobody's interested in making an honest buck.

-BOOGIE => Presley.
EDDIE => Presley. You're _ick.
BOOGIE => Did I tell you guys I'm taking out Carol Heatrow tomorrow night?
FENWICX => You're taking out Carol Heatrow?
EDDIE => She is death.
B00GIE => Only go for the best.
SHREVTE => Cold.
BOOGIE => What's the bet she goes for my pecker on the first date?
FEN ICK => The only hand on your schiong is gonna be yours.
BCOGI_ => Bet me t-wen t-r .
FE4 LCK => You got it.
EDDIE => I'm in.
MODELL => Me, too.
SHREVIE => I'm in, but we need validation.
BOOGIE => All right. I'll arrange it.
-- -- => --A .our -engine- prop -comes into-vi view asTt rates its approach. The plane sails inches off the runway and then touches down.
ANOTHER ANGLE => to include Shrevie's Hudson Hornet, as it backs up, moving toward Billy. As it approaches, the back door opens .
BILLY => (thr awing his
BAG INSIDE) => You g' ys ara too much. Hcw' d you know I was ccain' in this mcFn._nc?
BOOCIE. => C'mcn, get in. Billy climbs in and slams the door shut. The Hudson pulls away.
BOOGIE => He's crazy is t-,hat he is. With the Shrevie here it was just nuts, but Eddie? T?:at's lunacy.
SHREVIE => Mari age is a? right. I'm not complaining.
BOOGIE => Not complaining. Uz u, sounds good.
BILLY => What? He's getting mar_ied on New Year's Eve.
BOOGIE => Not until she takes the test.
BILLY => Boog, what are you talking about?
BILLY => Are you shitting me?
BOOGIE => You know Eddie and the Colts. Very serious. The test has something like a hundred and forty questions. True and false, multiple choice, short answer.
FENWI CK => Oral cast. He doesn't want any cheati:,g.
BILLY => What happens if she fails? He's going to call. it off? Is that what I hear?
SHREVIE => rte swears to 1.tThe was supposed to be two months ago. Elyse keeps delaying. Heavy pressure.
FENWI K => Her plan could be, though, to stall until the last minute. Then if she falls, it doesn't matter. It's a fait accompli. Kno.t's tied.
BOOGIE => Fait accompli, my ass. He walks.
B ILLY => I doubt it. I tell you, it was a real surprise. No call. Just a note. Why do you figure, all of a sudden?
BOOGIE => Botton line? Elyse turns into -- - Iceland and Eddie's not the type to look elcev.here. Eddie goes for the marriage, and Elyse is back to being the Bahamas again.
SHREVIE => You dgn' t know that for sure, Boog.
BOOGIE => I'm a good judge of human nature.
CUT TO => The Hudson is parked out front. The morning light is just beginning to break. THROUGH iZ WINDOW we can see the - guys sitting in a booth eating. They are obviously having a good time. Shrevie takes a sip of coffee. Billy says something and Shrevie puts his hand to his mouth. Coffee pours through his fingers and down his chin.
AF => -And hat' -was-nothing -compared to what happened in Miss Nathan's class.
SHREVIE => This is great. I was there.
BILLY => Had her for Art class. Third floor. She catches mq talking. Tells me to see her after class. I jumped up from my seat and started screaming 'I can't take it - any morei You're always picking on met I can't stand itt' Then, I ran to the window, opened it and jumped out. She freaks and faints dead away. She forgot the gym roof was six feet below.
SHREVIE => ----Her eyes closed. -- She swayed for - - a moment and then toppled right over her high heels. Out cold. I was hysterical.
BILLY => The topper was the Principal. Donley comes in and sees Miss Nathan on the floor. He doesn't I .ow what to make of it.
SERE VIE => Than She=an, remember him? Normally a shruck, but ne stands up and says 'Snhrhhh, she's sleeping, Mr. Donley.' T h an he sees Billy in the window.
B ILLY => I said, 'I'm sorry I'm late, sir, but my bus broke dour.. Is Miss Nathan up yet?' All the guys laugh.
BOOGIE => You're missing the action now, Billy. Half the guys are a: U. of B. night school. A Lot of fucking laughs. 
FENWI CK => - : Cto?BiiIy) - A Masters in Business. That's the lowest. Billy shrugs his shoulders as if to say, "What. can I - tell you?"
BILLY => Who's there?

Boogie's eyes glance toward Fenwick. Fenwick shakes his. head and mouths "Bet's off. Not fair." Boogie nods "Yes. Troy and Sandra walk the beach. The romantic score swells. The yotzia- audience is caught up in this screen love affair. Carol reaches into the- popcorn box once again. Suddenly she screaws. She bolts up from her seat and races up the aisle. The audience iq alive with chatter, war, wondering what has happened. Boogie turns to Fenwick and smiles. Then he heads ue the aisle after Carol.
BETH => (as she watches Boogie racing up the aisle after

BOOGIE => Hold on, hold on a second.
CAROL => You'are disgusting!
BOOGIE => I know it was terrible, really horrible and all, but it was an accident.

Everything settled down and I got caught up in the picture. Forgot all about it. Then when I saw Sandra wearing the bathing suit in that cove scene, you know, it just popped right out and went right through the bottom of the popcorn box. The force of it opened the flap. Carol stares at him, wondering if ? s is telling th= Lrut`:. The beautiful "Su_.^ -per Place Love Theme" GROWS LCCSER for a few seconds ar som=one comes through the doors and heads for the candy counter.
