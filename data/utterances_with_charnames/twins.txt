WERNER => On his 35th birthday, I decided to tell Julius Benedict the truth about himself...
WERNER => It wasn't that he was the product of a scientific experiment.
WERNER => An experiment designed to produce a physically, mentally and spiritually superior human being. I explained that to him when he was two years old.
Werner. => WERNER And it wasn't the complexity of Julius's parentage. He knew that unlike other little boys, he didn't have just one, but half a dozen fathers, all very distinguished men.                                   *
WERNER => Nor was it about the extraordinary woman chosen to be his mother...
WERNER => Julius had long lived with the tragic news that she died giving birth to him.
&                                                               & => 8                                                               8   *
WERNER => His mother gave birth to another baby...
JULIUS =>  I have a brother?!!! CUT TO:
WERNER =>  He was sent to an orphanage in Los Angeles. At the same time I brought you here to the island. Julius isn't listening.    His eyes shine.
JULIUS =>  I have a twin brother?!! (for a moment, chews on his right thumbnail) What's his name? WERNER Vincent. JULIUS  Vincent -- Every time I loved something I called it Vincent -- I called my first computer Vincent! (suddenly spins; starts off) I have to find him!
WERNER =>  You've been here since you were a baby -- you know nothing of America -- JULIUS I know it is the cradle   of democracy and the land   of the free; besides, I speak   twelve languages -- I'm sure I   can get a job. 
JULIUS =>  It was an honor to study under you, Master. Without warning, the Oriental tries to strike Julius in the face with the side of his hand, but Julius blocks the blow.
ORIENTAL =>  Ahhh, always on guard. You have learned well, Julius-san. Julius gives a last hug to Werner.
JULIUS =>  I was just thinking, maybe my brother Vincent is married.
JULIUS => Well, if a woman loved my brother enough to marry him, she might have a sister who'd feel the same way about me. That often  happens with twins, you know. WERNER Julius -- please -- don't get your hopes up. Your brother doesn't even know you exist.
JULIUS =>  Of course he does. I've always known there was something missing in my life! And deep down, I'm sure Vincent feels the same way! He's probably just like meeeee!
to. => VINCE You sleep well, honey? CARLA Mmmm... like a baby.
VINCE => Me, too. I love this new mattress. It's soft but it's hard at the same time. And I love this new clock.
VINCE => The curtains are the key to the whole thing. They're colorful... they're brilliant... they're... great curtains. CARLA  You were great last night, Vince. VINCE  Naaaw... (putting his arm around her) I think we're going to be very happy here. Suddenly we hear a DOOR downstairs as it OPENS, and a man's voice drifts up the stairs:
VINCE =>  What's he doing back so early?
MAN => Carla? You gonna cook me some breakfast or what?
CARLA => Be right down, sweetheart! Vince checks his appearance in a dresser mirror, straightens his Armani suit, brushes his hair, pulls it into a fashionable ponytail. He cuts a stylish figure. Noticing an expensive gold lighter on the dresser top, he covertly pockets it.
CARLA => Hurry up!   I gotta make breakfast!
VINCE => You're wonderful, Carla. Your husband doesn't deserve to kiss your feet.
VINCE =>  ... 'everything's going my way'... CUT TO:
smile. => VINCE Carla, what a joy to look at you.  
PARKING." => VINCE Stop with that horrible song, you know how I hate birthdays; they're worse than Christmas. Al presents him with the gift. VINCE  For me?
AL => Carla and I figured, since you were always admiring mine, what the hell...
VINCE => A lighter, just like yours.   I don't know what to say, Al.   I'm all choked up.
CARLA =>  Hello -- the Greco residence... sure. Who may I say is calling... Mr. Burt Klane? Vince, it's for you --
VINCE =>  Good morning, Mr. Klane. I hope you're having a wonderful --  Yes -- no problem -- I have it. Yes. Today. Of course. 'Bye. Vince hangs up. AL What are you doing talking to a loanshark? VINCE  That's part of my good news -- You know that money I picked up from the Jaguar we boosted. Well,                      * I put the money in the stock                           * market. I got this incredible                          * tip.                                                   * CARLA Oh no.                                                    * VINCE I can't lose. Ever hear of P.V.T.                         * Industries? Probably not --                               * Secret takeover bid -- 
VINCE => A very special stock -- and it was such a sure thing -- I borrowed another 20 grand from the Klane                      * Brothers. CARLA  You borrowed from a loan shark to invest in the stock market? VINCE On margin -- And as of last night I was ten thousand ahead.

NEWSCASTER => ... that Wall Street's suffering its worst single-day's losses since October '87. Hardest hit                       * were Federated Broadcasting, down $18, Waverton Data, down $24 and P.V.T. Industries, down $32. Analysts speculate that even blue chip stocks will not remain immune to...
AL => You are having one shitty birthday, Vince.
CARLA => Don't you think you're doing this too often?
VINCE => I'm a desperate man.                                    *
AL => Level three.   Stall 25. CUT TO:
OWNER => We're in a recession -- Everything's tough -- you want to try someone else -- no hard feelings. VINCE  Forget it. OWNER You okay, Vince? You seem a little worried.
VINCE => Me? I laugh myself to sleep every night, and I never sleep alone. I'm doing great! The Owner smiles and turns. Vince continues counting the money, nervous as hell. Now -- CUT TO:
JULIUS =>  'Put on your red dress, baby 'Cause we're going out tonight...' A few passengers turn and look back at --
JULIUS => seated in the rear, still in his peasant garb, the bamboo suitcase resting on his lap. He has his headphones on and is singing along to the music, his eyes closed and his head bobbing. JULIUS  'I better wear some boxing gloves, In case some fool might want to fight.'
JULIUS =>  Sorry -- I've never heard this music before -- I love it.                             * She sighs, leans over him, fastens his seat belt, while Julius gazes down at her ample cleavage.
STEWARDESS => The captain wants us to buckle our seat belts because we're expecting a little turbulence.
JULIUS =>  Thank you, Betty Lou. 
JULIUS => Actually, I'm a horticultural botanist, a mathematician, and a philosopher.
STEWARDESS => Right.    And I'm a brain surgeon.
HIJACKER =>  Nobody   moves, or else we're gonna have a   serious draft in here. (turns to another stewardess) Get the   captain. I want to discuss   our final destination.
JULIUS => turns to the terrified elderly woman beside him who's clutching a hardcover Bible in her lap. JULIUS  Excuse me, ma'am.
arm -- => CUT TO:
HAND => retrieving the hardcover Bible from the floor and --
JULIUS =>  His mischief shall return upon his own hand, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own head -- Psalm 7:16. In front now, there is a lot of activity as various pass- engers hold the Highjacker, almost arguing over who's in control. Julius looks at them a moment, puts on his headset, closes his eyes and is soon bopping away to the music. CUT TO:
BARTENDER => It's him.    He's back.
warmth. => VINCE Marnie! How are you?        Is your                       * sister around?                                            *

VINCE =>  I am so sorry for all the miserable things I've done to you.
LINDA => Like what? MARNIE Linda!
VINCE =>  I didn't come here for a loan, sweetheart. I came to say goodbye. * It's not safe for me here. People are trying to kill me. Vince starts to rise but Linda pulls him back down. LINDA What did you do, Vince?
VINCE => I got involved in the stock market. LINDA  I promised Marnie I wouldn't give you money. Vince takes Linda's hand between his and stares into her eyes. LINDA Don't look at me like that... Don't do that with your eyes... I shouldn't even be here with you.
VINCE =>  You are here and so am I, Maybe millions of people go by, But they all disappear from view, And I only have eyes for you... Linda. I only have eyes for you. LINDA  That is so beautiful. How do you make up that stuff? You're such a poet.
VINCE =>  It's the baby Klane -- I gotta get the hell out. Burt Klane strolls to the middle of the room, then suddenly turns and faces Linda. BURT KLANE Where's the little shit?
LINDA =>  You gotta be more specific, considering our clientele.
BURT KLANE => Benedict.
LINDA =>  He wouldn't show his face around here. Right, Marnie? She looks down at -- VINCE
back door. => MARNIE (enjoying calling him names) Who, Vincent?                                           * 
BURT KLANE =>  Okay -- enough. CUT TO:
it quickly. => BURT KLANE This is only four thousand --
VINCE => The rest is invested.     We're gonna make a fortune.
LINDA => I hope this helps -- Please don't hurt him.
BURT KLANE => There you go -- (he counts Linda's money) -- Another thousand -- Okay -- This nice lady just bought you a day Vince -- I want it all -- Twenty- thousand -- this time tomorrow.                        *
VINCE => Twenty -- ?   But I just paid -- Just as he opens his mouth, Vince is elbowed again. BURT KLANE That's just the interest.    The                       * twenty's the principal.                                *
VINCE => That was the most wonderful birthday present anybody ever gave me -- LINDA It's your birthday?   Why didn't you tell me? VINCE  I can't take the kindness.    It gives me the shakes. LINDA You'll tremble plenty before we're through, Vince Benedict. They kiss.
JULIUS =>  ... How wonderful...
JULIUS =>  What an amazing country. CUT TO:
BIKER #1 => ROARING up beside Julius, smiling ingratiatingly. BIKER #1 Got a light, pal? JULIUS Sorry, but I don't smoke... pal?
BIKER #1 =>  Looking for something for your girl friend?
JULIUS => I... don't have a girl friend. Do women really wear these things? BIKER #1 If you're lucky.  You from out of town?                                     * 
CASE HANDLE => Julius's hand holds fast to it.    Then -- CUT TO:
BIKER #2 => As his mouth drops open as we -- CUT TO:
JULIUS => just sort of standing there, no big deal, not much effort showing on his face as Biker #2 begins to slowly rise into the air as he and his cycle are about to be parted and then --
RIDERLESS CYCLE => ending its trip as it collides with a storefront and collapses on its side, MOTOR still ROARING but no movement anymore and -- CUT TO:
CYCLIST #1 => stunned, going to his unconscious partner. BIKER #1  What the hell did you do? Julius calmly kneels beside the still form. He puts his case down, and his hands move expertly across the prone figure.
JULIUS => I did nothing, the pavement was his enemy. CUT TO:
JULIUS => I would say -- a concussion -- a mild shoulder separation, and ribs four to seven are cracked.
Julius rises. => JULIUS Get him to a hospital.
thru                                                                   thru => 47                                                                     47   *
COP => Your vehicle's in a handicapped zone. Vince immediately hunches his shoulder and affects a limp. VINCE So?    Do I look normal to you?
COP => You don't have a 'handicapped' sticker on your windshield.  Driver's license, please. CUT TO:
COP => You've got over 200 outstanding parking tickets, Mr. Benedict. And you just had your birthday? Well, your driver's license just expired -- Happy birthday.                               * 
JULIUS => So, this is where my brother grew up. I'm glad he had so many friends to play with.                                     *
fondly. => JULIUS And that's where he must have slept.
MOTHER SUPERIOR => How did you know?
JULIUS => It's the one I would have chosen. It's next to the fire extinguisher. In case of a fire, I could have given the alarm, and saved the other orphans. MOTHER SUPERIOR We've only had one fire at St. Charlotte's. Vince Benedict started it, we like to think by accident.
JULIUS => Tell me about him. Was he a good athlete? Did he like chess and poetry?
MOTHER SUPERIOR => That's odd... the contents of his file are missing. Julius picks up the photo -- a 13-year-old boy leering up at an attractive young nun.
JULIUS => This is him?   He looks happy --                        * MOTHER SUPERIOR  He should -- that's Sister Maria,                       * his biology teacher.
JULIUS => I always liked biology. MOTHER SUPERIOR So did Vincent. He disgraced Sister Maria, who had to leave the order. Then he stole all the money from our library fund and ran away.
JULIUS => But I have to find him.   Where do you think he might be?
MOTHER SUPERIOR => Jail. A man of his character could only be in jail. You're full of goodness, Julius -- I pray that you never find him.
Seven Footer. => SEVEN FOOTER (to Vince who is scowling at him) What're you lookin' at? VINCE At you, you jerk. The Seven Footer rises angrily to his full size. Vince moves right in on him -- he may be going through a bad patch, but make no mistake, Vince is tough.
VINCE =>  World International Athletics                           * Representation. Vincent Benedict -- President. I coulda got you a no-cut contract so you wouldn't have to heist T.V. sets for a living --

JULIUS => trying to fight his excitement, watching as the prisoner moves toward him -- -- then past him.
GUARD. => 
JULIUS =>  Vincent... CUT TO:
VINCE => listening, somewhat amazed.    Who is this loony?
JULIUS => ... Dearest Vincent... Vince glances quickly around to see that no one is listening. 
JULIUS => I know you don't know who I am, but -- I came halfway across the world --
VINCE =>  -- Whoa. I still got another six hours to pay the money back. You                         * tell those crummy Klane brothers that harassing a man when he's already in the slammer is beneath even them -- JULIUS (overlapping -- they do this a lot) -- I don't know any Klane brothers. I'm your brother, Julius. VINCE  Huh?    Again? JULIUS I don't know any Klane Brothers.
VINCE =>  Yeah.   Go on -- I got that part.
JULIUS => My name is Julius -- I'm your twin brother.
VINCE =>  Obviously -- the minute I sat down I felt like I was looking in a mirror. JULIUS We're not identical twins.
VINCE => I wouldn't be too sure. 
VINCE =>  I'm in fast company here --  Listen, you get me outta here, I'll be whatever you want, best friend, brother, nephew, niece, grandma...
VINCE =>  Just don't ask me to bend over --
JULIUS => I have some more money -- VINCE You do?
JULIUS => I am happy to help you, Vincent. You're my brother. I love you.
VINCE => Julius -- look -- ease up on the love talk or I'm gonna be tossing my cookies, all right? JULIUS Tossing cookies, that is more slang? VINCE Just gimme your wallet, okay? As Julius sweetly hands it over --
JULIUS => I know what you're thinking?
VINCE => No, you don't.
JULIUS => You're thinking that this whole twin business is what you call 'bullshit.'
VINCE => Actually, I was thinking I'm going to need some more money -- to put gas in my car --
JULIUS => You can take some more money -- VINCE I can? JULIUS Sure...
VINCE => We're brothers -- right? Julius tries to drape an arm around Vince's shoulder. Vince gives him a look. Julius drops his arm. TIME CUT TO:
VINCE => They arrest you, they put you                             * behind bars, they fine you and                            * then they hide your car.                                  *
JULIUS => That's --  -- your car, isn't it? CUT TO:
VINCE'S MUSTANG => Which is what Julius is pointing at.
VINCE => Yeah --   How'd you know that was my car.
JULIUS => We're twins! 
JULIUS =>  I'm so excited -- we'll go to museums together, discuss philosophy together, read books together -- play chess together -- VINCE -- Get lost together -- And on that, he GUNS his CAR the hell away, leaving Julius standing there.
JULIUS => Deserted, alone in the sea of cars.
AL => You guys must be going to Hawaii, huh? Catch that good surf.
GARFIELD => Something like that. The two men just stare straight ahead, uninterested in conversation. Al hands the driver a ticket.
AL => There's plenty of space on level four. The Cadillac accelerates up the ramp.
OUTSIDE CADILLAC => as the men get out, lock the car, wipe off the door handles, and then head for the elevator.
CUT TO => A60   EXT. HOLLYWOOD OFFICE BUILDING - ESTABLISHING - DAY             A60

MOVER => Taking back the furniture -- you're six months behind.
MISS BUSBY => I tried to stop them, Mr. Benedict -- VINCE It was time to redecorate anyway. The PHONE RINGS -- Miss Busby drops to her knees beside it. MISS BUSBY  Vincent Benedict, Incorporated -- Sports agent, artist's representative -- import/export -- automobile sales, rentals, and leasing -- wholesale patio furniture -- How may I help you?  Oh, hi.  It's Al. As she hands him the phone.
VINCE =>  Miss Busby -- Stacy -- this is a transition period for the corporation -- Why don't you take a few days off. MISS BUSBY  ... Aah -- all right. Whatever you say, Mr. Benedict... 
VINCE => I hope you got some good news,                         * Al --                                                  *
AL =>  Brand new Caddy on level four. CUT TO:
VINCE =>  Great, I'll be right over. Vince drops to his knees in order to replace the phone into its receiver. He then scrambles up, straightens his suit, heads for the door, making sure his pony tail is perfect. CUT TO:
MORRIS KLANE => Time's up, Vincent -- Got the money?
VINCE => In agony, on his knees. It hurts to breath.       He finally manages to look up at the giant --
VINCE =>  Did you hit me yet? 'Cause I didn't feel nothin'.
MORRIS KLANE => He grabs Vince again.
MORRIS KLANE => You gotta understand something, Benedict -- I like my work. He pulls  Vince groggily up and this time he's going for Vince's  face. He takes his time setting Vince up, getting  his chin at just the right angle. He's concen- trating  on his work, so he doesn't pay much attention to the fact  that the elevator door has opened behind.
JULIUS =>  These are most unfriendly acts you are committing.
MORRIS KLANE =>  What? 
on talking. => JULIUS You moved too soon. Klane spins and aims a karate kick at Julius's head. Julius coolly ducks it and sends Klane crashing into a wall. JULIUS An important rule in a crisis                         * situation -- negotiate first, attack last. You never negotiated. You don't know what kind of enemy I am.
MORRIS KLANE => Who are you? JULIUS Vincent's brother. VINCE  We're twins.
MORRIS KLANE => You're firewood. 
JULIUS => -- And I have no respect for those with no respect for logic. You're a very stupid person.
CUT TO => VINCE Watching as Julius picks up Klane with both hands and lifts him a foot up into the air, holding him there for a pause.
JULIUS => As he heaves Klane across the corridor into the open elevator Klane crashes down hard just as the door slides shut and... CUT TO:
VINCE => Tell your brother 'He messes with me, he messes with my whole family!'
VINCE =>  I like it when you hit people! JULIUS I hate violence. VINCE But you're so good at it. We ought to go into business together. You could be a boxer and I'll be your manager. JULIUS I don't think I could fight for money. VINCE No problem. You do the fighting, I'll keep all the money. JULIUS  I'm worried about you, Vincent. They reach Vince's Mustang and get in.
JULIUS => How much money do you owe? Don't lie -- we're twins, I can feel your pain.
VINCE =>  Why do you keep saying that? We're not twins, we're not brothers, we're nothing, and you're only in this car because I could use a little protection these days --
VINCE => I don't know where my head is -- I forgot I promised this friend of mine -- Sammy -- I'd pick up his car at the airport -- do me a big favor, okay? Drive this car back from the airport for me. JULIUS I'd love to. Julius reaches into the glove compartment, takes out the car manual, begins speed reading it, running his index finger down the center of each page. VINCE What are you doing with that finger? JULIUS Learning to drive. Vince isn't sure what's going on at this point. Now Julius studies Vince's shifting moves, the way his hands work the steering wheel. Now he's back to the manual. Now he's staring at Vince. Vince and Julius's heads are both in motion now -- Julius's from the book to the wheel, Vince's from the road to Julius's finger. As their heads keep turning -- CUT TO:
JULIUS => What's the matter?
VINCE => That dopey Sam -- He did it again. Forgot to leave the keys... A lot of handicapped kids are gonna be really disappointed...
JULIUS =>  Handicapped children?
JULIUS => Maybe we should try to open it ourselves... Vince raises his eyebrows in mock surprise.
VINCE => You think we should do a thing like that?
JULIUS => Of course -- it's for the children... CUT TO:
VINCE =>  I saw a guy from the auto club do this once... The door locks suddenly pop up in unison. VINCE Whaddya know?    Beginner's luck!
VINCE => As he takes a breath, opens the door, scoots inside --
JULIUS => When the back end is raised to an angle greater than 45 degrees, a mercury switch activates the automatic cutoff system. The alarm's computer thinks the car is being towed away and shuts off. VINCE No shit... It's beginning to dawn on Vince that there may be more to Julius than meets the eye.
A pause. => Now the Mustang comes along, Julius at the wheel. He drives terribly, stopping and starting -- jerking along. Julius suddenly puts his foot on the gas and roars past Vincent. CUT TO:
JULIUS =>  Vincent Benedict's car.  Vincent! Where are you?
VINCE => There's a supermarket up ahead. Take your foot off the gas and very -- very -- very gently put it on the brake. JULIUS The brake -- right.
JULIUS => The brakes worked just fine! VINCE Lemme tell you something about America, Julius -- nobody likes a smart-ass.
LINDA => There's only one Vince Benedict. He's a force of nature.
LINDA => I know that -- Geez, you don't think I know that -- ?  It's so cute, the way he thinks he's tricking me. Anyway, what's wrong about other people's songs? Some guys tell you dirty jokes. It just proves that Vince has a romantic soul. CUT TO: MAGAZINE RACK Adjacent to the express checkout lane where Linda and Marnie now join the line. Julius picks up a Playboy and begins speed-reading it. His eyes widen at what he's reading, and seeing, and when he reaches the centerfold he audibly gasps. MARNIE Excuse me. She reaches past Julius to take a copy of Cosmopolitan. Julius drops the Playboy, which falls open on the ground, with the centerfold revealed. Flustered and blushing, he bends down to retrieve it, watched by Marnie, who can't take her eyes off the sheer beauty of his physique.
MARNIE =>  She's not bad... JULIUS  I'm sorry. I had no idea these magazines had things like that... inside them. Julius tries to stuff the centerfold back into the maga- zine, but only manages to crumple it. Linda and Marnie exchange a look. 
VINCE => That's right... They all turn and look at Vince, who's pulled his cart up behind them. JULIUS  My twin brother, Vincent. Linda and Marnie, stunned, look from Vince to Julius. VINCE  God you look beautiful in this light. LINDA Vince... ?   I didn't know you had a brother.
JULIUS => You all know each other? VINCE Julius, meet Linda and...  Her charming sister, Marnie.
JULIUS =>  Sisters? MARNIE  Twins? CUT TO:
VINCE =>  Goodbye girls, see you soon.
JULIUS =>  Goodbye girls, see you soon. And he guns off too -- only in his excitement he's gone into reverse.
JULIUS =>  I've only been drivng for an hour. Now he follows Vince. MARNIE Why do I think I'm going to see him again?  Like maybe tomorrow.
JULIUS => Linda is your girl friend, isn't she?
VINCE => Yeah.   Kind of. JULIUS Is Marnie your girl friend, too? VINCE Marnie! Marnie hates my guts. She seemed to like you.
JULIUS =>  She hardly knows me. A beat.
VINCE => That's the best way --   women love men who are mysterious   and devious. It keeps them on their   toes -- makes them excited you   know what I mean? JULIUS No.
VINCE => You do like women, don't you?
VINCE => Now correct me if I'm wrong. You're a virgin, aren't you? JULIUS That's private.
VINCE =>  He's a 230-pound virgin.                              *
VINCE =>  Alright! Alright! I got your food. Yes! 'Liver and Cheese,' 'Chicken Giblets,' all your favorites, Julius. JULIUS You named your cat, Julius?
VINCE => The secret to take-out veal Parmesan is adding a little extra cheese. I know you're probably used to growing your own vegetables and spearing fish in the lagoon, but here on the mainland we just nuke it!
VINCE => Dinner is served!

PARKING SPOT => It's definitely empty. CUT TO:
WEBSTER => He looks at the Cadillac key.    Clearly, he is not happy at the turn of events. CUT BACK TO:
JULIUS => He won the Nobel Prize.
JULIUS => I think it's important we try to find our fathers. VINCE You mean, all those geniuses who contributed to the... (making a jerk-off gesture) ... Sperm milkshake?                                   * JULIUS Why are you being so immature about this?                                            * Vince throws down his napkin. VINCE Do you know how many times I've heard stories like this? It's every orphan's fantasy: 'My real Mom and Dad were rich and beautiful, but there was a mix-up at the hospital and I got switched with another baby... But one day there's going to be a knock at the door and there they'll be with open arms, crying... "My darling! My treasure! We didn't know! How can we make it up to you?"'  I'm telling you this for your own good, Julius. It's a crock. Vince goes over to a trunk, rummages in it, comes up with a dusty mouldering folder from which he removes a yellow- ing piece of paper. 
JULIUS => Dear Sister Anderson, your request for orphans benefits for Vincent Benedict has been denied. According to our files his mother did not die during birth. We have a current address for her at 172 Canyon Glen Drive, Los Angeles. Vincent's case seems to be one of simple abandonment and as such he is inelligible for aid. Vince snatches the paper back.    Julius stares at him, just stunned. VINCE That's right, Julius, she abandoned me. JULIUS This letter was written thirty                      * years ago. We were five years old                   * -- Our mother... didn't die when we were born... (staring at Vince now) You've known all this time where she was and you never contacted her? VINCE  I don't know about your momma, Miss Perfect of 1952, but my momma was a slut, and if she's still alive, I hope she's in a lot of pain. She dumped me once -- no way she gonna get a chance to do it again --
JULIUS => Vincent, if they lied to us about Momma for all these years, maybe they lied to her, too. We must find her, we must check this address.                                            * 
VINCE => Julius -- slow down -- I've got no time for this. You go hunt down                       * Mom, I've got a cash flow problem                     * to deal with.
VINCE =>  What! BURT KLANE We haven't forgotten about you, Benedict -- You better have our money tomorrow morning. Or else. VINCE Or else what? Suddenly, Vince's    living room WINDOWS EXPLODE in a burst of GUNFIRE. Vince     and Julius hit the floor and try to shield themselves    from the SHATTERING GLASS. The sound of a CAR SQUEALING    away outside the window. JULIUS Everyone seems so angry in America.
GARFIELD => The tests on the lower temperature gaskets look great.
LARSON => Looks like an easy weekend.
chair. => GARFIELD Who are you? WEBSTER  I'm Webster, it's okay. CUT TO:
GARFIELD => on the sound of the name.      He looks at Larson.   A beat.        * LARSON  Christ, man, you were never                            * supposed to come here.
GARFIELD =>  The deal was we were never supposed to meet. You're supposed to be...
WEBSTER => Driving that Cadillac to Texas? (holds up his gloved hands) Got my driving gloves, got my driving glasses, got my hat... but no car.
GARFIELD                                 * => The car was there! The merchandise was in the trunk! Your instructions were on the cassette!  
GARFIELD => This is bullshit! The car was there. LARSEN That's right. The parking attendant thought we were off for Hawaii.
WEBSTER =>  The parking attendant? GARFIELD He liked the car. We'd put on those damn loud shirts so we'd look like tourists -- LARSEN He asked us if we were going surfing. He was a jerk.
WEBSTER => You know, I just realized that in                     * twenty years of service no other                      * client has ever seen my face. GARFIELD * I don't think that's a problem. Webster pulls out a silencer-equipped pistol and puts a bullet in each of their foreheads. They lie very still and very dead.
Secretary. => WEBSTER Thanks for everything, guys. I'll see what I can do about those Laker tickets.  Yeah, I'll tell her.
vaguely familiar. => 
JULIUS => She was my mother. Granger looks at the photo, then at Julius. GRANGER You're Mary Anne's son? GIRL  Isn't that you, Grandpa?
GRANGER =>  Why don't you go help your grandma with lunch, honey?
GRANGER => They told your mother that you died at birth...
GRANGER => I guess you could say I'm your father...
JULIUS => One of my fathers -- GRANGER (wistfully studying photo) 'Mary Anne Benedict'... I haven't said her name aloud for over 30 years. She was the love of my life.  The times I've wondered what would have happened if I'd married her... JULIUS Why didn't you?
GRANGER => She turned me down. Said she was afraid to have children. She took it real hard when they told her you died. She even stopped painting. Did you know she painted? JULIUS Until yesterday I didn't even know she might still be alive... Who told her we died?
GRANGER => 'We'? JULIUS I have a twin brother, Vincent. GRANGER There's two of you? She never                            * knew that, either.
GRANGER => Mitchell Traven. He supervised the experiment for the government. 
JULIUS => I'll go see him. GRANGER Watch out for him -- he's kind of a dickhead, if you know what I mean. JULIUS No, I don't -- but I'm learning.
trunk. => The trunk is filled with a sleeping bag that might contain a dead body. Vince unzips the bag, sees some kind of giant engine part. He tries to lift it out -- It won't budge.
VINCE =>  Sorry -- the car's been promised for a kid's charity. BODY SHOP OWNER Okay, four grand. As Vince starts to drive away: BODY SHOP OWNER  Okay -- Six thousand -- that's as high as I'm going... CUT TO:

VOICE => Beetroot McKinley talkin'.
McKINLEY => Who's cloggin' up the line?
McKINLEY                                  * => Well, bring it to me, son, and let me enrich you. VINCE It's the amount of enrichment I want to talk about.
tough S.O.B. => McKINLEY Don't try and renegotiate with Old Beetroot, son -- CUT TO:
VINCE => Look, Beetroot -- if we can't renegotiate we wither and die. I'm not delivering any goddam Cadillac without knowing for sure I got twenty for my cut.
Beetroot.    Exploding. => 
VINCE => I guess twenty seems a little high to you. I'm a reasonable guy -- I'll take fifteen -- McKINLEY Listen to me, you poor excuse for a warmed over turd, a deal's a deal -- VINCE -- But -- CUT TO:
McKINLEY => Don't 'but' me, the deal is five -- VINCE I can do better than five here. McKINLEY (on his feet -- in a fury) If you can do better than five million dollars, take it!                               *
his life. => 
VINCE =>  Beetroot?
McKINLEY => What? VINCE I'll see you in Houston -- after all, fair is fair. (staring at the written $5,000,000) I'll just have to find it in my heart to live with your offer... Vince hangs up, jumps up and screams with joy. He puts the cassette in his pocket, crumples up the piece of paper, and sky-hooks it into the waste basket. VINCE Five million dollars!
WEBSTER                                     * => Your boss at the lot told me you                          * were on duty when the Cadillac                            * clocked in. Now what's his name?                          * AL Okay... His name is Vince Benedict.
WEBSTER => That's certainly a beginning.
CARLA =>  I'm really disappointed in you -- ratting on your best friend. 
AL => All three years.
CARLA =>  And you never told me until there was a stranger listening? Shit, what about my reputation? WEBSTER Where can I find Mister Benedict?
AL => I'm not saying. WEBSTER Let me get this right -- You're protecting the weasel who's been                        * screwing your wife for the past three years. AL He's my friend.
WEBSTER => Well, I guess I'll have to beat it out of you --
CARLA => Stop -- I'll tell -- He lives at 1622 Westridge Place -- He's got an office at the corner of Highland and Hollywood.
AL => Thanks for saving me.
CARLA => I always loved you, Al.  
WEBSTER =>  No one's gonna believe this one.
VINCE =>  'Going back to Houston, Houston, Houston...' Vince tosses the items into the back seat of the Caddy, just as Julius jogs up the driveway and collapses against the Caddie door. He's red in the face, completely drenched with sweat, gasping for breath, having run all the way from Bel-Air. VINCE  Jesus! JULIUS  Vince, the most amazing thing has happened.
VINCE => You scared the living shit out of me -- JULIUS I met one of our fathers. He told me of a man in New Mexico who probably knows where Momma is. 
JULIUS => She didn't abandon you -- she didn't even know you were born! VINCE  Awww -- that's terrible. Vince removes Julius's hands, slides him away from the door, and opens it.
JULIUS => And she was told that I died! VINCE Look, Julius, I'm in kind   of a hurry. Sammy wants me to    take the car to Houston. Much    bigger bucks when you raffle for   charity in Houston. Julius takes the map from Vince, looks at it.
JULIUS =>  -- New Mexico is on the way to Houston.
VINCE =>  A lot of places are on the way to Houston. I'll be back in a few days. Stay in my apartment. Run up my phone bill. Throw wild parties. Take advantage of me.
JULIUS => Vincent, we have to go see this man Traven in New Mexico! VINCE No we don't.
VINCE => You know -- you're right. This is fate -- destiny -- But there's no way I'm gonna drive for 1500 miles with you smelling like that --
JULIUS =>  You're right -- I'll take a shower -- be right back --
VINCE =>  Why does everybody have to like me so much? Vince gets out of the car and, although it kills him, tries to put on a happy face for Linda. LINDA Happy birthday, Vince. VINCE Oh please -- It's not my birthday anymore -- MARNIE Happy birthday, Vince.   Is Julius around?
VINCE                                    * => He's inside.                                            * Marnie walks into the house.                                         *
LINDA => You were going somewhere -- you weren't even going to say goodbye --
VINCE => Okay, okay -- look, you can't tell anybody this -- not even your sister -- but I'm onto something so huge it gives me a rash just thinking about it. LINDA Like what?
VINCE => I got something in here --  -- I don't even know what it is -- that's worth a fortune! LINDA  A fortune! That's great!
NEIGHBOR => Never sleep with that man. Never loan him money. And never believe a word he tells you -- that's free advice. She slams the door shut.
LINDA => Vince...? VINCE  I borrowed a cup of sugar from her once... 
LINDA => I am because if you say 'no' one more time --  -- I'll tell everybody you're hiding a fortune in your -- VINCE (a hand over her mouth; he's beaten and he knows it) Okay, okay. Just don't let on to Julius. He thinks we're going to look up our ancestors, like in 'Roots' or something.
JULIUS => 'Put on your red dress, baby, 'cause we're going out tonight...' She puts the photo back as the sound of SHOWER STOPS. Julius emerges from the bathroom, clutching a towel around his waist, and freezes at the sight of Marnie. JULIUS  Marnie -- excuse me -- I was just taking a shower.
MARNIE =>                                      * I heard you singing -- I baked some cookies for you.
MARNIE                                    * => I guess it was a dumb idea.                             * 
MARNIE => Oh -- don't mind me. She turns her back to him.
JULIUS => I hope Vince doesn't mind if I borrow one of his shirts. MARNIE (while eyeing Julius through her compact) Just don't try wearing his pants. They both turn as --
LINDA => throws open the door, with a big smile on her face. LINDA Guess what? Vince just invited us all to go to New Mexico and Texas. Vince comes in behind Linda, trying to conceal his exasperation.
JULIUS => That's a great idea, Vince.
CUT TO => 112    OMITTED                                                         112 thru                                                                   thru A114                                                                   A114
BURT KLANE => Open up, Benedict! I know you're in there!
WEBSTER =>  Your owner seems to be a very popular fellow these days.
WEBSTER => Howdy.
BURT KLANE => Who are you? WEBSTER It's not really important, is it? I wanted to feed the cat before I left. Webster starts for the door. Morris blocks the doorway, cutting Webster off. BURT KLANE I asked you a question.
BOB =>  We're the Klane brothers. That's Burt and Morris -- I'm Bob. WEBSTER Interesting genetic pool. You're looking for Vince Benedict, right? The brothers all nod.
WEBSTER => Am I Vince Benedict? Morris stares hard at him, shakes his head.
WEBSTER => So what's the difference who I am? 
WEBSTER =>  Your brothers seem to have a problem with their feet. (dangerously to Morris) It could be contagious.
WEBSTER =>  Have a good, good day.
by. => CUT TO:
LINDA => I think that's good.
MARNIE => I really hope so.
VINCE => This ought to fit you. Julius removes the shirt he borrowed from Vince, who pretends to be horrified at the sight of Julius's huge muscles. VINCE Whoa -- get away from that window! There's women and children out there!  What is wrong with you?
JULIUS => What? VINCE You allergic to something? JULIUS No.   Why? VINCE What are those bumps doing all over your body? You're all swelled up. You look like you're about to explode. 
MARNIE => Julius... As he walks past, Julius slaps her five. JULIUS Let's rock and roll. He opens the car door and climbs in. VINCE  It's his first T-shirt.
MARNIE => Good luck.                                               *
MARNIE => See you later.
VINCE => See if you can get us a room with a king-sized bed, okay? Linda smiles at him, and winks. Julius, misunderstanding the sleeping arrangements, leans out the window.
JULIUS =>  That's not necessary. I always sleep on the floor. Vince looks askance at Julius, then pulls the car away. HOLD ON Linda and Marnie, gazing curiously after them. CUT TO:
VINCE => Now promise me something.  
TRAVEN => I don't know who you are and I                            * don't know what you're talking                            * about. Now get the hell out of                            * here before I call security.
VINCE =>  Well, that's that. On to Houston. He leads a stunned Julius down the corridor, towards several armed security guards.
JULIUS => He's lying!
VINCE => Keep your voice down. This place is crawling with security --                              *
JULIUS => For the first time in my life, I am -- (looking for the word) -- pissed off!
JULIUS => I'm going to make him tell us the truth...
VINCE => No... CUT TO:
TRAVEN => You turned out just like I thought you would, Vincent. What did you do, escape from prison? Vince stops dead, shell-shocked.
VINCE => ... How did you know my name? 
VINCE                                     * => Holy shit.   It's all true.                              * CUT TO:
LABORATORY DOOR => Chained and padlocked.      Traven unlocks it, pulls off the chains.
TRAVEN => This room was sealed as soon as your mother gave birth.
VINCE => gazes at the "blender" we saw Traven demonstrating in 1953.
VINCE =>  This must be where you made the milkshake... 
TRAVEN => We weren't making milkshakes.  We were making the most fully- developed human the world has ever seen.
VINCE => But instead of just one perfect kid, Mom had two of us -- way to go, Mom. TRAVEN Wrong. The embryo split in two, but it didn't split equally. All                        * the purity and strength went into Julius. All the crap that was left over went into what you see in the mirror every morning. VINCE  Whoa -- I'm the crap? JULIUS It's not true, Vince. VINCE No, I want to hear this.  I'm left-over crap? I'm no good?
JULIUS => He's wrong.
TRAVEN => Just look at him --
VINCE => You tellin' me I'm a side effect!?!
JULIUS =>  Tell us where our mother is...                         * dickhead!
TRAVEN =>  Whispering Pines... it's an artists colony... two hundred miles north of Santa Fe. JULIUS If you're lying to me.  I'll be back. Julius tosses him aside.
VINCE => My life just got flushed down the toilet. JULIUS You're wrong, Vincent. Your life's just about to begin. VINCE I'm genetic garbage.
VINCE => * I know this is a touchy subject                      * for you, Julius. But the fact is,                    * we don't look the same -- we don't                   * act the same, we don't talk the                      * same -- we don't dress the same.                     * JULIUS I know.
VINCE =>  So how come if we're the same, we're so damn different.                             * JULIUS We had six fathers, Vince. We're different parts of a lot of different people. Vince is starting to get interested again. VINCE Yeah? JULIUS And remember, I was taken to a beautiful island, protected, educated, loved, given every opportunity to grow, to dream, to create. But you had none of that.
JULIUS => You had nobody. Nobody to love you, nobody to trust you, nobody to encourage you. All life taught you was that the only person you could count on was yourself. Tears begin to well up in Vince's eyes.
VINCE => A family?   You really think so?
VINCE => With like Thanksgiving dinner? And Christmas trees...
JULIUS => ... and a real home where you'll always be welcome. VINCE Always? JULIUS Even when you've been bad.
JULIUS => Is this necessary? VINCE I'm not introducing you to my mother dressed like some goatsherder from Albania. You need some new clothes.
SALES CLERK => Can I help you, sir?
JULIUS => Do I look okay? VINCE You look better, put it that way. We got to do something about the way you walk. You're moving a tad stiff, Jules. Ever see                         * Frankenstein? JULIUS I read the book. VINCE That's not gonna help. You got to walk like you're moving in time to music. I'm not talking about military marches now, I mean Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Archie Bell and the Drells and a couple of white                   * guys.                                              *

Indicating glasses. => Julius puts on sunglasses, snaps his fingers, tries to ape Vince's moves while Vince appraises him.
JULIUS                               * => Am I cool now? --                                  * VINCE                                 * Mr. Ice.                                           *
MARNIE/LINDA => Wow!
JULIUS =>  We know where to find our momma! VINCE Everything Julius said was true. I'm the product of geniuses! LINDA I always knew that.
VINCE => Of course, but it's nice to make it official. JULIUS                                      * Tommorrow we're going to finally meet our mother. VINCE                                       * And tonight we celebrate!
bothering him. => JULIUS  Vince, you've got to help me -- I've never been out on a date before... what should I do?
VINCE => Talk to her, buy her some drinks, dance with her. Girls like to dance.
VINCE => I guess you haven't done that before either.
VINCE => Well -- forget all that disco shit, everyone's seen it. When I really want to romance a girl, I waltz with her.
JULIUS => You dance with them?                                     *
VINCE => It turns them to putty in your hands.
VINCE => He shoves a chair out of the way, making a little room. VINCE Okay, come here, put your feet by my feet -- JULIUS  -- Thank you for this, Vince -- VINCE (a pained look on his face) -- I said put your feet by my feet not on my feet! -- Julius looks at his brother, then self-consciously takes his hands. VINCE I'll lead, you follow. Okay, one, two, three, turn...  ... put your arm here -- you're breaking my fingers -- you're not wrestling a boar 300 miles south southwest of Fiji -- don't clench your teeth -- Vince begins to take Julius through the steps slowly at first, then as Julius gains confidence they begin to sail round the room, and we -- CUT TO:
VINCE =>  Well, you've learned to waltz. Now it's time to introduce you to the wonderful world of getting shit-faced. CUT TO:
JULIUS => Did you know they had beer in ancient Egypt?
MARNIE => Er... no...
JULIUS => Actually it was invented by the Assyrians, but the Eygptians were the first people to perfect the malt fermentation process. LINDA You sure know a lot about beer.
MARNIE => He knows a lot about everything. Julius polishes off the bottle, belches.
VINCE => Well, we're going to change all that -- aren't we, Marnie? Julius, embarrassed, looks over at Marnie, who's smiling sweetly at him. JULIUS Can I ask you a question?
MARNIE => Anything... JULIUS Am I shit-faced yet? Linda, surprised, does a spit-take with her beer.
MARNIE =>  You're getting there. Vince gets to his feet. VINCE Please excuse me -- my back teeth are floating.
JULIUS => I better see if mine are, too. Julius takes off after Vince.
JULIUS => You do that too, huh? 
JULIUS => I don't think she really likes me.
VINCE => Piece of cake. You're nervous 'cause it's your first time. Perfectly natural.
JULIUS => Were you nervous? VINCE I was twelve and she was a nun -- that's real pressure. They both finish at the urinals and begin washing at the sink. VINCE I got to admit it, Jules -- since I met you, life is getting better all the time. Julius, a little smashed, can't hide his feelings.    He grips Vince by the shoulders.
JULIUS => For me, too, Vince! Sometimes I'm so happy, I want to pick you up and hug you! Julius starts to do so, just as another man enters.
VINCE => Hey, cut it out! Not in here! Julius releases Vince, who clocks the other man's reaction.
VINCE =>  Go easy on the beer, okay?
BEETROOT => Lookin' forward to it.
BEETROOT =>  Sorry, Webster, looks like I'm doin' business with someone else. WEBSTER  I'd do the same thing. You want the delivery, it's not your problem who delivers. (handing him a card) If you ever need me, my answering service forwards all messages. And he's gone. BEETROOT (handing card to bodyguard) Put this in my personal file. (staring at the door) God, I love a professional...

Julius. => LINDA Did you tell anybody we were coming to Santa Fe? MARNIE  Well, I phoned work and told them we wouldn't be coming in for a few days... Oh, I forgot to tell you -- we've been fired.
LINDA =>  Let's go to the ladies' room. MARNIE But we just went. Linda takes Marnie by the hand, just as --
BURT KLANE => Hello, girls -- Do you mind if we sit down and enjoy the music with you? CUT TO:
BURT KLANE => This has gone way past a simple case of loan deliquency. BOB KLANE We don't like getting shot.                                *
VINCE => What are you talking about?    We didn't shoot anybody. 
JULIUS => What do you want?
BURT KLANE => We want to take Vince out to the parking lot and kill him. A long beat.
VINCE => That's kind of drastic, don't you think?
MORRIS KLANE => Let's go. JULIUS  Don't touch him. BURT KLANE * This is not your problem -- you                          * don't want me to hurt these lovely ladies, do you? He pushes his gun into Marnie's side. MARNIE  -- Ow!
JULIUS => You moved too soon... BURT KLANE What? JULIUS The second rule in a crisis situation:
MORRIS KLANE =>  He's starting that funny talk again...
BURT KLANE => Meet my cousins.  Get these jerks outside.
been attacked. => Without stopping, Julius whips his arms together in front of him bringing Sam and Dave into painful contact with each others' head. They, too, are now out cold. Vince uses this opportunity to stomp, with all his might, on the toe of Morris who's busy watching Julius dismantle his relatives. Morris screams and lets go of Vince, who runs to the nearby pool table, grabs a cue and slams it over the head of the now hobbling Morris. All five Klanes are out cold. VINCE How many of those... rules do you have?
JULIUS => Quite a few. They were formulated by a Kendo swordsman in the 17th century, but their philosophical underpinnings can be applied to many other areas of life. VINCE I bet.
VINCE => Uh... we got cable TV, a fully stocked bar, free ice -- we're in great shape. JULIUS Where you going? VINCE I thought I'd just go and tuck Linda in for the night.
VINCE => Maybe read her a bedtime story.  Don't wait up for me.
the door. => JULIUS What a day, Vincent, we visited our birth place. We bought new clothes. We danced the waltz. We get into a fight -- We've got this great room.  It just doesn't get any better than this.
the room. => VINCE Oh yes it does. TIME CUT TO:
JULIUS                                    * => Hi.                                                     *
MARNIE => Hi -- Vince and Linda want to be                        * alone, so I'm afraid I'm going to stay here. Which bed should I take? JULIUS  Either... I always sleep on the floor.
MARNIE => Good night. JULIUS Good night. Julius puts the blanket and pillow from the other bed onto the floor between the two beds, then shuts off the other lamp. Silence... MARNIE This mattress is awful. Getting out of bed, she pulls the blanket and pillow with her as she steps over Julius, who tries not to look up, and gets into the other bed. MARNIE Sorry.   Good night.
JULIUS => Good night.
MARNIE => This mattress is just as bad as the other one.
JULIUS => Good night.
JULIUS => Are you cold?
MARNIE => It's alright. JULIUS No, please, take my shirt.      I'm               * baking. Julius strips it off and hands it to her. She puts it on and pulls the blanket over her shoulder. Again she shivers. JULIUS You still cold?
MARNIE => Just my legs.
JULIUS => Well, I could give you my...
MARNIE =>  Thanks.
JULIUS => Anything else? MARNIE I'd love a glass of water.
JULIUS =>  Right.
to her. => 
MARNIE => Thanks.
MARNIE => Oh, great!
MARNIE => Do you mind if I share your blanket? -- Mine's all wet.
JULIUS =>  No -- that would be okay. They both lie down under his blanket.      Silence... MARNIE Could we switch sides?   I like to sleep on the left. JULIUS Sure. She starts to roll over Julius, then pauses directly above him and looks him dead in the eye. MARNIE Can I ask you something for a change? JULIUS Anything.
MARNIE => Do you like me? I mean, even a little bit?
JULIUS => I... I'm crazy about you, Marnie. But there's something about me you ought to know.
MARNIE => What?
JULIUS =>  I'm a virgin. 
VINCE =>  -- Eighteen -- nineteen -- LINDA You sick or something? VINCE Julius gave me a few pointers --  -- Seventy-five -- seventy-six -- I don't need to exercise, but Mom's gonna see me for the first                       * time in thirty-five years, I wanna look my best. LINDA She'll love you whatever you look like. VINCE I know she will -- I have that effect on people --  -- One hundred and forty-three --                      * one forty-four --                                      *  -- I just hope she's not too disappointed in Julius -- he can't help how weird he seems at the start --
VINCE => Hey -- I sleep great every night --  -- what if she's disappointed in me? LINDA  C'mere. VINCE  Five hundred.  Don't want to overdo. He goes into her arms. LINDA If she's disappointed in you, then she's a fake -- who could want more from a son? VINCE  You're right.  I couldn't do this without you, Linda.
LINDA => I know. That's why, when we get back, I think we should move in together. VINCE  Whoa!   Move in together? LINDA I'm not saying we have to    get married or anything, and    it's not about me wanting to keep    an eye on you, either.  I just want to live with    you.
VINCE => I'm no good at playing house -- I'm grouchy in the morning, cranky in the afternoon, moody at night -- 
VINCE => Why don't we sleep on this, okay? I mean, I've got a big day tomorrow.  It's gonna be great -- taking my best girl to meet my mom.
LINDA => Am I really your best girl? VINCE There's nobody else, Linda, not anymore. LINDA There better not be, because...  'I only have eyes for you...' They kiss.
MARNIE => Are you sure you've never done this before?
JULIUS => I think I would have remembered...
VINCE => Good idea. One bunch from me, one from Jules.
MARNIE => And one from us -- Julius smiles happily at Vince's thoughtfulness.
JULIUS =>  You mustn't always think of money.
VINCE =>  You got me wrong -- I'm just saying it's nice Mom's loaded -- that's a worry she won't have to have in her old age. Julius smiles at Vince and rings the bell. A MALE CUSTODIAN answers the door -- friendly but very firm.
CUSTODIAN => Can I help you? 
VINCE => We've come a long way. I can assure you she's going to be very happy to see us. CUSTODIAN I suggest you write a letter to the Benedict Foundation stating your business. The Custodian politely closes the door in their faces. VINCE                                     * A foundation?
CUT TO => 
JULIUS =>  Well, don't just stand there.
LINDA => Introduce yourselves.                                   * As they take a step in the direction of the painter. WOMAN  Hey!
GARDENER => Should you be here? VINCE  That depends on how you feel personally about trespassing. GARDNER (umamused; to Julius about Vince) Is he always funny like that? JULIUS  We'd like to see Mary Ann Benedict please; is she here? 
VINCE => Please don't do that -- look -- this isn't one of your average everyday situations -- she's our mother is the thing.
JULIUS => We're her sons.
VINCE => Twin sons. GARDENER -- You're comedians -- VINCE We're kind of a surprise.
GARDENER =>  I'll bet you are -- follow me.
her easel. => VINCE (whispering to Julius) We were right --
JULIUS =>  -- It is her --
JULIUS =>  We thought that that woman --
VINCE => -- Is Mary Ann?
GARDENER => No -- This is an artist's colony; there's a lot of painters. 
GARDENER => You can't really own something like that view over there, or that sunset, can you?
VINCE =>  No, of course not.
JULIUS =>  I can't wait to meet her. GARDENER This way, please. The Gardener ushers them towards a door in the garden wall. She opens it, politely stands back, letting them go through it. They turn back to look at her. GARDENER Mary Anne Benedict never understood why people wanted to buy her paintings. But for a brief period they were considered valuable. She used the money to buy Whispering Pines so that young artists would have a place to work.
GARDENER => She never wanted to be famous. She just wanted to be left alone.
JULIUS => May I ask you a question?  Why do you keep referring to her in the past tense? GARDENER Because she passed away, some time ago.
VINCE =>  Can we get the hell out of here?
PAINTER => What was that all about? GARDENER These real estate developers won't be happy until they turn this place into a golf course. PAINTER Now they're climbing over the walls? GARDENER They're shameless. They'll try anything.  Those men claimed to be my twin sons, if you can believe that. It was really quite disturbing. PAINTER Oh, Mary Anne, I am sorry...
GARDENER => It's alright... You get over things.                       *  I did have a child once, but he died                       * at birth... CUT TO:
VINCE => Do I look like a young artist to you, Linda? MARNIE  Vince, all she meant was -- VINCE  I know what she meant. And I know why she's here, too. It's got nothing to do with my mother and everything to do with money. LINDA You know that's not true.
VINCE =>  Bull-shit. Julius, who's been quiet and distant throughout, suddenly intercedes. JULIUS Take it easy, Vincent.   It's not her fault. VINCE You hear that, everybody? The                          * creature from the black lagoon                         * just put in his two bits. I                            * should have my head examined for listening to you in the first place -- deal-of-a-lifetime opportunity and I'm driving around looking for a dead mother.
JULIUS =>  All I wanted was to make us into a family.
VINCE =>  Family, my butt. There's no family here. There's just me and three losers -- I'm leaving. 
MARNIE =>  He dumped us in the middle of New Mexico.
JULIUS => We'll be fine. And maybe he'll be better off alone.
LINDA => You don't know -- he's got something worth maybe millions in that trunk -- he could get himself killed delivering it. JULIUS He's been getting out of trouble all his life, he's good at it. MARNIE He may need you.
JULIUS =>  I don't know much anymore -- on the island I was smart. Here, I've only made things worse. MARNIE Don't you realize you could make things a lot worse if you don't do something. (gently; close beside him now) Julius -- you're still very smart it's just you're not thinking so well right now -- on account of what you found out at Whispering Pines -- but you're not alone, you know -- I mean, you live long enough, everyone's mother dies...
he's thinking. => CUT TO:
VINCE => Okay, Beetroot -- It's time. I'll be there tomorrow -- where do we meet and trade?
JULIUS =>  Don't worry, Linda. I found him once, I'll find him again. MARNIE Be careful...                                              *
JULIUS => He turns away. CUT TO: MARNIE watching.
Hollywood. => CREEP  Got a light, pal?                                      * Julius, without breaking stride, turns his head, looks at the Creep. JULIUS  Don't fuck with me... pal. The Creep falls back.
BEETROOT => Step away from that car, Mr. Benedict.
VINCE => I thought we had a deal here.
BODYGUARD =>  This is it. VINCE This is what?
BEETROOT =>  You come here alone, unarmed? You're just a fool who stole a car, aren't you? It's a new, low-                      * cost fuel-injection system for                         * jet engines -- worth a fortune to                      * the company that brings it to the                      * market first.                                          * (ruthlessly; to                                 * Bodyguard) What are you waiting for?
VINCE => Five million dollars --
BODYGUARD =>  You wanna count it? VINCE I trust you.
WEBSTER => emerges from the shadows with a powerful pump action                * shotgun. He opens the Caddy and pushes the dead                     * Bodyguard off the horn. Beetroot has a hole in his head, as well.
around. => WEBSTER  All I want is the money, Benedict. Just give me what's mine and you can go back to stealing cars and screwing your best friend's wife.
WEBSTER => FIRING at the sound. He can't see Vince but he pours his fire at the window Vince broke -- large chunks of the              * BUILDING EXPLODE off wherever Webster fires.                           *
WEBSTER => Pack it in, Vince, you're only wasting time -- I don't give a damn about you, just the money -- He's reloaded during this -- moving forward as we...
WEBSTER => moving in on the shattered window.     A bit irritated.
WEBSTER => Vince, if you don't cut this horseshit I may have to hurt you.
JULIUS =>  Leave my brother alone!
JULIUS => I've got the money. WEBSTER (gun trained on Julius) Well don't be shy --  -- come on down. CUT TO:
VINCE => No way... this is bullshit...  Julius, you putz.
WEBSTER => Just exactly who are you? JULIUS Vincent's twin brother -- we're in this together. WEBSTER Keep your hands that way. JULIUS Don't be nervous -- I hate violence and I never carry guns.
VINCE =>  Goddam ESP-psycho-voodoo bullshit...
JULIUS => I needed something to read on the airplane.
WEBSTER =>  Yeah, well your flying days are over...
VINCE => Put the goddam gun away -- you're a multimillionaire. CUT TO:
VINCE => hands held high, appears, stands beside Julius.
VINCE => I am never going to forgive you for this.
JULIUS => You were going to get killed. I tried to distract him so you could escape.
VINCE => Because, thanks to you, I'm now not only a godamn psychic, I've got this disease called a conscience! JULIUS Nobody ever said being good was easy.
VINCE => How am I going to survive out there? What are my friends going to think?
JULIUS =>  You haven't got any friends. WEBSTER Just what are you two talking about? VINCE  Butt out, okay? This is family stuff, we're squabbling, it's personal, just take the money and go sit in the lap of luxury somewhere. Try Brazil. WEBSTER  I doesn't work like that, you might talk to people -- (aiming the rifle now) Who wants it first. JULIUS Shoot him.   This whole thing is his fault.
WEBSTER => Whatever you want.
JULIUS => pulls a gun from his sleeve and blows Webster's weapon out of his hands. Webster screams in pain, clutching his hand, dancing around. VINCE  You can be an irritating pain -- but sometimes you come in handy. -- Where'd you get the gun? JULIUS From the dead man in the car. VINCE  You should have checked if he had a gun, chump. WEBSTER He said he didn't believe in them. JULIUS  I lied. VINCE  Ooooh -- you lied? JULIUS I had to. Vince beams with deep fraternal pride.       Then he turns to Webster and snatches the case back.
VINCE => Looks like you messed with the wrong people, wise guy.
WEBSTER =>  But your luck just ran out. A stream of gas is pouring out of the drums that Webster punctured whilst he was shooting at Vince. It runs in a broad stream across the warehouse floor, right beneath Julius and Vince's feet. Webster is holding his cigarette out, ready to drop it in the fuel and incin- erate them.
WEBSTER => Drop the gun and give me back the case, or we're gonna have ourselves some barbecued Benedict. Julius drops the gun and Vince slowly hands back the case. Webster smiles and backs off down the stream of gas, still holding out the cigarette. He stops at the very edge of the building. WEBSTER Well, I guess this is goodbye. He raises the cigarette, ready to throw it. JULIUS Wait a minute. Webster looks up.
JULIUS => You've forgotten something. Webster grips the case tighter.
WEBSTER => I don't think so.
JULIUS => The third rule in a crisis situation.
JULIUS =>  Duck. Suddenly the load hanging from the boom of a nearby crane smashes into Webster's back, and then dumps on him, burying him in rubble. VINCE  Duck?  Duck? You are developing real style, Julius.
JULIUS => drapes his arm around Vince as they walk towards the unharmed attache case full of money. JULIUS You came back for me.
VINCE => Yeah, yeah, yeah. JULIUS I always knew you would. VINCE You're my brother, right?  We're family, right? JULIUS Thank you, Vincent. VINCE  We're a rich family, right?
JULIUS => We're a good family. I'm sorry, Vince, but we have to return the money. 
JULIUS => -- Including us -- think how much                       * better you'll feel when it's out of our lives --
VINCE =>  -- I won't -- I won't feel one bit better -- I'll never feel better, not if I live to be... oh no --                         * As the sound of POLICE SIRENS get LOUDER we -- FADE TO BLACK.
PAINTER => I think you'd better read this...
VINCE => Linda, I -- LINDA What the hell are you doing here? VINCE You wouldn't answer     my calls or my letters, so I...     Look, I made a terrible mistake     and I apologize and I want to tell     you that I'm a changed man. Linda is almost buying it, but then -- LINDA How did you get in here? VINCE Well, there was a window in the back that --
LINDA =>  Typical. She walks past him, approaches her door, puts in the key. Vince follows, speaking softly, his sincerity absolutely genuine.
VINCE => All I ask is for another chance. I know I probably don't deserve it, but --
LINDA => You're right, you don't deserve it.
VINCE => I had to break into your apartment, but --
LINDA => Vince, they're beautiful. VINCE So, do you forgive me? Linda hesitates.
LINDA => Yes, but... VINCE But? Vince looks at her, understands. VINCE You mean, that matter we talked about once and never really resolved.
LINDA =>  What matter is that?
VINCE => The matter of you and me living together.
LINDA =>  What about it?
VINCE => Your place or mine?
JULIUS => Look at this, Vince -- proposals from the Red Cross, UNICEF, the World Health Organization -- we should only have clients who do humanitarian work.
VINCE => Just as long as they pay -- we're not running a charity, you know.
VINCE => Come in!
words. => MARY ANNE It's so incredible I'm not even sure which one of you is which. VINCE AND JULIUS
MARY ANNE => You see, I didn't believe you, I mean who would believe a story like your story -- crazy -- They lied to me all these years... And they lied to you... But you found one another ... And you found me... Please -- God -- one of you say something. VINCE  Momma? Mary Anne nods. JULIUS  Mamma?
JULIUS => Watching them. Now there are tears on his face, too. He goes to them, gently puts his arms around them, lifts them both up in to the air, cradling them. They're laughing.   They're crying.   They're holding each other.
MARY ANNE => I just can't get over how alike they are... The three women all turn and gaze affectionately back at --
well. => Vince and Julius both yawn simultaneously.
JULIUS => They kepp you up all night again, too? 
JULIUS =>  I think you need your diaper changed.  What a surprise -- so do you.
diapers. => VINCE  Not you, too -- It's not a competition, you know. They both start pushing their strollers again. JULIUS Just think what we'd be like if we'd been raised together.
VINCE => Now that's a scary thought. They both yawn simultaneously once again.
