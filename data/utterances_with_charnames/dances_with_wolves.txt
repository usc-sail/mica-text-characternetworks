SURGEON 1 => Is this the last one?
SURGEON 2 => God, what a mess... at least there's no gangrene.
SURGEON 1 => There will be if it doesn't come off.
SURGEON 2 => Well I can't saw if I can't keep my eyes open.  Let's coffee up... he can wait a few more minutes.
PEPPER => Lieutenant... izat you?
PEPPER => What're you doing here lieutenant?
DUNBAR => This is where I belong... this is my outfit.
PEPPER => You went to hospital?
DUNBAR => It was no good... what's going on here?
PEPPER => Better come to cover lieutenant... those boys are shooters.
PEPPER => What's goin' on here... seems to be the question alright... you could ask the major but he don't know. He's busy tryin' to figger out how come the officer's mess run outta peach ice cream...
PEPPER => General's come up to see the show but all he knows is there ain't no show...
PEPPER => We started a balloon up but they shot her down fore she was ten feet off the ground... so nobody's made a run either way. It's been a stand- off all damn day... and now... the major, he's lookin' at the general and he's thinkin' I better do somethin', and you know what that means...
PEPPER => They're 'sposed to be beat up just like us but everybody knows that Tucker's men are tough as cobs. I sure don't wanna die out there with them cows.
PEPPER => Some of the boys are sayin' that if we ain't gonna fight we could just settle the whole business with a little high stakes poker. Wouldn't that be a sight... a bunch of fellas sittin' in the middle of this field drawin' cards...
RAY => Tucker!
AIDE => What is it sir?
TIDE => Looks like a suicide.
CONFEDERATE => Come on you son of a bitch -- you won't make it a second time...
DUNBAR => Alright by me.
DUNBAR => Forgive me Father.
DUNBAR => Don't take off my foot.
GENERAL TIDE => You rest easy son... you'll keep you're foot. As God is my judge, you'll keep it.
GENERAL TIDE => Bring up my ambulance...
AIDE => Sir?
GENERAL TIDE => Bring up my ambulance. And bring my surgeon with it. We've got an officer who's worth something lying here.
DUNBAR => The strangeness of this life cannot be measured. In trying to produce my own death, I was elevated to the status of a living hero.
DUNBAR => Where can I find Major... Fambrough?
ELGIN => Turn right... all the way to the end of the hall.
FAMBROUGH => Lt. John J. Dunbar.
DUNBAR => Sir?
FAMBROUGH => Lt. John J. Dunbar.
DUNBAR => Yes sir?
FAMBROUGH => Indian fighter, huh?
DUNBAR => Excuse me?
FAMBROUGH =>  Your orders say you are to be posted on the frontier. The frontier is Indian country. I quickly deduced that you are an Indian fighter.
FAMBROUGH => I did not ascend to this position by being stupid.
DUNBAR => No sir.
FAMBROUGH => It says here you've been decorated.
DUNBAR => Yes sir.
FAMBROUGH => And they sent you out here to be posted?
DUNBAR => Actually sir, I'm here at my own request... I want to see the frontier.
FAMBROUGH => You want to see the frontier?
DUNBAR => Yes sir... before it's gone.
FAMBROUGH => Such a smart lad coming straight to me.
FAMBROUGH => Sir Knight, I am sending you on a knight's errand. You will report to Captain Cargill at the furthermost outpost of the realm... Fort Sedgewick.
FAMBROUGH => My personal seal will assure you safe passage through many miles of wild hostile country.
DUNBAR => I'm wondering sir, how will I be getting there?
FAMBROUGH => You think I don't know?
DUNBAR => No sir, it's just that I don't know.
FAMBROUGH => Hold your tongue.
FAMBROUGH => I'm in a generous mood and will grant your boon. You see that peasant... he calls himself Timmons... he leaves this very afternoon for your Fort Sedgewick. Ride with him if you like... he knows the way. That is all.
FAMBROUGH => Sir Knight...
FAMBROUGH => I just pissed in my pants... and nobody can do anything about it.
FAMBROUGH => Noooo, noooo...
ELGIN => It's alright Major.
SERGEANT => Leave him alone lieutenant... he's cracked.
FAMBROUGH => Nooo, nooo...
ELGIN => Don't sergeant.
FAMBROUGH => Are you deaf fool. I said I'll have my crown this instant... this instant!
ELGIN => Let's have the pistol.
SERGEANT =>  Don't do it.
FAMBROUGH => The king is dead... long live the king.
DUNBAR => Were it not for my companion I believe I would be having the time of my life. He is quite possibly the foulest person I have ever met.
DUNBAR => We have been gone four days now and still we have seen no signs of life. Only earth and sky.
DUNBAR => How far do you make the fort?
TIMMONS => Far.
DUNBAR => How far?
TIMMONS => Forty or fifty miles, maybe... what's the big hurry on Sedgewick?
DUNBAR => It's going to be my post... my home.
TIMMONS => You ain't hard to please, I'll say that.
TIMMONS => Look yonder.
TIMMONS => Somebody back east is sayin'... "why don't he write?" Stupid bastard.
CARGILL => Corporal Guest... Corporal Guest... Corporal Guest. Corporal Guest, you don't have to talk to me... just please come out.
CARGILL => It's the end... assemble the men in front of my quarters.
CARGILL => You hate me... but I feel none of the same for you... you men stayed. You stayed after they took all our horses. You stayed after all the others deserted. You stayed on the promise that the army would resupply us. I've looked for that wagon from Fort Hays just as you have... day after miserable day. All I can say is that I'm proud of you. Get your things men, we're leaving this place. The army... can go to hell.
DUNBAR => Timmons... Timmons.
DUNBAR => Timmons.
DUNBAR => Something's out there...
TIMMONS => Somethin' dead.
DUNBAR => Might have a look.
TIMMONS => Might stay clear of whatever did the killin'.
DUNBAR => How come we haven't seen any buffalo?
TIMMONS => Can't figger the stinkin' buffalo. Sometimes you don't see 'em for days, sometimes they're thick as curls on a whore.
DUNBAR => What about Indians?
TIMMONS => Goddamn Indians you'd jus' as soon not see, lessen the bastards're dead. Nothing but thieves and beggars.
TIMMONS => Not what you'd call a going concern.
TIMMONS => Ain't nothin' here lieutenant.
TIMMONS => Everybody's run off... or got kilt.
DUNBAR => Alright...lets unload the wagon.
TIMMONS => What, and leave it all here?
DUNBAR => I'm staying too... we don't know what's happened.
TIMMONS => There ain't nothin' here lieutenant.
DUNBAR => Not at the moment, no.
TIMMONS => So things bein' the way they are we might as well turn around and get started back.
DUNBAR => This is my post...
TIMMONS => This is my... are you crazy boy?
DUNBAR => This is my post! And these are the post's provisions. Now get your ass off that wagon and help me unload.
TIMMONS => Well... I'll let 'em know where you are.
DUNBAR => Good.
TIMMONS => Good luck lieutenant.
DUNBAR => Thank you.
DUNBAR => Have arrived to find Fort Sedgewick deserted. Am now waiting for the garrison's return or word from headquarters. Post is in exceedingly poor condition. Have decided to assign myself clean-up duty beginning tomorrow. Supplies abundant. The country is everything I dreamed it would be. There can be no place like this on earth.
DUNBAR => Damn... damn.
THE TOUGHEST => Only a white man would make a fire for everyone to see.
1ST PAWNEE => Maybe there's more than one.
2ND PAWNEE => We have no rifles. White men are sure to have rifles.
3RD PAWNEE => We should forget this and go home.
TOUGHEST => Then go. I for one, will not debate the merit of a single line of smoke in my own country.
1ST PAWNEE =>  He will not quit until we are all dead.
DUNBAR => No sign of Captain Cargill's command. I don't know what to do. Communication can only take place if I leave and I don't want to abandon my post.
DUNBAR => Made a short patrol yesterday p.m... discovered nothing. Will go further tomorrow.
DUNBAR => There is a wolf who seems intent on the goings on here. He does not seem inclined to be a nuisance however and aside from Cisco has been my only company. He has appeared each afternoon for the past two days. He has milky white socks on both feet. If he comes calling tomorrow I will name him Two Socks.
DUNBAR => Almost a month and no one has come. The longer this condition persists, the less inclined I am to believe that anyone will. Rain has forced me indoors for most of two days. I have begun an awning. The work has ruined my hands, but I am excited about the improvement it will bring to this place.
DUNBAR => It is the loneliest of times... but I cannot say that I am unhappy.
DUNBAR => You there!
DUNBAR => Have made first contact with a wild Indian. One came to the fort and tried to steal my horse. Do not know how many more are in the vicinity but I am taking steps for another visitation. Am burying excess ordnance, lest it fall into enemy hands.
DUNBAR => Have made all the preparations I can think of. I cannot mount an adequate defense but will try to make a big impression when they come. Waiting.
DUNBAR => The man I encountered was a magnificent looking fellow.
TEN BEARS => Kicking Bird has been keeping to himself these last few days. I do not like to see our medicine man walking so alone.
TEN BEARS => What does his wife say?
PRETTY SHIELD => He is keeping to himself.
PRETTY SHIELD => That's what she says.
TEN BEARS => Make sure that meat is soft... my teeth hurt.
TEN BEARS => May I come in?
TEN BEARS => No, no let him sit with me.
TEN BEARS => Our country seems good this summer, but I have not been out to see it.
KICKING BIRD => Yes... it is good. The grass is rich. The game is plenty and not running away.
TEN BEARS => I am glad to hear it. But the buffalo are late. I always worry about the bellies of our children.
KICKING BIRD => I was thinking of a dance.
TEN BEARS => Yes, a dance is always a good idea. It would be good to have a strong sign.
KICKING BIRD => Yes.
TEN BEARS => There's a funny thing about signs. They are always flying in our faces. We know when they are bad or good but sometimes they are strange and there is no way to understand them. Sometimes they make people crazy but a smart man will take such a sign into himself and let it run around for two or three days. If he is still confused he will tell somebody. He might come to you or to me and tell it. A smart man always does that.
KICKING BIRD => I have seen such a sign.
TEN BEARS => Oh?
KICKING BIRD => I saw a man, a white man.
TEN BEARS => Just one?
KICKING BIRD => Just one. He was naked.
TEN BEARS => Are you sure it was a man?
KICKING BIRD => I saw his sex.
TEN BEARS => Did you speak to him?
KICKING BIRD => No.
TEN BEARS => We will council on this.
KICKING BIRD => He might be a god or he might be a special chief -- that's why we are thinking of having a talk with him.
KICKING BIRD => You are right, we need meat today and tomorrow. But we must also have meat in ten years.
KICKING BIRD => But the whites are coming. Our friends the Shoshone and the Kiowa, even our enemies, agree on this -- the whites are coming. More than can be counted.
KICKING BIRD => Wind In His Hair has spoken straight, his words are strong and I have heard them. It's true the whites are a poor race and it's hard to understand them. But when I see one white man alone, without fear in our country, I do not think he is lost. I think he may have medicine. I see someone who might speak for all the white people who are coming. I think this is a person with which treaties might be struck.
TEN BEARS => It is easy to become confused by these questions. It is hard to know what to do. No man can tell another how he will be. But I know this... killing a white man is a delicate matter. If you kill one, more are sure to come. We should talk about this some more.
WORM => Otter doesn't want to go.
OTTER => Maybe.
OTTER => Who gets the white god horse?
OTTER => I have him.
OTTER => I don't know. My arm doesn't work.
OTTER => It was your idea.
OTTER =>  You're not hurt... I'm hurt.
WORM => I will be when my father finds out, his bow will be across my back.
COURIER => The party that went against the Pawnee is coming in...
COURIER => There are many hearts on the ground.
DUNBAR => I realize now that I have been wrong. All this time I have been waiting. Waiting for what? For someone to find me? For Indians to take my horse? To see a buffalo?
DUNBAR => Since I arrived at this post I have been walking on eggs. It has become a bad habit and I am sick of it. Tomorrow morning I will ride out to the Indians. I do not know the outcome or the wisdom of this thinking. But I have become a target and a target makes a poor impression. I am through waiting.
DUNBAR => Wait...
DUNBAR => Wait... you're hurt.
DUNBAR => Let me help you.
DUNBAR => You're hurt... you need help.
DUNBAR => She's hurt.
KICKING BIRD => The soldier did not come to fight -- he is going away and we will let him.
TEN BEARS => I am in agreement with Kicking Bird. We will go down and talk to the white man and find out what kind of white man he is.
TEN BEARS => I will not go... you will go... you and Kicking Bird. That is all I have to say.
DUNBAR => Welcome...  Come... please... sit down.
DUNBAR => Would you like some coffee? Coffee?
DUNBAR => I'll get some cups.
DUNBAR => Is the coffee not good? Too strong maybe? Here...
DUNBAR =>  Do you want some?
DUNBAR => So what are you guys doing? Looking for buffalo?
DUNBAR => He's a good one... good horse. My horse.
DUNBAR => Good horse.
DUNBAR => My horse. You see any buffalo?
DUNBAR => Wait just a bit.
KICKING BIRD => Buffalo.
DUNBAR =>  Buffalo?
KICKING BIRD =>  Buffalo.
DUNBAR =>  Buffalo.
DUNBAR => Buffalo.
DUNBAR => The sugar didn't figure to last at that rate any way. I don't believe I'd go too far in saying that a foundation for good relations is being laid.
DUNBAR => They have come again, as always the same two with an escort of six.
KICKING BIRD => Have you seen any buffalo?
DUNBAR => I believe I am dealing with Kiowa Indians as I have heard that word on several occasions.
DUNBAR => I am learning the Kiowa words for head, hand, horse, fire, coffee, buffalo, hello and goodbye.
DUNBAR => No, I haven't seen any buffalo. Are you hungry? I have food... are you hungry?
ESCORT 1 => He waved.
DUNBAR => Nothing I have been told about these people is correct. They are not beggars and thieves. They are not the bogeymen they have been made out to be.
KICKING BIRD => Stands With A Fist.
KICKING BIRD => We will talk awhile.
KICKING BIRD => Your wounds are healing well?
KICKING BIRD => You are happy here, with my family?
KICKING BIRD => Perhaps you will marry again when the time is right.
KICKING BIRD => We have word from many places that the whites are...
KICKING BIRD => They are coming into everyone's country. They will soon be in ours I think. This white man who lives at the old soldier fort, the one who calls himself loo ten tant... I have visited him and I believe his heart is a good one. He knows things about the whites which we do not.
KICKING BIRD => He is only one man.
KICKING BIRD => Every warrior in camp would fight them if they tried.
KICKING BIRD => I cannot make the white man talk. Loo ten tant does not know Sioux.
KICKING BIRD => You have a certain medicine which no other Sioux -- man or woman -- has.
KICKING BIRD => I do not ask this for myself... I ask this for all our people.
KICKING BIRD => I want you to try and remember the the word.
KICKING BIRD => You don't want to know.
BLACK SHAWL => Will she make the white words?
KICKING BIRD => Perhaps I am asking too much.
VOICE => Christine...
MOTHER => Christine... where are you?
CHRISTINE => I'm right here mother...
MOTHER => Get inside both of you.
CHRISTINE => Why?
MOTHER => Just do what I... oh God! Stay where you are. Keep down do you hear me?
CHRISTINE => Who is it Willie?
WILLIE => They look like Pawnee... my father and your father are talking to them.
WILLIE => Run Christine...
CHRISTINE => Why?
WILLIE => Just run!
WILLIE => Run!
CHRISTINE => Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the lord my soul to keep. If I die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take.
DUNBAR => Buffalo...
DUNBAR => Buffalo... (making horns with his fingers) Buffalo.
KICKING BIRD => Buffalo?
DUNBAR => Yes. Buffalo.
KICKING BIRD => The buffalo have come.
KICKING BIRD => Loo ten tant...
CHRISTINE => Help...
CHRISTINE =>  Help me...  Please... I need to get out.
DUNBAR => I wish I knew what to say.
DUNBAR => Thank you.
DUNBAR => Look I'm full... I can't tell the story again.
DUNBAR => Go ahead.
DUNBAR =>  You want to try... put it on.
DUNBAR => Here.
DUNBAR => This is too much... I can't take this...
DUNBAR => I can't... No more...
DUNBAR => I can't, I'm full... very full...
DUNBAR => That's my hat.
DUNBAR => My hat.
BIG WARRIOR => I found it on the prairie. It's mine.
BIG WARRIOR => He left it on the prairie. He didn't want it.
DUNBAR => Yes, it's good. But, I have to sleep.
KICKING BIRD => Where is loo ten tant?
KICKING BIRD => Does it scratch the skin?
DUNBAR => They asked me to dance...
DUNBAR => I was just dancing...
DUNBAR => To stay any longer would've been useless. We had all the meat we could possibly carry. We had hunted for three days, losing half a dozen ponies and only three men injured. Many times I have felt alone but until this afternoon, I have never felt completely lonely.
DUNBAR => Made a long patrol today. There is nothing to report. The truth is I am bored.
DUNBAR => Though only two days it seems like a week. I am missing the company of my new friends. I can see all of their faces, but somehow it is not enough. Tomorrow, I will make an unannounced visit. After all, they are my neighbors, what can it hurt?
DUNBAR => Go home.
DUNBAR => Damn him.
DUNBAR => C'mon Two Socks... you can't go... so go home.
DUNBAR => Alright then, don't go home. But stay... stay right here.
DUNBAR => You go home.
STONE CALF => You were right about loo ten tant -- he is a special white man.
KICKING BIRD => Yes, he is special... he should have a real name.
KICKING BIRD => I know.
KICKING BIRD => We were waiting for you.
KICKING BIRD =>  Welcome. It is good that you are here.
DUNBAR => Thank you... I feel good.
KICKING BIRD => Ask him why he is at the soldier fort.
DUNBAR => Wait... what is your name?
KICKING BIRD => What does he say?
KICKING BIRD => Ahhh... He's right. I'm sorry.
DUNBAR => Kick?
DUNBAR => Kicking?
DUNBAR =>  Kicking Bird... (to Stands With A Fist) What does he... is he a chief?
DUNBAR => Oh... (glancing at Kicking Bird)
DUNBAR =>  Your name... you.
DUNBAR => Up? Get up?
DUNBAR => Stand.
DUNBAR => Stands With A...
DUNBAR => Fist?
DUNBAR => Stands With A Fist. I'm John... John Dunbar.
DUNBAR => Yes.
DUNBAR => I try to answer all of Kicking Bird's questions but I know he is frustrated with me. He always wants to know how many more white people are coming. I tell him that it is impossible for me to say. When he persists I tell him that the white people will most likely pass through this country and nothing more.
DUNBAR => But I am speaking to him in half- truths. One day there will be too many, but I cannot bring myself to tell him that. I am sure that Stands With A Fist knows.
DUNBAR => A war party is going against the Pawnee soon and I have asked to go. I sensed that I have made a mistake in doing so but I could not bring myself to take it back. They are my friends and from what little I gather the Pawnee have been very hard on these people. I hope I have not overstepped my bounds.
DUNBAR => I'm glad to see you... please sit.
DUNBAR => They are Sioux enemies.
DUNBAR => I asked that he would think about my going.
DUNBAR => Then tell him this. I have been a warrior for longer than many of the young men that will go on this war party. Tell him.
DUNBAR => I know, I understand. But I cannot learn these ways in camp.
DUNBAR => I will be happy to watch over your family.
DUNBAR => Who is Dances With Wolves?
DUNBAR => Dances With Wolves... that's right. (to Stands With A Fist) How do you say it?
DUNBAR =>  Dances With Wolves.
KICKING BIRD =>  Keep on with the white man talk if it pleases you.
LITTLE BOY => What are you doing here?
LITTLE BOY => I'm hungry.
BLACK SHAWL => How is Dances With Wolves?
BLACK SHAWL => How is he learning?
BLACK SHAWL => You are not talking today?
STONE CALF => Some of your words are wrong... but you are learning fast. That is good. What can I tell you today?
STONE CALF => What is your question?
STONE CALF => She is in mourning.
STONE CALF => She is crying for someone.
STONE CALF => It is not polite to speak of the dead... But I will tell you... you are new. She cries for her husband. He was killed not long ago.
STONE CALF => It is Kicking Bird's place to say when she is finished.
BLACK SHAWL => People are talking about you...
BLACK SHAWL => They are proud of the medicine you are making with Dances With Wolves.
BLACK SHAWL => You can't, he is gone.
WORM => We got a snake.
OTTER => We're gonna see if it can swim the river. You wanna come?
STONE CALF => The Pawnee do not come for horses, they come for blood... and with many men gone, we are few.
STONE CALF => Get your weapons and come to my lodge.
TEN BEARS => No, the ride is long... the weather is bad. We can spare no men.
TEN BEARS => Take one man and go quickly.
TEN BEARS => Hear us now.  A white soldier with many far-shooting guns... how would he fight the Pawnee?
TEN BEARS => Dances With Wolves has not finished.
TEN BEARS => I am of the same mind as Dances With Wolves... we should kill so many that they never trouble us again.
SIOUX 1 => I killed this one.
SIOUX 2 => This one still breathes.
SIOUX 3 => Dances With Wolves...
1ST WARRIOR => Yes, I saw you shoot him.
2ND WARRIOR => You killed that one too.
BLACK SHAWL => How long will Stands With A Fist mourn?
KICKING BIRD => I don't know.
BLACK SHAWL => I hope it will not be too long.
KICKING BIRD => Something has happened? Well what?
BLACK SHAWL => She has found love again.
KICKING BIRD => With who?
BLACK SHAWL => Dances With Wolves.
KICKING BIRD => Are you certain of this?
BLACK SHAWL => When you see them together you will know.
KICKING BIRD => What are people saying? They're not angry?
BLACK SHAWL => No. They like the match. It makes sense. They are both white.
KICKING BIRD => I suppose I will be the one to say something.
BLACK SHAWL => She's your daughter now.
BLACK SHAWL => You can't see everything coming.
KICKING BIRD => Stands With A Fist.
KICKING BIRD => You are no longer a widow.
KICKING BIRD => This is a good day for me.
KICKING BIRD => Stands With A Fist... if you want this man, take his hand in yours.
KICKING BIRD => Have you heard all that I have said?
KICKING BIRD => Good, then take her inside... she is your wife.
WORM => Dances With Wolves' door is closed alot these days.
OTTER => I know that.
WORM => Maybe they're having a hard time. Some people have a hard time.
OTTER => Me neither.
OTTER => Maybe we should pull the smoke flap closed. Then they would come out.
KICKING BIRD => Dances With Wolves, are you in there?
KICKING BIRD => I am riding today to a far away place. It is a place I haven't seen for a long time. A sacred place. I would like you to come with me.
KICKING BIRD => Yes it must be.
KICKING BIRD => No waiting?
KICKING BIRD => I was just thinking that of all the trails in this life, there is one that matters more than all the others. It is the trail of a true human being. I think you are on this trail and it is good to see.
KICKING BIRD => It is said that all the animals were born here... that from here they spread over the prairies to feed all the people. Even our enemies say this is a sacred place.
KICKING BIRD => No, they've been gone a week maybe more... we will water the horses and go home.
KICKING BIRD => Help me to know how many.
TEN BEARS => It's hard to know what to do.
TEN BEARS => The men who wore this came in the time of my grandfather's grandfather. Eventually, we drove them out. Then the Mexicans came. In my own time the whites came... the Texans. They have been like all the others who find something they want in our country. They take it without asking. I have always been a peaceful man, happy to be in my own country and wanting nothing from the white people. Nothing at all. But I think you are right. I think they will keep coming. When I think of that, I look at this bundle. Our country is all that we want. We will fight to keep it.
TEN BEARS => Tomorrow morning we will strike the village and go to the winter camp.
KICKING BIRD => We cannot wait for you.
KICKING BIRD => Something has happened... Dances With Wolves is not coming.
KICKING BIRD => Pick two good men with fast ponies and send them back to the soldier fort.
BAUER => Spivey...
SPIVEY => Yessir sergeant...
SERGEANT BAUER => Tell the major he's wakin' up... and move your worthless ass.
SERGEANT BAUER => Got yourself a helluva shiner, didn't ya?
MAJOR => Does he speak english?
SERGEANT BAUER => Don't know sir... you speak english? Talk english? (kicking at one of Dances With Wolves' boots) Talk?
MAJOR => Who are you?
MAJOR => Why are you dressed like this?
ELGIN => You have proof of that?
ELGIN => Spivey, you and Edwards were here first. Did you find anything... a journal.
SPIVEY => We didn't see nothin' sir.
ELGIN => Where's Edwards?
SPIVEY => He's outside. But he didn't see nothin' either.
SERGEANT BAUER => You turned Injun, din'cha?
SERGEANT BAUER => Din'cha?
ELGIN => What is your name?
ELGIN => You say you are an officer?
ELGIN => No.
ELGIN => There are no orders and there is no journal.
ELGIN => Why are you out of uniform?
GUARD => Here you... eyes front.
ELGIN => Why are you out of uniform?
BAUER => Lieutenant's askin' the questions here.
ELGIN => We are charged with apprehending hostiles, recovering stolen property and retrieving white captives taken in hostile raidings.
MAJOR => We will ascertain that for ourselves. Now if you guide us to these camps and serve as an interpreter, your conduct will be reevaluated.
MAJOR => Your status as a traitor might improve should you choose to cooperate with the United States Army.
ELGIN => Are you willing to cooperate or not?
MAJOR => Well, speak up...
MAJOR => What's that?
ELGIN => Sergeant... have a detail take him down to the river... let him clean up his face.
CRAPPER => You got paper over there Spivey?
SPIVEY => What's it to you?
CRAPPER => Well gimme some shitbird.
SPIVEY => Can you read?
CRAPPER => Naw, I can't read. What the hell do you care... you can't either.
SPIVEY => Alright... hold your horses.
SERGEANT BAUER => Lap it up Injun.
SERGEANT BAUER => Go on ahead Injun... You'll just get hungrier is all... but mebbe that don't matter. Word is they're gonna ship you back to Hays. And they'll hang you once you get there.
SPIVEY => I don't see nobody.
SPIVEY => Lookit the stupid bastard... he ain't even runnin'.
BAUER => Don't shoot, I seen 'em first... it's my shot.
DRIVER => It's my shot goddamit.
SPIVEY => You dumb sons a bitches.
BAUER => He mighta killed you.
SOLDIER 1 => I got him...
SOLDIER 2 => The hell you did...
SOLDIER 1 => I got him... dead shot boys.
SPIVEY => You want more?... get up... get up.
ELGIN => Spivey!
ELGIN => I see you bash the prisoner once more and I'll put those shackles on you...
ELGIN => You men! Get back to your places.
SOLDIER => All clear lieutenant...
TEN BEARS =>  Dances With Wolves is quiet these days.
TEN BEARS => Is his heart bad?
TEN BEARS => Quiet!... sit down Wind In His Hair. You are hurting an old man's ears with your loud talk.
TEN BEARS => Dances With Wolves?
TEN BEARS => Ahh... this is a nice fire... at my age a good fire is better than anything.
TEN BEARS => I wondered how your bad heart was doing and though I would come by and see for myself. This place doesn't look so bad-hearted.
TEN BEARS => But you are leaving anyway?
TEN BEARS => Have you told this to Kicking Bird or to Wind In His Hair.
TEN BEARS => You are the only white man I have ever known. I have thought about you alot. More than you know.
TEN BEARS => You have always spoken with your heart. And like all of us, you are a free man and can do anything you like. When I look across this fire, I do not see a white soldier. I see only a Sioux named Dances With Wolves. And there is nothing they hate so much as a Sioux.
TEN BEARS => You are making a pipe?
TEN BEARS => This might be a pretty good pipe... how does it smoke?
TEN BEARS => Let's smoke it awhile... it is good to pass the time this way.
KICKING BIRD => You've finished your pipe? How does it smoke?
KICKING BIRD => It doesn't seem possible that we could come this far.
