PETER => How we doing?
SUSAN => We'll see...
ANCHORMAN => Strickler's Disease crept into Manhattan like a thief in the night, claiming its first hundred victims before it was even classified.
ANCHORMAN => Most were children under ten.
ANCHORMAN => Only after the numbers had reached into the thousands were officials able to identify the carrier of the deadly infection...
DIRECTOR => Cut to three.
ANCHORMAN => Blattida Germanica.  The common cockroach.
DIRECTOR =>  Tell them we're ready for a live feed.
REPORTER 1 => ...an insect that has proven virtually immune to chemical control...
REPORTER 2 => ...the announcement by the Health Department that an end to the nightmare has finally...
REPORTER 3 => ...an ex-colleague of Doctor Susan Wyeth...
PROTESTER => ...Susan has always been opposed to biological tampering. A real advocate for ecological causes, it's not...
PETER =>  ...in Nature, evolution is a long, leisurely conversation between an organism and its environment. We, however, did not have the luxury of time...
SUSAN => With the aid of genetic labs throughout the country, we recombined cockroach DNA with genetic information from termites and mantids. We were able to create a biological counter-agent.  A new ally, if you will...
SUSAN => Blattida Traditor.
SUSAN => The "Judas Roach".
SUSAN => The Judas is a non-carrier of Stricklers, with a short life-span and heightened pheromone emission.
SUSAN => The female is basically a sexual magnet; common males travelled miles and fought for the right to mate with them.
SUSAN => When they did, they took away something else we added -- a hormone, passed through sexual congress that causes their metabolism to go into overdrive.  No matter what their food intake, they starved to death in a matter of hours.
PETER => We've achieved almost total eradication of the roach population.  As of today, the disease has been officially contained.
PETER => Sus, come on.  You're missing it.
PETER => Fucking thing! I hope someone's taping this.  Susan, come on.  It's really good this time. I got most of the lines out.  Sus?
PETER => Life's a bitch. Our 15 minutes came and went and all we got was bad cable...
PETER => Hiding from the hard glare of publicity?
PETER => A shame.  You looked great tonight.
SUSAN => Please.
PETER => You did!
SUSAN => Do you think we did the right thing?
PETER => Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
SUSAN => You know what I mean...
SUSAN => We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
PETER =>  Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
NEWSREADER => ...a flawless strategy which has stopped a potential epidemic in its tracks...
PETER => You hear that?  Flawless.
SUSAN => We just don't know.
PETER => We know we saved lives.
PETER => There're gonna be a lot of kids running around next year because of you.
PETER => Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
SUSAN =>  We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
PETER => Oh, I don't know. People are beginning to talk about us...
SUSAN => Don't worry, I'll save your honor. Maybe I'll even marry you.
CHINESE PREACHER => No.  Please, God, no!
CHUY =>  Oxfords, 8 1/2. Black...
CHUY =>  Funny, funny shoes...
PETER => Excuse me, ladies...
SUSAN => ...no, guys, these have to fit perfectly.  No spaces in between. Let me tell you why. Insects have no hands. All they have is this set of mandibles.
SUSAN => See?  This little piggy will grab the prey.
SUSAN => Then this little piggy will tear it in half...
SUSAN => ...and this little one will grind it to a pulp and push it in... all the way into the mouth.  These are precision tools here. Can you remember that?
SUSAN => Good.  Then get it right.
PETER =>  "Baby in a bottle..."
SUSAN => Don't tease.
PETER => You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
SUSAN =>  Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
SUSAN => Trust me. I've never been this late. Never.
SUSAN => If nun's pee is what it takes...
SUSAN => You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
PETER => Don't get kinky here...
PETER => Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
SUSAN => I'll be late.
SUSAN => Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
SIRI =>  Just like Trump Tower, then.
JOSH => ...So I say "buddy, you have every violation in the book.  Gimme one good reason not to close you down." You know what the Kraut says to me?
JOSH => The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
PETER =>  Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
JOSH => Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
PETER => Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
JOSH => Health Department...
PETER => You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
JOSH => Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
PETER => Peter Tyler, DOH. You gentlemen were the first on the scene?
WOYCHEK =>  We were both on patrol, saw this paint mess. Then I looked through that cellar window. We both did...
PETER => You gone in?
WOYCHEK => No. We waited.
PETER => Good.
PETER =>  Get the EMT's in there, now.
MANNY => C'mon Chuy, we're gonna be late.  Cops are bad news. Don't look at them.
PETER => Jesus.
WOYCHEK =>  They look real sick, don't they?
SUSAN => ...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
SIRI => I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
SUSAN =>  Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
SIRI => I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
SUSAN => What?
SIRI => She used a baster.
SIRI => Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
SUSAN => Oh, Jesus.
SUSAN => Come on, darlin'...
SIRI =>  She kept it under her bed. Thing is, it kinda worked.  I mean, she had to hide it from her husband, but...
SUSAN => What's this?
SIRI => Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
SUSAN => Hello.
RICKY => You the bug lady, right?
SUSAN =>  I suppose so.
RICKY => We're here to deal.
SUSAN => Metaxonycha Godmani, Trigonopelastes Delta.  Field Butterflies.  Have you been upstate?
DAVIS => Avenue B.
SUSAN =>  I guess they got lost in this city.
RICKY => So, you wanna buy em?
DAVIS => There's extra wings in the bag.
SUSAN => You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
RICKY =>  That's it?
DAVIS =>  Show her the weirdbug.
RICKY => Cost a dollar just to look.
DAVIS => It's a great bug.  We kinda broke it a little...
SUSAN => Fellas, I'll tell you what...ten dollars for everything.  Plus a killing jar, some tweezers and mounts so the next bunch you catch will be in better shape.
DAVIS => Deal!
RICKY => You crazy! That's the best!!
DAVIS => Bug's almost dead anyway.
DAVIS => Thanks, lady.
SIRI => Ten dollars?
SUSAN => Alphabet City kids- there's much worse things they could be selling.
SIRI => I hate this fucking window...
PETER =>  There's plenty of systemic infection already, so as soon as we get a preliminary reading, start them on anti-biotics. You saw this?
PETER => Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.
JOSH => Immigration's gonna love you for that.
PETER => Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
JOSH => Two shifts, people rotating from bed to work.  One toilet. We're in Wal-Mart hell, here.
PETER => Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
JOSH => Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
PETER => Tell her she's going to be alright. We'll take care of her.
YANG => She's delirious.  Keeps saying the "Dark Angels" are coming for her. She says they took some of her people away.
PETER => Dark Angels?
YANG =>  Probably a gang.  Chinese people, man. They come up with some wacky stuff.
SUSAN => Siri?  Siri?!
SIRI => ...the fuck?
SUSAN =>  Can you...?
SUSAN =>  Could you...help me...?
SUSAN => I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
SIRI => What is it?
SUSAN => I have no idea.  Are you ready?
SIRI => Oh my God...
SIRI => Shit!! Get it!  Get it!
SUSAN =>  It bit you.
SIRI => No shit.
SUSAN => This wing configuration. I've never...
SIRI =>  Fuck! It broke the skin...
SUSAN => And they're not fully developed.  This thing's not even an adult.
SUSAN => My God.
SIRI => What?
SUSAN => It's breathing.
SIRI => That's impossible.  Insects don't...
SUSAN => I know.  Help me get a sample.
SUSAN => Hold on, big guy, hold on...
SUSAN => Hold on a second...
SIRI => What?
SIRI => Susan?
SUSAN => Call security.
MANNY => Not too little, not too much. You rub it in, around and around like this. Let the leather take it.
MANNY => You watching? You should learn to work the shoes. You're good with your hands...
MANNY => Chuy...you gonna get all wet.
MANNY => Did you look at the story book I got you?
MANNY => Our Animal Friends.  Can you say that, Chico?  "Friends"?
MANNY => A friend is the one you can trust.  When you are with a friend, no matter where in the world, you are at home.
MANNY => In this city. A friend is a hard thing to find...
CHUY => Funny Shoes...
CHUY => Alli.  Mr. Funny Shoes.
MANNY => No one is there. Is empty.
MANNY => Chuy, listen to me.  They have Jesus on the cross, but that is not a holy place. You understand?
MANNY => Ah, Nino.  God only knows what goes on in your head, eh?
CHUY => Mr. Funny Shoes...
PETER => Josh, what was Immigration's countdown?
JOSH => Thirty-three workers.
PETER => There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
JOSH => Shit.
PETER => Remember what that woman said, about people being taken? Check with the copsin the area.
PETER => Sus?
PETER =>  Susan?
PETER =>  Thought it was my week for that.
SUSAN =>  I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
SUSAN => This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
PETER => Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
SUSAN => Don't you get it? It's more than that.
SUSAN => You know why insects don't grow larger? Because they don't have a complex respiratory system. What I saw did. It had lungs.
SUSAN => Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
PETER => We?
SUSAN => I did a PH test on its tarsal pads.
SUSAN => There's only two species who match the enzymes I found.  One's a leaf-cutter ant in the Amazon...
SUSAN => The other we released here two years ago.
ARMENIAN DRIVER => Avenue B... again! Maybe you got wrong letter, uh?
SUSAN => Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
PETER => Maybe they lied to you.
SUSAN => Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
ARMENIAN => No... Oh, shit. Get away, you Turk!
SUSAN => Pull over!
ARMENIAN DRIVER => What...?
SUSAN => Metaxonycha Godmani.
PETER => So?
RICKY => If you want your money back, forget it!
DAVIS => We already spent it!
SUSAN => We're here to deal.
PETER => Here, let me...
SUSAN => You sure you didn't see one of these?
RICKY => Gross. What is it?
SUSAN => An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
RICKY =>  No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
DAVIS => It was in that corner over there.
RICKY => Sucker was fast, man.  Had to take it out with one a these.
PETER => Okay, guys.  We'll take it from here.
RICKY => Make it ten an' we won't tell the cops you're here.
PETER => Let's keep it at five and I won't condemn your clubhouse.
PETER =>  Look, a broken tooth...
SUSAN => You okay?
SUSAN => There's something under here.
PETER => Shit.
SUSAN => Let me try.  My hands are smaller.
PETER => Honey, just leave it.
SUSAN => No, there's...
LEONARD =>  Now don't tell me.
LEONARD => You lost a token, right?
PETER => Look, I showed you my badge...
LEONARD => Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
PETER => The Department of Public Health...
LEONARD => ...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
PETER => Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
LEONARD => Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
CHUY => Gucci.  Flat pump.
ERNEST => Your shoes.
SUSAN =>  That's wonderful!  What grade are you in?
ERNEST => No school. Shoes're all Chuy knows about.
MANNY =>  He's special.
LEONARD => He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
PETER =>  Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
LEONARD => No, you talkin' at me.
ERNEST =>  Is there some reward for this?
SUSAN => I guess that could be arranged.
PETER => For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
LEONARD => You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
PETER => You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
SUSAN => I heard how you talked to him.
PETER => Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
SUSAN => He was just doing his job.
PETER => Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
PETER => He wants a permit, I'll get him a permit.
ERNEST => Chrissakes...
ERNEST => Guys, c'mon.
ERNEST => I told you to stick by the maintenance area.
BAG LADY => Nah... It's private property now.
SKELETAL BUM => He eats down there.
ERNEST => Who?
HOMELESS MAN => The Stickman.
BAG LADY => Long John.
ERNEST => Graffiti artist, uh?  Look guys, just get off my beat, you hear?  Get moving.
ERNEST => Hey, buddy!
ERNEST => Get off my track...
ERNEST => Sweet Jesus...
PETER => Heya.  Where's the boss?
SIRI => Ant mound.
PETER => You okay?
SIRI => It's just a headache.  We were sandblasting Trump Tower here since four this morning.
PETER => Maybe you should sit...
SIRI => I'm fine. Go talk to Susan.  She could use a good word right now.
PETER => Great crowd.
SUSAN => No such thing, baby.
SUSAN => I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
PETER => Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
SUSAN =>  Right.
PETER => What's wrong?
SUSAN => Oh...nothing that a little menopausal's pee daikiri couldn't cure. Least that's what I thought.
PETER =>  Oh, no, you were-
SUSAN => I was just late.
SUSAN => Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
PETER => Susan, we're not b-
SIRI => Susan?
SIRI =>  I'm sorry.  I think...I need...
SUSAN => Siri...
SUSAN => Siri!
PETER => ...I think it's some kind of systemic infection, Chris.  I saw a few cases like it yesterday. A sweatshop in Canal.
RAYMOND =>  Okay, look.  You better come in with me.  Help me through.
RAYMOND =>  All hands on deck, Pete. Remember the dril?
PETER => It'll come back to me.
PETER => Looks like a Lyme disease rash.
RAYMOND => It's not consistent with the internal bleeding. Any idea what bit her?
RAYMOND => I think we're gonna need to have that specimen here.
CHUY => Mr. Funny Shoes.
SUSAN => ...you don't even know what you're looking for.
PETER => You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
SUSAN => Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
PETER => No.
PETER => Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...
SUSAN => It didn't bite me.
PETER => I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
PETER => Chris is going to run some blood tests on you.  I want you to stay here till he's absolutely sure you're clean.  Okay? Then you'll call me... You'll catch up with us...
PETER => We'll be all right, Sus.  I promise.
MANNY => My father saw me stay in bed, he'd go get a pitcher. Cold water, whoosh, I tell you that's some alarm clock, brrrrr!
MANNY => Ah! There you go! The way you like 'em, Chu-chu...  We're low on milk, you remind Grampa to pick some up tonight, okay?
WORKMAN => Hold up!  We gotta block on filter D.
WORKMAN => Oh, God...
CONTROL BOOTH => VOICE What's the problem?
WORKMAN => I think it's a baby!
RAYMOND => How you feeling?
SUSAN => You tell me.
RAYMOND => Your blood tests were all negative. You checked out.
SUSAN => What about Siri?
RAYMOND => She's stable.  I don't think there's any immediate danger, but we'll have to keep her under observation...
SUSAN => You think it's some form of Strickler's, don't you?
RAYMOND => Pathology's still working on the tissue samples.  If it is...it must be an errant strain.  Shorter incubation period.  I'm sorry, Sue.  We just don't know yet.
JEREMY => ...how many times I gotta tell you, man: we can't accept this!
EMT => Well, what the hell else am I suppose to do with it?
JEREMY => Take it out back and throw it in the friggin' dumpster!
EMT => Not unless somebody signs for it.
SUSAN => Oh, my God.
JEREMY => Hey, you can't...
SUSAN => What's your name?
JEREMY => Jeremy...
SUSAN => Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
JEREMY => Lady...
SUSAN => Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
JEREMY => Okay.
SUSAN =>  Where'd you find it?
EMT => Washed up at the filtration plant on Bank street. Some asshole there thought it was a baby. They called us.
EMT => It's a lobster, right?
LEONARD => Better hurry it up, Doc. My shift's almost over.
PETER => Guess someone requested you for overtime...buddy.
SUSAN => Posterior sternites are gone...half the protonum rotted off.
RAYMOND => Maggots...
SUSAN => Near hatching.  Thing must've died about three weeks ago.
SUSAN => Do you have a polaroid?
LEONARD => You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
JOSH =>  New York's finest.
JOSH => There's really people living down here?
LEONARD => Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...
LEONARD => Substance abusers, mental cases... Then about a year ago, Poof! All gone. Rumors got started... Someone found a couple of stiffs...
LEONARD => Down here's the land of talk, see? So the wildest version goes the farthest. They mark that area with a sign or a drawing, and its as good as closed.  We had one fella... for years said he was Bela Lugosi. Got him on Geraldo.
SUSAN => It's me. Can you hear me?
PETER =>  Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
SUSAN => I have.
SUSAN => I'm on my way. I've got something for you to look at...
PETER => We'll be back at the platform in...
LEONARD => 20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
PETER =>  20 minutes.  Susan?
LEONARD => Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
JOSH => What?
LEONARD => Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're usually around.
MANNY => No, no, please understand... I can't wait that long.
MANNY => Please. I write it down.  2... 8... 7... 3. What does this mean "case number"? Okay. So, now what?  When can you...?
MANNY => No, I can't wait...no, listen...
MANNY => Hijos de puta.
MANNY => Mr. Funny Shoes.
JOSH =>  Smells like acid.
PETER => Ammonia.
JOSH => Peter...
PETER => Yeah...?
JOSH => There's some weird shit here.
PETER => Weird shit...?
JOSH => Take a look.
JOSH => Fecal matter, unknown origin: weird shit.  Whatever it is, it's not human.
LEONARD => And it needs some metamucil.
MANNY => Chuy...
MANNY => Chuy...
REPAIRMAN => Hey, Lady, all power will be down in five minutes, okay?
SUSAN => Okay....
SUSAN => Peter?
LEONARD => I've never been this deep. This area here is the Old Armory station. They built it in the 40's. Ran out of money half-way through...
LEONARD => Okay, the fat lady's singing. Time to go.
PETER =>  I want a team in here by six tonight, hands and knees with toothpicks...
PETER => Don't!!
LEONARD => Did you see the size of that thing?!
PETER => Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
JOSH => Peter!
PETER => It's okay.  I'm all right.
LEONARD => Get the hell away from me!
PETER =>  He's all right, too.
LEONARD => Oh, that's gonna work.
PETER => You got a better way up?
LEONARD =>  Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
JOSH => H-how do I get...?
LEONARD => Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to your right...
LEONARD => Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
JOSH => I think so. One right, two lefts...
LEONARD => And a right.
JOSH => Right.
PETER => Go Josh. Now.
SUSAN => HELP!!!
JOSH => Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!
PETER => Any luck?
LEONARD => Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
PETER => You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
LEONARD => Oh, man, there you go again.
PETER => What?
LEONARD => Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
PETER => For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
LEONARD => All right, motherfucker, that's it.
PETER => Shh! Shh!
LEONARD =>  Manny?!
LEONARD => My God, what the hell are you...?
MANNY => Hurry, the woman needs help!
PETER => Woman?
SUSAN =>  Don't.
PETER => Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
PETER =>  Give me your belts.
LEONARD =>  What are you doing down here?
MANNY => Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
PETER => What's...?
MANNY => Just hurry.
PETER => I'm coming, Sus, I'm coming.
SUSAN => No, Jesus, no.
PETER =>  Toss the flare down!
LEONARD => I only got...
PETER => Just do it!
PETER => Oh, Jesus...
LEONARD => What the fuck is that?! What the fuck is that?!
SUSAN =>  Peter...
PETER => Wrap it around your hand!
PETER => Come on!
PETER => Get on my shoulders!
PETER => Let's go!
PETER => Oh, shit...
MANNY => There!
LEONARD => Get the goddam door!
PETER => Push it! Push it! Don't let up!
LEONARD => What the fuck was that?
LEONARD => You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
MANNY => Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
PETER =>  We don't know!! We don't know what it is!
PETER => Wait a minute-
LEONARD => Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
LEONARD => GET IT!  GET IT OFF ME!
PETER => Its muscles are locked.
LEONARD =>  Oh, Jesus!!
MANNY => Wait...
LEONARD => Oh, Jesus! It's hitting the bone man, get it off!!
PETER =>  Hey hey hey...
MANNY => Is how we make loose the ticks back home.
PETER => Just keep holding it.  Can you do that for me?  Susan?
MANNY => Doctor Tyler?
PETER => You feel anything?
LEONARD => Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
PETER => Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
LEONARD => Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
PETER => I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
MANNY => Where the hell'd that thing come from?
PETER =>  A mistake.
LEONARD => "Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
PETER => It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
LEONARD => How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
SUSAN =>  It doesn't have a heart.
SUSAN => Just inner chambers...
MANNY => But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
SUSAN => No...
SUSAN => That's what it wanted you to see.
PETER => So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
SUSAN =>  That's camouflage...
SUSAN => This is mimicry. They evolve to mimic their predators. A butterfly can look like the eyes of an owl.  A catterpillar can copy a snake...
SUSAN => This has evolved to mimic the most dangerous predator it's ever had...
SUSAN => Us.
SUSAN => Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
MANNY =>  "...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
SUSAN => This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
SUSAN => All these...they're like tunnels of an insect colony. Once these things hit a certain population density, they'll have to move out, form new colonies.
SUSAN => We have to get help down here.  Burn the tunnels before...
LEONARD => Get the doors!
PETER => Is there a switch?
LEONARD => Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
SUSAN =>  The lights!
LEONARD =>  Where's the damn crank?!
PETER =>  They're coming!
SUSAN => I got it!
SUSAN => Hurry! Please!
LEONARD => Come on, you son-of-a...
SUSAN => Oh, God.  The blood...
SUSAN => His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
PETER => How?!
PETER => It's no use! They know we're in here!
SUSAN => They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
PETER => Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
SUSAN => Exac...
SUSAN =>  Give me your razor.
PETER => What are you doing?
LEONARD =>  Shit!
SUSAN => Rub it on the windows!
PETER => What-
SUSAN => Just do it!!
LEONARD => What are you putting that crap on me for?
SUSAN => Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
LEONARD => Okay. That's us.
LEONARD => This track we're on? Goes down into the repair area.  The elevator's over here. Leads up to the active tunnels.
PETER => Can we get this car there?
LEONARD => Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
SUSAN => But the power...
LEONARD => Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
MANNY => Oh, how you gonna get there, Leonard? Hop?
PETER =>  Just talk me through it. I can go with Manny.
LEONARD => It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
SUSAN => Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
PETER => We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
SUSAN => Peter-
PETER => It worked before...
SUSAN =>  The scent won't last...
PETER => That's why we should do it now.
LEONARD => It's just a regular old pump switch, okay? Right by the track signal board.
LEONARD => The lights come up, you pull the switch.
MANNY => I pull.
LEONARD => You don't do that, we're on the wrong track.  You...
LEONARD => You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
PETER => Depends.  You got a memo?
