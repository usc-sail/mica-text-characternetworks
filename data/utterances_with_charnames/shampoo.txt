FELICIA => Oh, no.
GEORGE => ... what?...
FELICIA => That headboard.
GEORGE => Nobody can hear it.
FELICIA => I can. It makes me nervous.
FELICIA =>  Oh my God... Jesus... Jesus Christ... Jesus H. Christ.
FELICIA =>  You going to answer it?
GEORGE =>  Uh-uh.
FELICIA =>  Want me to?
GEORGE => Let it ring.
FELICIA => Boy, whoever she is, she doesn't give up.
GEORGE => Hello...  Ah, hi.
TINA => What took you so long?
GEORGE => Wasn't sure it was you.
TINA => 
GEORGE => I... uh... I... uh... can't.
TINA =>  All right, who're you with? Jill?
GEORGE => No.
TINA => 
GEORGE => No.
TINA =>  Awww --
GEORGE => I'll call you back.
TINA => Come on by.
GEORGE => I'll call you back...
TINA => 
GEORGE =>  Okay, okay...
FELICIA => You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
GEORGE => Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
FELICIA => You know what I'm talking about.
GEORGE => No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
FELICIA => Like what?
GEORGE => I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
FELICIA => Well, is she your girlfriend?
GEORGE => No.
FELICIA => Are you in love with her?
GEORGE => Her?
FELICIA => Are you?
GEORGE => No.
FELICIA => Then it's not your problem.
GEORGE => It isn't?
FELICIA => No. You know too many sick ladies.
GEORGE => I guess so.
FELICIA => How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
GEORGE => I guess so.
FELICIA => Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
GEORGE => Okay.
FELICIA => God, I adore you.
FELICIA => Shit.
GEORGE => Hello.
JILL => You're home.
GEORGE => Yeah.
JILL => I'm coming over.
GEORGE => I'll call you back.
JILL =>  No you won't.
GEORGE => What do you mean?
JILL => I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
GEORGE => Okay.
JILL => 
GEORGE => Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
FELICIA => Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
GEORGE => No.
FELICIA => What're you looking for?
GEORGE => My keys.
FELICIA => I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
GEORGE => I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
FELICIA => You mean that girl, don't you?
GEORGE => What girl, she's not a girl, she's just a friend of mine.
FELICIA => You son of a bitch.
FELICIA => Wait, at least wait 'til I'm dressed. I'm going.
FELICIA => Oh, Christ -- do you have any Kleenex?
FELICIA => Thanks a lot.
GEORGE =>  Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
FELICIA => Why not?
GEORGE => I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
FELICIA => What?
GEORGE => These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
GEORGE => She's got a...
FELICIA =>  Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
GEORGE =>  Yeah, I think so.
FELICIA => That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
GEORGE => I don't know.
FELICIA => Gee, that's very serious...
GEORGE => I know.
FELICIA => Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
GEORGE => She did?
FELICIA => It turned out to be cancer.
GEORGE => Wow.
FELICIA => So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
GEORGE => I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
GEORGE => And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
FELICIA =>  You're very rude... if you don't come back --
GEORGE => I'll be back in a while.
FELICIA => I don't want to see you anymore.
GEORGE => I'll be right back, baby, really.
GIRL => George!
GEORGE => Hey, baby, what's happening!
GIRL =>  Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
GEORGE => That's too bad.
GIRL => I have to see you.
GEORGE => Hey, stop by the shop.
JILL =>  Who is it?
GEORGE =>  Who do you think it is?
JILL => There were some shots.
GEORGE => What're you talking about?
JILL => Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
GEORGE =>  Where?
JILL => Here in the canyon.
GEORGE => Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
JILL => Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
GEORGE => What's gonna happen?
JILL =>  I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
GEORGE => Well, like what?
JILL => I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
JILL => I've had these dumb dreams lately.
GEORGE => What?
JILL => They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
GEORGE =>  Who?
JILL => I just... who what?
GEORGE => You said somebody... who?
JILL => I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
GEORGE => No shit?
GEORGE => Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
JILL =>  George, I don't --
GEORGE => You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside.
JILL => George --
GEORGE =>  Keep moving --
JILL => Now, George --
GEORGE => Nobody's gonna get you but me!
GEORGE => How are you, baby?
JILL => Fine. How are you?
GEORGE => Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
JILL => What?
GEORGE => I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
JILL => How?
GEORGE =>  Right now -- I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.
GEORGE => When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
JILL => Honey, what happened?
GEORGE => I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
JILL => I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
GEORGE => I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
JILL => What about me?
GEORGE =>  You're different.
JILL => I am?
GEORGE => You're great.
JILL => I am?
GEORGE => Yeah.
JILL => Do you really mean that?
GEORGE => Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
JILL => Honey?
GEORGE => Yeah, baby.
JILL => Why am I great?
GEORGE => Jesus, I don't know. You're great.
JILL => Will we live together?
GEORGE => We live together now.
JILL => But in the same house, you know, one house.
GEORGE =>  -- Sure.
JILL => Maybe you don't even like children.
GEORGE => Of course I like children.
JILL => You've never even been around one.
GEORGE => I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
JILL =>  Yeah.
GEORGE => Okay...  Night, baby.
JILL =>  George?
GEORGE => What!
JILL => Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
GEORGE =>  Okay, baby. Okay...
JILL => Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
PETTIS =>  Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
GEORGE =>  Right.
PETTIS => How is she?
GEORGE => Great.
PETTIS => Wonderful woman.
GEORGE => She is.
PETTIS => I went to school with her husband.
GEORGE => Great.
PETTIS =>  So you want to go in business for yourself?
GEORGE => Right.
PETTIS => And you need money?
GEORGE => Right, that's right.
PETTIS =>  You do know what money's like these days.
GEORGE =>  Well, yeah... you know.
PETTIS => Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
GEORGE => They are?
PETTIS => After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
GEORGE => I guess not...
PETTIS => It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
PETTIS => What sort of references do you have?
GEORGE => Well, I do Barbara Rush.
PETTIS => Pardon me?
GEORGE =>  Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
PETTIS => I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
JACKIE => I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
JILL => Who is that?
JACKIE =>  A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
JACKIE =>  Hi, Leonard.
LEONARD => Jackie, what're you doing?
JACKIE =>  Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
LEONARD => I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
JACKIE => Poster-Kleiser.
LEONARD => Oh yeah?
JACKIE => That's right.
LEONARD => I'll call you.
JACKIE => Fine.
LEONARD => See you later.
JACKIE => Anyway, you're crazy.
JILL => I am? I mean why?
JACKIE => Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
JILL => I'm not. Maybe I am.
JACKIE => No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
JACKIE => Well, he is.
JILL =>  So what's your point?
JACKIE => Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
JILL => I know, I'm sorry.
JACKIE => I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
JILL => George is great but I know what you mean.
JACKIE => Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
JILL => I guess not.
GEORGE =>  I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
PETTIS => Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
JILL => Egypt?
POPE => That's right.
JILL => But why Egypt?
POPE => Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
PRODUCER => You seem disappointed.
JILL => No... how long did you say?
PRODUCER => Three weeks.
JILL => Egypt?
PRODUCER => Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
JILL => No, it's not that...
PRODUCER => Do you have children?
JILL => No.
PRODUCER => Are you married?
JILL => No.
PRODUCER => Do you have something against traveling?
JILL =>  No.
POPE => Well, do you have something against us?
JILL => No!
PRODUCER =>  John...
POPE =>  Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
JILL => Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
PRODUCER => We'll let you know tomorrow.
JILL => Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
PRODUCER =>  Thanks for coming by.
JILL => Oh. thank you.
POPE => Sure.
POPE =>  This town...
GIRL => Hi, George.
GEORGE => Hey, baby, what's happening?
GIRL => Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
GEORGE => Great, great. I hope you make it.
GIRL => Call me!
GEORGE => I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
GIRL =>  Okay!
GEORGE =>  God damn it.
TINA => Great... great... great... great... great!
TINA => Great, Dennis.
TINA => Do you think there's enough height? I mean do you think there's enough height?
TINA => George, do you think there's enough height?
GEORGE =>  Yeah, sure.
TINA => Dennis doesn't think so.
DENNIS => Man, I didn't say a word.
TINA => Well, what do you think? Is there enough height?
FELICIA => You're late, George.
GEORGE =>  I gotta talk to you.
FELICIA => I don't want to talk about it...
GEORGE => But you don't know what happened.
FELICIA => I don't care.
TINA => George, do you think there's too much height?
GEORGE =>  It's great. You don't know what happened, this girl she almost got--
FELICIA =>  I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
GEORGE => Calm down, baby.
FELICIA =>  I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
GEORGE => -- What?
FELICIA => Nummers.
GEORGE => What?
FELICIA => -- Numbers, and I don't need to place myself in that kind of position.
GEORGE => What're you here for?
GLORIA =>  -- A wash and set.
GEORGE => No.
GLORIA => No?
GEORGE => You need a cut.
GLORIA => But Mr. Norman said --
GEORGE => Said what!
GLORIA =>  I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
GEORGE => Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut.  But I don't want to place you in that position either.
FELICIA => -- I like myself far too much, far too much.
GEORGE => I don't want to place you in any position --
FELICIA => -- to be put in that kind of position...
GEORGE =>  I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
MARY =>  Yeah!
GEORGE => Wash her.
MARY =>  What with?
GEORGE =>  -- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
MARY => -- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
GEORGE => -- Oh yeah.
MARY =>  But then again you ask for it -- you just like my Otis -- can't keep his hands outta ladies' hair either.
GEORGE => -- White ladies?
MARY =>  -- Oh my yes.
FELICIA =>  George --
GEORGE =>  I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
MARY => That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
GEORGE => I don't know if you don't know --
FELICIA => George!
FELICIA =>  I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
GEORGE => What kind of treatment?
FELICIA =>  I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
GEORGE => Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
JILL => George.
GEORGE => Hey, baby, what's happening?
JILL => They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
GEORGE => Great.
GEORGE => Jill, say hello to Felicia.
JILL => Hello.
FELICIA => Hello.
JILL => George.
GEORGE => Yeah, baby...
JILL => How did it go at the bank?
GEORGE => Great.
JILL => Could I talk to you for a second?
GEORGE => Hey, I'm, you know --
JILL => Could I?
GEORGE => Yeah.
JILL =>  I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
GEORGE => Go where?
JILL =>  Egypt!
GEORGE => Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
JILL => Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
GEORGE => Great... can we talk later?
NORMAN =>  George!
GEORGE => Yeah.
NORMAN => You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
GEORGE => Buffums?
NORMAN => Yes, Buffums.
GEORGE => I've got heads here, Norman.
NORMAN => You promised you'd do the show.
GEORGE => Oh fuck, Norman!
NORMAN => Don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
RICCI => Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
GEORGE =>  No, man.
RICCI => -- Right after I sprayed her?
GEORGE => What?
RICCI =>  She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
RICCI => I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
GEORGE =>  She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
FELICIA => I can see that.
GEORGE => You're looking great, baby.
FELICIA => What're you doing later?
GEORGE =>  Whatever you say.
FELICIA => We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
GEORGE => I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
FELICIA => What about?
GEORGE => All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
FELICIA => Why don't you see Lester?
GEORGE =>  Your husband?
FELICIA => Yes.
GEORGE =>  What about?
FELICIA => The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
GEORGE => Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
JILL => George.
GEORGE => Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
JILL => I already said hello.
GEORGE => Okay.
JILL => George.
GEORGE => Yeah, baby.
JILL => When can I talk to you?
GEORGE => Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
JILL => I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
GEORGE => About what?
JILL => Whether or not I'm going.
GEORGE => Going where?
JILL => Egypt.
GEORGE => Honey, have they offered you the job?
JILL => No, but I think they might.
GEORGE =>  Just a second, I'll be right with you...
FELICIA =>  Is she all right?
GEORGE => I don't know. Just a minute...
GEORGE => What do you want?
JILL => Your advice!
GEORGE => They didn't offer you the job yet.
JILL => I want your feelings about it.
GEORGE => Right now?
JILL => Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
GEORGE =>  Look, baby, can we talk about it later?
JILL => When?
GEORGE => When I get off work.
JILL => When is that?
GEORGE => I'll call you.
JILL => When is that, George?
GEORGE => I'll call you.
JILL =>  But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
GEORGE =>  Neither do I, baby.
JILL => What?
GEORGE => Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
JILL => ... Okay...
GEORGE => -- Anyway.
FELICIA => I hope she's all right.
GEORGE => She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
FELICIA => I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
GEORGE => No, I know.
FELICIA => And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
GEORGE => I know.
FELICIA => I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
GEORGE => That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
LESTER => Look, Kurt, I don't care where you have to go. I want Beluga Caviar there. Call Jurgenson's, call Chasen's... I don't care how much it costs... how much?... then spend it. Just make sure it's there. You've got all the money in the world to buy it. You understand? Just make sure it's there on the table tonight.  Jesus.  You've got to do everything yourself. You know?
LESTER => Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
GEORGE => Well, yeah.
LESTER => She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
GEORGE => Thank you.
LESTER => I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
GEORGE => Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
LESTER => I see.
LESTER => It's an unusual trade.
GEORGE => Yes it is.
LESTER => But the important thing is you're successful at it.
GEORGE => In a way. But...
LESTER => But what?
GEORGE => I'm better than the guy I work for.
LESTER => Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
GEORGE => After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
LESTER => It's good you want to do something, George.
GEORGE => Thank you.
LESTER => But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
GEORGE => They're not?
LESTER =>  No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
GEORGE => You're right.
LESTER => Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to...
SECRETARY => Mr. Karpf...
JACKIE => I'm sorry but I need an extra garage key.
LESTER => What for? What do you need the key for?
JACKIE => The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
LESTER => How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
JACKIE => Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
LESTER =>  Is that right?
JACKIE =>  Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
LESTER => Is that right?
JACKIE => So how's Norman?
GEORGE => Great. Who's been doing your hair?
JACKIE => I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
LESTER => George is going to open a shop.
JACKIE =>  No kidding? Your own shop?
LESTER => George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
GEORGE => Sure.
LESTER => I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
JACKIE => I am?
LESTER => Who were you talking to?
JACKIE => Who do you think I was talking to?
LESTER => My secretary saw you with that boy.
JACKIE => Steve?
LESTER => Whatever his name is, that actor.
JACKIE => Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
LESTER => Then you were talking to him.
JACKIE => I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
JACKIE =>  I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
LESTER => I'm not jealous of the dogs.
LESTER =>  Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
JACKIE => So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
LESTER => Of course not.
JACKIE => That's not very logical, Lester.
SECRETARY => He thinks the room is soundproofed. Don't tell him it's not.
GEORGE => How come?
SECRETARY => He'll have that awful construction crew back again, and they can never do anything right.
LESTER =>  It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
JACKIE => Really? How about starting with tonight?
LESTER => Sweetheart, I know it's rough but at this point -- my business involves handling money for some very touchy people, politics and so on... Felicia's at a very difficult period in her life... any divorce and settlement and so forth, my finances would have to be looked into.
JACKIE =>  You and your touchy investors.
LESTER =>  Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
JACKIE => You're lying about one thing, Lester.
LESTER => What's that?
JACKIE => You're still jealous.
LESTER => God, you're a doll.
LESTER =>  We'll work something out about tonight, I promise...
LESTER => Angie, give Miss Shawn a garage key for the Bowmont House, would you?
ANGIE => Yes, Mr. Karpf.
LESTER => Well, let's go down together. C'mon, George, I'll walk you out.
LESTER =>  Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
GEORGE => Oh yeah.
LESTER =>  Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
GEORGE => Oh yeah? I mean I know.
LESTER => So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
GEORGE => When?
LESTER => When?
LESTER =>  How about tonight?
GEORGE => Tonight?
LESTER => Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
LESTER =>  -- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
GEORGE =>  Okay.
LESTER => It's good you want to do something, George.
LESTER => I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
GEORGE => Oh yeah?
LESTER => -- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
GEORGE => I know what you mean.
LESTER =>  Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
JACKIE => Fine.
JACKIE => Jesus...
GEORGE => -- Yeah... your car down here?
GEORGE => -- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
JACKIE => -- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
GEORGE => I don't know. Probably not.
JACKIE => Jill's really great, isn't she?
GEORGE => Great... so how's everything with you?
JACKIE => Great, more or less.
GEORGE => How long you had this?
JACKIE => Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
GEORGE => I'm sure.
JACKIE => He's a very private person, actually.
GEORGE => Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
JACKIE => -- Well no. It never came up.
GEORGE => You going to tell him?
JACKIE =>  -- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
JACKIE => Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
JILL => Don't be silly.
JACKIE => You're really a love -- you sure?
JILL => -- No. No really.
JACKIE => Well, what is it, honey?
JILL => Nothing.
JACKIE => It must be something.
JILL => Well, it's George.
JACKIE => I thought you said things were great with George.
JILL => Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
JACKIE => We don't think marriage is important.
JILL => But you have problems?
JACKIE => -- Yeah, honey...
JILL => I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
JACKIE => Five times a day?
JILL =>  -- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
JACKIE => Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
JILL =>  Well, you know what I mean.
JACKIE => After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
JILL => I'm exaggerating.
JACKIE => How much?
JILL =>  Jackie --
JACKIE => What?
JILL =>  Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
JACKIE => He does?
JILL => Well yes -- you know that about George.
JACKIE => It's been so long I don't how long?
JILL => Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
JACKIE => I would say so, yes.
JILL => Honey?
JACKIE => What?
JILL => I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
JILL => -- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
JACKIE => -- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
JILL => -- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
JACKIE => -- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
JILL => C'mon.
JACKIE => Well, there was this one time --
JILL =>  -- Yesss?
JACKIE => -- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
JILL =>  -- uhh-huhh...
JACKIE => -- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
JILL => ... Mmm-hmmm.
JACKIE => -- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
JILL => Didn't you have any panties on?
JACKIE =>  -- He reached up and tore them.
JILL => What did you do?
JACKIE => Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
JILL =>  No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
JACKIE => No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
LESTER => Do you think George is a fairy?
FELICIA => Who?
LESTER => That kid... the hairdresser.
FELICIA => Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
FELICIA => Thank you, Mona.
LESTER => Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
FELICIA => Maybe... why do you ask?
LESTER => I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
FELICIA => Why?
LESTER => Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
FELICIA => I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
LESTER =>  You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
FELICIA => Yes, but... I thought...
LESTER => What?
FELICIA => That you were just indulging me.
LESTER => No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
LESTER => He's a nice boy. I invited him tonight. I'm sorry he's a fairy.
ANJANETTE => You're in a good mood today, George.
GEORGE => Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
ANJANETTE => Chicken salad.
GEORGE => Chicken salad, Devra!
DEVRA => I don't have any change.
GEORGE => Get some at the desk.
ANJANETTE => Anyway, you remember Harold?
GEORGE => Yeah, baby, how's it going?
NORMAN => George... Jackie Shawn.
GEORGE => No, I'd like to but I've got too many heads here, can't you stop by the shop?  Two caps, Mary, yeah, two.  Okay, but I have to be in Bel Air at four...
ANJANETTE => Don't you think there's too much gold?
GEORGE =>  It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
ANJANETTE => I don't know, I think...
GEORGE =>  Look, would you argue with your doctor?
ANJANETTE => No.
GEORGE =>  Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
RICCI =>  Wanda...
GEORGE => Oh yeah?
RICCI => You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
GEORGE => Yeah?...
RICCI => She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
GEORGE => I'm busy, man.
RICCI => If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
GEORGE =>  Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
ANJANETTE => I thought you were in a good mood.
GEORGE => I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
ANJANETTE => Don't you like her?
GEORGE => No, it's a very groovy girl.
ANJANETTE => Then what's the problem?
GEORGE =>  She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
ANJANETTE => What're you talking about, George?
GEORGE => Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
GEORGE => Where's the caps, Mary?
GEORGE => Mary? What's goin' on, Mary?
JACKIE => Hi. C'mon in.
JACKIE => Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
GEORGE => No, thanks.
JACKIE => Well, I do.
JACKIE => Where do you want to do this?
GEORGE => Probably the bathroom.
JACKIE => Can't you do it out here?
GEORGE => Well, it depends. If you just wanted a combout. I guess I could.
JACKIE => Well, what do you think?
GEORGE => I don't know. Why don't you sit down.
JACKIE =>  Is this all right?
GEORGE => Yeah.
JACKIE =>  Well, what do you think?
GEORGE => I'd cut it...
JACKIE => You would?
GEORGE => Yeah, I think so...
JACKIE =>  You don't seem very sure.
GEORGE => No, I'm sure.
JACKIE =>  Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
GEORGE => Okay.
FELICIA => Mona, Mona!
FELICIA =>  Have you seen the other one of these by any chance? I want to wear them tonight.  Oh... when George gets here, tell him to wait. I have to pick up a dress and I may have to have it fitted, but be sure...
FELICIA => ... to tell him to wait.
MONA => Yes, ma'am. But I have to go to the market...
FELICIA => Just be sure he doesn't leave.
JACKIE => Jill's coming with us.
GEORGE => Great.
JACKIE => She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
GEORGE => Yeah... I mean great.
JACKIE => Getting my hair cut is always a little nerve-wracking.
JACKIE => ... I don't get it done often.
GEORGE => Whew.
JACKIE => What's wrong?
GEORGE => It's hot in here.
JACKIE =>  It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
GEORGE => Yeah... wow.
JACKIE =>  Not too much, don't cut too much.
GEORGE => Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
JACKIE => The shrink? Many times.
JACKIE => Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
GEORGE => Do you? You still see him?
JACKIE =>  No.
GEORGE => Why not?
GEORGE => Why not?
JACKIE => ... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
GEORGE => And?
JACKIE => And what?
GEORGE => Did you?
JACKIE => It was after you, baby. After you.
GEORGE =>  Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
JACKIE => No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
JILL => Hello... oh hi, Johnny. Oh really? Thank you... Are you serious?... Tonight I'm busy, I... Right now? Oh no, you really couldn't come up here.
JACKIE => Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
GEORGE =>  Did Lester know about him?
JACKIE => There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
JACKIE =>  George...
GEORGE => I just have to do one little thing.
JACKIE => If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
GEORGE => I won't screw you up.
JACKIE => George... how about Felicia?
GEORGE =>  What?
JACKIE => Did you?
GEORGE => Did I what?
JACKIE => You know what I'm talking about.
GEORGE => Hey, I don't tell.
JACKIE =>  Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
GEORGE => Yeah?
JACKIE => Well, did you or didn't you?
GEORGE => Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
JACKIE => You did, didn't you?
GEORGE => Baby...
JACKIE => You did, I know you did.
GEORGE => One of my few virtues is discretion.
JACKIE => You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
JACKIE =>  George...
GEORGE =>  Yeah, baby...
JACKIE => You're a genius.
JACKIE =>  You're a genius, do you know that, you're a genius?
JACKIE =>  Oh, no.
JACKIE => Oh, no.
JACKIE =>  No! Don't! Please!
GEORGE =>  I don't want to... I swear...
JACKIE => It'll ruin everything.
GEORGE => I know... you don't know, I know.
JACKIE => Don't, don't, don't...
JACKIE =>  Oh, no...
JACKIE => It's Lester.
LESTER =>  Hey, doll... Jackie... honey... where are you?
JACKIE => Get up, get up, get up.
JACKIE => Oh God, oh God, oh God... do something, please God, do something.
LESTER =>  Hey, baby, are you sleeping?
GEORGE => Sit down.
JACKIE =>  What are you talking about?
GEORGE =>  Sit down!
LESTER => Jackie?... Jackie?
JACKIE => Shut the door, shut the door!
LESTER => Oh, I'm sorry.
GEORGE => Look, either come in or stay out!
JACKIE => Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
LESTER =>  Sorry, honey, I...
GEORGE => That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
GEORGE => ... she's very upset...
LESTER => What about, tonight?
GEORGE =>  That, and... I'll be done in a minute.
LESTER => Jackie?... Hey, I brought you a little something, doll.
LESTER => You look like you've had quite a work-out.
GEORGE => It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
LESTER => I know it, I know it.
GEORGE => ... this doing hair it's...
LESTER => I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
LESTER => George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
GEORGE => Oh, hey...
LESTER => It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
GEORGE => I don't know what to...
LESTER => Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
LESTER => I'd like a drink.
JACKIE =>  Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
LESTER => You ought to get rid of those dogs.
LESTER => They get hair all over the place.
JACKIE => They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
JACKIE =>  Here.
LESTER => Aren't you going to have one?
JACKIE => No.
LESTER => Why not?
JACKIE => Because I don't want one.
LESTER => C'mon, doll, it's five o'clock, have a drink.
JACKIE => I don't want one! First you tell me not to drink then you tell me to drink, which is it? I don't want a drink!
LESTER => I called to tell you I was on my way, but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
LORNA => You here to see my mother?
GEORGE => Yeah.
LORNA => She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
LORNA => Hungry?
GEORGE => A little.
LORNA =>  This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
GEORGE => No thanks.
LORNA => You're my mother's hairdresser?
GEORGE =>  I do her hair, yeah.
LORNA => Chopped liver?
GEORGE => No thanks.
LORNA => Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
GEORGE => No thanks.
LORNA => Did you hear me?
GEORGE => Yeah.
LORNA => Well, are you? Are you queer?
GEORGE => ... yeah.
LORNA =>  C'mon, are you or aren't you?
GEORGE =>  Gee, this is great.
LORNA => C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
GEORGE => Why do you wanna know so bad?
LORNA => See if you've been making it with my mother.
GEORGE =>  What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
LORNA => Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
GEORGE => Have you ever made it with a girl?
LORNA => I asked you first.
GEORGE => Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
LORNA => Well, are you?
GEORGE => Am I what?
LORNA => Making it with my mother?
GEORGE => I'd like to do your hair sometime.
LORNA => Why?
GEORGE => ... just, you could look very heavy...
LORNA => Don't make conversation with me.
GEORGE => What?
LORNA => You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
GEORGE => Yeah, it is.
LORNA => I never get my hair done.
GEORGE => No kidding.
LORNA => In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
GEORGE => No shit.
LORNA => You think that's funny, don't you?
GEORGE =>  Yeah.
LORNA => You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
GEORGE =>  Yeah...
LORNA => Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
GEORGE => No.
LORNA => Then what do you think?
GEORGE => That you're just like your mother.
LORNA => I am not like my mother!
GEORGE => You are.
LORNA => I am not!
GEORGE => You are.
LORNA => I am not!
GEORGE =>  Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
LORNA =>  Yeah.
GEORGE =>  Right now?
LORNA =>  Yeah.
POPE =>  Oh, scraves...
WAITER => Yes?
POPE => Thank you.
WAITER => What for?
POPE => Taking your hair out of my salad.
WAITER => Oh, I'm sorry.
JILL => Why don't you ask for another one?
POPE => Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
JILL => ... my friend doesn't like it here either.
POPE => All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
JILL => Well he's not exactly a friend.
POPE => Is he an enemy?
JILL =>  Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
POPE => -- sort of a boyfriend?
JILL => Sort of.
POPE => I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
JILL => Johnny!
POPE => My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
POPE => I'm terribly sorry.
JILL =>  -- never mind.
POPE => What does he do? Is he an actor?
JILL => -- no.
POPE => Good for you.
JILL => He's a hairdresser.
POPE => -- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
JILL => Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
POPE => Not with your hairdresser.
FELICIA => Lorna?
FELICIA => Have you seen George?
LORNA => He's in the bathroom.
FELICIA => Your bathroom?
LORNA => Yes.
GEORGE => Hi.
FELICIA =>  Hello, George.
FELICIA => I've missed you.
GEORGE => I've... missed you too.
FELICIA =>  It's okay, honey... it's okay now.
FELICIA => Comb my hair out later, honey.
GEORGE => No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
FELICIA => No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
GEORGE =>  But aren't you...
FELICIA => Right now, I just don't care.
GEORGE => Jill says nothing.
GEORGE => Where's your car?
JILL => A friend dropped me off.
GEORGE => Who?
JILL => Never mind. Where've you been?
GEORGE => A business meeting, I told you that.
JILL => What business meeting?
GEORGE => Look at the way I live.
JILL => I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
GEORGE => What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
JILL => I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
GEORGE => Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
GEORGE => I just wanna live like everybody else, that's all. I want clothes in the closet, and food in the refrigerator, and I don't want shit all over the house and running my ass all over town... I want my own house... I want an appointment book... I want to get up in the morning and go to bed at night... I want a normal life like everybody else, that's all.
JILL => I know, honey.
GEORGE => Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
JILL =>  Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
JACKIE =>  -- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
GEORGE =>  -- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
JACKIE => -- what guy?
GEORGE =>  -- this guy with Jill.
JACKIE => He's a director.
GEORGE =>  Do I need a ticket for this?
ATTENDANT => We'll remember you.
POPE => as they move to take his Porsche.
POPE =>  I'll park it.
GEORGE =>  What does he direct besides traffic?
JILL => Ha, ha.
GEORGE => Television or movies?
JILL => Commercials.
JACKIE =>  Feel better? Let's go.
GEORGE =>  Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
JACKIE => What about it?
GEORGE => Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job I've
NORMA => George --
GEORGE =>  Baby, you've been chippying on me --
NORMA => Yes, isn't it awful --
GEORGE =>  -- yes.
JACKIE => We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.

LESTER => Does she know about us?
JACKIE => Jesus, she's my best friend.
LESTER => Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
JACKIE => I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
LESTER => C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
LESTER => -- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
GEORGE => -- yeah?
LESTER => See she doesn't drink too much.
LESTER => See you later, doll.
FELICIA => George, darling.
GEORGE =>  Hey, baby, what's happening. Oh this is Jackie. Jackie, say hello to Felicia.
JACKIE =>  Hello, Felicia.
FELICIA =>  ... hello.
FELICIA => I'm so glad you could make it. I've been looking forward to seeing you.
MAN => Lester, what the fuck do you think you're doing?
LESTER => Jesus, Nate, I'm sorry.
NATE => Never mind, I'll do it myself.
LESTER => So far so good.
NATE => Aw there's nothing to worry about.
LESTER => You never know.
FELICIA => Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
GEORGE =>  Well she...
FELICIA => She what?
GEORGE => She's a friend of Jill's.
FELICIA => And who's Jill?
GEORGE => Well, she's a friend of Johnny Pope's -- you know, the director.
FELICIA => Oh.
JACKIE => No thanks.
KENNETH => Excuse me, I know I know you, but I can't think where.
GEORGE => Look, I'd like to help but --
FELICIA => There you are.
GEORGE => Wait a minute --
POPE => This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
JILL => Well... sure...
POPE => Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
JILL => George? Was he alone?
POPE => I don't think so.
JILL => Well did he go in there with Jackie?
JILL => That bastard.
POPE => George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
GEORGE =>  Baby, you gotta let me out of here.
FELICIA => Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
GEORGE => Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
FELICIA => Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
LESTER => -- fellas, fellas, just listen, you both have tidelands, you both want Uncle Sam to come through with offshore drilling permits -- so do it together --
WOMAN => So, little red riding hood says 'my what big teeth you have and the wolf says all the better to eat you with, my dear, and she says -- eat, eat, eat, doesn't anybody ever fuck any more?'
GEORGE => Don't do it.
JACKIE => That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
GEORGE =>  C'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.
JACKIE => He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
GEORGE => Sweetheart, you're drunk.
JACKIE => Oh God, what do I want, George?
LESTER => Hi, doll, what's wrong?
JACKIE => You know what's wrong.
FELICIA => Lester --
LESTER => Oh, Felicia, there you are, you know George and uh -- uh --
JACKIE => Jackie Shawn.
LESTER => Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
FELICIA => We've met.
JACKIE => Yes.
GEORGE => Well anyway...
LESTER =>  Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
FELICIA => That's George.
LESTER => It's just -- fabulous. (to George, an attempt at levity) Think you could do anything for me?
GEORGE =>  Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
LESTER => Isn't that bad for it?
GEORGE => No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
GEORGE => This really ought to be layered...
LESTER => Layered?
GEORGE => Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
POPE => I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
LESTER => Have they sat down?
POPE => Everybody but us.
FELICIA => They're waiting for you, Lester.
IZZY SOKOLOFF =>  I guess it's almost impossible to get work in the business these days.
JILL => Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
IZZY => A soap?
JILL => A daytime soap opera.
IZZY => And?
JILL => I was too old.
IZZY => What was it, somebody's daughter?
JILL => Somebody's mother.
JACKIE => Waiter!
JACKIE => One word out of you and I'll gargle with it.
SID ROTH => Aren't you hungry, Miss Shawn?
JACKIE => Not for rubber chicken, no.
SID ROTH =>  Well maybe I can get you something.
JACKIE => That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
SID ROTH => Sid.
JACKIE => Sid. You must be a very important executive.
SID ROTH =>  Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
JACKIE => You do?
SID ROTH => Yes.
JACKIE =>  -- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
LESTER =>  -- Senator, you should've seen those little kids! About forty of 'em, all blind. We put out these mattresses on the front lawn and they came running out of the house, tripping and falling all over the place, having a hell of a good time. I mean they were blind of course. But it really gave you a feeling of accomplishment. I tell you I never had such a good time.
FELICIA => Lester --
SENATOR => -- let me understand this was exclusively a home for blind children --
FELICIA => Lester --
LESTER => -- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
FELICIA => Lester, don't you think that uhh --
FELICIA => That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
LESTER =>  What do you expect me to do about it?
FELICIA => I just thought you'd like to know --
LESTER => Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
OTHER VOICE => Quiet! Cranston's on.
JILL => -- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
POPE => -- oh I don't know --
JACKIE =>  -- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
GEORGE =>  -- we can't now.
JACKIE => -- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
JACKIE =>  -- don't you want to --
GEORGE => Jackie, can we --
JACKIE =>  Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon --
GEORGE =>  -- you are.
JACKIE => Fuckin' A --
LESTER => Senator, excuse me a moment --
GEORGE => Now, Jackie --
JILL =>  -- she's a very compulsive girl.
POPE => I can see that.
LESTER =>  Hello, George. Your friend feeling a little under the weather?
JACKIE =>  -- you phony asshole --
LESTER =>  Oh, dear that's too bad. (with quiet desperation, to George) -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
LESTER =>  What was that?
SID ROTH => Illinois.
LESTER =>  -- oh, good.
GEORGE => Jackie, c'mon --
GEORGE => I've got to get her out of here.
JILL => -- go ahead.
GEORGE => -- well aren't you --
JILL => -- what?  -- I'll see you later...
GEORGE =>  -- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
JACKIE =>  -- gee...
GEORGE => -- what?
JACKIE =>  I don't know what gets into me.
GEORGE => You were great.
JACKIE => No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
GEORGE => No you didn't.
JACKIE => You don't think so? I do.
GEORGE => You were great.
JACKIE => You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
GEORGE => That sounds like me.
JACKIE => I am you, you little bastard.
JACKIE => Where do you want to go?
GEORGE => Sammy's?
JACKIE => He still having parties?
GEORGE => He never stopped.
ROSALIND => ... and so... to have this man... here... among us... who has helped... as has everyone here to bring so many people together... of all races, creeds, and colors...
FELICIA => Lester.
LESTER => Yes, sweetheart, shh.
FELICIA => -- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
LESTER => -- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
FELICIA => -- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
LESTER => Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
ROSALIND => Ladies and gentlemen, to Senator Joe East.
FELICIA => We cannot go into this later.
LESTER => That's okay too.
FELICIA => You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life.
SENATOR => -- this tells of the ancient grandmother who, upon seeing the garden gate of her childhood, stops a moment and says, hello garden gate, hello garden gate, garden gate, hello.
LESTER =>  -- look, Felicia, this party involves more than you and me, you know. These people are concerned about more than each other, you know.
FELICIA => -- is that right?
LESTER => -- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
FELICIA =>  -- is that what this is all about?
LESTER => Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
FELICIA => Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
LESTER =>  What are you talking about?
FELICIA =>  -- think what you have time to think, Lester.
LESTER => What are you talking about, Felicia?
DET. YOUNGER => Excuse me, Senator. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have to evacuate this room as quietly and quickly as possible. There's nothing to worry about. We'd like you to exit through the door here on my left... down the steps into the street, please!
JILL => -- here I am. Now what?
POPE => Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
JILL => Let's do that.
LESTER => -- have they located it?
LESTER =>  -- oh, sorry.
GEORGE => What are you looking at?
JACKIE => The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
GEORGE => -- yeah.
JACKIE => -- look, you don't have to entertain me...
GEORGE =>  Am I entertaining you?
JACKIE => We're friends.
GEORGE => -- sure.
JACKIE => -- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
JACKIE => -- there's a lot of players in there --
TWIN ONE => George!
TWIN TWO => George!
GEORGE =>  Hey, what's happening.
TWIN ONE => We're going to the jacuzzi.
TWIN TWO => Right now.
TWIN ONE =>  C'mon with us --
GEORGE => In the jacuzzi?
TWIN TWO => Sure, why not?
TWIN ONE => Come on, George --
GEORGE => No, later, maybe -- go ahead, I'll catch up with you --  I've got --
RED DOG => Where the fuck you been, Jackie? London?
JACKIE => -- no.
RED DOG => Real good to see you, man.
JACKIE => So what's been going on, Red Dog?
RED DOG => Hey, it's the same old shit, ain't it? No matter where you go, it's the same old shit. Nothing ever changes, nothing, man, nothing.  Hey -- you ever been to Cuuliacaan?
GEORGE => -- where'd you go?
JACKIE => -- oh I thought you were --
GEORGE => -- what?
JACKIE => Nothing.
RED DOG => Hey, man, what's happening?
GEORGE => Nothing.
RED DOG => That's right, man!
DEPUTY => -- we can't find a thing, Mr. Karpf.
LESTER =>  Can't find what?
DEPUTY => No bomb.
LESTER => -- oh -- well that's good, isn't it?
DEPUTY =>  It's good if there's no bomb. If there is a bomb and we can't find it, that's not good.
LESTER => No of course not.
POPE =>  -- we're going to be here all night.
JILL => -- why?
POPE => -- these bastards have me hemmed in.
LESTER =>  -- what's the problem, honey?
JILL => -- his car. They have it blocked.
LESTER => Oh that's no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
DEPUTY => -- sure.
LESTER => -- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
JILL => Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
LESTER => Everything okay, son?
POPE => Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
JILL => -- I'll get in the back --
LESTER => -- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
JILL => -- there's not much room --
LESTER => That's fine --
LESTER => See, nothin' to it.
LESTER => What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
JILL => Jill.
LESTER =>  Jill.
JILL =>  -- yes, Jill.
LESTER =>  Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
JILL =>  Thank you.
LESTER =>  -- just wonderful.
POPE =>  Oh, no shit.
POPE => Hi, what are we doing?
JILL => Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
POPE =>  Of course not.
LESTER => Call me Les.
POPE => Where to, Les?
LESTER => Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
POPE => Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
LESTER => Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
JACKIE =>  -- very nice, very nice.
GEORGE =>  -- mmm --
JACKIE => -- but you never were much of a tit man --
GEORGE => Mmmm --
JACKIE => -- ass and legs --
GEORGE => Look who's talking.
JACKIE => Me?
GEORGE => -- yes, you --
JACKIE => Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
GEORGE => Not me, pal.
LESTER => Whose place is this?
SAMMY => Sure I know Jill.
POPE =>  -- the bar's in there, Les.
LES =>  -- oh, fine.
LESTER =>  ... I'm...
JILL => -- so what's new, Red Dog?
RED DOG => Nothing, man. Same old shit. It's the same old shit wherever you go, nothing ever changes.
POPE => Jill, scraves is a --
LESTER =>  -- how's it going?
LESTER =>  -- is that Illinois?
LESTER =>  -- Sally?
JILL => -- so when are you going to Egypt?
POPE => You mean when are you going to Egypt?
JILL => Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
POPE => Two weeks from tomorrow.
JILL => You're going?
POPE => You're going.
JILL => You're kidding.
POPE => Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
JILL =>  Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
POPE => -- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
JACKIE => What's wrong?
GEORGE => -- do you want ice?
JACKIE => -- no.
GEORGE =>  -- we're kidding ourselves.
JACKIE =>  -- we are?
GEORGE => -- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
JACKIE => Why?
GEORGE => I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
JACKIE => -- but what about her? I don't want to hurt Jill.
POPE => What's wrong?
JILL => We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
POPE => -- he'll never know the difference.
JILL => -- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
POPE =>  I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
TWIN =>  Hey.
TWIN => -- it's getting soggy.
LESTER => -- in there?
THE GUY => Sure.
TWIN =>  Could I have that?
LESTER => Say --
THE GUY => -- what is it now, man?
LESTER => Do you know where I can find a towel?
THE GUY => -- the poolhouse.
JILL => -- there you are. Les. Les -- Les -- Les, we're leaving.
LESTER => Shhh --  -- now that's what I call fucking.
JILL => -- what --
JILL =>  Oh my God. Oh no, oh no. Oh no.
JILL =>  You son of a bitch! You bastard!
GEORGE => Honey? Where've you been? We've been looking everywhere for you.
JACKIE =>  Oh God.
GEORGE => Jill! Jill! Jill, goddammit!
GEORGE => -- Jesus --
JACKIE => -- well you better go after her.
GEORGE => -- shit...  ... wait here, honey --
TWIN ONE => George?  Who was that?
TWIN TWO => Far out.
GEROGE => Jill, honey?
GEORGE => Hey, Red Dog. You seen Jill?
RED DOG => She just went out the door, man.
GEORGE => Jackie?
GEORGE => Jackie?
GEORGE => Jackie?
TWIN ONE => She went up to the house, George.
TWIN TWO => You're a trip and a half, man.
GEORGE => Hey... you seen... Jackie...
RED DOG =>  -- out the door, man.
GEORGE =>  Jackie!
GEORGE =>  Jill... Jill... Jill.
OPERATOR => Jackie Shawn.
GEORGE => -- yeah, this is --
OPERATOR => -- yes, George.
GEORGE => I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
OPERATOR => Not yet.
GEORGE => Okay... thanks...
JILL => I don't want to fight, George.
GEORGE => I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
JILL => Bullshit.
GEORGE =>  I do, Jill.
GEORGE => How come you took your own car?
JILL =>  I didn't want him meeting me here.
GEORGE => Well that's something.
JILL => What is.
GEORGE => You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
GEORGE => You did fuck him, didn't you?
JILL => I'm very tired, George.
GEORGE => Didn't you, baby?
JILL => Let go of me.
JILL => Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
GEORGE => Oh, Christ.
JILL => Oh, hi... listen, can I call you back?... Yes... no, everything's fine, really... bye.
GEORGE => That was him.
JILL => Yes.
GEORGE => You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
JILL => Yes.
GEORGE => Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
JILL => I'd like you to leave now.
JILL => -- and take this with you.
GEORGE => Where did this come from?
JILL => Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.
JILL =>  So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
GEORGE => Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
JILL => Obviously there were others, weren't there?
GEORGE => Obviously.
JILL => How many?
GEORGE => What do you wanna know for?
JILL => I just want to know, that's all.
GEORGE => What difference does it make?
JILL => I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
GEORGE => Baby, please don't... I love you.
JILL =>  I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
GEORGE =>  Baby, don't do this --
JILL =>  -- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
GEORGE => -- please, baby --
JILL => -- no, it'll help me, really --
GEORGE => How?
JILL => I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
GEORGE => You dumb cunt, everybody fucks everybody, grow up, for Christ's sakes. You're an antique, you know that? Look around you -- all of 'em, all these chicks they're all fucking, they're getting their hair done so they can go and fuck, that's what it's all about. Come into the shop tomorrow and I'll show you -- I fucked her, and her, and her, and her, and her -- I fucked 'em all!... That's what I do, I fuck. That's why I went to beauty school, to fuck. I can't help that, they're there and I do their hair and sometimes I fuck 'em. I stick it in and I pull it out and that's a fuck, it's not a crime.
JILL => ... well I'm glad you told me.
GEORGE =>  Jesus.
JILL => I am... I mean, you know, that's...
GEORGE => What? What? What? What? What?
JILL => ... honest. At least you're honest with me.
GEORGE => Does it make you happy?
JILL => I wish you'd go now.
GEORGE => That's all you've got to say?
JILL => -- yes.
GEORGE => -- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
JILL => George...
GEORGE => Did you?
JILL => Please!... that's not like you.
GEORGE => Yeah, I know. Did you?
JILL => George, now cut this out.
GEORGE => Did you?
JILL => Stop it.
GEORGE => Did you?
JILL => Yes, yes, I did.
GEORGE => What did you say?
JILL => George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
GEORGE => What did you say?
JILL => George...
GEORGE => What did you say?
JILL => I said you were a loser!
GEORGE => No, I'm not a loser, baby, I just sort of break even.
LESTER =>  Wait outside, would you?
LESTER => You live like a pig.
GEORGE => Yeah.  How long have you been here?
LESTER =>  All night.
GEORGE => Well... who are those guys?
LESTER => What do they look like?...
GEORGE => Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
LESTER => Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
GEORGE => Well, what?
LESTER => Godammit, George...
GEORGE => Now wait a minute...
LESTER => Sit down.
GEORGE => But...
LESTER => I said sit down!
MAN => Everything all right?
LESTER => I'll call you, it's okay.
LESTER => Now, George, I want to hear it from you. Either you admit it, man to man, to my face or I'll have him pound it out of you, and he does a hell of a job, believe me.
GEORGE => I believe you...
LESTER => I wanna hear about it.
GEORGE => Oh Jesus Christ.
LESTER => I wanna hear about it, George.
GEORGE => Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
LESTER => I wanna hear about it.
GEORGE => What can I say!
LESTER => I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
GEORGE => I'm not anti-Establishment.
LESTER => That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
GEORGE => Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
LESTER => No, not yet, not yet. You worry about it for a while, I've been worrying all night, now you can worry.
LESTER => Was it me, did you have something against me?
GEORGE => What, do you think I planned it?
LESTER => Did they have something against me?
GEORGE => Didn't they tell you?
LESTER => I wanna hear it from you!
GEORGE =>  ... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
LESTER => ... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
GEORGE => We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
LESTER => Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
GEORGE => Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
LESTER => Why, why do you think that is?
GEORGE => Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
LESTER => Well, I don't know.
LESTER =>  Want a drink?
GEORGE => No thanks.
LESTER => Have a drink.
GEORGE => Okay, thanks.
LESTER => You don't have a clean glass in the house.
GEORGE => I know.
LESTER =>  I'll have to wash one out.
LESTER => Jesus, what a way to live. I never lived like this, not even when I was your age, not even when I never had a dime.
LESTER => Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.
GEORGE => Who?
LESTER => Me!
GEORGE => Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
LESTER =>  I was gonna give you the money. Probably I was. Shit, I don't know, I don't know anything anymore.
LESTER => I tell you, you never know... you just never know... one minute you're here and the next... I mean a man at my age, how long have I got -- ten years? Five years? I wish I knew... what I was living for.
LESTER => ... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
GEORGE => Oh yeah...
LESTER => Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
GEORGE => I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
LESTER =>  What about Jackie?
GEORGE => What about her?
LESTER => I mean, how did that happen?
GEORGE => Lester, it just happened.
LESTER => She's nothing but a whore.
GEORGE => No --
LESTER => Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
GEORGE => No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
LESTER => You really think so?
GEORGE => Yes I do.
LESTER => I'm finished with her.
LESTER => Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
GEORGE => What?
LESTER => Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know.
LESTER => I don't know anything anymore.
LESTER =>  Go easy on him, he's a nice boy.
LESTER => Just having a little fun, George...  Go on home.  I'll call you later about the shop. I'm beat. God, I'm beat.
NORMAN => You're late, George.
GEORGE => Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
DEVRA =>  Mrs. Shumann and Mrs. Young are waiting. Mrs. Young is kind of p.o.'d.
GEORGE => Where's Mary?
DEVRA => She hasn't showed up yet.
GEORGE =>  Norman!  Devra, I asked you to call Jackie. Call her.
DEVRA =>  All right.
NORMAN => What!
GEORGE => Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
NORMAN => You do it.
GEORGE =>  Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
NORMAN => You are today.
MRS. SHUMANN => Temper, temper, George.
GEORGE => Oh, Jesus, that fucking goddam Mary-
GEORGE => Mary! Get over here!
GEORGE => Mary, where were you yesterday? Huh?
GEORGE => You ran out on me and you left it like a goddamn pig pen.
GEORGE => What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
MARY => Otis is dead.
GEORGE => -- Otis?
MARY => My son Otis. He was killed in Vietnam. They done phoned me at the shop yesterday.
GEORGE => Oh, Mary.
MARY => -- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
GEORGE => -- oh -- sweetheart...
MARY => -- you shouldn't do me like that...
GEORGE =>  -- please, please forgive me...
MARY =>  -- you know better...
GEORGE =>  -- why did you come in today?
MARY => -- left my bag, didn't have no money...
GEORGE => -- how did you get here?
MARY => -- took a bus.
GEORGE => -- c'mon, I'll get you home...
JACKIE => -- just a minute, you're early --
GEORGE => -- good afternoon --
JACKIE => -- you've got to leave.
GEORGE => I've got to leave?
JACKIE => -- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
GEORGE => Why?
JACKIE => Lester's on his way.
GEORGE => Where are you going?
JACKIE => Please, we'll have to talk later --
GEORGE => Look about last night --
JACKIE =>  Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
GEORGE => It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
JACKIE => Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
JACKIE => My God that's him --
GEORGE => -- It's Malone's.
JACKIE => That's it, then I'm leaving.
CLEANER => Cleaners.
GEORGE => Pull over, pull over!
JACKIE =>  You're going to kill me.
GEORGE => No --
JACKIE =>  Well then what are you trying to do-
GEORGE => I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
GEORGE => Look, I don't know if I'll ever make it. I mean I'm a fuckup, but I'll take care of you, I'll make you happy, I swear to God I will.
GEORGE => Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
JACKIE => If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
GEORGE => So I'm saying it...
JACKIE => It's too late...
GEORGE => What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
JACKIE => Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
GEORGE => So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
JACKIE => What's that supposed to mean?
GEORGE => I don't know... Jackie?
JACKIE => What?
GEORGE => I don't trust... anyone... but you...
JACKIE => Oh my baby...
JACKIE => God, there's Lester...
GEORGE => Don't go, Jackie...
JACKIE => I can't just let him stand by the door...
GEORGE => Don't leave me...
JACKIE => I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
GEORGE => What for?
JACKIE => I don't know -- I've got to.
