Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.

But, these are the times..." and I wish what he said, we could have used it on TV, and, as a matter of fact, we can, if we... (HE LOOKS AROUND, SEES BREAN STANDING BY THE DOOR.) Look here, here's an idea... Here's an idea...  Turn it on it's head.  If we're ahead in the polls, well, hell, this is the time to capitalize on it.  What do you think?

BODYGUARD => No talking, please.
REPORTER => With seven days to go before the election, the Fortunes of President...
MR. YOUNG =>  ...took you long enough.
YALIE => Found'em as quick as we could, sir.
MR. YOUNG => When I'm done with'em, we want to dump'em in the District, or stick'em out in the country, have the F.B.I. trip over'em?
YALIE => Legal department says You Pick Em.  Depends on how big of a splash you want to make, how long you want them to Go Away for.
AMES =>  Oh, MiGod.
MR. YOUNG => Guess who I am.
AMES => I'd like to mention a few names, who...
MR. YOUNG =>  I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
AMES => I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose employ...
MR. YOUNG => Quite touching.
AMES => And I take this opportunity to suggest that, equally, I admit to nothing, and that I would like my lawyer present.
MR. YOUNG => Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there are no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania has no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.
BREAN =>  Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
MR. YOUNG => N'who might you be, when all's said and done?
BREAN => My name is Ronald Brean.
MR. YOUNG => Who're you working for?
BREAN => Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
MR. YOUNG => S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
BREAN => S'only got to hold for another few days.
MR. YOUNG => Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
BREAN => What are you interested in? 
MR. YOUNG => I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
AMES => As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
AMES =>  Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
MR. YOUNG => And I think that the Security of the Country would be best-served by its citizens obeying its laws.  Gemme a Federal Judge, gemme search-warrants, all premises controlled by our friends, and bench-warrants for the two of...
BREAN =>  Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
MR. YOUNG => I'm doing my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What is it you thought you were doing?
AMES => And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription medication, the side-effects of which...
BREAN => I'm doing my job, Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.
BREAN =>  Thank you.
MR. YOUNG => What's on your mind?
BREAN => I have a question for you.
MR. YOUNG => Ask it.
BREAN => Why do people go to war?
MR. YOUNG => Why do people go to war?
MR. YOUNG => I'll play your silly game.
BREAN => Why do they go to War?
MR. YOUNG => To preserve their Way of Life.
BREAN => Would you go to War to do that? 
MR. YOUNG => I have.
BREAN => Well, I have, too.  Would you do it again...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess so.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and Togo? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has passed.  It's passed.  It's over.  The War of the Future is Nuclear Terrorism.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own governments, have blah blah blah. And to go to that war, you've got to be prepared.  You have to be alert, and the public has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the future, and if you're not gearing up, to fight that war, eventually the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, this  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there ain't no war but ours. 
BREAN =>  It's just for eight more days.....
BREAN =>  One more thing, what is that river she's running across?
YALIE => What?

My military sources confirm that our troops, along the Canadian Border, And overseas are standing down, and I must take this opportunity to call upon our President to stand and face the charges, the heinous charges brought against him.  You know, folks, there is nothing in life as precious as the Innocence of a Child.  Nothing.  Now, I do not say these charges are true, I do not see how they could be.  Accusations of, of sexual misconduct in anyone, must be investigated.  In the case of a Sitting President, of one whose term, and I do not hesitate to mention it, ends, in, effectively, in a matter of days... I call upon the President...
AMES => What does he mean The Situation has Been Resolved?

BREAN => He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
MOSS => We'll deal with that when we come to it.  This is producing.  This is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles...
AMES => ...his Triumphal Plane.  Shot Down.
MOSS => Shot down, Forced down... (HE GESTURES, MEANING, THIS IS A MINOR POINT) You guys are missing it... You're missing the opportunity
SCHUMANN => Isn't it time for my Pill...?
MOSS => This is producing.  This is, this is, this is the Beauty Part.  You've got your fortune right here, and you were ready to throw it away.  Because he's got a Problem?  F'it was easy, anyone would do it.  Otto Preminger.  Had to film a scene, in EXODUS.  The proclamation of the State of Israel.  Needed twenty thousand extras, n'Jerusalem Park.  Not enough money to pay'em.  What did he do?  What did he do?  Printed up signs:  Be in a movie, fifteen skekels.  He Charged'em -- had to turn'em away.  That's producing.  That's producing... n'you know, someday, people're gonna tell this story...
BREAN => You can't tell this story.

AMES => How do we explain that?
MOSS => ...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
AMES => ...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
MOSS => Fuck the world.  Try a ten A.M. pitch meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the material.
AMES => But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
MOSS => How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a pitch.  You see? His records say he was in prison ... as they must, as all the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the secrecy required of....
