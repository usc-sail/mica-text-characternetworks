HASSAN =>  Good morning Abdullah... I brought you this...
HASSAN =>  It's almost new.
HASSAN => Three hundred cartridges...
HASSAN => The hunter who gave it to me said you can hit up to three kilometers away.
ABDULLAH => How much do you want for everything?
HASSAN => One thousand dirhams.
ABDULLAH => One thousand dirhams? I'll give you one thousand and a goat.
HASSAN => With this rifle, your sons will be able to kill plenty of jackals.
HASSAN => Let one of your sons shoot.
ABDULLAH => Let Yussef shoot.
AHMED => I want to shoot first.
HASSAN => Look, load it like this.
HASSAN => This is the safety. Push it in when you're ready.
HASSAN => If he doesn't hit the jackals, at least he'll scare the shit out of them.
ABDULLAH => Your turn.
ABDULLAH => Now this kid shoots a hell of a lot better than you.
YASIRA => Your lunch.
ABDULLAH => You better kill at least three jackals.
HASSAN => And make sure no one sees you with the rifle, hide it if you see someone approach you.
AHMED => Yussef, Yussef...
AHMED => Yussef...
AHMED => What are you doing?
AHMED => I told you not to spy on her again.
AHMED => I said don't spy on her.
YUSSEF => What the hell do you care?
AHMED => Come on, let's go.
AHMED => Five to two.
YUSSEF => There's a jackal over there.
YUSSEF => Over there.
YUSSEF => What are you doing, you idiot?
YUSSEF => Zora doesn't mind.
AHMED => She doesn't, but I do.
YUSSEF => This is between her and me.
AHMED => You're both pigs. Next time I'm going to tell my dad.
YUSSEF => Stay out of this.
AHMED => If you want me to stay out of it, don't do it.
YUSSEF => What are you doing?
AHMED => Hassan said that it could hit things three kilometers away, but it can't even reach that rock over there.
YUSSEF => That's because you don't know how to shoot. Give me the rifle.
AHMED => See, it can't reach it.
YUSSEF => Give me another bullet.
YUSSEF => See.
AHMED => Yeah, but that's not three kilometers.
AHMED => Yussef, come here.
AHMED => I bet you the bullet can't hit that far away.
AHMED => These fucking bullets aren't any good.
YUSSEF => You're not aiming right.
YUSSEF => What'll you give me if I hit that car?
AHMED => I'll shoot.
AHMED => You see?    Nothing happens.
YUSSEF => Let me shoot.
AHMED => I told you.    Hassan's a liar.
AHMED => Shoot at that one...
AHMED => See: nothing.
AMELIA =>  I won...
MIKE => No, I won.
AMELIA =>  Yes... yes sir... yes sir, Mrs. Rachel told me...I'm very sorry. How is Mrs. Susan?... No sir, don't worry...
AMELIA => Your dad is calling.
MIKE => Hi dad... dad, guess what? Today, at school, they brought some baby chickens...I held one in my hand. He was really little and he was all warm...  Dad, are you ok?...And Mariana wanted to take one home, but the teacher didn't let her...
AMELIA =>  Did you brush your teeth?
MIKE => Will you tell us a story?
AMELIA => One and then you're going to sleep.
AMELIA =>  Once there was a hawk who wanted to fly higher than everyone else. He trained every day and hunted little birds so he could eat them and be strong.
MIKE => Pajaritos?     Little birds?
AMELIA => Of course, that's what hawks eat. So, one day the hawk flew so, so high that it crashed into an airplane. It fainted and started to fall. And when it was about to hit the ground, all the birds flew toward him and saved him.
DEBBIE => They saved him?
AMELIA => Yes, and when the hawk was healthy again he went to talk to the birds and said: I want to thank you for saving me, but I can't change and I'm going to keep hunting you. The little birds answered: we don't care that you hunt us, because that's who you are. But we will always save you, because that's who we are.
AMELIA =>  Did you like it?
DEBBIE => No.
DEBBIE => Leave it on.
AMELIA => Quedamos en que se iban a dormir con la luz apagada.
DEBBIE => But I'm scared.
AMELIA => No pasa nada.
DEBBIE => I'm scared that what happened to Pat is gonna happen to me.
AMELIA => A ti no te va a pasar eso...
DEBBIE => Pat died while she was sleeping.
AMELIA => That only happens to some babies when they're really little.
MIKE => Then why did daddy get so angry at mommy?
AMELIA => He wasn't angry, he was just very sad.
DEBBIE => He left.
AMELIA => Go to sleep. I'll sit here with you, but you can't talk anymore.
AMELIA => Yes...
RICHARD => Amelia, it's Richard. We're going to have to be here a few more days here in Morocco than we expected and Rachel wasn't able to find anyone to take care of the kids.
AMELIA => Your sister-in-law promised me to find someone.
RICHARD => Amelia, this is very serious.
AMELIA => It's because... I told Mrs. Jones three months ago that today is my son's wedding.
RICHARD => Amelia, this is an emergency. Cancel your son's wedding. I'll pay for another one.
AMELIA => Sir, everything is ready. Can't anyone come take care of the kids? It's just one day.
RICHARD => We need you, Amelia... hold on.
RICHARD => Amelia, we're really counting on you. I have to go. Goodbye.
AMELIA =>  Do you want another quesadilla?
DEBBIE => Mhh.
MIKE => How many little birds did the hawk eat?
AMELIA =>  None, because he started to like quesadillas.
DEBBIE => Is the bus here?
AMELIA =>  Yes, but today you're not going to school.
DEBBIE => Why?
AMELIA => We have things to do.
AMELIA =>  I just want you to take of them for today.
WOMAN => I can't, Mrs. Black is home.
AMELIA => And she won't go out?
WOMAN => No, I don't think so.
AMELIA => Ok, thanks.    I'll call you tomorrow.
LUCIA =>  I can't Amelia.
AMELIA => Please, it's my son's wedding. I helped you out with that thing with your boyfriend.
LUCIA => I really can't.
AMELIA => Just for the day, Lucia.   I'll be back for them tonight.
LUCIA => And what do I tell Mrs. Black?
AMELIA => Tell her they're your nephews.
LUCIA => Yeah right, they look just like me...with this gringa look I have.
MIKE => Are we going to see your house?
AMELIA => Yes, you're going to see my house.
MIKE => Is it far?
AMELIA =>  Not very.
SANTIAGO =>  Good morning Aunt Amelia.
AMELIA => Good morning.
SANTIAGO => Are they coming?
AMELIA => I couldn't find anyone to leave them with. Their parents aren't coming back today.
SANTIAGO => Why bring them, they're just going to make trouble.
AMELIA => They're good kids.
SANTIAGO => I know a woman who can take care of them.
AMELIA => Santiago, I have to take them. I can't leave them with just anybody.
SANTIAGO => What if you lose your job?
AMELIA => Come on, don't tempt the fates.
ANWAR =>  The Berbers built these kasbahs. They made them like forts and here they would reside after finishing their caravans.
RICHARD => This place is beautiful, don't you think?
SUSAN =>  Yeah, yeah it's very pretty...
ANWAR => Now, I'd like to show you the materials that were used to build the walls...
WAITER =>  You want to order?
RICHARD => I'll have a chicken cous-cous and a Coke, please.
SUSAN => What do you have that doesn't have fat in it?
WAITER => Everything is delicious.
SUSAN => I'll have the fried eggplant and a diet Coke.
WAITER => We don't have diet Coke.
SUSAN => Then a regular Coke.
RICHARD => Look, look: a hawk.
RICHARD => This country is incredible.
SUSAN => Richard, why did we come here?
RICHARD => What d'you mean why? I thought you would like it.
SUSAN => Really: why are we here?
RICHARD => To forget everything, to be alone.
SUSAN => Alone?
SUSAN => Throw out the ice.
RICHARD => The Coke is warm.
SUSAN => Yeah, but you don't know what kind of water is in there.
RICHARD => Why can't you ever relax.    You're always stressed.
SUSAN => You're the one stressing me out. You're why I can't relax.
RICHARD => You could if you tried.
SUSAN => Tried? Don't you think I tried?
RICHARD => You're never going to forgive me, are you?
SUSAN => Do you even know what I'm talking about?
RICHARD => Susan, please; we didn't come all this way just to argue.
SUSAN => Oh, we didn't? Then when are we supposed to "argue"? Or are you planning on running away again?
BOYS => Stilo...stilo...
BOYS => Stilo...stilo...
SUSAN => I don't have any money... I don't have any...
RICHARD => Here.
SUSAN => What are you doing?
RICHARD => Susan, what's wrong?
RICHARD => What happened?
RICHARD => Stop the bus, stop, my wife's been hurt.
CHIEKO =>  The ball was out.
REFEREE =>  No, it was good.
TEAMMATE => Let it go.
CHIEKO => That was out.
REFEREE => It was on the line.
CHIEKO => You're not just deaf, you're blind.
REFEREE => You're out.
CHIEKO => You're an asshole.
TEAMMATE 1 => You shouldn't have lost your temper. We lost the game.
CHIEKO => It wasn't my fault, it was the ref.
TEAMMATE 2 => If you hadn't been thrown out, we would've won the game.
TEAMMATE 1 => Why are you in a bad mood?
TEAMMATE 2 => She's always in a bad mood because nobody's fucked her yet.
CHIEKO => I'm gonna fuck your dad to get rid of my mood.
YASUJIRO => What do you want to eat?
CHIEKO => I said I'd meet my friends from the team at Eve's.
YASUJIRO => Weren't we going to have lunch together?
CHIEKO => Dad, I told you I was going to eat with them, but you never pay attention to me.
CHIEKO => My mother always paid attention to me.
YASUJIRO => Why do you want to fight?
YASUJIRO => I miss your mother too.
YASUJIRO => I'm doing what I can, sweetie.
YASUJIRO =>  Don't forget you have the dentist at four.
YASUJIRO =>  I love you very much.
HOSTESS => Do you have a table?
HOSTESS => Do you have a table?
CHIEKO => Why all the way in the corner?
MITSU => Because of the view.
MITSU => Do you like him?
YOUNG MAN => Hello.
YOUNG MAN => Can I play with you?
YOUNG MAN => Do you want to come have a drink?
CHIEKO => Tell him I couldn't read his lips.
MITSU =>  What's the matter?
CHIEKO =>  They look at us like we're monsters.
MITSU => Oh, come off it.
MITSU => What are you doing?
CHIEKO => Now they're going to meet the real hairy monster.
CHIEKO => I'll see you later at my place.
AHMED => Hurry up, man, hurry...
ZORA => What's wrong?
ZORA => I asked you what's wrong.
AHMED => What do you care, whore?
YUSSEF => Don't talk to her like that.
YUSSEF => Something we ate make us sick so we came back.
YASIRA => What are you doing here?
YUSSEF => Something we ate gave us a stomach ache.
YASIRA => And is that why you're insulting your sister?
YUSSEF => We were feeling really ill.
YASIRA => The goats are going to feel even worse if they don't eat. Take them out again.
AHMED => Our stomach really hurts.
YASIRA => Then start jerking the meat.
AHMED => D'you think something happened?
YUSSEF => I don't know.
AHMED => People were screaming.
AHMED => It was your fault.
YUSSEF => It was both our faults. We both shot.  Swear to me you'll never say anything.
YUSSEF => Swear.     Nobody, never.
AHMED => I swear.   Nobody.
ABDULLAH => Thank you, I'll see you tomorrow.
ABDULLAH => Tell your mother to prepare dinner.
YUSSEF => Mother, mother, father says he wants to have dinner now.
ABDULLAH => Did you kill any jackals?
YUSSEF => We shot at them, but didn't hit them.
ABDULLAH => You have to kill them. If not they're going to eat all the goats.
YASIRA => Why are you home so late?
ABDULLAH => They closed the road, and we had to take the long way around.  Apparently some terrorists killed an American tourist.
YASIRA => An American?
ABDULLAH => Yes, the terrorists attacked a tour bus on the road.
YASIRA => But there aren't any terrorists here.
ABDULLAH => You never know.
YUSSEF => And how do you know the American died?
ABDULLAH => That's what they were saying. The police are looking for the culprits.
SANTIAGO => See how easy it is to get into paradise?
DEBBIE => Is this Mexico?
AMELIA =>  Yes, this is Mexico.
MIKE => My mom told us Mexico is really dangerous.
SANTIAGO =>  Yes, it's full of Mexicans.
SANTIAGO =>  Are you hungry?
SANTIAGO => Do you like popsicles?
MIKE => What's this flavor called?
SANTIAGO =>  Cajeta... it's called cajeta.
MIKE =>  Cayeto...
SANTIAGO => No, cajeta... cajeta...
MIKE => Cajeto, cajeta... It's the best thing I've ever tasted in my life.  Can I buy some for my mom? She's gonna love them.
DEBBIE => Are they crashed cars?
AMELIA => Yes...
DEBBIE => Did lots of people die?
AMELIA => I guess so...
DEBBIE => I don't like Mexico.

RICHARD => Take it easy honey, take it easy.
SUSAN =>  I'm ok... I'm ok...
RICHARD => Is anybody a doctor?
RICHARD => Please: a doctor.
RICHARD => Where's the nearest hospital?
ANWAR => It's far away, about four hours.  There's a clinic that's a little closer, about an hour and a half to the south. By bus it'll take us about two hours and a half though.
RICHARD => Does that takes away from Marrakesh?
ANWAR => Yes, but it's the closest thing we've got.
RICHARD => I need your help. We were attacked.
OLD MAN =>  I don't understand...
RICHARD => Help... hospital...
OLD MAN =>  I don't understand you sir.

RICHARD => Shut up, god damn it!
SUSAN => It hurts, it hurts...
RICHARD => Easy, sweetie, easy...
SUSAN => It hurts... it hurts so much...
RICHARD =>  Isn't there anywhere else we can take her?

RICHARD => Ok.
ANWAR =>  Make a right onto the next road.
RICHARD => Are we here?
ANWAR => Yes sir, this is my house.

ANWAR =>  Hold and release the tourniquet every once in a while.
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER =>  Get out of here... out...
DOUGLAS => How is your wife?
RICHARD => Bad. Very bad.
TOM => Get her outta there and let's go.
RICHARD => And where should I take her?
TOM => In Egypt, in a town like this, they slit thirty German tourists' throats. They might do the same to us.
ANWAR => No, not here.
TOM =>  What do you know? We have to get out of here as soon as possible.
LILLY => It's very hot, sir, and the driver turned off the air conditioning. I'm feeling sick.
RICHARD => You can't leave us here.
JAMES => What's the use in staying?
RICHARD => In case I need the bus.
JAMES => They can go drop us off and then come back for you.
DOUGLAS => I'll stay with you if you need me.
ELYSE => And why would you stay?
RICHARD => Please wait.     Let me try to deal with this.

RICHARD => Call an ambulance...
ANWAR => I'll call Erfoud so they send one over.
RICHARD => And find a doctor...
ANWAR => They've already gone to look for him.
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER =>  Anwar, bring me some water.
MOHAMMED =>  Why did you bring them here?
MOHAMMED => You should have consulted with us.
ANWAR => She's hurt, we had to take care of her.
MOHAMMED => In town they're saying she was shot by terrorists. Do you know what they're going to do to us when they find out she's here?
ANWAR => Don't be paranoid and go help find the doctor.
SUSAN => Get me out of here... please...
RICHARD => I'm going to as soon as I can. I've already called Rachel; she's going to tell the embassy.
SUSAN => I told you we shouldn't have come.
RICHARD => How long until the ambulance gets here?
ANWAR => About an hour and a half. It's coming from Alnif.
RICHARD => That much? Isn't there anyone here who could take her?
RICHARD => We've got to get her out of here. There's no one to tend to her.
ANWAR => My brother already called a doctor, he's coming.
ANWAR => Trust my grandmother; she knows a lot about remedies.
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER =>  I have to clean you.
ANWAR =>  Miss, my grandmother is going to help you.
SUSAN => No, not that.
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER =>  It will stop the bleeding.

SHEIK =>  Tell him the federal police are in charge of this, that they are going to send the ambulance.
ANWAR => He says the federal police are already in charge, that they are going to send the ambulance.
SHEIK =>  Hey, did your cousin finally end up getting married?
ANWAR =>  Yep, she's married, she doesn't live here anymore.

CHIEKO => Believe it or not, I liked one of the cops.
MITSU => Did you put on some panties?

AHMED => The American... Yussef killed her...
YUSSEF => That's not true, we both did.
YASIRA => What are you saying?
AHMED => Yussef started shooting at the cars because Hassan said that the bullet could go really far...
YUSSEF => That's a lie, you started shooting at the cars.
AHMED => Yes, but you killed her.
ABDULLAH => What the hell are you talking about?
AHMED => Yussef killed the American and he spies on Zora naked and Zora lets him watch her...
ABDULLAH => What is your brother talking about?
ZORA => That's bullshit.
AHMED => It's not bullshit; she's a whore and my brother spies on her...
AMELIA =>  How many pots of rice did you make?
DAUGHTER 1 => I made two.

SANTIAGO => Let's see, Mike, you can help me.
SANTIAGO => Hold it tight, like this.

SANTIAGO =>  Aren't you going to help?
SANTIAGO => Why?
MIKE => It's not good to kill animals.

AMELIA => That happens when you're nervous.
MADRE => D'you think the baby's coming?
AMELIA => There's no way the baby's coming; she's only six months pregnant.
PATRICIA => But my belly feels hard, really hard.
AMELIA => D'you want to get married?
PATRICIA => Yes.
AMELIA => Well, let's go then.
MADRE => And what if the baby comes out?
AMELIA => Well, we'll have the wedding and baptize the kid while we're at it.
RICHARD => Thank you.
ANWAR => The doctor's here.
DOCTOR =>  Allah be with you.
ANWAR'S GRANDMOTHER =>  Allah be with you.
DOCTOR =>  The bullet didn't hit her spine or split her jugular. But it did shatter her clavicle and she could bleed to death.
RICHARD => What did he say?
ANWAR => He says she will be fine.
RICHARD => Stop lying to me god damn it, and tell me what the fuck he said!
DOCTOR => Hospital... need hospital...
RICHARD => Yes, we know that. What can you do in the meantime?
DOCTOR =>  Tell him I have to stitch up the wound to stop the bleeding.
ANWAR => He has to sew up her wounds.
SUSAN => What did he say?
RICHARD => You need some stitches.
SUSAN => What do you mean stitches?
RICHARD => You're not going to give her any anesthetic?
ANWAR =>  No, he doesn't use anesthetic.
RICHARD => What kind of doctor is he?
ANWAR => He's a veterinarian, but he is good.
RICHARD => He can't take care of her.
SUSAN => Richard, he might infect the wound...
DOCTOR =>  Tell him that if I don't stitch up her wound she may bleed to death.
ANWAR => If he doesn't sew up the wound, she may bleed to death.
DOCTOR =>  And tell him her clavicle is broken. We have to fasten a splint to it.
ANWAR => He says she has a broken bone and he has to put a splint on it.
DOCTOR =>  We're going to have to hold her down.
RICHARD => Honey, this is going to hurt a little.
SUSAN => Richard, don't let him...
SUSAN => Don't let him, don't let him.
RICHARD => Calm down... calm down... Susan, they have to sew you up... relax...
SUSAN => No, no...no..
RICHARD => Honey, please try to relax...
MOHAMMED => I don't understand why Anwar brought them here.
FRIEND 1 => Well he spends all his time with them, what do you expect.
FRIEND 2 => The woman is hurt, he had to help her.
MOHAMMED => Yeah?   And when have they helped us?
FRIEND 1 => I liked one of those tourists.
FRIEND 2 => Really?   They're all skin and bones.
MOHAMMED => Shh... sh... listen.
NEWSCASTER => Today, near Tazarine, there was an incident where an American was shot...
FRIEND 3 => Hey look, it's the story.
FRIEND 2 => They said Tazarine, did you hear? We were on the radio...
MOHAMMED => Shh, shut up.
NEWSCASTER => Although authorities say it could have been a foiled robbery, the American government claims they are certain it was a terrorist attack. Minister Hassef Hazal has said that in our country, terrorist cells have been eradicated, that Morocco is a peaceful country and that one act of vulgar banditry followed by superficial evaluations such as the U.S. intends to place upon it cannot ruin the image, the economy and the pacifist reputation of our country. American Ambassador Ken Jones, however, insists that it was a terrorist attack on American citizens, that it merits a full investigation, and that the guilty should be punished. So far, the attack has not been attributed to any known terrorist organizations...
MOHAMMED => I fucking told Anwar, I told him he was only going to get us in trouble... he never comes and when he does he always brings trouble...god damn it...
FRIEND 1 => Are the Americans going to invade our country?
MOHAMMED => I don't know.
SUSAN => I hate you... I hate you...
DOCTOR =>  Tell her not to move; the bullet's still inside.
ANWAR =>  Don't move, miss. The bullet is still inside you.
SUSAN => I don't give a shit...
RICHARD => My love, don't move.
SUSAN => I want to call the kids.
RICHARD => You can't move, calm down.
SUSAN => I want to talk to them.
RICHARD => You can't; there's only one phone in town. I'll call them later.
SUSAN => I want to talk to them...
JANE =>  Are you ok?
JANE =>  Could you please turn on the air conditioning?
DRIVER =>  No air condition, no gasoline near. I'm sorry.
JANE =>  My husband is feeling ill.     You have to turn it on.
DRIVER =>  No possible. No gasoline near.      I'm sorry.
LILLY =>  Please, it's too hot.   We can get dehydrated.
DRIVER =>  I'm really sorry, forgive me, but gasoline finish with air conditioner.
TOM => What is he saying?
JANE => That he can't turn on the air conditioning, that it's not possible.
TOM => Fuck you.   We're gettin' out of here.
TOM => We've gotta talk to you.
TOM => We're leaving.
RICHARD => You can't leave us like this.
TOM => There are old people here and the heat is getting to them.
RICHARD => At least wait until an ambulance comes.
TOM => One man almost fainted in the bus and there's a woman who needs to get back in time to take her medication.
RICHARD => Is there anyone around here who can take them in?
TOM => It's not about that.
LILLY => Sir, we can't wait anymore.
WALTER => We can't leave him here alone.
TOM => Well let him come, then.
DOUGLAS => His wife is in no condition to ride a bus.
TOM => And lots of other people aren't in any condition to keep waiting, can't you see?
RICHARD => Just wait, the ambulance should be here any minute now.
TOM => We're giving you an hour... one hour...
KUMIKO => They're my cousins.
CHIEKO => Is he deaf-mute like us?
KUMIKO => No, but he understands some.
HARUKI => What's your name?
HARUKI => Chieko?
HARUKI => My name's Haruki.
HARUKI => It's whisky.
HARUKI => Do the cops come around here?
MITSU =>  Sometimes.
TAKESHI => Why- don't- we- go- to- Montana?
DOORMAN => Good evening, how may I help you?
DOORMAN => Very well miss, I'll call him now.
DOORMAN => Lieutenant Kenji Mamiya, please?
DOORMAN => Lieutenant? Yes, look, I'm with the deaf-mute girl you saw in the afternoon, and she asked me to call you... Yes, her... She says she needs to talk to you, alone... about her father... If it's possible, in her apartment, tonight.
ABDULLAH => Why did you do this?
ABDULLAH => Answer me, god damn it!
YUSSEF => We were testing the rifle.
ABDULLAH => Are you idiots? You killed a woman,  And you, you got naked so your brother would see you?
AHMED => Yes, she got naked lots of times.    I saw how Yussef spied on her.
ZORA => That's not true.
ABDULLAH => Is it true or not?
ABDULLAH => Why did you do this to us?
ABDULLAH => Where's the rifle?
COP => What organization gave you the weapon?
HASSAN => I've told you it wasn't an organization; I got it from a hunter.
COP => What hunter?
HASSAN => A Japanese hunter gave it to me many years ago. I've got a picture inside. She can get it.
HASSAN => He's holding the rifle he gave me.
ABDULLAH => We're going to hide out at Naguib's house. If the cops come, tell them we went south.
ALARID => This Abdullah doesn't live where you said he did.
WIFE => They live where he said they do.
ALARID => You're going to take us.
ALARID => And if they're not there, I'll cut your tongue out and I'll kill your husband.
WIFE => Make a right here.
WIFE => That's them.
ALARID =>  Stop...
ALARID => There they are.
YUSSEF => The police, the police...
YUSSEF => They're shooting at us.
ABDULLAH => Get down.   Run.
AHMED => They shot me, they shot me...
ABDULLAH => Don't shoot, don't shoot!
SANTIAGO =>  Like this, look...
JACINTO =>  Amelia, will you let me dance with you?
JACINTO => I've been asking you for a dance for 30 years. Does it really cost you that much?
AMELIA => I don't think your wife would have liked that.
JACINTO => C'mon Amelia, she's been dead for 10 years.
AMELIA => Okay, just one.
GUITAR PLAYER =>  Now, Luis and Patricia, come forward.
GUITAR PLAYER => We-want-cake, we-want-cake...
GUITAR PLAYER => Take- a- bite, take- a- bite...
AMELIA => Don't worry, it's ok.
LUIS => Good evening everyone... Hey... I want to say something. Love came today, it came here all pretty...  It's kind of like a little mouse is crawling inside of me. Because that's what love is, it's like your insides get all twisted into knots... and that, baby, is what you've taught me. And because you've shown me, I want to tell everyone that hopefully love will get inside them too...because it feels so good, really...Thanks a lot and keep havin' a good time...

MOHAMMED =>  What happened?
POLICEMAN =>  I need to talk to the American.
TOM => What did he say?
MOHAMMED => No English...
RICHARD =>  When did he find out?
ANWAR =>  When did you know?
POLICEMAN =>  A while ago... they said the ambulance isn't coming anymore.
ANWAR => A while ago... he says the ambulance broke down.
RICHARD => What? Tell him to call another one. He has to get another one.
ANWAR =>  He wants you to call another ambulance.
POLICEMAN =>  You know there isn't another one.
ANWAR =>  There isn't another ambulance.
RICHARD => What the hell do you mean there isn't another ambulance? You've got to get her out of here...
RICHARD => She can't stay here or she'll die. Call another fucking ambulance...
RICHARD => Come on, move... call another ambulance...
ANWAR =>  He asks how we're going to get the woman out of here.
POLICEMAN =>  Tell him that they told me that his embassy is going to deal with it.
ANWAR => He says your embassy will deal with the matter.
RICHARD => How the fuck are they going to deal with it? It's your shitty fucking country's responsibility.
POLICEMAN =>  The Americans want to send one of their helicopters but I think there are some problems.
ANWAR => They're going to try to send a helicopter.
RICHARD =>  A helicopter?... Let's get out of here...
ANWAR => Where?
RICHARD => I need to make a phone call.
TOM => We can't stay here any longer. It's going to get dark soon. Lots of people aren't feeling well and its dangerous to stay here.
RICHARD => Stop fucking with me.
TOM => Don't you dare push me.
RICHARD => Oh no?
TOM => What are you doing, you stupid fuck?
RICHARD => Leave asshole.
TOM => Fuck you.
JAMES => Hey, take it easy.
RICHARD => I'm fed up with that asshole.

RACHEL => What d'you mean dying?

RACHEL => Mark, your business partner, already called someone in the Secretary of State, they're going to help you...
RICHARD => You can't just make these stupid fucking calls, you've got to do something...
RACHEL => Richard calm down, we're doing everything we can.

RICHARD => God damn it, connect the fucking call.
MARK => Richard, it's Mark.
RICHARD => Mark, help me... Susan is dying and there are no ambulances, there's no hospital, there's nothing.
MARK => Richard, the news is all over the place. They're going to go help you, soon, but there have been some political problems that are being resolved.
RICHARD => I don't give a shit about political problems... Do something, now, please...
RICHARD => Son of a bitch...
MARK => Richard... what happened? Richard, answer me...
RICHARD => Stop... Stop... Stop you mother- fuckers stop...
KENJI => Hello.
KENJI => They told me you wanted to talk to me.
KENJI => I'm sorry. Is there something you wanted to tell me?
KENJI => Do you have tea?
KENJI => "My father had nothing to do with my mother's death," what's this?
KENJI => Your father was asleep when she jumped off the balcony?
KENJI => You saw her jump?
KENJI => You've already told the other officers?
KENJI => I don't know what you're talking about.
KENJI => It's about a hunting rifle in his name.
KENJI => Does your father still hunt?
KENJI => There was an incident with a rifle in your father's name. That's why we want to talk to him.
KENJI => No, your father isn't going to jail. We just need to talk to him.
KENJI => I have to go now. Thank you.
KENJI => I have to go.
KENJI => What are you doing?
KENJI => No, no, no... this is wrong.

POLICE OFFICER => A boy is walking this way.
ALARID => Is he armed?
POLICE OFFICER => It doesn't look like it.
ALARID => What are the others doing?
POLICE OFFICER => A man is holding somebody injured.
ALARID => Is the other one still walking this way?
POLICE OFFICER => Yes.
ALARID => Aim.
YUSSEF => I killed the American, I was the only one who shot at you...
YUSSEF => They did nothing... nothing...
YUSSEF => Kill me, but save my brother, he did nothing... nothing...
ALARID => On the ground...
YUSSEF => Save my brother...
ALARID => On the ground...
YUSSEF => Save my brother... please...
ALARID => Go help them.
MIKE => I can't walk anymore.
AMELIA => We have to keep walking.
MIKE => Why is the air so hot?
AMELIA =>  Because coyotes and snakes and quails have already breathed that air.
MIKE => We're breathing the same air animals breathe?
AMELIA => Yes.
MIKE => And it doesn't rot?
AMELIA => No, it doesn't rot.   We all breathe this air.
DEBBIE => I can't anymore. I'm thirsty.
MIKE => So am I.
AMELIA =>  Just a little further and we'll go look for water.
AMELIA =>  We're going to rest here for a while.
MIKE => What if there are snakes?
AMELIA => No, there aren't any.   Come, lie down.
MIKE => What happening?
AMELIA =>  Stay still.
MIKE => Why are we hiding if we didn't do anything wrong?
AMELIA =>  Because they think we did something wrong.
MIKE => That's not true: you're bad.
AMELIA => No, sweetie, I'm not bad.     I just did something stupid.
AMELIA =>  I love you very much, sweetie.
AMELIA =>  Debbie, we've got to go.
AMELIA => Debbie, sweetheart, wake up.
AMELIA => Sweetie, I'm going to go look for help. Stay here and don't move.
MIKE => I'm not staying here alone.
AMELIA => Honey, you have to take care of Debbie.
MIKE => I'm going with you.
AMELIA => I won't be long. I promise.
AMELIA =>  Stop, stop...
AMELIA => Sir... sir... stop...
AMELIA => Please help me.
AMELIA => I have to go get two kids I left behind in the desert.
JOHN =>  Are they illegal immigrants?
AMELIA => No, they're American.
JOHN => When did you cross?
AMELIA =>  I didn't cross, I live here.   Please, help me find these kids.
JOHN => Stand there and don't move.
JOHN => Attention base, I have a 4533...I have the suspect.
JOHN => You're under arrest. Turn around and put your hands behind your head.
AMELIA => I left those kids in the desert, I swear.
JOHN => Turn around, now.
JOHN => Which way are they?
AMELIA =>  Over there.
JOHN => Where are they?
AMELIA => They must be around here.
ELISEO => What happened?
JOHN => This lady said they were here, but there's nobody.
ELISEO =>  Ma'am, you're not lying to us, are you?
AMELIA =>  I swear they're around here somewhere.
AMELIA => They must be over that way.
JOHN => There's nobody here.
AMELIA =>  I left them about a kilometer in from the road.
ELISEO =>  Which road?
JOHN => I don't believe you.
AMELIA =>  I swear they're around here.
ELISEO =>  John, wait, maybe she's telling the truth.
JOHN => Maybe she's not, let's go.
AMELIA => Please sir, believe me.
AMELIA =>  I swear, they're lost, they're going to die. I have to find them.
AMELIA =>  Please no... please...
SUSAN => Richard.
RICHARD => What do you need?
SUSAN => Richard... if I die, take care of the kids. Especially Mike, he really needs you.
RICHARD => You're not going to die. You can't die. You just can't.
SUSAN => Don't ever leave them again.
RICHARD => No, I'm not going to leave them and don't you even think about leaving me, because I'll kill you like nobody's killed you before.
SUSAN => I peed my pants.
RICHARD => What?
SUSAN => I couldn't hold it in and I peed.
RICHARD => I'm going to tell Mike on you, so you never scold him again.
SUSAN => I need to pee again.
RICHARD =>  Do you have a pot I can borrow?
RICHARD =>  Can you leave us alone for a moment?
RICHARD => Come, try it like this.
SUSAN => I can't.
SUSAN => Now I can.
RICHARD => Forgive me my love. When Pat died I didn't know what to do, the pain drove me crazy... I was scared, that's why I left... forgive me.
SUSAN => I was scared too... when I saw Pat lying still in his crib...
SUSAN => It wasn't my fault, it wasn't... I couldn't do anything for him...
RICHARD => No, it wasn't your fault. I was wrong...
RICHARD => Shhh... it wasn't your fault my love, it wasn't anybody's fault... Pat just left...  Forgive me, please.
SUSAN => Forgive me for not forgiving you.
RICHARD => You missed; you got my leg.
RICHARD => Does it hurt?
SUSAN => So much... so much...
RICHARD => Anwar...Anwar...
ANWAR => What happened?
RICHARD => We've got to get her out of here. Where's the clinic?
ANWAR => In Alnif, an hour and a half away from here.
RICHARD => Can you get us a car we can take her in?
RICHARD => My love... I'm going to get you out of here.   We're going to try to take you to a clinic an hour and a half away from here. Do you think you can make it?
SUSAN => Yeah.
RICHARD => I need you to be strong. Really strong.
RICHARD => Thank you for lending us the car.
ANWAR =>  He thanks you for lending us the car.
SUSAN => Ahhh... Ahhh...
RICHARD => Sweetie, you've got to hold on.
TENDERO =>  Stop... Stop...
TENDERO =>  They're calling from the American Embassy.
RICHARD => Hello...
SECRETARY => Just a moment, I'm going to put you through to ambassador Ken Clifford.
KEN => Hello, Richard Jones?
RICHARD => Yes, speaking.
KEN => I'm very sorry about what happened to your wife, but you can be sure that the culprits will be punished.
RICHARD => My wife is dying. She's in urgent need of medical attention.
KEN => We're working on it...
RICHARD => We've been here for five hours. What the fuck are you waiting for?
KEN => The Moroccan government won't let us use their airspace. They refused to acknowledge that this was an act of terrorism...
RICHARD => I can't wait anymore... I'm taking my wife to a clinic in Tinerhir right now...
KEN => Stay put... we've settled the matter. A helicopter should arrive soon...
RICHARD => We can't wait any longer.
KEN => The helicopter is on its way. Don't move.
RICHARD => My wife is in critical condition. How long is the chopper going to take?
KEN => Soon... it'll be there soon... Be patient, it won't be long.
POLICE OFFICER =>  Is your full name Amelia Gloria Jordn Susilla?
AMELIA =>  Yes sir.
POLICE OFFICER => Do you understand English?
AMELIA =>  Yes sir.
POLICE OFFICER =>  Ma'am, it was a miracle that we found those kids. I don't know how you could leave them alone in the desert.
AMELIA => I had to look for help.
POLICE OFFICER => Your reckless behavior endangered their lives.
AMELIA => How are they?
POLICE OFFICER => That's none of your business, ma'am.
POLICE OFFICER => You've committed serious crimes.
AMELIA => I just took the kids to my son's wedding.
POLICE OFFICER => No ma'am, you did not just do that. You took them to another country without their parents' permission and you put them in danger.
AMELIA => Sir, I raised these kids since they were born. I take care of them day and night. I feed them breakfast, lunch and dinner. I play with them. Mike and Debbie are like my own children.
POLICE OFFICER =>  But they are not your kids, ma'am.
AMELIA => What about my nephew, Santiago?
POLICE OFFICER => I don't have any information on him.
POLICE OFFICER => We located the parents in Morocco. They're very angry, but they've decided not to raise charges.
POLICE OFFICER => Nevertheless, the government of the United States has deemed you were seriously breaking the law and has decided to immediately and definitively deport you.
AMELIA => I've been living here for fifteen years. My things are here, I rent a house, I made my life here.
POLICE OFFICER => You should've thought of that beforehand.
AMELIA => I want to talk to a lawyer.
POLICE OFFICER => If you attempt to take this to court, I assure you you will end up in jail. If you want my advice, accept the deportation and never come back.
AMELIA =>  Do you have a cigarette?
AMELIA => Thank you.
ANWAR => Good luck, mister...
RICHARD => Thank you for everything.
ANWAR => No sir, no... Allah be with you.
REPORTER => In this helicopter is Susan Jones, an American mother of two who was seriously injured in a terrorist attack. It appears fundamentalist organizations planned the attack...
KEN => Mr. Jones, I'm Ken Clifford, Ambassador to the United States.
KEN => A first rate medical team is going to tend to her, but if you want we can take her to a hospital in Italy as soon as she's stable...
RICHARD => Thank you...
KEN => There are lots of reporters waiting. Is there anything you want to say to the press? A statement against terrorism?
RICHARD => The last thing I'm worried about right now is the fucking press.
MOROCCAN DOCTOR =>  We're going to have to operate immediately.
RICHARD => Is she going to be ok?
MOROCCAN DOCTOR => It's probable. We're going to try to save her arm.   She's been bleeding internally, and there's been some clotting so there's a high risk of gangrene.
RICHARD =>  But she's going to be ok?
MOROCCAN DOCTOR => Yes, she's going to be ok.
RICHARD => Amelia?
AMELIA => Yes sir.
RICHARD => How is everything?
AMELIA => Ok sir, Mrs. Rachel told me. I'm very sorry. How is Mrs. Susan?
RICHARD => They're going to operate now... Amelia... take good care of the kids, and don't tell them anything...
AMELIA => No sir, don't worry.
RICHARD => Put Mike on please.
MIKE => Hi dad.
RICHARD => Hey sweetie, how are you?
MIKE => Dad, guess what? Today, at school, they brought some baby chickens.
RICHARD => Oh really?
MIKE => I held one in my hand. He was really little and he was all warm.
MIKE => Dad, are you ok?
RICHARD => Yeah, I'm ok. Everything's fine.
MIKE => And Mariana wanted to take one home, but the teacher didn't let her...
KENJI => You don't have to apologize for anything.
KENJI => Good night.
DOORMAN => Officer... officer...
DOORMAN => This is the man you were looking for.
KENJI => Good evening, I'm lieutenant Mamiya.
YASUJIRO => Good evening, how can I help you?
KENJI => Sir, there was an incident and...
KENJI => I don't mean to bother you, but...  Do you own a .270 caliber Winchester 70 rifle with the registration number...
KENJI => UK-9023?
YASUJIRO => I don't remember the license, but I did have a rifle like the one you described.
KENJI => Is it true that you gave it to a Mr. Hassan Ibrahim, who lives in southern Morocco?
YASUJIRO => Hassan Ibrahim?
KENJI => He says he was your guide in a hunt.
YASUJIRO => Hassan? Of course. He was a very good guide and I gave him the rifle. Hassan is a very kind man. Did anything happen?
KENJI => There was an attempted murder with that rifle, and the Moroccan police want to confirm it's not off the black market.
YASUJIRO => No, I gave it to him.  Is Hassan ok?
KENJI => I don't know.
YASUJIRO => Am I legally involved?
KENJI => Not for the moment. You may have to go testify for your friend.
YASUJIRO => Can I leave now?
KENJI => Good night.
KENJI => Excuse me.
