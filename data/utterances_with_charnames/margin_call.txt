SETH => Is that them?
PETER => 
SETH => Jesus Christ.
SETH => Are they going to do it right there?
PETER => Yeah.
SETH => Fuck me.
WILL EMERSON =>  Have you guys ever seen this before?
SETH => No.
WILL EMERSON => Best to just ignore it. Keep your head down and get back to work... and don't watch.
HEATHER => Timothy Singh?
TIMOTHY => Yes.
HEATHER => I'm afraid we have to speak with you.
HEATHER => Eric Dale?
PETER => Excuse me?
HEATHER => Eric Dale?
PETER => No.
HEATHER => Sorry?
PETER => I'm not Eric Dale.
HEATHER => Oh. I'm so sorry.
PETER => He's my boss, he's down that hall.
HEATHER => Mr. Dale?
ERIC => Yes.
HEATHER => This way.
LAUREN BRATBERG => Well... Mr. Dale I'm obviously sorry that we are here today but these are extra ordinary times as you very well must know.
ERIC => I run risk management... it just doesn't seem like a natural place to start cutting.
HEATHER => I hope you understand that this is in no way personal. A majority of this floor is being let go today.
ERIC => OK
HEATHER => Mr. Dale. Ms. Bratberg is now going to run through the details of what the firm is offering.
ERIC => OK
LAUREN BRATBERG => Mr. Dale the firm is offering you six months severance at half your salary. You will keep all unvested options that you currently hold. Health will be extended through that period. You have till tomorrow at...
LAUREN BRATBERG => 4:47 to either take the offer or it will be revoked. Do you understand?
ERIC => Yes.
LAUREN BRATBERG => Now, unfortunately Mr. Dale due to the highly sensitive nature of your work here the firm has to take certain precautions for security purposes that may seem punitive in nature. I hope considering your...
LAUREN BRATBERG => ...over 19 years of service to the firm, you will understand that these measures are in no way a reflection of the firms' feelings towards your performance or your character.
ERIC => I'm sorry??
HEATHER => She's apologizing for what's about to happen.
LAUREN BRATBERG => Your company email, access to the server, access to the building, and your mobile data and phone service will all be severed as of this meeting. This gentleman...
LAUREN BRATBERG => will take you to your office so that you can clear out your personal belongings.
ERIC => What about my current ongoing work? I'm right in the...
LAUREN BRATBERG => The firm has worked out its transition plan and is prepared to move forward, but we appreciate your concern.
HEATHER => We understand that this is very difficult and here is my card. Please contact me over the next few weeks if there is anything that I can do to help you through this transition in your life.
SECURITY GUARD => Sir?
WILL EMERSON => Hey.
ERIC => Will.
WILL EMERSON => I'm very sorry.
ERIC => Are you still alive?
WILL EMERSON => For now.
ERIC => Congratulations.
WILL EMERSON => It's a total bloodbath.
ERIC => I heard.
WILL EMERSON => If there was anything I coulda done, you know I woulda done it.
ERIC => I know.
WILL EMERSON => Well...
ERIC => One more thing... Who was it?
WILL EMERSON => Eric...
ERIC => Was it Rogers?
WILL EMERSON => You know me. I'm not gonna say...
ERIC => Robertson?
ERIC => That cunt. I knew it. I never should have gone to her last year.
WILL EMERSON => Look it wasn't anyone. It's just bad luck. Right....?
ERIC => Yeah.
WILL EMERSON => Good luck.
ERIC => Will?
WILL EMERSON => Yeah.
ERIC => You know I was just in the middle of a bunch of shit here that someone should really take a look at.
WILL EMERSON => Eric, they are telling us that everyone has got to get out of here and leave everything behind. While we appreciate your concern, this is not your problem anymore. Alright? Good luck.
PETER => Eric, I am very sorry.
SETH => Yeah. Did they say what was going to happen with us?
PETER => Jesus Seth.
SETH => What?
ERIC => No, it will be ugly around here for a while but you guys will be fine...
SETH => Well, take care, Eric.
ERIC => Well, I'll be seeing you around.
PETER => I just wanted to say thank you.
ERIC => That's not necessary.
PETER => Well it is... You were the person around here that I...
ERIC => I know.
ERIC => I was close to something here... But they wouldn't let me finish it. Take a look.
ERIC => Be careful.
WILL EMERSON => Well, that was fucking hideous.
SAM ROGERS => It's gonna get worse before it gets better.
WILL EMERSON => Really?
SAM ROGERS => Much.
WILL EMERSON => Got any nicorettes? I'm out of nicorettes, which means I'm gonna kill someone in about 10 minutes... You alright?
SAM ROGERS => My dog is dying.
WILL EMERSON => I'm sorry?
SAM ROGERS => Just spoke to the vet, it's some fucking tumor on her liver. I'm paying almost a thousand bucks a day to keep her alive.
WILL EMERSON => Really?
SAM ROGERS => Yeah... and I don't have a clue what to do about it.
WILL EMERSON => Well they're all gone.
SAM ROGERS => How many do we have left?
WILL EMERSON => Thirty-three.
SAM ROGERS => Make sure everyone is out there, I need to say something.
WILL EMERSON => They are ready for you.
SAM ROGERS => You are all still here for a reason... Most of this floor was just sent home... forever. We have spent the last hour saying good-bye... they were good people and they were good at their jobs... but you all were better. Now they are gone. They are not to be thought of again. This is your opportunity. On every floor of this building and in every office from Hong Kong to London the same thing is happening. Before this is all done 3 of every ten guys who were standing between you and your boss's job are now gone. That is your opportunity. I've been at this place for thirty-four years and let me tell you that this will not be the last time you go through this. But you all are survivors... And that is how this firm over 107 years has always continued to grow stronger. So hold your heads high... and get back to work.
ERIC => Robertson!
ERIC => Sarah Robertson!
ERIC => You shut off my phone???
SARAH ROBERTSON => Eric... I didn't do anything.
ERIC => Fuck you.
SETH => You ok?
PETER => Yeah. Just a little freaked out.
SETH => You want to get a drink?
PETER => Nah, I need to clean up a few things around here.
SETH => Everyone is going out... come on.
PETER => Nah, I'm fine.
SETH => Well, give me a call if you change your mind.
PETER => I will.
SETH => Come on.
PETER => Where are you going?
SETH => The Grand.
PETER => I'll call you when I'm done.
SETH => Be glad, you're still alive.
PETER => I am.
PETER =>  Come on, come on.
OPERATOR RECORDING => The number you have called has been disconnected and is no longer in service.
PETER => Fuck.
SETH => Hello.
PETER => I can't hear you.
SETH => What.
PETER => Go outside, I can't hear you.
SETH => Wait... Give me a sec... OK.
PETER => Where are you?
SETH => Lugo.
PETER => Are you with Will?
SETH => Emerson?
PETER => Yes.
SETH => I think he's still here. Why?
PETER => You have to go get him, and get back up here.
SETH => Where?
PETER => The office.
SETH => What!
PETER => I'm serious.
SETH => You want me to get our boss's boss out of a club and bring him back to the office at 10:00 on a Thursday night?
PETER => Our boss just got axed, so technically he is our boss, and yes.
SETH => Why?
PETER => Just do it Seth.
SETH => Alright, we'll be there in ten.
WILL EMERSON => Hey, look who it is, burning the candle at both ends. There aren't anymore cuts planned though, so you can stop kissing my ass, honestly I don't even understand what you guys do.
PETER => Will, I am so sorry to call you back but I really think..
WILL EMERSON => Don't worry about it.
SETH => Hey.
SETH => What's going on?
PETER => Look at this.
PETER => Eric gave me this file before he left.
SETH => Eric?
PETER => Dale. And he told me he couldn't quite figure it out, then the last thing he says as the doors on the elevator close is `be careful'.
WILL EMERSON => Be careful?
PETER => So I'm obviously a little curious. So I get into it a bit and I realize that all he was missing was...well it's not good.
SETH => What is he doing here?
PETER => Go to model four, and it makes more sense.
SETH => Oh.
WILL EMERSON => What is this?
PETER => This is basically everything that we have on our books at any given time. But what Eric was trying to do here is work it for levels of volatility that fall outside the limits of our standard VAR model.
WILL EMERSON => What are those levels.
PETER => Well it's a fairly complicated...
WILL EMERSON => Simplify.
PETER => The volatility boundaries are basically set using historic patterns then stretching them out another 10-15%... roughly.
WILL EMERSON => So what's happening?
SETH => We are starting to test those historic patterns.
WILL EMERSON => When?
PETER => Today.
SETH => Tuesday.
PETER => Monday, last Friday, last Wednesday and Monday.
SETH => Two Fridays ago.
WILL EMERSON => I get it.
SETH => Fuck me... Once this thing gets going in the wrong direction...
PETER => Yeah...
SETH => It's huge.
WILL EMERSON => How huge?
SETH => The losses are greater than the current value of the company...?
PETER => Projected losses... projected...
SETH => Fuck me.
PETER => Yeah.
WILL EMERSON => Wait, and this is just our floor?
PETER => Yeah...
WILL EMERSON => Where the fuck is Eric Dale?
PETER => I can't find him, they cut off his phone.
WILL EMERSON => What?
PETER => They turned off everyone's phone who they axed today.
WILL EMERSON => Fucking ruthless. And he's got no other cell?
PETER => No.
WILL EMERSON => How does he not have his own cellphone?
PETER => I tried, it's been turned off.
WILL EMERSON => I think I have his home number.
PETER => You're going to call his house?
WILL EMERSON => Yes... Do we even know if he's right?
PETER => It seems pretty fucking right to me.
SETH => It does.
WILL EMERSON => Hello, Mrs. Dale?... This is Will Emerson calling... I'm fine, thanks. I was wondering if Eric was there?... Yes, we tried but his cell doesn't seem to be working...   19   CONTINUED:                                                      19 WILL EMERSON Ok, could you have him call me the moment he gets home, the moment he arrives? Thank you very much.
WILL EMERSON => Where the fuck is he?
SETH => Doesn't he have like three kids?
WILL EMERSON => So?
SETH => I'm just saying, would you go home?
WILL EMERSON => I know where he is. You two need to go get him.
PETER => Now?
WILL EMERSON => Yes.
WILL EMERSON => There will be a car waiting for you downstairs. Get him back here.
PETER => What are you going to do?
WILL EMERSON => I'm calling Sam.
PETER => Fuck me.
WILL EMERSON => Go.
SAM ROGERS => It's 11:00 at night?
WILL EMERSON => I know I'm sorry. I wouldn't have called...
SAM ROGERS => What's the problem?
WILL EMERSON => I think you need to get down here.
SAM ROGERS => What?
WILL EMERSON => Sam...
SAM ROGERS => It's 11:00 o'clock.
WILL EMERSON => I am well aware of the fucking time, Sam. But you need to see this.
SAM ROGERS => See what?
WILL EMERSON => Well...
SAM ROGERS => Email it to me.
WILL EMERSON => I don't think that is a good idea.
SAM ROGERS => I'm on my way.
SETH => You want one?
PETER => No.
SETH => What, we got them on our way to meet you at the office... we didn't know what the fuck you wanted to talk about...  ... thought you might've gotten some chick pregnant or something.
PETER => I haven't gotten laid in so long that's not possible at this point.
SETH => I guess that's true.
PETER => Look at these people.
SETH => What?
PETER => We are in here stressing our fucking heads off that the world as we know it is ending, and they've got no idea what's coming.
PETER => Right?
SETH => I try not to let work get to me.
PETER => I've noticed that about you actually.
SETH => Look, we are twenty three years old...
PETER => Twenty-Seven.
SETH => Whatever, same thing, I made almost a quarter of a million dollars last year... for what... pushing some numbers around on a computer screen, so a bunch of glorified crack addicts could take that information and pretend to understand it, and then make a bet against some other jock half way around the world who if he wasn't doing this would probably be in some OTB somewhere putting it all on number seven. And at the end of the day one guy loses and the other guy wins.
PETER => You do know it's a little more complicated than that?
SETH => It's Will... He wants to know if we've found him? What do I tell him.
PETER => Tell him that we haven't found him.
SAM ROGERS => Hey.
WILL EMERSON => Hey.
SAM ROGERS => So?
WILL EMERSON => Eric Dale...
SAM ROGERS => Oh Jesus...
WILL EMERSON => Before he was escorted out of the building by security...
SAM ROGERS => I had nothing to do with that.
WILL EMERSON => I know.
SAM ROGERS => I'm sorry, go on.
WILL EMERSON => So as he was leaving the building he hands a disk to Peter Sullivan...
SAM ROGERS => Who's Peter Sullivan again?
WILL EMERSON => One of Eric's guys.
SAM ROGERS => Right.
WILL EMERSON => ...and tells him that he was almost on to something but hasn't been able to figure it out. So he gives him the disk and says give it a try... but the last thing he says as the doors to the elevator close is `be careful'...
SAM ROGERS => Be careful?
WILL EMERSON => Yeah.
SAM ROGERS => Be careful?
WILL EMERSON => Yes.
SAM ROGERS => Why?
WILL EMERSON => Well... take a look.
SAM ROGERS => Speak, you know I can't read those fucking things they put together.
WILL EMERSON => Basically the kid dives right into the thing after your little pep talk, nice job by the way, and he seems to have nailed it.
SAM ROGERS => Nailed it?
WILL EMERSON => The kid figured out what Eric was missing. And...
SAM ROGERS => And?
WILL EMERSON => ...it isn't good.
WILL EMERSON => As far as I can tell these here are the historical volatility index limits... which I guess our whole fucking trading model relies on pretty heavily... and we are so fucking levered up that if this thing starts getting outside those limits it gets ugly in a hurry.
SAM ROGERS => How ugly?
WILL EMERSON => Real ugly.
SAM ROGERS => And how close to those limits have we gotten?
WILL EMERSON => Oh we're beyond close... We broke through five or six days over the last two weeks, but we've managed to stay on the upside of it... for now...
SAM ROGERS => For now?
WILL EMERSON => Well look what happens here when we get on the wrong side of it.
SAM ROGERS => What am I looking at?
WILL EMERSON => And that wouldn't even be that bad a day for us... historically speaking.
SAM ROGERS => Is this right?
WILL EMERSON => I don't know.
SAM ROGERS => Where is Eric?
WILL EMERSON => We shut his phone off.
SAM ROGERS => Of course we did.
WILL EMERSON => And he hasn't come home yet, I spoke to his wife.
SAM ROGERS => He's probably crying in a fucking beer somewhere.
WILL EMERSON => Or worse.
SAM ROGERS => Where's the kid who did this?
WILL EMERSON => Out looking for Eric.
SAM ROGERS => Do we think he knows what he's doing?
WILL EMERSON => I don't know. What do I know?
SAM ROGERS => Well get him back here.
PETER => What now?
SETH => We should probably tell Will he's not here.
PETER => Yeah.
SETH => What do you think this girl makes in a night?
PETER => Seth.
SETH => 1500?
SETH => 2000? Fuck. That's.... All things considered, that's not bad.
SETH => Will?... No, no, we asked and no one's seen him.
SETH => He's freaking out. We need to get down there.
SETH => What'a you think Rogers makes in a year?
PETER => I have no idea?
SETH => Come on, play along.
PETER => I don't know what year?
SETH => Last year.
PETER => Three quarters of a million bucks?
SETH => Come on.
PETER => What?
SETH => Not even close.
PETER => More?
SETH => Yes.
PETER => A million?
SETH => Will Emerson made two and half million bucks last year.
PETER => Fuck you.
PETER => Fuck you!
SETH => He did.
PETER => How do you know that?
SETH => He told me.
PETER => He just told you that?
SETH => Well I asked him.
PETER => Do you think that's true.
SETH => Probably.
PETER => That's fucked up.
SETH => Why?
PETER => Does that seem right to you?
SETH => Right?
PETER => Jesus.
SETH => So what do you think that means Rogers puts away?
PETER => I have no idea.
PETER => This fucking traffic. We should have taken a the subway.
WILL EMERSON => Gentlemen?
SAM ROGERS => You're coming with us.
SETH => Will. Mr. Rogers.
WILL EMERSON => Sam this is Seth Bregman and this is Peter Sullivan.
SETH => Sir.
SAM ROGERS => Guys.
PETER => Will?
WILL EMERSON => Yes?
PETER => Where are we going?
SAM ROGERS => Going to get a second opinion on your work Peter.
ALL PRESENT => Slight hellos, etc.
JARED COHEN => So Sam, what do you have for us?
SAM ROGERS => Well... it should be here in a minute. Finding someone in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge.
JARED COHEN => Well why don't we start by introducing everyone then.
SAM ROGERS => OK.
JARED COHEN => This is Sarah Robertson who you know, our chief risk management officer, Ramesh Shah from upstairs, and David Horn one of the firm's in house counsel.
SAM ROGERS => Nice to meet you all. This is Will Emerson my head of trading, and this is...
WILL EMERSON => Peter Sullivan, and Seth Bregman. They work in our risk department.
JARED COHEN => Where is Eric Dale?
SAM ROGERS => He was let go today.
JARED COHEN => So who's left in your risk department?
WILL EMERSON => As of today that would be Peter and our junior analyst Seth...?
JARED COHEN => Really?
WILL EMERSON => Here. Please just give one to everyone, thanks.
SAM ROGERS => So apparently Eric had been working on this for some time but was unable to finish it, as he was leaving the building today he gave the program to Peter here, and told him to see what he thought. Peter figured a few things out that Eric seemed to be missing and this is what came out.
JARED COHEN => Where is Eric Dale now?
SAM ROGERS => He's been unreachable since he left the office.
SARAH ROBERTSON => Peter this is your work?
PETER => Mainly Mr. Dale's...
SARAH ROBERTSON => But this draft is yours?
PETER => Yes. Again, derived from Mr. Dale's original model. But yes.
SARAH ROBERTSON => And what is your background?
PETER => Background?
SARAH ROBERTSON => Your CV.
PETER => I have been with the firm for two years working with Eric that whole time... But I hold a doctorate in engineering, specialist in propulsion, from MIT, with a Bachelors from Penn.
JARED COHEN => What's a specialty in propulsion?
PETER => Well... in laymen terms my thesis was a study in the way that friction ratios effect steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads.
JARED COHEN => So you are a rocket scientist?
PETER => Um... I was... yes.
JARED COHEN => How did you end up here?
PETER => Well it's all just numbers really, you're just changing what you're adding up... and if I may speak freely the money is considerably more attractive here.
JARED COHEN => What time is it?
RAMESH => It's 2:15.
JARED COHEN => What do you have in exposure right now, tonight?
SAM ROGERS => I don't know... between 900 and 1.3... roughly.
RAMESH => If Mr. Sullivan's numbers are correct...
PETER => 1.215 Trillion.
RAMESH => Yes.
JARED COHEN => Fuck me... fuck me... And I'm guessing by the fact that you two haven't said anything that the math checks out?
SARAH ROBERTSON => Look    we'd need a little more time to go over    this, but Mr. Sullivan here seems to know    what he's doing. And I don't have to tell    you that this is a problem.
JARED COHEN => Thank you for that. What time is it?
RAMESH => 2:16.
JARED COHEN => Fuck me!
JARED COHEN => Sam how long under normal operations would it take your people to clear that from our books?
SAM ROGERS => What?
JARED COHEN => The 1.2 trillion.
SAM ROGERS => All of it?
JARED COHEN => Yes.
SAM ROGERS => I don't know, a couple weeks?
JARED COHEN => Weeks?
SAM ROGERS => Yes. But as you certainly know our business is selling AND buying. It doesn't work for very long without both components. If we suddenly stop buying for a day or two that just doesn't hide under the rug, it gets out and this whole this thing comes to a end... and right quick.
JARED COHEN => I understand.
SAM ROGERS => Do you?
JARED COHEN => How many traders do we have left between your floor and Petersen's?
SAM ROGERS => I don't know, sixty.
RAMESH => Jared I've just been looking here a little closer, and it's these VAR numbers that are really setting this thing off.
JARED COHEN => Excuse me, I need to make a quick call.
JARED COHEN => Please...
RAMESH => I was just saying, and just speaking completely off the record here, it won't be long before someone else starts putting these in and sees the exact same thing we are looking at here. If they haven't already.
JARED COHEN => Understood... And Sarah, what value would you allow to be placed on those assets that might be left on the books, if they had to be?
SARAH ROBERTSON => Why would they still be on the books?
SAM ROGERS => Because suddenly no one wants to buy them.
JARED COHEN => Oh fuck you Sam... give me a fucking break, all at once?
SARAH ROBERTSON => Without an active market, it could take weeks, months for me to value them correctly. You'd have to go block by block.
SAM ROGERS => It's a very simple business Jared. You and I talked about this last year...
JARED COHEN => Sam.... Will, Peter, and..??
SETH => Seth.
JARED COHEN => Seth, Could you please excuse us for a few minutes.
JARED COHEN => Oh and Peter? Who else has seen this?
PETER => No one... besides us here.
JARED COHEN => And Mr. Dale.
PETER => Yes.
JARED COHEN => And can it really be that we don't know where Eric Dale is?
WILL EMERSON => I'm afraid so. His wife tells us he hasn't come home yet...and the firm shut off his phone today.
JARED COHEN => Perfect. Well, I need to know where he is.
SETH => Jesus fucking Christ! Who is that guy?
WILL EMERSON => He's Sam's boss.
SETH => He looks like he's fifteen years old. How old is he?
WILL EMERSON => He's like forty.
PETER => How does that happen?
WILL EMERSON => Oh it happens all the time. Except to me. Kid's a fucking killer.
PETER => What are they talking about?
WILL EMERSON => It ain't pretty.
SETH => What ain't pretty?
WILL EMERSON => If people suddenly stop buying the shit we're selling....
WILL EMERSON => You guys smoke? Well, you should.
SAM ROGERS => Jared you can't do what you are thinking about doing.
JARED COHEN => What if we don't have a choice?
SAM ROGERS => What does that mean? Fuck you... you don't have a choice.
JARED COHEN => Fuck me? Have you looked at these numbers Sam??
SAM ROGERS => Yes, but what the hell do I know.
JARED COHEN => Well, Mr. Shah tell me if I'm wrong but to me these numbers don't add up.
RAMESH => If I may I'd like to take some time before we...
SARAH ROBERTSON => Jared we can't answer that yet.
JARED COHEN => Are you fucking kidding me... this is exactly what we've...
SARAH ROBERTSON => We need a little time before we can give you our conclusion.
JARED COHEN => OK. We meet in 45 minutes.
RAMESH => Sam, do you have this file?
SAM ROGERS => Yes, here it is.
JARED COHEN => And Sam we need Eric Dale, it's making me very uneasy knowing he is out there right now wanting to put a knife in our backs while he's not even aware he's holding the knife in his hand.
SAM ROGERS => What are you going to do?
JARED COHEN => Not sure.
SAM ROGERS => Are you going to call him?
JARED COHEN => I already did.
OMITTED => 35                                                                     35
SETH => Jesus.
PETER => Wow.
WILL EMERSON => Yeah.
SETH => Shit, that's a long way down.
WILL EMERSON => Yeah, it is.
SARAH ROBERTSON => Is this really where you want to be taking this at this point?
JARED COHEN => I'm sorry?
SARAH ROBERTSON => We don't even know if he's right.
JARED COHEN => How long should this take you to confirm?
SARAH ROBERTSON => Not long.
JARED COHEN => OK
PETER => Careful.
SETH => Jesus man.
WILL EMERSON => Did you know the fear most people feel when they stand on the edge like this is not actually a fear that they will fall but instead it's the subconscious fearing that they might jump? ....It's a fear of losing faith.
SETH => Well that's a little deep and depressing, thank you.
WILL EMERSON => Yeah well, I can get a little dark sometimes.
SETH => Will, come on. Get down.
WILL EMERSON => Not today!  So it looks like they are gonna have us dump this shit.
SETH => What?
WILL EMERSON => Yeah, you watch.
SETH => How?
PETER => A trillion bucks??
WILL EMERSON => I'm just saying.
PETER => How would they even do that?
WILL EMERSON => You can't... it's impossible. But they'll figure out a way. I've been at this place for ten years and I've seen some things that you wouldn't believe... and when all is said and done... they don't lose money. They don't care if everyone else does, but they won't.
SETH => Will?
WILL EMERSON => Yeah?
SETH => Did you really make two and half million bucks last year?
WILL EMERSON => Yeah... I did.
PETER => What do you do with all that money?
WILL EMERSON => I don't know really. It goes pretty quick. You learn to spend what's in your pocket.
SETH => Two and a half million goes quickly?
WILL EMERSON => Well the tax man takes half of it up front. So now you got what... million and a quarter. Mortgage grabs another 300K, I gave 150 to my parents to live off, so now you got what??
PETER => Eight hundred.
WILL EMERSON => I bought a car last year for 150. Probably another 100 eating... 25 on clothes, put 400 away for a rainy day...
SETH => Smart.
WILL EMERSON => And what's that?
PETER => 125 left.
WILL EMERSON => I spent 76,520 dollars on booze, dancers, and whores.
PETER => 76,520?
WILL EMERSON => Yeah, kinda shocked me, although I was able to write most of it off, as entertainment.
PETER                             SETH => Whoa!                               Whoa!
WILL EMERSON => What time is it?
SETH => 3:30!
WILL EMERSON => Oh, here they go. They are bringing in the cavalry! We better get down there.
SAM ROGERS => How old are you?
SAM ROGERS => Jesus...
JARED COHEN => This is a very... very bad dream.
SAM ROGERS => I don't know, seems like we actually may have just finally woken up.
SARAH ROBERTSON => Hello.
JARED COHEN => Come in.
SAM ROGERS => How do we look?
SAM ROGERS => I should go.
SARAH ROBERTSON => No, you should stay.
JARED COHEN => So?
SARAH ROBERTSON =>  It's all legit... the kid killed it. The formula is worthless.
JARED COHEN => What do you mean?
SARAH ROBERTSON => It's broken.
JARED COHEN => There are eight trillion dollars of paper around the world relying on that equation??
SARAH ROBERTSON => We were wrong.
JARED COHEN => You mean you were wrong.
SARAH ROBERTSON => Don't even start.... This was discussed.
SAM ROGERS => I'm heading to the conference room.
SARAH ROBERTSON => No.
JARED COHEN => I'd like you to hear this.
SAM ROGERS => No... I don't want to hear this.
SAM ROGERS => How do you think I've stuck around this place so long.
JARED COHEN => I've called Tuld.
SARAH ROBERTSON => Is there a contingency plan here?
JARED COHEN => A contingency plan?
SARAH ROBERTSON => Yes.
JARED COHEN => We went all in on this one.
SARAH ROBERTSON => So we've got ourselves quite exposed here... haven't we?
JARED COHEN => To Tuld or the market?
SARAH ROBERTSON => Both.
SARAH ROBERTSON => He's here.
WILL EMERSON => We were just grabbing a cigarette on the roof and a very spiffy looking helicopter dive-bombed us and then landed.
JARED COHEN => I know. Come with us. Where's Sam.
WILL EMERSON => I don't know. Do you want all of us>
JARED COHEN => Yes.
JARED COHEN => Just one piece of advice to everyone here before we go in there... this could get a bit ugly but whatever you do... just... tell the truth... don't try to change a word of it, no sugar coating... no one here is smart enough... including the rocket scientist.
44                                                                   44 => CONTINUOUS
ASSISTANT => Mr. Cohen?
JARED COHEN => Yes.
ASSISTANT => This way. They are already in there waiting for you.
JARED COHEN => OK.
JOHN TULD => Please sit down.
JOHN TULD => Welcome everyone. I must apologize for dragging you all here at such an uncommon hour but from what I've been told this matter needs to be handled urgently, so urgently in fact that it probably should have been addressed weeks ago...   45   CONTINUED:                                                       45 JOHN TULD but that is spilt milk under the bridge. So why doesn't someone please try to explain to me what's the problem here?
JARED COHEN => Well, Mr. Tuld as I mentioned earlier if you look here at the top page of this printout...
JOHN TULD => Jared, it's a little early for all that, how bout in English? ... Actually I'd like to hear from the guy who put this thing together... Mr. Sullivan is it? Does he speak English?
JARED COHEN => Sir?
JOHN TULD => I'd like to speak to the analyst who seems to have stumbled across this mess.
JARED COHEN => Well, that's Peter Sullivan here.
PETER => Sir.
JOHN TULD => Ah, there he is.
PETER => Yes sir.
JOHN TULD => How old are you Mr. Sullivan?
PETER => I'm twenty-seven sir.
JOHN TULD => Please call me John.
PETER => Yes sir.
JOHN TULD => So Mr. Sullivan why don't you tell me what you think is going on here, and please speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever, I didn't get here on my brains I can assure you of that.
PETER => Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an associate in the risk assessment and management office at MBS
JOHN TULD => Now you lost me at M...
PETER => Sorry...
JOHN TULD => I was joking Mr. Sullivan.
PETER => Yes... Well as you probably know over the last 36-40 months the firm has begun packaging new MBS products that combine several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security. This has been very profitable as I imagine you noticed.
JOHN TULD => I have.
PETER => Well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day. The problem, which is I guess why we are here tonight, is that it takes us... the firm... almost a month to layer these products correctly thereby posing a challenge from a risk management standpoint.
JOHN TULD => And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?
PETER => We have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to.
JOHN TULD => Yes.
PETER => But the key factor is these are essentially just mortgages, so that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably beyond what you might be willing, or allowed to do in any other circumstance, thereby pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags.
JOHN TULD => And how far have we pushed that profile tonight Mr. Sullivan?
PETER => We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion dollars... at MBS alone.
JOHN TULD => Give or take.
PETER => Give or take.
JOHN TULD => Now Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing, and give me a little rope here, what I am guessing that your report here says is that considering the, shall we say bumpy road, we've been on the last week or so that the numbers that your brilliant co- workers up the line ahead of you had come up with in the past don't seem to make much sense anymore considering what's taking place today?
PETER => Actually not taking place today but what's already taken place over the last two weeks.
JOHN TULD => So what you're saying is it's already happened?
PETER => Sort of.
JOHN TULD => And Mr. Sullivan what does your model say that means for us here?
PETER => Well, that's where it becomes a projection. But...
JOHN TULD => You're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan.
PETER => Well... sir... if those assets were to decrease by just 25 percent, and remain on our books... well... that loss would be greater than the current market capitalization of this company.
JOHN TULD => So what you're telling me Mr. Sullivan is that the music appears to be about to stop and we are going to be holding the biggest bag of stinking shit ever assembled in the history of capitalism?
JOHN TULD => Mr. Sullivan?
PETER => Well sir, I'm not sure I'd put it that way but let me clarify using your analogy, what this model shows is the music, so to speak, just slowing, if the music were to stop, as you put it, then this model would not be even close to that scenario. It would be considerably worse.
JOHN TULD => Well let me tell you something Mr. Sullivan. Do you want to know why I'm sitting here in this chair with you all, why I get the big bucks, so to speak?
PETER => Yes.
JOHN TULD => I'm here for one reason and one reason only.
JOHN TULD => I'm here to guess what the music is gonna do a week, month, a year from now. That's it, nothing more....... and I'm afraid... standing here tonight... that I don't hear... a... thing... just silence.
JOHN TULD => So, now that we know that the music has stopped, what can we do about it?
JOHN TULD => Mr. Cohen, Ms. Robertson, I'm afraid this is where you are supposed to step back in. Lord knows we relied enough on Mr. Sullivan today.
JOHN TULD => What have you got for us?
JOHN TULD => What have I told you since the first day you walked into my office?  That there are three ways to make a living in this business... Be first, be smarter, or cheat. Well I don't cheat, and even though I like to think we have got some pretty smart people in this building of the two remaining options, it sure is a hell of alot easier to just be first.
JARED COHEN => Sell it all today...
JOHN TULD => Is that even possible Sam?
SAM ROGERS => It is, but at what cost?
JOHN TULD => I'll pay.
SAM ROGERS => Really?
JOHN TULD => I think so.
SAM ROGERS => Almost a trillion bucks of paper?
JOHN TULD => Where does it come back to us?
SAM ROGERS => Everywhere.
JOHN TULD => Sam, I don't think you seem to understand what your boy down here just said... if I made you... how would you do it?
SAM ROGERS => You bring the traders in for their normal 6:30 meeting and you be honest with them, they're gonna know it's the end either way, so you'd have to throw them a bone, and a pretty big one. You'd have to come out of the gate storming... 40 percent done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your positions need to be gone by eleven, cause by lunch the word will be out. No swaps, no nothing, and by two o'clock you'll be getting 65 cents on the dollar, if you're lucky, and the feds will be in here looking up your ass and trying to slow us down.
JOHN TULD => Ramesh?
RAMESH => They'll slow you down but it's yours to sell. They can't stop you.
SAM ROGERS => John... let's just say we pull that off, which is saying something... the real question is... who are we selling this to?
JOHN TULD => The same people you've been selling this to for the last two years... and whoever else will buy it.
SAM ROGERS => If you do this you've killed that market for years. It's over.
JOHN TULD => 
SAM ROGERS => And you are selling something you know has no value.
JOHN TULD =>  We are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price, so that WE may survive, Sam.
SAM ROGERS => You'll never sell a thing to any one of them again.
JOHN TULD => I understand.
SAM ROGERS => Do you?
JOHN TULD => Do you!!! This is it, Sam, this is it!
JOHN TULD => It's 4:00... Jared you've got till 5:00 to break this down and draw me up a plan. 
PETER => Eric Dale.
JOHN TULD => Where is Eric Dale?
SARAH ROBERTSON => As of today he is no longer with the firm.
JARED COHEN => We have been trying to locate him.
JOHN TULD => So he is just out there with this information?
JARED COHEN => 
JOHN TULD => Carmelo?
LOUIS CARMELO => Yes.
JOHN TULD => Get me Eric Dale here by 6:30.
LOUIS CARMELO => Done.
JOHN TULD => OK, meet back here in an hour.
JOHN TULD => Sam... let's talk.
JOHN TULD => Hell of a town isn't it?
SAM ROGERS => Never really did it for me actually.
JOHN TULD => Really?
SAM ROGERS => Always been kinda a grass and tree guy.
JOHN TULD => I've always loved this place. Ever since I arrived. Everything about it.
SAM ROGERS => I can't say I feel that about anyplace actually.
JOHN TULD => Are you going to be able to come on board here Sam?
SAM ROGERS => I'm not sure John. This is really ugly.
JOHN TULD => You and I are salesmen Sam, we sell. That's what we do. It's not complicated.
SAM ROGERS => Exactly. And you damn well know that you don't make a sale unless you think the guy is gonna come back for more, and tomorrow we are done.
JOHN TULD => This is it Sam.
SAM ROGERS => You keep saying that, what is that supposed to mean?
JOHN TULD => It's the big one. Most of us aren't gonna make it out of this one.
SAM ROGERS => Us?
JOHN TULD => The street.
SAM ROGERS => What are you talking about?
JOHN TULD => This won't be the last `situation' I will be having this week. It's just the start.
SAM ROGERS => It's only the start because we are starting it.
JOHN TULD => Maybe. But I don't think that's true, not this time. The numbers just don't add up anymore.
SAM ROGERS => Well I agree with you there, I've been saying that for years.
JOHN TULD => I mean if this kid can come up with this...?
SAM ROGERS => I don't think I can go in knowing what I know and put the hammer down on these guys like this.
JOHN TULD => Oh please, when did you become so soft.
SAM ROGERS => Fuck you soft, you're panicking.
JOHN TULD => If you're the first one out the door Sam, it's not called panicking
SAM ROGERS => Look, I obviously don't have all the information that you do. But I think this could destroy this firm. 
JOHN TULD => You let me take care of that.
WILL EMERSON => How'd that go?
SAM ROGERS => This is a fucking shit show.
WILL EMERSON => They are going to do it?
SAM ROGERS => Probably.
WILL EMERSON => Jesus.
SAM ROGERS => Remember this day boys, remember this day.
ASSISTANT => Gentlemen, there is some breakfast down the hall if you guys are hungry.
WILL EMERSON => Seth, someone is going to have to get breakfast. And let's face it, it's you.
SARAH ROBERTSON => So what's the strategy here?
JARED COHEN => That's where I'm headed right now, downstairs to work on it with my guys.
SARAH ROBERTSON => No, you and I... with Tuld.
JARED COHEN => I'm not sure we need one, Sarah. That's not the way I've ever done this.
SARAH ROBERTSON =>  Please.
JARED COHEN => He knows where we both have stood on this all along. There's nothing more to do.
SARAH ROBERTSON => That's exactly my point, and knowing what was discussed by both you and I with him, I don't see how that can possibly you with anything but a false sense of comfort.
JARED COHEN => I'm not looking for a sense of comfort here, Sarah. I don't think there is one to be found.
SARAH ROBERTSON => So again, what's the strategy here?
JARED COHEN => On this particular front, I'm just not sure there's much left to do.
SARAH ROBERTSON => It's very simple. Don't even think of fucking me on this one, because if we are going down... you damn well know its going to be together.
JARED COHEN => No, I'm not sure I do know that.
SETH => What do you think Tuld made last year?
PETER => Would you shut the fuck up.
WILL EMERSON => 86 mil. in salary and bonus.
PETER => Really?
WILL EMERSON => Yeah, it's public record.
SETH => That's a lot of fucking money.
WILL EMERSON => He was worth a billion.
PETER => Was?
WILL EMERSON => Before today.
SETH => Really?
WILL EMERSON => You'll see.
PETER => ....I think I'm going to go get a coffee, does anyone need anything.
WILL EMERSON => 
PETER => I need a little real air.
SETH => Probably a good idea.
PETER => Will, is that alright?
WILL EMERSON => Alright?
PETER => If I get out of here for a minute?
WILL EMERSON => Yeah. Are you kidding? It's not a prison. Do you want me to hold your hand?
WILL EMERSON => Will Emerson...Yes...Oh thank you...I understand...OK.
SAM ROGERS => What?
WILL EMERSON => That was Eric's wife. He's alive, he's home. He doesn't want to talk to us. And he doesn't know she called me.
SAM ROGERS => Where's he live?
WILL EMERSON => The heights.
WILL EMERSON => Should we call Tuld's guy?
SAM ROGERS => No... it's Eric... the last thing we need is those guys going over there, you two go try to get him.
SAM ROGERS => But you've got to be back here by 6:00.
WILL EMERSON => OK.
JOHN TULD => May I come in?
SARAH ROBERTSON => Please, sit.
JOHN TULD => So... we are going to do this thing.
SARAH ROBERTSON => OK.
JOHN TULD => It's going to be tight.
SARAH ROBERTSON => Is Sam on board?
JOHN TULD => Not yet.
JOHN TULD => Sarah, I need a head to feed to these traders... and the board... this morning.
SARAH ROBERTSON => Is it me or Cohen?
JOHN TULD => It's you.
SARAH ROBERTSON => Of course you are well aware I filtered several warnings for you and Cohen over a year ago on this?
JOHN TULD => I'm not sure that's the best path for you to be taking at this point... you're going to be taken care of here...
SARAH ROBERTSON => 
JOHN TULD => Obviously it's quite complicated.
SARAH ROBERTSON => John I was told that in no uncertain terms...
JOHN TULD => It was all a very grey area.
SARAH ROBERTSON => It was actually made very clear at the time, by you and I and Cohen.
JOHN TULD => I'd really prefer that you didn't fight me on this...
JOHN TULD => We all fucked this one up pretty good...
SARAH ROBERTSON => Yes.
JOHN TULD => We need you to stay here till this is all done and the markets close.
SARAH ROBERTSON => I understand.
JOHN TULD => They'll go over the numbers with you downstairs... Good luck.
SETH => Ah fuck, it's Jared. He's coming this way.
WILL => What does wonderboy want?
JARED COHEN => Do you have a minute?
WILL => We're heading to get Eric Dale.
JARED COHEN => I know. I just need a second.
WILL => What is it?
JARED COHEN => Tuld and I have concerns that Sam may not be willing to step up and do the right thing here.
WILL => I don't think that's ever been a problem.
JARED COHEN => Of course it hasn't, but during acute situations, such as this, often what is right can take on multiple interpretations.
WILL => Sam will step up.
JARED COHEN => I know he will...but if he doesn't...
JARED COHEN => But if he doesn't, we need to know that you will.
WILL => That I will what?
JARED COHEN => Step up.
WILL => I have no doubt Sam will make the right choice. And if it makes you feel any better he and I have always had the same interpretation of what's right...no matter how acute the situation.
JOHN TULD => There he is.
SAM ROGERS => John.
SAM ROGERS => So what's it look like John?
JOHN TULD => Cohen has done a nice job. It can work.
SAM ROGERS => What does that mean?
JOHN TULD => It means, as you very well know, that you are a very important piece of this puzzle.
JOHN TULD => Here.
SAM ROGERS => That's very generous.
JOHN TULD => It's not a gift. I need to know you are with me on this.
SAM ROGERS => I'm with the firm John.
JOHN TULD => I won't get what I need out of your boys today unless they believe you... unless they believe in you completely.
JOHN TULD => Are you in?
SAM ROGERS => I told you I have my reservations.
JOHN TULD => Well you can't have any reservations.
JOHN TULD => And I need to know now.
SAM ROGERS => I'm with the firm completely John, as I always have been. Excuse me.
COFFEE GUY => One fifty.
PETER => Thank you.
LUCY => Hey...
PETER => Hi. It's really good to see you.
LUCY => You too. You look tired.
PETER => I am.
LUCY => What are you doing here?
PETER => I never left work. Just had to get out for a walk.
LUCY => You're still working there?
PETER => Yes, of course...
LUCY => Oh. I thought...
PETER => How are you? Are you happy? You look happy.
LUCY => I am.
PETER => Well, I should get back... How's your father?
LUCY => He's good. Thanks for asking.
PETER => OK. Be safe.
LUCY => Hey... You got any inside tips for him?
PETER => Sell.
SETH => Jesus, nice place.
WILL EMERSON => He just bought it.
SETH => I hope it was with cash.
WILL EMERSON => You are such a prick, and it wasn't.
SETH => I think I should stay here.
WILL EMERSON => Get out of the fucking car.
SETH => I just don't think it would be appropriate.
WILL EMERSON => Appropriate? Get the fuck out of the car.
SETH => Really?
WILL EMERSON => You're probably right... And don't touch any of the fucking buttons.
ERIC => What are you doing here?
WILL EMERSON => Peter finished that model you were working on.
ERIC => Really?
WILL EMERSON => It's created a bit of a shit storm.
ERIC => Yeah, I bet.
WILL EMERSON => Do you want to see it... the model?
ERIC => No.
WILL EMERSON => Really?
ERIC => No. But I'm pretty sure what it says.
WILL EMERSON => Do you think he's right?
ERIC => I'm sure he's right.
WILL EMERSON => Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting of the partners tonight. John Tuld has decided to liquidate our entire position.
WILL EMERSON => Today.
ERIC => Well, I am very sorry to hear that.
WILL EMERSON => They want me to get you back there, they are worried about you being out here.
ERIC =>  Please.
WILL EMERSON => I'm just saying.
ERIC =>  Not a chance.
WILL EMERSON => This is serious shit Eric.
ERIC => You don't think I know that. I've been warning that cunt Robertson about this shit since last March.
WILL EMERSON => Well...
ERIC => Fuck her... Fuck her.
WILL EMERSON => Look...
ERIC => I signed my papers man, I'm out. They've got nothing on me anymore.
WILL EMERSON => They'll pay...
ERIC => I've already been paid enough by them.
ERIC => Did you know I built a bridge once?
WILL EMERSON => I'm sorry?
ERIC => A bridge.
WILL EMERSON => No, I didn't.
ERIC => I was an engineer by trade.
WILL EMERSON => Well...
ERIC => It goes from Dilles Bottom, Ohio to Moundsville West Virginia. It spans 912 feet over the Ohio river. Steel through arch design. 12,100 people a day use the thing. 
ERIC => I completed that project in 1986... 22 years ago. Over the life of that one bridge that's 6 billion... 708 million... 240 thousand miles that haven't had to be driven! At let's say... 50 miles an hour that's 134,164,800 hours... or 559,020 days... so that one little bridge has saved the people of those two communities a combined 1531 years of their lives not wasted in the car... give or take.
WILL EMERSON => Jesus.
ERIC => One thousand, five hundred, thirty-one years...
WILL EMERSON => Fuck...
ERIC => That's what I did.  Look... you better get back over there.
WILL EMERSON => Yeah.
ERIC => Crazy shit.
WILL EMERSON => True. Dumping the whole fucking motherload in one day. Fucked up. Well... alright.
ERIC => Thanks for stopping by.
WILL EMERSON => No problem.
ERIC => Who the fuck is this?
WILL EMERSON => I'd guess it's the firm's people.
ERIC => What?
WILL EMERSON => Tuld doesn't want any loose ends.
ERIC => They fired me Will. Fuck em... Fuck em.
WILL EMERSON => Just come back with them, take the bonus, and you're home tonight by five. Either that or they are going to fight you on everything, the package, the options...
WILL EMERSON => You're a better man than I.
ERIC => Well that's always been true.
WILL EMERSON => Yes it has.
ERIC => See ya.
WILL EMERSON => The house looks great by the way.
ERIC => Thanks.
WILL EMERSON => And Eric...don't beat yourself up too bad over this shit.
ERIC => Yeah.
WILL EMERSON => Who the fuck knows.
WILL EMERSON => Some people like driving the long way home.
SETH => So, am I getting fired?
WILL EMERSON => I don't know.
WILL EMERSON => Probably...yes...almost definitely.
SETH => Are you?
WILL EMERSON => No.
SETH => Oh.
WILL EMERSON => It's not personal, you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time, the young guys are always the first to go. Nothing I say is gonna make you feel any better.
SETH => I get it.
SETH => When did you know this is what you wanted to do?
WILL EMERSON => The first time I made 36 million dollars for the firm in the last eleven minutes of the trading day.
SETH => Fuck me.
WILL EMERSON => It was a perfect trade...I saw it coming from three days away. I took my time. I was in, I was out...Pish posh...And it was beautiful.
SETH => How did you learn to do that?
WILL EMERSON => I'm not sure, and whatever it is it could be gone tomorrow.
WILL EMERSON => Look man I'm sorry about this.
SETH => Don't be, you're not doing it to me.
WILL EMERSON => I know...but I'm still sorry. At least you'll have some decent cash to walk away with.
SETH => Only if we can get this done, right?
WILL EMERSON => We'll get it done.
SETH => How?
WILL EMERSON => I'm trying to figure that out right now.
SETH => There aren't really enough willing buyers out there right now.
WILL EMERSON => I'm trying to think of every last one of them I can and then I'll make them willing.
SETH => Are you ok with that?
WILL EMERSON => I'm about to completely fuck guys I've been doing business with for fifteen years so no I'm not exactly ok with it. But look, every last one of them would do the same thing to me in a second...so it is what it is.
SETH => I guess. And what about everyone else?
WILL EMERSON => Everyone else?
SETH => Normal people.
WILL EMERSON => What are you a socialist? Fuck me Seth.
WILL EMERSON => Look, If you want to do this with your life, and do it well, you need to believe that you are necessary. And you are. If people want to live like this...with their big cars and these houses that they haven't even paid for. Then you are necessary. The only reason they can continue to live like kings is because we've got our fingers on the scale in THEIR favor. And if I were to take my finger off... 
WILL EMERSON => And tomorrow if this all goes south they'll crucify us for being reckless, but if we are wrong and everything get's back on track. They'll be laughing their arses off at us for being the biggest bunch of pussies that God ever let through the door.
SETH => Are we gonna be wrong on this one?
WILL => No...they're all gonna get fucked.
PETER => Hello.
SAM ROGERS => Peter.  You want one?
PETER => I don't smoke.
SAM ROGERS => That's good. I don't much either.
PETER => It's kinda beautiful out right now.
SAM ROGERS => Yeah, I guess it is...  I've never really liked this town much.
PETER => How long have you been here?
SAM ROGERS => Forty years.
PETER => I think it's beautiful. The whole place. Forty years, that's something... Are you tired?
SAM ROGERS => Of What?... Remember I don't work as hard as you do.
PETER => That's not true.
SAM ROGERS => No it is, actually.
PETER => Are we all getting fired after today?
SAM ROGERS => Probably.
PETER => They're going to fire you?
SAM ROGERS => That's not what they'll call it,... it'll be a mercy killing really.
SAM ROGERS => You don't have to stand out here for me.
PETER => I don't really want to go back in there just yet.
SAM ROGERS => I understand that.
PETER => I think I know your son.
SAM ROGERS => Really?
PETER => Yeah. Not well... but, he always seemed like a nice person.
SAM ROGERS => He is a nice person.
SAM ROGERS => I guess you could say alot worse about a guy.
PETER => Have you told him what's about to happen?
SAM ROGERS => What do you mean?
PETER => This whole thing.
SAM ROGERS => No... I hadn't even thought of it.
PETER => I guess it's illegal anyway?
SAM ROGERS => Yeah... who the fuck knows anymore.... and even if it was you'd sure as hell never get caught.
PETER => He's already pretty rich anyway though right? He doesn't need the help.
SAM ROGERS => That's very true.
PETER => He works with a friend of mine.
SAM ROGERS => He's a hell of alot richer than me, I know that much.
PETER => But you are taller.
SAM ROGERS => That's true. It's not much... but it's something... What did your father do?
PETER => He's a doctor.
SAM ROGERS => Really?
PETER => Eyes.
SAM ROGERS => Now that's something.
PETER => Yeah... it is.
SAM ROGERS => Did he want you to do that?
PETER => No, never.
SAM ROGERS => Oh.
PETER => He was always a pretty miserable guy actually...
PETER => They're all coming in now.
SAM ROGERS => Yes they are.
PETER => Have you ever done anything like this before?
SAM ROGERS => No... never.... not even close.
PETER => Oh...
SAM ROGERS => Yeah.
PETER => Do you really think this is the only... or the... right thing to do?
SAM ROGERS => For who?
PETER => I'm not sure.
SAM ROGERS => I'm not either.
PETER => So this is gonna make a pretty big mess of it, then?
SAM ROGERS => I don't even want to think about it.
PETER => Yeah.
SAM ROGERS => Just doesn't quite seem...
PETER => I know.
SAM ROGERS => 
PETER => Well. I guess we should get back.
SAM ROGERS => Yeah.
SAM ROGERS => Well good luck, you know, in the future... Seems like you'll probably be just fine.
PETER => Thank you.
JARED COHEN => You alright?
SETH => You just fired me.
JARED COHEN => I'm sorry...
SETH => This is all I've ever wanted to do.
JARED COHEN => Really?
SETH => Yes...
JARED COHEN => I am sorry.
SECURITY GUY => They are almost ready for you Ms. Robertson. Couple of minutes.
ERIC => You as well?
SARAH ROBERTSON => Yes.
ERIC => Jesus.
SARAH ROBERTSON => Yeah.
ERIC => I'm sorry.
SARAH ROBERTSON => Thank you... Sam and the rest of your floor are gone after today as well.
ERIC => Really... and Cohen?
SARAH ROBERTSON => No... still here.
ERIC => Of course...
ERIC => Are you still dating that tall guy... from the Christmas thing?
SARAH ROBERTSON => No.
ERIC => He was very tall.
SARAH ROBERTSON => 6'7''......
ERIC =>  Wow.
SARAH ROBERTSON => I did pass on your concerns last year... just so you know.
ERIC => It doesn't matter.
SARAH ROBERTSON => It does.
SARAH ROBERTSON => Thank you.
ERIC => Have they taken all the phones out of this room?
ERIC => Jesus. Paranoid fucks.
SARAH ROBERTSON => Yeah... I didn't think they were going to be able to get you back here.
ERIC => They told me they were going to drag me through hell on everything from my options to healthcare over the next two years or I come back and make... (he looks up and does a little math in his head) $176,471.00 an hour to sit in this room quietly... it wasn't much of choice.
SARAH ROBERTSON => It never is.
SARAH ROBERTSON => Obviously looking back, the point was expressed with insufficient urgency... 
ERIC => OK.
SARAH ROBERTSON => Eric.
ERIC => I understand, there was nothing you could do.
SARAH ROBERTSON => I guess... at the time... it didn't seem like there was much of a choice.
ERIC => It never does.
SARAH ROBERTSON => You have kids, yeah?
ERIC => What is your package going to look like?
SARAH ROBERTSON => I don't know, that's what I'm waiting for now.
ERIC => Should be pretty good, no?
SARAH ROBERTSON => It better be.
WILL EMERSON => Alright, hey....
SAM ROGERS => Thank you all for coming in a little early this morning, I know yesterday was pretty bad, I wish I could say that today is going to be less so but that isn't going to be the case. Now I am supposed to read this statement here to you all but how bout you read it on your own time and I'll just tell you what the fuck's going on here.
SAM ROGERS => I have spent the night here meeting with the executive committee and the decision has been made to begin to unwind a considerable portion of the firm's holdings in several key asset classes. The crux of it is... in the firm's thinking the party is over as of this morning. There is going to be considerable turmoil in the markets for the foreseeable future. They believe that it is better to have this turmoil begin with us... as a result the firm has decided to liquidate the majority of its position of fixed income MBS today.
SAM ROGERS => You should be getting a breakdown right now, you will see the accounts you are responsible for today. I'm sure it hasn't taken you long to understand the implications of this sale on your relationships with your counterparties and as a result on your careers. I have expressed this reality to the executive committee and they understand. As a result, if you are able to complete a 93% sale of your assets you will receive a 1.4 million dollar one off bonus. 
SAM ROGERS => For those of you who have never been through this before, this is what the beginning of a fire sale looks like. I don't have to tell any of you that the first hour and a half is going to be very important. I want you to hit every bite you can find. Dealers, clients, brokers, and your mother if she's buying...and obviously no swaps, its outgoing only today. This is obviously not the way any of us would like for this to be going down, but the ground is shifting below our feet, and there appears to be no other way out.
SAM ROGERS => Obviously... this is a very unique situation... if we are successful today we will have been successful in destroying our own jobs... I can not promise that each of you will be repositioned within the firm, but I can tell you that I am very proud of the work we have done together here, I have been at this here for 34 years, and I know... from experience people are going to say some nasty stuff about what we have done here, and what you have devoted a portion of your life to. But have faith that in the greater picture our skills have not been wasted, we have accomplished much, and our talents have served some greater good...
JOHN TULD => By the end of today almost everyone else in the world, including me, will have considerably less money than they began the day with..... You, in this room, are the exception. You will leave here today richer. You will fire the first shot, I wish it didn't have to be, but at times the market must eat its weak, and you all... are not the weak. We must strike quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause on the line, attack. By noon the SEC is going to be in here getting in your faces, sniffing around, you let us take care of them and you just keep going. We own what we are choosing to sell today and there is nothing they can do about it. 107 years ago this firm was founded, today we secure our place for next 107. You've got two minutes before we get started. Let's finish this, so we can get on to the next one...
JARED COHEN => Well done.
SAM ROGERS => They did alright.
JARED COHEN => I wanted to give you a heads up. They are going to start sending some people home out here.
SAM ROGERS => Now?
JARED COHEN => Sorry. No loose ends.
SAM ROGERS => Of course.
JARED COHEN => For what it's worth, you're good... Guess somebody upstairs must really like you.
JOHN TULD => Sam, please sit. Congratulations are clearly in order.
SAM ROGERS => Our guys did what they could.
JOHN TULD => You did a hell of a job today, and I thank you for it. Sit, excuse me for eating but it's been a long day. Can I get you anything?
SAM ROGERS => No, no thanks.
TULD => So what can I do for you?
SAM ROGERS => I want out.
TULD => I'm sorry?
SAM ROGERS => I'm done, I want out.
TULD => It's been a very difficult day, for everyone.
SAM ROGERS => I need you to release my options, that is if they're still worth anything after today, and I need the bonus. I'm out.
TULD => You'll get the bonus, the options, and keep your current base, but I need you to stay with me for another 24 months. O.K?
TULD => For God's sake man put a smile on your face, you did some good today, you said so yourself. I'm starting to feel a little better about this whole thing. You're one of the luckiest guys in the world, you could've been digging ditches all these years...
SAM ROGERS => That's true, and if I had been at least there'd be some holes in the ground to show for it. I'm just not quite sure how we fucked this thing up so badly.
TULD => Jesus, when did you start feeling so sorry for yourself, it's unbearable... What, you think we may have helped put some people out of business today? That it's all just for naught? Well you've been doing that everyday for almost forty years Sam. And if all this is for naught then so is everything else out there. It's just money, it's made up, a piece of paper with some pictures on it so we don't all kill each other trying to get something to eat. But it's not wrong and it's certainly not any different today than it's ever been. Ever. 1637, 1797, 1819, `37, `57,`84, 1901, `07, 1929, `37, `73, and 1987... God damn did that motherfucker fuck me up good, 92, 97, 2000, and whatever this is gonna be called. They're just the same thing over and over. We can't help ourselves, and you and I can't control it, stop it, slow it, or even ever so slightly alter it... We just react... and we get paid well for it if we're right... and get left by the side of the road if we're wrong. There's always been and there's always gonna be the same percentage of winners and losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat pigs and starving dogs in this world... yes there may be more of us today... but the percentages... they always stay exactly the same.
SAM ROGERS => I'll do it John, but not because of your little speech, but because I need the money. I'm not sure how it could possibly be after all these years, but I need the money.
SAM ROGERS => You're keeping the kid?
JOHN TULD => Keeping him? He's getting promoted. It's all hands on deck now Sam, there's going to be a lot of money to be made coming out of this mess, we're going to need all the brains we can get around here.
MARY ROGERS => Hello! ... I've called the police.
SAM ROGERS => Mary.
MARY ROGERS => Sam?
SAM ROGERS => Yup.
MARY ROGERS => What are you doing?
MARY ROGERS => What are you doing?
SAM ROGERS => Ella died.
MARY ROGERS => Oh God.
SAM ROGERS => Tumor on her liver. It was horrible.
MARY ROGERS => Well I'm very sorry.
SAM ROGERS => Yeah... I really loved that dog
MARY ROGERS => I know, but Sam you don't live here anymore.
SAM ROGERS => I was driving home from the vet and this is the only place I could think to bury her. This is where she belongs...
MARY ROGERS => Well. You should have called.
SAM ROGERS => I know.
MARY ROGERS => Are you alright? You look terrible.
SAM ROGERS => Yeah. Tough day all around.
MARY ROGERS => I heard, Sammy called.
SAM ROGERS => Is he alright?
MARY ROGERS => He said they got hammered, but got out alive.
SAM ROGERS => Good, I was going to call him this morning... but...
MARY ROGERS => Well, I am going to go back in to bed. The alarm is on so don't try to break in.  Well, you take care of yourself.
SAM ROGERS => Is it alright if I finish up here?
MARY ROGERS => Yes.
