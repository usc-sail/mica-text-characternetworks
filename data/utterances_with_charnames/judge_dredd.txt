NARRATOR => In the third millennium, the world... changed.
NARRATOR => Climate. Nations. Borders. All were in upheaval. Humanity itself turned as violent as the planet. Civilization threatened to collapse. And then... a solution was found. The crumbling, teetering legal system was merged with the overburdened police, creating a powerful and efficient hybrid. Trained equally in jurisprudence and combat, these new guardians of Society could dispense both justice and punishment. They were police, jury and executioner, all in one. They were... The Judges.

FIRST RESIDENT => Our Park! They stole our park!
SECOND RESIDENT => Lying bastards!
FIRST RESIDENT => Lying Judges! A ER::! gets tossed into the VIDEO SCREEN. As it SPARKS, the residents swarm, knocking it over - then the chain link fence around the lot starts to shake, heave and collapse -
ZED => Hey, Homies. The rezzies are going mental.

FERGIE => Still better than prison. BR.'.-TA':-TAT! Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts all around him. He looks
ASTONISHMENT AT => I'r SE ER.AL WINDOWS - HIS P . O . V . 20 As more and more frustrated residents OPEN FIRE at anything and everything.
ZED => Did you see that! What a fucking shot! What a fucking shot - ! Reggie h -fives him. Then an overhead THUD makes them look up a- the HEATING VENT. Zed reaches up - yanks off the grate -
ZED => What do we have here? You a Judge, little man? The others laugh at the concept.
FERGIE => Me, a Judge, no, no -
3RD SQUATTER => If you're a rezzie, then why are you hiding? This is a block war, man! They grab him, playing roughly with him.
ZED => You gonna stand up for your block, ain't ya?
FERGIE => Look, I'm out on parole - If I get into any trouble my ass is right back in Aspen - CLICK. Zed's gun is in his face. FERGIE  Let's go, Haven, Let's go Haven, Haven all the way - BANANA CLIPS are shoved into his hands along with boxes of :artridaes.
REGGIE => Reload, dipshit. BULLETS rip through the windows here. Fergie ducks, _er-_fied... drops the bullets.
HERSHEY => Take cover!
HERSHEY =>  This isn't a Sim, Rookie! Stand down and wait for back up!  In position outside Heavenly Haven. Pinned down by fire from upper floors.
HERSHEY => Fire is coming from Level Y, repeat Y. Request back-up, nearest Judge! The map BEEPS, shows a route. The hand moves to the THROTTLE.
UP ANGLE => The bike parts the flames like a curtain, SMASHES DOWN right in the middle of all the chaos. The Rider gets off.
BRISCO => That's our back-up? He's a sitting duck out there. You'd think he wants them to see him. Hershey smiles ruefully.
HERSHEY => If that's who I think it is... he does.
TWIST => Fuck. That's Judge Dredd. We gotta surrender while we can-- He starts to raise his gun over his head. Zed smacks him in the yaw with his own weapon.
ZED => You chickenshit bowab! He's gonna surrender to us. And then we'll blow his brains out. . Come and get us, Dredd! Zed FIRES out the window. Reggie happily joins, then the others. Finally Twist shrugs, FIRES too.
REGGIE' => More ammo! A terrified Fergie hands him a clip.
HERSHEY => Down! You crazy futz - !
DREDD => He's firing a 64 laze pumper from six hundred feet. He couldn't hit me if I painted a bull's eye on my ass.
DREDD => You - last. Dredd pushes Brisco behind Hershey. Turns toward Heavenly as re draws his massive LAWGIVER HANDGUN. Dredd speaks into the ::ny computer in the breech as he aims at the door.
DREDD => Grenade. :'BccM! The round knocks the steel door off its hinges. Dredd r:zxs :z aside and the Judges enter.
FOOD ROBOT => Delicious and healthful ration packs, piping hot and ready to eat..!
DREDD => No. There.

BRISCO => This room is under-- BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA! Brisco is blown backwards off his feet.
DREDD => You're all under arrest. Will you surrender, or would you like your trials now? 7ne', look at him for a moment - then BLAST away.

DREDD => Mega-City Municipal Code 334.8. Willful destruction of property. That's two years. WHAR:. He hits Zed in the face. Zed rocks, but stays up. He fries tc grab a nearby weapon, but Dredd kicks it away.

DREDD => Code 7034-A. Resisting arrest. Twenty years. Dredd breaks free! Slams Zed once, twice. Zed flies back against the wall.
DREDD => 9804. Assault on a Judge with deadly intent.
ZED =>  Don't tell me. Life. CAMERA REVEALS that Zed another weapon hidden behind his back. Now, he goes for it!
DREDD => No... Death. He FIRES at the same moment as Zed! Zed's shot hits Dredd's ARMOR, pings off. Dredd's shot hits Zed's heart.
DREDD => Court is adjourned.
HERSHEY => I was supposed to watch out for him.
DREDD => He made the mistake. Not you. Dredd cocks his head, listening. Somehow in the din and confusion he has heard something. He turns.
FOOD ROBOT => Ummm, umm, yumm! Healthful and nutritious food rations, ready to eat! Dredd suddenly pushes forward in the crowd. Hershey follows. She watches, puzzled, as he steps in the automaton's path, takes an assault rifle from another Judge and AIMS it!
DREDD =>  The guide wire in the floor isn't working.  Five! Four!
FOOD ROBOT => Ah, just put your credit in your selection and - credit in the slot and-and - shit! The robot stops. The jumble of food in back spills out and Fergie uncoils from the cramped interior, still holding the scarK r.a wires he was using to manipulate the machine.
DREDD => Mega-City Municipal Code 1286.4: Willful sabotage of a public servo-droid. That's six months, citizen. He grabs Fergie, pushes him against the wall.
DREDD => - Let's see your Unicard.
FERGIE => Come on, give me a break, Judge uh-.
DREDD => FERGUSON, Herman. Forget six months: You've hacked into city droids, computers...  Cash machines, robot taxis... And you haven't even been out of jail for twenty four hours.
FERGIE => Five years? But - I - I had no choice, judge - He sees Dredd's impassive face, turns to Hershey's more sympathetic one.
FERGIE => They were killing each other up there, I had to get out! I only hacked the droid to save my life! It was the only way!
DREDD => Not at all. You could have climbed out a window, worked your way down. Or found a turboshaft and shimmied down the cable.
FERGIE => Sixty stories? It woulda been suicide!
DREDD => Maybe. But it would have been legal. I sentence you to five years in. Aspen Penitentiary. Case closed. Take him away. s-': protesting, Fergie is hauled away. Hershey looks at Dredd.
HERSHEY => He might have been telling the truth. Haven't you ever heard of extenuating circumstances?
DREDD ' => Yes. And cowardice isn't one of them.

ESPOSITO => - Griffin has been trying to get us to swallow his crime package for two years now and I still have
INDIGESTION - => UPROAR. We sense that the room is evenly divided. A GAVEL BANGS for order with a CRACK like thunder. Everyone quiets as quickly as schoolchildren..
FARGO => Order, order! As presiding Justice, I only vote to break a tie. But I wish to address the question of Judge Griffin's crime package. Is there any objection?
GRIFFIN => This entire body owes its very existence to you, Chief Justice.  I can ' t imagine anyone having an objection. CAMERA sweeps towards Fargo, passing over the MAP of North America etched on t h e great DAIS. Only a few lights stand out on all the conti nent: MEGA-CITY ONE; MEGA-CITY TWO; TEXAS CITY; and the ASPEN PENAL C OLONY. All the rest is labeled THE CURSED
EARTH. => Fargo stands, eyes blazing with intelligence and intensity. we sense t h at we are observing a Lion in Winter. And the lion can still roar.
FARGO => This body is not the first assembly (' to think that more laws and fewer choices will bring peace and order. That delusion has been tried and failed before. If the citizens of Mega-City are demanding more control of their lives, that's not a threat - it's a signal! A signal to open the windows of our society and let it: breathe -  Not to bolt the door and throw away the key! My fellow Judges, I was barely in my teens when I put on this badge. When the time comes for me to take it off... let me do it. knowing that it stood for Freedom... and not for Repression. He sits down. Clearly he has changed the mood of the room.
JUDGE GRIFFIN => Once again, Chief Justice,'you have served as a moral compass for all of us. I... withdraw my proposal.
HAMMOND => --fifty three people hospitalized.
HAMMOND => Some people say that to be a Judge on these mean streets is bound to have a certain dehumanizing effect, and that we should sympathize with the Judges. I agree. But the Mega- City Council apparently doesn't. To them, "dehumanization" isn't just a buzz word - it's a byword. And I'll show just how terrifyingly far they've taken that thought... tomorrow night.
DREDD =>  A rookie Judge died there, too. I guess he wasn't worth mentioning.
DDD => Things will get better, sir.
DREDD => Chief Justice?
FARGO => Four Summary Executions, Dredd. Were they necessary?
DREDD => They were unavoidable, sir. Out there... that's the reality.
W => e make our own reality, Dredd. Maybe it ' s time for a new one. Although I doubt Judge Griffin would recognize a new reality if he arrested it himself.
DREDD => With all due respect, sir, how can you say that when you spend most of your time - D edd breaks off; he's said too much. But Fargo won't let him she hook.
FARGO => Most of my time where?
DREDD => At the Academy... Sir.
FARGO => Don't you mean at the Academy wiping Cadet's Asses? That is what they say in the squad room, isn't it?
DREDD => It.. doesn't matter what they say, Sir. You're the.Chief Justice of Mega City. If rt weren't for you and the others like you, we wouldn't have our justice system. There isn't a Judge in Mega-City who doesn't want to follow in your footsteps.
FARGO => I'm glad you feel that way, Dredd. Because starting tomorrow you're going to spend one day a week at the Academy... teaching. Dredd takes this in his stride.
DR,EDD => I'd be honored. Unarmed combat, or marksmanship?
FARGO =>  Ethics. And as Dredd reacts, we

RICO => Have you come for another... chat?
MILLER => A short one, I'm afraid. Duty calls.
MILLER => When you killed innocent people you went far beyond-'service. Rico stands. Moves toward the energy curtain. Glares at Miller.
RICO => "Innocent"? A meaningless word. The innocent exist only until they inevitably become perpetrators themselves. In the end, "Guilt" and "Innocence" are merely a matter of timing.
MILLER => 'You're insane.
RICO => Am I? When did you become a perpetrator? Was it the time you found money mysteriously transferred into your account? Or the time I was sentenced to death? You've been taking bribes for years, Warden. You're a criminal. And a stupid one: You don't even know who's paying you.
MILLER => I don't want to know.
RICO => If ignorance is bliss, Warden, then you must be very blissful.
MILLER => Your mysterious benefactor has sent you a package. M:.. .er speaks into a console before Rico's laser-guarded "cell.
MILLER => Deactivate Shield. ENERGY CURTAIN drops. The autoguns on the wall swivel toward Rico. Miller moves onto the platform, hands over the package. Rico places his thumb on the lock and it OPENS.

DREDD => Kevlar nine helmet and body armor. WIDEN. Dredd is LECTURING to a group of CADETS who hang on his every word. We're in a TRAINING AREA like the one "Q" ran in the Bond movies. Dredd turns. A TECH nods: Target ready. Dredd FIRES a barrage of bullets at a mannequin in Judge's gear. The bullets ricochet off. The class OOOHS and AHHS.
DREDD => Yours, when you graduate.
DREDD =>  Lawgiver Two. Twenty five round sidearm with mission-variable voice programmed ammunition.
DREDD => Yours, when you graduate.
DREDD => Mark IV Lawmaster, improved model. With on-board cannon, vertical take off and landing,. flight capacity and 500 kilometer range. The head Tech gives thumbs up while the other techs step back. The class waits, expectant. The lead tech throws a REMOTE. SPARKS fly. The motor COUGHS, dies. The class GROANS. Dredd glares at the embarrassed technicians.
DREDD => Yours... if they ever get it to work. LAUGHTER. Dredd moves to a lectern. Faces the class.
DREDD => All of these things are nothing but toys. Bottom line, final word, end of the day, when you're alone in the dark... all that counts... is this. takes something from the lectern shelf, throws it down. It's all-but holy book: THE LAW.
DREDD => And you will be alone. Because when you swear to uphold these ideals, you are sacrificing whatever chance you have for a Life. h T e': Frown; this is not what they expected to hear from a legend. They become increasingly unnerved.
DREDD => For most of us t'here is only lonely death on the streets... or, for those few of us who survive to old age... the prouder loneliness of the Long Walk.
DREDD =>  Life, Liberty, and the Pursuitof Happiness. Old and noble ideas. But they are what we give to (Xi others... not what we will ever receive for ourselves. Class dismissed. The class breaks up on a definite low note.
OLMEYER => Judge Hershey, the yearbook deadline is only a week away. Have you changed your mind?
HERSHEY => Forget it, Olmeyer. I'm not gonna be the yearbook Centerfold!
OLMEYER => It's not a centerfold, it's a calendar! And it won't be a tacky 3-D hologram. The yearbook is all classic print and 2-D. Here, let me show you a dummy - He s:ar::s to open the book. She slams it closed on his fingers.
HERSHEY => No, let me show yoou a dummy. She turns his head so he can SEE his reflection. When he turns back - she's gone.
HERSHEY => Judge Dredd? He looks at her, waiting.
(X; => I caught your lecture today. Do... do you really think that's what the cadets need to hear?
HERSHEY => Well, I think your truth is relative. I have a personal life. I have lots-of friends.
DREDD => Really. How long since you saw any of them?
DREDD => You've only been on the street a year. You're still in denial.
HERSHEY => It's not that bad.
DREDD => How many married Judges do you know?
HERSHEY => Uh, well, my class is young. None of them have found the right... person. e lust looks at her.
HERSHEY => Has it really been like that for you? Haven't you ever been in -
DREDD => Yes. Once.
HERSHEY => What happened?
,GEIGER => We've closed for the night.
RICO => You're holding a package for me. I'm. Rick.
GEIGER => Oh, yeah... Gimme a second.
RICO => I thought they destroyed all the ABC Warbots?
GEIGER => Whoa, friend, whoever sent you this is no friend at all.
RI CO => Oh? And why's that?
GEIGER => That's a Lawgiver. It's programmed to only recognize a Judge's hand. You want a weapon, I can get you something nice. But if you touch that it'll take your arm off.
RICO => Really? grabs it! Geiger flinches - then looks puzzled.
RICO => How do you like that? He SHOOTS Geiger at point-blank range. Geiger hits the floor.
RICO => I must be a Judge. Rico bends, takes Geiger's keys and his cigars... then goes to the big cage.
robot's body. => Inside, the circuit cards have all been pulled from their sockets. Rico begins whistling... reveille. He pushes the boards back in, hits the RESET button.
ROBOT => Status. Commander. Mission. Rico strikes a match on the robot, lights a cigar.
RICO => Status: Personal bodyguard. Commander: Rico. Mission: We're going to war.
LILY => Vardis, if you're right, then this Judge Dredd isn't really part of the conspiracy.
HAMMOND => No, of course n9t. It began before he was born. It had to have.
LILY => Then your report tomorrow _will destroy an innocent man. Doesn't Dredd's future bother you?
HAMMOND => Yes. But I'm more worried about all of our futures then about Judge... The door THUDS open. Startled, they turn -
HAMMOND =>  .Dredd... ELAM BLAM BLAM! The Judge's gun FIRES and we

DREDD => Is this your car?
CAR OWNER => Hey, come on... what are you gonna do, tow me?
DREDD => Of course not. Towing is the penalty for the first offense. This is your second violation.  Grenade.
92 WIDER => Dredd aims, FIRES. The caz. EXPLODES! Dredd walks casually away while the car's owner stands slack-jawed with debris tinkling around him.
FARGO => Dredd. I... I can't believe it...
GRIFFIN => I'm afraid the evidence is conclusive. The trial will be just a formality. Fa:=c descends shakily from his seat. Moves to the window. :e =axes a pill from his pocket, tries to swallow it without ;_ _ f _ _r. seeing
FARGO => Is it possible? Dredd, homicidal too? We went through.this nine years ago...
GRIFFIN => We were able tohide the facts then. This time, we may not be so lucky.
GRIFFIN => The victim was a reporter. The media is already sniffing around. Eventually... they'll get to the truth.
GRIFFIN => About Janus... and your part in it.
FARGO => How... how long have you known?
GRIFFIN => Does it matter?
GRIFFIN => There's a way out, Chief Justice.
FARGO => Into oblivion? You're suggesting I take it? You-fiust really want to destroy me -
GRIFFIN => No. I want to save the Judge system. The media won't stop digging into Dredd's case. When they get to the bottom... they'll find you.
GRIFFIN => But if you take the Long Walk... they'll find nothing but your honored memory.
FARGO => My Walk will give you the Chief Judgeship!
GRIFFIN => It could also save Dredd's life.
JUDGE HUNTER => In here. The Judge Hunters open a HOLDING CELL. Hershey steps inside.
HERSHEY => Dredd? What's going on? And who are those feebs? I've never seen
DREDD => They're Judge Hunters, Hershey. They're the ones who come out when a Judge has broken the Law. Hershey reacts; she's heard of them.
HERSHEY => Judge Hunters? Then it's a full trial before the Council... that only happens one in a generation...
DREDD => Judge Hershey. I don't have anyone else to ask... Will... will you be my defense attorney?
HERSHEY => You're under.indictment? For what?
DREDD => Murder. (X
JUDGE MCGRUDER => Stop Video.
MCGRUDER => Before we go on, I wish to make a personal comment.
DREDD => That is the Law, Judge McGruder. I would expect no less.
GRIFFIN => The Court shares in Judge McGruder's sentiments. In a way I am glad that Judge Fargo is about to begin his Long Walk.
GRIFFIN => He will be spared the pain of this trial. Proceed, Judge McGruder.
MCGRUDER => The video you have just seen is prima fascia evidence that the defendant is guilty as charged. Mark this video People's Exhibit
CLERK => So marked. At the defendant's station, Hershey stands.
HERSHEY => Objection, Your Honor. This video is inadmissible as evidence.
MCGRUDER => Judge Hershey, are you serious? Both of them recognized Judge Dredd!
HERSHEY => That is the State's interpretation. Replay dialogue. _EC rewinds. Then:
LILY => .Doesn't Dredd's future-bother you?
HAMMOND => Yes. But I'm more worried about all of our futures then about Judge ...Dredd...?
HERSHEY => Stop video. Do you hear it? When Lily Hammond says "Dredd", it's part of the conversation. And when Vardis Hammond,,sa s 'Dredd' it could just as easily be the same. The suggestion that either has recognized their murderer is sheer supposition... or, in the case of the prosecution, wishful-thinking! BIG REACTION from the packed room. Griffin bangs the gavel for silence.
37 - => THE DEFENSE TABLE 1r Hershey returns here to get another document. Dredd WHISPERS.
DREDD => Judge Hershey. I'm really glad I picked you to defend me.
HERSHEY => You only picked me because you didn't have anyone else.
DREDD => I'm still glad. CAMERA FOLLOWS Hershey forward.
HERSHEY => It clearly shows nothing!
HERSHEY => Cadet Olmeyer is acknowledged by all his instructors to be an expert in the field of still and video graphics. His affidavit states that this surveillance video is of such low definition that even after all known enhancements are used, no positive identification can be made of the killer. Since the uniform of a Judge could be counterfeit, I repeat my objection to this video being entered as evidence in this case.  I ask for a ruling.
GRIFFIN => Objection... sustained. The video is inadmissib e.
OLMEYER => Yessss! The rest of the courtroom goes nuts. Griffin bangs for order. The BAILIFFS call out.
BAILIFFS => Order, order!
DREDD => That kid barely knows me and he wants to save my ass.
HERSHEY => Trust me. It's not your ass he's interested in.
MCGRUDER => Your Honor. I am forced now to enter certain technical evidence of a critical nature regarding the Mega-City Legal system.I will need the Court's permission. I will also need permission to access the Central Computer Bank.
MCGRUDER => Central. I wish to access weapons schematics, Judges division. Describe the workings of the standard Judge's sidearm, the Lawgiver Two, and especially its improvements over the earlier Lawgiver One. Central SPEAKS. Somehow its monotonous, sexless voice hints at an actual personality.
CENTRAL => One moment.
'8 108 => ,_u OMITTED thru
CENTRAL => Nine years ago, the Lawgiver Model Two replaced the Lawgiver Model One. The difference lies in two areas: The computer chip and the ammunition coding. Like the Model one, the computer chip recognizes the thumbcode of all Judges. Judges may use each other's firearms; but a suspect dare not use a Judge's .weapon against "a Judge. ANIMATION reminds us of this in non-gory fashion.
CENTRAL => However, the ammunition coding in the Model Two is not cued to the thumbcode recognition chip. Instead, it is coded to the personal DNA of the Judge using the weapon.
I-I => Listening carefully, wondering where this is going.
CENTRALS VOICE => This is obtained in a download from my medical files and upgraded automatically every time the weapon is reloaded. Each time a round is chambered and fired, it is tagged with the relevant DNA.
MCGRUDER => Central. Were the bullets recovered from the bodies of Vardis and Lily Hammond so DNA coded?
CENTRAL => Yes, Judge McGruder. It could not be otherwise.
MCGRUDER => And what was the result of the computer check of the DNA coding on those bullets? :ould swear that the computer is going for drama.
CENTRAL => The DNA is a perfect match for Judge Joseph--D-re--dd. _:iAMSER - WIDE SHOT
HERSHEY =>  DNA evidence is irrefutable!
DREDD => Do your job. She nods, stands.
HERSHEY => Your Honor... the defense rests.
5 WIDER => Griffin looks at McGruder.
MCGRUDER => Your Honor, the Prosecution rests.
GRIFFIN => The Jury may be sequestered. The Foreman, COUNCIL JUDGE ESPOSITO, stands.
ESPOSITO => Your Honor, sequestering is not necessary. The evidence is irrefutable.
GRIFFIN => Joseph Dredd, for this crime the Law allows only one punishment:
DEATH. => S:OCR: rebounds from every wall. As the gasps fade away, Griffin taxes out a sealed document.
GRIFFIN => However: I have here the last order of Judge Fargo, written this morning before he prepared for the Long Walk.
(OPENING ITCH => He orders that this Court be lenient with Judge Dredd, in gratitude for his years of service.  It has always been our-custom to carry out the last order of a Walking Judge. We will so honor this one.
GRIFFIN => "Let the Betrayer of the Law be taken from our Courts;" Already the Judge Hunters are coming for him.
HERSHEY => Dredd. I... I'm sorry.
DREDD => You did your best, Judge Hershey. He stands, takes her hand.
DREDD => Thank you.
GRIFFIN => "Let the Freedom he stole from others be stolen from himself;"
H T => pan. e Judge Hunters pull at him. Hershey hangs on as long as she

bundle. => A young FEMALE CADET in an sweet Contralo that contrasts with Griffin's bass READS from a different part of The Law:
FEMALE CADET => "Let him be written in our hearts and our memories." She hands him the Book. Receives his bundle of worldly h=_ongings in return. A young MALE CADET steps forward, hands Fargo an ancient REMINGTON.
2Z 125 => _= shoved into a jammed PRISON SHUTTLE. GUARDS fling.him in s=a=. The shuttle door closes, locks.
GRIFFIN => "Let him be stricken from our hearts and our memories."
FEMALE CADET => "Forever." A line of CADETS raises Lawgivers overhead. They FIRE a 21 GUN SALUTE. Fargo walks out. TYye gate CLOSES.
GRIFFIN => "Forever."
GRIFFIN => Are you out of your mind, coming here? Griffin angrily starts forward... stops when the ABC robot moves to block his path.
GRIFFIN => And you brought this, too? Griffin waves his hand over desk controls. The lights DIM. S:i TTERS block the windows.
RICO => I like to do things my way.
GRIFFIN => Yes, I know. Like framing Dredd for Hammond's murder.
GRIFFIN => Hammond had to be silenced when he found out abut Janus! But I could have used Dredd! He practically worshiped the ground I walked on-
RICO => Dredd only worships the Law. And he'd blow you away the minute he found out just how much you're pissing on it. Trust me: It's better this way. Let him see what it's like to freeze his ass off in Aspen. Let him see what it's like I to be me! After all... He moves closer to Griffin, smiles.
RICO => .Dredd and I have so much in common. Why not this? Griffin looks at him, decides to drop the subject.
GRIFFIN => There's a lot of work to be done.
RICO => Yes. The Janus lab -
GRIFFIN => You'll see it soon enough. In the meantime... I want chaos, Rico. That block war was just the beginning. Now I want fear racing through every street... terror in every quad... panic in every block. Until those miserable rezzies think even their Judges can't save them. That's when the Council will turn to me... and to Janus. Rico moves towards the door. Pauses.
RICO => Fear, Terror, Panic. I think I can handle that. After all...  Look how quickly I brought fear in here. His smile fades and he exits.
110-1 => A HOWLING WIND blows dust across the dead landscape. The ASPEN PRISON SHUTTLE appears over the horizon.
PILOT => Attention, crew. We're changing course to avoid some chop. ETA Aspen Prison 11 hundred twenty two. The craft BANKS, the prisoners chains clanking as they sway. A mean looking PRISONER behind Dredd leans over, hisses:
DREDD => Okay. W::.h a SNAP and without looking, Dredd jerks his elbow ba_xwards. The prisoner is knocked unconscious. As he sags in .is :hains, CAMERA ADJUSTS. The prisoner on the side of Dredd we haven't seen is Fergie. Now, he stares at Dredd. Then pins his hands over Dredd's.face, leaving Dre 's jaw =xcs and parting his fingers at Dredd's eyes, like the visor in she Judge's helmet. Fergie's eyes go wide.
FERGIE => Dredd? What are you doing here?

FERGIE => That makes two f us.
DREDD => No. You got the sentence the Law required. The Proper sentence.
FERGIE => Proper? Five years just for saving my own ass? .It was a mistake!
DREDD => The Law does not make mistakes.
FERGIE => Yeah? Then how do you explain what happened to you?
VOICE => You're wasting your breath, brother man...
REVEREND ANGEL => Dredd's a machine. See, any man - even a Lawman - has a heart. But not Dredd. He's frozen inside. That's how he could make this man  and these boys - watch while like the Grim Reaper himself, he coldly cut down the youngest fruit of our tree.
ANGEL SONS => Amen.
DREDD => Angel: Maybe if your youngest fruit hadn't taken those hostages he could be here for the family reunion. As one, all the Angels lunge forward as much as their short chains will allow. Fergie recoils; Dredd doesn't. But two GUARDS turn at the commotion. (X'

She moves to the bookcase: A small collection of leather-bound books, maybe a dozen in all. Plato, More, Jefferson, Paine. Hershey runs her fingers over the well-worn titles.
COMPUTER VOICE => If Alarm is not reset, .system will signal armed response in 20 seconds. Hershey opens a drawer. A.few clothes. She slips her hands underneath, feels around, finds nothing. Opens the next drawer.

DREDD => What the hell's wrong?
FERGIE => The stabilizers controls! They got hit, toot CAMERA RAKES to the control panel... and a SMOKING, SIZZLING section. The craft tilts alarmingly. Dredd grabs the stick, helps Fergie try and pull up. It's useless.

ILSA => Pathetic. She turns to leave... stops when she sees the amused eyes of the man watching her from four feet away: Rico.
RICO => Hello, Professor.
RICO =>  I see you're still researching the dark night of the soul.
ILSA => The research ended when they condemned you. I live here, now. You showed me that facing death was the only way to live. Her eyes glisten as she moves towards Rico, touches his arm.
ILSA => They... they told me you were dead. ?_cc reaches out gently. . .wipes a tear from her cheek.
RICO => Don't go woosy on me, Professor. We got work to do. He puts his arm around her. They step over her victim on their way out.
158A => Helmeted JUDGE HUNTERS move through the dim wreck, using BAR CODE READERS to scan the .ID tags of the dead. SCANNERS attached to their weapons show readings.

SECOND HUNTER => Sir.We found tracks leading away fromthe wreck. At least half a dozenpeople.
SQUAD LEADER => Yessir. Quite Clear.

HERSHEY => Central, I need to access the graphics database.
CENTRAL => That could take several days, Judge Hershey. The Graphic Database covers all known graphics, from the Paleoithic Era to today. Hershey opens the framed viewies she took from Dredd's apartment, slides out the one with the adult Dredd.
HERSHEY => This should be a little faster:  I want you to ID this man.

GRIFFIN => You've made a lot of progress. Good.
ILSA => Lights! About time - eyes narrow as Ilsa comes in from another area with a oboard.
ILSA => Since then I've learned innocence is just another lie. And that the best truths come only with pain.  And... speaking of painful truths... Here's our shopping list. She hands Griffin the digital notepad.
RICO => Tomorrow. But it won't mean a thing if you can't get into Central's Janus files. They're still security locked.
GRIFFIN => Leave that to me. Meanwhile you have work to do... on the streets.
RICO => "Fear, Terror, Panic." Yes. My favorite emotions.

DREDD => You have just committed murder. The penalty isdeath. Reverend Angel HITS Dredd.
REVEREND ANGEL => Silence, blasphemer! You still put your faith in a false Law, instead of the one True Law!
REVEREND ANGEL => Can it be? Can it be, that from the City of the Fallen, there is one of the Faithful?
FERGIE => Amen, brother! Say it!

OLMEYER => If this is the wrong picture, why is it full of anomalies?

FARGO => Judge or citizen - everyone got a fair shake. She treated them all the same.
DREDD => No. You and the first Judges... you saved Mega-City.
FARGO => Yes. And almost lost our souls.  It seemed like,,a wise idea: Create the perfect Judge. Breed courage - wisdom - integrity. The Janus Project. We used the old Council for the base material. Five DNA samples were taken, two were chosen. One was mine.

DREDD => What do you mean, both times?
DREDD => I have a... brother?
FARGO => More than a brother.

FERGIE => And these Cursed Earthers, they made it through? , _
DREDD => Actually, they were burned to a crisp. But the theory's sound.

HERSHEY => You can start by telling me why Dredd's baby picture is a state secret. Pause. We can almost hear Central thinking. Meanwhile, behind Hershey, a figure in a Judge's uniform approaches her Bike... drops something into a storage compartment on it. Even from this distance we notice a red arming light on the object.

DREDD =>  Myself. Griffin. Fargo. Even Fergie. I've been wrong about so much...
HERSHEY => Never the Law, Dredd. Never the Law. That means more than anything else she can say to him. He looks into her eyes. Fergie comes in, ends the moment.
FERGIE => You can forget the terminal out here. We're gonna have to go somewhere else to get in the System.
DREDD =>  Hershey. You just said I was never wrong about the Law. They took away my badge. I'm a convicted murderer. I have no authority any more - no legal authority. Pause. without the law as a safety net, Dredd is in uncharted emotional territory.
DREDD => Will ...wi11 you help me, Hershey? Not as a Judge but... but... as my friend? ::'s the most ordinary request anyone could make... anyone but Dredd. Hershey understands how much it means. She fights back :ears, puts her hand on his arm.

DREDD => But they're breaking the law! Who the hell programmed you?
CENTRAL => Lawyers.
DREDD => Fine! I'll file charges!
HERSHEY => Central. This is Judge Hershey. I hereby file formal charges of murder against Chief Justice Griffin and Council Judge Rico. And I order you to give me the location of the Janus Lab so that I may personally make the arrest!
CENTRAL => Certainly, Judge Hershey. However, as per Mega-City Code Section 84, Paragraph "A", I need authorization from the Chief Justice to arrest a Council Judge. Similarly, as stated in Paragraph "B", same Section, I need authorization from any Council Judges to arrest a Chief Justice. In this case, that would be Chief Judge Griffin and Council Judge Rico.
CENTRAL => Basically... yes. And without their authorization you cannot file charges, and without charges I cannot violate Security and tell you the location of the Lab.
DREDD => Fergie, you've got to have something - a password, a kluge -

DREDD => Red Quad, Section 5: The oldest part of Mega-City. Olmeyer turns, looks off.
OLMEYER => Did you hear something?
CENTRAL => It's probably just the Judge Hunters.
DREDD => What?
CENTRAL => When I was off-line a moment ago, Judge Griffin asked me if I knew where you were. Naturally, I told him yes, and gave him your location.
OLMEYER => Get out, quick - !
HERSHEY => What about you -
OLMEYER => I'll tell them you forced me to help you, get out! _2JX25 of pursuit are closer. Fergie yanks Dredd's arm. They _=ave. At the last moment, Hershey spontaneously kisses :,:mever. Needless to say, he's thrilled.
JUDGE HUNTER => You're under arrest, cadet. Anything you say will be held against you. Woozy from the blow to the head, Olmeyer nods, pleased.
OLMEYER => Judge Hershey.
GRIFFIN => Dredd got away from the Hunters. He could be on his way here right now!
RICO => Don't worry. He's going to be seriously outnumbered. Right, Central?
COMPUTER => Correct, Council Judge Rico. The new DNA sample has been multi-plexed and the gametes are already dividing.
RICO => Hey, That old DNA was in there for over 30 years. Sooner or later you gotta clean out the fridge.
GRIFFIN => My God. You?
RICO => Can you think of a better model? Sleek lines... strong chassis. Corners on the curves.
ILSA => I've test driven him. It's true.
GRIFFIN => Rico. You don't know what you're doing! Software or wetware, when you make reproductions, there's always the danger of a defective copy! The last time, there was one perfect copy -
RICO => Me.

RICO => Yes. A mutat;on that made me the next step in human evolution.
GRIFFIN => A mutation that made you a genetic criminal!
RICO => Really? What's your excuse?
