NICHOLAS =>  Thank you.
ILSA => Have a nice day.
NICHOLAS =>  ...until the dawn... making love till cherry's gone..  ... Erotic City, you and me...
MALE VOICE =>  ... might be perched up on majority shares, but you're not the only one who gets hurt if the actuals crash. Forecasts were fucked to begin with.
NICHOLAS =>  The moment Baer/Grant's P and L report is placed in my hand, I will be speed dialing your number.
MALE VOICE => Is that a promise?
NICHOLAS => I'm sorry... I'm unfamiliar with the term.
MALE VOICE => What if Alan calls me with a sob story about substantiation procedure?
NICHOLAS => Take evasive action: have your secretary say you're in a meeting. Goodbye, Jack.
MALE VOICE => Yeah.
MARIA => Invitations: the Museum Gala.
NICHOLAS => No.
NICHOLAS => The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
NICHOLAS => No.
NICHOLAS => The Hinchberger wedding.
NICHOLAS => Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
MARIA =>  I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
NICHOLAS => Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
ASSISTANT => Elizabeth on line three.
MARIA => Your ex-wife.
NICHOLAS => I know who she is.  Take a message.
ASSISTANT => Um... Happy Birthday, sir.
MARIA =>  Thank you, Maggie.
NICHOLAS => I don't like her.
MARIA => I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
NICHOLAS => What?
MARIA => A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
NICHOLAS => What gentleman, Maria?
MARIA => A Mister... Seymour Butts.
NICHOLAS =>  "Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
MARIA => Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
NICHOLAS => Cancel lunch.  Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
NICHOLAS => And, put the reservation in my name.
WAITRESS => Ready to order, sir?
NICHOLAS => I'm still waiting...
NICHOLAS => Excuse me...
NICHOLAS => This was iced tea.
CONRAD => Hey there, Nickie.
NICHOLAS =>  Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
CONRAD => Happy Birthday, man.
NICHOLAS =>  "Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
CONRAD => That's why it's a classic.  Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
CONRAD => They gave me a free jacket at the door.
NICHOLAS => They'll be wanting it back.
CONRAD => Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
NICHOLAS => Which grad-school?
NICHOLAS => You look good.
CONRAD => So do you.  And to think I was worried...
NICHOLAS => About me?
CONRAD => How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
NICHOLAS => Never better.
CONRAD => Elizabeth?
NICHOLAS => Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
CONRAD => Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
NICHOLAS => I redecorated.  What about you?
CONRAD => Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
NICHOLAS => Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
CONRAD => Yeah.
NICHOLAS => You need anything?
CONRAD => No.
NICHOLAS => Really?
CONRAD => I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
CONRAD => For you.
NICHOLAS => You shouldn't have.
CONRAD => What do you get for the man who has just slightly more than everything?
CONRAD => Call that number.
NICHOLAS => "Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
CONRAD => Trust me.  Call that number.
NICHOLAS => Why?
CONRAD => They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
NICHOLAS => Fun?
CONRAD => You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
NICHOLAS => This isn't an escort service?
CONRAD => It's a profound life experience.
NICHOLAS => Like a stroke?
CONRAD => Call them.  Trust me.
WAITRESS => Sorry.  Let me get you another napkin.
NICHOLAS => I'll be fine... if we could just...
CONRAD => Tell me you'll call.
NICHOLAS => Okay.
CONRAD => Will you?
NICHOLAS => I said I would...
CONRAD => But, will you?
NICHOLAS => Are you still on mediction?
CONRAD =>  Why would you say that?
WAITRESS => Ready to order, gentlemen?
NICHOLAS =>  I didn't mean it like it sounded...
CONRAD => I'm not on anything anymore.  I'm not even seeing a shrink.  I'm happy. (notices waitress, turning to her) Do you mind... ?!
CONRAD =>  I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...
NICHOLAS => I'll call them, okay?
CONRAD => It doesn't matter...
NICHOLAS => I'm going to call.
CONRAD => Do it for YOU.
NICHOLAS => Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
CONRAD => I know...
FEMALE VOICE =>  ... seen the profitability report. No one's happy with the numbers.
NICHOLAS =>  Imagine how much MORE unhappy I am.
FEMALE VOICE => You'll deal with Alan?
NICHOLAS => Correct.
FEMALE VOICE => Okay, Nicholas.  Sleep well.
NICHOLAS => I plan to.
ILSA => Dinner's in the oven.
NICHOLAS => Thank you.  Goodnight.
NICHOLAS => Oh, I saw Conrad today.
ILSA => You did?  How is he?
NICHOLAS => Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
ILSA =>  Well... send my love, if you see him again.
NICHOLAS =>  Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH =>  Happy Birthday, Nick.
NICHOLAS =>  Eleven forty.  You almost didn't make it this year.
ELIZABETH => Did you have a great birthday?
NICHOLAS => Does Rose Kennedy have a black dress? You know my parties.  I went not once, but twice through the spanking-machine.
ELIZABETH => I can only imagine.  How are you?
NICHOLAS => Connie asked me the same thing today.
ELIZABETH => Connie, really?  I always liked him.
NICHOLAS => Anyway...
ELIZABETH => I just thought this... might be difficult for you.
NICHOLAS => Just another birthday.
ELIZABETH => I meant because of your father.
NICHOLAS => That's right.  He was forty, wasn't he?  Hadn't thought about it, to tell you the truth, thanks for the reminder.
ELIZABETH => Why do I call you... ?
NICHOLAS => I honestly don't know.  Listen, give my best to Doctor Mel and Rachel....
ELIZABETH => Sue has a little brother on the way. We just did the ultrasound.
NICHOLAS => No kidding?  An official nuclear family.  You must be pleased.
ELIZABETH => We are.  We couldn't be happier.
NICHOLAS => Well, so... thanks for calling.  I've got some work here...
ELIZABETH => I should let you go.
NICHOLAS => Take care of yourself.
ELIZABETH => You too, Nicholas.  I mean that, I really do.
NICHOLAS => Um-hm.  Good luck.  Bye.
EXECUTIVE 1 => We're getting off here.
NICHOLAS =>  So, we understand each other?
EXECUTIVE 2 => We do.
NICHOLAS => Make it work on paper, and you can count on my full support.
EXECUTIVE 1 => Right-o.  We'll talk.  Soon.
NICHOLAS =>  Is this Consumer Recreation Services... ?
RECEPTIONIST =>  You shouldn't feel this reflects negatively upon yourself.  Just a moment.  We hope we haven't caused you any inconvenience.  Thank you for considering C.R.S.
RECEPTIONIST => Mister Feingold... could you assist this gentleman?
FEINGOLD => Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
NICHOLAS => I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
FEINGOLD => Oh, here we go...
FEINGOLD =>  Excellent.  Let's get started.
FEINGOLD => Sorry about about all the hullabaloo. We're still moving.  Stick with me... I've got an office around here somewhere.
FEINGOLD => Mind holding this... ?
FEINGOLD =>  V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
NICHOLAS => What is?
FEINGOLD =>  Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
NICHOLAS => No, thank you.
FEINGOLD =>  You need to fill out those forms. Application, psych-tests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T.  For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like.  We'll run a T.R.W....
NICHOLAS =>  "I sometimes hurt small animals. True or False?"  "I feel guilty when I masturbate..."
FEINGOLD => I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
NICHOLAS => What's all this for?
FEINGOLD => We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
NICHOLAS => No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
FEINGOLD => Oh... it's a game.
NICHOLAS => A game?
FEINGOLD => Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
NICHOLAS => What kind of vacation?
FEINGOLD => It's different every time.
NICHOLAS =>  Humor me with specifics.
FEINGOLD => We provide whatever's lacking.
NICHOLAS => And if nothing's lacking?
FEINGOLD => May I make two suggestions... ?
NICHOLAS => Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
FEINGOLD => First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  Second, you don't have to decide today.  Take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  One day, the game begins.  You either love it or hate it.  Decide then.  We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  That was my sales pitch.
NICHOLAS => How long will these take?
FEINGOLD => An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
NICHOLAS => Physical?
FEINGOLD => Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
NICHOLAS =>  ... cancel.  Push Cooper back to Wednesday afternoon.
MARIA =>  Mister Sutherland called about Baer/Grant Publishing.
NICHOLAS =>  Tomorrow.  Hold on...  How much longer?
NURSE => Almost done.
NICHOLAS => I heard that two hours ago.
NICHOLAS => Hello... ?  Anyone there?  Hello?!
FEINGOLD => Sorry to keep you waiting.
NICHOLAS => Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
FEINGOLD => It's all down to this...
FEINGOLD => An insurance company requirement.  It states that you are aware "the game" exists and that you are a willing participant in said game, so on and so forth.
FEINGOLD =>  One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
NICHOLAS =>  You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
FEINGOLD => It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
NICHOLAS => You mean, dissatisfied.
FEINGOLD =>  That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
FEINGOLD => Initials... initials, and...  Sign here.
FEINGOLD => In blood.  Just kidding.
FEINGOLD => Your copies, thank you.  Keep the pen.  We'll let you know.
NICHOLAS =>  ... grown man just winked at me.
CONRAD => What about Monday or Tuesday?
NICHOLAS => Bad for me.
CONRAD => How 'bout tonight?
NICHOLAS => Unfortunately I'm working all evening.  Wednesday's the only possibility right now...
CONRAD => Okay.
NICHOLAS => Dinner?
CONRAD => Fine.  I get to pick the restaurant.
NICHOLAS => By the way, I went to C.R.S...
CONRAD => Really?  What'd you think?
NICHOLAS => They seemed disorganized.
CONRAD => Well, the office is new.  When I did it in London, they'd been around awhile.  You gonna do this?
NICHOLAS => Haven't decided yet.
BUSINESSMAN 1 => ... getting in on the ground floor of the next Disneyland.
BUSINESSMAN 2 => C.R.S. will not go public.  They're family owned.
BUSINESSMAN 1 => Stranger things have happened.
BUSINESSMAN 2 => No, they haven't, actually.
BUSINESSMAN 1 => They just opened here.
BUSINESSMAN 2 => The game in San Francisco?  You see, they're doing fine without any of us.
NICHOLAS => New members?
BARTENDER => I believe so, sir.
NICHOLAS => This round's on me.
BUSINESSMAN 1 => ... last time I played Pebble, I swore I'd never pick up a club again.
NICHOLAS => Speaking of games... I couldn't help but overhear you talking about C.R.S.
NICHOLAS => I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
BUSINESSMAN 2 => Did you?  Kudos.
BUSINESSMAN 1 => So, yours hasn't started?
NICHOLAS => Not yet.  I was hoping you could tell me... uh...  What is it?
BUSINESSMAN 1 =>  Ahh, what is it?
BUSINESSMAN 2 => The eternal question.
BUSINESSMAN 1 =>  I envy you.  I wish I could go back and do it for the first time all over again...
BUSINESSMAN 1 => Here's to... new experiences.  If you'll excuse me, I've got to be going.  'Night, Jon... Nicholas.
NICHOLAS => Did you play recently?
BUSINESSMAN 2 => Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
NICHOLAS =>  I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
BUSINESSMAN 2 => You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
NICHOLAS => I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
BUSINESSMAN 2 => "Whereas once I was blind, now I can see."  Night, Nick.  Best of luck.
NICHOLAS =>  As far as I'm concerned...  ... if the Baer/Grant meeting does not take place tommorow, it might as well never take place at all.
SUTHERLAND => When Mr. Van Orton boards his plane in the morrow, he will have every contract, side agreement and addendum, the complete closing package, flawlessly revised.
SUTHERLAND => Ladies and gentlemen...  This is why you're paid twice what you deserve.  So you will miss another opera you would've fallen asleep during anyway...
SUTHERLAND => The meeting has been moved forward. It affords you the opportunity to show our client how well you will rise to his exhilarating challenge.
NICHOLAS =>  Yes?
WOMAN =>  Nicholas van Orton?
NICHOLAS => Yes, who is this?
WOMAN => This is Cynthia calling from C.R.S...
NICHOLAS => How did you get this number?
WOMAN => We've finished processing your application...
NICHOLAS => I'm in a meeting...
WOMAN => ... I'm afraid your application was rejected.
NICHOLAS =>  Pardon me?
WOMAN => You shouldn't feel this reflects negatively upon yourself.  We hope we haven't caused you any inconvenience...
NICHOLAS => This is absurd...
WOMAN => Thank you for thinking of C.R.S.
SUTHERLAND => Anything wrong... ?
NICHOLAS => Nothing.  Nothing at all.
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR => Would you like voice-mail?
NICHOLAS => I suppose.
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR => I'll connect you.  Thank you for calling the Four Seasons.
CONRAD =>  This is Conrad.  Leave a message.
NICHOLAS =>  Connie, it's Nicholas.  Give me a ring when you get a chance...
NICHOLAS => About your birthday gift.  Things are tight right now.  I'm just not sure whether it'll fit my schedule. Anyway, see you at dinner tomorrow.
NICHOLAS => Hello!  What are you doing there?  Wonderful...
NICHOLAS => Are you okay?
BERNARD SHAW =>  ... according to Nicholas Van Orton, millions of Americans will be affected by this legislation.
BERNARD SHAW => ... number of criminals behind bars growing by record numbers, with Van Orton pointing the finger at stiff, anti-crime regulations...
BERNARD SHAW => ... largest portion of population incarcerated.  These figures were given at a press conference called toady by Mr. Nicholas Van Orton.
BERNARD SHAW => You going to spend the rest of the evening prying at that clown's mouth?
NICHOLAS =>  I... I don't...
BERNARD SHAW => It's frustrating for me if you don't even pretend to pay attention.
NICHOLAS => What is this... ?
BERNARD SHAW => This is your game, Nicholas, and welcome to it.  I'm here to let you in on a few ground rules...
BERNARD SHAW => You've received the first key and others will follow.  You never know where you'll find them, or when or how you'll need to use them, so keep your eyes open.
NICHOLAS =>  How do you... ?  You can see me?
BERNARD SHAW => I see you, I hear you.  Why don't we save the questions till...
NICHOLAS => How does this work?
BERNARD SHAW => There's a tiny camera looking at you right now.
NICHOLAS => That's impossible.
BERNARD SHAW => You're right.  Impossible.  You're having a conversation with your television.
BERNARD SHAW => It's miniaturized.
BERNARD SHAW => Do you know how dangerous that is?
ILSA => Mister Van Orton... ?
NICHOLAS => Yes... Ilsa, what is it?
BERNARD SHAW => ... and in other news, auto workers vowed to remain on picket lines...
ILSA => Is everything alright?
NICHOLAS => Fine.
ILSA => I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
NICHOLAS => No, thank you.  Goodnight.
ILSA => Goodnight then.
BERNARD SHAW => Who was that?
NICHOLAS => Never mind who that was.
BERNARD SHAW => You're uncomfortable.  You want to know how a camera got into your home, don't you?
NICHOLAS => Yes, I do.
BERNARD SHAW =>  ... cold... cold... warmer... warmer...
BERNARD SHAW => Write this number down.  It's a 24-hour Consumer Recreation Services hotline, for emergencies only.
BERNARD SHAW => But, don't call asking what the object of the game is; figuring that out is the object of the game.
BERNARD SHAW => Good luck and congratulations on choosing C.R.S.  We now return you to your regularly scheduled program...
HOMELESS BUM => Help me out there?  Used to be an affluent fella, till some folks did this to me...
HOMELESS BUM => Don't ignore me.  I got screwed.
MOTHER => Excuse me...
NICHOLAS =>  May I help you... ?
NICHOLAS => What... ?  What is it?
DEEP VOICE => Hey, buddy... you still out there?
DEEP VOICE =>  I'm in a little bit of trouble...
DEEP VOICE => I need paper.  There's none in here. Come on, help a guy out...
DEEP VOICE => Hello?!  Anybody?  Hello?
SECURITY GUARD => Nice watch.
NICHOLAS => Is there a problem?
NICHOLAS => I wasn't expecting you.
SUTHERLAND => Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
SUTHERLAND => Attractive...
NICHOLAS =>  Don't ask.
SUTHERLAND => I checked it personally.
ALAN BAER => All these years... the first time ever you step foot in these offices, it's to ask me to step down?
NICHOLAS => You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
ALAN BAER => Projections were far too optimistic.
NICHOLAS => Admittedly...
ALAN BAER => Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
NICHOLAS => But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
ALAN BAER => Will you really hold me to it over pennies?
NICHOLAS => My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
ALAN BAER => The stock will turn.
NICHOLAS => It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
ALAN BAER => Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
NICHOLAS => You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
ALAN BAER => You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
NICHOLAS => What?
ALAN BAER => Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
NICHOLAS => It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
ALAN BAER => Now, look...
NICHOLAS =>  I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
ALAN BAER => There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
NICHOLAS => Remember Daniel Grant?  Do they say, "without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?"  He's gone sailing, Alan.  He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are.
NICHOLAS => You made a promise.  You failed.  The severance I'm offering is more than equitable.  Valid tonight only.  For one hour.
NICHOLAS => I'll step outside, so you'll have the privacy you need to read and sign it.
ALAN BAER => I could fight you on this.
NICHOLAS => You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
NICHOLAS => So... it is in your best interest... to sign presently.
NICHOLAS => Well... as luck would have it, you've just gotten a reprieve,  I'm sure you'll come around to my way of thinking.  I have a plane to catch.  My attorneys will contact you.
NICHOLAS => Is there a message up front from a Conrad Van Orton?
WAITRESS => Oh, excuse me...
CHRISTINE => I'm so sorry.
NICHOLAS => Please, don't do that...
CHRISTINE => I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
NICHOLAS => A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
NICHOLAS => Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
CHRISTINE =>  It was an accident.
NICHOLAS => Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
CHRISTINE => I said I was sorry...
CHRISTINE =>  Asshole.
MAITRE D' => Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
CHRISTINE => Then, you kiss his ass.
MAITRE D' => You don't talk to me like that.
CHRISTINE =>  I apologized, I offered to help.
MAITRE D' => Clean out your locker.
CHRISTINE => Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
MAITRE D' => I'll be right with you.
MAITRE D' => I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Van Orton. If you're not too uncomfortable, will this table suit you for a complimentary meal... ?
NICHOLAS => Yes.  Fine.
MAITRE D' => I'll fetch your waiter.
WAITER => Check, sir.
NICHOLAS => Excuse me...
CHRISTINE =>  Yeah... ?  Well, fuck you and your vichyssoise, prick.
NICHOLAS => Pardon me... Miss... ?
CHRISTINE => Oh, no... you.
NICHOLAS => I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
CHRISTINE => What are you babbling about, psycho?
NICHOLAS => I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
CHRISTINE => What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
NICHOLAS => Excuse me, I need to explain...
CHRISTINE => Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
NICHOLAS => Son of a bitch!
NICHOLAS =>  I'm trying to... ask you...  I'm apologizing...
NICHOLAS =>  Are... are you okay?!
NICHOLAS => Jesus... this can't be...
CHRISTINE => What's with him?
NICHOLAS => I don't know... he fell.
CHRISTINE => Do you know what to do?
NICHOLAS => I don't think he's breathing.
NICHOLAS => Oh, God... !
CHRISTINE => Don't just stand there, get help!
NICHOLAS =>  This can't be real...
CHRISTINE => He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
NICHOLAS => Alright... okay...
CHRISTINE => He's turning blue!
NICHOLAS => Damn...
NICHOLAS => Police!
COP ONE => You have to fill these out.
NICHOLAS => I don't know this man.
CHRISTINE =>  What do you need... ?
NICHOLAS =>  I can't get involved in this.
COP TWO =>  We'll have to detain you.
COP ONE => Report's got to be filled out.  Ride with your wife.  We'll meet at the hospital.
PARAMEDIC =>  We're moving!
NICHOLAS => She's not my wife.
COP ONE => It's a few blocks.  Help me out, huh, pal?
NICHOLAS => This is nuts.
CHRISTINE =>  What is your problem?
NICHOLAS =>  Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner.  I get a note...
NICHOLAS => Suddenly I'm in an ambulance.  Why am I in an ambulance?!
NICHOLAS =>  He's breathing, isn't he?  Is the siren entirely necessary?
CHRISTINE => Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
NICHOLAS =>  Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
NICHOLAS => You've got to be kidding.
CHRISTINE => What... is... happening... ?
NICHOLAS =>  I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
CHRISTINE => A game?
NICHOLAS =>  It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
CHRISTINE => What are you talking about?
NICHOLAS => The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
CHRISTINE => You mean, the guy who turned blue and wet himself... ?
NICHOLAS => I'm sorry, about this...
CHRISTINE => You should be.
CHRISTINE => There's got to be a flashlight.
NICHOLAS =>  I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
CHRISTINE => This is so fucked.  You don't fuck with people like this.  I thought that guy was gonna die.  I gave him mouth to mouth!
CHRISTINE => See you around.
NICHOLAS => Where are you going?
CHRISTINE => Home.
NICHOLAS => How do you know that's the way?
CHRISTINE => Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
NICHOLAS => It was a gift... from my brother.
CHRISTINE => How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
NICHOLAS => Ground floor.
NICHOLAS =>  Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
CHRISTINE => Never mind.
CHRISTINE => I don't like that.  We're stuck.
NICHOLAS =>  No signal.
CHRISTINE => What's the going rate for the "trapped-in-elevator-adventure" these days?
NICHOLAS => Don't even think about it.
CHRISTINE => Why not?
NICHOLAS => Read what it says: "Warning, do not attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
CHRISTINE => If there was one.
NICHOLAS => "... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
CHRISTINE => Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
NICHOLAS => I'll give you a boost.
CHRISTINE => You first.
NICHOLAS => This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
CHRISTINE => You pull me up.
NICHOLAS => It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
CHRISTINE => No.
NICHOLAS => Please...
CHRISTINE => I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
NICHOLAS =>  Oh.  FIne.
CHRISTINE => Oops.
NICHOLAS => There's a ladder here.
CHRISTINE => My hero.  Let's go.
NICHOLAS => I don't think so.
NICHOLAS => Damn.  My briefcase.
CHRISTINE => I'll wait.
NICHOLAS =>  It's not like anyone could actually open it.
NICHOLAS => This is C.R.S.
CHRISTINE => What's C.R.S.?
NICHOLAS => Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...
NICHOLAS => Oh...
NICHOLAS => Don't panic.  When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
CHRISTINE => They'll love that.
NICHOLAS => Yes... well...
CHRISTINE =>  Explain for both of us!
NICHOLAS => Walk, slowly.  Don't draw attention. Out for a stroll...
ANGRY VOICE => You!  Stay where you are!
CHRISTINE => Run!
ANGRY VOICE => Stop!
NICHOLAS => Where are you going?  You can't fit there.
NICHOLAS => I can't!
NICHOLAS => You deserted me.
CHRISTINE => You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
NICHOLAS => You're the one who started running.
CHRISTINE => Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
NICHOLAS => Climb!
CHRISTINE => Now what?
NICHOLAS => Follow me...
CHRISTINE => Shut up, you stupid, fucking dogs!!
CHRISTINE => What are they guarding around here? Each other?
NICHOLAS => There goes a thousand dollars.
CHRISTINE => Your shoes cost a thousand dollars?
NICHOLAS => That one did.
CHRISTINE =>  ... two hundred dollars a toe.
NICHOLAS => Let me guess.  Me first?
CHRISTINE =>  This is getting out of hand.
CHRISTINE => Never did catch your name.
NICHOLAS => Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
CHRISTINE => Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
CHRISTINE =>  That's classic.
NICHOLAS =>  Why... ?
CHRISTINE => We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
NICHOLAS => I think not.
CHRISTINE => Afraid you're going to ruin your one-legged suit?
NICHOLAS => Be careful...
CHRISTINE => What are they... ?  Hey!
NICHOLAS => Are you okay... ?!
CHRISTINE => I'm okay... I'm okay, thank you...
NICHOLAS => Table for two, please.
CHRISTINE => Where are we going?
NICHOLAS =>  That tall, bright building.  Near there.
POLICEMAN => Everything okay, miss?
CHRISTINE => Yeah.  How are you?
NICHOLAS => There's a shower, if you'd like.
CHRISTINE => A shower in your office?  You an athlete or something?
CHRISTINE => What exactly do you do?
NICHOLAS => Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
CHRISTINE => Nice.
NICHOLAS => Hm?  Oh, yes.
NICHOLAS => A fresh shirt...
CHRISTINE =>  If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
NICHOLAS => I don't spend much time looking out the window.  I'll call you a taxi.
NICHOLAS => Oh!  Uh...
CHRISTINE => Thanks.
NICHOLAS => I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
CHRISTINE => Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
NICHOLAS => Goodnight.
CHRISTINE => I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
NICHOLAS => The maitre d' called you Christine.
CHRISTINE =>  Right.  Call me Christy.
NICHOLAS => Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
CHRISTINE => Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
NICHOLAS => Keep it.
CHRISTINE => I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
NICHOLAS => Seriously?  What did they say?
CHRISTINE => They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
NICHOLAS =>  Hel... hello?
MARIA =>  Mr. Van Orton, it's Maria.  I... I wasn't sure I should call...
NICHOLAS =>  What time is it?
MARIA =>  Eleven o'clock.  I took the liberty of rescheduling your nine a.m. with Allison and Dietrich.  Are you... not not feeling well?
NICHOLAS => I'll be in in an hour.  I left my briefcase at fifteen-thirty-three Montgomery.  Check with their lost and found.
MARIA => Alan Baer's in town, at the Ritz-Carlton.
NICHOLAS => Really?
MARIA => He's requesting dinner tonight.
NICHOLAS => We'll let him know.
MARIA => Also, the Claremont Hotel called to say they have your American Express card at the front desk.  You left it last night?
MARIA => Should I send someone... ?
NICHOLAS => No.  Give me their number.
MARIA => Eight, four, three, three-thousand.
NICHOLAS => See  you in awhile.  Goodbye.
HOTEL MANAGER =>  Claremont Resort and Spa.
NICHOLAS =>  This is Nicholas Van Orton.  I'm told my American Express card...
HOTEL MANAGER =>  Yes, Mister Van Orton.  Everything's in order.  The concierge has arranged for the wine and flowers in the room.
NICHOLAS => Has he?
HOTEL MANAGER => And, a young woman phoned just now to say she's on route but running a little late.
NICHOLAS =>  Did this young woman leave her name?
HOTEL MANAGER => I'm sure I don't know.
NICHOLAS => Thank you.
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR => There's no answer.  Would you like his voice mail?
NICHOLAS => Tell him his brother called, and to call back soon as he can.
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR => Yes, sir.
THIN MAN => Sorry.  My fault.
HOTEL MANAGER => Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
NICHOLAS => Have we met?
HOTEL MANAGER => I believe so.  If you would jsut sign here...
HOTEL MANAGER => Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
NICHOLAS => The key?
HOTEL MANAGER => Hm?
NICHOLAS => Is there a room key?
HOTEL MANAGER => Didn't I give you two?
NICHOLAS => No, you didn't...
NICHOLAS => Cute.
NICHOLAS => I'll take it from here.
NICHOLAS => Hello... ?
MAID =>  Time to make up the room.
NICHOLAS => Could you come back later?
MAID => Yes, sir.  Sorry.
PLUMP GUY => What the fuck... ?!
NICHOLAS => Why are you following me?
PLUMP GUY => I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just driving...
PLUMP GUY =>  Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
NICHOLAS => Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
PLUMP GUY =>  Friend... why don't you back off.
PLUMP GUY => Hey... !
NICHOLAS =>  Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
PLUMP GUY => Okay, I'm a private investigator. Somebody hired me to keep tabs on you...
NICHOLAS => Who... who hired you?
MARIA =>  Mister Van Orton's office...
NICHOLAS =>  Maria.  Have Sutherland meet me at the Ritz-Carlton.  I'm on my way there now.
MARIA => May I tell him... ?
SUTHERLAND => What's happened...
NICHOLAS => Follow me.
ALAN BAER => Nicholas... this is unexpected.
NICHOLAS => Do you actually believe that because you publish children's books, anyone's going to care about my reputation?
NICHOLAS => You could print pictures of me wearing nipple rings and butt-fucking Captain Kangaroo... all anyone would wonder was whether the stock was up, or down.
DAUGHTER => Daddy... ?
ALAN BAER => It's alright, dear.  Mr. Van Orton...
SUTHERLAND => Nicholas...
NICHOLAS =>  That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
ALAN BAER => Are you finished?
NICHOLAS => No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
ALAN BAER => We met, this morning.  I signed the termination contract for Baer/Grace. I accepted your settlement, Nicholas. you were right.  I'm going sailing.
ALAN BAER => You're welcome to join our luncheon. Maybe we can straighten this our.  My wife, Mary Carol, and my daughter-in-law, Kaliegh.
NICHOLAS => It seems I've...  please, disregard my apparently misguided remarks.
SUTHERLAND => Well...
SUTHERLAND => Enjoy your lunch.
SUTHERLAND => How concerned should I be?
NICHOLAS => It was a misunderstanding.
NICHOLAS => Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
SUTHERLAND => You know you can.
NICHOLAS => Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
SUTHERLAND => Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
NICHOLAS => Just what I told you.
SUTHERLAND => Nothing else?
NICHOLAS => They gave me their waiver.  On their... wait...
SUTHERLAND => What is this?
NICHOLAS =>  Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
SUTHERLAND => You're joking.
NICHOLAS => It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
SUTHERLAND => Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
NICHOLAS => Sam...  Thank you.
NICHOLAS =>  Maria.  The other night... last night, there was a woman here named Christine.  I called a taxi, from that company we use...
MARIA =>  Elite?
NICHOLAS => What?
MARIA => Elite Taxi Company?
NICHOLAS => Look into it.  Find out which car answered and where they took her.
NICHOLAS => Ilsa?
NICHOLAS => Ilsa!?
NICHOLAS => I've got a gun!
NICHOLAS => ... fuckers...
ILSA => Mr. Van Orton... ?
NICHOLAS => Ilsa... you're alright?
ILSA => Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
NICHOLAS => Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
ILSA => I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
NICHOLAS => There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
ILSA => Be careful!
911 OPERATOR =>  Nine-one-one, emergency...
NICHOLAS =>  I need the police.  There's been a break-in at my home...
911 OPERATOR =>  Okay, sir.  Stay on the line and give me your address...
NICHOLAS =>  Twenty-two Moore Street.  At the corner of Moore and Buchanan.
911 OPERATOR => Now, sir, you said it was a break-in...
NICHOLAS => Yes...
911 OPERATOR => Are you sure they're gone... ?
911 OPERATOR => ... are you sure there's not still someone somewhere in the house?
NICHOLAS => I... don't think so.
NICHOLAS => Oh God...
911 OPERATOR => Hello?  Are you still there?
CONRAD => Meet me out front!
NICHOLAS => Tell me where we're going.
CONRAD => Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
NICHOLAS => What's this all about, Connie?
CONRAD => Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
NICHOLAS => What are you doing?
CONRAD => They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
NICHOLAS => Who?
CONRAD => C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
NICHOLAS =>  Yeah, almost...
CONRAD => You dodged a bullet.
NICHOLAS => How do you mean, exactly?
CONRAD => They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the real fucking begins.
NICHOLAS => Slow down, take a breath...
CONRAD => It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
NICHOLAS => What have they been doing to you?
CONRAD => Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
NICHOLAS => Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
CONRAD => You think I know?  I paid them more to make it stop.
CONRAD => What the hell... !?
CONRAD => It's them.  They did this.
NICHOLAS => It's a flat tire.  That's all.
CONRAD => How do you know?
NICHOLAS => We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
CONRAD => Okay... okay.
NICHOLAS => The phone's dead.
CONRAD => Really?
NICHOLAS => Do you know how to change a tire?
CONRAD => No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
NICHOLAS => Check the glove box... might be another battery there.
NICHOLAS => How did those... ?
CONRAD => You're part of it...
NICHOLAS => What?  Connie...
CONRAD => No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
NICHOLAS => No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
CONRAD => You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
NICHOLAS => Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
CONRAD => Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
NICHOLAS => Stop this.  It's not true...
CONRAD => I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
NICHOLAS => Stop it!
NICHOLAS =>  Connie!
NICHOLAS =>  You sons-of-bitches...
MAN =>  Flippy?  Is Flippy there?  Flippy?
RECORDING =>  If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and...
RECORDING =>  We're sorry.  The number you have dialed has been disconnected or is no longer in service...
NICHOLAS => Twenty-two Moore Street.
NICHOLAS =>  Um... you want to turn here...  Excuse me, you missed the turn.
NICHOLAS => Did you hear me?  You're...
NICHOLAS => No... no, no, no.  Stop the car!
NICHOLAS => Listen.  I am a very wealthy man. Whatever they're paying you, I'll double it!
NICHOLAS =>  It's a game... it's a game...
GIRL => Hey, mister... are you alright?
GIRL => You could get hepatitis from that water.
NICHOLAS => I need the police.
GIRL => Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
NICHOLAS => You know, these fit... perfectly.
GIRL => They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
GIRL => I've been so lonely.
NICHOLAS => I can't tell you how not interested I am.
GIRL => Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
NICHOLAS => Don't take another step.
GIRL => Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
NICHOLAS => First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
GIRL => Don't you want your thing?  I was supposed to give you this thing.
FEMALE DETECTIVE => Management for the building says that space hasn't been officially rented yet.  The county recorder has no listing for "Consumer Recreation Services" or any derivation thereof. No sign of the boat or the girl. We're checking escort services, but it's unlikely.  Divers are looking for the taxi, and soon as they find it they'll pull the plates and V.I.N.
MALE DETECTIVE => Have you gotten in touch with your brother?
NICHOLAS => He hasn't called back.
SUTHERLAND => What about the house?
MALE DETECTIVE => The graffiti was painted in an oil-based marine marking solution. Illegal in the states.  Not impossible to trace, but it'll take time.
FEMALE DETECTIVE => The photos, gun, the clown, the ambulance, cable box, everything else... it's all pending.  Breaking and entering we have, solid. Malicious mischief, vandalism, harassment.  But, that's about all.
SUTHERLAND => Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
NICHOLAS => Attempted murder.
MALE DETECTIVE => Except... you said you hired these people.
MALE DETECTIVE => It's our job to let you know what we have.  We haven't got motive.
FEMALE DETECTIVE =>  You are who you are, so we know you're not making it up.  But, we've never dealt with anything quite like this.  Be appropriately cautious.  Unless you think they're done with you.
NICHOLAS => What was my father like?
ILSA => What makes you ask?
NICHOLAS => I'm not sure.
ILSA => All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
NICHOLAS => He came to my mind recently, that's all.
ILSA => Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
NICHOLAS => Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
ILSA => No.  What happened... no one expected it.
NICHOLAS => Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
ILSA => Not much, I think.
NICHOLAS => I'm just like him.
ILSA => You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
NICHOLAS => Did you worry about him?
ILSA => Nobody worried about your father.
NICHOLAS =>  Hello.
MARIA =>  It's Maria.  I found the address you wanted from Elite Taxi.
NICHOLAS =>  Go ahead...
CHRISTINE'S DAD => Yeah?
NICHOLAS => Hello.  Is Christine in?
CHRISTINE'S DAD => She's sleeping.
CHRISTINE => Who is it, dad?
CHRISTINE => What are you doing here?
NICHOLAS => Can we talk?
CHRISTINE => It's okay, dad.
CHRISTINE => Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
NICHOLAS => Come here...
NICHOLAS => What can you tell me about this?
CHRISTINE => What is it?
NICHOLAS => Is this you?
CHRISTINE => Where'd you get this?
NICHOLAS => It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
CHRISTINE => I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
NICHOLAS => Well... the red bra.
CHRISTINE =>  Okay.
NICHOLAS => I thought...
NICHOLAS => Do you mind if I sit?
CHRISTINE => Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
NICHOLAS =>  I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
CHRISTINE => Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
NICHOLAS => Do you have any aspirin?
CHRISTINE => Want anything to drink?
NICHOLAS =>  You?
CHRISTINE => Yeah.  First Communion.  Aren't I a little angel?
NICHOLAS => Take the picture out.
CHRISTINE => What's wrong?
NICHOLAS => Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
CHRISTINE => I don't...
CHRISTINE => They're watching.
NICHOLAS => Wha... ?
CHRISTINE =>  Not here!  They can see.
CHRISTINE =>  So, what do you say we go for a drive?  We'll take your car...
NICHOLAS => No!  I'm sick of this...
CHRISTINE => Nicholas...
NICHOLAS => You can come out now, if you're there.  Come on out!  Let's go!
CHRISTINE => Now you've done it!
NICHOLAS => What?  Oh, and I suppose they're going to...
CHRISTINE => Get down!
CHRISTINE'S DAD => What the hell... !?
NICHOLAS => What is this!?
CHRISTINE => God, wake up, it's a con!
CHRISTINE => Look out!
CHRISTINE =>  Okay... they're gone...
CHRISTINE => What are you doing... ?
NICHOLAS => Get out.
CHRISTINE => I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
NICHOLAS => Get out of my car!
CHRISTINE => You don't have a choice.  No one else is going to tell you what's going on.
CHRISTINE => Do you want to know?  If I'm gone, you never will.
NICHOLAS => You can talk while I drive us to the police.
CHRISTINE => No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
CHRISTINE => I can't believe they didn't take the time to get the house right.
NICHOLAS => Who are "they?"
CHRISTINE => I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
NICHOLAS => Then, what good are you?
CHRISTINE => I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
NICHOLAS => That's a lie...
CHRISTINE => Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, before you started the game.
CHRISTINE => It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
NICHOLAS => How?  How could they have gotten anything?
CHRISTINE => They did the same to him as they did to you.
NICHOLAS => What are you talking about... ?
CHRISTINE => They've already got it, Nicholas. They got everything.
CHRISTINE => Check your accounts.  That night in your office, when we were there...
CHRISTINE => I got the number to your private line and modem.  I gave C.R.S. remote access to your computer...
CHRISTINE => You already gave them everything else.  Handwriting, voice samples, psych-info.  They used it all to figure out your passwords.
CHRISTINE => From there, they only had to keep you distracted while they broke into the network and transferred your holdings to dummy accounts.
CHRISTINE => Remember Jim Feingold, the guy who signed you up?  He did five years for hacking Citibank in eighty-four...
CHRISTINE => Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
NICHOLAS =>  Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
CHRISTINE => They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
NICHOLAS =>  Guten tag.  Vilen dank, Englisch. Blue-two-backslash-five.  Mother's maiden name: Miller.  Six-nine-zero, D as in David.  Yes.  The balance...  That's impossible.  When did... ?
CHRISTINE => They got everything.
NICHOLAS =>  Call soon as you get this message, Sam.  I checked them all, I don't know how, but they drained my accounts.  Now they're trying to kill me.  You tell the cops, I've got one with me.  We'll make her testify.  I know how it must sound.  Call on my mobile.  Be careful
CLERK =>  They say I have to take the card.
CHRISTINE =>  I think I've got some cash.
CHRISTINE => What?
CHRISTINE => What did you say?
NICHOLAS => I didn't say anything.
CHRISTINE =>  My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...
NICHOLAS => Who the fuck cares?
CHRISTINE => It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
NICHOLAS => It might be best if we didn't talk.
CHRISTINE => All I mean is... someone like you...
NICHOLAS => How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
CHRISTINE => What?
NICHOLAS => Scams, con games.  How many?
CHRISTINE => I don't know.  A lot.
NICHOLAS => Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
NICHOLAS =>  Yes.
SUTHERLAND =>  I got your message.  I was disturbed, to say the least...
CHRISTINE => Who is it?
NICHOLAS =>  What do we do?
SUTHERLAND =>  I've been on the phone for an hour already.  Nicholas, your funds are intact.  Nothing's been touched.
CHRISTINE =>  Who is it?
NICHOLAS =>  What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
SUTHERLAND => Nothing's changed.  I'm telling you, not a cent is unaccounted for...
NICHOLAS =>  My lawyer... says nothing's missing.
CHRISTINE =>  He's in on it...
SUTHERLAND => I don't know what's happening, but stay where you are till I get to you. Give me your precise location...
CHRISTINE => Sutherland's in on it.
SUTHERLAND => I'll come there.  Hold on, Nicholas, I have another call.  Tell me where you are.
NICHOLAS => We have to get out of here.
NICHOLAS => How did they get to him?  Why didn't you tell me?
CHRISTINE => Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
NICHOLAS => What... what do you mean?
CHRISTINE => It's out of your hands.
CHRISTINE => Cellular calls can be intercepted, you know.
CHRISTINE =>  All those calls you made, to B of A, France, Switzerland... you were talking to my people.  You filled the blanks.  Access codes, passwords, stuff even your lawyer didn't have -- but we have it now.
CHRISTINE => It's over, Nicholas.  Goodbye.
NICHOLAS => Where am I?  What is this place?
NICHOLAS => Officer... officer...
NICHOLAS => Do you speak English?  I'm an American.
NICHOLAS => Listen... they took my wallet...  American.  I am an American citizen.
NICHOLAS => No, you don't understand, I'm an American...
NICHOLAS => ... fuck...
NICHOLAS =>  The embassy?  Please... the American embassy, do you know it?
NICHOLAS => Excuse me... Buenos Diaz, I'm looking for the United States embassy.  U.S. embassy, please... pour favor?
NICHOLAS => Thank you.  Thank you, sir.
COUNSELOR => Please, sit...
NICHOLAS => Mister...  Mister Patterson.  Some things have happened... it's important that I...
COUNSELOR => No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
NICHOLAS => Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
COUNSELOR =>  It always is.
NICHOLAS => What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
COUNSELOR => Robbed?
NICHOLAS => Yes.
COUNSELOR => Have you gone to the police?
NICHOLAS => I don't speak Spanish.  All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
COUNSELOR => We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
NICHOLAS => Yes.
COUNSELOR => And, they didn't take that watch?
COUNSELOR => How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
NICHOLAS => Yes, very lucky.
NICHOLAS => Fifty?  Do you know...  It's a Rolex.  It's gold.  Not gold colored, actual gold.
NICHOLAS => You see, all you had to do was get in the ballpark.  Yes, fifty-five... si, senorita.
NiCHOLAS => Pardon me...
NICHOLAS => Excuse me, please, if I could have your attention...
NICHOLAS => Thank you.  If anyone's heading to San Francisco, I need a ride.
NICHOLAS => There's...  There's all the money I've got left in it for you... eighteen dollars and seventy-nine cents...
NICHOLAS =>  Ilsa.
NICHOLAS => I'm here to see Conrad Van Orton. Ring his room.
DESK CLERK => One moment, please...
NICHOLAS => What's the trouble?
MANAGER => You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
NICHOLAS => Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
MANAGER =>  Your brother.  Will you come with me?
NICHOLAS => What's this about?
MANAGER => It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
NICHOLAS => Where's my brother?
MANAGER => There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
NICHOLAS => His behavior... ?
MANAGER => He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
NICHOLAS => Look, where is he?!
MANAGER => There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
MANAGER => It's a hospital in Napa.  I'm terribly sorry.  If you'd have been here, you'd have seen, there was nothing else to do.
NICHOLAS => I need your car, Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH => What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
NICHOLAS => I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
ELIZABETH => Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
NICHOLAS => You're the only person I can trust. Everyone else...  If Sam Sutherland calls, don't tell him you saw me.  Lie to him.  And, whatever you hear, whatever anyone tells you when this is over...
PALE WAITRESS =>  There we go... coffee and English muffin... water...  So, if there's anything...
NICHOLAS => This is open.  Someone opened it.
PALE WAITRESS => Yes sir, I...
NICHOLAS => I can't have this open.  I'd like another unopened.  And I don't want ice.  I need a glass without ice.
ELIZABETH => Nick, talk to me.  You're scaring me. I don't even know what you're saying.
NICHOLAS => I'm sorry, Liz... I don't mean to.
NICHOLAS => The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
ELIZABETH => There's nothing to forgive.
NICHOLAS => It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
ELIZABETH => Of course, Nick...
NICHOLAS => No... no!
NICHOLAS =>  You fucking bastard!
NICHOLAS =>  How did you find me here?!
FEINGOLD =>  Honey, my head is killing me!
WIFE =>  Did you take anything, sweetie?
FEINGOLD =>  I took aspirin, but it's not working!
WIFE =>  Try Ambutol, you silly goose.  It's stronger than aspirin and...
NICHOLAS => He... he's an actor...
FEINGOLD => Thanks to Ambutol, I've got my head back together.
NICHOLAS => It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
ELIZABETH =>  Yes.
NICHOLAS => I'll explain someday.
ELIZABETH => I hope.
NICHOLAS => Can I borrow your Yellow Pages... ?
NICHOLAS => Thanks.
NICHOLAS => Tung Hoy.  Tung Hoy... best in Chinatown.
MALE VOICE => Get out of the car, fucker...
TEEN THUG => Open the door and climb out.  Leave it running.
NICHOLAS => You're making a mistake...
TEEN THUG => Get out of the car.
NICHOLAS => You don't understand...
TEEN THUG => Get out of the car, motherfucker! Get out of the car... !
NICHOLAS => You have no idea how fragile I am right now.
NICHOLAS => He's an actor.  He does television commercials...
CHINESE WOMAN => Do you know how many customers we have?  Hundreds.  Thousands.
NICHOLAS => I know he orders from you.  He had his food delivered to Montgomery Street.  Fifteen-thirty-three...
NICHOLAS => Is there anyone else I could ask? Maybe they'll remem...
NICHOLAS =>  ... I know it's short notice Mrs. Fisher, but we were hoping your husband could audition today.  He's perfect for the part...
MRS FISHER =>  Oh, this will break his heart...
NICHOLAS => Is there any way we can get in touch with him?
MRS FISHER => His beeper's here on the table.  He took the kids to the zoo.
NICHOLAS => The zoo.  How sweet.  Which zoo?
NICHOLAS => Bill Fisher, I love your work...
FEINGOLD => Okay, please.. I got my kids...
NICHOLAS => Get rid of them.
FEINGOLD => Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
FEINGOLD => Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
NICHOLAS => I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
FEINGOLD => Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
FEINGOLD => Goddamnit, why do they do that?
NICHOLAS =>  How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
FEINGOLD => They own the whole building.  They just move from floor to floor.
NICHOLAS => They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
FEINGOLD => No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
NICHOLAS => Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
FEINGOLD => What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
NICHOLAS => You don't seem to understand.  Right now -- I'm dangerous.
FEINGOLD => We're here.
NICHOLAS => Drive in.
FEINGOLD => What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
NICHOLAS =>  I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
FEINGOLD =>  He's eyeing us like Tiffany Towers.
NICHOLAS => Just go.  Park where he can't see.
C.R.S. GUARD => You're not allowed to be here.
FEINGOLD => No, they called me back... I have a fitting...
NICHOLAS => Give me the gun.
FEINGOLD => You don't need me...
NICHOLAS => Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
NICHOLAS => What floor?
C.R.S. GUARD => Fourteen.  But this elevator ain't gonna get you there, college boy.
C.R.S. GUARD => You'll never get away with this. These people will fuck you up.
C.R.S. GUARD => You're fucked.  You're both...
NICHOLAS => Where?
FEINGOLD => I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
NICHOLAS => Where'd you pick up your checks?
FEINGOLD => It was a different floor then...
NICHOLAS => Guess!
FEINGOLD => Like, this way... sort of...
CHRISTINE => Oh, fuck...
CHRISTINE => What are you doing here?
NICHOLAS => I'm back from the dead.
CHRISTINE => Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
NICHOLAS => You're coming with me!
MALE VOICE => Everybody down!
NICHOLAS => Get us out of here...
CHRISTINE => Nicholas...
NICHOLAS => Get us out!
NICHOLAS => Move, move, move!
CHRISTINE => What do you think you're doing?
NICHOLAS => You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
CHRISTINE => How deluded can you be?  There's no why...
NICHOLAS => Who's responsible?!
CHRISTINE => It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
NICHOLAS => You call them...
CHRISTINE => It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
NICHOLAS => Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
CHRISTINE => They won't...
NICHOLAS => They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
CHRISTINE => I'm telling you... they'll let me die first.  You're not in a position to threaten them.  You're trapped. You're the one who...
CHRISTINE => ... wait a minute...
CHRISTINE => Where'd you get that... ?
NICHOLAS => ... what... ?
CHRISTINE => That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
NICHOLAS => What the fuck are you... ?
CHRISTINE => Where'd you get that gun?
NICHOLAS => It's mine...
CHRISTINE => We searched the house.
NICHOLAS => Guess you missed it.
CHRISTINE =>  Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
CHRISTINE =>  He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a real gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
NICHOLAS => What are you doing?
CHRISTINE => Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
NICHOLAS => Fuck you.
CHRISTINE => Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
NICHOLAS => Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
CHRISTINE => No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
NICHOLAS => I saw them kill him!
CHRISTINE => What did you really see?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
NICHOLAS => Stop talking to them!
CHRISTINE => Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
NICHOLAS => Stop talking...
CHRISTINE => Nicholas...
NICHOLAS => Shut up!
CHRISTINE => Let me show you...
NICHOLAS => No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
CHRISTINE => You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
CHRISTINE => Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
NICHOLAS => That's not true...
CHRISTINE => It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
NICHOLAS => No...
CHRISTINE => Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
NICHOLAS => Stop it!
CHRISTINE => Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
NICHOLAS => Don't move, you bitch... !
CHRISTINE =>  I have to show you...
NICHOLAS => No!
MALE VOICE =>  ... Take him down!  Take him down...
CHRISTINE =>  He's got a gun!
CHRISTINE => Don't!
NICHOLAS => Connie...
FEINGOLD => Jesus... you shot him... !  Someone call an ambulance!
FEINGOLD => Oh, God... oh, God...
FEINGOLD => He's dead... he's dead... !  You killed him!
CHRISTINE =>  Why?!  I told you... I told you.  Why didn't you listen?
FEINGOLD => We're going to jail.  We're all going to jail for the rest of our lives...
FEINGOLD =>  We thought you knew!  How could you let this get so out of hand?
CHRISTINE => Why wouldn't you listen to me?  What is wrong with you?  You killed your own brother!
VARIOUS VOICES => ... let's go! ... make sure he's alright... see if he's okay...
CONRAD => Happy Birthday, Nickie.  Happy fucking Birthday...
NICHOLAS => Get... get off.  Get off me!! You... you...
CONRAD => Ladies and gentlemen...  My big brother... Nicholas Van Orton! He had it all, and now he has it all back!
ILSA => I hope we'll be seeing more of you.
CONRAD => Count on it.
ILSA => Goodnight.  See you home.
NICHOLAS => Goodnight.  Where was she?
CONRAD => In a hotel.  Ordering room service and watching pay-per-view.  She was a real sport.
BUSINESSMAN 1 => Hey, congratulations!  You did great... really kicked ass...
HEAVY MAN => Amazing, just wanted to tell you...
NICHOLAS =>  You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
CONRAD => Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
MAN =>  Mister Van Orton... ?
ACCOUNTANT => Conrad Van Orton.
CONRAD => Yeah... ?
ELIZABETH => We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
NICHOLAS => You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
ELIZABETH => Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
NICHOLAS => I'll call.  I really will.
ELIZABETH => I know.
NICHOLAS => Bye guys.
SUTHERLAND => Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the finest mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
NICHOLAS => You warm my heart.
NICHOLAS => What?
CONRAD => This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
NICHOLAS => Really?
CONRAD =>  Yeah.
NICHOLAS => Split it?
CONRAD => Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
NICHOLAS =>  Where's Christine?  The waitress.
CONRAD => Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
NICHOLAS => Did she?
NICHOLAS => Excuse me... Christine... !
NICHOLAS => Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
CHRISTINE => That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
NICHOLAS => I didn't know what else to call you.
CHRISTINE => Claire.
NICHOLAS => Claire.  Pleased to meet you.
CHRISTINE => I have to get to the airport...
NICHOLAS => Where are you going in such a hurry?
CHRISTINE => There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
NICHOLAS => What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
CHRISTINE =>  Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
NICHOLAS => I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
CHRISTINE => Like what... my favorite color... ?
NICHOLAS => Like... where are you from?
CHRISTINE => Originally, Connecticut.
NICHOLAS => Big family... small?
CHRISTINE => One brother, one sister.
NICHOLAS => Studied acting, I assume?
CHRISTINE => Julliard, yeah.
NICHOLAS => Single?
CHRISTINE => Yes.
NICHOLAS => Boyfriend?
CHRISTINE => No.
NICHOLAS => Underwear?
CHRISTINE => Always.
NICHOLAS => I could learn to live with that.
NICHOLAS => See how much I've learned already. Imagine how much more I could learn if you let me keep you company to the airport.
