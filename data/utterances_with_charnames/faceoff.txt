GEOFFREY => Thank goodness, a human being.
GEOFFREY => [I'm terribly sorry, but I feel like Icarus in the labyrinth.  Where the devil is Parking Level Red-14B?]
DISPATCHER => Attention all units -- 211 at Pier 39.  Suspect is a white male, 30's, 6 feet with specs, armed and very dangerous.  Heading south on Van Ness in a blue Ford sedan.  Watch for this one, fellas -- he's looney toons.
GEOFFREY => Another day, another - cop?
GEOFFREY => You're making a ghastly mistake!  I haven't been to Fisherman's Wharf,  I don't even like fish.
GEOFFREY => Check my papers -- I'm with the English consulate -- I've got diplomatic immunity -- and you've - got - no - right!
GEOFFREY => Hello!  Sorry I'm late, but there's been a bit of a muddle.  I'm on the ninth floor of the bloody Fillmore police station.  Could you come and "bail me out" or whatever they call it?  There's a good chap.
CLERK => -- I do have something on the 26th floor facing west -- but there's no view.
POLLUX => Yes -- there is.
BRYCE => If this guy took a shit off the London Bridge -- we'll know about it in two seconds.
TRAINEE => This guy?  I bet he never even said the word shit.
DR. GARDNER => How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
ARCHER => Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
DR. GARDNER => You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
ARCHER => I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
DR. GARDNER => You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
ARCHER => One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
DR. GARDNER => I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
ARCHER => I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
DR. GARDNER => You said it, Jon, not me.
DR. GARDNER => You put yourself in constant jeopardy so you don't have to face yourself.  But what will you do when the job is over -- and there's no place left to hide?
DR. GARDNER => I am not your secretary. When you're in here --
ARCHER =>  Jon Archer.
ARCHER => I'll be right there, Sergeant.  Don't talk to him, don't listen to him, and for God's sake -- don't go near him ...
GEOFFREY => Excuse me, Officer.  May I have a private word with you? (Morris puts Dinah down and approaches) I just wanted to say ... (drops English accent and speaks in his natural American idiom) Thanks for being one dumb fuck.
LUNT => Number 6 -- the cue-ball.
LARS => 6 is tagged.
POLLUX => Hurry ...
POLLUX => It's my brother ...
POLLUX => Castor -- !
CASTOR => Go on -- GO!
ARCHER => You won't be using this trick on me again.
ARCHER => Turn around.
CASTOR => Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
ARCHER => And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
CASTOR => What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
ARCHER => You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
CASTOR => What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
ARCHER => Mention my family once more and you're dead.
CASTOR => You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
ARCHER => You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
CASTOR => Don't count on it.
TITO => Tell me he didn't get away again ...
LAZARRO => Jon --!
LAZARRO => Fine work, Jon.
ARCHER => Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
LAZARRO => I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
ARCHER =>  ... Thanks.
LAZARRO => Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
ARCHER => Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
REPORTER => Hey, Archer, what's going on?  How about a statement?
LAZARRO => Jon -- bad press means bad publicity means budget cuts.  Just have your report on my desk by noon.
TITO => Go home, Jon.  Tell Eve ...
ARCHER => Hi ...  Where's Jamie?
EVE => She complimented her "D" in physics with an "F" in grad theft auto ...
ARCHER => Stealing a police car from a car wash!  Are you out of your mind?
JAMIE => That's right.  Don't even ask me what happened.
ARCHER => Okay.  What happened?
JAMIE => Like you'd ever believe me over a fucking cop!
EVE => Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
ARCHER => Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
EVE => She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
ARCHER => Is that what you think?
EVE => Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
ARCHER => We need to talk.
EVE => I'm late for surgery.
ARCHER => It's important.
EVE => So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
EVE => Jon -- what is it?
EVE => Is it -- him?  You got him?
EVE => It's over, Jon?  It's really over?
ARCHER => I'll make it up to you and Jamie.  I'll put in for a desk job.  This time, I mean it.
ARCHER => Much appreciated.  Now let's get back to work, okay?
WANDA =>  Is that stick ever gonna fall out of his ass?
KIMBERLY =>  The CIA sent this over. What should I do with it?
ARCHER => Send it back and tell them to stop wasting the taxpayers' money.  And Miss Brewster --
KIMBERLY => Yes, Commander?
ARCHER => It's against the law to smoke in a federal building.
KIMBERLY => Three years -- and he still calls me "Miss Brewster."
ARCHER => How's Loomis?
TITO => Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
ARCHER => Go on.
TITO => Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
TITO => ... And I found this -- at his brother's flat ...
TITO => Porcelain casing ... thermal neutron cloak ... I didn't recognize the payload.
ARCHER => Some kind of designer toxin. (moving into the core then inspecting it) Probably biological. Definitely airborne.
ARCHER => "Worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs."
ARCHER => Castor's sociopathic, but not suicidal.  He wouldn't handle anything this unstable without ...
ARCHER => -- Here.  A fail-safe -- in case the bomb goes critical while being installed.  Find out how it works. And call Lazarro -- tell her I'm on my way up.
POLLUX =>  -- That bomb was just a crossword puzzle to me ... a mental exercise.  I never built it ...
ARCHER => He's lying.
LAZARRO => Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
ARCHER => I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
LAZARRO => What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
ARCHER => It isn't a hunch and Castor doesn't bluff. It's going to happen ...
TITO => We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
ARCHER => He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
TITO => I'll be damned.  Loomis ...
ARCHER => Which ear was it?
TITO => The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
HOAG => This informant marked himself for death by testifying against a drug cartel, so he was sent to me for a little makeover.
HOAG => A rhinoplasty here, a mentoplasty there ...
HOAG => Blepharoplasty, otoplasty ... Everywhere a plasty, plasty.
HOAG => Physical augmentation, vocal enhancement implants -- More snitches have disappeared in here than in San Francisco Bay.  Of course, it's easy to make someone look like no one ... But I'm always tinkering with other methods.
HOAG => Using a morpho-genetic template, the sub-structure can be molded to the exact shape of one man's skull; the outside -- exactly like another's. (admires his own image -- now on the Informant) Vast improvement, isn't it?
ARCHER => So it is possible?
HOAG => To temporarily borrow another man's face?  Oh, yes.  I can think of only one reason why it's never been done --  -- no one's ever asked.
ARCHER => But will you do it?
HOAG => Without approval -- totally off the books as you say? Commander, your proposal would cost me my job and get me banished from every respectable medical society in the world.  That's why I like it. But can you find a volunteer in time?
ARCHER => -- I already have.
EVE => ... I was dreaming ...
ARCHER => Something good?
EVE => We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
ARCHER => Must've been after we got engaged.
EVE => Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
ARCHER => So you had a nightmare.
EVE => Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
ARCHER => Were you there to catch me?
EVE => No.
ARCHER => How come?
EVE => I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
EVE => It's all right, Jon.
ARCHER => Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
EVE => And you wouldn't be.
EVE => Things will get better now that you're home. Everything will be better now that ... that man is finally out of our lives.
ARCHER => Eve ...
ARCHER => ... If I had to do something to find some closure ... I should do it, shouldn't I? ... No matter how crazy?
EVE => What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
ARCHER => One last time.  It's important ...
EVE => You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
ARCHER => I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
EVE => You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
ARCHER => Am I crazy, Matty?
ARCHER => Sasha Plummer, 28, single, mother of one.  Met Castor Troy in Berkeley at a Pearl Jam reunion.  Felony convictions: two counts, drug running. She has a tattoo of a 1956 Buick on her right ankle.
TITO => Castor himself didn't know half this crap, and it was his life.  What do you want with the prison lay-out? That place is so tight, you couldn't squeeze a fart out of there.
ARCHER => Dietrich Hassler.  45. Biochemist.  Dismissed from the FDA on charges of ...
TITO => Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
ARCHER => She doesn't know -- and she never will.
TITO => You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
ARCHER => Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
TITO => Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
DR. HOAG => Let's walk through it, Commander.  Your blood types are different, but surgically compatible.  The height difference is negligible -- within 1/2 an inch.  The feet are close enough.  Penis size, flaccid, essentially the same.  Substantial.
DR. HOAG => Eye color will be handled with a retinal dye.  Body hair -- with micro-grafts. Teeth, a little cosmetic bonding.  The tattoos will be -- tattooed.  Fingerprints -- we'll use an organic skin mold and a little Crazy Glue.
ARCHER => Kid's stuff.
DR. HOAG => Abdominoplasty, Commander? It's on the house.
ARCHER => Abdomino -- what?
DR. HOAG => A tummy tuck.
ARCHER => Do it.
DR. HOAG => You realize, Commander -- this has to go.
DR. HOAG => Let's see if I missed anything before I get my hands really dirty.
DR. HOAG => Here we go, Commander. Through the Looking Glass ...
DR. HOAG => -- initial incision will be made above the ear, extending down behind the left earlobe, then back up into the hairline.
DR. HOAG => Make sure you get everything -- I'll need to study the tape before reverse surgery.
DR. HOAG => Vault it.
DR. HOAG => Come on -- the other one!
ARCHER => It's me, Tito.  It's Jon.
ARCHER => It worked ...  Except for this.
DR. HOAG => Yes -- the voice.
DR. HOAG => I implanted a micro-chip onto your larynx -- a prototype developed for throat cancer survivors.
DR. HOAG => As your chords adjust, the scratchiness will pass.
TITO => Now what?
ARCHER => Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
TITO => This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
ARCHER => Just make sure you're there.  On time.
TITO => Watch this hard-case -- he'll bite your nuts off if he gets the chance!
ARCHER => Do I get a meal on this flight?
LOOMIS => What a week for Commander Archer to go on vacation. Maybe we should let him know.
WANDA => Forget it.  He left strict orders not to be tracked down.
BUZZ => He'll shit when he finds out Castor pulled through.
WANDA => If he shits at all.
BUZZ => Probably doesn't.
VOICE => Put on the boots
VOICE => Don't sniff 'em, you perv.  Just put 'em on.
ARCHER => They're too tight.
WALTON => So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
WALTON => You are now an inmate of the world's toughest prison.  In here -- you are no one.  You own nothing.  When I say your ass belongs to me -- I mean it.  Bend over.
WALTON => The entire prison's one big magnetic field.  The boots'll tell us where you are -- every second of the day.  Now WALK.
WALTON => I've got fifty bucks says you're dead by dinner. Don't disappoint me.
LITTLE MAN => Hey, Castor -- remember me?
ARCHER => Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
WAXY => They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
ARCHER => Do I look wasted -- asshole?
WAXY =>  You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
ARCHER => -- Hit the spot.
DEPUTY => I've got bio-rhythm jumps -- two -- at the eatery.
SECURITY CHIEF => Lock 'em down.
ARCHER => What?  He started it!
ARCHER => When I get out of here --
WALTON => You'll what?
ARCHER => I'm going to have you fired.
WALTON => That's two strikes, Dobbs. One more -- you know where you're going.
WALTON => Back to your "suites," -- or no dinner.
ARCHER => Hey, bro ...
POLLUX => You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
ARCHER => They haven't found it yet -- Listen, Pollux ...
WALTON => Shut up!
CASTOR => Lars ... it's me ... well, believe it!  Somewhere in fucking Berkeley ...  The "Hoag Institute."  Just get the fuck over here.  And bring me a double cappuccino, 'cause Jesus, do I have the mother of all hangovers ... What? ... Yeah, low-fat.
HOAG => Who are you?  What do you want?
CASTOR => I want my face.
ARCHER => Pollux ...
POLLUX => Shut up.
POLLUX => There it goes again -- a bearded bellbird!
ARCHER => So?
POLLUX => So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
POLLUX => What's gotten into you?
ARCHER => What do you mean?
POLLUX => You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
ARCHER => I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
POLLUX => Let me have a look.
ARCHER => Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
POLLUX => You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
ARCHER => I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
POLLUX => A few blanks?  Like what?
ARCHER => Like ...
ARCHER => ... I know I got this on my tenth birthday.  But I can't remember why.
POLLUX => Come on ... that was the wort day of our lives!
ARCHER => Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
POLLUX => Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
POLLUX => Remember what you swore to me at the funeral?
ARCHER => Uh -- to kill the doctors?
POLLUX => After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
ARCHER => And I bet I've kept that promise ...
POLLUX => Only one you've never broken.
ARCHER => Fuck the past.  We've got the future to look forward to.
ARCHER => We still have Saturday night.
POLLUX => No shit.  Man, that was going to be one big pay day.
POLLUX => Five million bucks -- and now the fucking Taiwanese get to keep it all.
ARCHER => That's not the worst part.
POLLUX => What's worse than losing five million bucks?
ARCHER => Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.  Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.
POLLUX => Yeah -- well ... the new Transamerica Tower will have to do ...
ARCHER => Thanks, Pollux.
POLLUX => For what?
ARCHER => For being one helluva guy.
POLLUX => "Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
WALTON => Somebody wants to see you.
IMPOSTOR => What's the matter?  Don't you like the new me?
ARCHER => -- Castor?
CASTOR => Not anymore.
ARCHER => It can't be.  It's impossible.
CASTOR => I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was "titanically remote."  Who knows?  Maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out.  Or maybe God really is on my side after all.  By the way, I know you don't get the papers in here.
CASTOR => Terrible tragedy.  Hoag was such a genius -- but selfish with his artistry.  I actually had to torture his wife to convince him to perform the same surgery on me.
ARCHER => You killed them?
CASTOR => Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
ARCHER => What are you going to do, Castor?
CASTOR => Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
ARCHER => What are you going to do!
CASTOR => You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean "make love to."
ARCHER => That's not me!  That's not me!
WALTON => Sorry, Commander.
CASTOR => It's quite all right. You never know what to expect from a psychopathic criminal.
WALTON => You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
ARCHER => Pollux is -- what?
WALTON => Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
ARCHER => Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
WALTON => Or what?  You'll have me fired?
TITO => Jon?  What the hell happened?
CASTOR => You're a secret agent -- you tell me.
TITO => Christ, you're in a mood.  Okay -- you had to pull out.  Pollux wasn't fooled for a minute.
TITO => That's what happened, right?
CASTOR => Dead right.  Now -- how about a beer for me?
TITO => You ... sure.  Hang on -- if Hoag's dead, how'd you switch back?  And ...  ... who pulled you out?
CASTOR => Nobody.
CASTOR => I'll take that beer now.
CASTOR =>  Jesus, what a life.
CASTOR => Hi, uh -- Eve.  Can you believe I drove right by the house?
EVE => What happened to your big "assignment"?
CASTOR => What do you know about it?
EVE => As much as ever.  Nothing.
CASTOR =>  It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
EVE => The hospital.
CASTOR => The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
EVE => Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
CASTOR => Have fun at work.
EVE => What is with you tonight?
CASTOR => Don't I usually kiss my wife?
EVE => No.
CASTOR => What a dump.
CASTOR => He hasn't done her in two months?  What a loser ...  There's gotta be one cigarette in this hole.
JAMIE => -- You're lying, Karl, I E-mailed you three times --  Hang on a sec ...
JAMIE => I'll call you back.  You're not respecting my boundaries.
CASTOR => Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
JAMIE => Janie?
CASTOR => I don't think you heard me ... Jamie ... You have something I want ...
JAMIE => Clarissa left those here.
CASTOR =>  I won't tell mom if you don't.
JAMIE => When did you start smoking?
CASTOR => You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
POLLUX => You merciless bastard!
CASTOR => Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
POLLUX => I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
CASTOR => You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
POLLUX => You can't be serious --
POLLUX => It's the perfect cover. You'll have the highest security clearances, access to everything and everyone, a private army at your disposal! If information is power --
CASTOR => -- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
POLLUX => No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
CASTOR => Trust me.  You're gonna love it ...
WALTON => A special privilege today -- TV -- courtesy of Castor Troy.
REPORTER => A biological bomb was discovered this morning in the climate control system of the Transamerica-Two Tower in San Francisco.  A group of Japan's leading geneticists were the target ...
REPORTER => NSA Special Agent Jon Archer -- who found the device -- risked his life to diffuse it only moments before it was set to explode.  We go live to the scene where the media-shy Archer is holding his first press conference --
REPORTER => Commander Archer -- who do you think planted it?
CASTOR => That's classified.  But if he's listening I have a message for him:  Nice try.  Now you know who's really in charge.
CASTOR => How's the wife -- Ed?
ED =>  Fine, Commander.
CASTOR => Don't you guys watch TV? Where's the parade?
CASTOR => -- Buzz, uh -- Wanda, Loomis ... all of you, thanks from the bottom of my black heart.
WANDA => Stop the presses -- Jon Archer found a personality ...
KIMBERLY => Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
CASTOR => Well, I saw you -- Kim.
KIMBERLY => Kim?
CASTOR => That's your name, isn't it?
KIMBERLY => You always call me Miss Brewster.
CASTOR => Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
KIMBERLY => You've got someone in your office.
CASTOR => Get rid of them.
KIMBERLY => The Admiral?
LAZARRO => Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
CASTOR => Normally, I would.  But today ...
CASTOR => To the future, Admiral. Yours -- and mine.
LAZARRO =>  Practicing our executive signature, are we?
LAZARRO => If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were finally kissing my butt ... and I bet I know why.
CASTOR => You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
LAZARRO => You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
CASTOR => Just following your example.
LAZARRO => D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
CASTOR => What's that?
LAZARRO => Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
CASTOR => I had doubts too.  I always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain. But something happened ...
CASTOR => I came back from a mission and found strangers in my house. Only they weren't strangers, they were my wife and child.  Five years my life was on hold. While I chased the elusive, but brilliant, Castor Troy.  I've earned the right to start living again.  So when I look at this --  I don't see a ball-and-chain. I see an anchor -- for me and my family.
LAZARRO => You'd have to start immediately.
CASTOR => Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
LAZARRO => Jon, you're starting to remind me -- of me.  Congratulations.
CASTOR => Jon -- you'd be so proud ...
CASTOR => Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
JAMIE => Like you know anything about it.
CASTOR => Now square your shoulders to the goddamn basket.
EVE => Where are you going?
JAMIE => Chinatown.
EVE => On a school night?
JAMIE => Dad said it was OK.  Have fun.
CASTOR => Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
EVE => -- I've got to study.
CASTOR => I can't believe you forgot. Eve -- it's Date Night.
EVE => Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
CASTOR => They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
EVE => I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
CASTOR => Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
EVE => You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law.  Remember what my brother called you?
CASTOR => Who could forget?  I was so young and clumsy then --
CASTOR => Some things never change.
EVE => So -- how long will you be gone this time?
CASTOR => Gone?
EVE => Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
CASTOR => I'm not going anywhere.
EVE => You always say that -- then you leave.
CASTOR => Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
CASTOR => -- brown eyes.
CASTOR => I wanted it to be just right ... when I told you about my promotion.
EVE => -- what?
CASTOR => I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
EVE => ... That's great.
CASTOR => So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
EVE => You're wearing your suit --
CASTOR => Call me spontaneous.
CASTOR => ... I feel like I'm having you for the first time ...
ARCHER => Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
WAXY => Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
ARCHER => You mean if I get sick?
WAXY => They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
WAXY => -- Toughest bastard I ever saw -- after you, of course -- now he's a fucking drool case.
ARCHER => What did he do?
WAXY => He hit a guard.
GUARD => Looking for trouble, Castor?
ARCHER => Actually ... yes.
MED-TECH => Get a mop, he puked all over the place.
MED-TECH =>  -- next time, bring them in BEFORE dinner ...
MED-TECH => Oh happy day -- Castor Troy. Too bad Jon Archer isn't here to see this ...
WALTON => Bite hard, scumbag, 'cause you'll be gumming baby food from here on out.
MED-TECH => Get his boots, Sergeant.
SECURITY BOX => Print unreadable.
SECURITY BOX => Confirmed:  Archer, Commander Jonathan T.  Please enter classified security code.
ARCHER => Come on, Vixen ... Donner ... Blixen ...
WALTON => Damn, he's good.
WALTON => South, North, East, West. You've got no where to go.
WALTON => What's he doing?
ARCHER => What - am - I - doing?
CASTOR =>  Use it or lose it, Jon.
EVE => Last night, I thought -- this isn't my husband.
EVE => Obviously, I was wrong.
CASTOR => What's on your mind?
EVE => Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
CASTOR => I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
EVE => The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
CASTOR => Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
EVE => I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
CASTOR => Great.
EVE => Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
CASTOR => Oh, that Karl.
EVE => Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
CASTOR => I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
EVE => Jon -- this is hardly the time or place.
EVE => Happy birthday, Matty. Every day we think of you. You're part of everything we are and everything we do ...  I wish you could know the lifetime of joy and happiness you brought us.
EVE => He took our baby, Jon. He took our little boy.
CASTOR => Stop crying ... stop crying ... stop ...
CASTOR => How's our star witness?
AGENT => Spilling his guts.  Obviously his guilty conscience has finally caught up with him.
CASTOR => Obviously.
POLLUX => Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
CASTOR => You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
POLLUX => Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
CASTOR => Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
POLLUX => I'm just having some fun.
CASTOR => There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
POLLUX => Eight pocket stingers ... seven piper uzis ... six cobra carbines ...  five - net - launch-ers ...
CASTOR =>  Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
CASTOR => As the new chief of covert operations, I've planned a little get-together with the Pacific Rim station chiefs.  Friday night.
POLLUX => And when they "get-together" -- what happens?
CASTOR => We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
POLLUX => Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
CASTOR => All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
POLLUX => Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
CASTOR => You'll need to recultivate that virus.
POLLUX => No problem.
WANDA => Commander!
WANDA => You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
CASTOR => What happened?
WANDA => Castor's escaped!
CASTOR => Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
BUZZ => SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
CASTOR => Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
CASTOR => Have the twins watch my "wife."  He'll try to get to her.
POLLUX => What about me?
CASTOR => A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
POLLUX => Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
CASTOR => Take my Glock.  It's a jungle out there.
ARCHER => Collect call to Evelyn Archer at 392-0888.
OPERATOR => Who's placing the call, please?
ARCHER => -- Her husband.
ARCHER => Goddamn it.
EVE => Jon?  Hello?
EVE => Is someone there?
ARCHER => Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
LARS =>  -- Got him.
EVE => Who is this?
ARCHER => Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
EVE => Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
ARCHER => Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
EVE => Whoever you are, don't call again.
ARCHER => Don't hang up ...
PROCTOR => Doctor, we're waiting ...
ARCHER => No, Jon ... think like Castor. Where would he go ... who would he turn to?
SASHA => Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
ARCHER => Yeah -- me.
SASHA => Jesus Christ, Castor.
ARCHER => Drive.
SASHA => The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.
ARCHER => Just get out of here -- please.  I -- I'll ...
SASHA => Damn it, Caz.
CASTOR => -- you don't have to rat out anybody ... nothing changes except now you've got the blessing -- and protection -- of the NSA ...  [No.  Santiago's spoken for ... you can have Panama City or Acapulco.  Take Acapulco, the food's better.]
CASTOR => Bueno ... I'll be in touch.
JAMIE => No ... no, please.  My father -- he's got a gun -- he'll -- he'll --
KARL => That wimp won't do shit.  Anyway, you said he's never home --
CASTOR => Who are you to call Jon Archer a wimp?
CASTOR => You dickless suburban puke, get out of here before I eat your fucking spleen.
CASTOR => What are you -- stupid?
JAMIE => You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
CASTOR => Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
JAMIE => You mean like ... condoms?
CASTOR => I mean like protection.
JAMIE => For me?
CASTOR => -- Now, uh, brush your bed and go to teeth -- it's a school night.
CASTOR => Jesus, Jon, how did you deal with this family shit?
CASTOR => Jon Archer.  Where is he?
POLLUX =>  -- Some condo complex on Telegraph Hill.  I played a hunch he might contact an old friend of yours ...
ARCHER => Where am I?
SASHA => My place.
ARCHER => You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
SASHA => Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
ARCHER => I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
SASHA => Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
ARCHER => I'm not the same person you remember.
SASHA => Take the rest of those filthy things off. I'll be right back.
SASHA =>  You're still dressed.
SASHA => You really have changed, haven't you?
ARCHER => More than you'll ever know.
ARCHER => -- Can we just talk?
SASHA =>  Talk?  The only talk I ever heard from you was "take it off," "sit on it," "I'll see you around."
ARCHER => Perfect fit.
SASHA => Should be.  It's yours.
ARCHER => Nice-looking kid.
SASHA => Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
CASTOR =>  We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
BUZZ => What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
CASTOR => I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. -- And get the word out -- shoot to kill.
BUZZ => You heard the Commander -- let's saddle up!
SASHA => Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
ARCHER => How old is he?
SASHA => Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you.
ARCHER => Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
SASHA => You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
ARCHER => In one awful moment -- he could be dead.
ARCHER => He's not my son.
SASHA => Yes, he is.  Caz --
ARCHER => Get down!  GET DOWN!
CASTOR => Split up.  I want to know the second he's spotted.
SASHA => Thank you, Caz ...
ARCHER => Stay away from my family!
CASTOR => Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
POLLUX => Peek-a-boo, dumb fuck.
POLLUX => Remember me?  Your big brother?
CASTOR => Wait for a better shot.
POLLUX => You tricked me into telling you shit I never told anyone. Now take it to your grave.
CASTOR => Pollux ... Pollux!
CASTOR =>  Get a medic -- now! Hang on, Pollux ...
LOOMIS => Forget him, sir.  It's only Pollux Troy ...
WANDA => What happened?
CASTOR => What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
DIETRICH => Mother nature at her finest. One part per trillion of this stuff will kill you faster than a mailman with a grudge.
ARCHER => And this thing can grow it?
DIETRICH => Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
ARCHER => Why would he need more?
DIETRICH => He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
ARCHER =>  Or reactivated the first one.
DIETRICH => Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
LAZARRO => I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
CASTOR => What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
LAZARRO => I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
CASTOR => No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
LAZARRO => Okay, then.  I leave it in your able hands.
CASTOR => My able hands.
CASTOR => For you, bro.
COP => Crap, I wanted hot wax.
DISPATCHER => All units.  I have a confirmed code zero-zero priority alert. Proceed at once to Army Street Terminal.  That's Army at Third.
WANDA => Commander, what are you doing here?
CASTOR => Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
WANDA => Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
CASTOR => What?
WANDA => It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
CASTOR => Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
ARCHER => Eve ...
ARCHER => I'm not going to hurt you. Just don't scream, okay?  Okay?
EVE => I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
ARCHER => -- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
ARCHER => This time you're going to listen.  Last week -- we were in bed -- we had a fight after you touched my scar. I told you I had to go away.  My assignment -- Jon Archer's assignment -- was to enter a federal prison as Castor Troy.
EVE => How did he expect to do that?
ARCHER => An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
COPS => Dr. Archer, are you okay?
ARCHER => If you need hard evidence, get it.  Your husband's blood type is O negative. Castor's is AB.
ARCHER => Remember the parachute dream?  I'm falling, Eve, and I need your help ...
CASTOR => Hey -- keep off the lawn.
CASTOR => What are you doing?
EVE => -- Studying.
EVE => You scared me half to death.
CASTOR => Baby, I'm working on some very sensitive documents here.  If you don't mind -- use the laptop.
CASTOR => What's wrong?
EVE => Nothing.
CASTOR => I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
EVE => -- Yes.
CASTOR => Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
CASTOR => I read your diary.  I've been trying to change -- I'm trying to be the man you want me to be.
CASTOR => You forgive me, don't you?
EVE => -- Of course I do.
EVE => Please be O-neg.  Please ...
ARCHER => Thanks for believing me.
ARCHER => What are you doing?  Where did you get that gun?
EVE => I took it from my fake husband.
ARCHER => Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
EVE => I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
ARCHER => What more proof do you need?
EVE => Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
ARCHER => It was my first real date ... I borrowed my dad's car and took her out for ribs -- not knowing she was a vegan. To make it worse, she broke her tooth on a pebble that somehow got into her salad -- and we drove around all night, looking for a dentist. I thought the date was a total botch -- but she kissed me. Even though it must have hurt -- she leaned over, ice-pack on her cheek, and kissed me goodnight.  She still has that pebble in the top drawer of her jewelry box.  And I think it still hurts her sometimes -- to kiss me.
EVE => Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
ARCHER => Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
EVE => But you're damn well going to try.
EVE => He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
ARCHER => Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
EVE => What do you mean?
ARCHER => He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
EVE => -- Or maybe all at once.  There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families.  He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.
ARCHER => You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
EVE => Jon, what is it?
ARCHER => The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
EVE => Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
ARCHER => I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
EVE => Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
ARCHER => Eve ...
EVE => Now -- what do we do?
CASTOR => Where's my wife?
LARS => She went to the hospital last night -- she was on call.  Didn't you know?
CASTOR => Find her -- and watch her like a hawk.
CASTOR => Where's Jamie?
EVE => That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
EVE => Don't act so stunned, Jon. As if you don't know how impossible it is to get that girl into a dress.
CASTOR => I'll deal with her later.
EVE => Good.  Because I'm fed up.
EVE => I'm going to the powder room.
CASTOR => Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
LARS => What's taking so long?
EVE => Got a quarter?
EVE => Ladies and gentlemen, friends, I know this is primarily a business gathering ... but I'd like to take this opportunity to tell my husband how proud I am of him ... and how much I love him.
EVE => Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
CASTOR => Back then -- who wasn't?
EVE => Wait a second -- you hated Madonna.  Didn't you?
CASTOR =>  Well well.  Here's a surprise.
CASTOR => There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
JAMIE => Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
CASTOR => Jamie, have you met Ensign Mancini?
CASTOR => Keep your mouth shut and follow me -- or she dies. Right now.
CASTOR => Too bad.  Part of me was hoping you didn't know. Guess which part.
CASTOR => Did you really think it would be that easy, you dumb fucks? I knew you'd make your move -- all I had to do was wait.  Here's tomorrow's front page: In a suicide attack, Castor Troy -- that's you, Jon -- eluded hotel security and detonated a biological bomb, killing dozens of NSA agents and their families -- including my beloved wife and daughter.  -- And the last three people who could expose me are dead.
ARCHER => This is between you and me. Leave my family out of this.
CASTOR => It was between you and me -- but you couldn't let it go.  Even your son -- that wasn't supposed to happen.  Not that I was sorry to see the little bastard go ...
ARCHER => Go -- get help!
WANDA => We heard gunshots -- where's the Commander?
EVE => Wanda, I've got to tell you something.  Something crazy ...
CASTOR => Not bad.
CASTOR => All you've done is postpone the inevitable.
ARCHER => Kill me -- and you kill yourself.
CASTOR => What -- what are you doing?
ARCHER => Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
ARCHER => Running out of time, Castor. Put down the gun and I'll neutralize it.
CASTOR => Do it and your daughter lives.
CASTOR => Did you neutralize it in time?
ARCHER => I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
CASTOR => Five seconds.
ARCHER => Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
CASTOR => Not if I kill you first ...
CASTOR => Give it here, Jamie.
ARCHER => No, Jamie.  Don't do it!
ARCHER => Listen to my voice, Jamie. I'm your father.
CASTOR => It's a trick, Jamie. I'm your father.
CASTOR => Shoot him, Jamie.
ARCHER => Jamie ...
CASTOR => Shoot him!
CASTOR => You idiot.  No kid of mine would miss so badly.
WANDA => Hold it.
CASTOR => Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
BUZZ => What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
CASTOR => Castor Troy almost strangled me to death.  Where the hell were you?
WANDA => You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
CASTOR =>  You can't blame me for trying.
CASTOR => Say goodbye to daddy.
CASTOR => You ungrateful delinquent!
JAMIE => Will someone PLEASE tell me what's going on?
CASTOR => Castor Troy's in there! Move it or I'll have your badges!
CASTOR => Shit.
ARCHER => End of the road, Castor.
CASTOR => You won't shoot me, Jon -- I'm unarmed.
ARCHER => You're right.  I won't shoot you.
ARCHER => Not in the face anyway.
BUZZ => You okay, Commander?
ARCHER => What did you call me?
WANDA => He called you "commander," Commander.
ARCHER => How is he?
EVE => No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
ARCHER => That's what they always say.
WANDA => We'll take him from here.
EVE => But he's my husband.
WANDA => But he works for us.
ARCHER => Hello, Eve.
EVE => I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
ARCHER => Would it?
EVE => Damn right.
JAMIE => Dad?
