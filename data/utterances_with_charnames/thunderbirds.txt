NARRATOR => From a secret island in the South Pacific, the courageous Tracy family run an organization called International Rescue. When disaster strikes, anywhere in the world, they are always first on the scene. They go by the name they gave their incredible machines, the Thunderbirds.
TEACHER => So, gentlemen, we all know that A2 plus B2 equals... C2, that's right. But what happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's E, F and... (Teacher notices Alan looking out window and not paying attention to the lesson) Mr. Tracy!
FERMAT => Alan. Alan!
TEACHER => How kind of you to come back from outer space, Alan. I trust re-entry wasn't too rough?
ALAN TRACY => I was just...
TEACHER => Apparently not (she picks up his notebook which he has been doodling in) "Thunderbirds are go."
ALAN => "That should keep you busy. Yeah, well you can take your 10,000 words and stick them right up your..."
FERMAT => Alan!
ALAN => Headmaster.
HEADMASTER => Mr. Tracy!
ALAN => Miss Garrett.
FERMAT => You gotta be more careful Alan.
ALAN => Why can't I tell 'em I'm a Thunderbird Fermat?
FERMAT => Because technically you're not a Thunderbirds yet. And if your identity was discovered, it would a d-d-di- it could be very bad.
ALAN => I know, I know.
EXCITED KID => It's the Thunderbirds. They're gonna be on TV. Let's go! They're gonna be on TV.
ALAN => Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where are they?
EXCITED KID => In Russia, at an oil rig fire.
ALAN => Great! I'm stuck at school and my brothers are on another cool mission.
FERMAT => Wanna watch?
ALAN => Yeah!
LISA LOWE => We are told this super-rig is now in danger of total collapse.
SCOTT TRACY => Thunderbird 2 this is Thunderbird 1. I have visual, south
JEFF TRACY => FAB. We'll take it from here.
MULLION => Come on! Come on!
JEFF => Scott, get out. That tower's coming down.
SCOTT => Got it.
JEFF => Thunderbird 1 any damage?
SCOTT => Negative, Dad.
ALAN => Come on, come on! Swing around. You can't get close enough, taking that approach angle.
JEFF => This approach angle's no good. Gonna have to swing her around.
SCOTT => Watch the wind shear Thunderbird 2.
JEFF => Scotty, I was watching for wind shear when you were still wearing diapers.
ALAN => Come on, Dad.
JEFF => Whoa! Hold on!
SCOTT => Who needs the diapers now, Dad?
FERMAT => What do they do now?
ALAN => Probably drop the rescue platform from Thunderbird 2.
VIRGIL TRACY => Open 'em up. Here we go. Rescue platform's on its way.
JEFF => Virgil, how's it going?
VIRGIL => It's looking good, Dad.
CREW MEMBER => Come on! Jump!
VIRGIL => Okay, I've got a visual. Hold it there. Targets locked. Firing rescue lines. (Directed toward the
CREW MEMBER => READY
JEFF => Alright, let's haul them out.
FERMAT => Commencing reverse thrust.
JEFF => Okay, let's bring 'em home.
CREW MEMBER => Look out! (a couple of crew members bump into each other as they are hoisted up)
ALAN => Man they gotta get 'em out fast. That rig's gonna blow.
CREW MEMBER => Hang on!
JEFF => Whoa sorry, boys. Hold on tight. Here we go.
ALAN => Come on, Virgil.
VIRGIL => Hold on guys
JEFF => How you doing, son?
VIRGIL => Never better
JEFF => Thunderbird 1, commence knockdown procedure.
SCOTT => FAB, Thunderbird 2. (after pressing a bunch of buttons on his control panel) Lining up target.
JEFF => Bull's-eye! Outstanding shot. All right boys, let's take these babies home.
LISA LOWE => As you can see the fire has been extinguished. The rocket fired from Thunderbird 1 has
CHUCK => That was great work, Lisa. Thanks a lot.
ALAN => That's another good one, diaper boy.
HEADMASTER => Tracy! (after finding Alan in the sea of boys he continues) There's someone here for you.
FERMAT => Sure beats the bus!
ALAN => Definitely!
LADY PENELOPE => Fantastic. Now, will any of these gorgeous young things be joining you?
ALAN => Just Fermat.
LADY PENELOPE => Quite right.
ALAN => Lady Penelope, why are you in America? Are you on a mission for my father?
LADY PENELOPE => Alan, shh! I am an undercover agent, so please try to be discreet. (camera pans over to
FERMAT => Hi, Parker.
PARKER => Good afternoon, Master Hackenbacker.
ALAN => Hi, Nosey.
PARKER => Less of that attitude, or I shall be obliged to deliver the Parker Haymaker.
ALAN => Okay, bring it on, big guy.
LADY PENELOPE => Try not to run over any children, Parker.
PARKER => Very good, milady.
LADY PENELOPE => Come on, Parker, chop chop!
ALAN => All right!
FERMAT => Whoa!
ALAN => YES!
FERMAT => Yeah! the boys high five
LADY PENELOPE => Oh, look, Parker. Pink is the new black this season.
PARKER => I'm very glad to hear it, milady.
LADY PENELOPE => And hemlines are going up.
PARKER => That is good news, milady.
LADY PENELOPE => Oh and apparently England won the football last night.
PARKER => Yes! Eng-er-land! (his hands go off the steering wheel and the car begins to move to one side)
LADY PENELOPE => Calm down, Parker.
PARKER => Yes, milady. Sorry, milady.
PANHEAD'S MOTHER => Come on, baby. Out you jump. (Turns to her teenage son who has a pan stuck on
PANHEAD => Even better! It's the Thunderbirds!
VIRGIL => OK, lock it up. Let's go. Let's move it. Hey, we need some help over here.
JEFF => Mission complete. Thunderbird 1 we are good to go.
SCOTT => FAB.
THE HOOD => Ah, the chariot of the gods. Having dallied with the mortals,
PARKER => Pardon me, milady. Approaching Tracy Island. And radar indicates we have some company.
LADY PENELOPE => Now, that's showing off.
ALAN => I wish that was me.
BRAINS => I'm about to run post flight checks, Mr Tracy. Anything I sh-sh-sh-
JEFF => Brains, I noticed a build-up of vibration on Thunderbird 2, followed by illumination of the number 5
BRAINS => Okay, Mr. Tracy, I'll ch-ch-ch-study the flight data and guidance processor.
ALAN => Dad!
JEFF => Alan! Let me look at you. He hold Alan at arm's length and then looks him over. He then looks
VIRGIL => Hey Sprout! ruffles his hair
SCOTT => ruffles his hair Hey Buddy!
ONAHA => Dinner's ready. Come and get it.
JEFF => Onaha, it smells delicious. I am starved.
ALAN => So Dad, I saw the mission on TV. It looked dangerous.
JEFF => Saving lives is a dangerous business. But it's what we do.
ALAN => Do you think the fire was caused by thermal up draughts? I mean that would explain the-- (Jeff
JEFF => Whoa, whoa, whoa, enough shop talk. I want to hear about school.
ALAN => School's boring. Plus I've been thinking, maybe I could be home-educated now. That way, I could
JEFF => No short cuts, Alan. No school, no rockets. Say, why aren't you wearing your retainer?
SCOTT => So I'm getting the reading telling me that the wind is blowing 60 knots, right up my keister.
VIRGIL => No kidding.
ALAN => Did you try readjust the flaps?
SCOTT => Well that's the first thing I did, Sprout! It's not my first day in a Thunderbird you know.
GORDON => Try and keep up!
VIRGIL => Yeah and don't you have homework to do or something?
GORDON => Unless he's blown up this school, like the last one!
SCOTT => Yeah, keep Alan away from the ships, he's a hazard.
JEFF => Okay, that's enough. Pass the salad.
VIRGIL => Man, I haven't seen that much fire since that volcano in Fiji.
SCOTT => That wasn't Fiji that was Istanbul.
VIRGIL => No, no, Istanbul was the earthquake.
SCOTT => Yeah well, nothing compares to Argentina.
ALAN => Dad, I'm not really hungry. Come on, Fermat. Let's go.
FERMAT => But! I'm not done!  Okay.
JEFF => Kyrano, have you seen Lady P?
KYRANO => By the pool.
JEFF => Of course.
LADY PENELOPE => Parker.
FERMAT => We're not supposed to go in there. We could get in trouble.
ALAN => Ah, you worry too much.
FERMAT => Where'd you get the access code for Thunderbird 1 anyway?
ALAN => Fermat, my friend, what you don't know, can't hurt you.
LADY PENELOPE => I'll be right there. It seems the fire at the oil rig was no accident.
JEFF => Any suspects?
LADY PENELOPE => Not yet, but I'll keep you posted.
ALAN => Thanks for bringing Alan home.
LADY PENELOPE => My pleasure. Any excuse to visit paradise.
JEFF => Tintin!
TINTIN => Hey, Mr. Tracy.
LADY PENELOPE => Hello, Tintin.
TINTIN => Good evening, Lady Penelope.
JEFF => Did you know Alan's home?
TINTIN => Alan's back? (changes her tone to a more pleasant one) I mean, oh,
JEFF => When are those two going to get along?
LADY PENELOPE => When Tintin decides the time is right. Girls always fire ahead of boys with that sort of
JEFF => What sort of thing?
LADY PENELOPE => Romance.
JEFF => Alan and Tintin? I didn't see that one coming.
LADY PENELOPE => No, you wouldn't.
JEFF => Have a safe flight home, Penny.
LADY PENELOPE => Thanks, Jeff.
ALAN => Okay, Fermat. Run pre-flight checks.
FERMAT => Right. Hydraulic systems are green.
ALAN => Commence main engine sequence.
FERMAT => FAB, Alan.
ALAN => Couldn't hurt to just fire up the instruments.
FERMAT => No wait, Alan! That's the(Thunderbird 1 begins to start up and Fermat shouts) Wrong switch!
ALAN => Oh God. (There is loud beeping coming from the control panel and the boys can't shut down
JEFF =>  Alan, my office. Now. (Thunderbird 1 shuts
FERMAT => It just did.
ALAN => I can't believe it.
FERMAT => We're so b-b-busted.
FERMAT => Look at this.
ALAN => What is it?
FERMAT => Looks like some sort of, gallium-electrolyte compound.
ALAN => We gotta get out of here.
ALAN => Dad, I know you're mad. I shouldn't have been in the ship, but if you just give me a minute to
JEFF => You're damn right you shouldn't have been in there!
ALAN => But, nothing happened Dad. I had it under control.
JEFF => Under control? Do you have any idea of the importance of secrecy in our operation? You fired up
ALAN => Yeah, I understand. I understand you don't want me to be a Thunderbird. You don't want me to
JEFF => I've heard enough. You're grounded for the rest of spring break.
ALAN => But, Dad!
JEFF => Bottom line, Alan. You need to grow up.
ALAN => Then let me. (he stalks toward the door before whispering,) Please!
JEFF => Hey, John. I was just about to turn in. What can I do for you?
JOHN TRACY => I could sure use a pizza. You know a place that delivers?
JEFF => 30 minutes or it's free, right? Anything else on your mind?
JOHN => Well, got a forest fire in Vladivostok, a typhoon heading for Singapore. What's happening on
JEFF => Alan's home for spring break.
JOHN => Yeah, I thought I could see a storm brewing in your region.
JEFF => Teenagers.
JOHN => Well, we've all been there. And Dad, you've done a great job since Mom died.
JEFF => Thanks, John. Keep an eye on that typhoon for us. And, uh, I'll call Vladivostok, see if they need
JOHN => FAB, Dad. Sleep tight.
FERMAT => Morning, Dad.
BRAINS => Hey, son. There's something I'd like to sh-sh-sh- Here, take a look.
FERMAT => The neural-net control system?
BRAINS => It's great to have you back. I bet you didn't think spring break was going to be this w- w-fun.
BRAINS => And that tiny phone lifts up, perfect.
FERMAT => Dad?
BRAINS => N-n-n- Almost perfect.
FERMAT => There's something I want to talk to you about.
BRAINS => Oh. Right. Oh. OK, right. You're having problems with a g-g-g-chi-chi-chi-wo-wo-female?
FERMAT => N-no! No. Alan and I found some sort of gallium compound on the nosecone of Thunderbird
BRAINS => We should check that out st-st-st-immediately.
FERMAT => That'd be g-g-g-swell!
MULLION => The island is in sight.
THE HOOD => Transom, I need you.
TRANSOM => Yes, sir. Sir, our cloaking device has evaded their detection
THE HOOD => Mullion.
MULLION => Sir? Sir, armed and ready. Shall I target the main structure?
THE HOOD => Why would I want to destroy what will soon be mine? One of the principle tenets of Eastern
MULLION =>  This is ridiculous.
THE HOOD => It will be almost impossible to force the Thunderbirds to leave their island. On the other
THE HOOD => The Thunderbirds' purpose is to rescue. All we need do is give them the victim. (The Hood
TRANSOM => Straightaway, sir. Target acquisition of Thunderbird 5 is locked.
THE HOOD => Fire.
JOHN => What the?
JOHN => Thunderbird 5 to Tracy Island. Mayday! Mayday!
BRAINS => Switching to Command and Control Center. (Brains uses a palm scanner to activate Command

BRAINS => Yep.
JEFF => Thunderbirds are go.
GORDON => Check retros. Go.
JEFF => Go to maximum thrust.
THE HOOD => There goes the cavalry. But who will rescue the rescuers?
FERMAT => Alan! Tintin! Thunderbird 5 has been hit! Thunderbird 5 has been hit! Thunderbird 5 has been
ALAN => Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay don't panic. Don't panic.
ALAN => On the other hand.
MULLION => We made land.
THE HOOD => Cut them off.
TRANSOM => Activating communications blackout.
BRAINS => What the he-he-devil is going on?
BRAINS => Mr. Tracy, do you copy?
BRAINS => Thunderbird 3 please respond.
ALAN => How'd they find the island? Do you think it was what I did in Thunderbird 1? Do you think I ruined
FERMAT => No! That compound we found could have some sort of transmitting capability.
TINTIN => We have to do something.
FERMAT => My dad's in the control room, but how do we get there now?
ALAN => The vents. Let's go! We have to get a message to my dad.
JOHN => I'm losing all power. Repeat, I'm losing all power.
JEFF => Hold on, John. We're coming in. Gordon, prepare for immediate docking.
GORDON => You got it, Dad. Reverse main thrusters on my mark. Three, two, one.
JEFF => Easy. Watch the roll.
VIRGIL => Roll index angle minus two degrees.
GORDON => We're locked on.
JEFF => Nice work
SCOTT => Tunnel hatch secured.
JEFF => Emergency packs boys. Let's move!
JEFF => We're in. Let's go!
JEFF => John! Scott, tackle that fire.
JOHN => Am I glad to see you guys!
JEFF => Easy, you're hurt. Virgil, take care of your brother. Gordon, give me a damage assessment.
ALAN => Come on, hurry!
TRANSOM => One-inch steel plate, with sequential titanium locking mechanism.
FERMAT => Watch out for the guards.
ALAN => Get in, get in.
BRAINS =>  Who-o-o-o- What's going on?
THE HOOD => So, this is Mount Olympus. And these are the Thunderbirds. I should have guessed. Jeff
ALAN => Just keep going straight ahead.
TINTIN => Okay.
TRANSOM => Professor Hackenbacker? We met at last year's international conference on
THE HOOD => Transom, concentrate!
TRANSOM => Sorry, sir. The command control switch, is here. Fingerprint recognition system.
THE HOOD => Professor. Please. Activate the control switch.
BRAINS => N-n-n-n-n- You must be kidding.
THE HOOD => Professor, you and I share an interest in the science of the mind. The difference is, I was
BRAINS => Fu-Fu-Fu- No way!
THE HOOD => Activate the control switch, Prof! (Uses his powers to make BRAINS move) Like a puppet on
TRANSOM => We have control.
MULLION => Get up.
TRANSOM => Sorry, Professor. Nothing personal.
SCOTT => We got a warning light on our EPS system.
JEFF => Attempt manual override.
SCOTT => No, that's negative!
ALAN => That's it.
FERMAT => Okay, this one.
JEFF => Back to Thunderbird 3 now. (turns to help an injured John) John, we gotta move.
GORDON => The locking mechanism's jammed!
THE HOOD => Attention, Thunderbird 5. As you can see I have taken over your facilities. You no longer
ALAN => They've taken over.
THE HOOD => Warm them up, Transom.
TRANSOM => Increasing temperature to maximum.
ALAN => Who's the bald freak?
KYRANO => You? The Hood uses his powers on him and he falls down clutching his head.
TINTIN => Dad!
FERMAT => They've got m-my dad.
JEFF => Okay, you have our attention. Who are you? What do you want?
THE HOOD => Oh how rude of me. You can call me The Hood. Now, listen, Mr. Tracy. We won't be
SCOTT => You'll never get away with it.
JEFF => Why the Thunderbirds?
THE HOOD => An eye for an eye, Mr. Tracy.
JEFF => An eye for an eye?
THE HOOD => Perhaps you've forgotten me, but surely you remember saving the life of my brother,
KYRANO => Turns to the video phone that the Hood has been using to communicate with Thunderbird
THE HOOD => Take them away.
MULLION => Yes, sir.
ALAN => Whoa.
TINTIN => That makes The Hood my uncle?
FERMAT => Every family has a black sh-sh- a black sh- (Sneezes and everyone in the Command and
FERMAT => This room's murder with my allergies.
THE HOOD => You left me to die that day. You may have broken my body but you've no idea how
JEFF => Wait! (Video link cuts dead and then the scene cuts to Thunderbird 5.) Scott, status report.
SCOTT => CO2 levels are rising.
JEFF => Alright, wire the oxygen scrubber to the emergency batteries. Clean the air.
VIRGIL => How long will that give us?
JOHN => About four hours.
MULLION => Someone's there. (Mullion walks over to the ceiling, he is standing directly below where
TINTIN => Run! Run!
ALAN => No, jump! We can get through to the silos.
THE HOOD => Apparently, the island is not as secure as you thought. (he looks at the old photos that were
TRANSOM =>  Here they are. Thunderbird 2 silo, in the
THE HOOD => Seal them in.
ALAN => Hold on!
TINTIN => The doors! You guys, let's go! C'mon
FERMAT => Go! Go!
ALAN => This way. (They run toward the still closing Thunderbird 1 silo door.)
FERMAT =>  No!
TINTIN => They've got us trapped. What now?
FERMAT => If we can get to the Thunderbird 1's silo, we can escape through the service tunnel. But we
ALAN => I'll use the Thunderizer on the door.
ALAN => You guys get the goons with the Firefly!
FERMAT => Alan! This equipment is only to be used in an emergency. (Alan and Tintin give him looks) I
ALAN => Yeah.
TINTIN => Here they come. Fermat, can you drive this thing?
FERMAT => Uh, no.
TINTIN => Hey, watch it!
FERMAT => I took microbiology, not driver's ed. Set the pressure to maximum.
TINTIN => Got it.
MULLION =>  Retreat!
TINTIN => Let's move it.
ALAN => That's it. Time to thunderize. (After the door has a hole cut in it.) Yes!
ALAN => Come on, let's go!
MULLION => Get 'em!
ALAN => Where's Fermat?
TINTIN => Fermat!
ALAN => Fermat!
FERMAT => Coming!
ALAN => Hurry up. (the children are now in Thunderbird 1's silo) What were you doing back there,
FERMAT => I had an-n-n idea.
ALAN => Just try and keep up, okay? I'll open the tunnel. We gotta keep moving. (Alan types in a pass
ALAN => Go back. Yell when you see them coming. (tries another pass code)
THE HOOD => Alan. You can run if you want. Were you surprised to hear what your father did to me? It is
ALAN => We can't go this way. He's there.
FERMAT => No!  Ow. What are we gonna do, Alan?
ALAN => I don't know. I'm thinking, okay? (Alan looks at the control panel behind the Hood and sees a
TINTIN => That's your idea?
THE HOOD => It's not me you're angry at, Alan.
ALAN => It's not you I'm aiming at. (Alan fires another rock and this time hits the button and the floor
THE HOOD => Get them!
MULLION => Transom, fire up Thunderbird 1. And set it on broil!
TRANSOM => No sign of them.
MULLION => Of course not, the little brats went up like firecrackers. Pop, pop, pop! (laughs at Brains and
THE HOOD => Don't, give him the satisfaction, Professor. This is taking too long. Pick out the equipment
MULLION => Yes, sir.
FERMAT => How about a little warning next time you pull a stunt like that?
ALAN => Relax, Fermat. It's just a little water.
FERMAT => I could have drowned.
ALAN => You mean you can't swim?!
FERMAT => I repeat, I could have drowned.
ALAN => I said I was sorry, Fermat. Just put this behind us, Okay? We gotta watch each other's backs.
FERMAT => Thank you.
TINTIN => Boo!
ALAN => No, c'mon Tintin, stay there.
TINTIN => You're worse than a couple of girls. Hurry up and get dressed. Those are nice
FERMAT => Data from Tracy Island is sent to Thunderbird 5 via satellite, right?
ALAN => Right.
FERMAT => So, there's a miniscule possibility that if we reach the satellite station, we could
ALAN => Blow it up!
FERMAT => No, we could hack in to it and give control back to Thunderbird 5.
ALAN => Good thinking, Fermat. Alright, let's do it. (Alan starts drawing the plan in the sand) Here's the
TINTIN => Good. Except that we're here, not there, and the transmitter is there, not here. We have to go
FERMAT => But that's f-f- off limits.
TINTIN => It's gonna be dangerous.
ALAN => I'm in. (All three of them put their hands together) We gotta get up there fast! All our folks are
FERMAT => Actually, he's not going anywhere for now.
ALAN => The guidance processor for Thunderbird 2. You can't take off without it. Fermat you're a genius.
FERMAT => Alan, my friend, what you don't know, can't hurt you.
LADY PENELOPE => Parker?
PARKER => Milady?
LADY PENELOPE => We have an emergency.
LADY PENELOPE => What a charming fellow.
LADY PENELOPE => Come in.
LADY PENELOPE => Have a look at this, Parker. (There is a computer monitor near her feet.) He, and this
PARKER => Sounds like an alias, milady.
LADY PENELOPE => Quite right, Parker. Real name: Trangh Belagant. Assumed dead when
PARKER => Milady, that's Mr. Tracy's loyal manservant, Kyrano.
LADY PENELOPE => How's my schedule, Parker?
PARKER => You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord Marlborough, a benefit gala for the Institute of the
LADY PENELOPE => I suppose that's urgent.
PARKER => Yes, milady. There was also a bridge collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic eruption in
LADY PENELOPE => The Thunderbirds haven't responded?
PARKER => No, milady. And the media is awash in speculation vis--vis their whereabouts. Parker turns on
CHUCK => Over to Lisa Lowe.
LISA LOWE => Chuck, disaster after disaster around the world today and still no sight of the Thunderbirds.
LADY PENELOPE => I think it's time to send the emergency signal, Parker.
PARKER => I fear you're not wrong, milady.
LISA LOWE => Lisa Lowe. Back to you, Chuck.
ALAN => I'm telling you, Fermat, it was like The Hood was inside my head back there.
FERMAT => What do you mean, Alan?
ALAN => Maybe he can read minds or control minds or something.
FERMAT => Don't be silly, Alan. Everything can be explained by science.
ALAN => I'm just trying to figure out his weakness. Everybody has an Achilles heel, right?
FERMAT => My Achilles heel is actually my Achilles heel. It's got a blister the size of a basketball. Tintin!
TINTIN => Stop?
FERMAT => Yes!
TINTIN => No!
FERMAT => Okay.
ALAN => No more cheeseburgers for you, Fermat.
LADY PENELOPE => Any word?
PARKER => Nothing, milady.
LADY PENELOPE => Right. You will have to tell Lord Marlborough that I've broken my shooting arm. We
PARKER => Yes, milady.
LADY PENELOPE => The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot of trouble. And I don't like that. Let's go,
MULLION => Ready for launch. We'll use this to get into the vaults.
THE HOOD => Subtle, as usual, Mullion.
MULLION => I didn't realize we'd be getting points for style. We're robbing banks, remember.
THE HOOD => Don't worry. You'll get your money.
MULLION =>  Transom, initiate pre-flight
MULLION => What's going on?
TRANSOM => It's the guidance processor.
MULLION => What's wrong with it?
TRANSOM => There isn't one.
MULLION => Aaargh!
THE HOOD => Clever Alan. It's the children. They have it.
MULLION => No way. They're dead. No one could live through something like that.
THE HOOD => I did. Get them, Mullion. Take whatever you need. And make sure you get the guidance
FERMAT => Alan, don't you think Tintin is blossoming?
ALAN => Blossoming?! What's that supposed to mean?
FERMAT => Come on, Alan. You've a c-crush on her.
ALAN => You've got to be kidding. I mean, she's. She's not that bad, I guess.
TINTIN => Okay, guys, take five.
FERMAT => Five isn't going to do it!
TINTIN => Guys?
TINTIN => Don't move.
FERMAT =>  Whoa
ALAN => What is it?
TINTIN => Hexdrotilous scorpion.
ALAN => Is that dangerous?
FERMAT => .025 milligrams of its venom is fatal.
ALAN => So, dangerous is in fact an understatement.
FERMAT => Watch out!
ALAN => Tintin, what was that?
TINTIN => Let's get going.
ALAN => Hey! She has the same powers as her uncle, The Hood.
FERMAT => You think?
ALAN => Must run in the family. Did you do that?
TINTIN => Just drop it, okay?
ALAN => Still think everything can be explained by science?
FERMAT => Not girls!
JEFF => Scott? Gordon? You all right?
GORDON => We're okay.
SCOTT => The heat exchanger has blown.
JEFF => You don't say.
MULLION => Come on! Those brats are in here somewhere.
ALAN => How we doing Fermat?
FERMAT => Don't rush me Alan. This is very d-delicate equipment. Which is
ALAN => Can you fix it?
FERMAT => Yea- Maybe, but I'll need something to solder with.
ALAN => We're in the middle of nowhere Fermat, where are you going to find something like that. (Tintin
ALAN => Ow!
FERMAT => Perfect.
TINTIN => Gee Alan, I never figured you for a crybaby.
ALAN => I'm gonna kill you.
FERMAT => What'd he say?
TINTIN => I think it was some sort of apology.
FERMAT => I got it, yes! Y-y-you the man, Fermat! Okay, first step is to establish contact with Thunderbird
ALAN => Dad?
JOHN => It's Alan!
JEFF => Alan, where are you? Are you safe?
ALAN => I'm at the satellite relay station with Fermat and Tintin. Fermat's gonna hack into the main
JEFF => We're standing by.
FERMAT => Okay, we're almost there.
TRANSOM => Goodness me, Professor. You're so good-looking without your glasses on. I think you may
TRANSOM => Oh now that's not fair. Just when things were starting to sizzle.
TRANSOM => A burst of transmission from the island's satellite station.
THE HOOD => And give Mullion the coordinates.
TRANSOM => Take the main track southeast, then head up Satellite Hill.
FERMAT => They're onto us! We're being jammed!
ALAN => Can you finish?
FERMAT => I'll try.
JEFF => Alan, what's happening?
ALAN => Hang in there Dad, one more minute, okay?
FERMAT => It's not going to work Alan. The signal's too weak for data transmission.
ALAN => Dad, can you hear me? They're jamming the signal. We're going to lose you. Don't worry, I'll
JEFF => That's a negative! It's too dangerous. Follow emergency procedure. Wait for Lady Penelope at the
ALAN => Dad!
JEFF => Alan we're losing you! Alan!
ALAN => Dad!
FERMAT => No!
ALAN => Useless!
FERMAT => It is now.
TINTIN => I'm sorry, Alan. This is hard on all of us.
ALAN => No, it's okay. I'm fine.
FERMAT => You don't have to be such a tough guy Alan. I'm worried about my dad too.
TINTIN => I'd do anything to be with my parents right now.
ALAN => But The Hood knows we're alive now. We have to go.
FERMAT => Even worse, they know exactly
FERMAT => Where we are!
MULLION => Come on!
FERMAT => Great, more water.
ALAN => Tintin, can you slow 'em down?
TINTIN => I'd be delighted.
ALAN => Then do it. And meet us at the junk yard. Come on, Fermat.
ALAN => This'll get us out of here.
MULLION => There! Come on!
MULLION => Straight ahead.
FERMAT => It's gonna make this thing hard to control you know.
ALAN => No problem.
FERMAT => You really must be careful not to exceed four bars of boost or else
ALAN => I said no problem.
TINTIN => Guys, let's go we've got to get out of here. What is this?
FERMAT => It's a hoversled.
ALAN => It's our ticket out, unless you've got a better idea.
TINTIN => Yeah, let's wait for Lady Penelope, like your dad said.
FERMAT =>  Here.
ALAN => Great plan. Let's sit and wait to get caught. I say we do something. Now! Right, Fermat?
FERMAT => Actually, I agree with Tintin. I don't think this is s-s-safe.
ALAN => You don't think anything is s s-safe.
FERMAT => Just because I s-s-stutter doesn't mean that I'm wrong. If we're a team, we should make
ALAN => Do you guys want to sit here and take a vote? Or do you want to get out of here? Cuz I'm going.
TINTIN => You can be a real jerk sometimes.
MULLION => Go! Go!
TINTIN => (After looking behind her and seeing Mullion and the other guards in the car getting closer to
MULLION => Come on! Faster!
FERMAT => Alan! You're going too fast!
ALAN => I need more speed to get above the trees. Hang on!
ALAN => What'd I tell you guys? (looks down and sees Fermat and Tintin being captured.) Oh, no.
TINTIN => What are you doing?
FERMAT => Oh, no! Not the fridge!
ONAHA => Tintin!
BRAINS => Hey son.
KYRANO => Sweetheart, are you okay?
TINTIN => I'm fine, Dad.
MULLION =>  Cool off, kid! (he
PARKER => Tracy Island approaching, milady. Switching to aqua mode.
LADY PENELOPE => Isn't life fun, sometimes?
PARKER => Rib-tickling, milady.
THE HOOD => What is it?
TRANSOM => We have an unidentified craft approaching the island at high speed.
ALAN => Lady P!
JEFF => Phew! Somebody roll down a window. It's getting a little hot in here.
VIRGIL => Re-entry into Earth's atmosphere in 37 minutes.
SCOTT => Oxygen's out in 30 so we won't feel it.
JEFF => Stop it!
GORDON => Come on, Dad. The situation's hopeless.
JEFF => No, it's not. There's still time. We've got people on the ground working for us.
GORDON => Alan? He's just a kid!
JEFF => He's a Tracy.
LADY PENELOPE => This doesn't look good, Parker.
PARKER => No, milady.
LADY PENELOPE => That bougainvillea is absolutely parched, and someone should do something about
THE HOOD =>  Whom do we have here? Mullion.
MULLION => I must warn you that I know judo, krai magna, and tae kwon do.
LADY PENELOPE => And I know Parker.
PARKER => Milady.
MULLION =>  You've broken my nose.
PARKER => Yes, that was very much the intention of the maneuver.
TRANSOM =>  Whoa!
LADY PENELOPE => One tries so hard in life to sort things out on an intellectual-slash-conversational level.
PARKER =>  Shall I bring the car around, milady?
LADY PENELOPE => Parker, have a bit of a lie-down.
PARKER =>  Excuse me, milady. (punches him and after that has no
THE HOOD => Ah, Lady Penelope! Of course he has his palace. Why not his princess?
LADY PENELOPE => Flattery will get you nowhere. (after she blocks the metal bar that Transom was trying
PARKER => Coming through, milady.
PARKER =>  Duck, milady!
ALAN => He's weak. Using his power makes him weak. (The Hood, having heard something looks over
THE HOOD => You're formidable opponent Lady Penelope. More than a match for most men.
LADY PENELOPE => That's not saying much, then, is it?
THE HOOD =>  I suggest you
LADY PENELOPE => Don't try your parlor games on me you sad, little man. You've committed a serious
THE HOOD => How are you, Alan? (he uses his powers on Parker and Lady
PARKER => Really, sir, don't mind me. This isn't the first time my head's been pulverized. And it's never
ALAN => Stop! Stop! I'll give it to you. (throws the guidance processor
THE HOOD => You made a match of it, Alan, I'll give you that.  Put them with the
MULLION => You're coming with me. (Grabs Alan's arms and throws Lady
LADY PENELOPE => Put me down! This outfit is couture.
JEFF => Don't go to sleep. John, look at me. Keep your eyes open.
MULLION => You need to cool off, milady.
TINTIN => Lady Penelope!
LADY PENELOPE => Big oaf! (The fridge door closes leaving them trapped) Right, that's quite
ALAN => So, how does it feel to be right all the time?
FERMAT => Not b-bad, actually.
ALAN => I'm so sorry, Fermat.
FERMAT => We make quite a pair. It's hard for me to t-t-talk. It's hard for you to l-l-listen.
LADY PENELOPE => Parker, I have an idea.
PARKER => Excellent, milady.
LADY PENELOPE => Brains, how long do Jeff and the boys have?
BRAINS => I can't think. I'm too c-c-cold.
TRANSOM => The guidance processor has been installed.
TRANSOM => Thunderbird 2 is ready for takeoff.
THE HOOD => What is our ETA?
MULLION => Under an hour. Bank of London, here we come!
ALAN => We've got to be quick. The Hood's getting away.
PARKER => In position, milady.
LADY PENELOPE => Here we go.
ALAN => Yes!
PARKER => Good shot, milady.
LADY PENELOPE => Come on, Parker. Let's give the bad guys a good
PARKER =>  This seems to be a six-lever mortise, milady.
LADY PENELOPE => I love it when your checkered past comes in handy Parker.
PARKER => Thank you, milady. Unfortunately, I fear I shall need a piece of wire to access the mechanism.
LADY PENELOPE => Will this suffice, Parker?
PARKER => Most certainly, milady.
LADY PENELOPE => I didn't actually need it, anyway.
PARKER => Of course not, milady. (Parker gets the door open)
FERMAT => Quick! They're getting away
ALAN => Okay, everyone get to the control room.
FERMAT => Hat.
FERMAT => Get in there quick, Fermat, and save my family. Then we'll get The Hood. Good luck!
FERMAT => Looks like they slipped a backdoor key into the access codes.
BRAINS => I'll follow your lead, son.
LADY PENELOPE =>  Thunderbird 5 come in.
ALAN => How long have they got before re-entry?
FERMAT => 90 seconds and counting
FERMAT => I'm in!

ALAN => Dad!
JEFF => Alan! Well done.
FERMAT => Mr. Tracy, confirm access protocol.
JOHN => Confirmed. We are back online.
BRAINS => Gravity is restored. Put Thunderbird f-f- your craft into geostational orbit immediately.
JEFF => FAB, Brains.
JEFF => Looks like we're good to go.
ALAN => Dad, are you all right?
JEFF => We're fine. We still have a job to do. Where's The Hood?
BRAINS => He's in Thunderbird 2 Mr. Tracy headed for L-L-L
LADY PENELOPE => London.
BRAINS => She's right.
ALAN => He's got the Mole on board.
JOHN => Looks like Thunderbird 3 lost a booster, Dad. We'll never get there in time.
ALAN => Let me go after The Hood. He'll destroy everything you've built everything the Thunderbirds stand
JEFF => Negative. I'm sorry it's too risky.
ALAN => I can do this. You know I can. What am I saying? (Puts his arms around Tintin and Fermat) We
JEFF => Okay, Alan. We'll meet you there. Thunderbirds are go!
ALAN => FAB.
JEFF => Okay, boys, we are outta here.
TINTIN => Are we really going?

BRAINS => Thunderbird 1 come in.
ALAN => Roger, Brains.
BRAINS => Situation update, Thunderbird 3 is about to initiate separation.
LADY PENELOPE => Boys, Thunderbird 2 is in final approach to London.
ALAN => I know The Hood's weakness, Fermat. I can stop him if we get there in time.
FERMAT => Stand by. We're going to maximum thrust.
ALL => Whoaaaa!
JEFF => Gordon, heat 'em up.
CHUCK => We're getting reports of some kind of incident in London involving the Thunderbirds. Lisa, are
LISA LOWE => Chuck, I'm here in Jubilee Gardens where Thunderbird 2 has made an impromptu landing,
THE HOOD => Set a course for the vault.
TRANSOM => Sir, if we continue on our present course, we'll sever the monorail's subterranean supports.
THE HOOD => Stay on course.
TRANSOM => But sir, we'll cause a major disaster.
THE HOOD => No, we won't. The Thunderbirds will.
LADY PENELOPE => Let's get her down, boys.
ALAN => Initiate landing, Fermat.
FERMAT => Right.
ALAN => Retros at 75 flaps to 16.
FERMAT => FAB.
FERMAT => You're going too fast.
ALAN => Thanks. Retros to 90.
LADY PENELOPE => Textbook, boys.
TRANSOM => Activating electromagnetic pulse to disable the bank's security systems.
MULLION => ETA, one minute.
LADY PENELOPE => Parker, meet me at the Bank of London.
PARKER => Yes, milady.'
JEFF => Ride it out, boys!
ALAN => The Hood's getting away.
TINTIN => Those people can't hold on much longer.
FERMAT => What are we gonna do, Alan?
ALAN => We're the Thunderbirds. Our duty is to save those people. Brains, we're going into the accident
BRAINS => FAB, Thunderbird 2 and good luck.
ALAN => Brains, the monorail is down. Repeat, the monorail is down. I'm going underwater in
FERMAT => Me?! Fly alone?!
ALAN => Fermat, the Thunderbirds need you right now. I need you.
FERMAT => FAB, Alan.
JEFF => Brains, come in, what's the situation?
BRAINS => The Hood has caused a disaster with the Mole mono-mono-mono- one-track railway is down in
JEFF => Where's Thunderbird 1?
BRAINS => It's on the ground. The k-k-kids are in Thunderbird 2.
JEFF => FAB. We're right behind 'em.
MULLION => Look at all this gold!
THE HOOD => Stay focused, Mullion. Nine more banks to go.
ALAN => Fermat, deploying Thunderbird 4 in three, two, one, Thunderbird 4 is go. I can see the monorail.
ALAN => Don't panic, guys.
ALAN => Fermat, I'll hold the monorail in place. Can you get a line on that stanchion and lift it up?
FERMAT => I can't get a clear fix on the target. I might hit the passengers.
TINTIN => I'll go and fix it myself.
FERMAT => What you mean swim?!
TINTIN => Get me as close as you can.
ALAN => How are we doing on that line Fermat?
FERMAT => Just look out your window.
FERMAT => Come on, Tintin, come on!
ALAN => Come on. Come on, Tintin. You can do this. (Tintin successfully connects the rope to the
ALAN => OK, Fermat, we need a lift.
FERMAT => FAB, Alan. Commencing reverse thrust.
ALAN => That was amazing, Tintin.
TINTIN => Thank you.
ALAN => Nice job, Fermat.
FERMAT => Nothing to it, really.
ALAN =>  Easy does it.
SCOTT => There they are!
ALAN =>  Glad you could finally join us.
JEFF => Hey don't get cocky after one mission. We still have a dangerous situation. I need you boys to
VIRGIL => Okay let's clean it up guys.
JEFF => We got to get to the Bank of London fast.
ALAN => Lady Penelope went after The Hood.
JEFF => I know, she may need help.
THE HOOD => Ashes to ashes, diamonds to diamonds. Lady Penelope. What an unpleasant surprise.
LADY PENELOPE => Don't be rude. I can't tell you what a pleasure it would be to use my little finger to pull
THE HOOD => Mullion. (uses his powers to knock the gun from Lady Penelope's hand)
LADY PENELOPE => That's not cricket.
THE HOOD => I'm sorry. The only part of sport I ever liked was winning.
LADY PENELOPE => How ghastly.
ALAN => Hey, Dad. That stuff The Hood said, about you leaving him to die. He was lying, right?
JEFF => No. See, you can't save everyone, Alan. It doesn't matter how hard you try or how brave you are.
ALAN => What was Mom like?
JEFF => She was a lot like you. Come on, we've got a job to do.
THE HOOD => Finish her off, Mullion.
LADY PENELOPE => Shame on you. I always despise a man who delegates the important jobs. (sees the
JEFF => Good timing, Parker.
PARKER => Good afternoon Mr. Tracy.
JEFF => Come with us.
PARKER => My pleasure, Mr. Tracy.
THE HOOD => The Thunderbirds. They're here. Kill them all.
JEFF => Alan, you guys stay here with Parker. I'm gonna go find Lady Penelope.
ALAN => But what about The Hood? (Alan points behind Parker) Look out, Parker! (When Parker turns
PARKER => Master Tracy!
FERMAT => Look out, Parker!
PARKER => Alright, that's enough of that.
MULLION => Don't move. (Parker motions for the kids to run forward but Transom
TRANSOM => Go on, then.
PARKER => No, sorry. I can't hit a lady.
TINTIN => Allow me. (she kick Transom and runs off, Transom chases her)
MULLION => I've been waiting to get my hands on you brats.
PARKER => And I've been waiting to get my hands on you.
PARKER => Ow, now that was a punch.
FERMAT => Parker, can we wrap this up?
PARKER => What did you have in mind, Master Hackenbacker?
FERMAT => Strategically speaking, the best odds of success lie with the Parker Haymaker.
PARKER => I concur.
JEFF => Penny!
PENNY => Jeff, no!
THE HOOD => Did you save them all this time, Jeff? Or did you leave someone behind?
JEFF => I didn't make you what you are.
THE HOOD => It's not me you have to convince. (motions his head toward the entrance of the room
JEFF => Leave my son out of this- (the Hood uses his powers to throw Jeff into the cage that Lady
LADY PENELOPE => Jeff!
ALAN => Dad! (Alan runs toward the closing cage door and reaches it right as it slams shut) Dad! Dad!
THE HOOD => I'm disappointed in you, Alan. I thought we were kindred spirits.
ALAN => Well, we're not. I'm Jeff Tracy's son.
THE HOOD => You certainly are.
JEFF => No!
LADY PENELOPE => Alan no! (The Hood uses his powers to throw Alan off to the side where he slams
JEFF => Alan!
TRANSOM => Come here, you little minx! (Tintin jumps up on a bar and flips to the other side while
TINTIN => Bye-bye.
JEFF => Alan, stay back.
THE HOOD => You want so desperately to walk in Daddy's footsteps. (uses his powers to lift Alan off the
JEFF => Let him go.
THE HOOD => Did you really think you could challenge me?
JEFF => Let him go, please.
LADY PENELOPE => Let him go.
JEFF => Please! Let him go! (the Hood tightens his hold of Alan and then releases him)
LADY PENELOPE => Alan! Are you all right?
JEFF => Alan, get out. Run!
ALAN => He's getting weaker. He can't last much longer.
JEFF => Neither can you! (Alan begins to climb up the Mole to reach the Hood) Alan, no! Look out! (The
THE HOOD => I'm glad you could be here to see this, Jeff. (steps on one of Alan's hands until he cries in
THE HOOD => Goodbye, Alan! (Steps on the other hand and Alan yells in pain) (Tintin runs into the room)
TINTIN => No!
THE HOOD => Ah,  (She uses her powers on him as well) Oh!
THE HOOD => Leave me, Alan. Leave me to die. (releases one hand from the railing) Like your father did.
ALAN => I don't want to save your life. (the Hood lets his other hand go, but Alan grabs it) But it's what we
THE HOOD => See you soon, Jeff.
PARKER =>  Now, that was definitely showing off.
VIRGIL => Hey, Scott.
SCOTT => Get him!
LADY PENELOPE => What did you put in these margaritas?
JEFF => It's a Tracy secret.
BRAINS => That's my boy! One more week and you're gonna be swimming like a F-f-f-D-d-d-
ALAN => Good job, Ferm.
TINTIN => So, what do you think?
ALAN => He's getting there. Whoa, Tintin! You're just really, um, blossoming.
TINTIN => Ew! Did you say "blossoming"? (smiles at him)
JEFF => Gather around everybody. I have an announcement to make. Tonight is a special
FERMAT => Mr. Tracy!
TINTIN => Thank you, sir. (Camera pans quickly over to Parker who is tearing up)
JEFF => Congratulations, Alan. No short cuts. You earned it. You all did.
PARKER => I'm not usually an emotional man, but sometimes even the toughest
VIRGIL =>  Hey, way to go,
JOHN => That's my boy, Alan! That's my brother. (Fermat and Alan are thrown into the pool by Scott,
JEFF =>  Yes, Madam President. I see. Of course, straightaway. Boys.
LADY PENELOPE => Of course it does. And quite right too.
JEFF => Thunderbirds are go!
LADY PENELOPE => Fast as you can, Parker.
PARKER => Certainly, milady.
BUSTED => Thunderbirds Are Go
