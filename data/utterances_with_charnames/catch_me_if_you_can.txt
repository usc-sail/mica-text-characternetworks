JOE SHAPE => If I give you another twenty, will you turn up the heat in here?
WARDEN GARREN => Don't pass him anything through the
HOLE- => Garren walks off, and Joe immediately starts to smile, looking around for a long BEAT as he stares at the cell door.
JOE SHAYE => Yoohoo. Hello? Is the lady of the house at home? Joe tries to control his excitement as he kneels down and looks through the metal slide hole.
JOE SHAYE => Jesus, Frank, you look terrible. I heard about French prisons, but this is positively barbaric. WE HEAR a sound come fr)dthe cell, and then heavy coughing. JO,E YE That doesn' t o d(rr4ood. I have a little cold my Help me.

JOE SHAYE => He's not breathing. I think he stopped breathing! Debbie Zane -
JOE SHAYE => What's happening to him? Garren and the Guard quickly move toward a sink, where they start to wash their hands. JOE SHAYE What are you doing?
JOE SHAYE- => He can't breath. You have to call a doctor.
FRANK => Okay, Joe...let's go home.
JACK WRIGHT => The New Rochelle Rotary Club has a history that goes back to 1859. In all those years, we have only inducted a handful of deserving men as lifetime members, an honor that has seen 187 names enshrined on the wall of honor. Tonight, we make it 188. So please stand, as I present my good friend, Frank William Abagnale. Applause all around as FRANK ABAGNALE SR. steps up to the MICROPHONE. He is handsome and impeccable groomed -- wearing a black suit and holding onto his plaque with two hands.
FRANK SR. => Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream. The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned, but the second mouse wouldn't quit. He struggled so hard,
PAULA => You're a better dancer than your father, Frankie. The girls don't know what they're in for.
FRANK SR. => Paula, show him the dance you were doing when we met.
PAULA => Who can remember?
FRANK SR. => The people in that little French Village were so happy to see Americans, that they decided to put on a show for us.
FRANK => I know the story, Dad.
FRANK SR. => So they cram two hundred soldiers into this tiny social hall, and the first person to walk on stage is your mother. And she starts to dance... Paula steps away from Frank, and she starts to dance a ballet, smiling as she tries to remember the steps. FRANK SR. It had been months since we had even seen a woman, and here's this blonde angel on stage -- and the men are literally holding their breath. And I turned to my buddies, and I said..
FRANK =>  I will not lea France without her. Paula spins around, accide1 49, ILLS HER GLASS OF WINE --
PAULA => Oh, shit, the rug! I b relieve I did that. Frankie, run /get a towel... As Frank runs off, Paula drops to her knees and scrubs the stain with the hem of her dress.
PAULA => This will never come out. She looks up at her husband.
PAULA => Whenever I dance for you, I get in trouble.
FRANK SR. => Wake up, Frank... it's eight-thirty. Frank opens his eyes, stares at his father.
FRANK => I overslept. Mom's gonna kill me.
FRANK SR. => It's okay. You don't have to go to school today.
FRANK => Is it snowing?
FRANK SR. => Do you own a black suit?
FRANK => A black suit? Why?
FRANK SR. => We have a vermportant meeting in the city.
someone's attention. => ply( l
FRANK SR. => Ma'am, open the door. Just open up, please, it's important. THE DOOR OPENS A CRACK AND DARCY, 40's, low cut blouse, a bagel in her hand, stares at Frank Sr.
DARCY => we don't open for half an hour.
FRANK SR. => What's your name, ma'am?
DARCY => Darcy.
FRANK SR. => Darcy, that's a pretty name. I'm in a bit of fix -- I need a suit for my kid. This is my son, Frank, he needs
DARCY => I'm sorry. We don't loan suits, and we're not open. As she closes the door, Frank Sr. takes a small GOLD NECKLACE OUT OF HIS POCKET, holds it up to the glass.
FRANK SR. => Is this yours, Darcy? I just found it in the parking lot? Darcy stares at the necklace through the door.
FRANK SR. => Slide over. You're gonna take me to Chase Manhattan Bank. Just head up to seventy-second and Madison, pull up to the front and park next to the fire hydrant. Frank looks back at his father.
FRANK => Dad...I don't know how to drive.
FRANK SR. => A little more gas -- now slip it into second. That's good, more clutch, now pull into this lane here -- slowly!
FRANK SR. =>  Don't honk at us you son of a bitch -- I'm teaching my kid to drive! You're doing fine, Frank, just pick a lane and slip it into third -- about one- o'clock -- push it hard.
< A => Frank slips it into third. FRANK SR_ Perfect! Now you got it! Look at you, Frank, t is your town -- you're goin s aight up Broadway!
FRANK SR. => Okay. Stop grinning. When I get inside you go back to the front seat and wait. Even if a cop comes and writes you a ticket, you don't move the car, understood?
FRANK => Dad... is this really gonna help?
FRANK SR. => You know why the Yankees always win, Frank?
FRANK => They have Mickey Mantle?
FRANK SR. => No. It's because the other teams can't stop staring at those damn pinstripes. Frank Sr. steps out from the Cadillac, grabs his briefcase. FRANK SR. Watch this, Frank. The manager of Chase Manhattan bank is about to open the door for your father. As Frank Sr. casually walks toward the doors of Chase Manhattan, the MANAGER rushes through the bank to open the doors for him.
LOAN OFFICER => You've owned stationery store for how man rs?
LOAN OF => Mr. Abagnale, we don' `)1y loan money to people who hav resolved business with the I.R.S..
FRANK SR. => That's just a misunderstanding. I hired the wrong guy to do my books, a mistake anyone could make. I wouldn't even consider that if I were you.
LOAN OFFICER => You want me to ignore the fact that the government is demanding two years back taxes?
FRANK SR. => My store is a landmark in New Rochelle. I have customers all over New Jersey.
LOAN OFFICER => Sir, you're not a customer of Chase Manhattan. We don't know you. I'm sure you're bank in New Rochelle...
FRANK SR. => My bank went out of business. Banks like this put them out of business. Frank Sr. leans in, lowers his voice. FRANK SR. Now I know I made a mistake, I admit that. But these people want blood -- they want my store -- they've threatened to put me in jail. This is America, right, I'm not a criminal. I'm a medal of honor winner, a lifetime member of the New Rochelle Rotary Club. All I'm asking you to do is help me beat these guys.
LFRX OFFICER => This is not estion of winning and losing. It, question of risk. I'm very sort
FRAN => You're the largest ion the world. Where's the fucking
SALESMAN => The Impala is parked right over there. Frank and his father glance toward an OLD, DENTED CHEVY IMPALA at the back of the lot.
SALESMAN => it was great doing business with you. THE SALESMAN gets in the CADILLAC and drives it toward the front of the car lot. Frank Sr. looks down at the CHECK in his hand.
FRANK SR. => Come on, Frank. Let's go return the suit. Debbie 7 ana - S
J P => ank laughs with him.
FRANK => I'm making pancakes.
FRANK SR. => We're not gonna eat pancakes for dinner on my son's sixteenth birthday. Frank turns to his father. FRANK SR. Why are you looking at me like that? You thought I forgot? Frank opens his BRIEFCASE, takes out a CHECKBOOK FROM CHASE MANHATTAN BANK. He walks over and hands it to Frank.
FRANK => But they turned down your loan?
FRANK SR. => Yeah. They all turned me down.
FRANK => So why open a bank account with them?
FRANK SR.. => Because one day you'll want something from these people -- a house, a car -- they have all the money. There's a hundred check ere, Frank, which means from i day on -- you're in
O FLL\ => THE IMPALA pulls up to the f the local public High School. Frank wears his BLUE WHITE PANTS as he gets out of the car and smiles r mother. Paula wears an OLD FUR COAT over her pajamas.
PAULA => See that, it's just a school. No different than Buckley. Frank reaches through the window of the car, takes the CIGARETTE out of his mother's mouth.
FRANK => You promised you were going to quit.
PAULA => Frankie, you don't have to wear the uniform here. Why don't you take the jacket off?
FRANK => I'm used to it. Debbie Zane - 5
FRANK => Is this Ms. Glasser's sixth period French? Some of the students laugh, most just turn back to their friends as Frank nervously adjusts his tie. A GIRL in the front row stares at Frank.
STUDENT => Are you the sub? Frank looks around for ` teacher, then slowly starts to
NOD_ => Frank walks toward the blac writes his name on the board -- MR. ABAGNALE. HE S ACK OF AN ERASER against the board to get the students a n.
GIRL => Chapter seven.
FRANK => Open your books to chapter eight, read quietly to yourselves. The classroom door swings open, and a frail, confused TEACHER walks in and motions to Frank.
TEACHER => Are you subbing for Roberta?
FRANK => Yes.
TEACHER => They sent for me -- they said they needed a sub. I rushed over here from Dixon.
FRANK => I always sub for Roberta.
TEACHER => I'll never come to Monroe again. You tell them not to call me! The WOMAN storms out, and Frank turns back to the students.
FRANK => I suggest you start reading people.
VICE-PRIN ROWN => Mr. and Mrs. Abagnale, 1 is not a question of your son's attendance.
PRINCIPAL EVANS => For the past week Frank has been teaching Ms. Glasser's French class.
PAULA => He what?
PRINCIPAL EVANS => Your son has been pretending to be a substitute teacher, lecturing the students, giving out homework.
VICE-PRINCIPAL BROWN => Ms. Glasser has been ill, and there was some confusion with the real sub -- we're still not sure what happened.
PRINCIPAL EVANS => Your son held a teacher-parent conference yesterday. He was planning a class field trip to a French bread factory in Trenton. Do you see the problem we have? Frank Sr. and Paula seem a bit confused.
PAULA => This is our fault, Principal Evans. Frank had been at Buckley since he was a little boy. We had to take him out for personal reasons, away from his friends -- you know how kids are. He's all alone here.
FRANK SR. => He's not alone. He has us.
FRANK => It's a fake.
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR => Excuse me?
FRANK => There's no crease in the paper.
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR => I don't understand.
FRANK => When your mom hands you a note to miss school, you put it in your pocket. And if it was in his pocket, where's the crease?
FRANK SR. => Excuse me. I have to go to work.
PRINCIPAL EVANS => Sir, we have no choice but to suspend Frank for one week, and transfer him out of French and into German.
FRANK SR. => You're not suspending anyone. if you go after my son I'll go before the school board and ask them who's minding the ste at Monroe High. I'll ask my4bbd friend Tom Walsh how it's po s' or a little kid to teach a Fr n ajZa, t ss for an entire week without tP incipal of the school knowing a i%- I might even mention the f t my son doesn't speak Frenc Frank closes his locker, sees FOUR CHEERLEADERS standing in front of him. The leader of the group, JOANNA, steps forward.
JOANNA => Are you that transfer from Buckley? Frank looks a bit confused as he stares at the girls.
FRANK => Yes.
JOANNA => My name is Joanna Carlson, and I was wondering if you were going to the Junior Prom?
FRANK => No. I don't have a date yet. My name is Frank Abagnale.
JOANNA => Frank, do you think you could buy my' friends and I some beer before the dance? All the other guys are afraid to try.
FRANK => I'm only sixteen. How could I buy you beer?
JOANNA => If you're old enough to teach French, you're old enough to buy beer.
FRANK => Mom, I'm home. Nobody answers, and Fk'"slowly walks toward the back bedroom door, which is closed. Frank's about to knock when tht b om door suddenly opens, and Paula walks out with JACK W - the Rotary Club President -- who wears a tailored ck suit. Paula wears a dress and holds a tray of food.
PAULA => That's all there is, two bedrooms, but we're getting used to it. Frankie, you remember Dad's friend Jack Wright from the club, he came by looking for your father -- I was giving him a tour of the apartment.
JACK WRIGHT => Very spacious, Paula.
FRANK => Dad's at work. Frank stares at Jack, who walks over and picks up his HAT off the chair.
JACK WRIGHT => You look more like your old man every day. Thanks for the sandwich, Paula. I'll see ya later.
FRANK => Wait. Frank walks to the couch, picks up a small ROTARY PIN that is lying on the cushions. He holds it up to Jack.
JACK WRIGHT => Thank you, Frank. That's the President's pin. I'd be in big trouble if I lost that. Jack clips the pin to his jacket, turns and walks out the door.
PAULA => Are you hungry, Frankie? I'll make you a sandwich. Paula walks into the )Efien, opens the refrigerator and starts making a sandw PAWcont ' d) Jack wanted to t ob ness with your father. He sa' we should sue the government, a 's not legal what they're do us. Why aren't you saying anyth Frank stares at his mother, who continues to make his sandwich.
PAULA => You're not going to tell him, are you? Paula walks over to her son, her hands shaking as she hands him a sandwich.
FRANK => No.
PAULA => That'sright. There's nothing to tell.I'mgoing outfor a few hours, visitsomeold friends from the tennis club.Andwhen I get home we'll all
PAULA => Do you need some money, Frankie, a few dollars to buy some record albums? Here, take five dollars. Paula holds out five dollars, and Frank walks toward her, reaches up and takes the cigarette out of her mouth.
FRANK => You promised you were going to quit.
FRANK => This is a 925 sterlihk er Waldmann ballpoint pen V a two- color twist action top. Just turn it
WOMAN => They have them in the city for six. As the woman walks out of the store, Frank Sr. comes running out of his office, which doubles as the stockroom. He holds a letter in his hand.
FRANK SR. => It's over. I did it, Frank. The sons of bitches have called off the dogs -- read it and weep. I beat the United States government. Take a look at that. Frank Sr. hands Frank a letter.
FRANK => Does this mean we can move home?
FRANK SR. => We're gonna move back here, Frank, get a new house, a new car --
FRANK => A red Cadillac with white interior.
FRANK SR. => It's gonna take a little time, but we're gonna get it all back --every fur coat, eve goddamn piece of silver! Com o help me lock up. We're going tg4 brace!

BARTENDER => I need to see the kid's I.D..
FRANK SR. => This kid is the head salesman in my company. He's twenty-two and he's making five bills a week, so just bring the drinks and mind your business. Frank and his father sit at a small table in the middle of the bar. Frank looks uncomfortable as his father lights a cigar.
FRANK => Maybe I should wait in the car.
FRANK SR. => Are you afraid of these men? Look at the way, they sit, the way they dress, the way they drink. What are they, railway men? Cargo loaders? Those men haven't earned the right to judge us. I beat Uncle Sam, what have they ever done? The WAITRESS brings o the drinks, and Frank Sr. quickly downs both shots. He ak DIME out of his pocket and sets it on the table. FRANSR. %cont d) Frank, I wa nt you that dime and go put it in th u x. Pick something loud. We're ating. Frank glances to the bar, where the MEN are quietly watching the-TV. The JUKEBOX is directly under the television. FRANK SR. You know who I like? Lesley Gore.
FRANK => Dad... they're watching TV.
FRANK SR. => Yes. But in a moment they'll be listening to Lesley Gore. We're gonna teach the drunks to mind their manners.
FRANK => I think they know I'm not eighteen.
FRANK SR. => People only know what you tell them.
MAN #1 => Don't play that thing, kid. Frank nervously stands alt " ukebox. Some of the men have gotten off their stools drinks in hand.
MAN #2 => We asked you not to' , kid. The President is abou Gd ke a speech. Frank looks toward his father, who sits back in his chair, smoking and smiling. Frank's hand shakes as he reaches out, drops the dime into the jukebox.
MAN #1 => We're not gonna tell you again. Step away from the jukebox.
FRANK SR. => Why you bothering the kid? You got a problem, come bother me. Frank watches as TWO DRUNKS walk toward his father. They both hold PITCHERS OF BEER in their hands. FRANK SR. Hit the button, Frank. You hit that goddamn button!
JUDGE LARKI => Would the boy step forward and state his name for the record. Frank is seated in the middle of the courtroom -- a backpack on the floor at his feet. Frank slowly walks toward the bench.
FRANK => Frank William Abagnale Jr.
JUDGE LARKIN => Frank, the court apologizes for pulling you out of school this morning. Are you aware of the fact that your parents have filed for divorce? Frank glances at his mother, then slowly shakes his head "no."
FRANK => One ticket to Grand Central, please.
TICKET CLERK => Three dollars and fifty cents.
FRANK => Can I write you a check?
JOE SHAYE => Frank, this is Agent Amdursky and Agent Fox. They'll be helping with the extradition. Joe puts the handcuffs on Frank, who can barely stay on his feet as he slowly turns to Warden Garren.
FRANK => Your wife is sleeping with one of the guards. Just thought you should know.
JOE SHA => Just sit back and get table. We leave for the airpor nine hours.

FRANK => What's your name?
ASHLEY => Ashley.
FRANK => You do me this favor, Ashley, and I'll give you this sterling silver Waldmann pen. It's German. What do you say? Frank takes the PEN out of his pocket.
ASHLEY => I feel so bad. I'm really not supposed to take the check. How about if I just loan you a few dollars myself? Ashley takes some money out of her own pocket.
FRANK => That's okay, Ashley. I'll find my way to Chase Manhattan.
BILL. => Frank follows the Pilot into the 'air, seesthe hotel MANAGER rushing over to greet him. The entirelobby seems to be focussed on the Pilot, with BELLMEN runningover to carry 0; his bags -- the FLIGHT ATTENDANTS following his every move. Frank turns to an aging BELLMAN.
FRANK => Excuse me, do you know that pilot?
BELLMAN => He's just one of those airline jerks. Just because you fly at thirty thousand feet, doesn't make you God. Frank watches as the Pilot walks into the elevator, the Flight Attendants by his side.

FRANK => Yes, Sir.
MULLIGAN => Well you're in luck, son. Because I was one of the best.

MULLIGAN => You can have it, Frank. It expired five years ago.
FRANK => What about your I.D. badge? Do you have an extra one I could borrow?

FRANK => Frank Williams, Pan Am. Thanks for giving me a lift.

BANS => WE SEE rows of desks, chairs, cou and cash drawers -- everything you could possibly find at a bank. The AUCTIONEER stands in front of a room filled with BANKERS and BUSINESSMEN in dark suits.
AUCTIONEER => Our next item up for bid is also fromtheJersey National foreclosure. Thisisa micker encoder, a machine usedtoencode bank checks. Do I haveanopening bid? In the audience, Frank, dressed in a suit, smiles as he raises his paddle.
FRANK => Five dollars. Debbie Zane - 5
FRANK => Happy birthday, Dad. Frank turns to face his son, who is standing in front of a RED CADILLAC that still has the sticker in the window. The two men stare at each other for a long BEAT, and then embrace in the middle of the lot.
FRANK SR. => Jesus, look at you? My son the birdman. That is some uniform, Frank.
FRANK => I bought you a Cadillac. Frank motions to the car, holds up the keys. K ission. She goes s an hour. It btj speedometer. Frank Sr.
FRANK S => She's beautiful. Only\ @nna get myself another white on r already ordered it. You keep that one, Frank,
FRANK => I went by the store today. Since when do you close on a Friday?
FRANK SR. => I had to close the store for awhile. It's all about timing, Frank, the goddamn government knows that. They hit you when you're down, and I wasn't gonna let them take it from me. So I just shut the doors myself, called their bluff.
FRANK => I can get you money, whatever you need. We can buy ten stores.
FRANK SR. => No. It's better this way. I'm laying' low for awhile, letting them have their fun. It's just a stationery store -- sooner or later they'll forget about me.
FRANK => Have you talked to Mom?
FRANK SR. => She's so stubborn, your mother. But I won't let her go without a fight. I've been fighting for her since the day we met.
FRANK => Out of all those soldiers, you were the one that took her home.
FRANK SR. => That's right. Two hundred men were sitting in th' little social hall watching he d ce. What was the name of tha d I/ ..il lage? Montpelier.
FRANK S => I didn't speak a word six weeks later she was A WOMAN PULLS UP IN AN OLD FORD AND HONKS FOR FRANK SR.. She smiles and waves at him through the window, and he waves back. FRANK SR. Shit. I have to go, Frank.
FRANK => I was hoping I could buy you a steak.
FRANK SR. => Jesus, tonight is no good. That's my friend, Darlene. She's cooking me dinner for my birthday. She used to be the pastry chef at Elaines. Why don't you come home with us?
FRANK => No, I should probably get out to the airport. I'm flying the red eye tonight.
FRANK SR. => Where are you going?
FRANK => Dad, I'm serious about what I said. I can get you money --whatever you need.
FRANK SR. => Just tell me where you're going. I bet it's someplace warm.
FRANK => Yeah. Hawaii.
FRANK SR. => Hawaii. My son is going to Hawaii tonight. The x t of us really are suckers.
CLOSE ON => A SLIDE PROJECTOR -- the circular tray turning clockwise as an AGENT JOE SHAYE stands at the front of the room addressing
JOE SHAYE => John Doe 2172 is a paperhanger who started on the East Coast. During the last few weeks 2172 has developed a new form of check fraud, which I'm calling "the float". Next slide. The slide doesn't change. JOE SHAYE Next slide, please.
FBI AGENT => The remote thing is broken. You'll have to do it by hand. Joe reaches in and turns the slide. JOE SHAYE What he's doing is opening checking accounts all over the country, then changing the micker ink routing numbers on the bottom of those checks.
CLOSE ON => THE FACES OF THE FIVE FBI AGENTS, looking bored as they all listen to Joe, having no idea what he's talking about. Some of the agents are yawning, while other are doodling at their desks. JOE SHAYE This is a map of the 12 branches of the U.S. Federal Reserve. The optical scanners at t bank read the numbers on the bott a check -- then ship the ch c}f,? to the
SPEC___ => Joe, for those of with bank fraud, wo telling us what the h talking about?
JOE SHAYE => The East Coast branches are numbered seven through twelve, the midwest four, five, and six...
JOE SHAYE => Yes. And if you change a number one to a number nine -- a check cashed in New York won't be sent to the East Coast Reserve -- but will be re- routed all the way to California. The bank won't know the check has bounced for two weeks, which means
JOE SHAYE => Sean, I was hoping to get-some back- up on this.
AMDURS => .I'm wearing a red nd high heels, running through park and chasing these two Puerto Rican's with a suitcase filled with marijuana and I reach for my radio to call for back-up, but the radio is stuck in my bra... Joe turns up the volume on the radio, keeps his eyes on the road as he drives.
AMDURSKY => That's a funny story. People always laugh at that story.
JOE SHAYE => Let me ask you something, Amdursky. if you had so much fun working undercover, why did you transfer into bank fraud?
AGENT AMDURSKY => I didn't transfer. I was demoted.  Demoted is the wrong word. It was more like-punished. I screwed up in the field.
JOE SHAYE => What about you, Mr. Fox? Did you fuck up in the field and get punished?
FOX => No. I've never worked in the field before. I was in the L.A. public relations office, but we were shut down after the riots.
JOE SHAYE => That's just great. I ask for backup, they drag the bottom of the Pacific.
AMDURSKY => Can I ask you mething, Joe? How come you're o erious all the time?
JOE SHAYE => Does it bother you, Mr. Fox?
FOX => A little, I guess.
JOE SHAYE => Would you guys like to hear me tell a joke?
AGENT AMDURSKY => Yeah. We'd love to hear a joke from you.
JOE SHAYE => Knock Knock.
AGENT AMDURSKY => Who's there?
JOE SHAYE => Go fuck yourselves.
MOTEL OWNER => He's been here two weeks, written lots of checks. The one that bounced was for twenty dollars, and he took care of it right away.
JOE SHAYE => Nobody is goin to blame you. The bank called u He's probably not the man we' oking for.
ER => I don't want m-Y u Comers harassed. He took care of ' o '
JOE SHA => Do you have any of th 1 ( ys he's written you?
MOTEL OWNER => He gave me one yesterday. The owner takes a check out of the register, hands it to Joe. Joe stares at the check for a BEAT, slowly starts to smile.
JOE SHAYE => I don't believe it. You guys stay here, watch the front.
AMDURSKY => Stay here? This guy's a check forger, a goddamn paperhanger. He doesn't even carry a gun.
FOX => Why can't we go with you, Joe?
JOE SHAYE => Just be quiet and watch the front. And if you're good, I'll take you both for ice cream when we're finished.
ROOM 212 => at the end of the second floor hallway, the DO NOT DISTURB SIGN hanging off the door. Joe slowly makes his way down the hall, passing a MAID wh 's about to scream -- until he shows her his badge and vio y motions for her to hide inside a room. Joe creeps along the walYh s gun straight out, his face covered in sweat. He free Jow he hears a door creak, his breathing labored as the s of ROOM 212 slowly swings open and Frank walks into the ly u He wears a dark brown suit and holds a black suitcase
FI => Freeze! FBI! Don't you move! Put your hands on your head or I'll shoot you! Frank slowly turns to face Joe. The two men stare at each other for a BEAT_
FRANK => Relax, buddy, you're late. My name is Johnson, Secret Service. Our boy just tried to climb out the window -- my partner has him cuffed in the alley downstairs.
JOE SHAYE => Secret Service? What are you talking about? Keep your hands in the air.
FRANK => You think the FBI are the only ones tracking this guy. We've been following a paper trail for months, almost had him in New York. Would you mind taking that gun out of my face, it makes me nervous.
JOE SHAYE => Let me see some identification.
FRANK => Here. Take my whole wallet. Frank throws his wallet to Joe, who catches it with his free hand, but doesn't open it.
FRANK => You want my gun, too? Come over here and take my gun! Frank opens his jacket, but not wide enough for Joe to see that he's not armed.
F => Are you gonna e that weapon? We're supposed a on the same team. Joe hesitates, then slowly louW6Xs`J`3,. gun and holsters it.
JOE SHAYE => I'm sorry. I got a little carried away. I didn't expect Secret Service on this.
FRANK => Counterfeiting is our thing.
JOE SHAYE => I know. I know. I just wasn't expecting...
FRANK => Don't worry about it.  This is his typewriter. I'm gonna go lock it in my trunk. Do me a favor and guard his room for a minute. Frank starts moving toward the back stairwell.
FRANK => And yell down to my partner in the alley -- tell him I'm on my way. Frank starts to walk down back stairwell. He looks back at Joe, who stands at the front of room 212.
FRANK => What's your name, anyway?
JOE SHAYE => Joe Shaye.
FRANK => Tough luck, Joe. Five minutes earlier and you would have landed yourself a pretty good collar. Frank starts walking down the stairs.
JOE SHAYE => Wait. ,4back to Joe. Frank stops, slowly ty
FRANK => Hang onto it for a pu`% , I trust you.
JOE SHAYE => Thanks, Sean. It was my call all the way.
JOE SHAYE => Not really. I made a mistake.
JOE SHAYE => Yeah, but I'm gonna get this one. The worst thi a paperhanger can do is show is I saw him, I heard his voice -- r s nothing for him to hide beiin (n
JOE SHAYE => what position is that?
JOE SHAYE => Hey, Sean, you want to hear a joke?
JOE SHAYE => Knock knock.
FRANK => Do you have any ketchup, Richard?
WAITER => It's in the little bowl, Mr. Williams.
FRANK => Thanks. Here ya go. Keep the change. Frank takes a crumpled fifty dollar bill out of his pocket, hands it to the waiter.
WAITER => Thank you very much, Mr. Williams. you want some`5'v
WAIT O => I would, but my sh' over. I'm going home to my ki thank you for asking, Mr. Willi d merry Christmas.
FRANK => Merry Christmas.
JOE SHAYE => is looking through a giant PRINT BOOK -- tediously searching for a match. Joe is alone in the fingerprint lab, where a pathetic looking Christmas tree sits in the corner of the room. The phone rings, and Joe quickly answers.
JOE SHAYE => This is Shaye. Merry Christmas.
FRANK => Hello, Joe.
JOE SHAYE => Who is this?
FRANK => Johnson, Secret Service. Joe sits up at his desk, grabs a pencil and paper.
JOE SHAYE => John Doe 2172?
FRANK => I've been trying to track you down for a couple of hours. Did you know that most people in the FBI have no idea who you are or what you do?
JOE SHAYE => What do you want? happened out li'n>Zo ngeles .
JOE => Fuck you. Don't yo ize to me. I'm the one that's Rn t you in jail.
FRANK => Joe, do you always work on Christmas Eve? Joe looks around the room before he answers.
JOE SHAYE => I volunteered, so that men with families could go home early.
FRANK => You were wearing a wedding ring in L.A.. I thought maybe you had a family?
JOE SHAYE => No. I've never been married.
FRANK => How come?
JOE SHAYE => You want to talk to me, let's talk face to face.
FRANK => Okay. I'm at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan. Suite 3113. Joe starts to write this down, then suddenly stops himself.
JOE SHAYE => You think you're gonna get me again, don't you? You'd love for me to send twenty agents out on Christmas Eve to barge into that hotel, break down doors so you can make a fool out of me again?
FRANK => Joe, I'm sorry if I made a fool out of you.
J SHAYS => Goddamn it, o t you feel sorry for me. The tru h knew it was you. Maybe I didn 1 {he trigger, but I knew.
FRANK => People only know wh r,y` iV tell them.
JOE SHAYE => Then tell me something. How did you know I wouldn't look in the wallet?
FRANK => The same reason the Yankees always win. Nobody can keep their eyes off the pinstripes.
JOE SHAYE => The Yankees win because they have Mickey Mantle.
FRANK => I have to go. I'm catching a flight in two hours. Merry Christmas, Joe.
JOE SHAYE => You didn't call to apologize, did you John Doe?
7 FRANK => What do you mean?
JOE SHAYE => You've got no one else to call. Joe hangs up the phone. He cups his hands to his face, then stares at a picture of his WIFE AND DAUGHTER -- which sits on the desk in front of him.
NEW AC => Just take a deposit counter, then fill in ou wish to the amounty
FRANK => I don't need to fill in my account number?
JOE SHAYE => I'm calling it "The Switch." Next slide. The slide doesn't change. JOE SHAYE
JOE SHAYE => The bank scanners read the micker ink before they read pen ink. So even though those deposit slips are filled out correctly, each person who made a deposit that day was actually putting money into his account.
JOE SHAYE => Forty-six thousand, four hundred and' twelve dollars. It was the second largest bank robbery in the history of Las Vegas.
FRANK => What's the fuel consumption of a 707 in flight?
MULLIGAN => Kid, I'm really not in the mood for this today. That damn Skywayman is driving me crazy. There was another article.
FRANK => Who's The Sk an? Mulligan hands Frank _ f the NEW YORK TIMES.
UG => Some nut flying posing as a Pan Am has devoted a weekl Frank stares down at the TIMES, h yes wide as he stares at the headline: SKYWAYMAN VISITS WASHINGTON: ELUSIVE PHONY
FRANK => The Skywayman...
MULLIGAN => I keep telling them it's not my problem. He doesn't fly on Pan Am planes -- he flies on everybody else. The damn paper is in love with this clown -- they call him the James Bond of the sky.
FRANK => Did you say James Bond? Debbie Zane - 5
FRANK => And you're sure this is the suit?
SALESMAN => Positive. That'.s the same.one he wore in the movie.
FRANK => Okay. I'll take three.
S SMAN => Now all you a is one of those little Fore gny-ts cars he drives.
FOX => Joe, I got something! Joe rushes over to Agent Fox, who is holding up TWO SETS OF
FOX => I was looking through the wanted criminal file, and there it was! Look at that! Joe takes the file from Fox and opens it.
JOE SHAYE => The Skywayman. Holy shit, a perfect match.
AMDURSKY => They describe The Skywayman as a thirty-year-old -- dark hair --six- feet -- same fucking guy!
JOE SHAYE => It doesn't make any sense. A thirty- year-old has to register for the draft, which means his prints have to be here.
FOX => Maybe there's a reason he didn't register. He could have a wooden leg for all we know. Maybe he was born in Peru and he's not an American
JOE SHAYE => Maybe he's not thirty. Somebody call New York, get a list of juvenile runaways from the NYPD. TEN FBI AGENTS have surrounded a 4 /STORY HOME IN LONG ISLAND. Joe Shaye, wearing a black hat and black overcoat, is knocking on the door with Amdursky and Fox. Paula answers with a cigarette in her hand.
JOE SHAYE => Good morning, ma'am, we're the FBI Agents who called.
PAULA => Yes. I've been waiting. I hope you're all hungry. I made biscuits-
PAULA => My husband is a lawyer.
JOE SHAYE => Of course, Ma'am. Do you have a current address for your ex-husband, Frank Abagnale?
PAULA => No. He moves around a lot these days. How are those biscuits?
AMDURS KY => Very good.
JOE SHAYE => Ma'am, you filed a police report last year for a juvenile runaway named Frank Ana1e, Jr.
PAULA => He's forging checks? That's why you're here?
JOE SHAYE => What he's doing is a federal offense.
PAULA => A young boy has to eat, has to have a place to sleep. What do you want him to do? His father can't help him. Paula gets off the couch and grabs her purse.
PAULA => I'm working part-time now at the Church. Just tell me how much he owes and I'll pay you back. Paula takes out her CHECKBOOK.
JOE SHAYE => So far it's about two million dollars.
LUCY => Yes, Sir, that's him. But I didn't know he was sixteen! I swear to God I didn't know! Joe gets out of the cy , -61oses the door on Lucy and smiles at Amdursky and Fox. We got him. Frank is wearing his James Bond s1'/as she pulls up to the airport in a German sports car. He parks the car and jumps out of the convertible, leaving the keys in the ignition.
FRANK => Dear Dad. I'm no longer an airline pilot for Pan Am. I'm now an FBI Agent working undercover for the
FRANK \1 => This is a micker encodifi achine. It's what banks use to print numbers on checks. I collect them.
WOMAN #2 => Very cool. Where's the party tonight?
FRANK => I'm doing fondue at my place.
CLOSE ON => A bubbling FONDUE POT with skewers lining the rim. The apartment is packed with men and women who are drinking, smoking pot, and eating fondue.
R.B.WOMAN #1 => Frank, this is great fondue.
FRANK => Thanks. Did you see my new phonograph system? It's reel-to-reel, the best sound system you can buy. Frank motions to the phonograph system in the living room, with giant speakers against the walls.
FRANK => Thirty-one. Come on, everyone, I'll show you my closet!
FRANK => Okay, you guyeady? Frank throws open his"c doors, revealing FOUR ROWS of SUITS, all different st all arranged by color.
FRANK  no => Some of those Manhattan le suits were three hundred dollars. And those shoes are Stacy-Adams slip-ons.
YOUNG DOCTOR => These bottles need to be labeled when you pick them up. Do you realize what would happen if they got mixed up -- do you understand how dangerous this is? Don't stand there crying, just nod your head and tell me you won't do it again! Brenda nods her head, quickly walks away from the Doctor and sits behind the RECEPTION DESK. She buries her head and starts to write a letter, her body still sobbing as Frank walks up to her.
FRANK => Are you okay? Brenda looks up at Frank, her eyes and nose puffy from crying. She covers her mouth when she talks.
BRENDA => i He told me to ck up the blood, so I did. He nev told me to label it. Brenda.
FRANK => Brenda, I wouldn't worr-out it. These Doctors don't know everything.
BRENDA => It's my first week. I think they'.re going to fire me.
FRANK => No. Nobody will fire you. I'll bet you're good at your job.
BRENDA => No, I'm not.
FRANK => I'll bet if I asked you to check the status of my friend, Lance Applebaum, you could do that in a second. He hurt his foot tonight. Brenda grabs a chart, starts to read it out loud.
BRENDA => Mr. Applebaum fractured his ankle. Doctor Ashland is treating him in exam seven.
FRANK => See that. No problem. Brenda smiles, covering her mouth.
BRENDA => This is the emergency chart. See the blue star, that means the patient has been diagnosed. After he's treated, we put a red circle here.
FRANK => How do you like those braces? Brenda looks embarrassed as she stares at Frank.
BRENDA => I guess they',okay.
FRANK => Mine were bottoms. I h 'e(E hhem. I still have my mouth qua
BRENDA => You have really nice teeth.
FRANK => And you have a pretty smile. Brenda tries not to smile, shaking her head and covering her face.
FRANK => I'm serious. I think those braces look really good on you. Brenda starts to blush as she continues to write her letter.
FRANK => What are you writing?
BRENDA => A letter to Ringo.
FRANK => What does it say?
BRENDA => I can't tell you. I'm embarrassed.
FRANK => Come on. What does it say?
BRENDA => It says I love him. Pretty stupid, right. Ringo Starr is never going to read my letter. Frank stares at Brenda, starts to smile as she puts her letter in a drawer.
FRANK => Brenda, do you know if they're hiring here at the h ital?
GRANGER => Harvard Medical School, top of your class, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Peace Corps volunteer in North Africa. A pretty impressive resume, Doctor Connors? Why do you want to work here?
FRANK => I came to Atlanta to relax, to get away from my practice for a year. But to be honest, I'm a little bored out at River Bend.
GRANGER => Unfortunately, the only thing I need is an emergency room supervisor for my midnight to eight shift, someone to baby-sit six interns and thirty nurses. But I doubt you'd be interested in that.
FRANK => Would I get to pick my own nurses?
DOCTOR GRANGER => Doctor Connors, here is your temporary license, which allows you to practice medicine in the state of Georgia for up to one year. And now let me be the first to say, welcome to Marietta General.
FRANK => Brenda Strong? He smiles at Brenda, who covers her mouth as she smiles back.
BRENDA => Here.
FRANK => Doctor Paul Ashland.
DOCTOR ASHLAND => Sir... will you be taking role every night?
FRANK => Yes. And if you're going to be late, I suggest you bring a note.
(FLIRTING => Good evening, tJr Connors.
FRANK => Button your shirt, M can see you bra strap. i is s a hospital, not a sororit
DR. KILDARE => Any change in the patient, Doctor Marks?
DOCTOR MARKS => Doctor Kildare, I think we should try the shock therapy before it's too late. Frank sits alone in his apartment eating popcorn and watching DR. KILDARE on TV.
DOCTOR KILDARE => Doctor White, do you concur?
DOCTOR WHITE => Yes. I concur.
BRENDA => Doctor Connors, you need to sign these. Brenda walks in and hands him the clipboard. Frank starts to scribble on the charts, the way Doctor's scribble out prescriptions.
BRENDA => Do you notice anything different about me, Doctor Connors?
BRENDA => I kept trying to show '4 ) l night.
FRANK => Did it hurt when they took them off? Mine felt so weird after.
BRENDA' => I keep rubbing my tongue over them. I can't stop. It's so slippery.
FRANK => It feels good, doesn't it?
BRENDA => Yes_ It feels incredible. Frank leans toward Brenda, gently starts to kiss her. As the passion increases WE HEAR the HOSPITAL P.A. SYSTEM.
P.A. OPERATOR => Doctor Connors, please come to Emergency. Doctor Connors to Emergency. Frank continues to kiss Brenda.
BRENDA => Shouldn't you go?
FRANK => There's a staff Doctor in the emergency ward.
BRENDA => What if he's in surgery?
FRANK => Do you really think I have to go?
EMERGENCY N => In here, Doctor Connors. Frank walks toward a closed curtain, stands in front of a bed and forces himself to look-'He sees a blood splattered sheet and three young INTERNS standing over the leg of an
FRANK => Well, what do we have here?
DOCTOR ASHLAND => Bicycle accident. A fracture of the tibia, about five inches below the patella. Frank stares at the boy's face, trying not to look at the open wound.
FRANK => Doctor Hollis, do you concur?
DOCTOR HOLLIS => Concur with what, Sir?
FRANK => What Doctor Ashland just said.
FRANK => So you concur?
DOCTOR HOLLIS" => Well, I'm not sure we can...
DOCTOR ASHLAND => I think we should take an x-ray, then stitch him up and put him in a walking cast.
DOCTOR HO => I blew it, didn't I? Wh idn't I concur? I panicked!
BRENDA => He wrote me back. Ringo wrote me back! Doctor Connors, come quick! I got a letter from Ringo Starr, he signed his name and said I was his biggest fan!
BRENDA => I bought you a present. Brenda hands him wrapped present.
BRENDA => Open it. Frank quickly opens the box, takes out a TINY GOLD DOCTOR'S
BRENDA => Now when you're walki nd the hospital, you'll feel l"the real thing. She pins the Cadecus on his lapel, and Frank can't help but smile.
FRANK => Brenda, I want to go away with you. I'll take you anywhere you want to go.
BRENDA => I haven't really been anywhere.
FRANK => Just name the place, and we can go. Africa, Egypt, it doesn't matter.
BRENDA => Can we go to Liverpool.
FRANK => Where's Liverpool?
BRENDA => It's where the Beatles are from in Europe.
FRANK => Okay. We'll go to Liverpool.
BRENDA => You're joking, right. We're not really going to Liverpool, are we?
FRANK => Brenda, how would you like to be head nurse at the hospital? is
BRENDA => But I'm not a nurse. I'm a candy striper.
BRE => They'll laugh at m k, please don't make me the h e. Promise me you won't do that, t even give a shot.
FRANK => Just think about it, Brenda. You and I could run this hospital one day.
JOE SHAYE => I just need to go inside and take a quick look around?
LANDLORD => He's at work, so search all you want. But if you find any money in there, it belongs to me. Debbie Zane - 5
the room. => WE SEE a black and white picture of Paula and Frank Sr. sitting on the front of a U.S. ARMY TANK. Joe takes Frank Sr.'s black briefcase off the shelf and flips it open. He reaches inside and pulls out a stack of POSTCARDS -- all sent by Frank to his father. Joe smiles as he flips over the postcard, stares down at a picture of CLARK GABLE and
JOE SHAYE => He's in Atlan Sean! No, I'm not coming back o ashington. I'm going straight to G and I'll meet the team they hit, I'm out of dimes. Sean, w 3, I'm out of dimes! Frank and Brenda are lying in bbt(c.ther, staring at each other in the ceiling mirrors.
FRANK => It's okay. You don't have to cry.
BRENDA => I'm sorry, I just can't do this.
FRANK => Brenda, it's okay. I don't care about you being a virgin. I can wait.
BRENDA => I want to sleep with you. I really do. Brenda sits up, starts getting dressed.
BRENDA => I haven't told you the truth. I'm not a virgin. I had an abortion two years ago. My parents found out and kicked me out of the house. Brenda covers her face with a pillow, starts to cry.
BRENDA => I had an abortion, and they said I wasn't their daughter anymore.
FRANK => It's okay.
BRENDA => Then a few months ago they apologized and said I was their daughter, but I couldn't come home for awhile. I'm so sorry, Frank, please don't be mad.
BREN 10 => I ask them all the but they won't let me come h M Y Da d' a lawyer, and he and this contract. He calls it a al agreement.
FRANK => What if you were engaged to a doctor, would that change anything? Brenda removes the pillow from her face, stares at Frank.
BRENDA => What?
FRANK => What if I went to your parents, spoke to your father and asked his permission to marry you?
BRENDA => Don't tease me, Frank.
FRANK => I'm not teasing.
BRENDA => You would go home with me to New Orleans?
FRANK => We can leave right now, never come back.
FBI AGENT => We're clear. It's empty. There's a fondue pot in the kitchen, bean bag chairs in the living room. Joe walks over to the wall -- stares at the framed HARVARD MEDICAL OkHOOL DIPLOMA.
JOE SHAYE => Okay. Kick it in. The Agents kick down the door, and Joe Shaye walks into the office, stares at an electric typewriter that is humming on the desk.

ROBERT => Doctor Connors, are you a Lutheran?
FRANK => Yes, Sir. I'm a Lutheran.
CAROL => Have you been to New Orleans before, Doctor?
FRANK => No, Ma'am. This is my first time. And please, call me Frank.
ROBERT => Frank, would you like to say grace? Frank stares at Brend ah her parents, who bow their heads. He hesitates for a B T, WE SEE that he has no idea how to say grace. ROBETc `'''c d) Unless you're not i V able. Brenda peeks at Frank, who close 2 )eyes and bows his head.
FRANK => Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream. The first mouse gave up and drowned, but the second mouse struggled so hard that he churned that cream into butter -- and he walked out. Amen. They all lift their heads, clearly impressed. Robert turns to Frank and smiles.
CAROL => Amen. That was beautiful. Frank turns to Brenda, gives her a wink.
FRANK => Who is this?
ROBERT => President Johnson.
FRANK => Right. That's very good, Sir.
ROBERT => It's just a hobby. Every Sunday night I go into the garage, pretend I'm an artist. Sometimes I stay in there for hours, hiding from the world, making a fool out of myself.
FRANK => No, Sir. You are an artist.
ROBERT => What about you, Frank? Where do you go when you need to hide?
ROBERT => Have you decided whic want to work at here in
FRANK => To be honest, I've been thinking about getting back into law.
ROBERT => What do you mean? Are you a lawyer or a doctor?
FRANK => Before I went to medical school I passed the bar in California. I practiced law for a year, then decided to try my hand at pediatrics.
ROBERT => A doctor and a lawyer. I'd say Brenda hit the jackpot. Where did you go to law school?
FRANK => Berkeley.
ROBERT => Berkeley. Well, now she's hit the Irish Sweepstakes. Would you be interested in coming to work for an old man who barely made his way through Stanford. My office is desperate for Assistant Prosecutors.
FRANK => You would give me a job?
ROBERT => If you're going to marry Brenda, it's the least I can do.
FRANK => What would I have to do to take the bar here in New Orleans?
CLOSE ON => BERKELEY TRANSCRIPTS, co e e with Berkeley Logo and stationery. Frank hands m th oc ents to a WOMAN sitting behind a desk, who hands him WUISIANA BAR EXAM.
BAR EXAMI => Good luck, Mister Conno
JOE SHAYE => Look at that. They show movies on planes now. What's next? Frank and Joe stare at a small MOVIE SCREEN thirty rows in front of them.
FRANK => Are you gonna eat that eclair?
JOE SHAYE => Yeah. I'm gonna eat it later.
FRANK => Do you want to split it?
JOE SHAYE => No. Joe moves his eclair away from Frank. JOE SHAYE You know what I could never figure out, Frank? How you cheated on the bar exam in Louisiana.
FRANK => What's the difference?
JOE SHAYE => Did you have somebody else take the test for you?
FRANK => I'm going to prison for a long time, Joe? What's t)1 difference?

RAYMOND BURR => But if you were at your office on the day of the murder, Mr. Darius, then how could you know your wife had left the gate open? Your honor, ladies and gentleman of the jury, this is irrefutable evidence that the defendant is lying!

BRENDA => Stop teasing me, Frank. You're Frank Connors, right? You're Frank Connors and you're 28-years-old. Why would you lie to me? Brenda turns to Frank, trying not to get upset.

MR. HENDRICKS => Ladies, quiet down, please. As you all know, Pan Am has sent 'a pilot here to interview prospective stewardesses for a new Summer internship program. This is Captain Taylor, and he'll be talking to you today. Frank stands in front of the girls, who suddenly get very quiet.
FRANK => Judy, what does the word "abroad" mean to you?
JUDY => When I hear the word abroad, I think of crossing the ocean and traveling to distant lands.
FRANK => Thank you.
FRANK => And what's this, Monica?
MONICA => The wing.
FRANK => Very good- And this? The tail. Excellent.
FRANK => Debra Jo McMillian. DEBRA JO comes screaming out from the sea of girls, hugging friends and crying as if she had just won the Ms. America Pageant.

P.A. O => Will Mr. Joe Shaye k a white courtesy phone. Mr. J e, please pick up a white courtes one. in the distance, JOE watches as the eight girls walk toward him. He hesitates for a BEAT, then walks to the back of the restaurant and finds a WHITE PHONE.

AMDURSKY => Joe, you're walkie talkie wasn't working. There's a guy in a Pan Am uniform sitting in a white Cadillac in front of terminal J!
JOE SHAYE => That's the charter terminal. Can you' see his face?
AMDURSKY => He's got his Pilot's cap on. I think it's him!
JOE SHAYE => Frank, get out of the car! Put your hands on the hood! There's no place to run, so just make it easy on yourself! The car door opens, aMd YEAR-OLD kid gets out of the car, his hands shaking s e(jtares at Joe -- the pilot's cap falling off his head.
KID => Don't shoot me ! I ' m\ ,s` ' ,driver! A man paid me a hundr ars to wear this uniform and p someone up at the airport!
JOE SHAYE => who are you picking up?
KID => Joe Shaye. Joe lowers his gun, immediately turns back toward theairport -- watches as a BRITISH AIRWAYS JET takes off and flies overhead, banking left and sailing out over the ocean.
SECRETARY => This just came for you, Sir. Who do you know in Liverpool? Joe takes the envelope and slowly opens it. He pulls out a stack of BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHS, all of which show the EIGHT COLLEGE GIRLS in various locations. There are shots of them on the SPANISH STEPS IN ROME, at the EIFFEL TOWER, in front of BUCKINGHAM PALACE, and in front of SCOTLAND YARD. A POSTCARD OF THE MONA LISA is inside the envelope, with the words "WISH YOU WERE HERE" written across the back.
FRANK => Excuse me. Do u know where the Lavalier fa lives?
FRANK => Hello. Do you speak English? Monique nods.
FRANK => My name is Frank. My mother is Paula Lavalier. I was hoping to find my family. Monique takes Frank by the hand, starts to smile.

MONIQUE => Here. Your mother sent me this to me a few months ago. Monique hands Frank a color photograph. Frank looks at the picture, sees Paula standing with Jack Wright, holding a BABY in her arms.
MONIQUE => You look like your new sister.
FRANK => Everyone says that.
FRANK => My name is Frank Wagner, and I'll be teaching the Summer session of American History, the same course I taught at Yale last year. Why don't you all open your books to chapter one, read quietly to yourselves.
F o.) => Dear Dad. I'm re ad %ow, living a quiet life in a sm lage in France. I hope you g well, and you're not mad at running away. Frank blows out the candles on the cake. FRANK Yesterday was my 19th birthday, and when I blew out the candles I wished that we could all be together, the three of us living in our old house in New Rochelle.
MONIQUE => I have to pick Pappa up, his car is dead. Come with me, Frank, you can see where he works? Debbie Zane - 5

MONIQUE => No. Paper.
FEET WIDE. => The giant machine fills warehouse. SIX MEN work in the massive press room, t r afening THUMP of the machine shaking the walls as it strugYle, it out 10 COLOR PAGES a minute. WE SEE samples of their ning the walls -- FRENCH

JOE SHAYE => Singapore. Australia. South America:' Egypt. He's also hit almost every major bank in Europe.
JOE SHAYE => Nobody was called, Sir. The banks didn't know what was happening until last week. We think he's been on the run for five months.
JOE SHAYE => He's making real checks, Sir. These are so perfect, Pan Am cashed them all.
JOE SHAYE => The last check was cashed in Paris a week ago. He'll stay there another week before he moves on. We have to go now, Sir, today!
JOE SHAYE => Paris.
JOE SHAYE => English. Do you speak English? I'm an American FBI Agent. Hello? Shit! Joe slams down the phone, walks out'of his office. JOE SHAYE Does anyone here speak French. I need someone who speaks French!
FOX => He's not an agent, Joe. He's a waiter at the restaurant around the corner.
DETECTIVE JULIEN => Julien.
JOE SHAYE => Who answered the phone? What's his name.
OLIVER => His name is Detective Julien. He works in the vice squad in Paris
JOE SHAYE => That's fine. Tell him I have a proposition for him. Tell him the FBI has a proposition for him. Oliver translates as Joe paces in front of him.
OLIVER => Okay. What's the proposition?
JOE SHAYE => Ask him if he'd like to catch the greatest bank robber the world has ever known.
CLOSE ON => DETECTIVE JULIEN sitting al--h!ts riesk, his expression suddenly changing as he glances aroun tation. He quickly puts the crossword puzzle away and rips into the phone. Abagnale.
FRENCH CHAUFFEUR => Where to, Mister Wagner?
FRANK => Let's go for a drive. I need some supplies. The limo drives off. Debbie Zane - 5
JOE SHAYE => When he gets to a new city he starts out slow, hitting the banks on the outskirts of town. At first it's small checks in small banks that pose little or no threat. WE HEAR OLIVER'S TRANSLATION behind Joe's voice. JOE SHAYE Then he starts moving in, circling the city like a mother hawk, picking off every little bank he can find -- slowly inching his way toward the center of the city.
CLOSE ON => DETECTIVE JULIEN -- standing in the middle of Paris, looking down an endless row of massive banks.
JOE SHAYE => He'll make his move right before lunch, when everyone's mind is on food and the lines are short. And he likes to stand out -- draw attention to himself.
JOE SHAYE => The more people see him, the more invisible he becomes.
afternoon. => Frank turns the check over a tees L. check to the teller, but she s take 1 it.
FRANK (CONT => Is there something wrong? The bank teller is shaking and staring at Frank. He slowly turns around, sees DETECTIVE JULIEN standing behind him with his gun drawn.

JOE SHAYE => Your father i ead, Frank. I'm sorry. Frank turns to Joe. JOu i He committed su 0.cL didn't want to be the one to t
FRANK => Suicide. No. That's imps 'ibl
JOE SHAYE => They found him inside his car, the motor running, the garage door shut.
FRANK => who are they to think that? Who are they to say something like that?!
JOE SHAYE => It's okay, Frank.
FRANK => Joe, I'm gonna be sick! I have to use the bathroom. Joe quickly takes off Frank's handcuffs, and he jumps from his seat and runs into the bathroom. Joe stands in the aisle with Amdursky and Fox. Debbie Zane - 5
JOE SHAYE => Frank.
1.4 => Break it down. Amdursky starts kicking at the bathroom door, slamming his heel against the metal release. The door breaks free, and the three men stares in disbelief at the EMPTY BATHROOM.
LATER. => The plane has landed and stopped short on the runway. WE SEE Frank crawling through a HATCH near the landing gear. He drops fifteen feet to the ground below, starts running across the runway.
JOE SHAYS => Look under every seat, in every bathroom. Check it all again, even the cockpit! As Joe starts moving through the plane, something outside the window catches his eye.
JOE SHAYE => God in heaven...
Mom... => Frank stumbles down the cent e, dropping to his knees and fainting before he reach= h ter.
FI => Frank opens his eyes, sees his mother standing at the window in a PRIEST'S PRIVATE OFFICE -- a cigarette in her hand, a row of collection plates on the desk in front of her...
PAULA => You want a sip of water? Paula hands Frank some water. He sits up and stares at his mother.
FRANK => Why didn't you help him?
PAULA => I did help him. Near the end I sent him money, did you know that?
PAULA => I paid his rent. I was a kid when we met, Frankie. I didn't even speak English -- I didn't even know his last name.
FRANK => Then why did you marry him?
PAULA => Because he got me pregnant. I was seventeen, and I was told I was going to marry him. They put me on a plane, and said I was the luckiest girl in the world.
FRANK => What about the baby?
PAULA => The baby died an hour after it was born. The Doctor's knew as soon as he came out. Paula lights a fresh
CONT'D) => It was a boy. T telling me I should hold him, didn't want to. I was scared he ie in my arms, so I said no. C imagine that, Frank, I didn't to hold my own son? Frank walks toward his mother and takes the cigarette out of her mouth.
FRANK => You promised. He doesn't look back at her as he walks out the door.
JUDGE => Taking into account your refusal to give back the money, your history of bold escape and your complete lack of respect for the uniform of the law, I have no choice but to sentence you to eighteen years in Atlanta's maximum security prison in Dixon county, and recommend strongly that you be kept in an isolation cell for the entirety of that sentence.
JOE SHAYE => Merry Christmas, Frank.
JOE SHAYE => I got some cigarettes here.
FRANK => I don't smoke. An awkward moment as Joe puts the cigarettes on the floor.
JOE SHAYE => They say the first year inside is the hardest.
FRANK => You caught me. What do you want?
JOE SHAYE => I don't know. Maybe this was a bad idea. I'll go. As Joe starts to put the phone down.
FRANK => You're still wearing a wedding ring.
JOE SHAYE => Yeah. The truth is, I'm divorced- I have a daughter who's nine.
FRANK => What's her name?
JOE SHP_YE => Vanessa. She lives in Chicago with her mother. I don't see her much. Frank stares at Joe for a BEAT. I'm on my way el tJe airport. I'm tracking a paper ge who's working his way through Mit This guy is driving us crazy.
FRANK => Do you have any of the checks?
FL => Joe hesitates, then opens his briefcase and takes out a CHECK. He holds it against the glass.
JOE SHAYE => This is a counterfeit from Great Lakes Savings and Loan. You can see that he's using a...
FRANK => It's a teller at the bank.
JOE SHAYE => What?
FRANK => It's a teller.
JOE SHAYE => How do you know?
FRANK => Every bank uses hand stamps for the dates. They get used over and over, so they're always worn down, and the numbers are always cracking -- the sixes and nines go first. Look at the date on that check -- the ink is worn flat, the nines and sixes are cracking -- that's the stamp of a teller, Joe. Looks like you got yourself an inside job.
FRANK => Eastern flight 794 you are clear to taxi on runway_two-zero-four. That's a big thank y, and goodbye, Newark. Ladies and eman, we are leveled off here at't five thousand feet. The sm gns have been turned off for of you in a designated smoki My name is Captain Frank Will so just sit back, relax, an the flight to Milan.
FRANK => Joe, one of these days you should get yourself a new jacket. What is that material? Frank touches Joe's jacket.
JOE SHAYE => Cashmere.
FRANK => That isn't cashmere -- look at the lining. It's some kind of polyester. You should see my tailor in New York.
JOE SHAYE => Frank, this is FBI Director Marsh. He wanted to meet you.
FRANK => At four in the morning? 1 1
F K => That's righ ve years, two months.
TOR MARSH => I'd like you tcY o k at something for me, tell me UO %u think. Director Marsh takes an enveldi j of a briefcase, slides it over to Frank. Frank opens t lope and pulls out a PAYROLL CHECK. He holds the check is hand, never looks at it.
FRANK => It's a fake.
FRANK => There's no perforated edge, which means this check was hand cut, not fed. The paper is double bonded, much too heavy for a check. The ink is raised against my fingers instead of flat. Frank brings the check to his nose, sniffs it.
FRANK => I already have a job here. I deliver the mail.
JOE SHAYE => No, Frank. We'd get you out.
FRANK => Why are you saying this, Joe? You caught me, isn't that enough? Why can't you lea ' me alone?
ECTOR MARSH => Frank, we ha wer to take you out of prison. be placed in the custody of t where you'd serve the remainde ur sentence as an employee of t al government.

FRANK => I'm Frank Abagnale. I'm supposed to start work here today.
SECURITY GUARD => First floor, Mr. Abagnale.
FRANK => Call me Frank.
FRANK => Morning, Joe. Frank turns and stares at a door marked FRAUD. He casually walks inside.
SKYLINE. => Look at me,
FRANK => I'd rather stay in a hotel.
JOE SHAYE => That's not possible. Frank opens the drapes and looks out at a POLICE STATION that sits across the street from his apartment.
FRANK => One of the men gave me a check today. It was for nine dollars.
JOE SHAYS => That's right. The FBI is paying you prison wages. Joe turns to walk out the door.
FRANK => Tomorrow's Christmas Eve. Would it be okay if I went to work with you?
JOE SHAYE => Tomorrow night I'm flying to Chicago to see my daughter. But I'll be back at work on Monday.
FRANK => Joe. . .what do I do until Monday?
JOE SHP_YE => I can't help you there, kid.
JOE SHAYE => That's a nice uniform, Frank. Here, let me get your check. Joe grabs the check from Frank, puts some money on the table. JOE SHAYE Did you know I was recruited by the FBI while I was still in law school? The government said I was the best the country had to offer, top of my class -- and they chased me until I said yes.
FRANK => I'm sorry, Joe.
JOE SHAYE => I spent four years arranging your release. I convinced the Attorney General of the United States that you wouldn't run. Frank gets out of his fir, walks out of the restaurant. Joe follows him throw h, irport. JO' : E You go back to E pe rpd you'll die in Papigone. You run here in the states and w 1 d you back to Atlanta for f' ars.
FRANK => I never asked for your help.

FRANK => Why did you do it?
JOE SHAYE => You're just a kid.
FRANK => I'm not your kid. I'm not your son. I'm nothing to you. And you're nothing to me. Frank walks toward the AMERICAN AIRLINES ticket counter.
JOE SHAYE => I'm gonna let you fly tonight. I won't even try and stop you, because I know you'll be back on Monday.
FRANK => Why would I come back?
JOE SHAYE => Because nobody is chasing you. Frank stares at Joe for a long BEAT.
FRANK => Two mice fell in a bucket of cream. The first mouse gave up and drowned, but the second mouse struggled so hard he churned that cream into butter and he crawled out.
JOE SHAYE => Which one are you, Frank? Frank turns to the gin? ar the TICKET COUNTER.
1V => Hello, Amanda,   s s Jh e jump-seat open on the ten-thirt  N,wYork? Joe watches as Frank walks thk oor marked CREW ONLY, casually making his way toward D une.
JOE SHAYE => is Abagnale in yet?
SECRETARY => No.
JOE SHAYE => Good morning. I've called this emergency briefing to discuss a check
JOE SHAYE => Don't ask. The briefing room door opens, and Frank walks in. Joe spots him in the darkness. JOE SHAYE Good. You're here. The two men stare at each other for a BEAT. JOE SHAYE At this time I'd like my point man on this to fill you in. Frank, are you ready to Ake over?

JOE SHAYE => Where did you get eight hundred dollars?

JOE SHAYE => Somebody gave you a credit card? That's a horrifying thought. The two men sit in silence for a BEAT, staring down at their magazines, lost in thought. JOE SHAYE Can I ask you something, Frank?
FRANK => Sure.
JOE SHAYE => How did you pass the bar exam in Louisiana?
FRANK => I studied every night for two weeks.
JOE SHAYE => Is that the truth? Frank turns to the wipf'or?, slowly starts to smile as he looks out at the clouds. FRANK ABAGNALE JR. HAS BEEN Qf MOR 25 YEARS. HE HAS THREE TEENAGE SONS, AND LIVES r V LIFE IN TULSA, OKLAHOMA.
