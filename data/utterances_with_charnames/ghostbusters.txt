WERECHICKEN => 
WERECHICKEN =>  The chickens' heads jerk up toward the sound.
WERECHICKEN => 
ZEKE => Sump'n's stirrin' up the chickens, Maude.
MAUDE => Jes' set easy, Zeke.  I'll take a look-see.
WERECHICKEN => 
MAUDE =>  Here, chick-chick-chick-chick.
MAUDE => What's got you girls so durned upset? There a coyote sneakin' 'round?
WERECHICKEN => 
MAUDE => 
WERECHICKEN => 
TV WEREWOLF => 
ZEKE =>  Everythin' okay out there, Maude?
MAUDE-CHICKEN => 
ZEKE => What say?
MAUDE-CHICKEN => 
ZEKE => 
ZEKE =>  Get away!' Scat!  Shoo!
MAUDE-CHICKEN => 
ZEKE =>  Help!... He-elp!
PETER => Egon, could you hold off on the weather balloon bit for a minute?
PETER => It's Your night to take out the trash.
RAY => And Winston's in the kitchen doing your dishes.
EGON =>  Be with you in ...  ...one minute, fifty-three seconds.
SLIMER => 
PETER =>  Thanks, Slimer.  I really needed that!
SLIMER => Sorreee!
RAY =>  Egon!  The phone!
EGON =>  In a minute, Ray.
WINSTON =>  Nevermind, Egon, wouldn't want you to strain yourself.  Ghostbusters Central.
WINSTON => Calm down... Where are you?...  We'll be right there.
WINSTON => Ready for this one?  Some farmer says his wife was eaten by a giant chicken.
PETER => Hey, even a half-baked false alarm sounds better than doing Egon's chores.  Let's roll!
EGON => I think I've finally perfected it.  Watch this, guys. (a BEAT, he looks around over shoulder) Guys?
RAY => It sure feels strange not having Egon with us.
PETER =>  Why?  Lately even when he's with us, he's not with us.
WINSTON => But wouldn't it be somethin' if he sells that weather balloon idea of his?  He'll be a rich man!
PETER => Good.  Then he can hire a maid to do his share of the chores.
MAUDE-CHICKEN => 
MAUDE-CHICKEN => 
ZEKE => Had big blood-red eyes, it did.  Biggest dang chicken I ever seen.  Mebbe six feet tall.
WINSTON => Shouldn't be hard to find.
RAY => Did it have any distinguishing marks?
PETER => Ray!  It's six feet tall!
PETER =>  Thank you, Sir.  We'll put out a missing chicken report right away.
PETER =>  This one's easy, guys.  Old Zeke's been watchin' too many horror movies and eating too much greasy popcorn.
RAY => No, Peter, I think we're dealing with a bonafide werechicken here.
WINSTON => A werechicken?
PETER => Get serious, Ray.
RAY => Then explain those!
SLIMER => 
SLIMER => Ow!
SLIMER => 
RAY =>  What'd I tell you, Peter?  A werechicken egg!  Gimme a hand, Winston!
PETER => Look, if this is a werechicken egg,
PETER => ...how come there's no PKE reading?
RAY =>  I dunno... that is strange.
WINSTON => Let's get it back to Headquarters and run some tests.  Then maybe we'll have some answers.
RAY => Oh no, I'm not leavin'.  The werechicken that laid this has gotta be around here someplace -- and I'm gonna find it.
PETER =>  I'll take it.  C'mon, Slimer.
PETER =>  Werechickens.
WERECHICKEN => 
PETER =>  Yo, balloon man, we've got some real work for you:  How about analyzing this?
EGON => Interesting.  That's the second biggest egg I've ever seen.
PETER => I don't wanna hear about it, Egon.  We've had a long night in a not-too-fragrant barnyard, so I'm taking a shower and hitting the sheets.
WINSTON =>  Ray, it's gettin' pretty late.  Maybe there really isn't any...
RAY =>  Shh!
RAY =>  It's in there.
WINSTON =>  Then let's get it!
WINSTON =>  Man, this place is creepy.
RAY =>  It's in here -- I can feel it.
WINSTON => Look out!
WERECHICKEN => 
RAY =>  Something's close.  Very close.
WERECHICKEN => 
WERECHICKEN => 
WERECHICKEN => 
RAY => It is a werechicken!
WINSTON => Man, he is ugly!
WERECHICKEN => 
RAY => Bad choice of words, Winston.
WERECHICKEN => 
WERECHICKEN => 
SPIRIT => 
RAY => Trap out!
WINSTON => Hang on!  That's it!
RAY => We've almost got him!
CHICKEN => 
RAY =>  Well, that takes care of one werechicken.
RAY => Now to find the six-footer that ate Zeke's wife.
WINSTON => Ray, I just had a thought...
WINSTON => What if that six-foot werechicken is Zeke's wife?
EGON =>  Thanks for the help, Slimer, but I don't have time to examine this egg tonight.  I have to prepare for my weather balloon demonstration tomorrow morning.
EGON =>  But it'll be safe in here.
SLIMER => Yeah.
SLIMER =>  G'night, Egon.
EGON => Goodnight, Slimer.
SLIMER => 
SLIMER => Fooooood.
SLIMER =>  Yummy!
SLIMER => 
SLIMER => 
SLIMER => 
BABY WERECHICKEN => 
SLIMER => 
PETER => 
PETER =>  Slimer!  How 'bout some privacy??
SLIMER =>  Monster!  Inna kitchen!
PETER => Monster?
SLIMER =>  Uh-huh!  Uh-huh!  
EGON =>  Ow!
BABY WERECHICKEN => 
EGON =>  What?
EGON-CHICKEN => 
PETER =>  Egon?  Well, Slimer, I don't see anything here that looks like a monster.
EGON-CHICKEN => 
SLIMER => 
PETER => Holy cow!!
EGON-CHICKEN => 
EGON-CHICKEN => 
PETER =>  What'd you do to Egon, you bird-brain!
RAY => Peter!  Wait!
PETER =>  Hey!
EGON-CHICKEN => 
PETER =>  What's wrong with you guys?  That thing ate Egon!
RAY => Peter, that is Egon!  The egg hatched, he was bitten and now he's a werechicken!
PETER =>  You're kidding!  Come to think of it, there was a certain resemblance.
WINSTON =>  What happened?  He's so quiet all of a sudden.
RAY => It's the moon!
RAY => Tonight's the first --
RAY => -- lunar eclipse in ten years!
PETER => Ray, what's this have to do with Egon being a chicken?
RAY =>  Werechickens only appear during a full moon, and for the next few minutes, the moon's not full.
RAY =>  Egon?
EGON => Ray, what is going on?
EGON => And why am I naked?
SLIMER =>  Egon! 
PETER => Sit down, Egon, we have some good news and some bad news.
EGON =>  Bad news first.
WINSTON => You've been turned into a werechicken!
EGON => A werechicken?
RAY =>  Were-aardvarks ... were-bears werechickens!  "The werechicken appears during the full moon.  Anyone it bites will turn into another werechicken."  That egg Peter brought in, it hatched and...
EGON =>  I remember the bite clearly.  How long will I stay like this?
RAY =>  According to this, there is an antidote. But we've gotta move fast -- the eclipse only lasts three minutes!
RAY =>  "One tablespoon paprika, one clove of garlic, some parsley for color, cup of gelatin..."
EGON =>  I don't feel well.
PETER =>  Take it easy, Egon.  You're gonna be fine.  Hurry it up, guys!
RAY =>  "And one tablespoon of chickenbane."
SLIMER =>  No chickenbane!
RAY => Then we've gotta go with this!  C'mon!
PETER =>  Come on, Ray!!
PETER =>  He's changing again!
RAY =>  Quick, Egon, drink this!
EGON => 
WINSTON => We're too late!
PETER => What happened?
RAY => The potion only partly worked, because of the missing chickenbane.
PETER => Well, we hafta do something!
EGON => Don't get your feathers ruffled, Peter. There's a logical solution to every problem.
BABY WERECHICKEN => 
SLIMER => 
WINSTON => What was that?
RAY => The werechicken that bit Egon.  It's still out there somewhere.
PETER =>  Let's stop that thing before it makes drumsticks out of anyone else!  Un, no offense, Egon.
PETER =>  All quiet on the chicken front.  How about down there?
RAY => Not a peep.
WINSTON =>  No pun intended.
PEOPLE => 
WINSTON => That's it!
BOX BOY =>  It's in there!  A big chicken!  It's gotta be ten feet tall!
WINSTON => Ten feet tall?
BOX BOY =>  Maybe fifteen, I dunno.  Big!  I'm outta here!
RAY =>  Let's split up.
WINSTON => How could we lose a fifteen foot-tall chicken?
BUTCHER => 
RAY => We didn't!  Come on!
BUTCHER => A giant chicken just came through here -- it was thirty feet tall!
WINSTON => Thirty feet tall?
BUTCHER => Yeah!  Look what it did to those cars!
PETER =>  It's how big?  Okay, Ray, I admit you were right about these Werechickens,...
PETER => ...but I definitely don't buy them growing to the size of buildings.
SLIMER => 
SLIMER => 
WERECHICKEN => 
PETER =>  Ray, you were right!  The chicken's here, and he's a walking high-rise!
RAY =>  On our way, Peter.
JANINE => 
EGON => 
JANINE => Egon!  What happened?
EGON => It's a long story, Janine.   Can you get my coat, please?  I'm due at the weather board in forty-five...  ...minutes.
JANINE => But what ...?  Nevermind.
JANINE => Are you sure you wanna go to a meeting like -- this?
EGON => Trust me.  I'm of sound mind at least.
EGON => 
CROWD => 
PETER =>  It's heading down 34th toward the Empire State Building.
RAY => Check!  We're almost there.
WERECHICKEN => 
PETER => Take over, Slimer!
SLIMER => Roger!
WERECHICKEN => 
RAY => Let's reel him in!
SPIRIT => 
WINSTON =>  Trap's full!  Somebody forgot to empty it!
RAY =>  Whose job was it?
RAY => It's gonna blow!
WINSTON =>  Peter, get outa here!
WERECHICKEN => 
PETER => So how're we gonna, put that big bird on ice, guys'
RAY =>  Peter, that's not a bed idea!  Chicken freezes at very low temperatures!
WINSTON => Yeah, but how do you freeze a 50-foot chicken in August?
EGON => Distinguished members of the Weather Board, my weather balloon has the clu-cluck-clu- capability --
EGON => ... of entering the upper atmosphere where clu-cluck-clu cloud formations occur.
BOARD => 
EGON => There, it can electronically alter weather cut-cut-cut-con-ditions to produce sun, rain, or...  ...snow.
BOARD MEMBERS => 
EGON =>  I, er, can explain this, but --
SLIMER => 
EGON => What?
WERECHICKEN => 
PETER =>  Egon, can we freeze that big chicken with your weather balloons
EGON =>  Yes, but you'll have to work the controls.
PETER =>  Piece of cake.
WERECHICKEN => 
WINSTON => What's it doing?
RAY => It looks like it's about to lay an --
WINSTON =>  I don't want to hear it.
EGON => Okay, Peter, the balloon's in position. Turn the lever to the extreme left.
WERECHICKEN => 
MAUDE =>  Anyone for dessert?
EGON =>  You bet, Maude.
PETER => Lemme guess -- more chickenbane soup!
EGON => I'm actually starting to like it.
MAUDE => No more werechicken problems for us, eh, Egon? 
WERECHICKEN => 
WINSTON => Uh-oh.
RAY => It came from the lab!
WERECHICKEN => 
SLIMER => 
WINSTON =>  It's just Slimer groovin' to his new James Brown tape.
SLIMER =>  I feel good! I knew that I would So good, so good, so good! (big James Brown HOWL as we --) 
PETER =>  Tell me, how do I get out of this chicken outfit?
