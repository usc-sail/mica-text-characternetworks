BEVERLY => ..."Life is very long..."
BEVERLY => TS Eliot. Not the first person to say it, certainly not the first person to think it.
BEVERLY => But he's given credit for it because he bothered to write it down.
BEVERLY => So if you say it, you have to say his name after it. "Life is very long:" TS Eliot. Absolutely goddamn right.
BEVERLY => Give the devil his due. Very few poets could've made it through Eliot's trial and come out, brilliantined and double-breasted and Anglican. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   2. 4   CONTINUED:                                                    4
BEVERLY => Not hard to imagine, faced with Eliot's first wife, lovely Viv, how Crane or Berryman might have reacted, just foot-raced to the nearest bridge; Olympian Suicidalists.
BEVERLY => Not Eliot: after sufficient years of ecclesiastical guilt, plop her in the nearest asylum and get on with it.
BEVERLY => God-a-mighty. You have to admire the purity of the survivor's instinct.
BEVERLY => Violet. My wife. She takes pills, sometimes a great many. They affect... among other things, her equilibrium. Fortunately, they eliminate her need for equilibrium...
BEVERLY => My wife takes pills and I drink. That's the bargain we've struck.
BEVERLY => The reasons why we partake are anymore inconsequential.
BEVERLY => The facts are: my wife takes pills and I drink. That's the bargain we've struck, just one paragraph of our marriage contract... cruel covenant. And these facts have over time made burdensome the maintenance of traditional American routine.
BEVERLY => Rather than once more vow abstinence with my fingers crossed in the queasy hope of righting our ship, I've chosen to turn my life over to a Higher Power and join the ranks of the Hiring Class.
BEVERLY => It's not a decision with which I'm entirely comfortable. I know how to launder my dirty undies. Done it all my life, but I'm finding it's getting in the way of my drinking.
BEVERLY => Sorry about the heat in here. My wife is cold-blooded and not just in the metaphorical sense. She does not believe in air-conditioning... as if it is a thing to be disbelieved. I knew your father, you know. Bought many a watermelon from Mr Youngblood's fruit stand. He did pass, didn't he??
JOHNNA => Yes, sir.
BEVERLY => May I ask how?
JOHNNA => He had a heart attack. Fell into a flatbed truck full of wine grapes.
BEVERLY => Wine grapes. In Oklahoma.   I'm sorry.
VIOLET => Bev...?!
BEVERLY => Yes?
VIOLET => Did you pullish? Did you...Oh, goddamn                * it... did. You. Are the police here?

VIOLET => Oh, you hire women's now the thing. I thought you meant the other woman.

VIOLET => Why don't you go fuck a fucking sow's ass?
BEVERLY => All right.
VIOLET => I'm sorry. I'll be sickly sweet. I'm soooooooo sweet. In-el-abrially sweet.
BEVERLY => We keep unusual hours here. Try not to differentiate between night and day. You won't be able to keep a healthy routine.
JOHNNA => I need the work.
BEVERLY => I myself require very little attention, thrive without it, sort of a human cactus. My wife has been diagnosed with a touch of cancer, so she'll need to be driven to Tulsa for her final chemotherapy treatments. You're welcome to use that American- made behemoth parked out in the drive. Welcome to make use of anything, everything, all this garbage we've acquired, our life's work. Do you have any questions?
JOHNNA => What kind of cancer?
BEVERLY => My God, I nearly neglected the punch line: mouth cancer.
JOHNNA => What pills does she take?
BEVERLY => Valium. Vicodin. Darvon, Darvocet. Percodan, Percocet. Xanax for fun. OxyContin in a pinch. And of course Diluadid. I can't forget Diluadid.
BEVERLY => "By night within that ancient house, Immense, black, damned, anonymous."  My last refuge, my books: simple pleasures, like finding wild onions by the side of a road, or requited love.
BEVERLY => TS Eliot. Read it or not. It isn't a job requirement, just for your enjoyment.  Here we go, round the prickly pear...                  * Prickly pear prickly pear... Here we go round the prickly pear...

IVY => Johnna.   Who was on the phone?
VIOLET => This house is falling apart, something about the basement or the sump pump or the foundation. I don't know anything about it. I can't do this by myself.
IVY => I called Karen.
VIOLET => What did she say?

IVY => I just wanted a change.
VIOLET => You're the prettiest of my three girls, but you always look like a schlub. Why don't you wear makeup?
IVY => Do I need makeup?
VIOLET => All women need makeup. Don't let anybody tell you different. The only woman who was pretty enough to go without makeup was Elizabeth Taylor and she wore a ton. Stand up straight.
IVY => Mom.
VIOLET => Your shoulders are slumped and your hair's all straight and you don't wear makeup. You look like a lesbian.
VIOLET => You could get a decent man if you spruced up. A bit, that's all I'm saying.

CHARLIE => That bother you?
MATTIE FAE => What's the last book you read?
CHARLIE => Beverly was a teacher; teachers read books, I'm in the upholstery business.
MATTIE FAE => Ah, sweetie. Your daddy's done this before. Just takes off, no call, nothing. I told your mother, "You pack that son-of-a-bitch's bags and have `em waiting for him on the front porch."
MATTIE FAE => Where's your mother?
IVY => Upstairs.
CHARLIE => They've always had trouble, Ivy.

BARBARA                             BILL => Jesus Christ.                     Vi, you sure there wasn't some event that triggered his leaving, some incident.
VIOLET => You mean like a fight.
BILL => Yes.
VIOLET => No. And we fought enough... you know... but no, he just left.
BARBARA => Maybe he needed some time away from you.
VIOLET => That's nice of you to say.
BARBARA => Good old unfathomable Dad.
VIOLET => Oh. That man. What I first fell of with -- fell in love with, you know, was his mystery. I thought it was sexy as hell.

But he'd just stand there, little smile on his face... not say a word. Sexy.
BILL => You can't think of anything unusual --
VIOLET => He hired this woman. He didn't ask me, just hired this woman to come live in our house. Few days before he left.
BARBARA => You don't want her here.
VIOLET => She's a stranger in my house. There's an Indian in my house.
BILL => You have a problem with Indians, Violet?
VIOLET => I don't know what to say to an Indian.
BARBARA => They're called Native Americans now, Mom.
VIOLET => Who makes that decision?
BARBARA => It's what they like to be called. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   31. 23   CONTINUED:                                                   23
VIOLET => They aren't any more native than me.
BARBARA => In fact, they are.
VIOLET => What's wrong with Indian?
BARBARA => Why's it so hard to call people --
VIOLET => Let's just call the dinosaurs "Native Americans" while we're at it.
BARBARA => She may be an Indian, but she makes the best goddamn apple pie I ever ate.
VIOLET => He hired a cook. It doesn't make any sense. We don't eat.
BARBARA => And now you get biscuits and gravy. Kind of nice, huh?
VIOLET => Nice for you, now. But you'll be gone soon enough, never to return.
BARBARA =>  Mom...
VIOLET => When was the last time you were here?
BARBARA                               VIOLET => Don't get started on that --         Really, I don't even remember.
BARBARA => I'm very dutiful, Mom, I call, I write, I send presents --
VIOLET => You do not write -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   32. 23   CONTINUED:                                                   23
BARBARA => Presents on birthdays, Mother's Day --
VIOLET => Because you're "dutiful."
BILL => All right, now --
VIOLET => I don't care about you two. I'd like to see my granddaughter every now --
BARBARA => Well, you're seeing her now.
VIOLET => But your father. You broke his heart when you moved away.
BARBARA => That is wildly unfair.
BILL                             VIOLET => Am I going to have to             You know you were Beverly's separate you two?                 favorite; don't pretend you don't know that.
BARBARA => I'd prefer to think my parents loved all their children equally.
VIOLET => I'm sure you'd prefer to think that Santy Claus brought you presents at Christmas, too. If you'd had more than one child, you'd know a parent always has favorites. Mattie Fae was my mother's favorite. Big deal. I got used to it. You were your Daddy's favorite.

VIOLET => Broke his heart.
BARBARA => What was I supposed to do?! Colorado gave Bill twice the money he was making at TU --
BILL => Why are we even getting into this?
BARBARA => You think Daddy wouldn't have jumped at the chance Bill got?
VIOLET => You're wrong there. You never would've gotten Beverly Weston out of Oklahoma.
BARBARA => Daddy gave me his blessing.
VIOLET => `S what he told you.
BARBARA => Now you're going to tell me the true story, some terrible shit Daddy said behind my back?
BILL => Hey, enough. Everybody's on edge --
VIOLET => Beverly didn't say terrible things behind your back --
BILL => Vi, come on --
VIOLET => He just told me he's disappointed in you because you settled. He thought                  * you had talent, as a writer.                         *
BARBARA => Daddy never said anything like that to you. What a load of absolute horseshit. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   34. 23   CONTINUED:                                                      23

BILL => Horseshit.
BARBARA => Are you high?
VIOLET => Excuse me.
BARBARA => I mean literally. You taking something?
VIOLET => A muscle relaxer.
BARBARA => Listen to me: I will not go through this with you again.
VIOLET => I don't know what you're talking about.
BARBARA => These fucking pills? Calls at three                     * AM about people in your backyard?
VIOLET => Stop yelling at me!
BARBARA => The police, all the rest of it?
VIOLET => It's not the same thing. I didn't have a reason.
BARBARA => So now it's okay to get hooked because you have a reason. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   35. 24   CONTINUED:                                                    24
VIOLET => I'm not hooked on anything.
BARBARA => I don't want to know if you are or not, I'm just saying I won't go --
VIOLET => I'm not.   I'm in pain.
BARBARA => Because of your mouth.
VIOLET => Yes, because my mouth burns from the chemotheeeahh --
BARBARA => Are you in a lot of pain?
VIOLET => Yes, I'm in pain. I have got... gotten cancer. In my mouth. And it burns like a... bullshit. And Beverly's disappeared and you're yelling at me.
BARBARA => I'm not yelling at you.
VIOLET => You couldn't come home when I got cancer but as soon as Beverly disappeared you rushed back --
BARBARA => I'm sorry... you're right. I'm sorry.
BARBARA => Know where I think he is? I think he got some whiskey, a carton of cigarettes, and a couple of good spy novels... I think he got out on the boat, steered it to a nice spot, close to shore... and he's fishing, and reading, and drinking, maybe even writing a little. I think he'll walk right through that door any time. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft    36.
JEAN => Hi, again... Am I bugging you?
JOHNNA => No, do you need something?
JEAN => No, I thought maybe you'd like to smoke a bowl with me?
JOHNNA => No, thank you.
JEAN => Okay. I didn't know.  Do you mind if I smoke a bowl?
JOHNNA => I.   No, I --
JEAN => Mom and Dad don't mind. You won't get into trouble or anything.
JOHNNA => Okay.
JEAN => Okay. You sure?
JEAN => I say they don't mind. If they knew I smuggled this on the plane? And sat there sweating like in that movie Midnight Express. Did you see that?
JOHNNA => I don't think so.
JEAN => I just mean they don't mind that I smoke pot. Mom kind of does. I think cause Dad smokes pot too, and she wishes he didn't.  You sure?
JOHNNA => Yes.   No.    I'm fine.
JEAN => Wow, are those your parents?
JOHNNA => Mm-hm, their wedding picture.
JEAN => Their costumes are fantastic.    Are they still together?
JOHNNA => My father passed away last year.
JEAN => Oh.    Sorry.
JOHNNA => That's okay. Thank you.
JEAN => Were you close?
JOHNNA => Yes.   Very.
JEAN => My Mom and Dad are separated now.

JEAN => He's fucking one of his grad students. I don't care --aside from the pathetic English and Humanities cliche, like all those departmental dicks fucking their students -- he can fuck who he wants and that's who teachers meet, students. He was just a turd the way he didn't give Mom a chance to respond or anything. What sucks now is she's on my ass cause she's afraid I'll have some post-divorce freak-out and become some heroin addict or shoot everybody at school. Or God forbid, lose my virginity. I don't know what it is about Dad splitting that put Mom on hymen patrol.  Don't say anything about Mom and Dad; okay? They want to play it low key.
BILL => Ivy leave?
BARBARA =>  I'd forgotten about the lightning bugs.
BILL => Look what I found...
BARBARA => We have copies.
BILL => I don't remember a hardback edition. Think this is worth something... first edition, hardback, mint condition? Academy Fellowship, Wallace Stevens Award? This book was a big deal.
BARBARA => It wasn't that big a deal.
BILL => In those circles, it was.
BARBARA => Those are small circles.
BILL => "Dedicated to my Violet." That's nice. Christ, probably every word he wrote after this he had to be thinking, "What are they going to say, are they going to compare it to Meadowlark?"
BARBARA => Jean go to bed?
BILL => Just turned out the light. You'd think at some point, you just write something anyway and who cares what they say about it. I don't know --
BARBARA => Will you shut up about that fucking book?! You are just dripping with envy over these thirty poems my father wrote back in the late sixties, for God's sake. Y'hear yourself?
BILL => I have great admiration for these poems -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   40. 27   CONTINUED:                                                   27
BARBARA => My father didn't write anymore for a lot of reasons, but critical opinion was not one of them, hard as that may be for you to believe.
BILL => What are you attacking me for?   I haven't done anything.
BARBARA => I'm sure that's what you tell Sissy, too, so she can comfort you, reassure you, "No, Billy, you haven't done anything."
BILL => Why are you bringing that up?
BARBARA => They're all symptoms of your male menopause, whether it's you struggling with the "creative question," or screwing a girl who still wears a retainer.
BILL => All right, look, I'm not going to be held hostage here while you attack me. And her name is Cindy.
BARBARA => I know her stupid name -- do me the courtesy of recognizing when I'm demeaning you.
BILL => Violet really has a way of putting you in attack mode, you know that? You feel such rage for her you can't help dishing it --
BARBARA => Psychoanalyze me right now, I skin you.
BILL => You may not agree with my methods, but you know I'm right -- "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   41. 27   CONTINUED:                                                   27
BARBARA => "Your methods." Thank you, Doctor, but I actually don't need any help from my mother to feel rage.
BILL => You want to argue? Is that what you need to do? Pick a subject, alright, let me know what it is, so I have a fighting --
BARBARA => The subject is me! I am the subject, you narcissistic motherfucker! I am in pain! I need help!
BILL => I've copped to being a narcissist. We're the products of a narcissistic generation.
BARBARA => You can't do it, can you? You can't talk about me for two seconds --
BILL => You called me a narcissist!
BARBARA => You do understand that it hurts, to go from sharing a bed with you for twenty-three years to sleeping by myself.
BILL => I'm here, now. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   42. 29   CONTINUED:                                                      29
BARBARA => Oh, men always say shit like that, as if the past and the future don't exist.
BARBARA => It's just horseshit, to avoid talking about the things they're afraid to say.
BILL => I'm not necessarily keen on the notion of saying things that would hurt you.
BARBARA => Like what?
BILL => We have enough on our hands with your parents right now, let's not revisit this.
BARBARA => When did we visit this to begin with? I still don't know what happened. Do I bore you, intimidate you, disgust you? Is this just about the pleasures of young flesh, teenage pussy? I really need to know.
BILL => You need to know now? With Beverly missing, and your mother crazy as a loon? You want to do this now?
BARBARA => You're right. I'll just hunker down for a cozy night's sleep upstairs. Next to my husband.
BILL => This discussion deserves our   care. And patience. We'll both be    in a better frame of mind to talk   about this once your father's come   home.
BARBARA => Mom?
BARBARA => Mom, wake up, the sheriff's here.
VIOLET => Did you call them?    I dig in call them.

BILL => Go back to bed, sweetheart....
BILL => What happened?
SHERIFF => Couple old boys running jug lines in the lake hooked him. Pulled him up.
BILL => He drowned. That's how he died, from drowning?
SHERIFF => Looks it.     Yes, sir.
BILL => Is there any way to determine if he... I mean is this an accident, or suicide --?
SHERIFF => There's really no way to tell.
BILL => What's your guess?
SHERIFF => ...Suicide.
BILL => How does a a person jump in the water... and choose not to swim?
JEAN => What about Aunt Ivy?
BARBARA => I guess we'll stop on the way. Christ, I need to call Karen, too. Why the fuck am I brushing my hair?

BARBARA => I used to go out with that boy. That man.
JEAN => What man? The Sheriff?
BARBARA => In high school. He was my prom date.
JEAN => You're kidding.
BARBARA => Day of the prom, his father got drunk and stole his car, stole his own son's car, went somewhere, Mexico. Deon showed up at the door. He'd been crying.

BILL => Let me go first, see what they need.
BARBARA => Listen to me: die after me, all right? I don't care what else you do, where you go, how you screw up your life, just... survive. Outlive me, please.

KAREN => I spent so    much time in our bedroom pretending    my pillow was my husband and did he    like the dinner I made and where were    we going to vacation that winter and    he'd surprise me with tickets to    Belize and we'd kiss.
KAREN => I mean I'd kiss my pillow, and then I'd tell him I'd been to the doctor that day and I'd found out I was pregnant. I know how pathetic that sounds, but it was innocent enough. Then real life takes over, cause it always does --
BARBARA => -- uh-huh --
KAREN => Things don't work out like you planned. That pillow was a better husband than any real man I'd ever met; this parade of men fails to live up to your expectations, all of them so much less than Daddy or Bill. You punish yourself, tell yourself it's your fault you can't find a good one. I don't know how well you remember Andrew...
BARBARA => No, I remember. "August" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   51. 49   CONTINUED:                                                   49
KAREN => I loved him so intensely, so the things he did wrong were just opportunities for me to make things right. If he cheated on me or called me a cunt, I'd think "No, love is forever, so here's an opportunity to make an adjustment in the way you view the world."
KAREN => And thank God one day I looked in the mirror and said, "Moron," and walked out, but it kicked off this whole period of reflection, how hard I had screwed it up, where'd I go wrong. That's when I got into those books and discussion groups --
BARBARA => And Scientology too, right, or something like that --?
KAREN => Exactly, and finally one day, I threw it all out, I said, "It's me, just me with my music on the stereo, my glass of wine and Bloomers my cat. I don't need anything else, I can live my life with myself." I got my license, threw myself into my work, sold a lot of houses, and that's when I met Steve.
KAREN => That's how it works, you only find it when you're not looking, you turn around and there it is: Steve. Ten years older than me, but a thinker, and he's just so good. He's a good man and he's good to me and he's good for me.
KAREN => The best thing about him, for me, is that now what I think about is now. I live now. My focus, my life, my world is now. I don't give a care about the past anymore, the mistakes I made, the way I thought. And you can't plan the future cause as soon as you do, something happens, some terrible thing happens --
BARBARA => Like your father drowning himself.
KAREN => That's exactly what I mean. You take it as it comes, here and now! Steve had a huge presentation today for some big-wig government guys who could be important for his business, something he's put together for months, and as soon as we heard about Daddy, he cancelled his meeting. He has his priorities straight. And you know what the kicker is?  Do you know what the kicker --?
BARBARA => What's the kicker?
KAREN => We're going to Belize on our honeymoon!
BARBARA => Sorry.   Hot flash.

IVY => It's not my style, Mom.
VIOLET => You don't have a style, that's the point.
MATTIE FAE => Where was this taken?
VIOLET => New York.    On the first book tour.
IVY => I don't have your style, I have a style of my own.
VIOLET => You wore a suit to your father's funeral. A woman doesn't wear a suit to a funeral.
IVY => God, you're weird; it's a black suit.
VIOLET => You look like a magician's assistant.
MATTIE FAE => Little Charles has been talking about moving to New York. Can you picture that?
VIOLET => Don't discourage him now --
MATTIE FAE => He wouldn't last a day in that city. They'd tear him apart.
VIOLET => Stop being so sensitive.
MATTIE FAE => He overslept? For his Uncle's funeral? A noon service?
IVY => I'm sure there's more to the story --
MATTIE FAE => Don't make excuses for him. That's what Charlie does. Thirty-seven years old and can't drive? Who can't drive?
MATTIE FAE => I've seen a chimp drive.
IVY => Why are you giving away your clothes?
VIOLET => All this shit's going. I don't plan to spend the rest of my days looking at what used to be. I want that shit in the office gone, I want these clothes I'm never going to wear gone. I mean look at these fucking shoes --  Even if I didn't fall on my face, can you imagine anything less attractive, my swollen ankles and varicose veins? And my toenails, good God: anymore they could dig through cement.

BARBARA => He seemed very nice, sweetheart --
KAREN => He is, and --
BARBARA => -- but what I think doesn't matter. I'm not marrying him --
KAREN => I guess what I'm telling you is that I'm happy. I've been unhappy most of my life,   my adult life. I doubt you've been aware of that. I know our lives have led us apart, you, me and Ivy. Maybe we're not as close as, as close as some families --
BARBARA => Yeah, we really need to talk about Mom, what to do about Mom --
KAREN => -- but I think I haven't wanted to live my unhappiness in view of my family. But now I'm just really happy. I'd like us to get to know each other a little better.

STEVE => Slaughterhouse sanitation.

JEAN => No.
STEVE => You can tell me.

VIOLET => Look at me.  Look at me.
IVY => You're beautiful, Mom.
VIOLET => I was beautiful. Not anymore.
VIOLET => One of those lies we tell to give us comfort. Women are beautiful when they're young and not after. Men can still preserve their sex appeal into old age. Not those men like you see with shorts and those little purses around their waists. Some men can maintain a weary masculinity. Women just get old and fat and wrinkly.

MATTIE FAE => I'm still very sexy, thank you very much.
VIOLET => You're about as sexy as a wet card- board box, Mattie Fae, you and me both. Look, wouldn't we be better off if we stopped lying about these things and told the truth? "Women aren't sexy when they're old." I can live with that. Can you live with that?
MATTIE FAE => What about Sophia Loren? What about Lena Horne? She stayed sexy till she was eighty.

BILL => Only what I read and that's --
STEVE => Right, right, this kind of business in particular.
BILL => ...Charlie?
CHARLIE => Picking up Little Charles.
STEVE => Little Charles?
BILL => His son. I'm sorry, what is your                         * business again?
STEVE => You know, it's essentially security work. The situation in the Middle East is perpetually dangerous, so there's a tremendous amount of money involved.
BILL => Security work. You mean... mercenary?
BARBARA => Give.   Me.     The wine.
BARBARA => Is that what you were in such a hurry to get home for? What the hell's on TV that's so important you?
JEAN => Phantom of the Opera, 1925.
BARBARA => For God's sake, you can get it at any Blockbuster.
JEAN => They're showing it with the scene in color restored.
STEVE => Cool.
BARBARA => Let me make sure I've got this: when you threw a fit about going to the store with your dad... Hey, look at me.  And you were so distraught over the start time of your Grandpa's funeral. Was this your concern? Getting back here in time to watch Phantom of the Fucking Opera?
JEAN => I guess.

CHARLIE => Stop apologizing.
LITTLE CHARLES => The power must've gone out. I woke up and the clock was blinking noon. That means the power went out, right?
CHARLIE => It's okay.
LITTLE CHARLES => I missed his funeral!
CHARLIE => It's a ceremony. It's ceremonial. It doesn't mean anything compared to what you have in your heart.  Hold on, comb your hair.
LITTLE CHARLES => Uncle Bev must be disappointed in me.
CHARLIE => Your Uncle Bev has got bigger and better things ahead of him. He doesn't have time for spite. He wasn't that kind of man anyway --
CHARLIE => Hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay, now...
LITTLE CHARLES => Just... I know how things are. I know how they feel about me and something like this... you want to be there for people, and I missed Uncle Bev's funeral, and I know how they feel about me --

CHARLIE => They don't say things about you --

CHARLIE => You haven't let me down. You never let me down. Now listen...you're wrong about these people, they love you. Some of them haven't gotten a chance to see what I see: a fine man, very loving, with a lot to offer. Now take this...  Give me my comb. Stand up straight, look folks in the eye. Stop being so hard on yourself.
LITTLE CHARLES => I love you, Dad.
CHARLIE => Love you too, son.
BARBARA => Phantom of the Opera --

BILL => I got that part.
BARBARA => And you really haven't been much of a parent lately, so it's tough to --
BILL => Just because you and I are struggling with this Gordian knot doesn't mean --
BARBARA => Nice, "Gordian knot," but her fourteen- year-old self might view it differently, might consider it "abandonment" --
BILL => Oh, come on, she's a little more sophisticated than that, don't you think?
BARBARA => Pretty fucking sophisticated, the restored whatever from Phantom of the Opera, I know that makes your dick hard --

BARBARA => Y'know, you'd have a lot more credibility if you had any credibility.
BILL => You can't resist, can you?
BARBARA => You're a pretty easy mark.
BILL => You're so goddamn self-righteous, you know? You're so --
BARBARA => Surely you must've known when you started porking Pippi Longstocking you were due for a little self- righteousness, just a smidge of indignation on my part --

CHARLIE => Jean, so I'm curious, when you say you don't eat meat, you mean you don't eat meat of any kind?
JEAN => Right.
CHARLIE => And is that for health reasons, or...?
JEAN => When you eat meat, you ingest an animal's fear.
VIOLET => Ingest what? It's fur?
JEAN => Fear.
VIOLET => I thought she said --
CHARLIE => How do you do that? You can't eat fear.
JEAN => Sure you can. What happens to you, when you feel afraid? Doesn't your body produce all sorts of chemical reactions?

LITTLE CHARLES => -- yep, and cortisol --
JEAN => Don't you think an animal experiences fear?
STEVE => You bet it does. I used to work in a cattle processing plant, lot of fear flying around that place.
JEAN => So when you eat an animal, you're eating all that fear it felt when it was slaughtered to make food.
CHARLIE => Wow. You mean I've been eating fear, what, three times a day for sixty years?
MATTIE FAE => This one won't have a meal `less there's meat in it.
CHARLIE => I guess it's the way I was raised, but it just doesn't seem like a legitimate meal `less it has some meat somewhere --
MATTIE FAE => If I make a pasta dish of some kind, he'll be like, "Okay, that's good for an appetizer, now where's the meat?"
VIOLET => "Where's the meat?" Isn't that some TV commercial, the old lady says, "Where's the meat?"

VIOLET => Too much talk about poetry, teaching. He hadn't written any poetry to speak of since `65 and he never liked teaching worth a damn. Nobody talked about the good stuff. Man was a world- class alcoholic, more'n fifty years. Nobody told the story about that night he got wrangled into giving a talk at that TU alumni dinner...  Drank a whole bottle of Ron Bocoy White Rum -- don't know why I remember that -- and got up to give this talk, and he fouled himself! Comes back to our table with this huge --

BARBARA => Jesus.

That's the crux of the biscuit: we lived too hard, then rose too high. We sacrificed everything and we did it all for you.

VIOLET => I ever tell you the story of Raymond Qualls? Not much story to it. Boy I had a crush on when I was thirteen or so. Rough-looking boy, beat-up Levis, messy hair. Terrible underbite.

He was so proud of those boots, you could tell, way he'd strut around, all arms and elbows, puffed up and cocksure. I decided I needed to get a girly pair of those same boots and I convinced myself he'd ask me to go steady. He'd see me in those boots and say "Now there's the gal for me."
VIOLET => Found the boots in a window downtown and just went crazy: praying for those boots, rehearsing the conversation I'd have with Raymond when he saw me in my boots. Must've asked my momma a hundred times if I could get those boots. "What do you want for Christmas, Vi?" "Momma, I'll give all of it up just for those boots." Bargaining, you know? She started dropping hints about a package under the tree she had wrapped up, about the size of a boot box, nice wrapping paper. "Now, Vi, don't you cheat and look in there before Christmas morning." Little smile on her face. Christmas morning, I was up like a shot, boy, under the tree, tearing open that box. There was a pair of boots, all right... men's work boots, holes in the toes, chewed up laces, caked in mud and dog shit. Lord, my momma laughed for days.
BARBARA => Please don't tell me that's the end of the story.
VIOLET => Oh, no.   That's the end.

BARBARA => Okay, well, that's the worst story I ever heard. That makes me wish for a heartwarming claw hammer story.
VIOLET => My momma was a nasty-mean old lady.   I suppose that's where I get it from.
KAREN => You're not nasty-mean. You're our mother and we love you.
VIOLET => Thank you, sweetheart.
BARBARA => Last time I spoke with my father, we talked about the state of the world, and he said, "You know, this country was always pretty much a whorehouse, but at least it used to have some promise. Now it's just a shithole." I think maybe he was talking about something else, something more specific, personal... this house? This family? His marriage? Himself? There was something sad in his voice-- not sad, he always sounded sad -- hopeless. As if it had already happened. As if whatever was disappearing had already disappeared. And no one saw it go. This country, this experiment, America, this hubris: what a lament, if no one saw it go.
JOHNNA => Mrs. Fordham, are you going to fire me?
BARBARA => What? No. But I'll understand if you want to quit. I mean, there's work. And then there's work.
JOHNNA => I'm familiar with this job. I can do this job. I don't do it for you or Mrs. Weston. Or even for Mr. Weston. Right? I do it for me.

BARBARA => -- right --

BARBARA => Mild Cognitive Impairment?
DR. BURKE => Brain damage. It may be time to consider placing her in a long term care facility. I'd certainly feel more comfortable knowing she was receiving that level of supervision.

DR. BURKE => I'm sorry?

MATTIE FAE => Maybe that's because your family --
CHARLIE => You had better not say anything about my family right now. I mean it. We buried a man yesterday I loved very much. And whatever faults he may have had, he was a good, kind, decent person. And to hear you tear into your own son not even a day later dishonors Beverly's memory. We've been married thirty-eight years. I wouldn't trade them for anything.

BARBARA => Did Dad know?
MATTIE FAE => Yes.   Y'know, I'm not proud of this.
BARBARA => Really. You people amaze me. What, were you drunk? Was this just some --
MATTIE FAE => I wasn't drunk, no. Maybe it's hard for you to believe, looking at me, knowing me the way you do, all these years. I know to you, I'm just your old fat Aunt Mattie Fae. I'm more than that, sweetheart, there's more to me than that. I don't know why Little Charles is such a disappointment to me. Maybe he, well, I don't know why. I'm disappointed for him, more than anything. I made a mistake, a long time ago. Okay? I paid for it. But the mistake ends here.
BARBARA => If Ivy found out, it would destroy her.
MATTIE FAE => I'm sure as hell not gonna tell her. You have to find a way to stop it. You have to put a stop to it.

JEAN => I know what a shotgun is.
STEVE => Not that kind of shotgun, here. Just put your lips right next to mine and you inhale while I exhale.
JEAN => Okay.

JEAN => I don't want to see yours, perv.

BARBARA => Where is he?
KAREN => Out at the car. We're leaving. Back to Florida, tonight, now. Me and Steve, together. Want to give me some grief about that?
BARBARA => Now wait just a goddamn --
KAREN => You better find out from Jean exactly what went on before you start pointing fingers. Cause I doubt Jean's blameless in all this. And I'm not blaming her, just cause I said she's not blameless doesn't mean I've blamed her. I'm saying she might share in the responsibility. It's not cut and dried, black and white, good and bad. It lives where everything lives: somewhere in the middle. Where the rest of us live, everyone but you.
BARBARA => Karen--
KAREN => He's not perfect. Just like the rest of us, down here in the muck. I'm no angel myself. I've done some things I'm not proud of. Things you'll never know about.
