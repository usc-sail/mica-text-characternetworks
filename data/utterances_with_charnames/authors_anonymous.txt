HENRY => This is where where F. Scott Fitzgerald died on December 21, 1940.
HENRY => Fitzgerald was one of the truly great American writers of the 20th century. Tender is the Night. The Last Tycoon. This Side of Paradise. And, of course, my favorite, The Great Gatsby. But Fitzgerald ended up out here. Writing movies that never got made. Drinking too much. Alienating people. Losing his way.
HENRY => I stop by here sometimes--out of respect. Fitzgerald had this amazing gift.
HENRY => But he wasted it. He wasted his talent.
HENRY => When I sell my novel, I won't make his mistakes.
ALAN => We thought this was going to be a reality series.
COLETTE => You know, like the Kardashians.
ALAN => Oh. Really? A documentary? This is going to be a documentary about our writing group?
COLETTE => The whole group. Not just us, right? Not that it should be just about us...
ALAN => No.
COLETTE => So this is going to be like--like what I saw the other night on cable? About bees mating.
ALAN => Or that, um, that one about the Holocaust.
ALAN => Pretty...Pretty--
COLETTE => --Powerful.
ALAN => Powerful.   Yes. Powerful.
COLETTE => We love documentaries.
ALAN => We do.
COLETTE => Natasha, the Russian peasant, dressed oh-so-slowly...
COLETTE =>  ...consumed totally, completely, absolutely, by endless thoughts of Yuri fondling her breast, his other hand groping her womanhood, knowing...
COLETTE => ...Any second that she might explode, her chastity spraying across the ceiling...Spraying across the ceiling like passionate graffiti. Natasha never thought such a moment possible. "Have I satisfied you, Natasha?" Yuri had inquired after their fourth round of vodka-soaked lovemaking. "Nyet, Not yet," Natasha stated, exhausted, but grateful.
ALAN => Well?   Comments?
HENRY => I graduated from the University of Illinois. English major. Taught high school for a couple years, but hated it. Moved out here to be a writer.
HENRY => I work two jobs. Delivering pizzas and cleaning carpets. Good jobs for a writer.
HENRY => You meet lots of interesting people.
HENRY => I have two unpublished novels. Working on my third, Pizza to Go. These are my rejection letters. Rejected by agents. Rejected by publishers. When you think about it, it's pretty amazing how many ways people can reject you.
HENRY => Our writing group meets every Tuesday night. Mostly at Alan and Colette's. Sometimes we rotate.
HENRY => I love coming to the group. Everyone always has such constructive feedback. It's like we're all in this together.
HANNAH => I really like the way Yuri is developing, Colette.
COLETTE => You do?
JOHN => Well, if you ask John K. Butzin...
JOHN => You're still going to have to explain why this Natasha dame goes AWOL on her husband. Still kinda iffy to me.
ALAN => I was bothered by that, too. Why would Natasha betray a reliable, dependable husband for a washed-up young punk?
COLETTE => Oh.   Well...um...um...
COLETTE => Oh God. I've been rewriting and rewriting and rewriting and--
ALAN => Poodles.     It's OK.
COLETTE => No. It's not OK. I still can't explain Natasha's motive. What's the use? I'm not a writer.
WILLIAM => Whoa. Whoa. Time out. The dude's good in bed. Trust me, that's all the motive she needs.
JOHN => Roger that. Torpedo Chapter Three. Blow it up. Get the focus back on this broad--Natasha.
HENRY => --Yes. I was thinking the same thing.
HANNAH => Make it clear that Natasha wants to be closer...
HENRY => Writing can be such a solitary existence, so it's good to have this outlet where you can meet other writers and exchange ideas. Here it really is all for one and one for all.
COLETTE => Who wants coffee?
WILLIAM => Lend me ten bucks? I'm having cash flow issues.
HENRY => Sure.
WILLIAM => Thanks, bro'. You're the best.
HENRY => This new novel Pizza to Go is about Scott, a pizza delivery guy in LA. He comes across some interesting characters. I like what I have so far, but it's only a hundred pages and I'm stuck...
HENRY => ...Haven't written a word in the last two weeks. Not one. Hannah teases me about having writer's block.
HENRY => ...I keep thinking about her. She's all I think about. Really would like to ask her out.
HANNAH => What do you think? On or off? Do they make me look smarter? I need a new pair.
HANNAH => Hi. I'm originally from Prescott, Arizona. Followed my mom out here about four years ago. That's her back there.
HANNAH => My parents are divorced. Not her fault.
WILLIAM => What do you want to know about me? I'm 27. Single. A virgin.
WILLIAM => Just kidding. I'm actually 28. Hometown is Modesto, California, A sprawling junk heap of a town without a soul. Why did I come to LA? Um, because I knew you were here and that you'd loan me a hundred bucks if I needed it. Right?
WILLIAM => Thanks, babe.
WILLIAM => I already got her number. Maybe I'll text her. Maybe I won't.
WILLIAM => So 'bout that hundred bucks? What d'ya think?
WILLIAM => OK. What about fifty? C'mon, bro'. Support the arts.
HANNAH => I've always had this knack for telling stories. Ever since I was a kid.
MAUREEN => She's a natural.
HANNAH => Moved here. Took a couple writing classes. Decided to go for it. 24/7. Total dedication to my craft. The writing always comes first. My latest effort is called Sleeping on the Moon. It's about rejection. And pain. Not really about the moon itself. More of a...
MAUREEN => Metaphor.
HANNAH => Right.
WILLIAM => So. LA? I'm here because of Bukowski. Charles Bukowski. Greatest writer ever. Period.
WILLIAM => LA is his town, man. If I'm gonna be a writer, then I have to walk in Bukowski's shoes. Experience and capture the plight of the working class.
WILLIAM => I like the people in the group. But they can't write worth shit. But, man, Hannah is something. She's the only reason I keep going. Not because I'm learning anything. Hell, no. I just think she's hot.
HANNAH => My favorite writer? Favorite writer. Favorite writer...
HANNAH => Favorite. Wow. Hard to say. I've studied Composition more than actual Literature. Gee. I know Maureen enjoys Jane...
MAUREEN => Jane Austen.
HANNAH => That's the one. I hear she's good. But my favorite writer? Let me think about that a bit, OK?
HANNAH => I didn't go to college.
JOHN => Everything John K. Butzin knows about writing comes down to two simple words: Tom Clancy. Yes, sir. Tom Clancy. The man's a genius. Does his research. All those nitty-gritty technical details. Now that's writing! John K. Butzin has one agent very interested in Roaring Lion. And a publisher up in Oxnard is looking at it as we speak. Plus a certain cousin's best friend has a neighbor who has an in with Clint Eastwood, so Hollywood might be calling soon. Don't know how the other members of the writing group will handle all this success by one person. They better not be pussies.
ALAN => Well, I'm an optometrist in Glendale.
COLETTE => And I write full-time.
ALAN => Our last name's Mooney. You could call us Mooneys. We get that joke all the time.
ALAN => Which writer do I admire? Hmmm. How about John Grisham? Look at all that money he's made! Just teasing, John. We know you deserved every dime, but, hey, John, could you spread it around a bit, pal?
COLETTE => Alan likes to tease.
ALAN => Colette, here, is the real writer. I'm more of an idea guy. I come up with great ideas, but don't always follow through. I'll show you.
ALAN =>  Idea for romantic novel.
ALAN => No. Make that, idea for romantic ebook.
ALAN => Possible movie option, too: Frovers. They couldn't be friends. They couldn't be lovers. So they became Frovers.
COLETTE => This is where I come for inspiration. I believe a writer must have quiet and solitude. I'll meditate. Write in my journal. Set out my creative path for the day. This is my Walden Pond.
COLETTE => Favorite author? I'd have to say Joan Didion. Her writing sends shivers down my spine. Though Joyce Carol Oates has been known to bring me to actual orgasm.
COLETTE => Oh, this? I keep Oprah out here for luck. She's done so much to help writers. I know I'm going to be on her television show one day. I just know it.
COLETTE => What? Oprah doesn't have a TV show anymore? Really? Since when?
COLETTE => Oh...
COLETTE => I knew that. I did. I-I knew.
HENRY => Tonight's the night. I'm going to ask Hannah out.
HENRY => It's time. I like her. She likes me-- I think. I've got to take action. Still stuck on Page 100. So I'm asking Hannah out on a date tonight. It'll be great. And I'll put this writer's block behind me.
HENRY => Wish me luck.
ALAN => I'm the group leader. After all, getting together was my idea. They're all my patients. That's how we met. First one published gets a free eye exam.
ALAN => Why did I form the group? To help Colette. Oh, I certainly enjoy the creative process, but Colette? Writing is her dream. I'd do anything for her because...because she's my dream. So there you have it.
ALAN => Possible names for future characters. 
ALAN => Anthony Gilmore. No, wait. Make that Anthony T. Gilmore. Much better. Slate McCoy. Fletcher Peck. Fiona Foxx. And...a man known simply as Banjo.
JOHN =>  How come we never chow down at your place?
WILLIAM => This is my place. Close to the working people.
HENRY => Where's Hannah? Anyone know?
ALAN => Time to get started.
HENRY => Shouldn't we wait for Hannah?
WILLIAM => Let's go, people. I'm ready to read.
ALAN => William's right. We'll start. She'll show up.
COLETTE => William, aren't these the same pages you read last time?
WILLIAM => Nope, they're different.
JOHN => They look the same.
WILLIAM => They're different. I changed a word.
HENRY => One word?
COLETTE => That's it?
WILLIAM => Writing is rewriting, Colette. Bukowski said, "Write five words. Rewrite seven."
HENRY => No. Dorothy Parker said that.
JOHN => One word?    Jesus H. Christ.
WILLIAM => It's my creative vision, John.
ALAN =>  Which we are here to support. This is William's decision.
WILLIAM => Let me just read. See if you can pick out the word. Tell me if it's better, or worse.
JOHN =>  One goddamn word.
HENRY => I wonder what happened to Hannah.
ALAN => It's not like her to miss.
HANNAH => I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for missing the meeting.
JOHN => What happened? Your car break down?
ALAN => You oversleep?
COLETTE => Maureen. Is Maureen OK?
WILLIAM => People. C'mon. Look at her. That glow. Hannah met a guy. She got laid.
HANNAH => As a matter of fact, I did meet a guy.
WILLIAM => Told ya.
HANNAH => His name's Brian.
HANNAH => He's my new agent!
HANNAH =>  An agent. I've got an agent!
HANNAH => That writing class I took? Well, for the final project, I turned in the first chapter of Sleeping on the Moon. I guess the teacher liked it. Then he gave it to his friend who's an agent. Brian. He called. Had to see me right away. Brian wants to sign me.
WILLIAM => Bet Brian wants more than that.
COLETTE => That's so great, Hannah.
JOHN => I salute you, young lady.
ALAN => Yes.   Fantastic. Fanntasstic.
ALAN =>  To Hannah!
HANNAH => Thank you. But I just want to remind everyone that we're all in this together. I couldn't have come this far without the group.
ALAN =>  All for one . . . .
HANNAH => I'm merely the first one to get signed. But we're all going to have an agent soon.
JOHN => Well, as a matter of fact, there's an agent in Santa Monica very interested in John K. Butzin. He's reading the manuscript as we speak.
WILLIAM =>  Hey, can you lend me ten bucks?
HENRY => Sure.
WILLIAM => Thanks, bro'. You're the best.
ALAN => Congratulations again, Hannah!
COLETTE => Yes, yes.   Way to go, Hannah!
HANNAH =>  Thank you! 'Night.
ALAN => Well, Hannah's got an agent.
COLETTE => She must have slept with him.
ALAN => Of course she did.
HENRY => I'm so proud of you, Hannah.
HANNAH => Your turn will come, Henry. You're a better writer than I am. So much better. You went to college.
HANNAH => He's a great writer. Henry Obert. I knew him when.
HENRY => Listen. Maybe some afternoon we could go for a drive. There are some special places I'd like to show you.
HANNAH => Sure. I can't believe I've lived out here four years and haven't seen --
HANNAH => Oh, my.
HENRY => What?
HANNAH => Four years. It's been four years since I moved here. And now I have an agent. It's the number four again. My lucky number. I should have known this was going to happen.
HENRY => There is no one more deserving.
HANNAH => I'm going to dedicate my novel to you.
HENRY => I'm happy for Hannah. 
HENRY => Still, her getting an agent sort of ruins my plans, doesn't it? I mean, Hannah has an agent. I don't. That won't work for dating. I can't ask her out until I get an agent.
HENRY => That's Richard Benedict. He's written seven novels. Fantastic writer.
HENRY => The Fitzgerald of his generation. Richard Benedict made me want to be a writer.
COLETTE => My novel is called Nyet, Not Yet. It's about a Russian woman who comes to this country in search of love. It was inspired by a story I heard from one of my massage clients, Yuri. Yes, it's true--I used to do massage. In fact, that's how I met Alan, though I certainly didn't give him the kind of massage he really wanted. At least not the first time.
COLETTE => I will get an agent. It comes down to this: if Hannah can get an agent, I can get an agent. After all, I am a graduate of Mills College.
HANNAH => Have I thought of my favorite author yet? No. Not yet. There are so many, you know?
HANNAH => So. I am somewhat superstitious. Yes. Guilty. I'm drawn to the number 4. I was born at exactly 4:04 p.m. on April 4th. 4-4-4-4. That wasn't an accident. No way.
HANNAH => Certain things I've learned to avoid. Black cats. Cracked mirrors. Oh. And the number 13 especially. I hate the number 13. Hate it.
COLETTE => Hi...Hi...Hello everyone. I was just in the neighborhood and--
COLETTE => Oh, Hannah. I'm so sorry. I didn't know they'd be here--
HANNAH => Colette.    What a lovely surprise!
HANNAH => My, what's this?
COLETTE => Oh. It's nothing. I just had to say "Congratulations" to my new favorite author.
MAUREEN =>  "For Poodles...Now may we have sex again? Love, Alan."
HANNAH => So sweet of you, Colette.
COLETTE => My pleasure.     Say, Hannah...about your agent?
COLETTE => Is he--Is he taking on new clients?
HANNAH => Gee.   I don't really know.
COLETTE => Think you could ask?
HANNAH => I guess so.     Maybe.
COLETTE => Because if he is...
HANNAH => Let's talk about this at group meeting, OK?
COLETTE => Oh. Of course. Of course. Absolutely.
COLETTE => Well...
COLETTE => I've got to go. Talk soon. By the way, everything in the basket--gluten free!
MAUREEN => Colette Mooney. My, that woman is something else.
HANNAH =>  Colette Mooney. C-o-l-e-t-t-e M-o-o- n-e...
HANNAH => 13 letters.    Oh, dear...
HANNAH => Thanks for seeing me today, Alan.
ALAN => No problemo. Let's get you some new eye wear.
HANNAH => Something that makes me look smart.
HENRY => You're already smart, Hannah.
ALAN => How about...
HANNAH => Mmmmmmm.
ALAN => Excuse me.   One sec.
ALAN => Ah. Name for character. Alexander Brown. Wears brown-colored glasses.
HANNAH => Of course he would.
ALAN => You know this great idea for a novel hit me this morning. It's called Unleashed.
ALAN => It's about a dog who becomes human for 24 hours in order to rescue his kidnapped owner. I love this idea, Hannah.
HANNAH => Could be a winner.
HANNAH => What do you think?
HENRY => You look great, Hannah.
ALAN => Question: You think your agent might be interested in this idea? Does he have a dog?
HANNAH =>  Oh. I don't know--
ALAN => How about a cat? It could be a cat.
HANNAH => Um. Sure.   Probably could be.
ALAN => Think about mentioning it to your agent, OK? Unleashed. Dog -- or cat -- becomes human.
HENRY => I'll help you develop the idea, Alan.
WILLIAM => A writer has to hear everything. On the streets. In the restaurants.
WILLIAM => My dialogue has to be real so I'm everywhere. Standing behind you at the checkout stand.
WILLIAM => Peeing next to you at the urinal. I watch. I listen.
WILLIAM => Writing down scraps of conversation.
WILLIAM => That's right. I eavesdrop.
WILLIAM => How else do you accurately capture the misery of the human condition?
WILLIAM => Now Bukowski says "An intellectual says a simple thing in a hard way."
WILLIAM => "An artist says a hard thing in a simple way."
WILLIAM => Gotta love it. That's me. Simple. Real.
WILLIAM => Powerful.   An artist.
JOHN => Meet someone very s-p-e-c-i-e-l. Here with us today all the way from...
SIGRID => Germany.
JOHN => Oh! That accent! Found her    working at the hardware store. Went   in for a drill bit. Came out with a    prime candidate for Mrs. John K.    Butzin.
SIGRID =>  Apologies. American only. I come from Dusseldorf, yes? Came to this great country 90 years ago -- no, 90 days ago. Apologies. Took job in store as cleaning lady. Promoted to cashier. Now assistant, assistant manager.
SIGRID => This my 'Wall of America' tribute, yes? To my new country. And in the center, of course, the three men I admire most in America.
SIGRID => Herr Trump.    Very rich. Very famous. Very sexy.
SIGRID => Herr Simon Cowell. Very rich. Very famous. Very sexy.
SIGRID => Ja. My special guy. Herr Bootzin. About to become very rich. Very famous. Already very sexy.  Then maybe Sigrid Hagenguth becomes Mrs. John K. Bootzin, ja?
COLETTE => I know this is a rejection letter. I can't open this. I can't be rejected today. I take rejection so personally.
ALAN => I bet it's good news.
COLETTE => "Sorry. Not interested." I knew it. How can such a big rejection come from such a small piece of paper?
HANNAH =>  Hello? Yes. Oh, hi, Brian. Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god!
HANNAH =>  Oh my god!
MAUREEN => What's he saying?
HANNAH => He sold my novel.
HENRY => What?
HANNAH =>  Brian sold Sleeping on the Moon!
MAUREEN => Oh my god!   Oh my god!
HANNAH =>  Yes, Brian. I will. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I will. Promise. Thank you!
HENRY => You did it, Hannah!   You did it!
MAUREEN => I'm so proud of you, dear!
HANNAH => Thank you.
HENRY => We need to tell the group!
HANNAH => The group. Oh, dear. The group. No, no, I can't tell them about this.
HENRY => Why not?
HANNAH => Oh.
HANNAH => It will seem like I'm bragging or something. I mean I'm the one with an agent. Now this. It could be too much, too soon, don't you think?
HENRY => Suppose I tell them? They could hear the news from me.
HANNAH => Thank you, my friend. I can always depend on you, can't I?
JOHN => That's great for Hannah, her little book deal, and all. But John K. Butzin has some news to announce, as well.
JOHN => I've just inked a deal with U R the Publisher, a reputable company based in New Delhi. They publish 5000 titles internationally every year. Paying 'em two hundred dollars and they're going to format and publish my novel Roaring Lion. I've waited for this moment forever. Finally, a Butzin is going to be a published author.
SIGRID => Yoo-hoo. Mr. Published-Author-to-Be. Sigrid would like you to come in for personal, private autograph. Please. Please.
WILLIAM => Hannah's just lucky. That's all.
HENRY => Here she comes!
HANNAH => Ohhhhhh.    For me? You shouldn't have.
WILLIAM => Way to go, Ms. Published Author!
ALAN => We're all jealous, Hannah. Just teasing.
COLETTE => No.   Seriously. We're all jealous.
HANNAH => You're all making too much of a spectacle here.
HENRY => When will your book come out, Hannah?
HANNAH => A year.    Takes about a year.
WILLIAM => So how much did you get?
ALAN => Don't ask her that.
WILLIAM =>  Why not? How much did you get?
HANNAH => I did OK. Leave it at that. What's important is that I owe this success to all of you. I would be lost without this writing group.
JOHN =>  I don't know if anyone heard.
JOHN => But U.R. the Publisher has agreed to publish Roaring Lion by John K. Butzin.
ALAN => U.R. the Publisher?
HENRY => They self-publish. E-books. Print on Demand.
JOHN => That's right, Obert. But I'll have my book in two weeks. None of this B.S. waiting around. John K. Butzin will be a published author. And be published first.
HANNAH =>  Well, John. Congratulations.
ALAN => My, two published authors in the group. The rest of us are going to have to catch up.
JOHN =>  Gunner stared out over the bleak horizon, seeing one dead Viet Cong after another lay scattered on the bloody hillside. He had won this time, but Gunner knew Charlie would be back in the morning. By god, he would be ready. So would his M60 General Purpose Machine Gun and Mark 2 Fragmentation/Hand Rifle Grenade.
ALAN => OK, John. Nicely done. Let's get some feedback.
HENRY => Well.   In terms of the characters--
JOHN =>  --Hold on, Obert. I wanna hear from her.
ALAN => We'll hear from everybody.
JOHN => I don't want to hear from everybody. She has a book coming out. John K. Butzin has a book coming out. I want to hear from Hannah, author to author.
WILLIAM => Oh, screw you.
ALAN => This is really going against the spirit of the group, John. Everyone's opinion is valid.
JOHN => Hers is more valid. What'd you think, Hannah? Tell me.
HANNAH => I-I . . .
WILLIAM =>  Going outside for a smoke.
COLETTE => I'll go talk to him.
ALAN => Let's take a fifteen minute break, shall we?
ALAN => Ahhh, idea for Michael Crichton-type novel. Members of Antarctic research station attacked by mutant penguins.
COLETTE => I want you to meet someone special. This is my spiritual adviser. Doctor Xiroman has taken a vow of silence for one full year to protest climate change. What an amazing man. Dr. Xiroman is going to cleanse the air of all this rejection.
WILLIAM => See those jokers back there? 
WILLIAM => They "write" for TV. Town's full of them. Creative vultures. Anything for a paycheck. Fade in. Fade out. C.S.I. 24. Who Wants to Suck My --
WILLIAM => Gimme a break. Television. Telecrap. They've sold their souls to the devil. For what? A house in Malibu? A tennis court?
WILLIAM => That will never be me. I will never compromise my vision for financial gain. I'd rather borrow money from friends than sell out for a quick dollar.
HENRY => "...Gatsby had an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness...
HENRY => "...such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again..."
HENRY => You know, the year before he died, F. 
HENRY => Scott Fitzgerald made a grand total of $13.13 in royalties from his writing. I guess Hannah's right about 13 being unlucky.
HENRY => Sure. Sure. I know that. Gatsby does end tragically. But that's fiction. Hannah...She's real. Our story will have a happy ending.
HENRY => Maybe.   Maybe a happy ending.
HENRY => Hope. Hope we have a happy ending. Fingers crossed.
ALAN => There's been one rule in this house. Whatever Colette wants, Colette gets.
COLETTE => Thank you, Alan.
ALAN => She wants a Mercedes? No problem. Credit cards? How many? Her own business? Done. An agent?
ALAN => Call it karma or serendipity or kismet. Whatever. But it just so happens that very well-known literary agent David Keller--
COLETTE =>  --Very well-known. He's so known.
ALAN => Exactly. Well, guess who is coming in tomorrow to see Dr. Alan Mooney for an eye examination and new glasses?
COLETTE => I love you, Poodles.
ALAN => Love you more, Poodles.
ALAN => Dr. Alan Mooney.
DAVID =>  Let me call you back.
DAVID => David Keller.
ALAN => I know. Big fan. Big fan.
ALAN => Oh, that. They're doing a little documentary about my writing group.
DAVID => Really?
ALAN => Just act natural.
ALAN => It was supposed to be a reality series.
ALAN => Great. Let's start out with a basic eye examination.
ALAN => OK, David. See if you can read that first line for me, please.
DAVID =>  X7K6AC
ALAN => Very good, David. Would you like to try for what's behind Door Number Three? Try this one, please.
DAVID =>  E2PH8S
ALAN => 20/25. Looking good, David. But anyone can identify simple letters and numbers. Let's see how you do reading a more challenging text.
ALAN => See that?
DAVID => Yes.
ALAN => Good. Read me the first paragraph, please.
DAVID =>  Natasha, the Russian peasant, dressed oh-so-slowly, consumed totally, completely, absolutely, by endless thoughts of Yuri.
ALAN => Oh. Very nice. Very nice. Now the next paragraph, please.
DAVID =>  "I never, ever thought I could feel this way," Natasha said excitedly. "Nor could I," Yuri said happily, his body dripping with enormous beads of sweat.
ALAN => Man. Wow. Gee. Isn't that great writing? My wife Colette wrote that. The patients just love reading her stuff. It's from her new novel, Nyet, Not Yet.
ALAN => My, I wonder who that could be.
COLETTE => Hi, honey.   So sorry to intrude.
ALAN => Colette? Gee, this is an incredible coincidence. We were just talking about you. And here you are!
COLETTE =>  Hello.
ALAN => Oh, where are my manners? Colette, this is David Keller. David, this is my wife, Colette Mooney. The writer.
DAVID => Hi.
COLETTE => Pleasure to meet you, David.
ALAN => Actually, Colette wrote this beautiful prose you've been reading, David. Honey, I can't believe this coincidence.
COLETTE => Well, I was just dropping off--
ALAN =>  Oh, of course. Thanks for bringing it by. Say, honey, David's been reading that first page of yours. You don't happen to have any more of that opening chapter, do you?
COLETTE => As a matter of fact, I think I do. I think I do.
ALAN => Say, how about that?
DAVID => How about that?
COLETTE => That went very well.
ALAN => Oh, yes, Poodles.    Very.
COLETTE => Though David Keller did seem in a hurry to leave.
ALAN => The sooner he can begin reading.
COLETTE => I bet he calls tomorrow with an offer.
ALAN => I bet he calls tonight.
COLETTE =>  I did it.
ALAN =>  We did it.
HANNAH => Henry.     This is good.   So good.
HENRY => Really?
HENRY => But I've only got 100 pages.      Can't seem to move forward.
HANNAH => I'm dying to know more about Scott and Christy. What great characters.
HENRY => Yeah. Sure wish I knew what was going to happen with them.
HANNAH => You'll figure it out, Henry. It'll pass. Focus on your writing. No distractions. The writing comes first.
HENRY => Say, um, remember I offered to drive you around and show you a couple special places?
HANNAH => Who lives here?
HENRY => Richard Benedict.
HANNAH => Oh.   That writer you like?
HENRY => Like? No. It's much more than that. Wow. He...He...
HENRY => ...Reading Richard Benedict...made me want to be a better writer. He's that good, Hannah.
HANNAH => Can't say I've read his stuff.     Nice house, though.
HENRY => Here we are.
HENRY => North Hayworth Avenue. Hollywood, California.
HENRY => Big clue time. Sheila Graham.
HENRY => OK. Give up? Writer Sheila Graham lived here. Fitzgerald was her lover. This is where he died on December 21, 1940.
HANNAH => Fitzgerald? He's the one who shot himself, right?
HENRY => No. Fitzgerald. F. Scott Fitzgerald. He wrote The Great Gatsby.
HENRY =>  Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's--
HANNAH =>  I've never read it.
HENRY => What?
HANNAH =>  Could you turn that off for a few minutes, please?
HENRY => You know they can't. What's wrong?
HANNAH => I've never read The Great Gatsby.
HENRY => You're kidding.
HANNAH => Henry. I never went to college. I've heard of Hemingway. A little. Fitzgerald. Somewhere. But I don't have your education. Your smarts. I haven't read all these great novels. My stories come from my heart.
HANNAH => Tell me about the book.
HENRY => Gatsby is about social position and the American Dream and . . .
HENRY => Actually, it's quite simple. Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy moves heaven and earth to win the girl back.
HANNAH => And it's your favorite?
HANNAH => So how does it end? Does boy get the girl?
HENRY => Here. Take my copy.
HENRY => Now you can find out for yourself.
JOHN =>  Yes. I'm still holding. Where are you again? New Dehli? Oh.
JOHN =>  Butzin. John K. Butzin. Right. That's me. Roaring Lion. Yes. Well, I have a copy of my book you sent, but there must be some mistake...Well, you put a dog on the cover. Not a lion like we agreed.
JOHN =>  Plus the back cover is written in Chinese. Chinese...Yes, I know Chinese when I see it. One of those Chinese assault rifles almost cost me an eye at Hamburger Hill...
JOHN => I seem to be missing pages 1-0-7 to 1-1-2...Yes, I'm sure. And what in blazes is this Chapter Eight?
JOHN =>  This Chapter Eight isn't mine. It's about hormone replacement for women. Do you think John K. Butzin would write that? Must be from another goddamn book. So what the hell you going to do about this? You, sir, are dealing with a decorated veteran-- a combat veteran--of the United States Army.
JOHN => Yes. I'll hold.
JOHN =>  Minor details. That's all. All that truly matters is that John K. Butzin is finally a published author.
EUDORA => Great book.    Classic.
HANNAH => Oh, I needed this break. Thank you, Henry.
HENRY => You're welcome.
HANNAH => It's just that I'm starting to feel the pressure, you know? There is so much riding on this first book.
HENRY => Don't be silly. Sleeping on the Moon will hit the bestseller list. You'll be the toast of the literary world. And I'll come over to Beverly Hills and deliver a pizza to you.
HANNAH => Beverly Hills, ah...
HENRY => Definitely.
HANNAH => What a dear, sweet friend you are.
HANNAH =>  No distractions. The writing comes first, 'kay?
ALAN => Alright.   Whose turn is it to read? Henry?
HENRY => Oh. Um. Someone else go. I don't have anything new ready tonight.
COLETTE => It's been weeks, Henry.
HENRY => I know.   Still can't focus.
JOHN => Don't be a pussy, Obert. Get writing. Complete the mission.
HANNAH => Writer's block can be very serious, John.
WILLIAM => What's so hard, bro'? I mean, you've got Scott and Christy. Two friends. Tell their story.
HENRY => That's the problem. I think the story's changing.
ALAN => Changing?   How so?
HENRY => Lately I'm feeling something much deeper, much richer. Scott and Christy, um, growing closer.
COLETTE => Christy's a beautiful, wealthy author in Beverly Hills. How close can they get?
HENRY => Follow me. Something happens. Christy has an epiphany. She-She realizes her feelings run much deeper now for Scott.
WILLIAM => Nah.    Don't buy it.
JOHN => They're friends. Why muck it up? Don't put 'em in the same foxhole.
COLETTE => Is this Scott wanting to go beyond the friendship? There's no way Christy would suggest it. What do you think, Hannah?
ALAN => Yes. Hannah, what do you think?
HANNAH => Gee, I-I guess...I really never thought of them that way.
HENRY => Never?
HANNAH => No. It's always been a friendship.
HENRY => You don't see anything possibly happening between them?
HANNAH => No.    Friends. Nothing more.
WILLIAM => Exactly.
HANNAH => I'd be uncomfortable with any changes in the relationship.
HENRY => OK. Thanks, everyone. I'll try to have something on paper next time.
JOHN => Remember, Obert. Complete the mission.
WILLIAM =>  Got a sec?
HANNAH => How much?
HANNAH => But if I loaned you money, then I wouldn't have it.
WILLIAM => Hey, I just figured, you know. You got that big advance. Help out a fellow writer. I'm good for it, Hannah.
HANNAH => Sorry. It's bad luck to loan money.
WILLIAM => OK, then, just give it to me.
COLETTE => How much do you need?
JOHN => This is a big moment. Roaring Lion has been posted on Amazon.com. Now all books. Your fiction. Your nonfiction. They're ranked on Amazon by sales. Obviously everyone wants to be number one. They say a book is selling well on Amazon if it's in the top 5000. Time to run it up the flag pole. Sigrid?
SIGRID =>  2,472,899 . . .
SIGRID => Tom Clancy.    32.
HANNAH => How am I doing? OK. Sort of. Brian called. Looks like there's real interest in movie rights for Sleeping on the Moon. Yeah, thanks.
HANNAH => But I don't dare say anything to the group. They find out I've got a movie deal--I don't know. I'm sensing enough jealousy as it is, you know? Could be awkward if they found out. It's a real--what's that word?
MAUREEN => Conundrum.
HANNAH => That's it.    I'm in one.
HANNAH =>  "Please come home, Michael." "Why would you want to marry me, Kyra? I barely graduated high school." "Michael, I don't care about some silly college degree. You're the most intelligent person I've ever known. You are my shining star."
ALAN => OK.   Comments. Anyone?
HANNAH => I value your feedback.    We're all in this together, right?
HANNAH => Colette--Did the new scene work for you?
COLETTE => Oh...Gee...Hannah. What? I mean, you're being published. This is being published.
HANNAH => But my editor wants rewrites.      Am I on track?
ALAN => Of course you are, Hannah.
WILLIAM => You got the deal. You got the check. First one to be published.
ALAN => I think what I'm hearing from the group is...is...you're fine. We all love it. Nothing here to critique. You don't need us--well, it's not that you don't need us, but, you know...
HANNAH => What do you think, Henry?
HENRY => Yes. Actually, it is really good, but there are a couple things--little things--I'd point out. For example--
JOHN => Holy Douglas MacArthur --
JOHN =>  "Hollywood decides to go sleeping on the moon. 
JOHN => First-time scribe Hannah Rinaldi, repped by Brian Barkley of SoHo, scores six-figure movie deal. Ink is still fresh, but Barkley boasts keen interest by..."
ALAN => Idea for novel. Perhaps screenplay. The Amazing Doctor Eckleburg. An eye doctor turned crime fighter. Ladies man.
ALAN => William?
WILLIAM => Hey.   Alan.
WILLIAM => Just, um. Just stopped by to...read some pages for Colette. Yeah.
HENRY => Hannah's avoiding me. She doesn't respond to emails or voice messages. She's "busy." Always an excuse.
HENRY => Things have definitely changed between us. I did get to go to her place for dinner last night.
HENRY => Hannah wasn't there. She was in New York with her publisher. But Maureen and I had a lovely time.
COLETTE => Yes. You noticed. I replaced the photo. I may be replacing other things around here soon...I was just using William...for research.
COLETTE => Speaking of rejection...three more letters saying Nyet, including one from David Keller. I should have offered him a massage. How much more rejection can I take?
COLETTE =>  "We keep going back, stronger, not weaker, because we will not allow--
COLETTE => --Rejection to beat us down--
COLETTE => --It will only strengthen our resolve. To be successful there is no other way." Mr. Henry D. Thoreau.
COLETTE => Rejection sucks.
JOHN => This is going to be a great day for John K. Butzin. Yes, sir. First official book signing.
JOHN => Ready and raring to go. Of course, it would have been better to do this in an actual bookstore, but, hell, they're dropping faster than Charlie at Dak To. Not to worry. Since Sigrid works at the hardware store, they're going to let her favorite author sign a few books there.
SIGRID => More than a few books. Many, many books, Ja?
JOHN => Ja, my Strudel. Many books.
SIGRID =>  Attention shoppers. Famous author, Mr. John K. Bootzin, signing new best seller. Up front of store. John K. Bootzin. Also, special today in plumbing department. Ballcocks. Two for one. All customers guaranteed will be satisfied. Ja.
JOHN => Sorry, Strudel. Seem to be shooting blanks today.
ALAN => Author!    Author!
JOHN => Hey-Hey. The cavalry's arrived. Look who's here.
SIGRID => Hello, everyone!
HANNAH => Wouldn't miss your signing, John.
COLETTE => Smile, John!
HENRY => Congratulations, John.
JOHN => Thanks, Obert. Where's the Bukowski wannabe?
HANNAH => William said he'd meet us here.
JOHN => What a turd.     Never liked that punk anyway.
ALAN => Maybe he's still at our house.
COLETTE => Maybe he is.     Maybe I should go see.
ALAN => Maybe you should.
HENRY => This is in Chinese.
SIGRID => International edition!
ALL =>  Oh...
JOHN => Know what the hardware store manager said? He said today was their most successful book signing. Ever.
JOHN => This was their first book signing? Oh.
JOHN => Well, John K. Butzin set the bar pretty high for the next writer, let me tell ya. That's right: 1-2-3-4-5- 6-7-8-9-10-11. Eleven books sold.
JOHN => Oh, that's right, Strudel. You borrowed one at the store to help prop open the side door. I forgot.
SIGRID => Ja...
JOHN => Ten books. But there are now at least ten homes in California where folks have books by Melville. Hemingway. Clancy. And now Butzin. It's a humbling thought.
ALAN => I've made an important decision as group leader. I've decided to ask William to leave the group. Now it has absolutely nothing to do with that incident at our house. It has nothing to do with the fact that I'm now sleeping in the guest room. But let's face it--the kid's a slacker. No contribution to the group. Zero. Zip. Nada. I'm sure he'll be fine with it.
ALAN => There's no need to get so upset.
WILLIAM => Fine. I was going to quit anyway. Leave this bunch of losers.
WILLIAM => Christ. You and your stupid recorder. And your stupid ideas. And your stupid character names.
WILLIAM => Name for character. Bobby Blow Me. Gimme a break.
WILLIAM => And G.I. Joe over here with that piece-of-crap, self-published tripe. Who are you kidding?
ALAN => Just ignore him.
WILLIAM => Colette, Colette, my pet. News Flash for you: Oprah's not calling--unless she needs a massage. Get real!
JOHN => Oprah?   She's not on TV anymore.
COLETTE => I know that.
WILLIAM => The great Henry O. Man, you got the gift, bro'. But your head is up your ass over poor, sweet, successful Hannah here.
WILLIAM => Hannah. Hannah. Hannah. We could have been so hot together. I'm just as good a writer as you are, but you sure look better in a skirt --
HENRY =>  That's enough.
WILLIAM => I don't need any of you. I don't need any of your pointless, pedestrian feedback. I'm a writer.
JOHN => You've got goddamn three pages.
WILLIAM => They're a great three pages! You just don't appreciate my dedication.
HANNAH => You're a pretend writer, William.
HENRY => She's right. You act the part. You like the lifestyle. You hit on women. You quote Bukowski. But Bukowski did the work. Each and every day he wrote. That's your problem, William. You don't do the work.
WILLIAM => I don't do the work? Man, that sounds frickin' hilarious coming from you. When's the last time you wrote anything?
ALAN => Not the sign!
ALAN => Let's move on. Next item. Richard Benedict is going to be doing a signing at Wordsmith next week.
ALAN => Who wants to go?
ALAN => Idea for novel. Jealous husband murders his tramp-of-a-wife and buries her chopped-up body in the back yard.
HENRY =>  Mr. Benedict, I just want to thank you. No. You've inspired my writing-- No. Hi. I'm Henry. I just think you're the greatest...
COLETTE => Let me tell you something, Henry.
COLETTE => One day, I'll have a signing like this.
JOHN => Nope. Not going to see Richard whatever-his-name-is. John K. Butzin, author, doesn't need to stand in line anymore. No, sir. This soon- to-be best-selling writer is spending every minute, every dollar, on promoting Roaring Lion.
JOHN => Strudel, check my sales ranking again.
SIGRID =>  1,644,973 . . .
JOHN => Wow. Look how far I've moved up already.
SIGRID => John Grisham. 12.
ALAN => He's older than I thought.
HANNAH => I've never seen him before.
HENRY =>  Pleasure to meet you. No. Honor to meet you. He She They is my favorite novel.
CLERK => Next, please.
RICHARD =>  What?!
CLERK =>  Sir?
CLERK => Sir? We need to keep the line moving. Sir?
RICHARD =>  Absolutely not! I'll sue that bastard first...
ALAN => We need to move, Henry.
COLETTE => Hi there.
RICHARD =>  Damn it! That simply won't--
RICHARD => Hi.
HANNAH => Hello.
HENRY => So what did he say?
HANNAH => Who?
HENRY => Who!?!? Richard Benedict. You know, the guy who just held up the line for five minutes talking to you?
ALAN =>  Ten. It was closer to ten minutes.
HANNAH => I don't know. We just talked.
HENRY => He sure liked you.
HANNAH => We just talked, Henry. I mentioned my book. He started asking about it. Writer to writer. No big deal.
HENRY => No big deal? Talking to Richard Benedict. No big deal!
ALAN => You gave him your phone number.
HANNAH => Look, a guy like that reads more books in a week than I ever have. Why would he bother call--
HANNAH =>  Hello? Who? Richard? Oh. Richard. Hi.
COLETTE => Unbelievable.
HANNAH =>  Coffee? Oh, God. I don't know, Richard. I really appreciate the invitation, but--
HANNAH => This isn't a good time. Call me later. Yes. I'll think about it. Yes. Bye.
ALAN => Amazing.
COLETTE => This isn't fair. This just isn't fair.
HANNAH => What?
COLETTE => First, you get an agent. Then you sell your book. Then the big movie deal.
ALAN => Please don't.
COLETTE => No. This isn't fair. And now Richard Benedict wants to have coffee with you? All this is happening to you. And only you. Isn't there anything -- I don't know--some kind of cosmic creative crumb for the rest of us to nibble on?
HANNAH => I don't like what you're suggesting, Colette. You know how hard I work. How devoted I am. And I have been totally supportive of your writing. I've encouraged you all along.
COLETTE => You wouldn't introduce me to your agent.
HANNAH => Brian didn't want to meet you. I asked.
ALAN => Hannah has earned her success.
COLETTE => Butt out Mr. Idea Man.
ALAN => Hannah is a writer. She devotes herself one hundred percent to writing. Not one hundred percent to sleeping with writers.
HENRY => Why don't you two just go on ahead?
COLETTE => It's not fair that she be the only one.
HENRY => Go.
ALAN => C'mon.    Let's go.
COLETTE => 13! 13!    13!     13!
COLETTE => I know. I'm a shit for exploding at Hannah, aren't I?
COLETTE => Poor, sweet, superstitious, everybody- loves-Hannah.
COLETTE => If she can succeed, so can I. "We were born to succeed, not to fail."
COLETTE => Who said that? I don't know. Somebody famous. Somebody with an agent.
COLETTE => I can't accomplish anything without an agent. They won't come to me. Fine. I'll go to them. I'll make it happen.
HANNAH => Your writer's block?
HENRY => Yeah.
HANNAH => It's because your focus is always on everything else. Gatsby. Fitzgerald. Me.
HANNAH => Listen to me, Henry Obert. Your writing must come first. Take this passion you have. Put it on the page. Forget everything else. All you're doing is wasting...
HENRY => She's right. But I know what's really happening here. Hannah's telling me she has every intention of talking to Richard Benedict. She has every intention of seeing him.
JOHN => Wow! All the books sold at the hardware store?
SIGRID => Ja.   Every one.
JOHN => Didn't I tell you, Strudel?   Write it and they will read.
JOHN => Get some more copies down there. Maybe do another signing. Yeah. No. Time for a real tour. Fresno. Bakersfield. Stockton. Call a few bookstores. Let 'em know John K. Butzin is coming. Lock and load.
SIGRID => Bye.   Bye.
COLETTE => I have to see Ms. Piper. We just need five minutes. 1-2-3-4-5 minutes of her time.
COLETTE => Can you just please stick your head in her office, tell her that Colette Mooney is here. I know she's busy, but she'll certainly want to see my manuscript.
COLETTE =>  I'm a graduate of Mills College.
LOIS => If I have to read one more vampire story, I swear I'll drive a stake through my own goddamn heart.
LOIS => Vampires! Zombies! Harry Potter knock-offs! People writing about their dogs! Just shoot me now!
COLETTE => Ms. Piper?   Ms. Piper?
LOIS => Dr. Xiroman. I can't believe you're here. How lovely to see you again.
LOIS => Just in the neighborhood? Please come in for a minute.
LOIS => My family talks about you all the time. You were so helpful to my sister. She's doing much better.
LOIS =>  Look at my desk, Dr. Xiroman. Look at all this. Do you know what it is? Crap. It's all crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. I hate my job. I hate my life.
LOIS => Know what I feel like doing?
LOIS => Come in closer. I want you to get this. Closer. C'mon. More. Closer.
LOIS => Wheeeeee!
LOIS => That was so...liberating. I haven't felt this good since that night in Paris with Salman Rushdie.
LOIS => I envy you, Dr. Xiroman. Know that? Look at your life. Your work. You helped my sister. You've helped so many people. You have such a positive message to share.
LOIS => Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. A positive message to share. Helping people. That's it!
COLETTE =>  What?
LOIS => Of course. Dr. Xiroman, you should write a book. This could be a whole series.
COLETTE => But--
LOIS => --It's perfect! Television. Your own blog. Personal appearances.
COLETTE => But--
LOIS => Getting from Xiro to One by Doctor Xiroman. Oh, I like that.
COLETTE => But--
LOIS => --In fact, as long as you're here today, why don't we just get you under contract? I know just who to call in New York.
COLETTE => But--But.   What about me?
COLETTE => Co-Authors. Actually I'll be listed as junior author. It's not exactly what I wanted, but at least now I finally have an agent. And a book deal.
COLETTE => My novel will have to wait a while longer. Nyet, Colette. Not Yet. But soon.
HENRY => Shit!
RICHARD => You're late, Pizza Boy.
RICHARD => What the --
HENRY =>  They're with me. Your total comes to nineteen dollars and sixty-five cents.
RICHARD => Babe, I need a single.
RICHARD => C'mon, babe. Got a dollar for Pizza Boy?
WOMAN => Coming!
HANNAH => Here you--
HENRY => No distractions. The writing comes first.
HANNAH => He's making me a better writer.
HENRY => Yeah.    I bet he is.
HENRY => How much better are you, Hannah? Show us. Who wrote Slaughterhouse Five? D'ya know?
HANNAH => Henry.    Don't.
HENRY => No, No. This could be quite educational. How about Native Son? Catch-22?
HANNAH => Why isn't it enough that I'm your friend?
HENRY => Lord of the Flies? Portnoy's Complaint? Do you know any author? Harry Potter--You must know Harry Potter.
HANNAH => Why isn't it enough that I believe in your writing?
HENRY => --Sophie's Choice? Anything published in the English language.
HANNAH => --That I believe in you?
HENRY => You didn't read Gatsby, did you? Never even opened it, I bet.
HANNAH => I'm not--
HANNAH => I'm not the one delivering pizzas for a living.
HANNAH => I'm not the one wasting my talent. You've read all those books, sure, but my book is being published. Is yours?
JOHN => Well, Strudel shipped out.
JOHN => Oh, she wanted to stay, but... I didn't have time for a relationship. Not with my book selling like it is. She, well, she became collateral damage. Hated to end it. What a dame. I mean...Sigrid. She had the smarts of my first wife. The body of my second wife. Thank god she wasn't anything like my third wife. I did the right thing. Yes, sir.
JOHN => What matters now is that the Roaring Lion book tour is about to begin. Can't wait to hit the road and meet the good people of this nation. Good American people.
HENRY => Sorry I'm late.
JOHN => Wutch you got here, Obert?
HENRY => New pages.   I'm ready to read.
ALAN => Way to go, Henry.
JOHN => Christ.   What's he doing here?
COLETTE => I've invited Doctor Xiroman to join our writing group.
ALAN => You must be joking, Colette.
COLETTE => I am not joking. And, as a matter of fact, I'll have all of you know that the doctor and I are soon to be published authors. We've signed with The Lois Piper Agency.
HENRY => You can't do this.
COLETTE => Why not? With William gone, we have an opening.
ALAN => Henry's right. We all have to agree on new members.
COLETTE => I don't care about your silly rules.
ALAN => I am the leader of the group--
COLETTE => --Oh, please. Alan.
ALAN =>  I am the leader of the group.
COLETTE => And Dr. Xiroman is my co-author and he is joining "the group."
ALAN => He is not.
COLETTE => He is.
ALAN => Is not.
COLETTE => Is.
ALAN => Is n--
HANNAH =>  STOP!
HANNAH => I'm leaving.
HANNAH => It's time. Richard is going to mentor me. Today's the 22nd. Two plus two equals four and we all know four's...
HANNAH => Anyway, I'm quitting.
COLETTE => Well, in this case one plus one equals one very successful writing team. I can't believe you, Hannah. You're doing this just to upstage our news about landing an agent.
ALAN => Stop it...
COLETTE => No, this is what it's all about. The spotlight always has to be on Little Miss Sunshine. Her agent. Her book deal. Her movie deal.
JOHN => News flash for you all. John K. Butzin is also saying Sayonara. Heading off on my international book tour.
HENRY => International?
JOHN => Damn straight. Tijuana.  I'm done with you pussies.
ALAN => Get out.    Now.
ALAN => As the leader of this writing group, I've determined your actions are contrary to our stated purpose. Get out.
COLETTE => You can't kick me out.    I live here.
ALAN => Fine.   Then go to your room.
ALAN => And take him with you. Won't be the first guy.
COLETTE => We'll certainly have plenty to discuss in therapy.
ALAN => Go by yourself. I'm done.
COLETTE => Oh. Just like always--Alan finishes first.
COLETTE => Come, Dr. Xiroman. I'm looking forward to working with a real doctor. On our new book.
ALAN => Idea for novel.
ALAN => Here. Take it. Maybe you can use some of my ideas in your novel.
ALAN =>  This was supposed to be a reality series.
HANNAH => Henry . . .
HANNAH => Exciting, isn't it? I'm so nervous. I don't know half these people. Most of them are Richard's friends.
HANNAH => Nobody's showed up from my old writing group. Not one. Probably shouldn't be surprised. Haven't really heard from anyone in months.
HANNAH => Favorite writer? You keep asking me that. Too funny. Sorry. Still can't think of one.
HANNAH => Oh my God!
HENRY => Hi, Hannah.
HANNAH => Henry. Ohhhhh. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming.
HANNAH => You're the only one from the group who showed up.
HANNAH => I can't believe you remembered my signing.
HENRY => Well, pretty hard to miss that article about you in People magazine. Just wanted to say hi. And congratulations.
MAUREEN => Hello, Henry.  Hannah, come back. Your public awaits.
HENRY => Go on. They need you.
HANNAH => Please stay.
HENRY => Can't.   Sorry.
HANNAH => Oh.
HENRY => Yeah. Hot date. You know. Can't keep her waiting. A flight attendant.
HANNAH =>  A flight attendant?
HANNAH => Well, then.     Guess you can't stay.
HENRY => Sorry.
HANNAH => One sec.   Wait here.
HANNAH => This is for you.
HENRY =>  Hannah . . .
HANNAH => Take it.
HANNAH => Do you want to say hello to Richard?
HENRY => No. No, thanks.
HANNAH => C'mon. It will take just a minute.
HENRY => I can't.   Really.
MAUREEN => Dear, sweet Hannah. Please!
HANNAH => Just say hi.
HENRY => I've really got to --
HANNAH => Oh, c'mon.   You'll --
HENRY => Well, I did it. I showed up to Hannah's signing. I congratulated her. I supported her, writer to writer. And I finally got introduced to Richard Benedict--formally. Sort of.
HENRY => Look. Hannah dedicated her novel to me. Just like she promised.
DAVID => This is why I love LA. True story. This guy delivers a pizza to my house one night. Then the very next week, my wife has someone come in and clean the carpets. Guess what? Same guy. Small world, isn't it? So we get talking. He tells me his name's Henry. He's a writer. He's just finished a manuscript. Offers us a discount on the carpets if I'll read ten pages. I like that thinking. So I read ten pages. Wow. I want to read ten more. Before I know it, I've read the entire book. 
DAVID => Just loved it. Fresh voice. Interesting characters. And that ending.
DAVID => The washed-up, impotent novelist getting gunned down by Scott, the jealous, underemployed, pizza delivery man. This kid nailed it. It's on the page, know what I mean? So I intend to sign Mr. Henry Obert and get Pizza to Go out there. I predict a best seller. Probably a movie, too. I'll call him with the good news. Or maybe I'll just order a pizza.
HENRY => David Keller did call me. One week later, he sold Pizza to Go to a New York publisher. They decided to rename it A Slice of LA. I did it. I sold my novel.
HENRY => I miss the Tuesday night group. They made me a better writer. They taught me how to handle rejection.
HENRY => Hannah was right. The writing must always come first. Everything else waits. Everything. That's what I did finally. Finished my novel. 
HENRY => Sold it. Now? Now I'm open. Ready for whatever--
HENRY => --happens next...
EUDORA => Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--
HENRY =>  --Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further...
HENRY => You know Fitzgerald?
EUDORA => Not intimately. He died here, you know.
HENRY => December 21, 1940.
EUDORA => I go by there sometimes.
HENRY => The place on Hayworth.
EUDORA => Is that weird. That I do that?
HENRY => No. No. Not at all.
EUDORA => OK. Good. Because, you know, I don't want people to think I'm weird.
HENRY => Of course not. Do you write?
EUDORA => Kinda, sort of. But I'm thinking of joining a writing group.
EUDORA => So what's this? Some kind of reality show, or something?
JOHN => After a very successful book tour, John K. Butzin heard the Grand Canyon State calling. This is home now.
JOHN => Real God-fearing Americans live here. Good people. Not those La La pussies.
CHILDREN => Trick or Treat!
JOHN => Look at this treat you get. A copy of Roaring Lion by John K. Butzin. Happy Halloween.
WILLIAM => C'mon. Admit it. You missed me. It wasn't as interesting once I left, right?
WILLIAM => I knew the group wouldn't last without me. No way. Losers.
WILLIAM => Him? Oh. It's my new project. A reality TV show based on my life. You know...women I meet...thoughts that pop into my head. Kid follows me all around. 24/7. Actually I got the idea from you guys. Same concept-- just better characters.
WILLIAM => Which network? Um, well...it's a...it's P-P-A...Pasadena Public Access. Oh, people watch. Yeah. We're on right after that pet psychic.
WILLIAM => Thanks, babe.
WILLIAM => Get a close-up on her. Nice and tight.
WILLIAM => And, hey, Kid. Lend me five bucks. I want to leave an extra special tip.
ALAN => After I sent Colette packing, I was ready for a new chapter in my life...
ALAN => I found it teaching Adult Ed. "Writing 20/20" is the class. Helping writers to see. Inspired by my new self- published e-book of the same title.
ALAN => OK. You've got ten seconds. Write down the name of your character. First name that pops into mind. C'mon. Tell me your character.
ALAN => 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-9.5-9.75-10 seconds. OK. Pass your names up front here. Let's see what you came up with.
ALAN => The right name is so important for your character. OK. What do we have?
ALAN => Here's one I haven't heard. Heywood Ja-Jabloom???
ALAN => Or is it Jablom? Maybe Jablowme. Heywood Jablowme?
ALAN => What's so funny? Heywood Jablowme? Am I missing something? Heywood Jablowme?
COLETTE => Dr. Xiroman and I wrote our book. It actually did fairly well.
COLETTE => Dr. Phil turned us down. But we had a lovely time on Anderson.
