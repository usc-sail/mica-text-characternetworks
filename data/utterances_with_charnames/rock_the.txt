BENNIE => You'll get used to him.  Every Sunday morning - rain, snow, holidays nothin, keeps him Away.
HUMMEL => Hi Barb.  The house sold yesterday.  I know, I know, the market's depressed. Anyway, I'm leaving the area.  Some things I have to do.  Things I couldn't do while you were here.  Maybe you would have approved.  Hell, I know you wouldn't have.  I've tried everything and I can't seem to get their attention.  But now they'll learn how it feels on the other side.  Let's hope it elevates their thinking.
HUMMEL => Held better be.  This is a security inspection.
COLONEL CALLAHAN => General Hummel!  This is a surprise!
HUMMEL => That's the idea, Colonel.
SGT.  CRISP => This is a security exercise, sir. We've fully breached and infiltrated your compound.  I'm afraid you and your men are my prisoners, sir.
SGT.  CRISP => Sorry sir, you realise the importance of these exercises.
HUMMEL =>  Ten men who could have been terrorists are out there doing whatever they damn well please to your compound, Colonel.  Here you sit with your ass chained to a fucking radiator.  This is not a tight ship.  I would not want to be in your shoes in the morning.
ISHERWOOD =>  Son of a bitch...
GOODSPEED =>  You owe me five dollars, Marvin.
ISHERWOOD =>  I was told this was exciting work.
GOODSPEED => Patience, Marvin.  It has its moments.
C'mere, Billy. =>  A dog at J.F.K. got a whiff of something postmarked to a Bosnian refugee camp.  Could be detergent, could be seran gas.
ISHERWOOD => Bosnian refugee camp?  I don't get it.
GOODSPEED => Half a million Serbians reside in the U.S., Marvin.  Serbians don't like Bosnians.  Read a newspaper.  It's good for you.  Hold out your hand.
ISHERWOOD => I'm okay.  Really.  Let's do it-
GOODSPEED => Coal miners use canaries, we use those. Sorry guys.
DR. LING =>  We have airlock, Bill.  Proceed.
GOODSPEED =>  July 1, 0.900 hours, agent william Goodspeed and agent/trainee Marvin Isherwood.  Initiating exam of a wooden crate.  Suspicion of seran gas device inside.
GOODSPEED => Appears to be kitchen items, cleaning agents, and... (lifts out a sweatshirt) ... old clothes.
ISHERWOOD => This is thrilling.
GOODSPEED => Careful, goddamn it Marvin!
ISHERWOOD => What's hap...  what's happening....?
DR. LING => Don't panic, Bill. 50 seconds and the gas will clear.  You're okay.
GOODSPEED => I've got some bad news and some really bad news.  The bad news is the gas is corrosive.  It's eating our suits.
DR. LING => What's the really bad news.
GOODSPEED => Enough C-4 explosive to blow the chamber and enough poison gas to kill everybody in the building.
ISHERWOOD => The acid's eating...  it's eating my fucking suit...
GOODSPEED => Chill, Marvin.  WHERE'S THE GODDAMN SPRINKLERS?
DR. LONNER => Something's blocking the pipes, Bill.  When in Christ's name are they gonna give us a new building ...
DR. LING => Get the atropine, Isherwood. The atropine, Marvin.
DR. LING => You die, we all die, Bill.  Inject yourself, then diffuse it.  Goddamn it, Bill, take the antidote.
GOODSPEED => Get that away from me.  I hate needles.
DR. LING => INJECT YOURSELF!
GOODSPEED => LONNER, WHERE'S THE GODDAMNED WATER?
DR. LONNER => It's coming, it's coming ...
DR.  LING =>  Ten seconds, Bill.
ISHERWOOD => Oh fuck oh shit oh fuck THIS IS LIKE FUCKING PULP FICTION ONLY IT'S REAL.
DR. LING => Five seconds, Bill, four seconds, Jesus Christ ...
DR. LING => Three, two...  the gas is clear!
DR. LING => Next time use the atropine!
GOODSPEED => I don't like needles.
CARLA => Every little dream I dream about you, Every little song I sing about you, It drives me crazy when you go away, Wanna keep you locked up at home ...
CARLA =>  Hey there.
GOODSPEED => Hey honey.
CARLA => Wrote a new song.  Wanna hear it?
GOODSPEED => Not now.
CARLA => Boy, somebody's in a bad mood.
GOODSPEED => Yeah, somebody's in a bad mood.
CARLA => Better?
GOODSPEED => Much better. She sits with him.  Puts her arm around him.
CARLA => What happened baby.  Tell me.
GOODSPEED => Had a close one.
CARLA => You want to talk about it?
GOODSPEED => Not really.
CARLA => You know how I feel about what you do.
GOODSPEED => Could we change the subject?
CARLA => That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
GOODSPEED => Hey!  Now there's some good news.
CARLA => You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
GOODSPEED => Carla Pestalozzi?  No. Definitely not.  You could have posed for the Mona Lisa.  Sophia Loren looks Swedish next to you.  I hope that's a compliment.  I could change my name.  How 'bout Bobby Sue Pestalozzi?  Billy io Pestalozzi?
GOODSPEED => Stick with Carla.
CARLA => Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
GOODSPEED => We've talked about this, Carla, we've talked it up, down, inside and out ...
CARLA => Billy, this probably isn't the best time ... Bill, I'm uhhh.
CARLA => I'm pregnant.
FEMALE TOURIST => Is it really true no one escaped?
SGT.  CRISP => Big problem.
HUMMEL => Not today.  You go ahead.
HUMMEL => I think so.
TOURISTS => Hey, what are you doing... ? -- wait a minute, what's going on... ?
CAPTAIN FRYE => General Hummel: Captains Frye and Darrow.
HUMMEL => Deploy as planned, Captain.
HUMMEL => Hello Ladies and Gentlemen.  You are my prisoners.  I have no intention of harming you.  You will be fed regularly.  That is all you need to know for now.
AGENT WOOD =>  In that?
AGENT WOOD => I really think you should take this call personally.
HUMMEL =>  First:    I am holding eighty-one civilian hostages on Alcatraz Island.  Make an excuse to their families and do not alert the media or there will not be eighty.  Second: fifteen guided rockets armed with V.X. poison, are currently aimed at the population of San Francisco.  I will call again at 0-hundred hours and state my demands.
HUMMEL => Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel.
HUMMEL => At ease, Gentlemen.  It is traditional for me to meet with my officers before an operation.  The heart performs one thing, the legs another, the brain another - all better function together or the body becomes ill, is prone to disease.  Major Baxter, Gunny Crisp and I have been on the front lines since 'Nam.' Captain Hendrix was my adjutant in the Gulf.  Get a haircut, Pete, you're lookin' like a beatnik.  You and your men are new to me.
CAPTAIN FRYE => Would the General like a recitation of our service records?
HUMMEL => I'm well aware of your service records, Captain, they are excellent.  I want to be clear on why you - why all of us are here.  You both stand to profit from this.
CAPTAIN FRYE => Profit is not my motive, sir.  I am here to redress a wrong.
CAPTAIN DARROW => Yes, sir, and to learn some people a lesson.
HUMMEL => This country has places where wrongs are redressed, Captain Darrow: They are called courts of law.  In the military, they are called Courts Martial. This country has places where lessons a-re leaned.  They are called schools.  Am I confusing you?
CAPTAIN DARROW => Well, sir, frankly ... EL I see that I am ' 
HUMMEL => The only accurate term for what we are doing here is treason. Plain and simple.  An insurrection against a government to which we have sworn allegiance.  Everyone in this room must understand that.
HUMMEL => The question is what kind of traitor are we.  Coward or lion? Benedict Arnold, or Thomas iefferson?  I have posed that question to myself, have answered it, and my conscience is clear.  Have all of you?
HUMMELS' OFFICERS => Yes, sir.
HUMMEL => Within thirty-two.hours you will leave this country and not return.  All of you can live with that?
OTHER OFFICERS =>  Yes, sir.
HUMMEL => Well, I cannot.  So, regardless of what happens on this island in the hours ahead, I will stay. The men exchange surprised glances.
CAPTAIN HENDRIX => But General, you'll be prosecuted.
HUMMEL => Yes, Captain.  And I plan on conducting my own defense. it will make the O.J. Simpson trial look like an episode of "Perry Mason." Take your posts, gentlemen.  Semper fi.
GENERAL KRAMER => Last night Hummel and eleven marines, under the guise of a security exercise, walked off with fifteen V.X. rockets.  It wasn't discovered until the shift change this morning.
GENERAL KRAMER => Here he is in Vietnam - I think a Major at the time.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR => Four tours in Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm. Three purple hearts... two silver stars and... the Congressional Medal of...  Jesus.  The man is a hero.
GENERAL KRAMER => A legend.  During Tet he held off a brigade of V.C. single-handedly.  Saved his whole company.  Hence the nickname "gunfighter."
RAYDEN SINCLAIR => No.  Give me the skinny.
GENERAL KRAMER => The "skinny," Mr. Sinclair, is that the U.S. should have either won the war or gotten the hell out of Vietnam and stopped wasting American lives.  I happen to share General Hummells view.
NAVAL ATTACHE => General, it's him. The call connects to a phone on the table.
GENERAL KRAMER => Frank, this is Albert Kramer.
HUMMEL => Hello Al.  Howlre Judy and the kids?
GENERAL KRAMER => They're fine.  I'm with General Peterson, F.B.I. Director Womack, Chief of Staff Sinclair, Security Advisor Lindstrom, and C.I.A. Director Amway.  You've got a lot of people worried, Frank. Can you help us out?
HUMMEL => I'll come straight to the point, General Kramer: Eighty-three Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands. Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China ...
HAYDEN SINCLAIR => Southern China?  We never admitted we sent troops into China.
HUMMEL => Who is that.  Identify yourself.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR => White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, General.
HUMMEL => How old are you, white House Chief of Staff Sinclair.
RAYDEN SINCLAIR => I'm thirty-three.
HUMMEL => Well White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, by your ninth birthday I had led over two hundred incursions into China and personally killed that many of the enemy. General, put some duct tape over Mr. sinclair's fat, ignorant mouth.  He has shit for brains and he is wasting my time.
NAVAL ATTACHE => The President calling from Moscow.
GENERAL KRAMER => Continue Frank.
HUMMEL => Eighteen others died in covert, illegal operations in Chile and El Salvador.  Remember the Gulf War.  Those pretty "smart bomb" pictures on C.N.N.? My men lased those targets.  Ten were left to rot outside Baghdad when the conflict ended - and let's not even mention Mogadishu, gentlemen.  No benefits were paid to their families; no medals conferred.  These men died for their country and they weren't even given a coddamn military burial.  This situation will not stand: you will transfer 100 million dollars from a Grand Cayman "Red Sea Trading Company" account to an account I designate.  From these funds, reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83 marines, families.  The rest of the money will pay for my outfit's expenses.  Am I clear?
HUMMEL => Identify yourself.
HUMMEL => You'll be particularly interested: It's a slush fund where the Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.
GENERAL KRAMER => Frank, Jesus, this is classified information.
WOMACK =>  Is this true?
HUMMEL => If you want the money back, you'll have to tell the attorney General and the boys down at Justice where it came from.  Good luck.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR => General, I've just spoken to the President and he is clear as hell on this: We will not negotiate with you and we do not care if ...
HUMMEL => Someone please gag that man.  Alert the media, I launch the gas.  Refuse payment, I launch the gas. It is just after midnight.  You have 36 hours - all of today and half of tomorrow, until 12 noon - to transfer the money.  Don't even consider the standard counter measure, General.
GENERAL KRAMER => What's the potential casualty rate of a single rocket armed with V.X., General Peterson?
GENERAL PETERSON => In a dense urban area, sixty, seventy ...
RAYDEN SINCLAIR => Well that's not so bad ...
GENERAL PETERSON => Napalm.  Standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm. It burns it up -- consumes it upon detonation.  The problem is that V.X. gas is ten times more toxic and designed to withstand napalm. Hummel must know about Willy Peter, General.
GENERAL KRAMER => 'Course he does.  "Willy Peter," short for "White Phosphorous Incendiary Device," still in its test phase.  It detonates at 6,000 degrees, enough to burn up V.X.  That explains Hummells time frame.  He knows we're not operational.  What would it take, General?
GENERAL PETERSON => To equip a flight of F-16s with Willy Peter in 36 hours?  An act of God.  All right, we can try.  But view the use of Willy Peter as a secondary initiative.
GENERAL KRAMER => Then on to our primary initiative. Send in S.E.A.L. Team Leader Anderson.  Who's your best chemical biological man?
AGENT WOOD =>  I'll find out.
CARLA => Don't stop...  do no stop.
GOODSPEED => Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
GOODSPEED => I've got to go to San Francisco.
CARLA => No. I'm sorry, but NO.  I need you here with me.  We need to talk about this...
GOODSPEED => I've got to go. She grabs his arm. I can't...  I cannot deal with this right now ...  Bill, I am very Catholic. And very pregnant.  And very unmarried.  Help me with this.
GOODSPEED => I love you.  I will marry you.  I just didn't plan on this, that's all.  Tell you what: come to San Francisco.
CARLA => Really?  Really?
GOODSPEED => It's probably just a training exercise. Check into a hotel, order up some champagne, I'll finish up my business and ...
CARLA => ... We'll finish what we started.  Baby, are you sexy in those boots ...
COMMANDER ANDERSON => A precision night drop is out due to the full moon. Likewise on a frontal, seaside attack: at the first shot, Hummel might launch.  My second in command is working on an attack from within the prison.  The idea is to penetrate the tunnels under the prison, undetected, emerge in its center, and jump the marines from behind - take their rocket positions without a shot fired.  But I need better intelligence.
GENERAL KRAMER => You've studied the architectural plans.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => They're useless.  Alcatraz was originally a Civil War fort.  It's been ripped up and rebuilt for years.  Under there is a maze of shit, excuse my language.  What I need is personal, firsthand intelligence on the island's tunnels.
GENERAL KRAMER => The former warden?
AGENT WOOD => Died in 1979.  The guards we contacted are useless.  There was a janitor, "Alcatraz Al". He worked there for twenty years, but he died in 1983.
GENERAL PETERSON => Didn't three guys escape?  I thought I saw a movie about it.
AGENT WOOD => It's a Hollywood myth.  No one's escaped Alcatraz and lived.
GOODSPEED => B.A. Columbia.  M.A. and P.H.D., Johns Hopkins, biochemistry and toxicology.
GOODSPEED => This isn't a training exercise, is it sir.
AGENT SANCHEZ => Director, no one's ever escaped from Alcatraz ...
AGENT SANCHEZ => You want him conscious or unconscious afterward?
GOODSPEED => Why's he going to help us now?
AGENT SANCHEZ => Steep price for some information.  I don't need that to get what you want.
AGENT SANCHEZ => It's my middle name.  Watch kid, maybe you'll learn something.
GOODSPEED =>  Jesus look at this guy.
SANCHEZ => I'm F.B.I. Special Agent in Charge Sanchez.
MASON => In charge of what?  Fucking me over for another three decades?
SANCHEZ =>  Hey.  Easy.  I just want to talk.
MASON => You know what F.B.I. stands for Sanchez?  Fucking Bloody Idiots. I don't want to talk to you.
SANCHEZ => Just some questions about Alcatraz.  It's a tourist attraction now.  You remember Alcatraz, Mason.
MASON => Do I remember Alcatraz.
SANCHEZ => Not the island itself.  The tunnels underneath it.
SANCHEZ => There's no harm in cooperating with us.
MASON => Who's "us?" F.B.I.? C.I.A.? Why should I do that?
SANCHEZ => Maybe there's a gift in it for you.
MASON =>  Timeo danaos et dona ferentes.
GOODSPEED => "I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts."
MASON => Are you capable of reading, Sanchez?
SANCHEZ => I don't have time for this shit...  Yes. I can read.
MASON => The story of Alchimadus.  Know it?
SANCHEZ => No.
GOODSPEED =>  Ancient Greece.  Alchimadus was imprisoned by his king.
MASON => Thomas a Beckett.  Heard of him?
SANCHEZ => Maybe.  Not really.
GOODSPEED =>  Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
MASON => Solzhenitsyn.  I've a sneaking suspicion you've heard of him.
GOODSPEED =>  Russian poet and dissident exiled to Siberia.
SANCHEZ => Look, I'm asking the fucking questions here.  You can trust the F.B.I.
MASON => That's a good one, Sanchez.  What do you call and F.B.I. Agent who can't tell a lie?  A mute.
SANCHEZ => Here, call your lawyer and tell him you're going back to jail.
GOODSPEED => You mind if...  uhm....  I take a shot?
SANCHEZ => He'll eat him alive.
GOODSPEED => Take his cuffs off.
MASON => Who the fuck are you, Mother Theresa?
GOODSPEED => No actually, I'm Bill Goodspeed.  Mr. Mason, we really need your help.  That's a pardon and release contract from the Attorney Generals office.  It makes you a free man, provided you cooperate.
MASON => What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
GOODSPEED =>  I'm a field agent.
MASON => Tell me what you really do.
GOODSPEED => I'm a chemical biological weapons expert.
MASON => You said I'd be a free man.  Define free
GOODSPEED => Uhm, well, emancipated.  Unfettered.
MASON => I know what the fucking word means, idiot.  In this context.
GOODSPEED => I don't understand....
MASON => During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
GOODSPEED => Well yes I suppose ...
MASON => You suppose?
GOODSPEED => Yes.  You'll be outside.
MASON => What's happening on Alcatraz, Goodspeed?
GOODSPEED => A hostage situation.  A matter of life and death.
MASON =>  Then on one condition: a minimum of two hours in the Fairmont Hotel - I trust it still exists.  I want a shower and a new suit of clothes.
GOODSPEED => I think we can arrange that.
SANCHEZ => Why didn't you throw in a trip to Fiji?
GOODSPEED => Sir, that's a legal document.
GOODSPEED => Sir, those references to Alchimadus, Beckett, Solzhenitsyn: all had something in common.
GOODSPEED => They were imprisoned for doing nothing wrong.  What's going on, sir?
MASON => one more thing: a shave and a haircut.  Hello Womack.
CPT.  GILER => What it's all about, sir: Willy Peter burns steel, burns titanium; it'll sure burn up your poison and everything else in the atmosphere.
GENERAL PETERSON => I need four F-16's equipped with air-to-ground missiles within...  .... twenty-six hours.
LT. FISK => Let me name some things that are more possible, General, with all due respect: winning the Lottery, climbing Mt. Everest barefoot, getting a parking space at Yankee Stadium, marrying Sharon Stone ...
CPT.  GILER => Can't do it, General.
GENERAL PETERSON => You can.  And you will.
CPT.  GILER => Get yer minds off Budweiser, baseball, and broads, fellahs - we're goin, ,round the clock!
CARLA =>   Hi! Bill and Carla ain't in! State your business!  Make it interesting!
GOODSPEED =>  Listen Carla: I'll explain later, but don't come to San Francisco.
GOODSPEED =>   I repeat, don't come to San Francisco.
CARLA => Like hell I'm not...
MASON =>  Who's Carla?  And why don't you want her to come to San Francisco?
GOODSPEED => You're on a need to know basis and you don't need to know.
MASON => You learn that line in Cub Scouts, Goodspeed?
MARSHAL CORD => Put 'em on.  You've got forty-five minutes.
MASON => You going to stand there and watch?
MARSHAL CORD => That's right.
MASON => well if it excites-you ...
MARSHAL CORD => Put the goddamn clothes on.
BARBER => I can't do a decent job with these.
BARBER => I'm an artist, not a barber.
MASON => Shall we do this outside?  In the sunshine?
BARBER => How would you like it sir?
MASON => whatever's in style.
BARBER => oh fabulous.  You look shabby.  Shall I snip and cut the shabbiness away?
MASON => Good.  Thank-you.
MASON => Yes of course.  My secretary will take care of you.-  See to the good man will you?
MASON => What say we bury the hatchet, Womack.
MASON => In your head.
-- MASON => on the balcony, clutching the other end of the nylon clothesline, staring at Goodspeed.
GOODSPEED => Jesus...  JESUS CHRIST....
MASON => - Drop the gun or I'll drop your boss.
F.B.I. AGENT => Holy shit, we got a jumper.
MASON => Whoops .... I'm feeling tired .... Whoops .... MASON lets Womack drop a foot. Womack SCREAMS! GOODSPEED drops his gun and grabs the clothesline.  MASON bolts from the balcony into the suitels library.
GOODSPEED => All units, this is Caretaker.  WE'VE GOT A SIGNAL SIX. Mason's in the elevator!  Let me know where he stops!
GOODSPEED => exits, looking at MASON getting into the HUMVEE. The Humvee explodes out of the hotel driveway.
GOODSPEED => That's him!
RADIO NEWSMAN => This just in: More than twenty highway patrolmen are involved in a highspeed chase on Van Ness Boulevard, north of Trocadero
MASON => Modern conveniences.  Cheers.  San Francisco. Jade Angelou.  That's A..n..g..e..l ....
JADE ANGELOU =>  Hello?
MASON => Is this Jade Angelou?
JADE ANGELOU =>  Yes.  Who is this?
MASON => John Mason.  Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
GOODSPEED => Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing? HE'S ON THE PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit. Gotta go.
face. => GOODSPEED Shit shit SHIT SHIT ...
GOODSPEED => It's not mine.
MOTORCYCLE KID => Way cool. 
GOODSPEED => Neither is this.
ISHERWOOD => Chem weapons.  Isherwood.
GOODSPEED =>  Marvin, ring up Wolfburg Federal Pen.  The inmate is Mason, John.
ISHERWOOD => Wolfburg, got it. Masconi, Magrane, Masters.  No MASON in Wolfburg, Bill, is this arelative of yours... ?
GOODSPEED => NOT NOW Isherwood.  Go to February 1976.  Who was transferred to Wolfburg from San Quentin that year?
ISHERWOOD => Two guys.  Joseph Wainwright, and a.... they don't have a name, just "inmate 9999?"
GOODSPEED => Hit nine nine nine nine.
ISHERWOOD => This is weird.  They got medical records, place of birth - Glasgow? but no name.  Wait a minute, there's a next of kin.  Jade Angelou of 32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.  Bill did you, like, fuck something up?  Bill?  Bill?
MASON => Jade.
MASON => Hello.  Yes.  It's me.
JADE => I uhm...  I'm not quite sure what to say. This is all a bit much
MASON => Let's uhm...  let's walk a ways.
JADE => So  how long have you been out?
MASON => A while.
JADE => A while.  And you didn't call?  You are free now, right?
MASON => I'm here with you, aren't I?
JADE => Why now?  I mean why today.
MASON => I was driving through San Francisco.  I decided it was time.
JADE => Well there's not a lot I know about you other than you escaped from San Quentin, had a four day affair with my mother, and I'm the result. You can imagine I'm pretty confused.
MASON => I tried to explain in my letters.
JADE => Ahh.  Your letters.  They weren't very easy to follow.
MASON => I see.  Bloody prison censors.
JADE => How about explaining now?
MASON => Maybe this isn't the best time...  Jade.  Here sitdown.
looks off => nervously.
MASON => All will be explained.  You must trust me on this. Someday very soon, after I get a few things settled, I will come back for you.  What I need to know is: do you want me in your life?
JADE => How can I answer that?  I don't know if we can.... after 19 years, just start like that.
MASON => We are the same blood.
JADE => But I don't know you.
MASON => where to begin.  My name is John Paul Mason.  I'm Scottish. I attended Dartmouth Naval College.  My favorite color is green.  I like books.  I like a good joke.  At one time I shot a pretty fair round of golf.  I'm in my 60's and I've been in jail half my life.  Maybe it's better I go.
JADE => No. You're doing okay.
JADE => You lied to me.
GOODSPEED =>  F.B.I. miss.  Your father is working with us.  He's helping us resolve a....  .... dangerous situation.
JADE => He is?
GOODSPEED => Yes madam.  We've got to go, John.
MASON => Jade - remember what I said.
GOODSPEED =>  No cuffs until we get to the cars,
MASON => You surprise me, Goodspeed.  Now I'm going to surprise myself: thank-you, you could have handled that differently.
GOODSPEED =>  You almost got me killed.  Twice.
MASON => Hows your jaw?
GOODSPEED => It hurts.
MASON => Pleased to meet you.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => Okay, one more time: down this second fork fifty-seven paces to a septic chamber.  Turn left at the water pump, then forty-two paces to the prison showers ...
MASON => No. Forty-two paces to the septic chamber.  Fifty-seven to the showers.
COMMANDER ANDERSON =>  That's not what you said three minutes ago.
MASON =>  It's not?
COMMANDER ANDERSON =>  Excuse me.  Womack.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => I ask for someone with knowledge of the island's tunnels. you give me a fuckin, convict who wants to play "twenty questions."
COMMANDER ANDERSON => Then he's keeping it to himself.  He's fucking with me and I don't have the time.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => Out of the question.  He'll endanger the mission - he'll endanger my men.  He's a security risk.  Who says he won't bolt as soon as we turn our backs on him?
MASON => You son-of-fucking-Satan.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => The goal is to take out the launchers and neutralize the V.X.chem rounds, Goodspeed.  Tell us what you know.
GOODSPEED => Well, the thermal imaging photos picked up the poison gas. Here.  The prison morgue.  It's probably being kept refrigerated. makes sense.  V.X. gas begins to lose its toxicity at higher temperatures.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => Have you ever actually seen one of these devices?
GOODSPEED => No sir, but I've studied them ....
COMMANDER  ANDERSON =>  That's great, Goodspeed.  You're in the Bureau, so you've had weapons training.
GOODSPEED => A little, sir.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => So you've never been in a combat situation.
GOODSPEED => No sir.  Should I begin the briefing on diffusing and detoxification sir?
COMMANDER ANDERSON => Won't be necessary.
GOODSPEED => Sir, these are very complicated devices...
COMMANDER ANDERSON => I know they are, Goodspeed.  That's why you're going with us.
GOODSPEED => Sir?
COMMANDER ANDERSON =>  Get him some gear.
MASON => Wait just a minute.  This little twat's going to deal with the poison?  He's gonna get us all fuckin' killed!
S.E.A.L. DANDO => Nice to meet you too.
SANCHEZ => You look like shit.
GOODSPEED => Thank you.
SANCHEZ => You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
GOODSPEED => I join the F.B.I. I ask for fieldwork.  They say, "Bill, you're too fucking smart for field work." Every year I put in for a transfer and every year I sit in that goddamn lab like the fucking Maytag repairman in the commercial.  Then the call finally comes, and it's a whole fuckin, city at stake?  Oh Jesus...
SANCHEZ => Chemical Weapons isn't a cakewalk, Goodspeed.
GOODSPEED => I've got some bad news and some really bad news sir.  Maybe the bad news isn't bad, maybe actually it's good ....
SANCHEZ => Spit it out.
GOODSPEED => My girlfriend's pregnant.
SANCHEZ =>  What's the really bad news.
SANCHEZ =>  Goodspeed, GODDAMN IT ...
SANCHEZ => Agent Cord, get over to the Pan Pacific Hotel and bring Goodspeed's girlfriend to this facility please!!
CAPTAIN DARROW =>  Seventeen hours left.  What the fuck is he doing?  How much time does it take to transfer money from one account
CAPTAIN FRYE => Just a matter of time, buddy.  The Pentagonlll cave and we'll be headin, south of the border a million dollars richer.
HUMMEL =>  Hummel.
GENERAL KRAMER => We're having some problems with the account transfer, Frank.
HUMMEL => Don't tell me your problems, tell me your solutions.
GENERAL KRAMER => We've spoken to the President. He's not too happy about this.
HUMMEL => Well he'd better give me a goddamn assurance ...
HAYDEN SINCLAIR => The only thing the President will give you is a fair trial after you're caught, General.
HUMMEL => That you, Sinclair?  What exactly do you do at the White House? Answer the presidential phone? Wash the presidential limousine? Are you his golf caddy, Sinclair?
HAYDEN SINCLAIR => Now you give me some coddamn respect, General ....
HUMMEL => You want respect, you child, you coffee server?  Let's talk about Dave Ridgeway.
GENERAL KRAMER => Who's Dave Ridgeway, Frank?
HUMMEL => A twenty-two year old marine tortured to death by a communist death squad in the El Salvadoran jungle.  His mother and young wife were told by the Pentagon that he went A.W.O.L. Let's talk about the respect he got.
LOUIS LINDSTROM => This is going nowhere Frank ....
HUMMEL => Then let me tell you what is: The most lethal poison gas known to man into San Franciscols business district.  You have twelve hours to deliver the money or be prepared to reap the whirlwind, gentlemen.
LOUIS LINDSTROM => What's the word from Mojave?
GENERAL KRAMER => General Petersen can give us no definite assurance on the Willy Peter capability.
LOUIS LINDSTROM => Greenlight the S.E.A.L. incursion.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => Listen up, men.  Mr. MASON here will run point for us.  Lieutenant Shepherd will be attached to your hip, Mason.  You breath, he breathes with you.  Understand?
COMMANDER ANDERSON => Shep, what's the status on the special operational gear for Mason.
S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD =>  one aluminum fork and one quart of motor oil in a squeeze tube.
GOODSPEED => Motor oil?
MASON => For cottonmouth.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => GOODSPEED here's our specialist.  We will cover him while he neutralizes the' chemical threat.  If he does his job we'll launch flares and hold our position 'till the cavalry comes.  Make no mistake about it, gentlemen, we are going in against an entrenched force led by one hot-shit field commander.  We are in the fight of our lives, I bullshit you not.  Any questions?  Let's move out.
MASON => After you, 'lace."
COMMANDER ANDERSON => Activate mini-cams.
NAVAL MEDIC => Atropine.  Any contact with the gas, use it.
GOODSPEED => Uhn uhn.  I hate needles.
SANCHEZ => Mini-cams operational.
CARLA => Would you please tell me what is going on?
AGENT CORD => Can't do that, malam.  Sorry.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => You know what you're doing?
MASON => Yes.  Little fancier than I'm used to.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => Prepare to deplore!
GOODSPEED => Wait a minute.  What if this thing crashes ...
MASON => Smile Goodspeed.  Live a little.  Life is short...  especially yours.
CAPTAIN FRYE =>  Something on radar, sir.  Two Hueys in standard formation, due east and approaching.
BAXTER => Decoy?
HUMMEL => Royce, Scarpetti, Gamble, Starling: get to the west end of the island on the double.  Think we have visitors.
ROYCE => You heard the man, let's move it.
escaped 33 => years earlier.
ROYCE => Looks all clear, sir.
BAXTER => Nothing.
HUMMEL => Tell 'em to stay out there.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => Thank-you very fucking much, Mr. Mason, you've led us to a room with no exit.
S.E.A.L. BOYER => Skipper, blow it or burn it?
COMMANDER ANDERSON => No time for the torch.  Explosives'll bring the fucking world down on us.  An idea, please, we're tight on time.
MASON => Wait for me to unlock the door.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => You do not look like Jesus Christ, Mr. Mason, so I'm having a hard time how you're going to accomplish that.
MASON =>  Under there.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => You are shitting me.  You catch one of those steam bursts and you're a corpse.
MASON => True.  I memorized their timing.
S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD => Uhh sir, you said never leave his side ...
COMMANDER ANDERSON => You're not required to follow, Lieutenant Shepherd. This man is going to die.
MASON =>  That's been said to me before ....
S.E.A.L. REIGERT => Who the fuck is this guy?  Houdini?
MASON => Welcome to the Rock.
S.E.A.L. DANDO => She's at least three inches thick sir.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => Shit.  Burn it.
MASON =>  Guys are worthless.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => Who is this guy... ?
COMMANDER ANDERSON => The shower room?  After you.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => Motion sensor.
ROYCE => Sir.  Anti-disturbance temblar tripped in the shower.  We got visitors.
COMMANDER ANDERSON =>  Stand fast. We'll secure the area.
SANCHEZ => What's that...what the hell is that?
GOODSPEED =>  What's going on?
S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD =>  Don't know.
HUMMEL =>  Drop your weapons.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => Anderson here, General Hummel. Commander.  Team Leader.
HUMMEL =>  Commander Anderson, if you have any concern for the lives of your men, you will order them to safety their weapons and place them on the deck at their feet-
SANCHEZ => Oh Christ this isn't happening.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => Sir, we know why you're out here.  God knows I agree with you sir, but like you sir, I swore to defend this country against all enemies.  Foreign, sir, and domestic.  General, we've spilled the same blood in the same mud.  You know goddamn well that I cannot give that order...
HUMMEL => Your unit is covered from an elevated position, Commander.  I'm not going to ask again.
HUMMEL => Don't do anything stupid, Commander. No one has to die here.
COMMANDER ANDERSON => You men following the General: You are United States Marines and under oath you forgotten that?  We all have shipmates we remember - some of 'em were shit on and spit on by the Pentagon - that doesn't give you the right to mutiny.
HUMMEL => That's a nice speech, Commander.  I heard plenty like it in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill.  They all added up to zero.  Pretty words aren't gonna get you out of this, Commander.  Now abort this mission. Goddamn it, abort.
S.E.A.L. BOYER => It's us or them, Reigert, fuck they're gonna waste us ...
S.E.A.L. REIGERT => Get a grip on yourself ....
GOODSPEED => Don' t do it.
S.E.A.L. SHEPHERD => Let go of me.
HUMMEL => HOLD YOUR FIRE HOLD YOUR FIRE ....
SANCHEZ => It's over.
F.B.I. TECHNICIAN => We've still got movement.  Numbers eleven and twelve. That's GOODSPEED and.... Mason.
GOODSPEED => We're never gettin off this island.
GOODSPEED =>  .... god Jesus we're gonna die
SANCHEZ => You told me I am on a "need to know" basis.  Well goddamn it, I need to know.  Who the fuck is John Mason.  Start talking, Director, or I swear I will go to the press.
SANCHEZ => What about the daughter? why didn't Hoover use her as leverage?
SANCHEZ => My god, you're not saying ...
GOODSPEED => Don't shoot me. MASON was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
MASON => For christ's sake. MASON trudges down the tu=el.  Goodspeed follows him.
GOODSPEED => Wait.  Where're you going?
MASON => Off this island.  You mind?
GOODSPEED => Yes I mind.  I mind very much.
SANCHEZ =>   Goodspeed, Goodspeed, come in.
MASON => You've got a phone call.
GOODSPEED => It's me sir.
SANCHEZ =>  What is happening?  Where's Mason?
GOODSPEED => He says he's leaving the island sir.
SANCHEZ => Don't let him do that.
GOODSPEED => He's got a gun, sir.
SANCHEZ => What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
HUMMEL => I never wanted this.  Jesus christ.
BAXTER => We knew it might happen, Frank.
CAPTAIN DARROW => Maybe now they'll pay up.
CAPTAIN HENDRIX => Maybe now they won't.
CAPTAIN DARROW => Then maybe we'll execute a few hostages.
S.E.A.L. DANDO => You'll go to hell for this General.
CAPTAIN DARROW =>  Put a bullet in him.
CAPTAIN FRYE => You heard him.  End it.
HUMMEL => CAPTAIN, HOLSTER THAT SIDEARM.
CAPTAIN DARROW =>  Yes sir.
ROYCE => He's dead anyway sir.
HUMMEL =>   You have a made a terrible mistake and more of our brothers have died in vain.  Let's not repeat this.
SGT.  CRISP => General!  This man's weapons and tac radio are missing!
HUMMEL => Rodent problem, people.  Let's flush the pipes.
GOODSPEED => would you stop.  Just stop.  I don't know whatyou did or why you were sent to jail, but there are a million people across that bay who might die...  Fuck this. Stop.  Freeze.
CAPTAIN HENDRIX =>  Rodents located.
GOODSPEED => F.B.I.     Stop right there.  I really mean it.
MASON =>  If you really mean it, take the safety off.
SANCHEZ =>   Goodspeed.  Goodspeed, come in.  Have you resolved this?
GOODSPEED => Now he has all the guns, sir. .  You've got to help me.  What do you want me to do, beg?
MASON => Save your breath and your dignity, if you have any.  I am leaving. I am getting my daughter and getting the hell out of here.
MASON => Hold your breath.
MASON => Come on.  And keep your mouth shut.
GOODSPEED => Now what?
MASON => Came out right through there. 'Course I've gained a few since ...
MASON => Across that, then 50 yards to the morgue.  You said that's where the fucking poison is, Goodspeed.
GOODSPEED => I don't get it.  You're going to help me?
MASON => No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
GOODSPEED => You don't have to get all bent out of shape.
MASON => What's bent out of shape, idiot, is the tunnel I was going through to freedom five minutes ago.
GOODSPEED => All right, all right.  Don't call me idiot, okay?
MASON => Stop.  There.  And there.
MASON => Cottonmouth snakes.  They breath through their skin.  Oil clogs it.  They hate the stuff.
MASON => sprays the motor oil across the pool.  The snakes scatter.  The pool's now coated with an OIL SLICK.  MASON wades in.  Goodspeed follows.
GOODSPEED => Something's a little off here: I'm the F.B.I. Agent, you're the convict, and you have all the guns.
GOODSPEED => The morgue?
MASON => Never hesitate.
GOODSPEED => You didn't learn that in prison.
MASON => No, and I used to be a lot quicker.
GOODSPEED => I've got some questions for you but they can wait.
GOODSPEED => Careful.  The second you don't respect this, it kills you.
GOODSPEED => I need a hand here.  Mason.  Now.
GOODSPEED => hands the poison pearl strand to Mason.  MASON  holds it like a string of wind chimes.
MASON => What...  exactly does this do to you?
GOODSPEED => Any epidermal exposure or inhalation and you'll know: A twinge at the small of your back as the poison seizes the nervous system.  Then loss of muscular function. Then you spit your guts out, it looks like a tub of spaghettils spilled on the floor, then your skin turns black...
MASON => Sounds like my first marriage.
GOODSPEED =>  Pier 39 come in.
SANCHEZ =>   Goodspeed?  Where the hell have you been. Talk to me.
GOODSPEED => We're in the morgue.  I'm removing the rocket's guidance system chips.  Without em the rocketslll fly about 500 feet and splash down like a wounded duck.
GOODSPEED => moves on to the third and fourth chem rounds. Suddenly there's a BEEP. GOODSPEED and MASON whirl.  Pvt. Gamble's WALKIE TALKIE is talking to them:
HUMMEL =>  Gamble, Starling.  Come in.
HUMMEL =>  Privates Gamble and Starling, come in.
HUMMEL => The morgue. Hummel and Baxter exit quickly.
MASON => C'mon c'mon....  faster ....
MASON => I thought you were cool under pressure.
GOODSPEED => Shut up; you're making me nervous.
MASON => They'll be on us in twenty seconds.
GOODSPEED => Wait a minute.  Fuck.  Hummel stole fifteen chem rounds. There's only twelve here.  Here.  Quickly.  Do these last four.
HUMMEL => Hendrix!  Take Royce and Scarpetti!
BAXTER => Gamble and Starling are dead.
CAPTAIN HENDRIX => FOLLOW ON FOOT!
MASON => BRAKE! ! !
GOODSPEED => Mason!
GOODSPEED => Wait.
GOODSPEED => Pretty easy killing an unconscious man. How about trying me? Punk.  What're you waiting for?  Limp dick.
ROYCE => I am going to fuck you up something fierce.  You rolled the wrong number, shithead.  You crapped out.
GOODSPEED => I rolled snake-eyes.  Shithead.
MASON => Limp dick?
GOODSPEED => It's all I could think of.
MASON => I think I've got arthritis.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR => The President arrives in three hours.  His directive is to string Hummel along until the airstrike is operational.
LOUIS LINDSTROM => What's the word from Mojave, General?
GENERAL KRAMER =>  They're going as fast as they can.
LT. FISK => We're fucked, cap'n.
CPT.  GILER => Are we fucked with a pencil or are we fucked with a baseball bat.
LT. FISK => We're fucked with a telephone pole.  we can arm em with Willy Peter, no problem, but negatory pn smart bomb capability.
CPT.  GILER => What are you saying?
LT. FISK => The pilots are gonna have to drop em manually.  We're talkin, retro, baby.  We're talkin' World War II.
HUMMEL =>   Attention Navy Seals, attention.
GOODSPEED => He thinks we're Seals.
HUMMEL =>   Congratulations.  You've taken some things of mine.  I can't convince you to return them so I'll put on someone who can.
MALE VOICE =>   Hell...  hello.
HUMMEL => Tell them your name and age.
LARRY HENDERSON => My n...name is L... larry Henderson.  I'm forty-eight.
HUMMEL => Good Mr. Henderson, continue ...
LARRY HENDERSON => I don't know who you are, but p please, there's a gun
HUMMEL =>   Convinced?  Mr. Henderson hopes so. You have two minutes.
GOODSPEED => I'll go.
MASON => Wrong.
GOODSPEED => What, vou?
MASON => I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
GOODSPEED => Good point.  Okay here, take 'em.
GOODSPEED => What are you doing?
MASON => Now they only have three rockets left.
GOODSPEED => What about Mr. Henderson?
MASON => Hummel's a soldier, not a murderer.
GOODSPEED => Wait.
MASON =>  Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
GOODSPEED => I... I don't know if I can do this.
MASON => There's only one way to find out.  I'll try to give you time.  And Goodspeed....  Don't be an idiot. Put that on.
GOODSPEED => Well thank-you, thank-you very much.
CAPTAIN DARROW => Gotta be kidding me.  They send an old man.
HUMMEL => I thought I'd been in the service a long time.  Name and rank, sailor.
MASON => John Paul Mason.  Royal Navy.  Commander.
HUMMEL => You're a long way from England, Commander Mason.
MASON => I feel strangely at home.
HUMMEL => How's that?
MASON => You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
HUMMEL => Do you have some unique knowledge of this prison facility, Commander Mason?
MASON => Quite unique.
HUMMEL => How's that?
MASON => I was a guest here.
GOODSPEED =>  Freeze.  Drop the weapon and turn around. Slowly.
HUMMEL => Well you're some kind of joker, Mason.  Maybe you're a lunatic. Are you of sound mind, Mason?
MASON => I'm not threatening the lives of a million innocent people.  You are.
HUMMEL => Give me the guidance chips.
MASON => I threw them in the bay.
HUMMEL => That was stupid of you.
MASON =>  Would you have shot him7
HUMMEL => You seem like a bright man, Commander. Bright men understand necessity.
MASON => Bright men also obey the law. "Wherever law ends, terror begins." John Locke.
HUMMEL => "Where there is no law, there is no transgression." The Bible. Romans, Chapter 4, Verse 15.
MASON => Article 7, American Constitution?  "Treason against the United States shall consist of... 11
HUMMEL => The American Constitution was written by traitors, Commander. Traitors against a government founded on injustice and tyranny and stupidity.  I see little difference in my motivation.
HUMMEL => Do you, Commander Mason?
HUMMEL => Frye, Crisp, go!
GOODSPEED wildly => discharges his gun until CLICK, the clip is spent.  Cox and McCoy step through the doorway.
MCCOY => Swallow that and I swear on my Aunt Myrtle's grave I'll cut your belly open and pull it out.
GOODSPEED => Mason.  Mason?
MASON =>  It's about time.
GOODSPEED => Where are you?
MASON => Above you.  Literally and figuratively.
MASON => is BRAIDING THE STRIPS into a long rope.  The rope is quite finely constructed.  Mason's been at this several hours.
GOODSPEED => This is tiny.
MASON => You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your anatomy ....
GOODSPEED => The cell, Mason.
MASON => Five feet by seven.  Try living in one for a year.  What happened?
GOODSPEED => I only got one chem round.  There are two left.  I fucked up.
MASON =>  Surprise, surprise.
GOODSPEED => I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
MASON => An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
GOODSPEED => What is your beef with the Bureau, anyway Clmon.  Tell me.
MASON => Let's say our countries had a little dispute.  They both knowingly shafted me.
GOODSPEED => How?
MASON => Familiar with the name Hoover, Goodspeed?  I don't mean a vacuum cleaner ...
GENERAL PETERSON => Captain Giler?
CPT.  GILER => We jerry-rigged a release lever.  You'll find it on the left side of the cockpit.  It's got two positions: safety and release.  Throw it on release, the bomb drops in five seconds.  Change your mind, throw it back on safety.  Any questions?
GOODSPEED => Jesus.  Why didn't you just tell Hoover and the bureau where the microfilm was?  Make a trade?
MASON => Some trade.  They'd get the microfilm and I'd get a bullet in the head.
GOODSPEED => I see your point.  Something's been on my mind.  About your escape.
MASON => What?
GOODSPEED => You went down the shower drain, through the tunnels to the power plant, under the steam engine and out through the intake pipe - that much I've got ' But... howld you get out of your cell?
GOODSPEED =>  I only ask because, in our current situation, it might be useful information ...
MASON => Trade secret, Billy, I'll tell you this:    it was easier than getting in.
MASON => fiercely yanks the rope toward him.  The heavy rolling caster jerks from the floor.  The CASTER, pulling the rope, flies past Mason's cell --
MASON => tugs the rope taut like he's just snagged a fish. Then he pulls slowly and delicately.
MASON => smiles.
GOODSPEED => Hey!  Hey what's happening?  Mason.  Mason?
MASON => You're on your own, kid.  Your gear's over there.
GOODSPEED => Shit....
GOODSPEED => grabs his guns and gear and follows after Mason. 225  EXT.  ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - MORNING Hummel sits behind the desk.  Baxter, Frye, Darrow, Hendrix in front of him. Silence.  Hummel stares at his phone.  The tension is palpable.
HUMMEL => Time.
BAXTER =>  Fifteen minutes Frank.
CAPTAIN FRYE => We have two operational rockets left, General.  One on the lower lighthouse, one on the rooftop, ready for fire. General.
HUMMEL => I heard you Captain.
CAPTAIN DARROW => Prepare for launch General?  General?
HUMMEL => Not yet.
CAPTAIN FRYE => General Hummel, noon is approaching.
HUMMEL => I'm aware of the time, Captain.
LOUIS LINDSTROM => When was the last communication from our men on Alcatraz?
GENERAL KRAMER => Seven hours ago.
GENERAL KRAMER => Get me the President.
GOODSPEED => Mason.  John.  What happened - the injustice done to you - doesn't mean you can walk away from this.  A million people across that Bay will die.
MASON => Only one of them I care about.
GOODSPEED => You were once a different man.
MASON => You don't know what kind of man I was.
GOODSPEED => You were a civil servant.  Sworn to do your duty.  Just like me.
CAPTAIN DARROW => Eleven fifty-seven, General.  Three minutes to go.
HUMMEL => They're going to call.
CAPTAIN FRYE => They are not going to call General.
HUMMEL => I... I don't understand this.
CAPTAIN DARROW => I understand it.  They're calling our bluff.  We have two operational rockets left.  We have to stick one of those rockets in their ear, General.
HUMMEL => Atom?
BAXTER => I'...I don't know Frank.
HUMMEL => Seventy thousand peqple...  I didn't... i didn't ever...
CAPTAIN FRYE => You didn't ever what?  You didn't ever what, General?  General, forty-eight hours ago I was in a cushy job at Pendleton.  As of this moment I am subject to prosecution for treason and murder.  Do you know what that means.  It means the electric chair.  For all of us.
BAXTER => He's right Frank.  Authorize the launch or it's over.
CAPTAIN DARROW => Authorize the launch, General.
GOODSPEED => You'll never make it.
MASON => I once swam the English Channel, but you're entitled to your,opinion.
GOODSPEED => Fine.  I'll fuckin, do it myself.
HUMMEL =>   Launch coordinates 675 dash 439.
CAPTAIN FRYE => Aye aye General: coordinates 675 dash Awaiting launch command.
CAPTAIN FRYE =>    General, your command.
HUMMEL =>  Fire.
MASON =>  My god. MASON looks up. GOODSPEED stands above on the embankment.
GOODSPEED => That change things?
SANCHEZ => East.  But that's... Oakland.  My god.  The football game.
MASON => comes back up the embankment.  Faces Goodspeed-with grim resolve:
GOODSPEED => Partners?
MASON => Partners.
CIWTER FISHERMAN => What the hell.... ?
CAPTAIN FRYE => I don't believe it.  He pulled the plug.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR => They need a decision Mr. President.
PRESIDENT => These past few hours have been the longest, darkest of my life.  This is when you wish the buck did not stop here.  A balance between two tragedies. On one hand the fate of a million civilians. On the other, Frank Hummel.  That we have ignored or abandoned or marginalized a great soldier like Frank Hummel and that American boys have paid the price of that neglect in blood, is equally real, and equally tragic.
HAYDEN SINCLAIR => The glass is half full not half empty, sir.  No civilian casualties so far.
PRESIDENT => I don't believe in half full or half empty, Sinclair.  There are chemical weapons and there are civilians.  And there are men on Alcatraz wholve proved they're willing to use the one on the other. We are at war with terror.  Fighting a war means casualties. This is the worst call I've ever had to make.  Air strike approved.
CAPTAIN FRYE => You're gutless.  I knew it.
CAPTAIN DARROW => The problem is now thev know it.
HUMMEL => Careful son.  I'd maintain discipline if I were you.
and => Goodspeed's reactions.
CAPTAIN DARROW => I'm relieving you of your command General.  Captain Frye?
CAPTAIN FRYE => I'm in.
CAPTAIN DARROW => Major?
HUMMEL => Tom?
BAXTER => It's over Frank.  I'm in.
HUMMEL => Tom, I warn you.
BAXTER => Stand down, General.
HUMMEL => I'm giving you a direct order.
BAXTER =>  I'm not accepting it.
MASON => FIRES through the slit, killing Baxter as --
GOODSPEED => grabs the semi-consious Hummel and drags him down the corridor-.
HUMMEL => My god what have I done ...
GOODSPEED => It's not too late, General.  Tell me where the last chem round is.
HUMMEL =>  Lower lighthouse ...
MASON => Do your job, Billy. - I'll try to hold ,em off.
MASON => blasts away at Frye and Darrow, allowing GOODSPEED to sprint for the exit toward the lower lighthouse.
GOODSPEED => Don't ...
GOODSPEED => shoots Crisp.  Crisp falls dead. A255 INT.  INFIRMARY - CORRIDOR - DAY MASON advances toward the command center's door. Suddenly the HEAVY STEEL DOOR creaks open and --
MASON => dives away as the satchel DETONATES, imploding the corridor walls, collapsing the,ceiling. mason's engulfed in two tons of-plaster and crumbled cinder block.
CAPTAIN FRYE => Crisp, Darrow, come in... (thinks; clicks walkie talkie to new channel) Cox, McCoy, get your asses up here!
CAPTAIN DARROW => Give that to me.
GOODSPEED => You shoot me, I'll drop this and we're both dead.  One of these pearlslll kill everything within 200 feet.  You know how this shit works?
CAPTAIN DARROW => You know how this shit works?
GOODSPEED => You know the Elton John son, "Rocket Man"?
CAPTAIN DARROW => I hate it.
GOODSPEED => Well it happens to be my favorite fuckin, song!
GOODSPEED => emerges on the roof.  Sets down the chem round.  Pulls out the POISON PEARL STRANDS, his hand shaking.  With the other hand, he unclips the ROCKET GUIDANCE CHIP.
CAPTAIN FRYE => Give me the guidance chip.
looks down => at him.
MASON => Snakes hate the stuff.
lunges from => behind the machinery, jamming his fingers into Fryels mouth and ramming home the POISON PEARL.
CAPTAIN FRYE => You're comin, with me.
SANCHEZ => May god have mercy gn their souls.
CARLA =>  You can't do this, you can't let this happen.
GOODSPEED => exits and kneels, reaching for HIS OTHER PANTLEG.  PUllS out his GREEN FLARES.  He cracks the flares and fires them up.
F.B.I. TECHNICIAN => Ten seconds to the drop zone.  And now counting eight, seven, six ...
F.B.I. TECHNICIAN => Green smoke!  It's...   GOODSPEED!!
SANCHEZ => Abort.  Abort immediately.
GOODSPEED =>  Pier 39 come in.  Pier 39  ...  My god he's alive.
GOODSPEED =>  Every one of em sir.
GOODSPEED =>  Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
SANCHEZ => Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
GOODSPEED => Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon contract you signed?
MASON => Womack ripped it up, right?
GOODSPEED => You knew?  All this time?
MASON => I'm not a fool, Billy.
GOODSPEED => All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.
MASON => Goodspeed.  You know the etymology of your name?
GOODSPEED => God's speed.
MASON => Yes.  To wish someone a prosperous jouey.
MASON => And if you turn around I'll tell you a secret.
MASON =>  St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew. Right leg.  Hollow.
GOODSPEED => What's that?  Mason?
SANCHEZ => You surprised me, kid.  Never thought you could do it.
GOODSPEED => Neither did I sir.
GOODSPEED => Vaporized, sir.  Blown out to sea.
GOODSPEED => He saved my life, sir. Is SANCHEZ  going to accept this? .
SANCHEZ => Yes  Poor son-of-a-bitch.
F.B.I. AGENT => Sir, the White House calling.  It's the President.
F.B.I. AGENT => Uhm, sir, actually it's for Goodspeed.
GOODSPEED => Bill Goodspeed, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT =>  I am in your debt, Goodspeed, the country is in your debt.  You're a hero, son.
GOODSPEED => Thank you, Mr. President.  The man you should be thanking is John Mason.
PRESIDENT =>  So I've been informed. Would you put the F.B.I. Director on please?
GOODSPEED => Director Womack.
PRESIDENT =>  I don't want your explanation, Womack. I want your resignation.
CARLA => Would you please tell me what this is all about... ?
GOODSPEED => You want to know who really killed President Kennedy, honey...?
