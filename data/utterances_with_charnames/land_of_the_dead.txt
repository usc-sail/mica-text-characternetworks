THIRD NEWSCASTER => Every dead body that is not exterminated becomes one of them. It gets up and kills. The people it kills get up and kill. They kill for one reason. They kill for food. CLICK!
THIRD NEWSCASTER => If this situation is allowed to continue, there will be nothing left. Nothing. CLICK!
MIKE => They're trying to be us. RILEY They used to be us.
RILEY => They're learning how to be us again. RILEY DENBO watches the town through binoculars. 32, made rugged by realities, he has a heart beneath his tough eagerness and passion of someone young and unseasoned.
MIKE => o way. Some germ or some devil got them things up and walkin'. But there's a big difference between them and us. They're dead!
RILEY => Isn't that what we're doing, son? Pretending to be alive?
5                                                                5 => THE SOUND OF GROANING WOOD as THREE heavily-armed GUERILLAS push a large CRATE over a PRECIPICE into a deep GARBAGE PIT below. FIVE SIMILAR CRATES lie amid the rubble. Insects BUZZ. RATS crawl. HUMAN SKELETONS, most HEADLESS, lie everywhere, no flesh left on their bones. Those with heads show various wounds to their skulls. Except for one, which... ...suddenly, startlingly MOVES! Its bony arm reaches up from the bottom of the pit toward...
CHOLO => Poor bastard. WFFFFT! Cholo shoots the skeleton. His arrow goes completely through the WHITE SKULL.
6                                                                  6 => The doors of a beat-up WHITE MOVING VAN open. Cholo reaches in, throwing back an oilcloth that covers ANOTHER CRATE. GUERILLA Whole lotta trash this week. CHOLO That's life, brother. A whole lotta trash.

MIKE => Dunno. It's my first trip. Never had to use `em before.
RILEY => Great. I'm out here with a guy who can't shoot. Let's go.
IKE => Jesus. You can't shoot, neither!
CHARLIE => Tcha doin', Riley?
RILEY => Havin' a bad dream.
CHARLIE => I have bad dreams. Hell, yes. Just look at me, you can tell that I have terrible dreams.
RILEY => The town is full of walkers.
CHARLIE => Every town is full of walkers.
RILEY => These aren't just walking. They're like...regular folks.
CHARLIE => But they're dumb, Riley. Hell, dead folks is near as dumb as me!
RILEY => You learned how to make yourself useful. That's what they're doing. WOMAN'S VOICE They dumped the trash. Cholo's on his way.
MIKE => What happened to him? Pretty Boy turns, poking her finger through a BULLET HOLE encrusted with year-old BLOOD in the chest of her jacket. PRETTY BOY I kept his jacket. For good luck. MIKE Luck? RILEY Put some flowers in the graveyard. Pretty Boy reaches out and flips a toggle switch on the control panel. THOOMB! THOOMB! DEEP CONCUSSIVE SOUNDS can be felt as much as heard as...
11                                                            11 => ...RILEY, CHARLIE, and MIKE step out of A VEHICLE the size of a city bus. The words DEAD RECKONING are painted on its side. This is no bus. It's a war wagon, built of SCAVENGED PARTS with a RIVETED STEEL SKIN. GATTLING GUNS protrude from a MEAN-LOOKING SNOUT. A ROOF TURRET supports two FOURTEEN INCH-CANNONS. Rotating lights SHINE in all directions, piercing the night. THOOMB! THOOMB! THOOMB! That sound again. MORTAR TUBES on the vehicle's roof are launching FIREWORKS that BURST in the sky. CHARLIE `Flowers in the graveyard'. Why do you call `em that, Riley? I don't get it. These here flowers ain't the kind you lay down on the ground. These here are sky flowers. Way up in Heaven.
ILEY => I love ya, Charlie. Know why? Cuzz you still believe in heaven.
HOLO => You guys scope out the town?
RILEY => Looks like nobody's hit it before.
HOLO => Ready?

ILEY => We go in, do our job, and get out, all of us alive, okay? I don't want any fuck-ups on my last day out here.
HOLO => My last day, too.
CHARLIE => What'd he do, hit the lottery or somethin'?
RILEY => Somethin'.  Somethin'.
MIKE => Do those things really work? RILEY Yup.  Stenches can't take their eyes off `em.
12                                                               12 => DEAD THINGS stand completely frozen in the middle of main street, like statues, mesmerized by the FIREWORKS. Only one figure is moving. BIG DADDY. He weaves between his brothers and sisters, urgently waving his one good hand, like Frankenstein's monster, as if to say "Bad! Bad!" He has learned that fireworks bring danger.
13                                                            13 => THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: RILEY recognizes BIG DADDY from the gas station. He also recognizes the Thing's anguish as...

IKE => I thought it was gonna be a battle. This is a fucking massacre.
Kid, these => are the toughest guys in the `hood. You can't keep `em from wantin' to get some chuckles.
CHOLO => Hey, not me, Boss. You told me not to have any fun, I'm not having any fun at all.  Come with me, kid. I'll show you the ropes. Mike climbs out and gets on the back of Cholo's motorcycle.
RILEY => Where you goin'?
CHOLO => To get supplies. Essential supplies. That's job our job, ain't it?
16                                                               16 => THE WHITE MOVING VAN pulls up to a supermarket. THE DEAD THINGS in the parking lot, gazing at the FIREWORKS, barely notice the vehicle. MARKSMEN keep the lot covered as GUERILLAS carry CASES OF CANNED GOODS out of the supermarket and into the van. The team has this down to a science. ILEY'S VOICE comes over one Guerilla's hand-held radio.
RILEY => How's the food?
GUERILLA #1 => Lousy, but there's lots of it.
18                                                               18 => PRETTY BOY drives. RILEY stands beside her.

ANCHOR => Harry, jump on!
21                                                            21 => PRETTY BOY turns a corner. Out the windshield, RILEY sees...
RILEY => What the fuck?
23                                                            23 => CHOLO SCREECHES to a stop at a LIQUOR STORE with MIKE and FOXY. All dismount and start toward the entrance. They stop as DEAD RECKONING pulls up and RILEY and CHARLIE climb out. CHARLIE Nothin' in there but booze. Booze ain't essential. FOXY A jug of good Kentucky goes for fifteen hundred back in town.
RILEY => I'm not risking anybody's ass just so you can pick up some side money.
CHOLO => Not askin' you to.
ILEY => Mike! Wait! But Mike has followed the others inside.
4                                                               24 => CHOLO unstraps his crossbow and leads the way cautiously into the dark space. Every subtle SOUND in the SILENCE puts MIKE more on edge. His hand tenses on his gun as SHADOWS loom in front of him. Shadows that could be zombies, but are not. Behind the dusty glass doors of a once-refrigerated wall- unit, Cholo sees a CASE OF DOM PERIGNON. He goes to the
MIKE => Nice shootin'. CHARLIE Good shootin'. Ain't no such thing as nice shootin'.
RILEY => Close one. CHOLO I'm still here, ain't I? Everyone relaxes. Cholo picks up the case of Dom. The others head toward the front of the store. TILT DOWN TO THE FLOOR as their feet move past. In the gloom behind stacks of cartons... ...A DEAD HAND appears. Reaching.
CHOLO => Shit! Look out, kid! The hand grabs Mike around the ankle! Mike turns, raising his gun. Too late. A DEAD UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, the skin on half its face STRIPPED DOWN TO BONE, RIPS A HOLE IN HIS LEG with its teeth! ike SCREAMS, staggers into a wall, and drops to a seated position on the floor. Riley and Charlie spin around at the
HOLO => Fuckin' rookies.
ILEY => It's alright, son. You're gonna be alright.
MIKE => No. I'm dead. You get bit by one f those things and you become what they are.
25                                                            25 => THE WHITE MOVING VAN, THE T-BIRD, AND THE JEEP roll out of town in a convoy. Trailing them, THREE SADISTIC GUERILLAS on MOTORCYCLES ROAR past, firing... ...a HAIL OF BULLETS at A DEAD FAMILY on the sidewalk. The MOTHER FALLS. Not shot. It has been GRABBED and SHOVED down to the ground by... ...BIG DADDY! Who GRABS the little GIRL next, thrusting her roughly behind the protection of a wrecked car. The FATHER is last. Big Daddy grabs it from behind, by its hair, just as... ...ROUNDS from an UZI DRILL A DOTTED-LINE across the Father's neck. Big Daddy is unhurt, but spattered with BLOOD. Not red, greenish-black. The blood of the dead. here's a RIPPING SOUND as the Father's NECK is PULLED APART by the weight of its limp body. The body DROPS to the street.
26                                                               26 => DEAD RECKONING, emitting tendrils of HOT STEAM from twenty steel nostrils, stands parked in a corner of a fenced-in outdoor yard.  A SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the darkness as GUERILLAS unload the supplies they took from Uniontown and carry them toward... ...a set of RUSTY STEEL DOORS, above which is a FADED SIGN that reads "SUBWAY ". In the bustle of activity, HARRY, the biker who was attacked in town, perspires as he helps unload. He looks ill. RILEY walks past, handing out bottles of beer to the men. RILEY
27                                                               27 => A mile-long subway tunnel extends into BLACKNESS. A wide PLATFORM runs the length of the tracks, at the head of which A DERELICT TRAIN is parked. A CARGO CARRIER pulls out, driving along the platform, its flatbed piled with supplies, while ANOTHER CARRIER is being loaded with boxes of food, pharmaceuticals, ammunition, and... TWO BODY BAGS.
CHARLIE => Shit happens, Riley. RILEY Only if you let it.
ANNOUNCER => Protected on three sides by mighty rivers, the city stands as a monument
ANNOUNCER => Luxury living in the grand old style. Dine at one of three restaurants. Look for that perfect gift in our fabulous shopping mall.
GUERILLA => They make it sound nice. CHOLO It is nice. Holding his case of Dom Perignon and his box of Cohibas, CHOLO looks with FOXY at a monitor mounted to a white-tiled subway station wall. Down the tunnel behind them, the other GUERILLAS unload supplies from CARGO CARRIERS parked on the platform. A sign reads, "GOLDEN TRIANGLE/FIDDLER'S GREEN".
RILEY => Cholo. Foxy moves away, leaving Riley and Cholo alone. RILEY Two people dead. That kid, Mike. He should be here with us right now.
HOLO => I didn't kill him. He got bit and he killed himself. Same thing I woulda done. And you!
RILEY => The fuck are you turning into, man? CHOLO e take money to do nasty shit. Shit that nobody else is dumb enough to do. We go in knowing the risks. The kid did too. His number came up, that's all.
RILEY => We take the risk to bring in things people need. Not to make a few extra bucks selling liquor. You used to know that. CHOLO Everybody makes their own way. verybody makes their own ucking way!
CHOLO => y daddy...he picked fruit, penny- a-piece. He never went for anything, so he never had anything. I'm gonna have a place, Riley. My own place! And now I got enough money to buy my way in.
NNOUNCER => Isn't it time? Isn't it your time? For Fiddler's Green.
ILEY => You're dreaming, Cholo. They'd never let me in. They'll never let you in. We're the wrong kind.
ANNOUNCER => Bask in the security of a city protected not only by its natural boundaries, but by hand-picked members of its own private militia.
30                                                               30 => In live action, not on the   monitor, WEARY TROOPS, sloppily uniformed, guard four rows   of electrified, barbed-wire FENCING. DEAD THINGS cluster by the   DOZENS outside the barricades. CORPSES hang all along the   stretch, suspended on the barbs.

MILITARY MAN => Take its fuckin' face off.
1                                                               31 => CHOLO approaches a CHECKPOINT manned by TWO SECURITY GUARDS. Setting down the champagne and Cohibas, he unstraps his weapons and hands them over. CHOLO DeMora. Supply unit SECURITY GUARD What's in them boxes? CHOLO Essential supplies. For the man upstairs.
2                                                               32 => FIDDLER'S GREEN, a heavily protected HIGH-RISE in the center of the city, dominates the skyline. It's where the Fat Cats live, protected from urban decay. The building is surrounded by unoccupied high-rises that define "the golden triangle", a clean section in the center of the city. No ugliness in view.
You're gonna => need this.
RILEY => Nope. When I said quittin' time, I meant quittin'
33                                                               33 => RILEY and CHARLIE walk down a street into the city's "ghetto" zone, which is lined with taverns, gambling clubs, strip joints, like a boom town from Alaskan gold-rush days. BUYERS and SELLERS lurk in the shadows, copulating, dealing drugs.
CHARLIE => Wanna get a drink, Riley? Just ook at me, you can tell I could use a drink.
RILEY => Later. Gotta see a man about a car.
MULLIGAN => Irish accent) How long are you gonna let him push you around? If there was enough of us...if you all would join up with us...we could pull him down off his throne! Some of the people in the audience nervously shift their eyes to the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE ten blocks away. RILEY You can't fix a place like this, Mulligan. You just have to get out
RILEY => Everyone's stoppable. We hear the sound of a boy coughing. Mulligan's son BRIAN stands behind him, looking feverish. MULLIGAN You alright, son? BRIAN I'm fine, dad. As Riley starts past, he stops, pulls something from his pocket, and presses it into Mulligan's palm. RILEY Antibiotics. For your boy. Mulligan looks down with gratitude at a bottle his hand. When he looks up again, Riley is gone.
34                                                            34 => Turning a corner, RILEY and CHARLIE stop in front of a rundown GARAGE with a tarp hanging down instead of a door. Riley pulls it aside and looks in. A HOBO lies asleep on a grease-stained floor, curled under some old newspapers.
RILEY => Where's the car?
OBO => What car?
RILEY => My new car. I paid for it. I was here yesterday. There were two guys getting it ready for me.
OBO => There was nobody here this morning.
RILEY => Sonofabitch!
CHARLIE => What happened, Riley. Didja get fucked?
RILEY => Come on.
KNIPP => Oh, man. Mister K. sure gonna be upset about this. Cholo drops his boxes and moves down the corridor. KNIPP I called Security. They should be here... Cholo reaches the door to PENTHOUSE NUMBER TWO. It's locked. ANOTHER SCREAM from inside. He FLINGS himself at the door. The LATCH SPLINTERS out of the frame. The door BURSTS open...
6                                                            36 => ...and CHOLO enters a dark foyer. The only light comes from another room somewhere inside. A soft, rhythmic SQUEAK, like
WOMAN => My Johnny, he killed himself, he killed himself. My Johnny! My Johnny! Cholo shakes her, hard. CHOLO Keep it together, lady. Behind them, in the kitchen, unseen, a dazed YOUNG MAN, walks up to the hanging corpse. He rights the toppled chair and steps on it, lifting a paring to knife cut through the noose.
YOUNG MAN => Dad. Oh, Dad. WOMAN Se-Security. Are you Security?
CHOLO => No, I...
WOMAN => Then, for God's sake, who ARE YOU?!
CHOLO => Shut up! I gotta hear. Where'd he go? Where'd the other guy go? Silence. Cholo pulls the poker out of the Young Man's head. SHUFFLING sounds. He follows them to the other end of the kitchen, probing the darkness with his matchlight. The sounds are LOUDER here. Cholo lifts the poker, ready to strike. Just as he does...
SECURITY GUARD => Drop it! Cholo drops the poker and holds up his hands.
CHOLO => Hey, no problem. TWO MORE SECURITY GUARDS come through the apartment's front door and rush into the kitchen. CHOLO No problem, no problem! But there is a problem. There's a dead guy
ALONE HERE! => She fumbles with the weapon, not knowing how to make it work.
CHOLO => You wanna talk about this? I did what I had to do. I only did what I had to do!
37                                                            37 => RILEY and CHARLIE step into the CELLAR of an old BROWNSTONE. Dirt floor. Stone walls. The place is filled with smoke and BUZZING with FLIES. As Riley and Charley turn their guns over to TWO BIG BRUISERS inside, a TOUT named ROACH sidles over. TOUT Supply run last night, uh? Bet you have some money in your pocket. I can show you how to turn that money into more money. RILEY Roach. Where's Chihuahua? TOUT
HIHUAHUA => Put me down! Put me down!
ILEY => What happened to my fucking car?
CHIHUAHUA => What? They're fixing it up.
RILEY => I went over to the garage. Your guys aren't there. The car's not there. My dinero's not there.
CHIHUAHUA => Hey, this is not me. I did not do this to you. I am your friend. Put me down. Come on. I find out what went wrong.
RILEY => Just get me the car, or they'll carry you out of here inside that fucking hat.
38                                                            38 => In a dark CATACOMB, DEAD MEN are chained to the walls. WHAM! A POLE shoots out. A NOOSE on the end encircles the neck of a captive Dead Man and is cinched tight. TWO MEN hold the pole while A THIRD sprays RED PAINT on the Thing's face. ANOTHER DEAD THING is dragged in and sprayed with BLACK PAINT.
39                                                            39 => Cursing in Spanish, CHIHUAHUA pulls a GLOCK out of a filing cabinet and jams a magazine up its butt.
distasteful. => BOOKIES drift among the spectators, taking bets with fists full of cash. CHARLIE What are they betting on, Riley?
RILEY => Red or Black. Who's gonna win the fight. CHARLIE What fight? Stenches don't fight. TOUT They do when there's food. The TOUT sidles over. RILEY What's on the menu today? Cat or dog? TOUT
new. => CLANG! Another gate opens in the cage. A hush falls as everyone awaits what will come. Including the Dead Men, who gaze with anticipation at the opening. What comes is...
RILEY => Give us our guns. BRUISER You leavin'? Riley cocks his M-16.
RILEY => In a little while. In the ring, BLACK reaches for SLACK again. With one lightning-fast move, she kicks it in the chest, sending it flying into Red's arms. Red shoves Black aside.
GOON => No guns in here! Riley gives him a rifle butt in the face and moves on.
ILEY => You okay?
CHIHUAHUA => My suit! You fucked up my new suit!
POLICEMAN => Hold it! ..FOUR POLICEMEN burst in. The Goons lower their weapons. Riley runs back to the cage, BLASTS the lock on the nearest gate, and rushes inside. Slack's body is lying on the floor. He suspects she's dead. When her BODY MOVES, he suspects worse. He plants the barrel of his M-16 against her temple.
SLACK => I'm alright, I'M ALRIGHT!
SLACK => ucker got my right arm. I'm a lefty.
RILEY => Seen you around. SLACK Seen you around.
POLICEMAN => The hell happened here?
RILEY => Somebody shot the little fat man.
POLICEMAN => Yeah, I see that. You're under arrest.
41                                                               41 => A UNIFORMED GUARD leaves CHOLO in a PRISTINE WHITE conference room with glass walls overlooking the rotting CITY far below. Cholo sets the case of champagne and the box of Cohibas on a conference table. A SMAN stands in SILHOUETTE at the windows.
ILHOUETTED MAN => How was Uniontown?
CHOLO => Dead.
CHOLO => I got something else, too.
SILHOUETTED MAN => Thank you.
CHOLO => No, thank you! Twenty grand. That's what I got comin' for last night. I never bothered to pick it up.
ILHOUETTED MAN => You didn't?
CHOLO => Nope. I left it in the bank. Your bank. With all my other dough. rom all those other nights. I got enough now to buy me a place.
SILHOUETTED MAN => You mean here? In the Green? The Silhouetted Man steps away from the window. Expensively dressed, in his early 60s, he is PAUL KAUFMAN. He sets down the highball glass Cholo gave him, gets out a proper champagne flute, and fills it from the bottle, smiling politely at Cholo.
KAUFMAN => I'm sorry, Mister DeMora, but there's a very long waiting list.
CHOLO => How long?
KAUFMAN => This is an extremely desirable location. Space is limited.
CHOLO => You mean restricted.
KAUFMAN => Well, I do have a board of directors, a membership committee that has to approve...
HOLO => I guess it takes more than money to become a "member".
KAUFMAN => Take my advice. Withdraw your funds from the bank and spend them somewhere else.
CHOLO => Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me.
AUFMAN => I'm sorry, but...
CHOLO => No, no, no. Three years! Three years I been cleaning up after you, taking out your garbage, and you tell me I'm not good enough? You're the one who's no good. You are no fucking good. And you are gonna let me in. You know why? Because I know what goes on around here. How many of your fucking "members" know what's in that garbage I take out for you?
KAUFMAN => Maybe we should talk about this when you're less excited.
KAUFMAN => Softly) I won't be needing this man any more.
43                                                            43 => RILEY RIPS off part of his shirt-sleeve and starts to bandage the wound on SLACK'S arm. They are in a jail cell that has brick walls and a small barred window facing a dark alley. CHARLIE, stripped of all his guns, stares outside longingly.
RILEY => Why you? In that arena. Why did the little fat man throw you in with those things?
SLACK => It wasn't the little man. It was the big man. The man upstairs. He's got his fingers in everything down here. If you can drink it, shoot it up, fuck it, or gamble on it, it belongs to him. He's just seein' that we get a few cheap kicks so we don't go thinkin' too hard about why he's eating steak and the rest of us are lucky to get the bones.

RILEY => I don't need to hear your story. Everybody's got a story, and I'm tired of hearin' them all!
SLACK => What's your story, Riley?
ILEY => I said everybody has a story. That was wrong. I don't have one. Daddy was a preacher. Mama kept the house. School. Engineering. Nothing bad ever happened to me...(turning away)...till everything changed.
LACK => Everything changed for all of us. Whether we had a story or not.

KAUFMAN => Yes?
CHOLO => aufman?
KAUFMAN => Ah. The one that got away.
CHOLO => You said we should talk when I was less excited. I'm a lot less excited now.
KAUFMAN => What do you want, Mister DeMora?
CHOLO => I can't have a place in the Green, fine. I'll go find another place. But you know what I'm gonna need? Money. I want my money out of your bank. And I want the rest of the money out of your bank. And if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna blow you out of your fuckin' ivory tower. I've got Dead Reckoning.
KAUFMAN => That's unfortunate.
CHOLO => Put the money on a boat and send it across the river to the South Side. Tenth Street Pier. One man to drive the boat, no more. You've got till midnight. Four hours. I won't be there. Dead Reckoning won't be there. But I'll know if it happens. I'll know if it doesn't happen.
UTHERLAND => Trouble?
KAUFMAN => In a world where the dead are returning to life, the word `trouble' loses much of its meaning.  He wants money. SUTHERLAND Pay him.
KAUFMAN => We don't negotiate with terrorists. There are other options.
55                                                             55 => CLANG! A FIDDLER'S GREEN SECURITY GUARD opens a cell door.

RILEY => I don't drink.
KAUFMAN => Well, then...please sit down.
RILEY => Nobody else is sitting. I think I'll just stand here, like the rest of you. While you tell me why I'm standing here.
AUFMAN => We need you to repossess a vehicle that belongs to us. The vehicle you designed, Mister Denbo. Dead Reckoning has been stolen. By your second in command. I want him captured. Or killed. And I want my two-million-dollar piece of equipment returned.
ILEY => The truck.
KAUFMAN => Which has guns. Big guns. That could do a great deal of damage if he were to aim them at this city.
RILEY => Why don't you just send out your troops?
KAUFMAN => I don't want to lose them. I could send five hundred men against that thing and they'd all come back in body bags. It's your vehicle. Cholo was your man. You might be able to get close enough to...do what has to be done. Do this for me and I'll grant you something in return. Residence in the Green. RILEY Not me. That's what Cholo wanted, and you didn't give it to him, did you? That's why he's out there waving a cannon at your ass. Kaufman won't admit that Riley's right, but he looks at him with a glimmer of respect. RILEY Give me one of those vehicles, over
KAUFMAN => But...there's nothing up north.
RILEY => That's the idea.
KAUFMAN => Alright. You've named your price. An easy one to pay.
ILEY => One more thing. My friends. They go with me.
KAUFMAN => Take them.

RILEY => Stenches have been at this place.
MANOLETE => When the truck pulled out, it must have knocked the fence down. That's how they got in.
RILEY => That fencing was pushed in from outside.
TEAHOUSE => You know how many stenches it would take to do that?

Beyond which is the glow of the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE. SLACK They want the city. RILEY The city is us. They're after us. We pissed `em off one too many times.

92                                                               92 => SLACK and PILLSBURY watch from the shadows as a HATCH OPENS.
93                                                               93 => RILEY and CHARLIE step on board. PRETTY BOY is at the controls. FOXY, ANCHOR, and SCAR stand nearby. Charlie is
CHOLO => I'd rather have you in here than out there. KA-CHUNK! Cholo lifts his crossbow, pressing a loaded arrow up under Riley's chin. BLOOD TRICKLES. CHOLO Who's the smart one now?
CHOLO => Thought you were gonna quit. Here you are still working for the man. Kaufman sent you out here, didn't he? To get the truck back. RILEY Yes.
94                                                              94 => SLACK and PILLSBURY creep forward, freezing as they see RILEY with the crossbow at his neck. Slack aims her K-90 at CHOLO, RUSTLING branches as she moves. SLACK That man pulls the trigger, he's dead.
95                                                              95 => CHOLO cocks his head outside. CHOLO Who else is out there?
RILEY => Kaufman sent some guys with us. We took care of `em. I know you
CHOLO => Yup. Pretty Boy, set the cannons.
97                                                              97 => RILEY keeps cool. RILEY Don't do it, Cholo. CHOLO Kaufman's got it coming.
98                                                              98 => SLACK and PILLSBURY watch THE GUN TURRET continue to turn, the cannon barrels angling toward FIDDLER'S GREEN.
99                                                                99 => PRETTY BOY lifts a clear cover off a RED FIRING BUTTON. RILEY Hit the tower square, you'll kill a lot of innocent people. Miss and hit the city, you'll kill a lot of our friends. Your beef's with Kaufman, not them. The turret on the roof GROANS as the cannons rotate. CHOLO He's killed a lot of our friends. Every week we took out the garbage, you and me. Every month I took out
100                                                             100 => The turret stops, cannons aimed directly at the GREEN.
CHOLO => When the smoke clears, I'm gonna
RILEY => There won't be any fancy shit left. And money burns. CHOLO Not when you keep it in a safe.
102                                                             102 => MANOLETE pulls one of the MACHINE GUNS out of its mount on the T-BIRD. Shouldering it, he creeps toward DEAD RECKONING.
104                                                             104 => The GUN BARRELS are cold. SILENT.
105                                                             105 => CHOLO punches the button again. Again. Nothing happens. CHOLO
106                                                             106 => ...TWO STEEL LOCKING RINGS swing up to cap the cannons. Just beyond the barrels we see MANOLETE closing in on DEAD
CHOLO => Fix it! RILEY Not a chance. Riley tosses the "Game Boy" out the open hatch. Cholo reaches out after it.
108                                                             108 => MANOLETE has the machine gun aimed at DEAD RECKONING'S open hatch. Where CHOLO is standing. Out of the corner of his eye, RILEY sees Manolete's machine gun barrel flash in the moonlight. MANOLETE FIRES! RATATAT! RILEY PUSHES CHOLO OUT OF THE WAY JUST IN TIME! He drops from the hatch onto the pavement, wounded in the shoulder. The Walker starts to rip Manolete apart. Slack SHOOTS HIM in the head. Then she and PILLSBURY open fire on the Walker, destroying it.
109                                                           109 => FOXY, distracted by the mayhem, lets CHARLIE get the drop on him. ANCHOR and SCAR go for their guns. RILEY unslings his M-16 and holds them at bay. RILEY Easy boys. Riley looks at the clock on the control panel. 12:01. Charlie follows his gaze. CHARLIE Geez. We just made it. Riley CLICKS the transmitter on.
RILEY => Riley Denbo calling the Green.
RILEY => I'm glad you feel that way. Because I'm taking your fucking truck.
112                                                           112 => KAUFMAN rushes in with his bags, dropping them beside other luggage that is already packed. KNIPP Mister Kaufman, sir. I dunno what's happening, sir, but it sounds bad.
113                                                           113 => SUTHERLAND stands at the edge of the roof, looking down at what Kaufman just saw. SUTHERLAND All this time Kaufman's been worried about a revolution on the streets. He never thought it would
114                                                           114 => THE SOUND OF RUMBLING. The CEILING VIBRATES, knocking tear- shaped baubles off a CHANDELIER. The SOUND BUILDS in
KAUFMAN => No. No. They can't leave. Not without me! KNIPP I think they just did, sir.
115                                                           115 => RILEY jumps out onto the street where CHOLO lies, bleeding from the top of his left shoulder. CHOLO I hate you, Riley. There's something about you I've always fucking hated. RILEY Same here. SLACK Riley. Look out there.
CHOLO => I didn't have to blow the fucking place up. Somebody else did for me! RILEY The stenches. They got across the river. They got across the fucking river. Get him inside. PILLSBURY steps in and lifts Cholo easily to his feet.
CHOLO => Wait, wait, wait. What are we doin'? Where we goin'? RILEY Back to the city. CHOLO Not this horse. You got the T-Bird?
116                                                              116 => RILEY closes the hatch. Blood trickles from under his chin where Cholo stuck him with the crossbow. SLACK reaches up and pulls off the bandana that holds back her hair, which cascades down. She uses the fabric to clean the blood off Riley's neck. He looks at her, touched by the familiarity of the gesture. SLACK Almost lost you there. RILEY I don't get lost so easy. (To PRETTY BOY) We gotta get across the water.
SLACK => We could blast our way through. RILEY Don't want to. If the stenches got
of it. => Riley runs his finger along the monitor, outlining the natural and man-made barriers that protect the triangle. RILEY We've gotta come in above the throat. His finger continues down the monitor to "THE THROAT" at the base of the triangle, where the long FENCE runs between the two rivers. RILEY What was built to keep folks safe is gonna trap them inside. We've gotta give them a way out.
117                                                            117 => CLOSE ON: KAUFMAN staring out his PENTHOUSE WINDOW, aghast. LICKS OF FIRE reflect on the glass. SOUNDS OF WAR can be heard from far below.
118                                                            118 => In the pristine plaza that surrounds the building, WALKERS swarm. CITIZENS run, screaming, including SOLDIERS, driven from their posts, who SHOOT at the Dead Things.
HOLO => I got it.
HOLO => Come on, let's go.
HOLO => I can't fucking believe it. (A sad chuckle) Nothin' works out. It's like...the world is spinning around and we're just...caught in the wind. Nothin' works out. Some damn thing always comes around the corner and gets you.
OXY => Your choice.
CHOLO => No, don't shoot. always wanted to see how the other half lives.
CHOLO => Take the car and get outa here.
FOXY => I'll get outa here. You take the car. INT/EXT. DEAD RECKONING - RIVER ROAD - NIGHT
PRETTY BOY => The old J&L'll take us over. Right outside the throat.
RILEY => Gotta get it down. PRETTY BOY The controls are in that booth up there.
123                                                              123 => RILEY jumps out of DEAD RECKONING. SLACK is right behind him. RILEY Get back in there. What are you doing? BLAM! She shoots a WALKER that has come out of the night.
SLACK => Making myself useful.
124                                                              124 => CHOLO jumps out of the T-BIRD and runs to the steel doors, unlocking them with a mag-key.
SLACK => You missed. CHARLIE Nope. I blew its ass off. The rat is now half a rat. Its ass has been blown off. Yet IT'S STILL RUNNING!
CHARLIE => Just didn't hit it in the head.
SLACK => Jesus. It's dead. CHARLIE They all are. SKREEEEEEEE! ZOMBIE RATS crawl up onto the roadbed. DOZENS. Riley takes off away from them. Slack and Charlie hurry closer, firing, trying to pick the critters off. The rats reach Riley! Nip at his heels. He leaps. Swings onto a girder. Climbs to the control booth. The rats don't follow. Slack heaves a sigh of relief just before... ...SKREEEEEEEE! A second pack of rats scurries toward her! She vaults over a railing, dropping several feet to... ...the riverbank below. But there are rats here too! Charlie fires at them from above. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FUR AND BLOOD
127                                                           127 => RILEY reaches the control booth. Draws his .45, expecting danger within. He steps through the opening... ...but nothing's there. Just a SPIDER WEB that sweeps over his face as he moves toward a RED SWITCH that activates a
128                                                           128 => RED LIGHTS on the caution gates BLINK, tinting the night. The silence is shattered by a LOUD SIREN that ECHOES across the river. The bridge's roadbed begins to CREAK down slowly.
129                                                           129 => THREE DINGHIES lie, upside down, next to the water's edge. SLACK shoves one into the river, climbing onto its upturned bottom. She pushes off. The boat doesn't budge. A tether holds it within inches of the shore. Slack pulls out a jackknife and goes to cut the rope, but...
CHARLIE => Slack!
130                                                           130 => Hearing the scream, RILEY looks out the control booth window and sees... ...SLACK being taken downstream.
Slack SCREAMS. => It's the BRIDGEKEEPER'S HEAD, its eyes blinking as it floats off on the current. he rope is attached to a stanchion on the opposite shore. Slack's muscles strain as she pulls on it until... ...her boat reaches the stanchion and she jumps off, finding herself at the same boat ramp the army of the dead used. The river has carried her into the very part of the city Riley and the team were trying to avoid. SCREAMS rise nearby. She's in the war zone.
132                                                              132 => THE BRIDGE IS LOWERING SLOWLY. Too slowly. RILEY scrambles up the incline of the roadbed and calls back to CHARLIE.
ILEY => Bring her over as soon as you can!
SLACK => Brian!
BRIAN => We can't get out! There's no way out!
SLACK => There will be. Come with me.
BRIAN => Daddy! Daddy's still locked up. Slack runs off with Brian, past a MANHOLE surrounded by canvas fences, "CAUTION" signs, and flaming OIL POTS. As MAINTENANCE WORKERS scramble out of the manhole... ...DEAD THINGS close in. The Workers, unarmed, pick up the ball-shaped pots and BOWL them at the Walkers. As the "balls" roll, their FIRES SWIRL, making them look like flaming comets. ome of the   pots CRACK OPEN, creating POOLS OF FIRE on the street. One   of the "balls" remains whole until it smacks against the   feet of a Walker. Then it opens. And the Walker is engulfed   in flames.
34                                                             134 => KAUFMAN and KNIPP, carrying the Prada duffles, rush out of an elevator with FOUR SECURITY GUARDS. Kaufman carries a gun. hey race into the street level of the three-story ATRIUM. Chopin LILTS, caged birds SING. RESIDENTS SCREAM, running crazily in all directions.
KAUFMAN => They can't get in. Downstairs. The car. The Dead Things POUND at the doors. One Guard runs away. The Other Three follow.
KAUFMAN => et back here! GET BACK HERE!
KNIPP => DON'T SHOOT! (Grabbing Kaufman's gun hand) Boss? Don't you shoot, neither. We're all on the same side. Least we're supposed to be.
ECURITY GUARD => I'm on my own side now.
CHOLO => Need some help, Mister K.?
CHOLO => been bit, Mister K. I'm a dead man, so I don't care about nothin' no more. Still care about you, though. I wanna make sure you come to the same end as me.
CHOLO => hey're going to get you, Mister K. want them to get you.
CHOLO => ut it down, old man, unless you'd rather die right now.
NIPP => Just let us go, Mister DeMora. Let us get out of here.
AUFMAN => You fucking spic bastard!
CHOLO => I think we should talk when you're a little less excited.
NIPP => Boss. We gotta get outa here!
136                                                           136 => KEYS TURN in the locks of cell doors, which SLACK and BRIAN pull open. MULLIGAN and his REVOLUTIONARIES emerge. Mulligan embraces his son and looks gratefully at Slack. MULLIGAN Let's go get our guns, boys.
137                                                           137 => ILEY runs out of a line of trees. In the distance, he sees...
38                                                           138 => THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: RILEY looms larger and larger as the vehicle closes in. He doesn't move. PRETTY BOY tries to turn the wheel. Too late. RILEY DISAPPEARS!
HARLIE => RILEY!
139                                                           139 => ...the two fourteen-inch cannons on the vehicle's turrets.
ILEY => We gotta blow the fences!
PRETTY BOY => Johnson's are loaded!
RILEY => Yeah, but they're capped! The barrels of the two fourteen-inchers are still capped. DEAD RECKONING keeps rolling. RILEY climbs out onto one of the cannon barrels.
ILEY => Number One is clear! I'm going for Number Two!
CHARLIE => I don't norm'lly need two shots, Riley.
140                                                             140 => FOOTSTEPS ECHO as KNIPP, carrying one of the Prada duffles, helps the wounded KAUFMAN across an underground PARKING GARAGE, a dark and spooky place, made more so by the SOUNDS of distant SCREAMING. Kaufman disdainfully SNAPS OFF the shanks of the arrows in his leg and shoulder. The two men reach a stretch LINCOLN. Knipp BEEPS the doors open and they get inside, Knipp behind the wheel, Kaufman in the luxurious back compartment, where he pours himself a scotch from the built-in bar.
NIPP => We eed gas.
AUFMAN => Shoot it! Shoot the damn thing!
KNIPP => You didn't gimme no gun, sir.
KAUFMAN => Pull out! PULL OUT!
NIPP => Sorry, sir. Keys are in the pump.
KNIPP => ord!
KAUFMAN => N-no, y-you're dead. (Realization dawning) Oh my God. You're dead!
42                                                            142 => CHARLIE works a joystick. The cannon turret GRINDS above. He takes aim at an area of the fences that is rapidly emptying of people. The fourteen-incher turns toward the fences. RILEY rides it.
RILEY => Shoot!
145                                                              145 => PTOOOM! PTOOOM! FIREWORKS "BLOOM" in the sky.
MULLIGAN => We could still use you, Riley. Riley looks out at the city, where there is still scattered distant gunfire. He looks at Brian, standing at Mulligan's side, his innocent face speckled with the blood of the dead. Riley shakes his head.
RILEY => It's all yours, Mulligan. 146                                                                146

RILEY => Stop. Riley picks up a pair of binoculars and looks through the windshield at BIG DADDY.
149                                                           149 => THROUGH THE BINOCULARS: BIG DADDY looks at DEAD RECKONING. For an instant, his eyes meet Riley's, as they did in Uniontown.
150                                                               150 => RILEY lowers the binoculars. RILEY All they want is somewhere to go. Same as us. BIG DADDY leads his band into the future.
CHARLIE => Canada. That's where we're goin', ain't it, Riley? RILEY If no one has any objections.
SLACK => No, we'll take you along with us.
ILEY => I'll try to make myself useful. To PRETTY BOY) Take us North.
