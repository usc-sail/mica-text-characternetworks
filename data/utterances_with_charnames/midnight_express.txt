LOUDSPEAKER VOICE => Pan American Flight 1 to Frankfurt, London, and New York has arrived and will be ready for boarding at Gate 7 in 20 minutes.
BILLY => I think I've been poisoned.

GUARD => Take off the glasses.
FIRST GUARD => Aaaah!
SUSAN => Are you all right?
BILLY => Yeah... Yeah.
SUSAN =>  D'you see this?  Janis Joplin died yesterday.
SUSAN => Overdose, in a Hollywood motel.
SUSAN =>  Never Was anybody like Janis.
BILLY =>  Never was anybody like you...
SUSAN =>  You can't take anything seriously.
BILLY =>  You're right.
OFFICER => Attention please, Ladies and Gentlemen. For your own safety we're conducting a security check before you board your airplane, Kindly file out the back. Women and children in one line. Men in another.
VARIOUS PASSENGERS => What's he saying?  I don't know... Marian.  Hey Marian, what the hell...
POLICE OFFICER => Idem.
SUSAN => Jesus, they do everything ass backwards in Turkey.
PASSENGERS => They're checking for hijackers. Any Palestinians aboard? Hey Harry, get rid of your grenades...
SUSAN => Billy, what's the matter?
BILLY => My passport!
SUSAN => No!
BILLY =>  Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
SUSAN =>  What is it? . . . Billy?
BILLY =>  For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay!
TURK => Just a minute!
SECOND => Nebu? Did you search him?
FIRST OFFICER =>  No!
SECOND OFFICER => 
SECOND OFFICER =>  Bomb!  He's got a bomb!
AMERICAN PASSENGER => Bomb!  Bomb!
FIRST OFFICER =>  It's hashish. just a smuggler.
SOLDIERS =>  Hashish...smuggler...hippy...
SUSAN => ...Billy...?
FIRSTOFFICER => Name?
BILLY => William Hayes.
FIRST OFFICER => Vi... Vilyum... Vilyum...
BILLY => Hayes.
FIRST OFFICER => Hi-yes... 
FIRST OFFICER => 'Merican?

FIRST OFFICER =>  Gel?  Gel??

THIRD OFFICER =>  You idiot, you fool. You told me the American was searched... and he's pulling hashish out of his boots!  You're all dogshit!
SECOND OFFICER =>  You worthless piece of garbage, where did you learn to search a prisoner?  He's been in our custody for an hour, etc.
FIRST OFFICER =>  Who searched him?  Who?
BILLY =>  That's it! That's all I have!
VOICE => Howdy, Billy. Howya doing, Ok?
TEX =>  I think these gentlemen have finished for the time being if you'd like to put your clothes on.
DETECTIVE =>  Are you afraid, Vilyum?
BILLY => No, I'm not afraid.
DETECTIVE => Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
BILLY =>  Yes...?
DETECTIVE => Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
BILLY => A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
DETECTIVE => Would you recognize him again?
BILLY => Yes.  I think so.
DETECTIVE => Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
BILLY => Yes.
TEX =>  You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
BILLY =>  Stupid.
TEX => Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
BILLY => But didn't have heroin.
TURK =>  Well I'm not up on all that. A drug's a drug seems to me Billy and...
BILLY =>  But it was my first time. I'm not really a smuggler, was just two kilos.
TEX => Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
BILLY => But just...
TEX => Just what?
BILLY => I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
BILLY => ...are you with the Consulate?
TEX =>  Something like that. Cigarette?
TEX => How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
BILLY => Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
TEX => How much did you figure to make?
BILLY => Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
TEX => Beats working.
BILLY => I was just going to sell it to friends.  I'm not a pusher, honest.
TEX => Got a family back there?
BILLY =>  Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
TEX => What's your father do?
BILLY => He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
TEX =>  Be tough on 'em.
TEX => Girlfriend?
BILLY => ...She was on the plane.
BILLY => She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
TEX => Lucky girl.
BILLY => Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
TEX => Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
HIPPIES =>  Hey Janet, why don't you go sell 'em some dope.
TEX => You seem like a nice enough kid to me Billy, but try it and I'll blow your fucking brains out.
BILLY VOICE => Dear Mom and Dad. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. know the confusion and the pain it will cause you.  And the disappointment...
BILLY VOICE =>  I really thought knew what I was doing with my life. I'd hoped somehow to get out of this quickly so that you'd never know about it. But that just isn't possible now. I don't know what's going to happen. But what can I say to you?  Will 'I'm sorry' make a difference? Will it ease the pain, the shame you must be feeling?  Forgive me...Please...
ZIAT VOICE => Git!
BILLY => Cold. Very cold. Can I get blanket? Blanket? (makes a gesture of a blanket wrapped around him)
ZIAT =>  Mo sell...Too late.  Tomorrow...
ZIAT =>  You be here tomorrow.  "Ayi Gedjaler"
VOICE => Pssst!
VOICE =>  Your cell, no key.  Open...! Blanket. Three cell down. You get me one. Take...
VOICE => Ziat go for night.  Go!
ZIAT =>  Brack!...Brack!
ZIAT => You, goddamn you, give me sheet. Give me!
HAMIDOU =>  Name?
GUARD =>  Vilyum Hi-yes
HAMIDOU =>  Vilyum Hi-yes...
HAMIDOU => Vilyum Hi-yes
BILLY => It was cold. Cold! I get blanket. Blanket! Cold!
HAMIDOU =>  No do. No do.
VOICE =>  Hey man, he's gotta walk, or his feet gonna swell up worse.
2ND VOICE =>  We take him down to courtyard...
BELL => Smoke this rocket, it'll cool the pain.
BELL => You gotta walk around some man, or your feet gonna swell up something bad...
BELL => You've been out for days man, talking all kinds of shit. Come on, we'll walk you down to the courtyard.
ERICH => Okay?
ERICH => How's it feel?
BILLY =>  About as good as it looks.
BELL => Getchmis olsun
BILLY => Getchmis...?
BELL => Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich something Swedish.
ERICH =>  Just Erich.
BILLY => I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
BILLY => Looks like a cheap hotel.
BELL => Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
ERICH =>  Feeling all right?
BILLY =>  Yeah.  That guy who beat me? (stops, slightly puzzled) I feel stoned.
BELL =>  'Figgers.
BILLY =>  ...He had a bald skull and...
BELL => Hamidou.  Chief of the Guards. Don't fuck with him. He almost killed an Italian dude couple months ago.  Bad news. He try anything with you?
BILLY => No... I don't remember.
BELL => With these fucking Turks, soon as the light goes out... I keep one hand on their feet and their feet better not grow.  You'll meet Max. He got raped something bad down in Section 13. That's the pits.
BILLY => The kids? Why are they...
BELL =>  Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
BELL => ...They tell Ziat everything. He's the squeal round here. Goes all over the prison.  Sells watered- down tea, blankets, hash, black money, nembutols --anything for a buck...
BELL =>  He was an informer on the outside but he tried to screw the cops out of 60 kilos of opium. Watch him, he's a fox.
BELL => Whatcha' in for, smuggling? Rash?
BILLY => Yeah.
BELL =>  History, man, history. How much?
BILLY => Two kilos.
BELL => Where?
BILLY => The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
BELL =>  Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
BILLY =>  Twenty months?
BELL => Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
BILLY =>  Years?
BELL => Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man...  It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
ERICH =>  Don't pay too much attention, anything is possible in Turkey. You might get bail.
ERICH => ...If you make bail, you're free. You can get a fake passport or sneak across the border to Greece. The Greeks hate the Turks so much they never send you back. The Turks know it. They just keep the bail. money.
BELL => Sure, keep dreaming and see where that gets you... like Max, up in the head, you know... (makes a crazy signal towards the head) You gonna eat a lot more fasoulia beans, Billy baby, 'fore you taste a hamburger 'gain cause you broke the law man, and you got caught...  And that... is history.
ERICH => The law is sometimes wrong.
BELL =>  The Law is never wrong, asshole. The Law is!
ERICH => New people sometimes get on his nerves.
BILLY =>  What did he do?
ERIC => He was caught steeling from a Mosque.  That's heavy here.  He got 30 years.
BILLY => Thirty years?
ERICH => Jimmy has more balls than brains. He didn't tell his parents he was in jail for a year and a half.  He says he got himself in and now he's going to get himself out.
BILLY => And you?
ERICH => Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
BILLY => What they give you?
ERICH =>  Twelve years.
BILLY => How much did you have?
ERICH => A hundred grams.
BILLY =>  It's not fair!
ERICH => There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
BILLY => That doesn't seem so bad.
ERICH => But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
BILLY => He wasn't even in the car?
ERICH =>  Aslan, there... 
ERICH => Killed a guy. But his father's a big gangster on the docks.  A "Kapidiye."  He'll stay in... twelve months no more, and get parole. In Turkey, murder is manly - "erkek".
ERICH => You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
BILLY => How long?
ERICH => Seven years...
MAX =>  Gastro.  Stomach medicine. Has codeine in it... Best can do
ERICH => Lawyers?
MAX => Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
ERICH => His name?
MAX => Who?
ERICH => The lawyer?
MAX => What lawyer?
ERICH => Who got the Frenchman out?
MAX => Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
MAX => Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
BILLY => What do you mean?
MAX => Get the... midnight... express.
BILLY => What's that?
FATHER => Billy!
BILLY => Dad!
BILLY => Dad...I'm...
FATHER =>  ...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
BILLY =>  Yeah. How's Mom?
FATHER => Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
BILLY => No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
FATHER => Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
DAVIS =>  Hello, Billy.
BILLY => Hello.
DAVIS => I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
BILLY => Thank you.
YESIL => Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
BILLY => Mr. Yesil.
YESIL => I know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge,  I arrange everything - just right.  And I think we get you bail. If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... But I think we get you bail...
YESIL =>  You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
BILLY =>  If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
FATHER =>  Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
BILLY => Dad... (pauses, glances at Davis and Yesil, embarrassed) I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
FATHER => Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
FATHER => Where'd you get that limp?
BILLY =>  Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
BILLY => Where you staying, Dad?
FATHER =>  The Hilton.
BILLY => How do you like it?  Istanbul?
FATHER => Well, it's an interesting place... (lowers his voice, a hint of a smile) Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
BILLY => You mean you got toilets?
FATHER => Yeah, with real toilet paper - and you don't have to use both sides.
FATHER => So now I'm eating at the Hilton every night.
FATHER => Why'd you do it, Billy?
BILLY => For the money... 
FATHER =>  I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
BILLY => I know.
BILLY => Dad get me out of here.
BILLY => Okay.
PROSECUTOR VOICE => THE world is now looking at Turkey. We are called the Heroin Supplier of the world.  Stories about us are in newspapers and on television every day all around the world. The time has come, your Honor, to alter this image before we find ourselves isolated and morally ostracized by the rest of the human race...
PROSECUTOR VOICE =>  ...We must alter this image by punishing only our own drug smugglers-but by handing out foreigners who infest our culture with their depravity ungodly and behavior.  We must start now - by sentencing this American, Vilyum Hi-yes, to the maximum sentence for smuggling, to be held up to the light of the world as an example of Turkish justice and its intention to halt the drug trade once and for all.. .I ask the Court therefore to sentence Vilyum Hi-yes to Life Imprisonment.
JUDGE => Thank you, Prosecutor. The Court will now recess to consider its verdict.
BILLY => What'd the Prosecutor say?
YESIL =>  It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
BILLY =>  Did you ask for bail?
JUDGE => The Defendant has been found guilty by the Court of the illegal possession of Hashish...
JUDGE => ...Therefore. this court sentences you, Vilyum Hi-yes to be imprisoned at Sagamilcar Prison for a term of four years and two months. This Case is now closed.
YESILF => Four years, two months. It's good.
FATHER =>  Four years!
YESIL =>  We appeal it.
YESIL => You will see, he will have maybe one year taken off this sentence for good behaviour. Remember, it is only for possession; the prosecutor wanted life sentence for smuggling...  To be honest Mr. Hayes, it is a great victory!
FATHER =>  ...With good time Billy it works out to about 3 years... then there's the appeal.  Yesil, Davis, they're all working for you We're going to try to make a deal to get you transferred to a Stateside prison. And Davis thinks there might be a political amnesty any month...
FATHER => Look - I know it sounds tough, Billy, but we're gonna get you out...
FATHER => ...I promise you, but I don't want you to get stupid again. Pull anything.  They can play with your sentence.
FATTIER =>  I'm putting $500 in the bank for you.  Anything you need you write...
FATHER => There's food, candy, writing paper, soap, books... (his eyes start to water) ...cigarettes, soap, tooth-brush, there's... Jesus! (cracks, throws down the cigarette carton) I been writing insurance policies on people for thirty goddamn years... (laughs and cries at the same time) And now I gotta see my own son...Jesus! Jesus!  If I could be where you are Billy, I'd be there... Goddamn Jesus!  These bastards.
BILLY => DAD!
FATHER => Oh Jesus! 
FATHER => You take good care of my boy, you hear, or I'll have your fucking head, you Turkish bastard!
BILLY => Dear Susan.  1970 has now passed into 1971.  You can drift in here and never know you're gone. You can fade so far out and you don't know where you are anymore or where anything else is...
BILLY =>  I find loneliness is a physical pain which hurts all over; you can't isolate it in one part of your body. I so much need your softness, your strength. I have your letters. They charge me, give me courage.News about amnesty and getting out - tangled, complicated...
VOICE => ...I feel myself drifting more heavily into smoking hashish. The haze helps the time pass. Also I do soap carvings.  Erich taught me. And I have been learning Turkish because it helps me to deal with the guards and the prisoners. I'm trying hard to maintain some sort of schedule to my life, but sometimes it seems like I'm just trying in order to try...
BILLY =>  ... In the daytimes we sometimes play volleyball against the big Turkish gangsters...
BILLY => ...To the Turks all foreigners are "ayip" - unclean, dirty. We don't shave our under-arms or around our crotch...
BILLY VOICE =>  Even the yoga I sometimes do is "ayip" - too suggestive...
BILLY =>  And you're never supposed to eat with your left hand. You know why? Because that's what they use to wipe their asses with instead of toilet paper.  And yet they hate pigs. There are no pigs in Turkey. They're considered dirty...
BILLY VOICE =>  So is homosexuality. That's a big crime here but most of them do it every chance they get.  There are about a thousand things that are "ayip".  But they're really so hypocritical, like children breaking the rules. For instance...
BILLY VOICE =>  ...You can stab or shoot some body the but not above the waist because that's intent to kill. So everybody runs around stabbing everyone else in the ass.  That's what they call 'Turkish revenge'.  There's also a lot of "Baksheesh" that's a favorite Turkish word for bribery...
HAMIDOU => Unfortunately my youngest son Arief is having problems with his teeth; he needs braces, but dentists are so expensive these days
ASLAN =>  Poor kid... You know I have a friend, a very good friend; he's a dentist; maybe he could get you some braces at a... reasonable price.
HAMIDOU =>  Oh, no...it's out of the question...wouldn't want to ask your friend...
ASLAN => Yes. Please! As a favour... I insist
BILLY VOICE =>  Hamidou hints that he needs new braces for one of his sons.  Aslan of course has a friend who's a dentist.  They bullshit for half an hour and Hamidou finally accepts the "Baksheesh" in return...
BILLY VOICE =>  Dope and all kinds of shipments get delivered to Aslan, who re- sells it through his runners. People like Ziat.  But one night, it backfired...
BILLY VOICE =>  There were thousands of yellow nembutols.  Aslan as usual had the privilege of going into the courtyard before anybody else to pick up his stuff but...
BILLY =>  ...it happened to be a new guard that day and he didn't understand the system.
GUARD => No. It's too early.
ASLAN => Open the fucking Gate, you asshole! Do you know who I am? You want to get in trouble!
GUARD =>  Hey, I your mother! Get back to your bunk.
PRISON DIRECTOR => Aslan...be reasonable. Come down and talk.
ASLAN =>  You come up here and talk!
PRISON DIRECTOR =>  Aslan... if you give up the gun, you can keep the bullets
BILLY =>  A week later Aslan had a new gun...
BILLY => ...I know all this must sound crazy to you, but this place is crazy...
BILLY =>  Everything is "sula-bula" which means "like this, like that" - you never know what will happen. One day one of the new kids was raped in the children's kogus, so they picked out six of the worst kids...
HAMIDOU => PIS!  PIS" 
HAMIDOU => You see Mamur, Mamet - what happens when you're not a good boy.
BILLY VOICE =>  Then there's Ziat.  The more I know of him...
BILLY VOICE => ...the more hate him.
MAX => Ten dollars for this shit?  You greedy one-eyed git.
ZIAT => NO!   Is good! (gets his English wrong) Me good shit. (Meaning my shit is good)
MAX => No!  You big shit!
ZIAT => Yeah! Efe big shit.
ZIAT => JAAAASH!
MAX => You asshole!
MAX => Hikmet come here boy.  Hikmet
BILLY =>  What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
ZIAT => Cat, ah!  Ayip!
BILLY => You're ayip!
ZIAT =>  Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
BILLY => But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
ZIAT =>  I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
BILLY =>  Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
ZIAT => You 'Merican.  You don't know.
BILLY => Know what?
ZIAT => Was.. (makes gesture with his fingers) ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
BILLY => Learn what?
ZIAT => Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
BILLY => That's a great philosophy.
ZIAT =>  You 'Merican.  You don't know.
MAX => Here Hikmet!  Come down here boy! Hikmet...
MAX => Sodding cat!
YESIL =>  The new American Ambassador here is following your case very closely. He says there is progress. But there is another route that is quite possible... (lowers his voice and leans close) ...For the proper amount of money it is possible I can convince certain officials to lose track of your papers before the High Court in Ankara confirms the sentence of the Lower Court in Istanbul... You would not exist; and you could be in Greece by the time the Turkish courts discovered a stupid clerical mistake...But I have to act before the official sentence is handed down, and for that I must pay certain officials in advance...
SUSAN => ...My dearest Billy. I know it is long and it is hard for you, but your family and I are thinking about you all the time. I am trying hard to make enough money nights to come and see you.  Your father says that lawyer Yesil wants another $2000.  I know you distrust him more and more, but your father wants to do everything he can, and he is borrowing all he can on the mortgage of the house.  Money seems to be the only way out of there. Except of course the other way...
SUSAN =>  ...But I cannot say I am for it. Nor are your parents. They consulted the priest, and he said to send you money for that reason would be like sealing your death.
BELL =>  The blueprints!
MAX => To what?
BELL => The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
MAX => Too bad you didn't have a machine.
BELL =>  There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
BILLY => Tunnel?
BELL =>  It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
BELL => The Kraut said there's a whole bunch of hollow sealed shafts sort of like dumbwaiters running along this wall; one of them is right in there, right next to our shower. We get in there, he says, we can get down into the catacombs. With three of us working.... 
MAX => Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
BELL =>  Stop shitting me, man!
BILLY =>  But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
MAX => I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
BELL =>  Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip! (a fierce look at Max then back to Billy) We go through the wall.
BILLY =>  We go through the wall?
MAX =>  We go through the wall.
BELL => ...The Kraut was right!  I checked it out - there's no reinforced steel in those bath walls. They're real soft from underground seepage--
BELL =>  --the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
MAX => And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
BELL => The catacoombs?  Whaddya want, a door?  There's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul.
MAX => You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
BILLY => Section 13?
MAX =>  Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
BILLY => Where is it?
MAX => I don' t know. It's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
BELL =>  Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean... (straight at Max, Billy, very sincere, his eyes almost watering) ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
MAX =>  Shit.
BELL => Billy?
BILLY => ...The roof sounds better to me than digging through a wall.  Ziat's round there all the time. But the roof.... 
BILLY => The bullet percentage is awful high.
BILLY => If I get caught, Jimmy, I'm facing another months. I'd be back up to 3 years, maybe more...
BELL => Well fuck it!  Choose your own death, babe, I'm taking the roof out of here!
BILLY => Dear Susan. Poor Jimmy was caught and beaten so badly he got a severe hernia and lost a testicle. He's been in the hospital for months having operations..
BILLY VOICE =>  ...In comparison my problems seem very small. But two and a half years have now gone by, and in their own fashion, the Turks are slowly draining my life away...
BILLY => ...I have problems with my stomach and my leg muscles feel very weak. My gums seem to be shrinking and they sometimes bleed when I massage them... They've pulled five of my teeth...
BILLY =>  ...sometimes they null the wrong one...
BILLY VOICE =>  ...even my dreams don't seem to work any more. Because the outside doesn't seem real any more. It's not even a fantasy...because there is no fantasy.
BILLY =>  Even masturbation has become boring. It teaches you, like the rest of prison life, to seal up your emotions, and this is the greatest danger, this is what makes so many of the men change into something monstrous...
BILLY VOICE =>  It is Erich who has taught me how it is to be conscious, to channel and direct my energy.  He has convinced me to stop smoking hashish, he is the calmest man I have ever known.  If you don't control your energy in here if can blow you apart like with Bell. And you can't waste it either.  You have to weigh up every one of your actions - for and against.  Too little sex, too much sex either will throw you off balance...
BILLY VOICE =>  ...he has taught me about feelings, and the need to express them.  And he has taught me about love...
BILLY VOICE =>  ...and what love really is, beyond its physical forms.. .I think up to now I have only considered my own self, never really another...
BILLY VOICE => ...and now strange as it seems, Susan, without having seen you in so long I feel myself more inside of you than ever before. I feel your female mind.  I sense you, touch you; ...know you; and find myself falling more and more... in love with you.
BILLY =>  A prison a monastery a cloister a cave, Prison monastery cloister cave, Prison monastery cloister cave, Prison monastery cloister cave, Prison monastery cloister...
BILLY => Prison.
BILLY => Dear Susan. Erich has been transferred to a prison back in Sweden. He has profoundly affected my life and though I am lonely without him I am calmer than ever...
BILLY =>  Though I only have 53 days left, I feel I have never been so well adjusted to prison and to living as now....
BELL => Allah fuck Off!
BELL => Asina Covaciml. 
BILLY =>  ...Poor Jimmy...
BILLY VOICE =>  ...Though his health is bad he still won't give up...
BILLY =>  ...He still talks of escape.
BILLY => What's wrong?
DAVIS => Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
BILLY => Something happen to Dad?... Mom?
DAVIS => No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
BILLY => What do you mean?
DAVIS => The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
BILLY => And?
DAVIS => We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
DAVIS =>  There were 35 judges on the High Court. Twenty eight of them voted for a life sentence.
DAVIS => The Lower Court in Istanbul will have to go along with the decision. The Judge likes you and he'll do the only thing he can do under the law.... . He'll reduce the sentence to thirty years... We're notified... Billy.
BILLY => What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
DAVIS =>  Billy!  Please!
BILLY => FOR WHAT!  FOR WHAT!
BILLY => I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT!
BILLY => I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT!
BILLY => ...What is the crime?  And what is the punishment?  The answer seems to vary from place to place, and from time to time. What's legal today is suddenly illegal tomorrow cause some society says it's so; and what's illegal yesterday all of a sudden gets legal today because everybody's doing it and you can't throw everybody in jail. Well I'm not saying this is right or wrong. It's just the way things are....
BILLY =>  But I spent the last three and a half years of my life in your prison and I think I paid for my error and if it's your decision today to sentence me to more years, I... I...  You know my lawyers told me 'be cool Billy don't get upset, don't get angry, if you're good I can maybe get a pardon, an amnesty, an appeal, this that and the other thing.' Well that's been going down now for 35 years...
BILLY =>  And I've been playing it cool and I've been good and now I'm damn tired of being good cause you people gave me the belief that I had 53 days left.  You hung 53 days in front of my eyes and then you took those 53 days away, and Mister Prosecutor!  I just wish you could...
BILLY => ... stand right here where I'm standing and feel what that... ...feels like, cause then you'd know something you don't know you'd know what means, Mister Prosecutor and you'd know the concept of a society is based on the quality of its mercy means, of its sense of fair play, its sense of justice... but (shrugs and scoffs at himself) I guess that's just like asking a bear to shit in a toilet...
BILLY =>  For a nation of pigs, it's funny you don't eat them.  Fuck it, give me the sentence. Jesus forgave the bastards, but I can't. I hate you. Nation. I hate your I hate your people. And I fuck your sons and daughters!
BILLY => ...cause you're all pigs.
TRANSLATOR => Would Your honor like me to translate?
JUDGE => That won't be necessary
JUDGE =>  My hands are tied by Ankara!
TRANSLATOR => My hands are tied by Ankara!
JUDGE => I must sentence you, Vilyum Hiyes...
JUDGE => ... to be imprisoned at Sagamilcar for a term no less than thirty years...Getchmis olsun
TRANSLATOR => "I must sentence you, Vilyum Hiyes, to be imprisoned at Sagamilcar for a term no less than years... "Getchmis Olsun"
TRANSLATOR => "May it pass quickly."
SONG OVER =>  "Mmmmm... got the blues babe, Got those old Istanbul blues, Said Yeah, I got the blues babe Got those old Istanbul blues... Thirty years in Turkey, babe, Ain't got nothing left to lose..."
SONG OVER => "Busted at the border Two keys in my shoes Said I was busted at the border with two keys in my shoes An they gave me thirty years, babe To learn the old Istanbul blues..."

BELL => You got that, shit face? Asina...
BILLY => KNOCK IT OFF!
BILLY =>  Cut it!  No more fights.
BILLY => We're getting out of here.
BILLY => Dear Susan. It's taken me a long time to find out that it's got to stop somewhere. I've learned painfully not to trust the Turks, the courts, the lawyers, the Consul, the United States Government, and not even my loving parents. There is only one way out of here.. The Midnight Express.
MAX =>  We're undermining the other stones!
BELL => We gotta take a chance and do that one next -  Then pull out this one - (pointing to the one directly left of the loosened stone, excited) Just jiggle it, scratch it out, loose nit up, it's soft real soft!

BELL => Nah, just covered with batshit!
BILLY =>  They went out over there: must be some kind of exit.
BILLY => Let's go back the other way.
BELL =>  The fuck are we?
BILLY => What time is it?
MAX => Two thirty.
BILLY => Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
MAX =>  It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
BELL => What the fuck we gonna do?
BILLY => We go back.
MAX => What?  You gotta be joking.
BILLY =>  We go back, seal it up again, and come in tomorrow night - every night 'till we get out of here. There's gotta be a way. Those bats got out someplace.  Now let's go.  Doubletime!
MAX => You gotta have a lot of balls for this
BELL =>  Count me out. (to himself, shaking his head) Who ever heard of anybody sneaking back into a fucking jail?
MAX => Yeah, what if got caught?
BILLY =>  Hey Max, don't make the dummy laugh.
MAX =>  Who's laughing?  I mean I find this terribly depressing... Can you see old Hamidou's face when he tries to figure this one out?
BILLY =>  We'll tell him we were checking out our escape route.  We wanted to be completely sure before we tried it.
BELL => Billy, wake up!  They found it!
BILLY => Who?
BELL => Ziat!
HAMIDOU => Shut up!
HAMIDOU => No do!  No do!  I tell you I see you again.. Finish!
HAMIDOU => Take him!

ZIAT =>  Fine.  Good.  Man to man.  We fight now.  And when finish I bring Hamidou and he kick you fuckinq ass.
BILLY => Max! Cool it! (looking at Ziat calmly) Ziat's just doing his job.
MAX => Bell's gonna talk. They got to find out. Man, we gotta out.

BILLY =>  Yeah.
MAX => I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.

BILLY => Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.
MAX => I want to cut his throat.
BILLY => It's already been cut.
MAX => Then I'll cut his balls off.
BILLY => If you really wanted to hurt Ziat 
BILLY =>  ...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched? (plays with the thought idly, then shrugs) If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
MAX =>  You know where it is?
BILLY => What?
MAX =>  I know where it is.
BILLY => His money?
MAX => 'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.

SUSAN => ...Billy, your family is fine. Senator Buckley just made a special plea on your behalf in the Senate. Newsday has written several big articles about you.  They've called you a pawn in the poppy game between Nixon and the Turks. The letters are coming in, Billy. People care....
BILLY =>  Take it off. Take it off! (then remembering the English) Take it off. Take it off!

AHMET => Why you go?  Why don't you walk the wheel with us? (suspiciously leaning forward, suddenly realizing the answer) The bad machine doesn't know he's a bad machine. You still don't believe it? You still don't believe you're a bad machine?
AHMET =>  To know oneself is to know God, my friend. The factory knows.  That's why they put you here. You'll see. You'll find out. Later on you'll know.
BILLY => I already know. I know that you're a bad machine.  That's why the factory keeps you here.  You know how I know?  I know because I'm from the factory. I make the machines.. I'm here to spy on you.
