TESS => And love slipped the bonds of restraint... At a table under a willow tree sits Tess - early fifties, funky specs - at a laptop. She pauses in her typing, staring at Andy.
TESS => His touch was like a cosmic `yes'. Underneath a converted barn, cross-legged on a bench in a bikini top, sits Eustacia. She is hunched over a note pad, writing at tremendous speed, oblivious to all but her work.
EUSTACIA => `Fuck you,' screamed Kelly, `Fuck you to hell!' Scott stepped back from the cell door as the gob of spit flew.'
GLEN => This complex contemporary matrix is what Hardy meant by `the ache of modernism.' He regards it.
GLEN => Crap. He deletes it. He looks at his blank screen, breathing deeply. The only words left say `Chapter Six'.
NICHOLAS => Inchcombe had seen it all before. He'd seasoned it: the metallic smell of blood and gunshot; forensics hunched like vultures. The dreadful mundanity of murder, he thought.
NICHOLAS => He approached Patel, who was stricken. She was one for whom a corpse was still an obscenity. Inchcombe realised a disturbing truth. His lack of feeling was almost... 
NICHOLAS => Pathological...
CASEY => `I've been wearing the wrong size all my life,' said Katie. `I was always popping out. Turns out I'm a 30GG,' she says. `Now my bras finally fit - though Simon prefers me without one.' Jody checks to see if her breasts have grown. She sighs.
BETH => Do you think I should be reminding them to drink enough? It's very hot out there...
MARY => Beth - they're writers, not babies. You run round after `em too much.
BETH => Can I tempt you, Glen?
GLEN => Wow, thanks. Glen picks up a scone.
BETH => I often take something snacky down to Nicholas at this time of day. I know how the brain needs feeding. How are you settling in?
GLEN => Great. The last writer's retreat I stayed at kind of froze my balls off, you know?
BETH => Oh.
GLEN => Screeching firedoors, curried lasagne and a needy poet - from whom I still bear the scars.
BETH => We try to keep it peaceful here; far from the madding crowd.
GLEN => Well, it's paradise.
shatteringly dull. => Casey and Jody walk up towards the bus shelter. Their boredom is epic.
CASEY => Frock horrors. This weeks top of the shocks goes to Katie Pound in an off the shoulder lime by Roberto.
JODY => She looks like a bug. Wankers!
CASEY => You wanna sack your stylist girl.
JODY => Bet they did that on purpose, dressed her up like an insect. Casey agrees. They zoom away.
GLEN => Perfect harmony.
NICHOLAS => In Ewedown? Nadia, what the ffff are you doing there? I haven't told her yet.
NADIA => Why not? You keep saying you want to be with me. Jody and Casey are all ears.
NICHOLAS => I can't tell her just like that. It's twenty five years; a marriage.
NADIA => Come on Nicholas. Or I'm going to get in a taxi and find your farm. Come up there and -
NADIA => Drag you out -
NADIA => I want to be with you. I thought you'd be pleased...
NICHOLAS => Of course I'm pleased... Nadia, go to the pub and stay there. I'll come when I can.
NADIA => Are you going to tell her?
NICHOLAS => Just give me a couple of hours - He ends the call just as Beth is nearing the door - panicking the phone back on to its holder.
NICHOLAS => Cock pie. Beth opens the door to see Nicholas apparently hard at it.
BETH => How's the worker?
NICHOLAS => Good actually. Just about to embark on forensics.
BETH => Well give me your pages and I'll get started. Nicholas hands her several pages.
NICHOLAS => Reckon I might pack it in a bit early today. Need to think about my blood smears. Might take a drive; have a pint. Stir the old grey matter up.
BETH => Who were you talking to just then?
NICHOLAS => Judy. She says the Impala contracts should be through in a day or two.
BETH => I could come with you.
NICHOLAS => What?
BETH => For a drive. I don't know when we last went out. Buying time by biting his scone:
NICHOLAS => This is absolutely yummy.
BETH => We could go into Hadditon, get a meal.
NICHOLAS => Yes but. What about the guests?
BETH => Mary's got Casey to help.
NICHOLAS => But I'm supposed to be thinking, you know about the -
BETH => You can run it by me. I'm good at forensics. Nicholas has run out of excuses.
BETH => Can I tempt you, Andy? Andy takes a scone with a wide smile.
BETH => That's Glen, our new academic. Turns out he's working on Thomas Hardy. Said he might have some farming questions.
ANDY => Needs an expert yokel, does he?
BETH => Would you mind? And the writers are eating al fresco tonight; could you check there's no bird shit on the seats? Sorry. Beth looks distant, troubled.
ANDY => You OK?
BETH => Yes. Nicholas and I are going out to dinner. As she walks away, Andy glances at the shed, a look of puzzled dislike on his face.
GLEN => It's paradise...
JODY => Fucking bingo! Jody and Casey run away, laughing.
TAMARA => What a dump. As she drives away, we see Nadia sitting outside the pub in her urban heels, anxiously smoking a cigarette.
recent abandonment. => Suddenly a pigeon flies out from the porch eaves - just over her head. Tamara startles. It completely spooks her. She backs away. She doesn't know what to do.
JODY => We could walk up the garage.
CASEY => I'm supposed to be helping my mum up at Stonefield.
JODY => They keep you busy.
CASEY => Yeah.
JODY => You never stop, you! Neither of them moves. The boys are yelling. Two try to put the third head first into the bin outside the shop. Jody and Casey are not impressed.
GLEN => It was called `From Hearth to Heath - Doomsday and Revelation in Victorian verse.'
TESS => What was it about?
GLEN => Oh you know. Pale poets on laudanum, dark towers and sunless seas - a little sturm and drang in a teacup.
TESS => Did it sell?
GLEN => Well my kind of books aren't about sales. I mean that's not why I write. So... no.
TESS => What are you working on next? Upstairs, through a window, we see Beth is putting on a blouse.
GLEN => Thomas Hardy.
DIGGORY => Is there anything left to say about that maudlin bore?
GLEN => Excuse me but there is nothing dull about Hardy. That is a misconception.
TESS => At least you've been published. I'm seething with envy; I'd love to be published.
EUSTACIA => I publish myself on the internet.
TESS => Oh, do you earn money doing that?
EUSTACIA => No.
GLEN => So what do you write?
EUSTACIA => Lesbian crime.
EUSTACIA => I'm here picking up tips from the master.
BETH => But I'm ready. Come on. She's on her way to join him.
NICHOLAS => Is that - I mean - are you wearing that?
BETH => Oh.
NICHOLAS => Just looks a bit... hot. Now Beth knows she is right. She takes her jacket off, gutted.
NICHOLAS => You know, Haddition's always packed with pissed Londonites on a Friday. I doubt we'll get a table anyway. Let's do it properly next week; make an occasion. I'm always taking you for granted. I'm vile I know; you should kick me really, but - He's about to leave. Beth speaks calmly.
BETH => Who is she? The question hangs in the air. Nicholas' smile is frozen.
NICHOLAS => What? For a moment, he tries to find a lie.
NICHOLAS => Oh come on, Beth.
BETH => Tell me. Who?
NICHOLAS => Look, it's nothing. It's been once or twice, that's all. Beth, it's not anything. Beth is raw with pain.
BETH =>  Who is she?!
NICHOLAS => Just a researcher with Radio 4.
BETH => What's her name?
NICHOLAS => Nadia, Nadia Patel. This hits a nerve.
BETH => Patel? She's in your book.
NICHOLAS => No, no I met her when I was on Desert Island Discs.
BETH => You put her in your book!
NICHOLAS => Just the name.
BETH => And Desert Island Discs was a year ago.
NICHOLAS => Yes but -
BETH => Once or twice?
NICHOLAS => I was going to tell you but - Beth utters an inchoate cry.
TESS => Shhh!... Beth's pained voice drifts out of the house.
BETH => You lying PIG! A hush falls over the table.
NICHOLAS => Beth, I'm a ruin, I know - but I've been in a real state about this... I didn't want to hurt you. Another wounded cry from Beth.
BETH => How can you lie to my face?
NICHOLAS => Can we talk calmly about this? There are people out there -
BETH => You look me in the face and LIE!
NICHOLAS => For God's sake; we're surrounded by
BETH => You BASTARD!
are poised => like scavengers, waiting for more.
NICHOLAS => Beth, we're like a pair of compasses...
BETH => Don't you dare -
NICHOLAS => Joined solidly at the top but with the ends able to roam, in freedom - His phone beeps.
BETH => That's from her isn't it? Are you keeping her waiting? Nicholas finally snaps.
NICHOLAS => We've talked a lot about the creative mind and we agreed that it needs freedom to explore!
BETH =>  Take your freedom. I can't live like this any more. It makes me feel WORTHLESS!
NICHOLAS => Calm yourself down!
BETH => Go set up home with Patel. See if she does your tax return.
NICHOLAS => Will you please -
BETH => Do you love her?? Diggory's fork stays in mid-air. Glen is horribly fascinated.
BETH => Is she young?
NICHOLAS => For heaven's sake.
YES! => The guests are hanging on every word. Beth retreats back into the house.
BETH => If you leave here tonight to be with her... Don't come back.
NICHOLAS => Beth... For a moment, she hopes he'll apologise.
NICHOLAS => You're making fools of us both. Beth, tears stinging, picks a plant out of the tub by the door and hurls it, roots and all. It's a direct hit.
BETH => Liar. Glen cringes. Beth slams the door. Nicholas wipes soil off his glasses; brushes it off his shirt. He realises with a sinking heart that he must pass the writers to get to his car.
DIGGORY => I didn't know they provided material too.
EUSTACIA => Beth does everything for him you
EUSTACIA => types his manuscripts, deals with his agent, makes his female characters convincing. Nicholas still at the door, listening.
EUSTACIA => She even came up with the name Dr Inchcombe.
DIGGORY => No wonder he's bored.
EUSTACIA => I hope she takes him to the fucking cleaners. Nicholas walks to his car. Silence. He roars away.
GLEN => At the end of the day, this is why I'm glad to be single.
BETH => Nadia Patel. Gazelle eyes. Tantric sex. We see her thoughts: An exotic clinch. Nicholas in thrall to Nadia's confident passion.
TESS => Will she take him back, that's the question.
EUSTACIA => Would you?
TESS => I'd be torn.
EUSTACIA => He's far too up himself.
TESS => What about the farm though? Splitting up all this? Must be worth a fortune. I think she's very rash, making him choose...
NADIA => Thought you weren't going to come.
NICHOLAS => I was busy. Rowing with my wife.
NADIA => Where are we going?
NICHOLAS => Home.
NADIA => To your farm? A look of frustration crosses his face. He turns to her.
NICHOLAS => We could have gone on just as we were.
NADIA => But you said you wanted to be with me...
NICHOLAS => Yes. In London. Now and then. Nadia looks at him. The scales are beginning to fall. They get in the car. As they drive away, Tamara's car pulls up. She gets out of the car and takes in the pub before entering.
TAMARA => Big glass of rioja please. And I need a room.
ZOE => Sure, how many nights?
TAMARA => Don't know. Just one. Zoe pours the wine. She's disarmingly friendly.
ZOE => You here on business?
TAMARA => No. Business of a kind.
ZOE => I don't mean to pry; I'm just really nosey.
TAMARA => I'm from here. Sort of.
ZOE => Nice place. Tamara smiles her disagreement.
ZOE => I keep meaning to leave but... Hard to get away.
TAMARA => My mum's house is just up the road.
ZOE => You're not staying with her?
TAMARA => She's. She died. Zoe finishes pouring the wine.
ZOE => Have that on me. And here's your key. Up the stairs, right in front. You can't miss it. Tamara utters her thanks, surprised at Zoe's kindness. She takes her drink and the key upstairs. Zoe remains, grinning. We see why. Andy Cobb has just walked in. Zoe pulls him a pint.
ZOE => Didn't think I'd see you tonight.
ANDY => Bit of an atmosphere at Stonefield.
ZOE => Tell me everything... Andy shakes his head.
ANDY => Marriage. Remind me never to try it.
ZOE => Andy, you're just a sex object. No one'd have you. He grins back at her.
GLEN => So the Hardiments have lived here centuries, huh?
ANDY => No, `bout twenty years. Still strangers by local standards. Beth comes in, tense, anxious and haggard.
BETH => Andy, come and look at Ingrid. I think she's coming into heat. She goes out.
GLEN => She's a nice lady.
ANDY => Yeah, I owe her a lot.
GLEN => Husband's a sleazebag, huh?
ANDY => We'd say prick here actually. Or wanker.
GLEN => That's good. We might even call him a Fuck.
ANDY => That's good too.
BETH => This is going rotten underneath.
ANDY => Shall we look at Ingrid?
BETH => It's falling apart.
ANDY => I can do that. Beth... Andy takes the shovel. Beth bites back tears.
ANDY => He won't last five minutes. Beth looks down embarrassed by  his support.
GLEN => I know why I'm drawn to Thomas Hardy. He writes about failure better than anyone else. I need this book to go well. I need a tiny reward for my endeavours... His stomach gurgles ominously.
GLEN => I need a dump.
NICHOLAS => If that's the way you feel... Nadia, I'm devastated. Through the frosted window Glen sees Nicholas.
NICHOLAS => But if that's your decision, I'll have to learn to live with it. Beth comes in from the garden. Glen sees Nicholas quickly end the call. For Beth's benefit:
NICHOLAS =>  I told you. I love my wife. Don't ever phone me again. Glen is shocked by this duplicity.
NICHOLAS => Beth...
BETH => No don't touch me, don't you dare. Glen panics, realising their reunion is going to be right by the door. He puts his hand on the flush, hoping to warn them - too late.
NICHOLAS => I'm sorry.
BETH => Not good enough. Not any more.
NICHOLAS => I'm sorry.
BETH => You do what you like and then you're sorry?
NICHOLAS => I hate myself. I hate myself. Glen opens the door a chink. They are feet away from him. Nicholas looks unshaven, shagged and guilty.
BETH => Where were you?
NICHOLAS => Drove her back to London. Took all night.
BETH => You drove her home?
NICHOLAS => She was in a state.
BETH => Do you think she'll get over it?... Nicholas shrugs. To Glen's horror, he starts to cry.
NICHOLAS => I'm sorry. Then Beth is sobbing too. They are in each other's arms, holding each other.
NICHOLAS => I don't know why I'm like this. I couldn't do without you. Glen looks away from the clinch, horribly embarrassed. He opens the toilet window, puts the soap dish straight. Looks again - still hugging, sobbing, kissing - puts his hand on the flush - too awful to reveal himself - takes it off again. Straightens his hair, examines his teeth, sweating. He looks again. At last the emotion is abating. Nicholas releases Beth. She wipes her eyes.
BETH => I've got to go to the bottle bank.
NICHOLAS => OK... Let's talk later.
BETH => Yes. The goat's come into heat.
NICHOLAS => Has it?
BETH => I love you so much.
NICHOLAS => Me too. Beth goes. Nicholas is watching her; his expression strange. He walks away. At last Glen emerges, incredulous at Nicholas' lies.
GLEN => I've just seen the Hardiments kiss and make up.
GLEN => Looks like she's taking him back.
DIGGORY => When the hat is on, it means don't speak.
GLEN => I don't like cows. I mean really. They exude bovine malice.
ANDY => Yeah, these girls are killing machines. They don't like Americans either.
GLEN => Very funny.
ANDY => It's Winnards Farm. Lady there died a while back. Place is empty.
GLEN => You think it's being robbed?
ANDY => Prob'ly just kids. Nothing to do round here except make trouble.
GLEN => What if it's bad guys? Don't you have a blunderbuss or a fowling piece or something? They climb up through a copse.
ANDY => Used to belong to my dad, this place.
GLEN => Really?
ANDY => But it all went tits-up. Land was flogged to a consortium and the house was sold to Londoners; the Drewes.
GLEN => So this is your ancestral pile?
ANDY => Was. Born in that room up there. He points up at the back bedroom window.
GLEN => You must have been pretty resentful.
ANDY => Hey.
ANDY => This farm's mine, big nose.
ANDY => Hey, what're you doing? Tamara gives the alarm box a great whack.
ANDY => Who are you??
TAMARA => Andy, you moron; it's me. Andy looks more closely. A disturbing spark of recognition.
ANDY => Tam?... Hardly recognise you. Another whack. The noise becomes a high-pitched squeal.
ANDY => You won't do it that way.
TAMARA => Then help me!
ANDY => Used to do bits of work for your mum. Been keeping an eye on the place since she died.
TAMARA => What sort of work, graphics?
ANDY => I do horticulture now.
TAMARA => You're a gardener? Andy says nothing. He stares at her nose. Glen has come in.
GLEN => This is a great old house.
TAMARA => Would you like to buy it?
GLEN => I'm not really the property-owning kind. Prefer my life to fit into hand luggage.
ANDY => That's why you're back, to flog it?
TAMARA => Yes.
ANDY => Make a nice second home for some banker wankers.
TAMARA => Andy if you want it, why don't you make me an offer?
ANDY => Because sadly I'm still prey to the economic forces that threw the peasant classes off the land.
TAMARA => Unlucky. Tamara opens a cupboard. It's full of empty wine bottles.
ANDY => Tam. Their eyes meet.
ANDY => What the fuck have you done to yourself? Tamara's face falls.
ANDY => She's completely different.
GLEN => How was she before? What's the story?...
ANDY => There isn't one.
GLEN => Come on.
ANDY => Was nothing. Decade ago. Just a teenage thing.
ANDY => You should find someone you're in love with.
TAMARA => You stupid prick. Andy looks at her. She is sincere.
ANDY => You saying you love me, frosty tits?
TAMARA => You first.
ANDY => You say it; You're the girl.
TAMARA => Fuck off. She kisses him. As they start to make love:
TAMARA => I love you. Fuck off. I love you.
GLEN => Romeo and Juliet, huh? Andy carries on down the hill, shaking his head.
BETH => Thinking of the first time we saw this place...
NICHOLAS => You've made it a wonderful home Beth.
BETH => Not wonderful enough. She starts to walk away. Nicholas holds her back.
NICHOLAS => If you can't put this behind you, then we're stuck.
BETH => Well I'd better sort myself out then.
NICHOLAS => What has to happen? I am sorry - Beth brings her arm up to push him away. Nicholas catches it; draws her to him. He kisses her insistently. Beth's resistance diminishes. Soon it has gone. We begin to see the depth of Beth's physical love for him. At that moment, Glen walks round the corner. He tries to backtrack, mortified by his intrusion on their passion. Too late. They part. Nicholas turns away in frustration.
GLEN => Just taking the air. Flustered, he knocks into a tub of lobelias. Beth and Nicholas remain. The moment between them is gone. Round the corner, Glen is cringing.
JODY => Would you do him?
CASEY => No.
JODY => What about him?
CASEY => He's gay, you dobbin.
JODY => So? They turn to a big spread on a band called Swipe.
CASEY => Swipe.
JODY => Ben Sergeant... I'd walk through fire to do him.
CASEY => The drummer?
JODY => He's not just the drummer. He writes the lyrics; it's his band. He's the fucking genius, not Steve Culley or any of these wankers. It's Ben.
CASEY => OK. I'd do Ben.
JODY => I wanna be her, in that dress with him licking my teapot lids.
CASEY => Yeah... me too.
DIGGORY => People talk about the muscularity in prose. I want a similar muscularity in my verse. I don't want a poetry that's flabby or obese - that's why I adhere to the tightest rhyme schemes: Diggory picks the vol-au-vent up and without looking, puts it in his mouth. Casey moves over to Nicholas and Glen.
DIGGORY => ABB ACC DEE D. They give you the armature, the beating heart, the nerve ends...
NICHOLAS => So has the muse shone on you, Greg?
GLEN => I've been pretty distracted. Most recently by those delicious cookie things that Beth brought round this afternoon.
NICHOLAS => Oh yes. Of course we call them biscuits here.
GLEN => And by the place itself, the people.
NICHOLAS => Sometimes wish I could get distracted. Ten page a day man, rain or shine.
GLEN => Wow, that's scary. Ten pages; how do you do that?
NICHOLAS => Well, Greg -
NICHOLAS => I wouldn't presume to give an academic tips.
GLEN => Matter of fact I read one of your books. Another distraction but I thought it was decent stuff.
NICHOLAS => Well. He's offended.
NICHOLAS => How do I do it? I just get on with it, Greg. Nicholas walks away leaving Glen smarting. The female writers surround Nicholas. He tops them up, full of charm. Under his breath, Glen impersonates:
GLEN => `We call them biscuits, here.' Nicholas raises his glass for a toast.
NICHOLAS => To the muse, however you find her. He is looking at Beth. She is gratified. Then his eye shifts, his glass still in the air.
NICHOLAS => Who's that? Tamara Drewe is climbing the stile at the bottom of the garden in a low cut T-shirt, tiny pair of denim shorts and bare feet. The evening light bathes her in a golden sheen.
GLEN => That's Tamara Drewe.
NICHOLAS => No it isn't.
GLEN => I met her with Andy.
NICHOLAS => Good God. What's happened to her?
POPPY => She's had a nose job, Dad.
NICHOLAS => She's completely different.
GLEN => That's what Andy said.
BETH => Poor Tamara. Such a sad girl. She used to come and help you wash the car, didn't she Nicholas? I think she liked a bit of family after her dad left.
TESS => Is that Tamara Drewe who writes the column in one of the Sundays?
BETH => Used to. Writes for the Independent now.
TESS => She spent weeks going on about her nose job. Smart way to pay for it I suppose. Was her old one an awful conk?
NICHOLAS => Yes.
BETH => She's poured herself into those shorts. I hope they don't give her thrush.
TESS => What's the etiquette with nose jobs? Do we mention it, or... Tamara has arrived in earshot. Absolutely everyone, including a very curious Casey, is staring at her nose.
TAMARA => Hello. Sorry to intrude. Her hand defensively brushes her nose. Poppy walks towards her, full of warmth.
POPPY => Hey, Tamara.
TAMARA => Poppy, how are you?
POPPY => Love your new hooter.
TAMARA => Thanks. It isn't actually new; just smaller...
BETH => Tamara, so sorry about your mum.
TAMARA => Thank you...
BETH => Are you staying down for a while?
TAMARA => I'll have to. There's so much to be done.
BETH => You must let us know if we can help.
TAMARA => Actually, I was going to ask if you could spare a pair of strong arms. I've got a skip coming tomorrow and -
BETH => Nicholas? - Nicholas is opening another bottle of prosecco. It pops its cork over his trousers. He mutters a swear word.
GLEN => I'm available. I do skips.
DIGGORY => I... No.
TAMARA => Well thank you. You're very kind... Is Andy around at all? Beth is helping Nicholas wipe his trousers.
BETH => Oh, I can't spare Andy. He's making a new coop for my Buff Orpingtons.
BETH => She's had the writers down there helping her all day. I hope she realises they're here to work...
POPPY => Can't believe what a difference her nose makes.
BETH => Well I think it's a mistake; taken away all her character.
POPPY => Come on; she looks ten times better.
NICHOLAS => Huh.
BETH => And she knows it. I found those shorts really irritating. Going around with half her bum hanging out. I mean, why?
POPPY => To annoy people like you. Might get a pair myself.
NICHOLAS => Of course you won't.
POPPY => Why not?
NICHOLAS => Because you're not desperate, are you? Always something a bit desperate about Tamara Drewe. Beth looks at him puzzled as he works on.
GLEN => So why did you change your face?
TAMARA => Changing my face is the best thing I ever did. And I don't care what anyone thinks.
GLEN => Would it work for me?
TAMARA => Maybe; if you did the wrinkles too.
GLEN => Oh, you're just coming on to me... Tamara laughs. She starts work again.
GLEN => In your column, you write about yourself... Does that come easily?
TAMARA => No... But it feels right. My first novel's definitely going to be autobiographical.
GLEN => Your first novel? You're going to dash one off just like that?
TAMARA => Ideally, I'd like to make it into fiction before I'm thirty.
GLEN => And then maybe a swimwear collection, a chat show, a pasta sauce range?
TAMARA => What?
GLEN => Life sure is easy for the beautiful.
TAMARA => You know before I got the nose job I had no trouble getting taken seriously. Maybe, when they removed that bit of cartilage, they pulled my brain out by mistake - what do you think? Glen smiles, won over.
GLEN => She's single, man. Andy looks over at Zoe.
ANDY => Well it's not exactly a relationship; we just have an occasional thing. Zoe doesn't want to be tied down and -
GLEN => Not Zoe! Tamara... You should get in there. Marry the girl. Then you get to live back in your ancestral home.
ANDY => No way. Not her type.
GLEN => The trouble is Andy, you think like a loser. And I know that because I'm the loser that losers turn to for tips. I'm the losers loser.
ANDY => I'm a pedigree loser. I had a graphics business; went bust. And then with my great business acumen I invested in a polytunnel full of ganja.
GLEN => Wow. How'd that go?
ANDY => Made a tit of myself. Spent about six years stoned out of my box and I'm only just getting it back together. Besides, even if I was the last man in the world, Tamara Drewe wouldn't have me.
GLEN => Why not?
ANDY => I dumped her.
GLEN => Oh, you are a loser.
ANDY => I was twenty. My mates thought I was cradle snatching... And they used to call her Beaky.
TAMARA => Beaky?... We see her stricken face as she turns away. Then she turns back and hits Andy. His nose streams blood.
GLEN => You told her the truth... The time might come when she respects that. Andy, as your love guru, I suggest you ask Tamara for a date. But take a shower first, OK?
TAMARA => Boys know nothing. Nicholas looks up at her, smiles indulgently. Tamara stops work.
TAMARA => I've been reading `Inchcombe's Dose.'
NICHOLAS => Have you?
TAMARA => The bit where Doctor Inchcombe finds himself having thoughts about the dead guy's daughter. Tamara walks around the car, bringing her polishing cloth closer to his.
TAMARA => You describe her light smattering of freckles and her striking profile. So... She turns her head.
TAMARA => Who did you base her on?
NICHOLAS => What?
TAMARA => Have you noticed me? Nicholas looks at her in surprise.
TAMARA => Because I've noticed you...
NICHOLAS => Think it's time you went. Tamara is mortified.
NICHOLAS => You're making yourself ridiculous. This really hurts. Tamara takes the bucket of soapy water and throws it over the car - and Nicholas.
TAMARA => Nicholarse.
NICHOLAS => Oh, grow up.
GLEN => A man can dream, huh? Nicholas looks at him affronted - as if he doesn't know what he's talking about.
ANDY => Go on Ingrid; have some kids.
TAMARA => Pretty direct isn't he? He's not even bought her a coke. Andy turns. Sees her.
TAMARA => And he stinks.
ANDY => She doesn't mind; it's like Lynx to her. If she's ready she'll stand for him, if not she won't.
TAMARA => That's disturbing human.
ANDY => Refreshing basic. Darcy is up and at it.
ANDY => Thought you'd have gone back to London by now.
TAMARA => I wish. Looks like I'm stuck here for a while. Actually, I've got a proposition for you. Andy glances at the goats; bad idea.
ANDY => We should go for a drink sometime, Tam. You know, for old times sake.
TAMARA => So we can reminisce about how I smashed your nose?
ANDY => You didn't smash it.
TAMARA => Yes I did.
ANDY => It just bled. The memory is between them.
TAMARA => I've got to do the house up before I sell it. It looks like an eighties timewarp. Would you like the job? He just looks at her.
TAMARA => Painting it and tidying the garden? Good hourly rate.
ANDY => It can't be easy down there, Tam.
TAMARA => What d'you mean?
ANDY => All the memories and stuff. Your mum...
TAMARA => I'm fine.
ANDY => Is it that you want someone around? Like when you look up I'd be there too?
TAMARA => Jesus Christ, the goats are giving
ANDY => OK it's bollocks -
TAMARA => That's very sweet of you Andy -
ANDY => Of course you wouldn't want to fraternise with your gardener.
TAMARA => So... is that a yes? Andy doesn't reply.
TAMARA => Come on, goat whisperer - I thought I'd be doing you a favour. I thought you needed the work. It's all over with Ingrid and Darcy.
TAMARA => She's had a shit time but she'll still call him. He'll lose her number. He won't ring her back... Andy's face cracks into a smile. He is won over.
GLEN => No. He stands. He paces. He sits.
GLEN => Just write, you numbskull. You moron, you dumb fuck - write!
BETH => How's Thomas Hardy? Glen unburdens himself.
GLEN => I'm wasting my sabbatical.
BETH => Oh dear.
GLEN => I've been working on this book forever; why can't I finish it? I'm two years past my delivery date and Fantail could ask for their chickenshit advance back. I can't write. I'm fucking constipated. It's a disaster.
BETH => Crikey. He notices the In-Tray.
GLEN => Is this all his fan mail?
BETH => I do a couple of sessions a week, to keep on top of it. Pretty good at forging Nick's signature. Glen looks awed - and defeated.
BETH => Would you like me to read it?
GLEN => You'd do that?
BETH => Be glad to. If you think it would help. Beth suddenly sees Andy out of the window. He's leaving.
BETH => Sorry Glen. Just need Andy -
GLEN => Barging in on you; What an idiot.
BETH => If you're going into Hadditon - we're really low on chicken feed.
ANDY => I'll get it tomorrow. I'm on my way down to Winnards. Doing one or two jobs for Tamara.
BETH => She's got you helping her too?
ANDY => Just painting, decorating, sorting the garden. Beth is quite put out.
BETH => Andy, that sounds like a lot. I need you here.
ANDY => I can easily do both.
BETH => As long as you're not working for her in the hours that I pay you. Without thinking, she has made Andy feel like a servant.
ANDY => Sure, Beth. I won't rip you off.
ANDY => Tam? Got some colour charts for you to see. He sets out all the colours charts and plans he has been working on. Tamara appears. She is dressed to kill.
TAMARA => What would you choose for in here?
ANDY => Well... I'd have this one. And then upstairs in the bedroom -
OK. => She starts gathering her things.
ANDY => So what d'you have to do to get a cup of tea round here?
TAMARA => Make it.
JODY => This is our village. Our fucking field.
smiles. => At the other end of the farm, Nicholas is staring over the hedge with tissue paper ear-plugs. He pretends his arm is a rifle, like a little boy. He aims at the cows. He fires.
BEN => Sorry people. I resign. Swipe is no more. Steve Culley is a cunt. Ben storms off the stage. The audience are in uproar.
PUBLICIST => Ben! Ben! What's happening?
BEN => He's seeing Fran. I won't work with that tosser again.
FRAN => Steve! Don't! Steve is coming into the wings. He punches Ben.
STEVE => You fucking baby. Ben falls. He virtually lands on Tamara. They both hit the ground. Steve storms off - Fran following, calling his name. Ben is dazed. He looks up at Tamara.
TAMARA => Hello. I'm Tamara Drewe.
BEN => What?
TAMARA => I'm supposed to be interviewing you - for the Independent. She smiles sweetly, smoothing his hair.
TAMARA => It was scheduled for later but maybe now's a better time...
JODY => They should let us in free.
RYAN => Too right. They come here, drink our water, use our fields, they leave all their crap in our drains - Tamara's car sweeps past with the roof down. It is closely followed by a bright yellow Porsche. Ben is driving and his boxer dog, Boss, is in the passenger seat. Jody clocks him.
JODY => Ben! Ben! She jumps up and down in the road with both arms waving.
CASEY => What are you doing?
JODY => That was Ben from Swipe! Ben!!
BEN => That's Boss.
TAMARA => Hi Boss.
BEN => You're not allergic are you?
TAMARA => To indie drummers? Maybe. Who are your influences, Ben?
BEN => Everyone asks that. This your place?
TAMARA => I'm selling. D'you want it?
BEN => No, I want something else. Tamara grins. Jody and Casey arrive at the brow of the hill, breathless. They see Ben pin Tamara against the door.
JODY => Who the fuck's she?
CASEY => I seen her up at Stonefield. She's got a nose made of plastic.
JODY => How come she gets Ben? I've loved him since March. Just as Ben's about to kiss her, Tamara coolly opens the door and draws him into the house.
CASEY => Wow... Jody is gutted; feeling the full injustice of her life.
TAMARA => Would you like a beer?
BEN => Yep. Maureen Tucker.
TAMARA => Who? Tamara opens the fridge. Ben is inches away. He still hasn't kissed her and he's just about to.
BEN => Moe Tucker, with the Velvets. Five foot nothing. Used to stand up to play. Put the snare drum on its side and hit it with mallets. Mentalist.
TAMARA => You write all the songs; that's pretty rare for a drummer.
BEN => Everything you've ever heard about drummers is total shit.
TAMARA => You mean you don't spontaneously combust?
BEN => Only sometimes. She goes in to kiss him. But Ben grabs a pair of chopsticks from a utensils jar. He starts to play around Tamara, hitting the surfaces, the shelves and everything on them; a brilliant rhythm. He gets closer and closer. Tamara is utterly mesmerised. Ben stops. He still doesn't kiss her.
BEN => Any more questions? Tamara is speechless. He kisses her.
ANDY => Hey, hey - who are you, mate - lost, are you? Andy strokes Boss.
ANDY => Tam? You want breakfast? Boss bounds inside and disappears.
WOAH - => Andy is puzzled. He steps into the hall.
ANDY => Do you know about this dog, Tam - He notices two half-drunk beers. He wanders into the hall. He sees Ben's boots and most of Tamara's clothes, abandoned. The unmistakable moans of lovemaking are coming from Tamara's room. He turns on his heels, pained.
NICHOLAS => How goes the opus?
GLEN => Fine Nicholas, just fine... Their smiles fade. Nicholas descending into deep gloom, Glen into deep anxiety.
GLEN => It's his most obscure novel `The Well- Beloved'. Most people have never even heard of it. About this guy of twenty who falls in love with a beautiful young woman. Then when he's forty, he meets the woman's daughter and he falls in love with her. And finally, when he's sixty he meets the
BETH => Oh he doesn't.
GLEN => Yeah. Falls in mystical love. Hardy was like that in his life, too. Even as he aged, he only had eyes for young women. Like, in one essential way he never grew up.
BETH => In his trousers.
GLEN => He was still at it in his eighties. You know? Snow on the rooftop but fire in the cellar...
BETH => Why won't it come for you Glen? The way you talk about it's so engaging.
GLEN => Yeah but there's an academic style, you know?
BETH => Who are you writing for? Who's your ideal reader?
BETH => Because if you wrote the way you spoke... it would make me want to read Hardy.
GLEN => Really?
BETH => Yes. If you wrote like you were talking to a friend... Pass me that thing. Glen passes it, looking at Beth as she tightens a bolt.
BETH => Try it now. Glen turns the key. The engine starts. Glen starts to drive the mower, delighted. Beth watches him, amused.
NICHOLAS => I simply pander to popular taste.
CAITLIN => Oh your books are far more than that.
NICHOLAS => Just airport fodder... Glen at the foot of the table, finds this modesty rich.
CAITLIN => Your prose is so vivid. And Inchcombe - for all his flaws - is a man with total integrity.
GLEN => Who did you base him on, Nicholas?
GLEN => Excuse me. He goes to help her, leaving the ladies around Nicholas like cups around a teapot.
GLEN => Let me help.
BETH => They need dusting with this.
GLEN => I went to my room and I wrote for three hours. The time just vanished.
BETH => That's great, that's brilliant.
GLEN => I feel like a man who's just passed a gargantuan stool.
BETH => Super. Sprig of mint on the top. Glen returns to the dining room with two desserts. He listens to Nicholas as he serves them.
NICHOLAS => The real secret of being a writer is learning how to lie. A frisson of shock goes round the lady writers.
NICHOLAS => Because that's what storytellers are. Thieves and liars...
GLEN =>  `The basis of all excellence is truth.' Samuel Johnson. Glen's intellect wins the day. Nicholas smarts.
BEN => Are you done yet?
TAMARA => I'm just starting something.
BEN => That poxy column? Can't it wait?
TAMARA => Not the column. Just stuff coming out. Don't want to stop it.
BEN => Do it later. Play with me. Ben strums his guitar, determined to get her attention.
BEN => She is such fun she's sexy And she lives on an old farm But something gnaws away at me It's causing me real harm. Tamara, what can you do with it? What can you do with her name? Its stands there lonely and rhymeless It's driving me nearly insane. Tamara the lovely, the ultimate, dazzling girl, Make me pasta carbonara, Cos I'm ravenous Tamara, Then shag me wearing your tiara... Tamara is delighted. She leaps on him.
BEN => Hey - Andy? Andy looks up. Ben is at the bedroom window, naked.
BEN => Can you let my dog in? Thanks mate. Jody and Casey watch from behind the hedge as Andy angrily goes to let the dog in.
CASEY => He must like kissing plastic.
JODY => He doesn't love her. He's just on the rebound from losing Fran; numbing his pain with loads of empty, rampant sex. What he really needs...
CASEY => Is a fifteen year old from Ewedown.
JODY => So? Stranger things happen. He's only ten years older and that's nothing. If he met me, if he just met me...
CASEY => It'd be love, right?
JODY => Yeah.
BETH => Coo-er... In your parents' bedroom? Still I suppose being an exhibitionist is part of his job - strutting about on stage.
ANDY => He doesn't strut; he's a drummer. He sits on his arse.
BETH => Very good-looking, isn't he? Poppy You-Tubed him and we both got quite hot and bothered. Is that his car - the yellow Porsche?
ANDY => Yep.
BETH => Bit brash, vrooming through the village... But fancy our Tamara bagging a bone fide rock star. She was such an ugly duckling. She must be thrilled to bits.
ZOE => We're not open for another hour.
ANDY => Good.
ZOE => I'm going to move on soon, Andy.
ANDY => No way...
ZOE => Don't know if I can stick a winter here. The way the light disappears; it's doing me in. I'm a blue sky girl. Got to have some warmth. Andy just looks up at her, smiling his understanding.
ANDY => We all need a bit of that, don't we.
76A => Boss is having the time of his life chasing the cows. Penny Upminister, an uppercrust landowner in a horrible coat is trying to catch him.
NICHOLAS => Fuck Soup.
TAMARA => What's this?
BEN => What's it look like?
TAMARA => Ben... For which finger?
BEN => Whatever one you like. That's a nice one. Why not put it on that? He's pointing to her ring finger. Tamara is moved.
PENNY => Those girls could have aborted!
BETH => Calm down, Penny. I'll sort him out. Nicholas is approaching.
PENNY => It beats me why you people want to live in the country. You've got no sense of responsibility.
BETH => It's not our dog!
NICHOLAS => Hello, Penny. How's tricks? Penny is suddenly all coy.
PENNY => Oh - Nicholas...
NICHOLAS => You're looking great. Terrific coat.
PENNY => What, this old thing?
NICHOLAS => You look like royalty.
PENNY =>  Well, I try... Can't wait for your next book. Inchcombe's such a sauce- pot. Giles is always says `What are you reading Penny? You've got steam coming out of your ears...' She laughs like a drain. Nicholas joins in. Beth is striding away with the dog, infuriated.
TAMARA => So what's the ring saying, Ben?
BEN => It's saying hello I'm a ring. Will you marry me? Tamara looks at him, searchingly.
BEN => What's up?
TAMARA => I didn't know.
BEN => Didn't know what?
TAMARA => That you were in love with me.
BEN => The ring says I'm platinum with a long guarantee. So give me a reply. Tamara is grinning from ear to ear.
TAMARA => You're the best fun in the world. I'd love to marry you. She throws her arms around his neck.
TAMARA => Can I say it then?
BEN => Say what?
TAMARA => I love you. Tamara holds him, profoundly affected. Something akin to fear flickers across Ben's eyes. The phone rings.
BETH => Shhh! There are writers here, trying to write. Beth is in the hen enclosure, a hen in her arms.
BETH => This is a Buff Orpington. She's looking a bit peaky today. Not a great layer but she's very decorative. Beth puts down the hen.
BETH => We're fully organic - but I like to think that our champion product is the written word. Nicholas approaches, his hand held out, heartily.
NICHOLAS => The famous Ben - Swipe, eh? Ben just about manages to shake it.
BEN => Swipe's over. Thought the whole world knew that.
NICHOLAS => It wasn't on Newsnight, no.
BETH => Ben is engaged to Tamara. Isn't that lovely? He'd just popped the question when I rang.
NICHOLAS => She said yes? Nicholas can't hide his disbelief. Ben is insulted.
BETH => We're delighted for you both. Boss leaps up, straining against a chain.
BEN => Why's he on a chain?
BETH => He was out of control.
BEN => How'd you like to be chained up?
BETH => He was chasing livestock. He could've got shot.
BEN => They shoot him; I'll fucking shoot them. He takes Boss. Beth and Nicholas are left alone.
NICHOLAS => I think the word is gobshite.
BETH => I hope he makes her happy. It's hard for girls when their dads walk out. Gives them bad taste in men.
NICHOLAS => What's that supposed to mean?
BETH => Just saying her father left when she was a girl and -
NICHOLAS => That is ten pence psychology! You don't know what you're talking about, do you? He walks away. Beth is completely taken aback.
NICHOLAS => Patel's eyes were open, eloquent in death... He looks up. In the distance, he can just see Tamara talking to Andy in the garden at Winnards Farm. Nicholas opens his desk. He finds a pair of old binoculars. He focuses them on Tamara. She holds out her hand with the ring on it. Andy has his arms wrapped around himself, his shoulders hunched. He nods, affecting congratulations. Nicholas tries to close in on Tamara. But she turns and goes indoors. Also the yellow Porsche arrives. Nicholas puts the binoculars down.
NICHOLAS => He knelt down - forensics be damned - and closed her eyes, forever.
BEN => `Mai Buff Orpingtons. Oh, the written word. That's what the country does to you; turns you into one. What's up?
TAMARA => It's a shame it doesn't fit. Perhaps you should have taken one of mine with you when you went to buy it.
BEN => Yeah but I didn't know you then.
TAMARA => So... when did you buy it?
TAMARA => Was this for someone else? Ben shrugs, not wanting to admit. The truth dawns.
TAMARA => You gave it to Fran didn't you?
BEN => So? It's yours now. She never wore it. She didn't want it.
TAMARA => You asked her to marry you...?
BEN => It was a gesture, OK, when she started seeing Steve. Backfired, anyway. Look, I love you now. Tamara doesn't believe him. She is devastated.
BEN => It's not the ring that matters. I mean fuck the ring. It's just a consumerist piece of zinc. What matters is I want to marry you.
TAMARA => Do you?
BEN => Yeah. With my whole heart. And all the other stuff. Like my brain and my entrails and my whatever, pancreas. It all wants to marry you. He hugs her, starts kissing her but Tamara hardly responds.
BETH => She wondered if you had a delivery date in mind. I told her Easterish. Mind that cocoa, it's hot. Across at Winnards, Tamara's bedroom light comes on. For a moment, she gazes out. Nicholas gazes back.
BETH => There's a few invites; I'll pop them there. Just tick the ones you want to go to. Ben wraps his arms lovingly around Tamara. She draws the curtains as he pulls her away.
BETH => And Tim wants to know if you'll do your Christmas signing in Hadditon. I know he's always ungrateful but I think it's so important to keep these little bookshops open, don't you?
NICHOLAS => Uh huh. Beth is on her way out. She turns and kisses him.
BETH => Come in soon, my love. Nicholas stares out into the darkness. He isn't working. He isn't doing anything.
CASEY => Look at that cellulite...
JODY => She been sitting on a bead car-seat or what? Casey turns a page.
CASEY => `Her latest tattoo count was nine, including a Sumatran tiger and `Eternity' written in Sanskrit.'
JODY => She'll be getting a barcode done next. Right across there.
CASEY => Nice baby though. I'd like one that colour.
CASEY => That Ryan...
JODY => What a dick.
CASEY => I think he's cute.
JODY => No you don't. Would you snog him?
CASEY => Maybe.
JODY => Be like having a slug in your mouth. Ben's yellow Porsche speeds right through the puddle, further soaking Ryan. Ben and Tamara are both wearing designer shades despite the gloom; Boss in the back. Jody and Casey are both on their feet in a second.
JODY => Ben! Ben!
RYAN => Wankers. Ben gives them a grin and a wave. Jody's heart soars.
JODY => Come on.
JODY => She keeps this here for Andy.
CASEY => What if she's got an alarm?
JODY => Soon find out. Jody opens the door. They go in. The alarm is hanging off the wall, the wires pulled out. Jody grins at Casey, satisfied.
CASEY => What if they come back?
JODY => If you're too chicken, go home. The girls wander in, awed. Jody turns and grins, her eyes like a cat's.
NICHOLAS => Is that Claire with an `i'? Beth has a tray of mince pies. Glen is at her side.
BETH => What about you, Glen? Where will you be?
GLEN => In London with a collection of spare academics. I guess we'll be decking the halls in our own erudite way.
BETH => I'll miss our chats.
GLEN => I've been in a state of writerly bliss these last weeks. I hope I get to come back.
BETH => Me too. We'd love to have you. Glen doesn't want Beth to move away.
GLEN => You know, this is the best mince pie I've ever had.
BETH => Oh?
GLEN => If it was possible to have an orgasm from mere food, this mince pie would do it.
BEN => What the fuck are we doing here?
TAMARA => It's kind of research; I want to write about them. They're funny, Ben - come on. They move through the crowd.
VINTNER => The 2001 was the best. Someone just bought my last three cases...
POSH HIPPY => So I've got her this gorgeous Rajastani gagara skirt... Arriving at the mulled wine.
TAMARA => Besides, I want to show you off.
BEN => What am I - arm candy?
TAMARA => More like arm fungus with that face on. Ben, meet Glen. Glen, meet Ben, my fiance.
GLEN => You're getting married?
TAMARA => Uh huh.
GLEN => OK. Beautiful dress, magazine photoshoot - everything the aspiring novelist needs.
TAMARA => I knew you'd be pleased.
GLEN => Have a mince pie.
BEN => Can we get out of here?
TAMARA => Wait.
ARMY GEEK => In Field of Tares, you made Fred a corporal. But there's no such thing in the Royal Artillery. They call them bombardiers.
NICHOLAS => Oh, thank you for that...
TAMARA => Sorry. She flashes a smile at the Army Geek and puts her copy down in front of Nicholas.
TAMARA => Could you do it for Ben? He's my fiance. We're getting married in the summer.
NICHOLAS => So I hear. You have my heartiest commiserations, Tara. He hands her the book dismissively. Tamara is smarting.
TAMARA => Well merry Christmas. Nicholarse. She turns away.
JODY => We gotta live the dream, Casey. Live the dream... Jody and Casey jump up and down on the unmade bed. Jody pulls a black T-shirt from under a pillow. She holds it to her face.
JODY => Ben... Casey is looking out of the window. The yellow Porsche is heading up the lane.
CASEY => Omigod! A wild panic. They put things back where they found them.
JODY => Go! Go! Go! She nicks the T-shirt.
BEN => Why don't you sell it like you keep saying?
TAMARA => Because... I've started writing.
BEN => You can write anywhere.
TAMARA => But this is proper. Not just stuff for the paper. 'It's about my teens - and is working for me here.
BEN => Well it might be memory lane for you but it's doing my fucking head in. I want London. I want some Urban, OK? Are you with me or what? Cos I've had it with this place. Tamara is hurt - and deeply disappointed.
TAMARA => Of course I'm with you...
BEN => It's drab. It's depressing. And every time I look out of the window I see Andy's arse - what's that about?
BEN => We're leaving. Thank God. Andy looks at him.
BEN => Tamara says you sell Christmas geese.
ANDY => Yep.
BEN => Can I have one?
ANDY => Right now?
BEN => Yeah. Andy smirks, pointing at a big white duck.
ANDY => That one's spare.
BEN => Is that a goose?
ANDY => You can take it now if you like.
ANDY => What?
BEN => It's fucking alive.
ANDY => Oh, you want it from Tesco, all plucked and headless sitting on a bandage. Ben's curiosity gets the better of him.
BEN => How d'you do it then? Andy points towards an upturned traffic cone, held in place by a metal frame.
ANDY => Gently put it's head down there; then quick in the skull with an air rifle. Pluck it while it's warm, little pot to catch all the blood -
BEN => Do you enjoy doing that?
ANDY => No, but in my low wage economy, this flock's worth a lot.
BEN => You're a sick fuck, Andy. Andy has had enough.
ANDY => Grow up.
ANDY => I said grow up, little drummer boy. Ben thinks about it. He walks away. Glen appears with his suitcase on wheels containing most of his worldly goods.
ANDY => Tamara rang me this morning. Said to finish the house. It goes on the market in the spring and that's it; over.
GLEN => Why does the asshole always get the girl? He stands with Andy; comrades. Andy slaps him on the back.
ANDY => Come on. Or you'll miss that train.
JODY => It won't be just a shag, Case. It'll be an event. I'll be wearing like a gossamer slip with a bra bit; Prada. Or like a filmy, linen shirt, and... We see Jody's thought bubble. Ben is leaning against the door frame, giving her a smouldering look.
JODY => He'll be wearing a black T-shirt all taut over his buff bod and underneath Calvin Klein Boxers, black. Jody moves towards Ben. He buries his face in her neck as if he's found the love of his life.
JODY => And he'll have like one tattoo of my name and lush pecs and we'll have candles and white sheets and I'll smell of Allure by Chanel.
JODY => And he tries to stop himself but I'm a vision and he gets drawn into my power and it'll be like Uhhh... But also respectful. And my `V' plates will melt into nothing. She looks up. Casey is reading at the PC.
JODY => Are you listening?
CASEY => I like this.
JODY => What?
CASEY => There's this bit right, where her dad takes her for dinner and she thinks it's some big treat but what he's doing, right, is telling her he's leaving them. And she, right, she's gutted and she yaks all her food into a napkin and puts it on his plate.
JODY => So?
CASEY => It's painful. But funny. It's about her; Plastic Fantastic. She's sad, Jode.
JODY => Sad? She's a lucky cunt.
ANDY => So what about the shed?
TAMARA => Hang on...
ANDY => Am I dismantling it - or mending it?
FARM. => Tamara takes the phone out onto the balcony to escape the noise. She slowly smiles, knowing what he's thinking.
TAMARA => I don't know; the shed... What do you think?
ANDY => I recommend preserving it.
TAMARA => Really?
ANDY => Always useful, a good shed.
TAMARA => Well then. Keep it... Andy puts the phone down, grinning. Tamara is grinning too, sharing the same memory.
BETH => Really? Oh dear...
NICHOLAS => Yes, We thought it'd be a good opportunity to catch up.
BETH => Couldn't you do it another day?
NICHOLAS => Beth, you know what it's like. Judy's off to New York tomorrow. We can never find a window. Should be home around ten. He puts the phone down.
of unease. => In the middle of the cake she ices a big question mark. Then she quickly looks up a number and dials.
BETH => Hello, Judy?
JUDY => Beth, hello love.
BETH => I'm so sorry, I think Nicholas has got his phone turned off and um -
JUDY => He's right here. I'll put him on.
BETH => Oh - actually - don't worry - I've just found it. Beth puts the phone down, biting her lip. She is relieved, ashamed and ultimately not reassured. She looks to camera.
BETH => Nicholas has been telling the truth a lot recently. The cake, with its question mark, is finished.
CASEY => Roses are red, violets are blue.
CASEY => You are so fit I wanna shag you. Love from Ben pfwoor!!! Jody takes another swig with a wicked grin, she sits at Tamara's PC. We hear Casey knock three times on the back door.
JODY => Just messing. I got one from Mum, one from that peanut Ryan, and a mystery one from Ben.
CASEY => I sent you that. Jody takes another swig from the bottle of wine.
CASEY => Is that theirs?
JODY => It's my mum's; they don't drink this shit. She hands it to Casey.
JODY => Look what I'm doing. Come on.
JODY => We have to get him back down here. I'm sending him a valentine.
CASEY => No you are not!
JODY => From her address.
CASEY => He'll think it's from Tamara, you dipshit.
JODY => But I know it'll be from me. Subject: Hot Love.
CASEY =>  Oh God, Jody...
JODY => Contacts: where are you Ben?
CASEY => Look, there's that bloke my mum works for; Nicholas Hardiment.
JODY => Let's put him on. Who else?
CASEY => Uncle Andy.
JODY => Andy Cobb.  `Come to Winnards Farm. I'll give you the biggest shagging of your life. Love Tamara xxx.' They fall about giggling. Jody swigs more wine.
CASEY => Don't ever, ever send that.
JODY => I just did. Casey is appalled.
CASEY => You never! Jody nods.
CASEY => You'll spoil it! Jody - I love coming here and you'll spoil it!
JODY => No I won't.
CASEY => She'll know someone's read all her stuff!
JODY => I'll delete it from sent items. It's just a laugh, Case. I only want Ben to come back.
BEN => What the fuck is this?
BETH => `Come to Winnards Farm.'
ANDY => `I'll give you the biggest shagging of your life...'
ZOE => She must want a foursome. Or something.
TAMARA => How many times? I didn't send it! Are you listening to me? BEN! WILL
TAMARA => Why don't you believe me? I didn't write that email.
BEN => Explain it then.
TAMARA => Is this about Fran?
BEN => What's Fran got to do with it?
TAMARA => She's the reason you don't trust me. Just because she fucked around on you it doesn't mean that I will. Ben, furious, starts drumming again. Tamara boiling with frustration, walks away.
TAMARA => I wasn't pissed, or depraved or
ANYTHING - => Andy is outside his shed.
ANDY => It's OK, it's OK... The drumming leads up to a massive crescendo and stops.
TAMARA => Can you go to the farm? Just take a look, see if anyone's been in.
ANDY => No problem.
TAMARA => Thank you. Ben's really pissed off. He's massively got the hump - Ben appears from the other end of the large room.
BEN => Have I?
TAMARA => Got to go. Sorry. She puts the phone down.
TAMARA => I've just asked him to go and check over the farm -
BEN => Are you thick?
TAMARA => What?
BEN => Isn't it obvious who sent it? That tosser Andy Cobb.
TAMARA => He wouldn't do that.
BEN => Making himself all cosy in your house. Going through your stuff, prob'ly wearing your fucking pants -
TAMARA => No way!
BEN => Bet it was him that nicked my black T-shirt.
TAMARA => There is no way Andy would do that! Ben pulls his jacket on.
BEN => Well that says it all; the way you leap to his defence.
TAMARA => He hasn't done anything.
BEN => You know what? I know Fran fucked my best friend but at least she was straight with me.
TAMARA => Ben - where are you going? Don't go!
BEN => Fuck's sake.
POPPY => Oh come on mum. She's just stirring shit. Tamara's always done that.
BETH => Why's your father on there - and poor Andy? It's so tasteless.
POPPY =>  You know how subversive she is. She once sent me a valentine from Prince Harry - and I believed it. It's her sense of humour; she likes causing trouble. At school she used to give us first years tips on how to shoplift.
BETH => She taught you to shoplift?
POPPY => Mum, she's marrying Ben Sergeant. Why would she look at an old git like dad? Nicholas is in the shadowy hall, listening with interest. Poppy helps Beth upstairs with the laundry. Nicholas steps into the kitchen. Poppy has left the email on the table. Nicholas picks it up, deeply curious.
NICHOLAS => What did you make of that email from Tamara?
ANDY => It don't make any sense. Her London boyfriend's trying to fuck her up; that's my theory. Andy carries on working.
ANDY => She could do so much better. Nicholas walks on.
CASEY => How come she's with a different bloke every week and when Lesley Hunt's sister shagged Jeff Dobson - just once, after he lied he loved her - she gets called a dirty slag.
JODY =>  That's cos she does it in five star resorts around the world - and not The Feathers carpark. Over the page, Ben canoodling in a freezing park with Fran.
JODY => It's Ben!
CASEY => `Who's the daddy? Steve Culley and Fran Redmond recently announced they were expecting. But in a Valentine tryst shocker Fran is snapped with ex Ben Sergeant! Ben and Fran - we say Get A Room.'
JODY => He's back with Fran? After...
CASEY => After that email, Jode.
JODY => No way. No way! Tamara's car zooms past. Her expression is black.
JODY => Omigod... what if she's dumped?
JODY => I'll never see Ben again... And it's all MY FAULT. Jody's mum comes into the room.
MUM => What's all your fault?
JODY =>  None of your business.
MUM => I'm bloody sick of you looking like a wet weekend. Who's Ben?
JODY => No one.
MUM => What've you done?
JODY => Nothing.
MUM => Are you in trouble?
JODY => NO!... Leave me alone.
MUM => You take care with boys, Jody. You know what can happen.
JODY => What can happen? What can ever, ever happen in a place like this? She throws herself on her duvet, inconsolable.
LUCETTA => Are they crows or jackdaws? It's so nice to get these little details right.
BETH => They're rooks.
LUCETTA => I've got an unhappy wife and a newly qualified vet discovering a forbidden world of physical love in a bird hide.
TAMARA => I'm looking for Andy.
NICHOLAS => He's not up at Stonefield. Tamara is about to turn back.
NICHOLAS => So what about this shag I've been reading about?
TAMARA => Oh fuck off.
NICHOLAS => I liked your email. Very succint.
TAMARA => Well I didn't send it. And I wouldn't shag you if you were the last man left after a nuclear winter.
NICHOLAS => I'll come round tomorrow then. About three?
TAMARA => Drop dead you smug prick. Nicholas watches her storm back up the copse.
Tamara turns. => She gets back in her car, trying to hide her distress - which has taken her completely by surprise. Jody and Casey stare mutely as she drives away.
ZOE => Still time to change your mind. Blue skies. Fun in the sun.
ANDY => Just not a traveller, Zoe.
NICHOLAS => I'll probably stay on at the library for another hour or two. Yes... just checking some law reports.
NICHOLAS => Hello.
TAMARA => So. Nicholas. She lets the door fall open. She backs into the hall. Nicholas walks in. He closes the door. They look at each other. Neither of them moves.
NICHOLAS => You can tell me to leave. Tamara says nothing.
NICHOLAS => You can throw me right out. Nicholas slowly takes his red scarf and coat off. He hangs them on a coat hook, bringing himself closer to her.
NICHOLAS => Just say and I'll go. She still can't speak. Nicholas takes her in his arms. He is big and fatherly and comforting. Tamara feels a sense of relief, of not being alone. Her arms go around him. When he kisses her, he's surprisingly real, vulnerable even, as if he's left his lordly persona at the door. Tamara closes her eyes. Their kisses become more urgent.
NICHOLAS => Are you crying?
TAMARA => No. Nicholas is taken aback. He instinctively holds her.
NICHOLAS => Don't cry. Am I really that bad? Tamara shakes her head, glad of him.
TAMARA => I'm just not myself.
NICHOLAS => Yes you are. She looks up at him.
NICHOLAS => You're relentlessly, rudely, uncompromisingly yourself. A smile appears on Tamara's face.
TAMARA => I used to watch you out of my window helping your daughter learn to skateboard up the lane. Bit of an obvious crush, wasn't it.
NICHOLAS => Is that why you're crying?
TAMARA => No.
NICHOLAS => Am I here as revenge on your ex?
TAMARA => I don't know why you're here. Why are you here, Nicholas?
NICHOLAS => Because... since you climbed over that stile in the summer I haven't thought about very much else. She doesn't believe him.
TAMARA => You can use me in one of your books.
NICHOLAS => When can we do this again?
TAMARA => What about Beth?
NICHOLAS => Look, Beth and I have this kind of
TAMARA => Bullshit.
NICHOLAS => Thursday?
TAMARA => Isn't life complicated enough? Nicholas shakes his head. He kisses her.
BETH => Oh poor you - was it awful?
NICHOLAS => Bloody terrible. Didn't move till well past Chiswick. But look, I nipped into Fortnums... He hands her a package.
BETH => All my favourite teas - Oh! He embraces her. He is affectionate, magnanimous in his bliss. Beth is taken aback by his warmth.
BETH => My goodness. You feel like my buzzy toothbrush just after I've charged it up. You should go up to London more often.
NICHOLAS => Maybe I will... Nicholas goes to the table. The writers greet him as he sits.
NICHOLAS => Sorry everybody; traffic was a pig. Do carry on...
LUCETTA => I'm trying this magic realist bit at the end of chapter three, where the characters slowly turn into
NICHOLAS => That sounds very innovative...
LUCETTA => Do you think so? It's sort of the key to the structure, which I'm thinking of as a nest shape...
GLEN => So after two years of radio silence I contact my editor. And she loves - I mean loves the chapters I did in the fall.
BETH => Oh Glen.
GLEN => I tried writing at the library but I could feel that awful paralysis descending again.
GLEN => I missed everything that I've been, you know, finding here.  Oh my god - it's so beautiful! They are now in the village driving down the main drag.
BETH => I'm glad you've come back.
GLEN => A few solid weeks should - holy cow! An egg hits the windscreen (shot the same way as the earlier scene). Casey and Jody hide. Beth gets out of the car to clean the window.
GLEN => Idiots! Morons! Hey, writers! Let's egg the self-regarding sacks of shit.
GLEN => There's this theory he gave his wife syphilis, right? No evidence but the symptoms fit. The poor woman gets kind of eccentric and moves her bed up to their attic -
BETH => The bastard -
GLEN => Meanwhile, Hardy falls in love with a woman who is thirty nine years younger than him.
BETH => I don't believe it. Nicholas is passing through, reading The Independent.
NICHOLAS => Geoff.
GLEN => Glen.
NICHOLAS => Henry James.
GLEN => Thomas Hardy.
NICHOLAS => That's right, a Hardy book. Coming well?
GLEN => Yes, actually. Nicholas returns to the paper.
BETH => He gave his wife syphilis.
NICHOLAS => Jolly good. He goes. Beth is ashamed of his condescension.
BETH => He's completely distracted. He's up and down to London all the time. The latest Inchcombe's taking everything he's got.
TAMARA => Is it any good? Because I keep -
NICHOLAS => Shush.  This is brutally candid. You lay yourself completely bare.
TAMARA => I'm well-known for it.
NICHOLAS => Seriously. It's very moving. Tamara knows this is praise indeed. She is deeply gratified.
TAMARA => Thank you.
NICHOLAS => So... have I done my duty?
TAMARA => Admirably.
NICHOLAS => Now do I get my treat? Tamara, almost in his arms, is crestfallen.
TAMARA => You are so cheesy. Tamara is staring at him with something akin to distaste.
JODY => Zero Ben sightings in two whole months.
CASEY => Last time I saw Plastic she looked like a minger; all red-eyed and gutted. Ben's a Love Rat.
CASEY => She should move on...
JODY => She's probably topped herself. I would if Ben dumped me.
CASEY => Jode. Don't say that. What if she's done something?
JODY => Like got in the bath with her heated tongs?
CASEY => Like taken a stack of pills? We see Jody's thought bubble of Tamara luridly dead, her mouth coated with dried froth and vomit.
JODY => D'you think she might be lying there all choked in vomit and drug froth?
CASEY => That'd be dire.
JODY => If we find her we'll get in the papers.
CASEY => Oh my God.
JODY => Rock Chick Dead at Winnards Farm.
CASEY => What's Uncle Andy doing here? Andy knocks.
NICHOLAS => Arse biscuits.
CASEY => No answer...
JODY => She could have been lying there days. She could be like putrid now, like rancid -
CASEY => Oh no, I'm gonna chuck -
JODY => Like bloated and all greeny.
CASEY => And Uncle Andy'll find her by the smell!
BOTH => Eurrrrr! Shhhhh!!
TAMARA => Andy... Behind the railings, the girls can't help their look of disappointment at seeing her alive.
JODY => Bollocks.
ANDY => Haven't seen you for a while. Thought you might be ill or something. Or depressed or -
TAMARA => I've had my head down, writing.
ANDY => Come for a drink. Let's lighten up.
TAMARA => I'd love to, but...
ANDY => Shake off the winter blues. Come celebrate the spring.
TAMARA => I can't... I'm kind of on one with my writing. Over her shoulder, Andy sees Nicholas' red scarf and coat hanging on the coat hook. He hides his shock. Tamara is unaware that he has seen.
TAMARA => Can we do it soon though? I'd really like to; just not right now. He nods at her in disbelief.
JODY => D'you think he's in with a chance?
CASEY => No way.
JODY => Why not? He's fit. I'd do him.
CASEY => Jody - he's my uncle.
JODY => She'd be mad not to have him - I bet he goes a like a train.
NICHOLAS => What's he doing here?
TAMARA => He just came on the off-chance.
NICHOLAS => Off-chance of what?
TAMARA => He wants to know about roofing for the shed...
JODY => Let's go. I'm freezing my tits off.
CASEY => Wait!! Casey is looking back at Tamara's door. Tamara is peering out. Nicholas joins her, putting his coat on. He kisses her passionately. He wants to stay. She's insisting he leaves.
JODY => Oh. My. God.
CASEY => It's him. From Stonefield.
JODY => The dirty cheating sod.
BETH => You fucking little slut. She puts her head in her hands.
CASEY => `Prolific author of intelligent crime novels.'
JODY => Fucking `D' list. How could she do that after Ben?
CASEY => Maybe she's numbing the pain.
JODY => He's not even a proper celeb.
CASEY => Maybe older guys know more... you know, bed stuff.
JODY => Eww! He's a perv. I hate him.
CASEY => Jode, I know who I feel sorry for.
BETH => Hello Casey. How are you? Jody nudges her. Casey nods. Beth posts her mail.
BETH => You waiting for the bus?
JODY => Bus got scrapped.
BETH => So it did. Well. Hope it doesn't rain. She turns for home.
CASEY => Gutted for her.
JODY => Me too. Fat arse though, hasn't she?
CASEY => There'll be the divorce and like acrimony and her world'll fall apart...
JODY => Yeah.
CASEY => But maybe one day, she'll put the bitterness behind her and find a new love...
JODY => Don't be daft. She's old, you big sop. A parked 4x4 looms out of the mist.
CASEY => See? That's D-List's car.
JODY => So this is where he hides it when he goes to shag Plastic.
CASEY => Yeah. Dirty git.
JODY => Big old turd.
CASEY => He's a rotten cheater.
JODY => Like my dad. Come on Case. Let's fuck him up.
NICHOLAS => Shit salad. He gets out his phone. Jody and Casey are in the trees watching, satisfied.
BETH => Oh poor you. What a drag.
NICHOLAS => Yes, it's a frightful bore.
BETH => Well I'll hold off on the paella. Tamara arrives, breathless. Nicholas signals her to keep quiet. She looks guilty, anxious.
NICHOLAS => You're a marvel. See you soon.
GLEN => Beth, could I use your printer?
BETH => Nicholas is on the motorway with a flat tyre. But I couldn't hear traffic. Just rooks...
BETH => Did you ask me to read something?
TAMARA => Nicholas, someone knows. Maybe we
NICHOLAS => Who cares? He kisses her, passionately. She is troubled but eventually responds. Jody nudges Casey.
JODY => Casey, pap them. Pap them! Casey holds out her mobile and takes a picture. Then Tamara extricates herself from his embrace. Jody peers at Casey's photo. A close-up clinch.
JODY => Fucking bingo.
preoccupied. => Jody appears from behind the hedge. She heads for the door, motioning Casey to follow.
CASEY => This is wrong, Jode.
JODY => She's asking for it; slut. I'm going to email D-List's wife.
CASEY => We should send the photo and be done with it.
JODY => Casey.
CASEY => What?
JODY => While I was sitting here. Look. An e-mail from Ben come in. Just like that, when I'm here.
BEN => And as it's a cute little brown girl with curly black hair I think we can safely say it's Steven Culley's and not mine. Truth is, I feel released. I am free! New band up and running. Done three songs about me and you. Ben throws a treat lovingly at Boss. Boss catches it.
BEN => Big favour to ask. We're recording in Paris. Would you have Boss?
JODY => `Could drop him off next week. And when I'm back, maybe we could dot dot dot. Ben.'
CASEY => He's coming back.
JODY => Tamara doesn't deserve him, Case.  `Dear Ben, I can't see you as I am shagging an old married man -
CASEY => What're you doing??
JODY => `But I have found a reliable dog- lover in the village...
CASEY => No way, Jody! You're not sending it.
JODY => `Call Jody on 07700 900929.' Casey tries to stop her pressing send. Jody digs her nails into Casey's hand. Casey yowls. Jody presses send.
CASEY => You stupid cow!
JODY => I'm making something happen!
CASEY => You gone too far!
JODY => I'm getting him down here.
CASEY => / You don't know when to stop! You're an idiot. I'm not having nothing to do with it. Jody shouts over her from /.
JODY => Otherwise my whole life'll go by and I'll be washed up and thirty four like my mum and no one decent will ever even have snogged me! Casey is leaving.
CASEY => You twat.
JODY => Fuck off then.
BETH => There's the festival brochure. You're on in the Lanson Marquee. I've marked a few bits in case you want to read. Beth hands him a hardback.
NICHOLAS => You're a marvel. Cheers. He kisses her and prepares to leave. She is suspicious.
BETH => I could come with you.
NICHOLAS => Oh, don't. You hate festivals.
BETH => But it's only Hadditon. I'll come.
NICHOLAS => It's completely boring. You'll hate it. Stay here. Her suspicion will stay silent no longer.
BETH => Have you got anything to tell me, Nicholas?
NICHOLAS => Like what? Nicholas attacks; the best form of defence.
NICHOLAS => God, it's like living with the effing moral police. Are you ever going to trust me? He goes.
CASEY =>  Right. Wanker.
BETH => I'm doing this cake in celebration. Well done. Glen holds up his mug of coffee.
GLEN => To Hardy.
GLEN => Well, things were different then. She had no choice. Beth's mobile bleeps. She picks it up.
GLEN => She couldn't just walk away. I mean who'd put up with that now? Beth drops the mixing bowl. She cannot speak.
GLEN => What is it?
BETH =>  How do I find out who sent this? Andy takes the phone, sees the photo.
ANDY => It says number withheld. He returns the phone.
BETH => Did you know? Andy nods guiltily. Beth acknowledges what this means.
ANDY => Couldn't tell you. I'm sorry Beth. He leaves.
BETH => Her... Glen looks at the photo; Nicholas and Tamara's clinch.
GLEN => Oh My God. This is just - this is horrible.
BETH => Right under my nose. I feel sick.
GLEN => It's so shitty, so insulting. You do not deserve to be treated -
BETH => If you're kind to me, I'll cry. I don't want to cry. I must be very clear.
GLEN => If there is anything I can do...
GLEN => Hey, come on.
BETH => I trod in the sponge mix.
GLEN => It's OK. It's OK.
TAMARA => Andy? Andy emerges. Tamara smiles tentatively.
TAMARA => Hey. How are you? Andy says nothing.
TAMARA => Would you like to have that drink? I could do with a friend / at the moment and -
ANDY => You and Nicholas Hardiment. That's a nice piece of work isn't it?
ANDY => I get it from his point of view. He's always been a cheating wanker. He loves having his cake and eating it - But since when did your standards drop so low? You could have anyone. All you have to do is bat your eyes.
ANDY => I care a lot about Beth. She helped me out when I was at rock bottom.
TAMARA => I'm not going to split them up. It's
TAMARA => It's none of your bloody business.
ANDY => I reckoned I could still see the blazing girl you used to be. But now?
TAMARA => Shut up!
ANDY => I don't know who you are. She turns away, her eyes stinging.
BEN => That Jody? This is Ben Sergeant.
JODY => That's right, yes... I love dogs.
BEN => So I'll meet you at Winnards Farm, four thirty. Ben zooms off.
JODY => It's a nice dog, Mum!
MUM => Well I don't like `em. Dog-hair and slobber all over the place.
JODY => But I said yes.
MUM => No dogs, no way and that's final. Jody is devastated.
JODY => You loser. I hate you. You want to
JODY => Live the dream, Jody...
TAMARA => Andy Cobb has rumbled us.
NICHOLAS => Cock pie. Has he told Beth?
TAMARA => I don't know. But he might. And I wouldn't blame him.
NICHOLAS => Well, I suppose it has to come out sometime.
TAMARA => Does it?
NICHOLAS => It's a good thing. Feels like a relief. Means you and I can start to think about our plans. For the future...
TAMARA => Nicholas?...
NICHOLAS => I know it's been hard, sharing me with Beth. But I'm yours now. I'm going to leave her. I want a new life - and I want it now. With you. Tamara is appalled. A minder interrupts.
MINDER => Mr Hardiment? It's time.
NICHOLAS => It all runs very smoothly. I start a book in the summer, publish it the following spring. Bit of a factory, really.
INTERVIEWER => So you've just finished `Like The Night', Inchcombe's seventeenth adventure. Are you already planning the next?
NICHOLAS => There won't be a next one. Frankly I'm sick to death of Inchcombe. In fact, I'm about to kill him off. There's a gust of dismay in the crowd, as though a real death has been announced.
INTERVIEWER => That's a bombshell for your fans.
NICHOLAS =>  Yes, but I'm moving on to fresh pastures.
NICHOLAS => Inchcombe will be meeting a very sticky end. And it's one murder I'm really looking forward to.
INTERVIEWER => This might be a good moment to take a few questions. Yes, the lady in the apron...
BETH => You write a lot about adultery. Is that from personal experience? Tamara turns round. Nicholas' colour drains. Beth is with Glen, close by - glaring at him. He tries to make a joke.
NICHOLAS => Madam, what a saucy question!
BETH => Why do you cheat persistently on your wife? Nicholas considers whether he wants to be publicly humiliated. He decides not.
NICHOLAS => Because she lets me. Beth takes this like a blow. Even Tamara is shocked by it.
TAMARA => It's got to stop, Nicholas.
NICHOLAS => You're right. I can't go on using her, lying to her. Won't be fun but I've got to do it.
NICHOLAS => I don't feel alive with Beth! I haven't been living for years. She's had me smothered in a comfy blanket -
TAMARA => Nicholas, listen to me. She makes him look at her.
TAMARA => We had fun. But it's wrong. And it's over.
NICHOLAS => But... I'm in love with you.
TAMARA => I'm sorry. Nicholas looks as if he's just been punched.
NICHOLAS => No. You can't end it. Tamara - Fuck supper!
TAMARA => Will you keep it down?
NICHOLAS => My God, you're cold hearted.
TAMARA => Please don't shout.
NICHOLAS => You don't feel a thing, do you?
TAMARA => I do feel. I feel like I'm blazing away inside all the time. Why do I do these things? What am I doing with you? The question hangs between them.
NICHOLAS => There's someone else isn't there...
TAMARA => Oh for God's sake.
NICHOLAS => Not that narcissist drummer?
TAMARA => Goodbye.
NICHOLAS => It's that ignorant lunk isn't it? That muscle-bound wastrel Andy Cobb.
TAMARA => Andy Cobb is a far better man than you! In saying it, Tamara realises it's true. She walks away. Nicholas bends almost double in pain, letting out a great moan from the soul. A fan has been waiting at a respectful distance. He approaches. Nicholas numbly takes his book. Instead of signing, he tears it to pieces. He hands the tatters back to the fan.
NICHOLAS => Thank you.
JODY => Hello? It's Jody Long. About the dog? She looks around.
JODY => Ben? She heads up the stairs.
BEN => Hello Jody... Jody spins round. The door closes. Ben is standing behind it. He is wearing a tight black T-shirt; the man of her dreams.
BEN => Dog minder? I guessed you might be the somebody who's been getting in here, pissing about, sending e-mails and fucking people up. D'you know what I'm saying? You've been breaking in.
JODY => I didn't break in. Used the key.
BEN => What key?
JODY => Found it under a pot.
BEN => Well for fuck's sake. Did you nick my T-shirt?
JODY => Took it as a souvenir. I'm sorry! Jody is very scared. She is crying.
BEN => Creeping about in our stuff? What gives you the right?
JODY => I just... like I always wanted to meet you...just once...just to tell you stuff...
BEN => What stuff?
JODY => Like... I love you.
BEN => So that's nice. Least someone does.
JODY => I used to lie awake thinking about you being here... in Ewedown, the bumhole of nowhere. It was the best thing to happen ever. I've been so in love with you. And when you left I couldn't bear it. I thought the valentine would make you come back...
BEN => D'you still love me, Jody? Even though I wanna lock you up in a young offenders institution? Jody nods, unsure.
BEN => What would you do for me then? Would you do anything, like a proper fan? Jody looks at him, scared. She manages a nod. Ben approaches her.
BEN => Let's see then shall we? We see Jody's phone flashing on the bed.
CASEY => Jody! What are you doing not fucking answering?
CASEY => Ben's dog. It's here. Means Ben must be - Casey suddenly realises where Jody is. The dog runs off up the street. Casey sets off towards Winnards, full of apprehension.
BETH => I bet that bitch wants a baby. Well she'll find out; Nicholas doesn't do children.
BETH => He'll leave it all up to her. That'll age her.
BETH => But suppose he discovers fatherhood?
BETH => They do, these men, second time round. They get all nappy-happy. I was barely twenty when I got pregnant. I've never done anything! Oh God! God!
GLEN => Yes you have. Look at this place!
BETH => I hate him - I've wasted my life!
GLEN => No... What about all the work you do here?
BETH => Breeding goats? Baking fucking biscuits? It's meaningless! Beth bawls. Glen holds her.
GLEN => Beth... When I was lost with my book you helped me more than you know. You asked who I was writing it for... He starts to really hold her. The sobbing subsides.
GLEN => You. He kisses her. Beth looks at Glen; a revelation. The future opens up. She kisses him back.
NICHOLAS => Excuse me. Nicholas is standing in the doorway, looking grey.
NICHOLAS => May I speak with my wife? Glen releases Beth.
BETH => No. You may not. She walks away.
NICHOLAS => It's over.
BETH => That's Ben Sergeant's dog. Perhaps he's come to beat the shit out of you - good!
NICHOLAS => Beth - I finished it. She's been chasing me; this wild crush -
NICHOLAS => There's something desperate about her, something almost unhinged -
BETH => Good God, even when you try and tell the truth you lie. YOU LIE!! Nicholas is falling apart.
BETH => I want you to leave. I want a divorce. I want Stonefield.
NICHOLAS => Beth...Don't. You can't.
BETH => I will.
TAMARA => Ben...
BEN => Right. Now put two sugars in and stir it. OK. That's a decent cup. Which is lucky Jody cos if it had been shit, I'd be on the phone to the extremely scary local cops right now.
JODY => Please don't tell my mum.
BEN => I knew it was boring round here but for fuck's sake...
JODY => I'm gonna get out as soon as I can. Going to work in Vegas - as a croupier. Vegas, or a cruise liner.
BEN => Aim high, that's what I say.
TAMARA => Ben?
BEN => Tamara. You've had an infestation.
BEN => Jody. Jody, shamefaced, prepares to cough up.
NICHOLAS => Oy! Greg! I want a a word with you.
GLEN => It's Glen, asshole. Nicholas is stomping through the mud and cowshit.
NICHOLAS => You fucking devious bastard.
GLEN => I'm devious? I'm a bastard?
NICHOLAS => You think I haven't noticed how you've been worming your way in? You keep your hands off my wife, you low-rent pedant.
GLEN => You've abused her long enough / with your goddamn lies -
NICHOLAS => I want you out of my house.
GLEN => It's Beth's. She made this place -
NICHOLAS => And I fucking pay for it. I've given Beth all this. What can you give her?
GLE => I can give her / integrity!
NICHOLAS => Obscure literary shit not worth ten
GLEN => You know if I made my pile fantasizing rapes and homicides I wouldn't be so proud.
GLEN => Fuck you. Glen grabs him round the middle. They struggle like overgrown schoolboys.
NICHOLAS => Beth'll come to her senses. You need an income to run Stonefield. And mine's bigger than yours! Glen nuts him. Nicholas slips backwards in the mud. He whacks his skull on the sharp, rusting corner of the trough. He falls to the ground. Glen is astonished at his own prowess.
GLEN => Now... get up, Nicholas. Let's talk about this like grown men. Blood trickles from the wound on Nicholas' head. He moans.
GLEN => Oh my God. Nicholas... Glen becomes aware of a sound like a drumbeat, the drumming of hooves. The herd of cows come over the brow of the hill and down towards them. Boss is chasing them, barking. The beasts are terrified, stampeding.
GLEN => Nicholas! Get up! Run! Glen puts out a hand to help him. But before Nicholas notices, he instinctively retrieves it. Glen turns on his heels and runs, terrified. He throws himself into the hedge as the cows thunder past. They disappear down the hill, Boss still behind them. Glen looks back towards the water trough. Nicholas is lying on his front, his face pressed into the mud, unmoving. Glen walks over. He gingerly peers at him. The back of Nicholas' skull is broken open. Blood is pooling in the mud and shit. Glen panics. He looks all around. Has the accident been seen? No human is visible. Has his part in it been noticed? He bends down as if to turn the body over, in case by some miracle Nicholas still lives. He cannot bring himself to touch him. Fear overwhelms him. He runs away.
TAMARA => It was you? Jody can't look her in the eye.
BEN => Jody has explained that she did it out of deep love for me. To Ben's astonishment, Tamara smiles. He grabs his moment.
BEN => Tamara... It's an apology. Tamara takes Ben's hand and leads him through to a dresser in the hall. She opens it.
TAMARA => Ben. She takes the ring out of the jar and puts it in his hand.
TAMARA => I'm in love with someone else. At that moment, Casey appears at the back door.
CASEY => Jody - the dog!
PENNY => Got `im. The beast.
BETH => Bitch. Tamara looks up.
TAMARA => Beth - no -
BETH => Brazen. That is brazen. Beth carries on walking towards her.
TAMARA => Beth. Don't. Tamara is running towards Beth. She cannot bear her to see. She throws her arms around her, protecting her.
TAMARA => Don't look. Don't look... It is too late. Beth is seeing the corpse. A great wave of shock hits her. Tamara holds her tight, trying to contain it. Another great wave of shock.
BETH => Nicholas. No. Her cries of grief soar over the valley.
TAMARA => You'll get to it through Byley farm. His skull is broken. It's smashed. No I haven't but... it's obvious. His wife. Yes she is. Thank you. Thank you. I will. Beth has turned Nicholas over. She is washing the mud from his face with water from the trough.
TAMARA => They're on their way... Beth seems totally closed off. Tamara gingerly approaches. She touches Beth's shoulder.
TAMARA => Beth? Help is coming - Beth cannot bear to be touched. Her hand involuntarily flies out. It slams into Tamara's face. Tamara steps back. Her nose is broken, pouring blood.
TAMARA => It's broken! - She gasps, riding the pain, knowing she deserves it. It's the biggest wake-up call of her life. Beth stares at her, at first astonished at what she has done - then satisfied. Tamara stumbles away.
ANDY => Tamara... Andy is watching. She turns away from him. He approaches.
TAMARA => I'm sorry. She starts crying bitter tears.
ANDY => Tam, come on. It was an accident. Still Tamara cries. He comforts her. She lets him. He holds her for some time.
ANDY => I'd better get up to Stonefield. Come with me. We'll get this sorted.
ANDY => Then get Ben to take you to London. Make sure he looks after you. Tamara walks a few paces away. She stares straight ahead.
TAMARA => I don't want to be with Ben. She looks back at Andy. He begins to understand. She walks off.
JODY => Pap me! Pap me! Casey waits until Ben is not looking. Then she takes pictures with her mobile phone. Jody cradles Ben in her arms, doing her best moved-but-sultry pose. Casey tries not to laugh. Jody is ecstatic. The man of her dreams is in her arms. Her wish has come true.
ANDY => What are you doing? Glen can't look him in the eye.
GLEN => I figured I'd best, you know, take myself off. She doesn't want writers around the place now. And police, autopsies, not my thing -
ANDY => You can't run away.
GLEN => I'm not running away! I just finished my book; my time here is up. Destiny calls.
ANDY => Beth is asking for you.
GLEN => She's... Really?
ANDY => She's on her own over there. Glen, she doesn't need a writer around the place. She needs a man.
GLEN => I'm so sorry. Beth looks up at him despairingly.
GLEN => Do they... suspect anyone? I mean of like Foul Play?
BETH => It was my fault. I let the dog go!
GLEN => No, no...
BETH => I shooed him away! The police said it was an accident but...
GLEN => It wasn't your fault!
BETH => What I don't understand is why was he in that field anyway? He hated cows. And when they were coming, why didn't he get out of their way?
GLEN => Beth. I have to tell you...
GLEN => You live in the country. You share it with those dangerous beasts. And when they're scared, they run. Like we do... Glen is full of horror at his lie. But Beth is only grateful.
BETH => Glen. Stay with me. Her eyes, still red with grief, are full of their future together. Glen nods. He will stay. He wants it all. Beth leans into him, seeking comfort. He puts his arms around her, his face ashen with the weight of his secret. As he holds her, he looks around the room. Nicholas is everywhere, glaring down at him from photographs.
TAMARA => Don't say anything.
ANDY => Kind of suits you. And I always did like the old one. They are in each others arms. The embrace lasts and lasts. Tamara is leading Andy up to the house.
TAMARA => You did it on purpose, didn't you?
ANDY => What?
TAMARA => Made it so beautiful I'd never be able to leave.
ANDY => Been dying to get rid of you. This is my house. I was born in that room.
TAMARA => So you were. They are at the threshold. They kiss.
TAMARA => Welcome home.
