MR AARON => Abrams... Allende... One after the other the students get up to collect their tests, glance at the results and drag themselves back to their chairs. On LISA COHEN, just 17. Not the best-looking girl in her class but definitely in the top five. She listens listlessly, somewhat bad-temperedly.
MR AARON => Bernstein... Cohen... At "Cohen" LISA gets up and heads for the desk. LISA'S POV, closing in slowly on MR AARON who glances up at her as she approaches. Their eyes meet. Aaron has the classic handsome young teacher's no-nonsense expression on his face as she reaches out her hand --
LISA => Thank you, Mr Aaron. She walks back. On her test he's written: B- "SEE ME1"
MR AARON => Take a seat, Lisa. I just wanna talk about your test for a minute.
MR AARON => Now...I know you had a little help...
LISA => Well -- I mean -- I didn't cheat, if that's what you mean.
MR AARON => I'm just saying I know you had a little help.
LISA => A lot of people did.
MR AARON => Be that as it may --
LISA => I mean I'll take it over again if you want, but like, what would be the point? It's not like I'm ever gonna actually need to know this stuff in my daily life...
MR AARON => Well, Lisa, that's just not necessarily true. Haven't you ever developed an interest in something you didn't initially think you were going to develop an interest in?
LISA => Um, no, not really.
LISA => Anyway, it was open book. So what's the big difference-between using a book and like, I don't know, using somebody else's mind who's like, really good at math? It's not like this person did the whole test for me.
MR AARON => Oh no?
LISA => No. I did some of it. She smiles at him. He is no longer smiling back.
MR AARON => Well, next time I'd appreciate it if you did all of it. OK?
LISA => You are so fair.
BECKY => What did he say to you?
LISA => Nothing. . .Mr Aaron and I have an understanding about my math problem. Becky laughs. Lisa laughs.
LISA => He is so appealing. A long-haired kid comes out, followed by a somewhat preppier girl, KIRSTEN, and her look-alike friend LESLIE.
KIRSTEN => OK, Mr Ferrar is such an asshole.
KURT => What'd he do, call on you?
KIRSTEN => Fuck you., Kurt.
LESLIE => Kirsten is really upset.
KURT => I'm sorry.
BECKY => Kirsten, I didn't know you smoked.
KIRSTEN => I don't. -I'm just really angry. Check out what he. said to me last week. She drops her voice. They whisper and then both laugh. Lisa watches them.
LESLIE => Are you serious? Lisa overhears MONICA, an elegant 12th-grader, talking to some other girls seated on the steps.
MONICA => .I just don't think you can really know a guy until you've slept with him. Lisa, listening, is not so sure, but wouldn't know.
KLEIN => .So the President of the United States, William B. McKinley, authorized the use of private detectives to break the strike, and they went out there and shot them down! Just like they did in Virginia, just like they did in Pennsylvania. Because they did not care! They did not care!
LEWIS =>  And that's basically it-That's basically all there is to say.
KLEIN => All right? Go ahead, uhhhhh: Becky.
BECKY => Well, Mr Klein...I mean, was there ever a good President of the United States? There is some laughter from the students.
KLEIN => I don't know, Becky. I think that's a good question. What do you think? You. Lionel. What do you think? Did we ever have a good President?
LIONEL => Um...I don't know. I guess most of them have just been totally corrupt.
- LEWIS => Lisa?
LISA => Can I just say, I'm not necessarily like a big fan of all the Presidents of the United States, especially the current one, but I still don't think its necessarily all that useful to categorize every President as universally corrupt, because that just seems very general to me. Especially if you're going to judge them by the standard of -- whatever they're supposed to traditionally be like in some mythical version of America that probably never existed to begin with. ANTHONY, an intellectual smart-ass, leans back in his chair.
ANTHONY => Lisa has raised a salient point. There are some laughs from the class.
DARREN => Hey, how'd you do?
LISA => Oh hey Darren. It was fine. Thank you so much.
DARREN => So he didn't give you a hard time or anything?
LISA => Well, he knows I'm not planning to like, go into Mathematics or anything...He was totally cool about it. He's so cool.
DARREN => Oh yeah, everybody loves Mr Aaron.
LISA => What's that supposed to mean?
DARREN => Nothing. The man is very lovable. They stop at the corner.
- DARREN => What are you doing now?
LISA => I was gonna go look for a cowboy hat.
DARREN => Why would you want to buy a cowboy hat?
LISA => Because my Dad is supposed to take me and my brother to this ranch in New Mexico to go horseback riding, and I don't think it would be right to appear on horseback in New Mexico without the appropriate equestrian paraphernalia, Darren. You wouldn't understand these things.
DARREN => That is a definite possibility.
LISA => Anyway... Thanks again...
DARREN => Before you venture forth on your bizarre quest for a cowboy hat...?
LISA => Yes, Darren?
DARREN => .what are you up to later? Like tonight.
LISA => I don't know.
DARREN => You wanna go to a movie?
LISA => What do you mean, like on a date?
DARREN => No, not on a date, just go to amovie. I don't know if it's a fucking date!
LISA => All right. Calm down. What do you wanna see?
DARREN => I don't know, I don't even know what's playing! I don't know if it's a date! Let's just forget it! I hate the fuckin' movies anyway. They're just bullshit.
LISA => OK, take it easy, I was just asking! I'm sorry!
DARREN => What if it was a date, anyway? Would that
LISA => Oh my God. Are you like -- are you asking me out?  Hello...? Earth to Darren.
DARREN => I don't know. Yeah. I mean...I feel like we're already really close...
LISA => Oh my God...
DARREN => .and I think we'd be a really good match - - What?
LISA => Nothing. This is -- Nothing.
DARREN => So -- Yeah. I would. I mean, yes. I am.
LISA => Wow. I mean -- I am really flattered. But I would definitely not want to do anything to mess up our friendship.
DARREN => I view this as a way of strengthening our friendship.
LISA => It would definitely change it...
DARREN => I know: It's a fairly dangerous move.
LISA => Well...I would definitely have to think about this...
DARREN => Absolutely. Give it some thought.
LISA => OK, I will. Pause. He is looking at her like he wants something.
LISA => Why do you look like that?
DARREN => Like what?
LISA => What do you want from me?
DARREN => Not a thing!
LISA => All right. I'll see you later.
DARREN => All right. She turns and walks away, pleased by the conversation.
LISA => Hello...! Lisa drops her bag-and goes into the kitchen. She opens the refrigerator. Her brother CURTIS, 11, comes in.
CURTIS => Hi.
LISA => Is Mom home?
CURTIS => She went to the store. Lisa gets out some cold pizza and sits down with it.
CURTIS => Use a plate.
LISA => Don't be such a little fuckin' goody two- shoes. -
CURTIS => Fuck you.
LISA => Please don't say "fuck," Curtis.
CURTIS => You just said it.
LISA => Yeah, that's because I know what it means.
CURTIS => So do I.
LISA => Uh, no you don't, Curtis. Take my word for it.
CURTIS => What does it mean? She looks at him and speaks very slowly and deliberately.
LISA => It's when a man puts his penis inside a woman's vagina and moves it around really fast until they both have an orgasm and he ejaculates sperm inside her body. Pause.
CURTIS => No it's not.
LISA => Yes it is.
CURTIS => Gross.
CURTIS => Do you want to play a game?
LISA => No.
CURTIS => Please!
LISA => I don't feel like it, Curtis. Quit bugging me.
CURTIS => Can I have some pizza? She gives him a piece of pizza. He sits. They eat together.
LISA =>  What are you up to tonight? . Nothing: Darren wants me to go to the movies with him. You want to come? I guess around eight?
LISA => Hey! Where'd you get your cowboy hat? IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver can't hear her, but smiles at her with good-natured flirtatiousness. ON THE STREET -- The LIGHT at the curb turns YELLOW. THE SLOW-MOVING CAR in front of the bus floors it to make the light. THE BUS DRIVER sees his way is clear and steps on the gas. He turns and waves goodbye to Lisa. She points at her head and then at him. He smiles, not quite getting it. The LIGHT turns RED. Still looking at Lisa, the BUS DRIVER lifts the hat off his head in a farewell salute as.-- LISA sees the bus pass under the RED LIGHT --
VERY FAST => THE BUS DRIVER turns his head to look straight forward. POV BUS DRIVER -- Monica is directly in front of him. POV MONICA -- The bus roars up at her. THE BUS DRIVER slams on the BRAKES. POV LISA -- Monica is clipped by the huge bus and pulled tumbling underneath. LISA SCREAMS. Pedestrians all over turn around. MONICA is pulled and crunched in a horrible twisting tumble. Everything stops. TRACKING LISA fast as she runs across the street toward the accident. As she gets closer she sees Monica's leg sticking out from under the bus. Then with some confusion, she realizes that Monica herself is right in front of her, and that her blood is spreading everywhere. Monica is reaching out vaguely, unable to speak. She is making choking sounds. Lisa stands over her for a second, frozen. She crouches down and tries to do something but doesn't know what to do, where to put her hands. Other people start converging. IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver puts the bus in Park, opens the door and rushes out. WE TRACK him as he comes around to where a crowd has already formed. He hangs back on the outside, but we break through till we find LISA kneeling next to the disoriented MONICA, holding her hand. They are both covered in blood. Several other people are shouting and talking all at once.
1ST MAN => Somebody call an ambulance! Call an ambulance! Everyone calm down!
KID => I'm calling one right now...! The Kid is already dialing his cell phone. Other people are doing the same.
2ND MAN => Get an ambulance!
1ST MAN => Someone's calling one!
LISA => Ma'am, can you hear me? Can you hear me?
MONICA => I don't know. Where am I? What is going on?
2ND MAN => Never mind, let her talk!
MONICA => Who are you?
LISA => My name is Lisa.
MONICA => Am I dead?
LISA => No, you're not dead. You were in a traffic accident, but you're gonna be OK --
MONICA => What do you mean? What happened?
LISA => You were run over by a bus.
MONICA => You've got to be kidding me. A bus?
2ND MAN => LISA Is there a doctor anywhere?
1ST MAN => Here, lemme try to see if I can -- He tries to detach Lisa's hand from Monica's.
MONICA => NO! Don't let go of me!
2ND MAN => Oh my God!
MONICA => Oh my God what's happening to me!
2ND MAN => We need to get a tourniquet MONICA on you.  Do you . Thank you, honey. Just don't have a belt? You can use let go of me. your belt.
MONICA => What do you mean? Are they doctors? Who are they?
MONICA => Well, get 'em the fuck away from me!
1ST MAN => Ma'am, we're only trying to help you!
2ND MAN => Never mind that! Try it higher up. Try to put it higher up!
1ST MAN => You wanna do it? You know what to do. Why don't you do it?
LISA =>  Are you kidding me!
MONICA => I can't see anything. Are my eyes open or closed? This silences everyone. Lisa looks at the 1st Man. He shakes his head, panicked; he doesn't know what to say.
LISA => They're open.
MONICA =>  What do you mean?
2ND MAN => Just put it higher up! Just move it -
KID => Try putting it higher up!
1ST MAN => There's nowhere to put it! I can't even -- Lisa looks at the incredible amount of blood still spreading everywhere, all over her, all over the street.
LISA => KID Well they're obviously I called them two minutes not coming fast enough ago, and somebody else so maybe you should probably called them too! call them again! Why not call them again!
MONICA => Could somebody call my daughter?
LISA => Sure! We can call her. What's her name?
KID => You want my phone?
1ST MAN => OK, OK, hold on.
KID => I got a cell phone, you want me to call her?
LISA => It's -- No -- that's my name. Is that your daughter's name?
MONICA => What? What are you talking about?
LISA =>  I'm s -- I'm not trying to be confusing. My name is Lisa: Is that your daughter's name?
MONICA => Jesus Christ, would you call her? Just call her!
1ST MAN => I got it. I got it!
LISA => I can't call her if you don't give me the number --
2ND MAN => Ma'am? You're gonna be OK.
KID => You're gonna be OK!
LISA => What's your daughter's number? Monica starts breathing a horrible rattling choking.
MONICA => Oh sweetie, I don't think I'm gonna make it.
LISA => Oh no please hang on. The ambulance is gonna be here any minute! Monica dies.
LISA => Oh please hang on! Please hang on!
1ST MAN => OK. It's OK. She's gone. The 1st Man tries to pull her away.
LISA => NO ! Let GO. of me !
MITCHELL => OK, Lisa? Lisa? I just want to ask you a couple of questions, OK?
LISA => OK, sure.
MITCHELL => Now I want to ask you where you-were, and what you saw when the accident took place. Just tell me everything you saw, even if you think it might not be important. OK? Think of it like a movie. Like you're watchin' a movie in your head, and all you gotta do is tell me exactly what you see in the movie. OK?
LISA => Yes. Thank you for the -- yes.
-MITCHELL => OK? So, where were you, on the corner? Standing by the corner? Were you in the crosswalk -- ?
LISA =>  No, I wasn't on the corner. I mean I was, but I was running. I was trying to catch the bus.
MITCHELL => OK, so you're on the corner? Northwest corner?
LISA => If that's what corner it is.
MITCHELL => So, you're standing across the street. Northwest corner.
LISA => Yes, except I wasn't standing I was running.
MITCHELL => So the bus goes by and you start running.
LISA => No! I was already running! I was trying to catch the bus and I happened to pass the corner! I wasn't standing on the corner!
MITCHELL => Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Slow down a sec. So you're tryin' to catch the bus --
LISA =>  Yes! Yes! I was trying to catch the bus! I was trying to catch the bus!
MITCHELL => I'm sorry Lisa, but we gotta ask you this while it's still fresh in your mind. I know this is hard for you. I'm just tryin' to do my job, OK?
LISA => I understand! I don't mind, I'm just upset!
MITCHELL => OK, Lisa, hang in there. You're doin' great.
LISA => Could somebody call my mother?
MITCHELL => We already called your Mom; but I'm gonna have 'em put another call into your mother right now, OK?
LISA => Yes. Please stop patronizing me.
MITCHELL => I'm not tryin' to patronize you. I'm just tryin' to get the information down while
LISA => They do make sense. Just ask me!
MITCHELL => Well, that's what I'm doin'. Now: I'm gonna ask you: From where you're standing could you see the traffic light?  Could you see if it was red? Green? Yellow? Just picture it in your mind. What color was the light? Lisa looks over at the Bus Driver. He looks back at her.
LISA => I guess it was green? I didn't really see it. I think it was just an accident.
YOUNG COP => You go to school around here?
LISA => Yes.
YOUNG COP => What's that a private school?
LISA => Yes.
LISA => I don't know.
YOUNG COP => You don't know what you're studyin'?
LISA => American history!
CURTIS => What happened to you?
LISA => Nothing: I saw a woman get her leg cut off by a bus. She goes down the hall and into her room. JOAN, her mother, 40s, appears from the kitchen.
JOAN => Hello?
LISA => Good one, Lisa. She starts breathing heavily. She goes into her bathroom --
JOAN => Lisa?
LISA => Just a second...! Joan comes into the bathroom.
LISA => Just a second! She throws up again.
JOAN => Oh my God, what happened to you?!?
- LISA => It's OK, Mom, it's not my blood...!
JOAN => What do you mean? Whose blood is it? What, happened?!
NOTHING! => Joan kneels down and tries to help her. Lisa screams and puts her arms around her mother and cries.
JOAN => I don't know if I'm going to be able to get these clean again.
LISA => Just throw them out.
JOAN => Let me see if I can get them clean.
JOAN => Does anybody know who she was?
LISA => I don't know. I guess she lived around here. She had all these Fairway grocery bags.
CURTIS => What did they do with her leg?
LISA => I have no fucking idea.
JOAN => Hey. Come on...
JOAN => Lisa? Are you sure you don't want me to call in...?
LISA => Oh, no thanks Mom. I mean thank you: That's really sweet. But I'm supposed to go see Becky anyway.
LISA => I don't really want to sit here thinking about it all night. Go to work. I'll be alright. Joan doesn't look so sure.
LISA => Hey.
BECKY => Hey, Darren.
-DARREN => Hey.
LISA => Did you get the tickets?
STAGEHAND => Joan? You got some flowers.
JOAN => Can you bring 'em in?
JOAN => Thank you guys so much for coming...! It was really great to see you...!
JOAN => Hi -- are you Ramon?
RAMON => Yes. Hello. You were wonderful -- again.
JOAN => You're so sweet, thank you. And thank you for the beautiful flowers...!
RAMON => Oh you're very welcome. I hope you didn't mind...
JOAN => No, I'm very flattered. And you've seen the show before...?
RAMON => Yes, two times.
JOAN => Gosh. That's very -- That's a lot!
RAMON => Oh no. It's a beautiful performance. And I think it's still in previews...?
JOAN => Yeah, we're on kind of a weird schedule...
RAMON => I think you will have a big success.
JOAN => Well, at the moment we're just trying to focus on what we're doing...
RAMON => I don't know if you are busy, but will you allow me to -buy you a drink? There's a place right down the street... If you like to ask your friends... or if you didn't eat dinner... Joan sees Lisa sitting across the room waiting.
JOAN => Oh -- No -- thank you. I can't. I'm just on my way home.
RAMON => OK, it's no problem. Tomorrow I'm going to London for a few days on business. Perhaps when I come back...
JOAN => Um -- Well --
RAMON => If it's not convenient, it's no problem.
JOAN => Anyway, thank you so much for the flowers!
RAMON => It's a privilege to meet you.
JOAN => I thought you were at the movies...!
LISA => Yeah... It wasn't very good. Who's that?
JOAN => I don't know. He sent me flowers.
LISA => Go out with him.
JOAN => You think?
LISA => Um, yeah...! Ramon disappears up the stairs. Joan and Lisa look at each other.
JOAN => Hi, sweetie... !
LISA => She kisses and hugs Lisa, squashing her a little. Lisa gets a little tearful. Joan squeezes her tighter.
LISA => 'Bye Mom.
JOAN => I love you.
LISA => I love you too. Lisa goes out. We stay with Joan, who looks fretful.
JOHN => Matthew, if you would read France... And Anthony, you read Burgundy...
ANTHONY =>  Ah. Burgundy.
JOHN => And I guess I'm gonna hog the part of Lear again...
ANTHONY => "Most royal majesty, I crave no more than hath your highness Offer'd, nor will you tender less."
JOHN => "Right, noble Burgundy, When she was dear to us, we did hold her so; But now her price is fall'n."
DARREN => If you didn't want to go to the movies alone with-me Friday, you could have just told me that. You didn't need to bring Becky along as your bodyguard.
LISA => I didn't bring her as a bodyguard.
DARREN => Then why did you?
DARREN => NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2 What relationship? You don't say.
LISA => NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 What are you muttering? Oh that whole family's crazy.
DARREN => NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2 Nothing. I'll try to Fourteen years! improve my diction. What's the matter?
DARREN => NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 Like what? Who's gonna steal him?
LISA => NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 Just everything. That's what I said.
DARREN => NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2 But what specifically is What's the name of it? fucked up? NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 LISA It's called a bull terrier. Nothing.
LISA =>  So...I've been thinking about your suggestion...
DARREN => Uh huh...?
LISA => I guess I_don't think it's a very good idea.
DARREN => Why not?
LISA => I guess I don't feel that way about you.
DARREN => But those kinds of feelings can develop. I definitely feel like there's a connection there.
DARREN => I just think you're scared. I'think you're scared of your own feelings. I think you've been hurt in the past by other guys and I think what it would feel like to have a real feeling is really terrifying to you.
DARREN => What's the matter?  What's the matter?
RAMON => My family are from Colombia... My.father worked in the diplomatic service...
JOAN => Really. Wow.
RAMON => I grew up five years in Panama, four years in Holland, then nine years in Paris. After I finish university, I moved back to Colombia. So: when I'm speaking French, they think I'm Spanish. When I'm speaking Spanish, they think I'm french.
JOAN => And what do you do, Ramon?
RAMON => I have a company: We design computer software to help companies in South American countries.that use an incompatible software, so the computers can't talk to each other. It's a big problem in Central and South America, where there is not usually so much coordination in computer communications. So right now there's a big opportunity for us, because for the big software companies it's still in the backwoods. That's changing already, but in the last ten years we have done extremely well. It's the next ten years we're going to see what happens.
JOAN => Uh huh? God...
RAMON => Can I give you a lift?
JOAN => Oh -- no -- Thank you, I'm just gonna grab a cab, but thank you.
RAMON => May I call you sometime?
JOAN => OK, sure, that would be great. Pause.
RAMON => May I have your telephone number?
JOAN => Oh my God, I'm sorry, of course. Duh! Hold on a minute: Do you have a pen? Ramon takes out his cell phone.
RAMON => What's the number?
JOAN => Um -- 212...
LISA => Mom...?
LISA =>  Can I come in?
JOAN => Just one second, honey. Hold on! (covering herself up) Come in. Lisa comes in and sits on the edge of the bed.
LISA => Can I talk to you?
JOAN => Sure. What's up.
LISA => How was the show...?
JOAN => It was OK. Are you all right?
LISA => Not really.
JOAN => What's wrong?
LISA => Mom...I have to tell you something.
LISA => So what do you think I should do?
JOAN => Well...it doesn't sound like it was anybody's fault...
LISA => But don't you think I should say something to them now?
JOAN => I don't know, sweetie. I mean, that bus driver probably has a family to support .He could probably lose his job...So I think you should really think about that before you say anything ... You might end up feeling even worse... Lisa was not expecting this response and doesn't like it.
OK... => Joan isn't sure what she's done wrong.
KLEIN => Think of the implications of what you're saying!
KLEIN => .I'm saying what is the frame of reference for the average Arab on the street? Angie!
ANGIE => Yeah, my family is from Syria? And I just want to say that Americans have no idea how much people hate them all over the world. OK?
BECKY => We don't?
ANGIE => And all my relatives in Syria think that what we did in Afghanistan was terrorism. Not to mention Iraq...
ANTHONY => Syria is a theocratic military dictatorship.
ANGIE => Um, no it's not: Sorry.
ANTHONY => Syria is not a theocratic military dictatorship?
LISA => Um, I think we have a pretty good idea how much people hate us now actually, Angie.
ANGIE => No we don't.
LEWIS => One at a time --
LISA => They blew up our city, OK? So yeah, I think we have a pretty good idea, and personally I don't give a shit. There is some laughter from the class.
ANGIE => You should!
LISA => -- because the people who blew up the World Trade Center were a bunch of sick monsters -
ANGIE => Oh they were monsters?
LISA => Yes!
ANGIE => Why? Because they're Arabs?
LISA => No, because they killed three thousand people for no reason.
KLEIN => Hey, hey, one at a time...!
ANGIE => Maybe they think they had a reason!
KLEIN => LISA Hey, hey, hey! Like what? They didn't even have any demands! ANGIE They just wanted to kill Why did we drop bombs people! on innocent people in Afghanistan? We're still What do you think we doing it! Why did we should've have done? invade Iraq? THE CLASS BECKY They don't care about Because, they declared war civilian casualties! And on us, Angie! Iraq has nothing to do with Afghanistan! It has to do with ANGIE oil! No they didn't! Iraq didn't declare war on LEWIS anybody! They didn't co Come on guys, one at a time! anything to us! Anthony.
ANTHONY => They did have a reason.
ANGIE => Thank you.
ANTHONY => They want to establish a medieval Islamic caliphat in the Middle East and destroy Western civilization.
ANTHONY => It's on their website.
ANGIE => Okay, forget it.
KLEIN => Angie!
ANGIE => No! Forget it!
KLEIN => Go ahead with what you were saying!
ANGIE => No! Why should I?
LISA => But why are you defending somebody who murdered three thousand people!
ANGIE => I'm not! Why are you defending a country that unilaterally invaded two Muslim countries and supports the Israeli occupation of Palestine?! The class ROARS.
LISA => Oh give me a break!
ANGIE => -- and drops bombs on women and children and then calls other people terrorists for doing the exact same thing!
KLEIN LISA => OK -- OK -- Because it's not same thing!
ANGIE => Yes it is!
KLEIN => Lionel! Go ahead.
LIONEL => Yeah, I just want to ask like, why is OK to drop bombs on men, but it's not OK to drop bombs on women and children? Isn't that just reverse sexism?
KLEIN => I don't know. That's an interesting point. I agree it's a bullshit term.
LISA => This is totally stupid.
KLEIN =>  Uhhhhhh...Monica!
MONICA => Yeah, I think this whole class should apologize to Angie, because all she did was express her opinion about what her relatives in Syria think about the fact that we bombed the shit out of a practically medieval culture --
ANGIE => Thank you!
MONICA => -- and everybody started screaming at her like she was defending the Ku Klux Klan!
LISA => They are the Ku Klux Klan! They like to throw acid in women's faces!
MONICA ANGIE => Who does? The Afghanistans? Why don't you drop bombs -- Afghanies? The Iraqis? Then why don't you drop bombs on the Ku Klux Klan? LISA Because they're white? Yes! No! The Taliban! Do you wish they were LIONEL still there? There's six people with their hands raised before ANTHONY you, Lisa! The correct term is Afghans.
KLEIN => Because that's censorship, right? Right?
MONICA LISA => Yeah!  Right on! It's not censorship...! This class is not the ANGIE government! Thank you... !
ANTHONY => That's not technically LEWIS true. It's censorship.
LISA => Oh my God, no it's not!
JOAN => Ready?
MITCHELL => We actually work outta Highway One? Up in the Bronx? So for somethin' like this we just borrow a local precinct...
JOAN => Uh huh...
- MITCHELL => Would you say you had a clear line of vision?
LISA => Yes.
MITCHELL => OK, just describe what you saw to me in your own words? Lisa glances at Joan. Joan smiles at her encouragingly.
LISA => She just stepped out in the street?
LISA => How are you?
KARL => I'm great. I'm looking at a beautiful sunset over the ocean. Doing a little work. . .How are you?
LISA => I'm OK.
KARL => Practicing your horseback riding?
_ KARL => OK. Well. I would actually seriously recommend you go over to, uh, to Claremont Stables and see about getting some lessons.
LISA => No, I was actually really thinking about doing that...
KARL => So how's everything going? How's school?
LISA => School's OK. I'm kind of fucking up in geometry...
LISA => But my teacher's really cool. So I guess it's not too serious...
KARL => Yeah. Math was never my strong suit either.
LISA => Well, I am definitely following in your footsteps in that regard-How are you?
KARL => I'm fine. I'm good. Things are picking up a little bit, which is good. How's the boyfriend situation?
LISA => Oh the same. They're all kind of the same.
KARL => Uh huh? Well, next time you come out here I'll try to hook you up with some more interesting people than you seem to be meeting at the moment.
LISA => Thanks, Dad, I don't really go for the California type.
KARL => Well -- I don't either, per se. It
LISA => Hard to argue with. I think I'll stop generalizing,now...!
KARL => OK. Well, that's about all on my end, babe. I'll give you a call in a week or two. Give my love to Curtis, and say hello to your Mom.
LISA KARL => OK. Well, I love you. .It's gonna be really fun. Um -- Love you too.
LISA => Bye Dad.
JOAN => It's true. Two years of college. Two years at the magazine. Two years with you.
JOAN => I'm kind of a two-year gal...! IN THE LAUGHING AUDIENCE -- Lisa watches, unamused.
JOAN => What did you think of the play?
LISA => It was OK. Silence.
- JOAN => Well, thank you, honey.
LISA => What do you want me to say? JOAN I thought it was OK! Nothing! You said it! Next time I'll lie!
JOAN => Don't come next time!
LISA => I won't!
PAUL => Yeah, like I would be in a movie, only I would be doing exactly what I'm doing right now: like I'd be sitting here smoking a cigarette, and I'd have my feet up on. the desk, but the camera would be on me and I'd just be acting, except I wouldn't do anything differently from how I'm doing it right now. Nearby, BECKY and LISA are looking at a poster for "Guys and Dolls." It says "ONLY 3 WEEKS BEFORE THIS EARTH-SHATTERING
BECKY => I still don't get why you didn't even audition. You're such a good singer.
LISA => I still might do lights or something. But I'm not gonna make a fuckin' ass out of myself parading around in a play so I can ask everyone how great I was for three years afterwards like my fuck-ass mother.
LISA => Did I tell you guys I saw a woman get her leg cut off by a bus?
GIRLS => What? Really? Are you kidding?
LISA => Check out my boots.
GIRLS => Oh my God! What happened? Where were you? What did you see, etc?
JOAN => You do know I have two kids, right?
RAMON => Yes. I'd like to meet them.
JOAN => You are really smooth.
RAMON => I would love to meet your kids. I have two boys myself. I'm not smooth.  Would you like to have a nightcap?
JOAN => Oh, God.
BECKY => Are you aware that things have gotten to the point where I now have to hear things about you from other people and I can't even correct them because I no longer have any first-hand information about you myself?
LISA => What are you talking about?
BECKY => Nothing. I just feel like we used to be really close -- like, up until a few days ago. And I'm not really getting that from you anymore.
LISA => Becky. Give me a break. Pause.
BECKY => I can't believe you just said that to me. That was really hard for me to say, and that's you response?
LISA => Can we just go please?
BECKY => Fine. Get fuckin' out of my house!
LISA => Fine. But this is totally stupid because we're both going to the same party.
LISA => It's very hard to be cool under these circumstances.
PAUL => You don't have to be cool. All youhaveto do is snort it up your nose.
LISA => I'll try...! He gives her the spoon. She snorts it.
PAUL => And then you wanna do the other nostril because you always want to be symmetrical. Very important. She snorts some up the other nostril. Paul does some too and closes the vial. _
PAUL => Symmetry.
LISA => You are so funny...!  So what do we do now?
PAUL => Now we make out.
LISA => Paul...! What about your girlfriend?
PAUL => I'm sorry. It just sounded like you just asked me about my girlfriend.
LISA => Oh, never mind... They make out. He immediately starts feeling her up. She pushes his hand away.
PAUL => You're not serious.
LISA => Oh... No. He moves his hand back. She lets him.
LISA => Hey... You know I really love you, right?
DARREN => Not really. Pause. She kisses him softly and they make out for a minute.
LISA => I guess I'm not very consistent.
DARREN => I don't mind. He kisses her again. She draws back slightly.
- LISA => I gotta go home.
RAMON => Joan? Are you all right?
JOAN => Yes! Fine! Be out in a sec. She gets up, flushes the cigarette, looks in the mirror, tousles her hair, snaps off the light and opens the door.
MR AARON => Yes, Becky? Um -- Lisa?
LISA => Are you still mad at me about the test?
MR AARON => What's going on, Lisa?
LISA => .Because maybe my mother is right, and the bus driver is completely devastated as it is. And I'm just gonna be this little rich girl who calls up the cops to ease her conscience, and then ends up ruining somebody's life, when I'm the one who was distracting him in the first place.
MR AARON => What does your being rich have to do with anything?
LISA => You know what I mean.
LISA => Oh my God, I don't mean literally rich. My Dad makes like one bad TV commercial like, every two years, and my Mom lives from like, voice-Over to Voice Over. I mean rich compared to the bus driver.
MR AARON => OK...But I still don't see what any of that has to do with what you do or don't want to tell the investigating officers about the accident you witnessed.
LISA => Nothing, I guess. I'm sorry. When you're raised to be a knee-jerk Liberal you tend to think about these things. Lionel and a girl open the door.
MR AARON => Lionel? Tamara? It's gonna be five minutes.
LIONEL => I just thought you'd want to know there's like a lot of people out here and it's getting kind of hard to breathe.
MR AARON => You better close that door now, Lionel. Lionel closes the door.
MR AARON => All right: I have to let those guys in. I don't want to leave you hanging...If you're really hurtin'...we could get a cup of coffee after school...
LISA => I'd do that. Mr Aaron sighs a little.
JOAN => Does this-make me look fat?
LISA => Um, a little.
JOAN => Well, there's nothing I can do about it.
LISA => Where are you going?
JOAN => The opera...!
LISA => Why are you going to the opera?
JOAN => It turns out he's a really big opera fan...! Anyway, don't you think it's kind of fun? We should all go sometime.
LISA => Uh, no thanks.
JOAN => Why not? I bet you'd like it.
LISA => I don't like that kind of singing.
JOAN => But you like classical music.
LISA => Yes. That's true. But I don't like opera singing.
JOAN LISA => But when have you ever -- It's like their entire reason for existing is to prove how loud they can be. I don't really find that all that interesting.
JOAN => Yeah. I know what you mean. But it's not all like that. You like The Magic Flute.
LISA => OK. I guess I'm wrong. I guess I do like opera singing. I just didn't realize it.
JOAN => What is the matter with you?
LISA => Nothing at all! Why are you pushing this? I don't want to go to the opera!
JOAN => Yes! OK! It's called an invitation. I'm not pushing anything! All you have say is "No thanks!"
LISA => I did! And then you were like, "Why not?" So then I told you, and then you started like, debating me! Like you assume I've never thought this through for myself! Which I have! Many times!
JOAN => OK, well, that was a really Contemptuous assumption on my part. I don't actually like the opera that much myself. But I'm trying to expand my mind. Maybe that's wrong!  I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous about you guys meeting Ramon.
LISA => Why? What's the big deal? Why are you so influenced by what me and Curtis think? What Curtis and I think.
JOAN => Because obviously if I'm seeing somebody new it would important to me that you guys would like him and that he like you. Why wouldn't I be nervous about that?
LISA => I guess you would. Withdrawn.
JOAN => Hey...Why does everything I say annoy you?
LISA => Jesus Christ, I'm just sitting here!
JOAN => Here: you be me, and say anything, and I'll respond the way you've been responding to me this whole conversation.
LISA => No...!
JOAN => Go ahead: say something to LISA me and I'll say something No! I'm not gonna do to you the way you say that. everything to me -- Why not?
LISA => Because it's dumb! I'm horrible! I get your point!
LISA => Was that supposed to be an imitation of me?
JOAN => "Um, OK: Withdrawn."
LISA => Well, for someone who's supposed to be a professional actress that's a pretty lame- ass impersonation of someone in your own family. Lisa shakes her head and watches the TV. Pause.
JOAN => Are you coming to my opening night?
LISA => I will if I have to. Pause.
JOAN => You're a little cunt, do you know that?
LISA => Yes. You're a big cunt.
JOAN => OK. Let's not start talking to each other that way.
LISA => You just called me a cunt, Mom!
JOAN => OK, I'm sorry I said that. LISA But if you're really Why? It's refreshing!
JOAN => -- If you're really saying you're not aware that you've been really annoyed with me, or really irritable with me -- and it doesn't matter if_I express it exactly accurately: you know what I'm trying to say --!
LISA => Not really.
JOAN => if you're saying you're completely unaware of that, then I have to say I don't think you're being honest about it. Now maybe I'm doing something really horrible to you without being aware of it, but I have a show opening in two weeks, I'm very nervous about it, I'm seeing a new person and I'm obviously anxious about you and Curtis liking him -- whether you think I should be or not! -- you were involved in a horrible traumatic accident, you're going on this crazy horseback riding trip with your father --
LISA => Oh my God!
JOAN => -- which sounds like a recipe for disaster to me! And on top of everything else, Lisa, ever since I told you about Ramon you've been treating me like I'm insane!
LISA => Um, I think you're exaggerating slightly.
JOAN => Now what am I supposed to do?!
JOAN => What am I supposed to do?!
LISA => Just stop whining about everything! It doesn't matter. Norte of that matters at all! You've been in a million plays, you always get freaked out because of what some dumb critic is gonna say about your dumb play, I don't frankly give a shit about Ramon or who you're going out with this week --
JOAN => I never go out with anyone! LISA Don't talk to me that way! Right! I don't care! I've barely had a date in the last two years!
LISA => But I don't care about any of this! It doesn't matter! Your boyfriend doesn't matter! Your play doesn't matter, except to you! I don't care about New Mexico, because to tell you the truth I'm probably not even going --
JOAN => What do you mean?
LISA => -- and you want to know something else, Mom? There are more important problems in
JOAN => Well -- should I have him come up now? Or should I have him wait downstairs...?
LISA => Do whatever you want. I don't care!
JOAN => I don't even know what we're talking about.
LISA => I know you don't. That's the problem.
JOAN => Oh give me a break.
RAMON => Everything is all right?
JOAN => Oh, yeah. I'm so excited to be going to the opera! I don't think I've really gone more than one or two times!
RAMON => Well, I wish it wasn't Norma but it's still fun to go.
RAMON => You don't want to hear Norma?
JOAN => No -- I don't mean that. I just meant wouldn't it be funny if we just walked into one of the other events, like if we just went to see the Daniel Goldfarb play instead.
RAMON => I think you will enjoy this.
JOAN => It's beautiful...!
RAMON =>  Shhh.
PAUL =>  Yo.
LISA => Hey, Paul.
PAUL => Hey.
LISA => It's Lisa Cohen.
PAUL => Yeah, how's it going?
LISA => OK.  What have you been up to?
PAUL => Seeing some questionable movies. Not deciding where to go to college...
LISA => Sounds good... So...I was just thinking...This is gonna sound really queer, but...by any chance would you want to meet somewhere and like, take away my virginity?
PAUL => Um...all right.
LISA => Really? God, I'm so flattered.
PAUL => To what do I owe this inconceivable honor?
LISA => Actually it's because of my deep passionate feelings for you, Paul.
PAUL => That's pretty much what I figured... So, do you want to come over here? Should I come over there...?
LISA => Well, my Mom just went out for the evening...Except my little brother's getting dropped off at some point, come to think of it, so I'm actually supposed to be here when he gets home.
PAUL => All right.  Do you want to give me your address?
LISA =>  It's 252 West 85th Street...
LISA =>  Hello?
DARREN => Hey. What are you up to?
LISA => Hey, nothing. Writing my King Lear paper.
DARREN => Really? That's impressive.
LISA => Not really.
DARREN => I've just never known you to be so devoted to your studies before.
LISA => Well, I don't want to fail Humanities.
DARREN => You're not gonna fail Humanities.
LISA => No, probably not.
DARREN => So what did you do tonight?
LISA => Actually, Darren...I don't really feel like talking right now. Pause.
DARREN => Yeah. I'll talk to you later.
DARKEN => OK, bye.
PAUL => Hey.
LISA => Hey, come in. She steps aside. He passes her and comes in.
PAUL => I think I-just alienated one of your neighbors by smoking in the elevator.
LISA => Oh really? What did they say?
PAUL => She basically said there was no smoking in the elevator.
LISA => That's original... TRACKING them as they come into the living room...
LISA => So this is the living room.
PAUL => Very livable.
LISA => We like it...My Mom hasn't read any of these books, by the way.
PAUL => Have you?
LISA => Some of them. Not all of them. Paul looks at The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich.
PAUL => This book is a very cool book.
LISA => Yeah, I think the Third Reich may be a little bit too much for me right now.
PAUL => It's pretty hard to put down once you get started. -
LISA => Do you want anything to drink?
PAUL => I'd take a beer.
LISA => OK, I have no idea where the bottle opener is. -
PAUL => Here, lemme have them. He takes the beers and opens them on the edge of the counter. He makes two marks in the counter doing this.
LISA => Thanks.
PAUL => Whoops. I think I just permanently damaged your kitchen counter. Sorry.
LISA => Oh -- that's OK. Don't worry about it.
PAUL => Won't your "Mother" be "Upset?"
LISA => How come everything you say always sounds so ironic? You don't even have to do anything and it just comes out sounding like, totally ironic and funny.
PAUL => It's just a gift. She laughs nervously. They drink beer.
LISA => So...do you want to see my room?
PAUL => Sure.
LISA => This is my room. Ta da.
PAUL => Very nice. She realizes she has some stuffed animals on the bed.
LISA => And these are my stuffed animals.
PAUL => Always important to meet the stuffed animals.
LISA => These are some drawings I did...Not that I should be showing them to you, because I know you're like a really good artist, right?
PAUL => I would like to be a really good artist. At this point I think it would be more accurate to say I'm good at drawing.
LISA => Yeah, I just do it for fun. But I've always really liked it... He looks at her pictures.
LISA => So...can I ask you a question?
PAUL => Yes?
LISA => This is probably gonna sound very immature, but how can you be so relaxed, knowing what we're about to do? Or is it just like no big deal to you?  OK, that was a really stupid question and I'm like totally embarrassed right now. I'm actually more embarrassed than I've ever been in my life. If you want to go home now that's totally
PAUL => Easy there. Don't be embarrassed. It's basically like, the world's greatest
LISA => Yeah: I don't usually get nervous because I think it's worth it: I usually get nervous because I can't help the way I feel. Although I do think that if anything is worth getting nervous about, it's this. But maybe that's just really idealistic of me.
PAUL => There is that philosophy.
LISA => You are so funny...!
PAUL => Do you have an ashtray?
LISA => Oh you can just chuck it out the window. Paul struggles to open the window and tosses his cigarette. He closes the window and comes across the room to kiss her.
LISA => Are we starting?
PAUL => I was thinking about it, yeah.
LISA => And am I being really dorky right now?
PAUL => You're not suave.
LISA => I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous. Please ignore.
PAUL => Don't be nervous. I promise this is gonna be a great experience for you. You're gonna have like four, five hundred orgasms at least. He kisses her. They make out.
PAUL => OK, let's talk about your kissing. Don't panic. It's just a technical thing. Lisa collapses with her face in the bed out of shame.
LISA => What are you like the nicest guy in the world?
PAUL => No...
LISA => Like that?
PAUL =>  Yes...
LISA => in I supposed to go really fast at the end or something?
PAUL => Yeah, but we're gonna move on before
THAT-HERE => He shifts around and tries to go down on her.
LISA => You don't have to do that.
LISA => Don't do that, OK? I'm just embarrassed. Let me do it to you.
PAUL => All right.
PAUL => Are you ready?
LISA => Yeah.
PAUL => OK. This is a little tricky: It's probably gonna hurt a little, at first, but then it's gonna get better...Just be patient. There are certain technical difficulties on my end that have to be addressed or it's not gonna happen.
LISA => OK: You sound insane. They laugh.
PAUL => OK, ready?
PAUL => OK, hang on...
LISA => Ow!
PAUL => OK -- There we go. Does it hurt now?
LISA => Kind of, yeah.
PAUL => OK, just try to relax. It'll get better in a second...
LISA => Did you bring a condom?
PAUL => Uh huh...
LISA => Shouldn't you put it on?
PAUL => I will in a second.
LISA => This is really kind of hurting.
PAUL => OK -- one second.
LISA => I love you.
PAUL => What?
LISA => Nothing.
PAUL => OK -- hold on -- Shit --
LISA => What?
PAUL => OK, one second -- Ohh! Sorry -- Sorry -- He comes inside her. Silence. He carefully rolls over.
PAUL => Sorry about that. Kind of got away from me.
LISA => Did any of it get inside me?
PAUL => I don't know.
PAUL => Honest to God? It's probably OK. The odds are overwhelmingly that it's OK. O.C. the doorbell rings.
LISA => That's my little brother. She gets a bathrobe and goes out. We TRACK HER through the whole apartment. She opens the door for CURTIS.
LISA => Hi, Curtis.
CURTIS => Hi. We TRACK her back to her room. She shuts the door. PAUL has put on his underwear and is smoking a cigarette.
PAUL => Hey.
LISA => Hey.  Can I have a drag? (takes a drag of his cigarette) Thanks.
LISA => I'm actually kind of mad at you...
PAUL => Why?  Because we didn't use birth control?
LISA => I guess so.
PAUL => It was at the ready...
LISA => Well, I don't really want to get AIDS, you know? And I really don't want to have an abortion, because I know when you have one at my age it, can be really hard to get pregnant later on, and I definitely want to have children some day.
LISA => Oh, the "I'm A Total Fucking Moron" Pill?
PAUL => Well...that's the Canadian name.
LISA => Yes. I prefer not to put too many chemicals inside my body if I can avoid it. I'm sure it's fine...Or not...!
PAUL => Try to listen to me. Right about now is when you're traditionally supposed to freak out. So why don't you just not? You're not gonna get AIDS, because I don't have AIDS --
LISA => How do you know? Have you been tested?
PAUL => No, but I'm pretty sure I don't have it, because of my demographic. And the odds are you're probably not gonna have to have an abortion either. And since this was your first time, it might as well be a basically happy memory instead of a shitty one.
LISA => I'm sorry. I'm not completely in control of my emotions.  Anyway...Thank you for deflowering me.
PAUL => You're welcome.
LISA => Did it freak you out that I said I love you?
PAUL => No...It didn't freak me out.
LISA => You don't have to say it back, because I know you probably have like no feelings at all for me.
PAUL => I think I_just proved I have some feelings for you.
LISA => You should probably go now...
PAUL => Yo.
LISA => That's my brother.
PAUL => What's up?
CURTIS => Hi. Lisa walks Paul to the front door.
JOAN => Oh, I loved it! It was so exciting!
RAMON ' => Good! We should go again!
JOAN => But how about those people yelling "Bravi!" and "Brava!"
RAMON => How do you mean?
JOAN => It's just so pretentious. "Bravi!" "Bravi!" Why can't they just say "Bravo?"
RAMON => Well, it's the plural.
JOAN => I know --
RAMON => It's the plural of "bravo." It's what they say to acknowledge the ensemble.
JOAN => No, I know, I know it's correct, it just -- don't you think there was something a little pretentious about those people?
RAMON => Pretentious?
JOAN => I don't mean they didn't really enjoy it...But you know how you can really be enjoying something -- but you're also kind of looking around out of the corner of your eye -- because you know people are watching you enjoy it...? Does that make sense at all?
RAMON => Yes, but I wouldn't say that it was pretentious. In Italian you say "Bravo" for a man and "Brava" for a woman, and "Bravi" for the whole company.
JOAN => Uh huh? OK, I see what you mean.
RAMON => You use the masculine for the male singer and the feminine for the female singer.
JOAN => Yeah...Anyway, I really enjoyed it. Thank you.
RAMON => We'll have to go again.
JOAN => It was so glamorous...!
LISA => Cue thirty-six, go.
MATTHEW => Why are we stopping?
GARY => Now I know there's been a lot of shit going on between a lot of the people in this room..But I wanna tell you something: You've worked too fucking hard for this show to be derailed now by the kind of bullshit I know has been going on around here. Now, I'll bet you there's not one person working on this show who hasn't got somebody they want to say something to, including me. So I'm gonna start. Matthew?
GARY => Yes. I mean you. Matthew comes slowly into the middle of the circle.
MATTHEW => Yes?
GARY => You are probably one of the most talented kids who's ever performed at this school. But you're too Goddamn lazy, you think you can just waltz through this part, and it's pissing me off. Because this show cannot come together until you learn your fucking lines. OK? _
MATTHEW => So you'd like me to memorize them. Everyone laughs.
GARY => Yes, I'd like you to memorize them! Now.  Your turn!
MATTHEW => But I'm not mad at anyone. I just want everyone to think I'm a great guy. Everyone laughs.
LISA => But I'm jealous of you...
BECKY => Why would you be jealous of me...!
LISA => Because of everything! 'Cause you always get such good grades and your family never has to worry about money, and your parents are still together, and I'm really jealous of your other friends!
BECKY => Well, I'm really sorry if I hurt you!
LISA => Me too! They embrace tearfully. Many of the kids are moved. Some are not. Becky leaves Lisa in the circle. Lisa wipes her eyes.
LISA => Darren...? Darren unglues himself from his perch on a table, and sits in the circle with her.
LISA => I know that I'm not who you want me to be to you. And I know how much I've hurt you. But I still can't believe it means we can't be friends anymore! So much has been happening to me this semester --
DARREN => Yes you can. Of course you can. You can talk to me about anything.
LISA => I don't love anybody more than you! You're practically my best friend!
DARREN => I love you too. I really do...! They hug and cry. LESLIE raises her hand.
GARY => Leslie?
LESLIE => Can I just say, I think this show is like two and a half seconds away from being fucking amazing, and if we could all just work together, instead of being AT each other all the time, I think we could all just be incredible. Everyone applauds, except ANGIE, who raises her hand.
ANGIE => Yeah.  Yeah. I'm gonna say it. I feel really fucked over by some of the people in this room. I'm not saying I'm not gonna do my job, but for some reason, a lot of the actors in this show seem to think that this whole show is about them. And I think I speak for a lot of the techies when I say that I feel really unappreciated and basically fucked over. And I don't know if I can get over it. I don't. That's all. Nobody says anything. PAUL raises a hand. His pretty GIRLFRIEND is seated next to him.
GARY => Yes, Paul?
PAUL => Yeah, I'm just playing in the band, you know? This is hicrh school. You know? I don't really feel a strong need to like, all be on the same team with everybody. I just want to come to rehearsals, do the show, go up on the roof and smoke some pot, and then like, go on home. I don't really wanna cry and hug anybody. There are laughs and some cheers.
GARY => Oh you wanna hug me a little, don't you Paul?
PAUL => OK, Gary, man, I'll give you a little hug. No kissin' though. Gary charges over and hugs Paul. Everyone laughs and claps. Gary grabs Paul's face and kisses him on the cheek. Everyone is laughing. Lisa looks at Paul, who settles back with his girlfriend. He sees Lisa looking at him and gives her a little salute. Lisa catches DARREN's eye. He is looking at her with the unwelcome gaze of love. She looks away. His heart hardens against her.
STATION. DAY. => Lisa is on-the phone. Curtis is watching TV.
LISA => Hi, my name-is Lisa Cohen. I was a witness in a bus accident case a few weeks ago...
MITCHELL => Yeah, hi, Lisa, what can I do for you?
LISA => Well, this is probably gonna sound a little weird, but are you allowed to tell me how to get in touch with that woman's family? I'm obviously probably too late to go to the funeral, but I really wanted to send some flowers or something.
MITCHELL => Yeah, I can --
LISA => Or is that like classified information?
MITCHELL => No no. Family's been notified...Lemme see what I got.
LISA => She mentioned she had a daughter...
MITCHELL => Lemme just... OK: I don't have anything for a daughter. The only contact I have is a cousin, Abigail Berwitz. I got a number in Arizona...
LISA => So did you have the trial, or whatever? Or did you make the -- did they have a ruling yet?
MITCHELL => Yes. It was, uh, No Criminality found.
LISA => No Criminality.
MITCHELL => Right.
LISA => Wow. That's a -- great system you got. OK. Wow.
LISA => Yeah.
LISA => Yes, I'm trying to reach Abigail Berwitz?
ABIGAIL => This is Abigail.
LISA => Hi, my name is Lisa Cohen. You don't know me...I...
ABIGAIL => Yes? Hello?
LISA => Hi. Sorry. Yeah. I was actually calling about your cousin, Monica Patterson?
LISA => I was actually there when she had -- during the accident. I didn't know her, but I was the one who was with her when she died...
LISA => Yeah. I was sort of holding her hand at the time...
ABIGAIL => Yes? What can I do for you?
LISA => OK. Well, ummm, I saw her obituary in the paper, but I didn't see anything about a funeral. I assume they had one, because --
LISA => I'm sorry: and I was also wondering, she said something about her daughter?
ABIGAIL LISA => No. Her daughter -- She wanted someone No -- Her's daughter's to get ahold of her? not alive -- She -- I'm sorry: passed away quite a long time ago.
LISA => Oh my God. Was it...Was she sick? Or was
ABIGAIL => She had leukemia.
LISA => Oh my gosh. And -- do you mind if I ask: Was her name Lisa?
ABIGAIL => Yes...?
LISA => OK, see, that explains it. See, I think she thought --
ABIGAIL => Could I just interrupt? How did you get this number?
LISA => Oh -- the police -- I asked the Accident Investigating investigator who to contact if I wanted to --
ABIGAIL => I have been getting calls about this for three weeks! One of Monica's neighbors gave the police my number and all of a sudden I am the focal point for all these arrangements! And I gotta tell you people, I didn't have any kind of relationship with Monica whatsoever, unless you want to count the fact that she held up my children's inheritance for fifteen years. I guess we're just supposed to forget about all that now. And I am more than willing. But the perso n you should be calling is Emily Morrison, who was Monica's friend and is the person who has been dealing with all of this in New York. But it has nothing to do with me.
LISA => I'm sorry! I didn't really know who to
ABIGAIL => Now I can give you her number, but I would very much appreciate it if the calls would stop.
LISA => Yes -- Please. Can you hold on while I get a pen?
ABIGAIL => Yes, all right.
EMILY => I guess it would be all right ...It's only going to be a few close friends, and some clients I imagine...
LISA => Oh so was she a lawyer?
EMILY => Monica? No. She was a social worker. She used to be, anyway. She had -- several careers.
LISA => Were you really good friends with her?
EMILY => Yes I was.
JOAN => Where you going, sweetie?
LISA => I'm going to that woman's funeral.
JOAN => Are you sure you don't want me to come?
LISA => Why? I don't even know her.
JOAN => I would be coming for you.
EMILY => Hi. Are you Lisa?
LISA => Yeah. Thank you so much for letting me come.
EMILY => Why don't you come on in? We're about to start. Do you want anything to drink?
LISA => Oh -- Um -- no thanks.
EMILY => We have bad hors d'oeuvres and good hors d'oeuvres.
LISA => Oh - that's quite all right, thank you.
EMILY => Well-thank you all for coming.
WOMAN MOURNER => Thank you for doing this, Emily.
THE MOURNERS => Yes, thank you, Emily.
EMILY => As you all know, Monica was not a religious woman. Anybody who ever had to sit through a wedding or a funeral with her knows how she felt about formal occasions. So Harry and Elise and I, when we were talking about this, decided we would just have everyone over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk. about Monica just talk about her. Maybe share some remembrances of her. Some of us know each other, some of us don't. But we're all here because we loved Monica. And because we want to pay tribute to her in a way that might conceivably not enrage her. Everyone laughs slightly.
EMILY => I don't want to tell anyone what to think, or how to feel. And I don't want to kid myself about the stupid, meaningless way she died, because it would really make her throw up. But I don't want it to become the summation of her life. Because it's not. When her Lisa died I said to her, "How can you stand it?" And she said. "First of all I can't. But I don't want to take away the twelve years she did have, and turn them all into leukemia. Because they weren't." So despite the fact that she got -- ripped off, I do think it's important to remember that Monica got a lot out of life. She was the most fully developed person I personally have ever known. She was also impossible to get along with, but that's another story. Everybody laughs.
EMILY => As most of you know, she had more than her share of trouble over the years. But that never diminished her compassion or stopped her from embracing life to the absolute fullest -- measure.
2ND MOURNER => She sure did.
EMILY => So. Now I've said my little piece. And now I want to talk a little bit about the first time we met. She was twenty one. Emily stops so as not to cry. There is a long, charged silence.
WOMAN MOURNER => It's OK, Emily.
EMILY => I know...!  And I was nineteen! Even though it's impossible for my children to believe I.was ever that young. Emily's college-age kids, a boy and a girl, smile warmly at her from across the room.
LISA => Emily, thank you so much for letting me be here.
EMILY => Don't be silly, honey. You were sweet to come by.
LISA => Didn't she have any family?
EMILY => No, she was the last one. Except for some cousins in Arizona. You talked to Abigail. She's the one who gave you my number...
LISA => Yeah...
EMILY => Well, she's a living nightmare. They never got along at all.
WOMAN MOURNER => Excuse me. Good bye, Emily. Thank you so much for doing this. Emily and the Woman Mourner hug each other goodbye.
EMILY => Listen. I still can't believe this is happening...!  I mean what the fuck is wrong with her?
WOMAN MOURNER => I don't know!
EMILY => I don't understand why she didn't kill herself when Lisa died! And then Barry, and then after all that with her mother, and then her father, she gets hit by a fucking bus? It's like a joke! But that's Monica. Always the worst luck. Always. (noticing LISA) OK, sweetheart. Thank you for coming. Please don't stand there staring at me, OK?
LISA =>  I'm sorry! I just wanted to say goodbye.
EMILY => It's OK. Thank you for coming. You're very sweet.
LISA =>  Goodbye.
WOMAN MOURNER => Goodbye. As Lisa-goes out she hears:
WOMAN MOURNER => Who is that?
EMILY => That's a girl who was passing by at the time of the accident. She was right-there when she died, and she wanted to come to the funeral. I told her there was no funeral, but she wanted to come anyway. I wouldn't have done that at her age, would you?
WOMAN MOURNER => No...
LISA => No -- M A R E T T I .. What about Brooklyn? . Thank you.
LISA => I don't know.
JOHN => Take a stab. What do you think Shakespeare is saying about human suffering here?
LISA => I don't know. Sorry.
JOHN => You know what, Lisa? That's not good enough. That's not good enough. Shakespeare wrote something: What's your response? And don't tell me you don't have one because I don't buy it.
LISA => I don't really have a lot to say. It seems pretty self-evident to me.
JOHN =>  Matthew?
MATTHEW => I think it is self-evident. I think he's saying that human beings don't mean any more to the gods than flies do to little boys who like to torture them for fun.
MATTHEW => Like as far as the gods are concerned we're just ants. Nothing. (like a newscaster turning to his colleague) Darren? The class laughs.
DARREN =>  Thank you, Matthew. Yeah, I agree. Only it's not Shakespeare saying it: It's Gloucester. Maybe another character would have a different point of view.
JOHN => OK: That's a valid point. Just because Shakespeare has one of his characters say it doesn't mean he personally agrees with it. Yes: David?
DAVID => Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying the gods don't care about us. Maybe he's saying there's a higher consciousness that we can't see. That the gods' perception of reality is so much more developed than ours that compared to their perception, our perceptions are like comparing flies to
JOHN => OK...I don't think that's what he's getting at...I think what he's getting at here is a very dark view of the arbitrary nature of human suffering.
DAVID => But maybe he's not. Maybe he's comparing human consciousness to divine consciousness, and he's saying that even though it seems to us that human suffering is just arbitrary, that's just because we're limited by our viewpoint.
JOHN => Well -- let's look at the text. Let's test David's hypothesis. "We are to the gods as flies to wanton boys. They kill us for their sport." I have to agree with Matthew, that seems pretty unambiguous.
DAVID => Yeah, because he's saying there's a higher purpose that we can't see. He's saying that what seems like them killing us for sport could just be because our consciousness isn't developed enough to see what the higher wisdom of their killing us is.
JOHN => OK, but -- I still don't think that's what he's trying to say. Um...
DAVID => No, like if you say they kill us for their sport, when our perception of the gods is so meager that we can't even tell what they're doing, then how can we be so arrogant as to think that they would bother to kill us for their sport?
MONICA => I don't think that's what he's saying at all. I think he's saying the gods don't give a shit about human beings and they just kill and torture us for fun --
MATTHEW => Yes. Much like flies to wanton boys. Anybody? Anybody?
MONICA => Yeah...1
DAVID => But if the gods' consciousness is so much more developed than ours that we seem like flies to them, then how can we be sure what they have in mind for us or why they do anything?
JOHN => David, I think you've made your point. But it's not what Shakespeare meant. Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that he's trying to say something about human suffering here --
DAVID => Scholarly opinion...:
JOHN => And in this particular play what I think he's trying to say is pretty black -- pretty bleak --
DAVID => But what are you saying? A thousand Frenchmen can't be wrong?
JOHN => No, I'm not saying that. But I would like to move on --
DAVID => I think he is saying that, because he's comparing human consciousness to flies, and he's saying that we can't see the truth around us because our consciousness is undeveloped.
JOHN => No David, that's not what Shakespeare meant! He says it somewhere else in the play, but I don't want to get hung up on this any more because it's not what Shakespeare meant, and I would really like to move on. David laughs derisively.
LISA => Hi Dad.
KARL => Yeah! Hi! How's everything been going?
LISA => OK. How are you?
KARL => Not too bad. Pretty good. I'm sitting here listening to some music. Having a glass of delicious beer.
LISA => That sounds pleasant.
KARL => Yeah. Yeah. How are you? How's the boyfriend situation?
LISA => Well...there's this one guy I sort of had something going with. But he kind of has a girlfriend, so...
KARL => Uh huh?
LISA => I realize I'm incredibly enthralling...
KARL => You are. You're a beautiful girl. And you've got brains. That makes you dangerous.
LISA => Don't forget mature.
KARL => Well -- I'm hoping you're not too mature.
LISA => No...Don't worry.
KARL => OK good. That was a good answer,.
LISA => Anyway, I do think it's a pretty long- standing relationship...
KARL => OK, then you know what? You do nothing. You do absolutely nothing. And one of two things will happen. Either he's gonna start doing back flips to get your attention, or you're gonna send him a crystal clear signal that if he doesn't do back flips he's not gonna get your attention. OK?
LISA => Well, I think he already knows I like him.
KARL => Uh huh? OK...
LISA => .I think I might have spilled the beans on that one a little --
KARL => That's OK. Because now, if now you stop acknowledging him, you just suddenly give him nothing, he's gonna go berserk. Unless he's just not interested. In which case, you gotta take your lumps. OK? Which is tough.
LISA => Well, thanks, Dad. I'll be sure to try out the technique next time I see him.
KARL => Yeah. Lemme know what happens.
KARL => OK. Well, everything's OK here...A little
LISA => Actually, Dad? I definitely want to hear how things are with you in a minute, but I actually have something kind of serious I want to ask you about ...I'm kind of soliciting people I respect-for their views on this...
KARL => OK. What's up?
LISA => . so do you think I should go back to the police, or what?
KARL => OK, well, first of all, I'm very glad you told me. Second of all, I think you should let me call my friend who's a lawyer, just to get some idea of what the ramifications would be.
LISA => You mean to protect myself before I go back?
KARL => There's nothing wrong with knowing what you're getting into. I'm gonna call my friend Lorne, I want to see what he says. ANNETTE, Karl's, girlfriend, 40, lets herself into the house.
ANNETTE LISA => Hey...! Actually, Dad? Please don't call anybody. KARL Seriously. I appreciate Hi babe. your taking charge and everything, but -- ANNETTE Hello? Did you get my message?
KARL => Um -- I got a message.
ANNETTE => About the flowers? For my mother?
KARL => I don't know. Yes. Hold on. (To LISA) I'm sorry, Annette just walked in.
LISA => That's OK.
ANNETTE => Who are you talking to?
KARL => I'm -- It's -- could I just --
LISA => Anyway, I guess I would just like to know later that I would have done the right thing by myself, if you see what I mean. Because I don't think I have so far.
KARL => Uh huh?
ANNETTE LISA => Who is that? Not that I'm trying to make this woman's KARL horrible death into my own Uh Huh? It's Lisa. personal moral gymnasium... to quote George Bernard ANNETTE Shaw. Good. Will you please ask her
KARL => I'm sorry, Lisa. Hold on one second.
ANNETTE => Will you please ask her if there's anything we don't know about that she won't eat? For the trip? Because I have to tell the ranch, because they do all the meals ahead of time
KARL => Yes: I will: We're just in the middle of something.
ANNETTE => Karl, I was supposed to call them last week. You said you were gonna call her and you didn't. So then I called her, and she never called me back. So what do you want me to do?
KARL => OK, you know what? I want to talk about this, not right now.
ANNETTE => -- and if there's anything she can't eat and they put it in the hampers, she's not gonna have anything to eat. The last time she came out here we went to three different places and she couldn't eat anything on the menu.
KARL => I'm going to ask her. I will. We're right in the middle of something.
ANNETTE => OK. Tell her I said hi.
LISA => Hello?
LISA => Mom? What's wrong?...Did you have a bad show? What time is it?. Joan starts coughing. Blood starts coming out with every cough, first a little, then a gruesome amount -- LISA WAKES UP -- breathing hard short breaths. The room is dark and quiet. She calms down and gets up.
MRS MARETTI => Hi, can help you?
LISA => Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. My name is Lisa Cohen. I was involved in the same accident that Mr Maretti was involved in a few weeks ago...
MRS MARETTI => Oh my God, were you? Oh my God, what a thing, huh?
LISA => Yeah...I was just wondering if I could talk to him fora minute. Is he home?
MRS MARETTI => Ummmmm, yeah, sure. Whyn't you come in.
LISA => Hi. I'm really sorry to bother you...We never met. My name is Lisa Cohen...
MARETTI => Yeah...What can I do for you?
LISA => Well...do you remember me? From the bus accident?
MARETTI => I don't know.. .What' s this about?
LISA => Well, would it be OK if I talked to you for a minute?
MARETTI => What do you want to talk about? I don't understand.
LISA => I'd just like to talk about the accident for a minute. I don't want anything, and I'm not here to do anything bad. I just wanted to talk to you about it.
MARETTI => How did you get my address?
LISA => It's in the phone book. I was gonna call first...
MARETTI => Well, it woulda been better if you woulda called. We're about to sit down... Mrs Maretti has drifted back toward them.
MARETTI => I don't get what, uh...Yeah all right. Let's go outside.
LISA => I'm sorry: Could I use your bathroom?
MARETTI => No, let's just go outside.
MRS MARETTI => Oh Gerry, let her use the bathroom.
MARETTI => No, I don't want her to use the bathroom. I don't understand what this is.
MRS MARETTI => It's right over there, honey. Will you kids settle down, please! I'm not kiddin'! Lisa goes in the bathroom.
MARETTI =>  Honey, just do me a favor, wait inside.
MRS MARETTI => No. I wanna hear what this is.
LISA => Well ...If it's OK, I'd rather talk to Mr Maretti in private.
MRS MARETTI => No it's not OK.
MARETTI => OK. We're just tryin' to...OK: What? Lisa looks at them, wishing Mrs Maretti would leave.
LISA => OK. I hope this isn't going to insult you too much...
MARETTI => Insult me...?
LISA => .I was just wondering if you felt bad at all about what happened.
MARETTI => Do I feel bad about the accident?
LISA => Yeah.
MRS MARETTI => You know, honey? Are you just upset about the accident...?
LISA => Yes! I'm upset about the accident! I'm very
MRS MARETTI => Gerry... why don't we all go inside and sit
MRS MARETTI. => OK, what is goin' on here?
MARETTI => Nothin's goin' on here. So whyn't you calm down? Look: Go ahead inside. Let me find out what this is. Meantime whyn't you make sure those kids aren't killin' each other, all right?
MRS MARETTI => All right.
LISA => I just...Well, I just want you to know...
MARETTI => Yes? What? Speak!
LISA => Well... you probably already know, obviously, that I told-the police on the police report that I thought the whole, thing was an accident...
MARETTI => Uh huh. Right. Because it was an accident.
LISA => Well -- I mean, I know you didn't do it on purpose.
MARETTI => On purpose...?
LISA => But it wasn't like...
MARETTI => What.  Speak. Talk! What!
LISA => Well ...I mean ...We were looking at each other...
MARETTI => Who was looking at each other...? You and me?
LISA => Well ...Yeah ...I mean. . .not like... romantically or anything...
MARETTI => Romantically...!
LISA => OK, scratch that. 'Cause that's not even... relevant...
LISA => OK. I can see the way this is.
MARETTI => The way what is? What! Speak to me! What?
LISA => I am --
MARETTI => Don't drag me outta my house on a Saturday afternoon and then make me stand here pullin' teeth to find out what you're talkin' about.
MARETTI => I've got my kids inside: You're an attractive young lady, you show up at the house -- Please! Get to the point or go home. Because I don't care enough, frankly, to stand around here tryin' to figure out what you're doin' here!  What! What! What! What!
LISA => All right! Well...the way I remember the accident is that you were wearing this cowboy hat --
MARETTI => Yes, it's my cowboy hat that I wear sometimes to amuse myself on the bus, yes. I was probably wearing my cowboy hat, yes. What.
LISA => If you could just let me...! From my point of view, I was out that day trying to buy a cowboy hat, so I was waving at you, becase I was looking for one... and you were kind of waving back...And I know the police already decided it was No Fault, or No Criminality or whatever they call it --
MARETTI => No Criminality, that's right.
LISA => -- I guess partly because of what I told them. And I know I was distracting you, but -- I did see the bus go through the red light. And that's when it hit that woman.
MARETTI => OK. I'm gettin' a little confused over here.
LISA => Only nobody said that to them. And I just wanted to like, acknowledge with you that that's what happened.
MARETTI => OK. First of all, I don't really know what you mean by wavin' at you...What were you, tryin' to catch the bus...?
LISA => No...Yes. But I wanted to ask about your --
MARETTI => Maybe I was wavin' at you like, wavin' to say, you know, "Step away from the bus," if the bus was in motion, I would've waved you away for your-own safety, but that's all that would be.
LISA => You don't remember looking at me and waving at me? Mrs. Maretti comes out again.
MARETTI => No. Not really. No.
LISA => Well ...I think we both remember something different.
MRS MARETTI => Your brother's on the phone.
MARETTI => Tell him I'll call him back. Mrs Maretti goes back inside.
LISA => I'm not trying to get you in trouble.
MARETTI => I know you're not, because you couldn't get me in trouble. Uhhhh, there's no criminality found...the report is, uh, final. And that's it.
LISA => So you're just gonna leave it?
MARETTI => I'm gonna leave it, because that's all that it was. If something else would have happened, I'd take it to whatever that was. It was tragic, it was a tragedy. But there's only a certain speed the brakes can react. That's a physical limitation of the machine. I don't know what else to tell you. It was a shock. It's shock. But that's it. Can't bring her back. Cannot bring her back.
LISA => I'm not talking about bringing her back. .I'm talking about telling the accident investigators what really happened.
MARETTI => But you already talked to them!
LISA => I know that. But I lied.
MARETTI => You lied.
LISA => Yes. And I can understand if you don't want to get in trouble, but.--
MARETTI => Then how come nobody else saw it?
LISA => I can't help what other people saw --
MARETTI => You would think somebody else would see it.
LISA => I just know what I saw!
MARETTI => Then why didn't you say something right then?
LISA => Because -- when they were asking me what happened -- it seemed like you were kind of looking at me -- like we were saying to each other, "Let's not say anything about what happened."
MARETTI => Oh, now I really don't know what you're talkin' about.
LISA => I can't prove that you were doing that -- Mrs Maretti comes back outside.
MARETTI => What did I say anything to you? Did I threaten you?
LISA => No! And I am not blaming you for any of this! All I'm saying is that I didn't really tell the cops what happened, and I didn't want to go back without --
MRS MARETTI => Gerry! Take it easy!
MARETTI =>  No, it's all right. Leave it alone. (To LISA) You wanna ruin my life, start tellin' 'em about looks, and you waved at me and I had on my cowboy hat, go ahead! You're gonna go back to school and do your homework and I'm gonna lose my job! And who's gonna feed my kids? You? Are you gonna do it? And for what! She's dead! She's dead! And there's nothin' I-can do to bring her back!
LISA => I just want to say what really happened.
MARETTI => Hey do whatever you fuckin' want.
MRS MARETTI => Gerry -- !
MARETTI => But those cops are gonna laugh in your fuckin' face because this was not my fault!
LISA => It was both our fault.
MARETTI => What'd you say?
LISA => It was both our fault. Maretti scrambles in his pocket for a pen.
MARETTI => Yeah. Don't say that to me.again without a lawyer. Gimme your phone number.
MARETTI => What's your number? Gimme LISA your number. Oh, you wanna Mjy? No! Why do you want it? come to my house like some anonymous person, I can't get in touch with you? MRS MARETTI What's your fuckin' number, Gerry! Take it easy! Lisa Cohen!
LISA => Fine! It's -- um -- 212- 555 --
MARETTI => Hold on.  555 --
LISA => 0157. Why do you need it?
MARETTI => Do whatever you're gonna do. I hope you got a good lawyer.
LISA => I don't know why you're -- Maretti turns and goes in the house.
MRS MARETTI => You know this was very traumatic for him!
MRS MARETTI => Does your mother know you're here?
LISA => Yes.
EMILY => Why didn't you say anything before?
LISA => I guess I was afraid. I didn't know what to do.
EMILY => You didn't know what to do? The woman is killed right in front of you and you didn't know what to do?
LISA => I know it doesn't sound very impressive.
EMILY => Impressive!  All right: I know you're trying to do the right thing now. What does your mother say?
LISA => My mother hasn't really been that helpful.
EMILY => What do you mean?
LISA => I mean she's got a lot going on right now and she just hasn't been that interested, I guess.
EMILY => What could she possibly have going on?
LISA => Her show is opening.
EMILY => What do you mean, her show? What show?
LISA => She's in a play.
EMILY => My friend is dead because some guy was looking at your ass and you lied to the police about it, and your mother can't be bothered because she's in a play?
LISA => Well, it's kind of a big deal for her. She has a really big part.
EMILY => I'm sorry. I don't know your mother, but, that is pretty shocking.
LISA => I guess she's really worried about getting a bad review or something.
EMILY => OK. I'm gonna talk to my friend who's a lawyer, and I'm gonna call Monica's cousin - you talked to her -- And you're gonna go talk to the police. Do you want me'to-go with you?
LISA => No thanks.
EMILY => Do you think maybe you should ask your mother to go with you?
LISA => I think I can handle this part myself.
EMILY => Oh, I am so angry. I am so angry.
LISA => He didn't do it on purpose.
EMILY => Fuck him! I'm gonna run over his best friend and then coerce some teenage girl into lying to the police about it! He had his chance. Fuck him! Now are you gonna see this through or not?
LISA => I will if you will.
EMILY => OK! Thank you. OK? Emily impulsively and somewhat tearfully embraces Lisa, who is flooded with relief.
JOAN => You want to fire me, go ahead and fire me. Only don't tiptoe around me like.some-kind of deranged ballerina every time I see you in the fucking hall! Now: Do you have anything to say to me, Eliot?
VICTOR => Um -- you're not fired...? This gets a pretty big laugh from the audience.
JOAN => Oh.  What are you guys talking about? Another big laugh. IN THE AUDIENCE -- LISA, CURTIS and RAMON sit together, dressed up for opening night. Ramon nudges Lisa.
RAMON => She's good, eh?
LISA =>  Yes...
JOAN => Did you find it?
LISA => Just a minute!
JOAN => Can we just forget it? If they were any good somebody would have called me last night.
LISA => No we can't forget it, because I can't take this anymore. What do you care what they say about you anyway?
JOAN => I don't. It's just a lousy feeling. Can't you understand that? If they wrote mean things about you in the newspaper you wouldn't like it. Even if you didn't agree with it, or base your self-esteem on it. Why can't you understand that?
LISA => I do understand it, because we have this conversation every time! You're great in the play, you're a great actress, everybody thinks you're great, everything about you is great, you're really really pretty --
JOAN => Oh shut up.
LISA => So let me just find the review and then we can both kill ourselves, OK?
JOAN => Fine. Lisa finds The New York Times review online.
JOAN => Did you find it?
LISA => Yes.
JOAN => Is it bad?
LISA => Let me read it.  OK, it's really good.
JOAN => It is?
LISA => Oh my God. Listen to this:
JOAN => Don't read it to me.
LISA => ".. .but it is the frankly extraordinary Joan Kaplan who transforms the savage wit of David Holmes' acid comedy-drama into something approaching sheer luminosity..."
JOAN => Get out.
LISA => "But don't be misled by her feather-light touch and expert comic timing. With the canny  bray...
JOAN => Bravura?
LISA => Yes. "-- of an actor at the JOAN Top of Craft, Ms. Kaplan takes Top of Craft...? us on an emotional roller coaster that is both hilarious and heartbreaking, maddening and magical."
JOAN => Shut up!
LISA => OK. This is the best review I've ever read.
JOAN => Just for me, or for everyone?
JOAN => Fuck him, what does he know? (A la Noel Coward) Maddening and magical, eh? If only I knew what that meant.
LISA => Oh my God you're a huge star.
JOAN => Oh my God!
LISA => Can I make coffee now?
JOAN => Yes. Thank you honey. Lisa heads for the kitchen as the PHONE RINGS.
LISA => Here come the offers.
JOAN =>  Hello?... . I know, can you believe it?
JOHN => Spring and Fall to a young girl by Gerard Manley Hopkins. "Margaret are you grieving Over Goldengrove unleaving? Leaves, like the things of man, you With your fresh thoughts care for, can you? Ahl as the heart grows older It will come to such thoughts colder
JOHN => By and by, nor spare a sigh Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie,
JOHN => And yet you will weep, and know why. Now no matter, child, the name: Sorrow springs are the same. Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed What heart heard of, ghost guessed: It is the blight man was born for, It is Margaret you mourn for." Silence.
JOHN => Any thoughts? Lisa? Lisa looks up slowly.
LISA => Um, yeah. Is Detective Mitchell here?
LISA => Oh. Um -- I talked to him on Monday and he said he'd be here after three...
LISA => Um, well, do you know when do you expect him?
LISA => I was involved in an accident a few weeks
LISA => And I filled out a report with Detective Mitchell, but wanted to amend the report, so I thought I should --
LISA => Well, there was something I didn't tell him, and I wanted to tell him, because --
LISA => Yes! Yes! I want to change my statement. Yes.
LISA => Yes. I know. That's why I asked to see Detective Mitchell. Who said he'd be here now. Which he's not. So...
LISA => No. Sorry. It was that woman Monica Patterson, who got run over by the bus, on Broadway -- it was in a lot of the newspapers...
LISA => I assume it was. But part of the reason it's closed is because of my statement. And the statement I gave --
LISA => Yes.
LISA => I mean --
LISA => I'm sure it does. I obviously didn't mean I personally closed the case, like, legally. I meant that what I said was probably instrumental in getting the case closed, because I was the --
LISA => Lisa Cohen.
LISA => Don't call me honey, OK? Pause.
LISA => Are you not gonna help me now that I said that?
LISA => Lisa Cohen!
LISA => I'm calm right now!
MITCHELL => This guy been givin' you a hard time?
LISA => No...
MITCHELL => What's this guy been sayin' to you?
LISA => Nothing. I don't know if you remember me... I'm Lisa Cohen. I called you on Monday?
MITCHELL => Sure I do. What's up?
MITCHELL => So now you're sayin' he ran the light.
LISA => Yes. He wasn't even looking at the road. And I was definitely trying to get his attention...
MITCHELL => No, I get the picture. So you're flirtin' with this guy, he's wavin' at you, he runs the light, hits the decedent, she dies on the scene...the both of youse lie to me on both of your statements, and then somewheres in there you turn around, decide the guy belongs in jail. That right? That about right?
LISA => I don't have any control over if he goes to jail or not. I certainly have my hopes. I just want to set the record straight, so that if he gets away with this I won't have been a part of it.
MITCHELL => And what do you think I should do with you? Just gimmea clue. 'cause I'm just a little bit lost over here...:
LISA => Do whatever you want. I know what I did.
MITCHELL => OK. Well. Before we do anything, Lisa, anybody will tell you that just because he ran a red light is not a criminal offence.
LISA => Even if he kills someone?
LISA =>  So he's not liable to be prosecuted for manslaughter? Or second degree murder?
MITCHELL => No. He could be charged with reckless driving, and fillip' out a false police report. Which, that's no joke --
LISA => That's unbelievable! What does he have to do? Kill her on purpose?
MITCHELL => Yes. Because that's the definition of murder. Killin' somebody on purpose. You're not sayin' he ran her over on purpose, are you? Pause.
LISA => No. Pause.
MITCHELL => All, right, look. Lemme take another statement, and, uh...We'11 look into it,
LISA => You're kidding.
MITCHELL => No. I'll go over it with my sergeant, probably pull this guy in again. Reinterview him. Put a little pressure on him. See what he says.
BONNIE => OK, so we're just gonna start with a_couple of simple stretches.
LISA =>  .Yeah, because the Central Park Conservatory or whatever it's called put up about five hundred miles worth of these cheap shitty-looking fences all over the park. Which is totally antithetical to what the park was originally designed for. She exhales and hands Becky the joint.
BECKY => We are totally gonna miss the game. Oh my God it's John...! It's John! They try to hide the joint from JOHN, the English teacher, who approaches them and stops. Pause.
LISA => Hi John.
BECKY => Hi John.  Want some? They giggle.
JOHN => Come on, guys. You can't be smokin' a j. on your way to a school soccer game! Now come on!
LISA => Sorry.
BECKY => We're really sorry. John glares at them, then turns and walks away.
LISA => Hi, Mr Aaron...!
MR AARON => How are you, Lisa?
LISA => I'm pretty damn good. How are you?
MR AARON => I'm all right, I'm all right-Tell me something. Whatever happened with that situation?
LISA => Oh...I'm working on it. I'll tell you all about it sometime...(squinting at him in the sunshine) Hey, what kind of a bike is that?
MR AARON => Um, a Trek.
LISA => I'm supposed to take a horseback riding trip with my father over Christmas break and I was just wondering, does it bear any resemblance to riding a bicycle?
MR AARON => As far as I know, no, it doesn't, no...
LISA => But you must have ridden a lot of horses.
MR AARON => What makes you say so?
LISA => Aren't you from Texas or Wyoming or someplace like that?
MR AARON => Someplace like what?
- LISA => You know: Not New York.
MR AARON => I'm actually from Indiana. But don't let me overwhelm you with superfluous details.
LISA => God, so what are you doing at a New York private school teaching geometry to a bunch of overprivileged liberal Jews?
MR AARON => Is that a real question, or a Lisa question?
LISA => What's a Lisa question?
MR AARON => A question designed to prolong the conversation without there being any particular interest in the actual answer...?
LISA => About half and half.
MR AARON => In that case --
LISA => Before you go, I am actually thinking of getting one of these. Can I try it? Just for one second?
MR AARON => All right.
LISA => Thanks.
MR AARON => You want me to adjust the seat?
LISA => No thanks. This actually feels really, really good. God, I'm kidding! You are so easy to tease! She bikes away awkwardly, turns around and bikes back toward him, wobbling badly.
LISA => I like your bicycle...! Can I have it?
MR AARON => No! She tries to stop in front of him but skids and he catches her hard by the arms to stop her.
MR AARON => OK. Off.
LISA => Can I just ask you how is it possible that I am totally in love with you and you have almost no interest in me whatsoever? It's not like I'd ever say anything if you ever deigned to like, you know, be with me.
MR AARON => Lisa...!
LISA => I can tell you like me. It's not like I'm a virgin, if that's what you're worried about. I'm not even close.
MR AARON => I can't even be having this conversation with you.
LISA => Yeah, you keep saying that, but I notice you're still standing here.
MR AARON => You're absolutely right. Goodbye. He gets on the bike.
LISA => It's not my fault if I revere you as a god!
LISA => Oh my God. I made you laugh. I am so happy right now.
MR AARON => I'll see you in class. We pull away with him as she watches him go.
JOAN => Hi. Where have you been? I didn't know.if you wanted dinner.
LISA => Oh -- no thanks. I'll order something.
JOAN => Someone named Emily called. And Detective Mitchell called from the Accident Investigation Squad. Is that the one you talked to?
LISA => Yeah, did he say anything?
JOAN => Just to call him back. What's going on? Did you ever go back and see him?
LISA => I'd rather not talk about it when you have one foot out the door. I'll tell you later, if that's OK.
JOAN => Of course it is. Who's Emily?
LISA => She's the friend of the woman who died, the one who had the funeral...
JOAN => Oh yeah, OK. Well, her number's by the phone.
LISA => OK. How's Ramon?
JOAN => Oh God. I don't know. I mean I really like him. He's really nice.
JOAN => But I'm not sure he actually ever understands a word I say.
LISA => Give him a chance, Mom, you just met-the guy.
JOAN => But don't you know what I mean? I just feel kind of lonely when I'm with him. You know?
LISA => You feel lonely when you're with him?
JOAN => Yeah. You never felt that way when you were with someone?
LISA => I guess so. I feel that way all the time. You get used to it.
JOAN => Well ...I don't know how serious I want to get with somebody who makes me feel that way.
LISA => So don't get serious. That's my advice. Pause.
JOAN => All right. I'm gonna go.
LISA => Have a good show.
JOAN => Thank you.  Goodbye Curtis!
JOAN => 'Bye sweetie.
NEIGHBOR => Hello...!
NEIGHBOR => Congratulations on the show...!
JOAN => Thank you.
NEIGHBOR => That was such a wonderful review...! And I read somewhere it might be going to Broadway?
JOAN => Supposedly. In March.
NEIGHBOR => God! Exciting...!
JOAN => Yeah, it's going well. Knock wood.
EMILY => Lisa, Dave is one of my best friends. He's a terrific lawyer and if he doesn't know what to do himself he'll certainly know someone we can talk to.
LISA => OK, great.
EMILY => So Dave, just tell Lisa everything you told me, if you don't mind repeating
DAVE => Not at all. I love to repeat myself.
LISA => Are you guys gonna order something?
DAVE => When someone is killed it's what you call a Wrongful Death Suit, which is a statutory case, which just means there's a statute passed by the legislature which gives you the right to bring the case.
LISA => As opposed to what?
DAVE => As opposed to common law, which is law made by judges. Which is why the damages are limited.
LISA => I don't understand.
EMILY => Look, just skip that part. We don't care about that.
LISA => I thought we were trying to get the police to arrest this guy...!
DAVE => No -- the police are not, uh --
LISA EMILY => Why not? They told me they Dave doesn't think the were gonna look into it police are gonna -- again.
DAVE => I'm just telling you that even if they do, there is no way in this world they are gonna recommend to the DA that they charge this guy. That's why --
DAVE => Well. I'm --
LISA => Sorry.
DAVE EMILY => That's OK -- That's OK, honey...
DAVE => I'm just getting to that. You can't do anything unless you're a relative --
EMILY => She didn't have any relatives, except for those idiots in Arizona --
EMILY => I am the executor of her estate.
DAVE => -- which is Emily. I know.
EMILY => So good.
DAVE => Yes. This is good. Because the executor of the estate Cdn bring a Wrongful Death suit, but the beneficiary has to be a relative. So let me explain about that. In a Wrongful Death suit you can sue for Pain and Suffering, Pecuniary Losses, Lose of Support or Services.. .And also what's called Care, Comfort and Society: --like advice, counseling of the parent that the kids aren't gonna get anymore...
LISA => You can really sue for that?
DAVE => Yeah, and that's probably what we would do,
LISA => So -- I don't understand. Who are we suing? The bus driver?
DAVE => Well, no, because the bus driver wouldn't have any money. You basically sue everybody and hope something sticks. The person who pays will be the MTA's insurance company.
LISA => But do you think the driver would get fired?
DAVE => No. Not necessarily.
LISA => Even if all the facts came out at the trial?
DAVE => Maybe. I don't know.
EMILY => But how much could they be liable for?
DAVE EMILY => It depends: How badly do you think we could ever hurt them?
DAVE => -- if she was alive, in great pain for an extended period of time, they give more money for that.
LISA => I'd say she was alive for ten minutes.
DAVE => And I gather in a lot .of pain?
LISA => Her leg was cut off.
DAVE => Yes -- obviously. And -- but was she conscious? Awake, the whole time?
LISA => I'm sorry, Emily.  Yeah, awake.
EMILY => That's OK.
DAVE => Well, if she was in a lot of pain for that long ...I don't know. . .maybe 300,000 or a half a million dollars to get a sustainable verdict? A brain damaged baby would be three million. But the truth is, Lisa, after all's said and done, it's not a very good case.
LISA => Why not?
DAVE => Because it's your word against his, and because you already lied on your first deposition. A red light case is a fifty- fifty proposition already. And with only one eyewitness, with two conflicting statements? I wouldn't take-that case.
EMILY => Nobody really cares about getting a lot of money here.
DAVE => I understand that --
EMILY => We just want this prick to Buffer. and we want the bus company to take resonsibility for hiring this guy.
DAVE => I understand. But no matter how you slice it, the fact that Lisa lied on her first statement is a disaster for your lawyer.
LISA => Can't I explain why I lied the first time? It's not like I'm trying to get any money for myself.
DAVE => That's true-Since she have no financial interest she can't be impeached for bias.
EMILY => Impeached for what?
DAVE => She can't have her credibility attacked on financial grounds because the jury knows you're not getting any money if you win.
LISA => So that's'something, isn't it?
EMILY => But do you really think we know what that means?
DAVE => I'm sorry. That's what its called.
EMILY => But who are you talking to? You know we don't know what that means. It's like you're not really concentrating.
DAVE => I -- don't know. I am concentrating. I'm just thinking out loud.
EMILY => OX. All right. I'm sorry...I
EMILY => He wasn't always a lawyer you know. He used to be a very nice little boy.
DAVE => Anyway.. the only thing I could think of is it i@ the MTA. So they're not gonna want a lot of publicity.
LISA => Anyway, the whole point is to get this guy --
EMILY => Is to fucking get this guyl
LISA => No, its to get him out from behind the wheel of a bus!
DAVE => Did she know she was dying? I only ask because the terror of knowing you're dying raises the damages.
LISA => I think she had a pretty good idea.
DAVE => If she had lived for a couple of days it would make the case better...I know this sounds horrible, but this is what it comes down to...
EMILY => I know. We know, Dave. That's OK. Silence. Emily starts to speak:
DAVE => I actually did have one more thought...I do know one guy who's, uh... You know what? Yo know what I want to do7 I want to make a few phone calls, and then, just let me get back to you.
EMILY => I would just like somebody to take responsibility for what happened.
LISA => Yes, Detective Mitchell please? . My name is Lisa Cohen? C 0 H -- Yes, I'll hold. Fuck you...
MITCHELL => Detective Mitchell.
LISA => Oh, hi, it's Lisa Cohen calling.
MITCHELL => Hi Lisa, what can I do for you?
LISA => Well, I was just wondering what ever happened, if anything, with the case. You said you might re-interview the bus driver...
LISA => You did? What happened?
MITCHELL => Well, he basically stuck to his original representation, and that was pretty much it. I brought it up with my sergeant, but he agrees with me we still don't have enough to charge this guy, so there's really not a lot more we can do at this point.
LISA => But how did you ask the questions?
MITCHELL => Excuse me?
LISA => He's obviously not gonna change his
MITCHELL => Hey, you know, Lisa, in the old days we'd just throw him in the back with a rubber hose and we'd get whatever answer we want out of him. But fortunately we don't do that kind of thing anymore --
LISA => Yeah, not to white people.
MITCHELL => Excuse me?
LISA => You don't do it to white people. Anyway, I'm not saying you --
MITCHELL => We don't do it to who?
LISA => Oh my God...
MITCHELL => First of all, I don't know why you're bringin' the guy's race into it. There's forty thousand cops in this city --
LISA => Yes, thank you, yes.
MITCHELL => -- and I hate to disillusion you, but most of 'em are pretty good guys, just tryin' to do their job. Bottom line is the DA's not gonna take this case.  Now you could talk to my sergeant if you want to, but --
LISA => Yes, I would.
LISA => So there's no way to appeal --
SERGEANT =>  There's nothin' to appeal. There's no case.
LISA => But how do you know Detective Mitchell interrogated him aggressively enough if you weren't there?
JOAN => What's going on? LISA waves her away.
JOAN => -- so funny: it's the same show, but now they all read how great it is, we get these big standing ovations every night, and it's the exact same show as before.
RAMON => But why do you put yourself down? It's a wonderful show and a wonderful performance.
JOAN => No, it's not -- I'm not putting myself down. It's just that the audience always reacts differently if they've been told it's good. A lot of actors have that experience.
RAMON => Mm hm? She takes a few steps away.
JOAN => I love this view... You know, Ramon...this may sound very stupid to you, but do you ever worry that we don't have very much in common?
RAMON => What do you mean?
JOAN => Well, I don't mean to sound dissatisfied, or disgruntled. But I feel like we're always misunderstanding each other. Do you feel that way at all? Or am I just completely off the beam?
RAMON => I don't think we should talk about that, Joan.
JOAN => You don't? Well...I think it's kind of important or I wouldn't have brought it up.
RAMON => Joan... I like you very much. But let's not talk about what you are like, and what I am like. That never makes a good result. Talk about it with your friends.
JOAN => My friends...!
RAMON => Yes.
RAMON => May I show you some pictures of my boys?
JOAN => Sure. Just don't tell me what they're like.
RAMON => That's a little place we used to go on holiday, two hours outside of Cartagena...My family is all there still, but Rodrigo is studying in London, and Hector is in Geneva.
JOAN => Uh huh...
RAMON => I'm sure they will go back eventually, because they like to do something for their country. But it's a worry, because it's very bad there now.
JOAN => Yeah...I haven't really been following it.
RAMON => It's a big, big mess. Last year I helped to found an organization to work with children whose families have been killed, or the parents have been kidnapped, so they don't know if they are alive or dead. We try to find homes for them, preferably in Colombia, because if we lose our young people, that's it: That's the future. We have raised a lot of money, but there's only so much we can do. You don't like to say it's hopeless, but it's hard to see the solution.
JOAN => Yeah. God...I wish I knew more about it...Do you mind if I ask you something?
RAMON => Of course not.
JOAN => Why are you interested in me?
RAMON => You don't think I should be?
JOAN => I just feel kind of ignorant about your whole world...
RAMON => You think it would be better if we knew about all the same things?
JOAN => Not really, not exclusively. It's just unusual. Don't you think it's unusual?
RAMON => Not for me.
JOAN => I guess you travel a lot. I've only been out of the country a few times in my whole life.
RAMON => You should travel more.
JOAN => I know. I've always wanted to. It's hard when you're in the theater...
RAMON => Still, you should try. It's a big world. You're an artist. You should see more of it.
JOAN => I know. You don't have to keep saying that. I've always wanted to travel. It's just a little difficult with two kids and no husband, but it's hard to make a lot of money in the theater. I was on a TV show a few years back and I socked away some money because of that, but my ex-husband --
RAMON => Karl.
JOAN => Karl, yes, you remembered, very good. Karl's very generous with the kids when he can be, but he's struggling too: He's a director: he directs commercials, and now he's trying to produce them... Anyway, I'm not ignorant because I enjoy it.
RAMON => I don't say you're ignorant... Do you think Lisa will be interested in acting?
JOAN => I don't think so. I think's she's got a lot of contempt for it. Of course that may be the age.
RAMON => She would prefer the world with no plays? No films?
JOAN => Oh... Who knows.
RAMON => Would you like to see a picture of my mother?
JOAN => Sure.
RAMON => These are all my aunts and uncles...See? Big family...
JOAN => Mmm. She looks at him as he turns the pages.
DAVE => So after I talked to you guys I called this P.I. I know and I asked him to --
EMILY => You called a what? A what?
DAVE => Private Investigator -- to see if he could find anything out about your bus driver --
LISA => Really?
DAVE EMILY => Yeah: So he -- Dave!
DAVE => Wait, let me tell you what he said! So he called this guy he knows who used to be a cop for the MTA. Did you know the MTA have their own police? The MTA police? They have their own uniforms...
EMILY => Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
DAVE EMILY => And -- Just a minutel Jesus Christ! What do we give a fuck about the MTA police and their uniforms?!
DAVE => -- so this guy got someone to let him sneak a look at your guy's file. And it turns out he's had two previous accidents -- less than two years apart -- one of them on the job, one in his own car --
EMILY => What?
DAVE => -- where there was some allegation that he was drinking, which was dropped, but, that he's never been cited or disciplined, just moved around to different shifts --
EMILY => Are you fucking kidding me?
LISA => Why does this not shock me?
DAVE => Because Surprise Surprise his brother-in- law is a very big muckety-muck in the Transit Workers Union --
EMILY =>  O-Kay...l
DAVE => And if you read the paper, you'll know they're going through a protracted labor dispute at the MTA right now, and according to my PI, the management doesn't want to aggravate the situation by firing this guy. Especially since the police have concluded he was not at fault.
LISA => This is making me sick.
DAVE => I know, but what it means, Lisa, is that we have a case.
LISA => We do?
DAVE => What it means, in fact, is that we have a very good case, because we can sue for what's called "Negligent Retention." Which means they should have known the guy was a bad risk and was irresponsible and they negligently retained him until he finally killed somebody.
EMILY => And you can prove that?
DAVE => Sure, because we can subpoena their Personnel records, which we already know contain damaging information, because my investigator got a look at them beforehand. Which you're not-supposed to do, but we did it anyway.
EMILY => And that means...
DAVE => That means we're in great shape and I think we should go in there and sue their fuckin' asses off.
EMILY => But you wouldn't be our lawyer, right?
DAVE => No no. Oh no.
LISA => Why not?
DAVE EMILY => I'm not a personal injury It's not his area. litigator. I don't know enough about it. I would lose.
EMILY => But you could recommend someone?
DAVE => Sure. I know a guy who's very good. His name is Russel Deutsch. He's not a sleazebag. Very experienced. Let me give you his number...
EMILY => Dave, thank you so much.
LISA => Really. My God.
DAVE => But you gotta get that crazy cousin on board because she's gonna be your beneficiary.
EMILY => She's not gonna want to come to New York, I can tell you that right now.
DAVE => If you win she gets anywhere from three to five hundred thousand dollars. She's gonna come to New York.
LISA => What's with Monica and her cousin?
EMILY => Oh, Monica's father left some money to Abigail's kids and he made Monica the executor of the estate, because he didn't want Abigail and her idiot husband to get their hands on the money before the kids were grown up.
EMILY => For which Abigail rewarded her by badgering her about it on the phone for fifteen years: Always trying to borrow money against the estate, accusing her of making lousy investments with it, nasty phone calls, nasty letters, every month for fifteen years until Abigail's daughter turned twenty-one and got married. Then Monica goes to the wedding, in fucking Arizona, and Abigail literally won't speak to her. She's a dream.
LISA => So that's who we're getting the money for?
EMILY => It's not who we're getting it for, it's who we're getting it from.
DEUTSCH => First thing we do is we file a summons and a complaint against the MTA. They get .twenty days to respond, and when they do we can make our Discovery requests: Accident reports, personnel records, et cetera. But you gotta realize it's gonna take some time. The law says you have to get a court date within a year. Usually it takes about six. Depending.
LISA => Six years!
DEUTSCH => Depending, yes.
EMILY => Now, I mentioned to Dave I have a friend who writes for the Metro section of the Times...
DEUTSCH => Yes: Now this, if it could really happen, this changes everything in our favor. If they think there's gonna be adverse publicity, especially in The New York Times, they're gonna want to settle right away, soon as possible, and as quietly as
EMILY => So they'd.make it a condition that
DEUTSCH => It's usually done, you get the money but you can't talk about it. Nobody knows the terms.
LISA => So what good does that do?
DEUTSCH => You get the money.  is that bad? I thought that's what we're all here for.  This is how our society punishes people for doing bad things.
LISA => By getting money from their employers' insurance. companies?
DEUTSCH => Yes. It's called Punitive Damages. Pause.
LISA => Could we insist they fire the driver? As part of the settlement?
DEUTSCH => Yes, sure, why not?
LISA => But is that something people do?
DEUTSCH => Sure. It's one of your conditions.
EMILY => Great.
LISA => And you think we're gonna win? They're gonna settle?
DEUTSCH => Oh they're gonna settle.
LISA => This is -- Emily and Lisa take hands and squeeze.
JOAN => I want to talk to you.
LISA => What'd I do now?
JOAN => Hi. I'm Joan. It's nice to meet you.
EMILY => Nice to meet you too. Come on in.
JOAN => .I had a friend who used to live on this block, at 262...?
EMILY => Oh...?
JOAN => Yeah, I don't know if you know her. Cheryl Rowan? She's a physiotherapist?
EMILY => No, I don't know her.
LISA => I think about a thousand people must...
JOAN => What?
LISA => Nothing...
EMILY => Lisa says you're in a play, Joan?
JOAN => Oh -- Yeah...
LISA => You should go see it, it's really good.
JOAN => Well, the play is great, and it's a really nice cast..-.
LISA => She's just being modest. She's gonna win every award in New York.
JOAN => Oh -- all that stuff's a long way off.
EMILY => I don't go to the theater very much.
JOAN => Well, it's just nice, because you can work a long time in the theater and play really good parts without getting a lot of recognition. And even though you don't necessarily do it for that as your primary motive, it is very nice when people do notice something you've done.
EMILY => Uh huh...
JOAN => I was on a television show a few years ago, and I had been doing theater all my life, and suddenly all my relatives started calling me up to congratulate me because they thought I finally Made It. And it was really just this dumb show that paid the bills for a while...
LISA => That show was so stupid.
JOAN => It wasn't that bad...! Anyway: I realize this is horribly embarrassing for Lisa, but I really wanted to meet you, Emily, because you've frankly become such a big part of Lisa's life, and I don't want to be intrusive, but this whole court case seems to be suddenly dominating everything and I can't get Lisa to tell me anything about it
LISA => That's not true...!
JOAN => Well, I can't...! And I want you to know, Lisa, that I'm very, very proud of you for pursuing this the way you have.
JOAN => But I can't let you pursue it to the point where it's taking over your life or interfering with your school work. (To EMILY) It's really come down to a question of homework. Lisa is on a half-scholarship at her school. And I know she feels a real sense of responsibility about what happened
LISA => Yeah, I do.
JOAN => I know you do. I know you do. But you can't not do your homework, and you can't throw away your scholarship because of it.
LISA => I'm not. My grades slipped a little. They'll get better. Anyone can do their homework. You just sit down and do it. I've been distracted. I'll stop.
JOAN => All right --
LISA => We didn't need to have a big conference about it.
EMILY => Don't apologize. If Lisa hasn't been keeping you apprised of what's been going on, I think she should. You should.
LISA => There's nothing to keep her apprised of., We're just waiting for them to schedule the Discovery conference.
JOAN => Now what is that?
LISA => Mom? It really doesn't matter.
EMILY => A Discovery conference is a meeting with the court where they sign an order. authorizing our lawyer to begin getting the personnel records, interviewing witnesses, talking to Monica's cousin...
JOAN => OK, now where does she fit in?
EMILY => She gets the money.
DEUTSCH => How would you describe the relationship overall? Did you talk on the phone a lot? Were there a lot of visits --
ABIGAIL => I would say we talked on the phone a couple of times a month at least. Sometimes more than that...I would call her, she would call me...
DEUTSCH => And what were the nature of these conversations?
ABIGAIL. => Oh, family stuff, mostly. Her family, my kids...
DEUTSCH => And she would advise you about your family? That kind of thing?
ABIGAIL => Oh, I would say so, yes.
DEUTSCH => Would you have any phone records? Or --
ABIGAIL => I have all my phone bills, if that's what you mean. I didn't record the actual conversations...
DEUTSCH => No no --
DEUTSCH => OK, that's terrific. I see you came prepared...1
ABIGAIL => Well, I wanted to bring everything.
DEUTSCH => Now when they take your deposition you're gonna say the same thing you just told me. Talk about the relationship...
ABIGAIL => Uh huh?
DEUTSCH => Kind of advice she used to give you...
ABIGAIL => Now, Emily, where did you find this lawyer?
EMILY => He was recommended by a friend.
ABIGAIL => I'm asking because my husband knows a real good New York lawyer, and I'm not entirely comfortable with someone that no one has ever heard of --
EMILY => My friend's heard of him. He says he's very good..
ABIGAIL => I'm sure he does. But I have a responsibility in this situation, and I would feel a whole lot more comfortable with somebody who didn't just drop in out of the clear blue sky...
EMILY => He didn't drop in out of the clear blue sky. He was recommended by my friend. But even if we switched lawyers we'd still have to pay him. But it all comes out of the settlement, so it's really up to you.
ABIGAIL => No, if you all think he's good...
EMILY => I don't know whether he is or not. My friend thinks he is.
ABIGAIL => All right. Now Lisa, what is your involvement in all this? What's your angle?
LISA => I just wanted to...I was just there.
LISA => Oh my God, is that you?
LISA => God... So how old was she when she died?
LISA => God. I can't even imagine.
EMILY => Neither could we.
LISA => You know Monica asked about her when she was dying?
EMILY => No. I didn't.
EMILY => What do you mean? What did she say?
LISA => She just asked if somebody could call her daughter. But then it got confusing because I said, "Sure, what's her name?" And she said her name was Lisa. And I said, "No, that's my name." Because it took me a minute -- I didn't realize we had the same name... Emily does not respond.
LISA => But I couldn't tell if what I was saying
LISA => But then when I found out her daughter was dead, ever since then I keep having this really strong feeling that some way, for those last five minutes I kind of was her daughter. You know? Like maybe that's the reason I was there: Like in some weird way, this obviously amazing woman got to see her daughter again for a few minutes, right before she died.
LISA => I didn't mean she ws literally inhabiting my body. I don't believe in all that stuff at all.
LISA => Oh my God! Why are you so mad at me!?
EMILY => Because this is not an opera!
EMILY => Yes!
LISA => You think I'm making this into a dramatic situation because I think it's dramatic?!?
EMILY => I think you're very young.
LISA => What does that have to do with anything? If anything I think it means I care more than someone who's older! Because this kind of thing has never happened to me before!
EMILY => No, it means you care more easily! There's a big difference! Except that it's not you it's happening to!
LISA => Yes it is! I know I'm not the one who was run over --
EMILY => That's right, you weren't. And you're not the one who died of leukemia, and you're not the one who just died in an earthquake in -- Algeria! But you will be. Do you understand me? You will be. And it's not an opera and it's not dramatic --
LISA => I'm well aware of that!
EMILY => And this first-blush phony deepness of yours is worth nothing.
LISA => Oh wow.
EMILY => Do you understand? It's not worth anything, because it'll be troweled over in a month or two. And then when you get older, and you don't have a big reaction every time a d gets run over, then, then we'll find out what kind of a person you are! But this is nothing! I'm sorry, but I didn't start this conversation and I don't play these games.
LISA =>  I am not --
EMILY => And don't look so outraged! Because I'm not
LISA => Oh my God!
EMILY => But this is nm life we're talking about, much more than it is yours! Because it's my real friend who got killed, who I'm never going to see again, really! Whom I have known since I was nineteen years old myself. OK? And I don't want that sucked into some kind of adolescent self- dramatization!
LISA => I'm not fucking dramatizing anything!
EMILY => 
LISA => I was there, and you weren't! And if I happen to express myself a little hyperbolically, Emily, that's just the way I talk! I can't help it if my mother is an actress! Why are you being so fucking strident?
EMILY => Strident?
LISA => Yeah.
EMILY => OK. Um, you should leave.
LISA => Why? Because I called you strident?
EMILY => Yeah: Strident? You should leave. Thanks. I don't wanna be called strident and you're deliberately misunderstanding me!
LISA => No I'm not! You're insulting me enough as it is: You don't have to call me stupid too!
EMILY => Well I can't stop you doing this so I think you had better go.
LISA => OK! I will.
LISA => OK! Let me get my purse! Lisa grabs her purse and coat. Emily half-walks, half-drives her toward the door.
LISA => Does this mean we're dropping the whole inquiry?
EMILY => It means you're leaving. I don't know what else it means.
LISA => All I meant by saying you were strident was that you were being emphatic! I obviously misused the word!
EMILY => Look it up when you get home.
LISA => Jesus Christ. You're amazing.
EMILY => Yeah. Uh huh. I'm amazing.
LISA =>  Why are you doing this... .!
EMILY => Lisa, I'm not doing anything! I'm a human being! Monica was a human being! So was her daughter! And so is your mother!
EMILY => We are not supporting characters in the fascinating story of your life!
LISA => I never said or thought you were...! And I really didn't mean to call you strident! I
LISA => But I'm not trying to dramatize anything, Emily. I really know about that trend, and I really don't think I've been doing that.
LISA => I will. They kiss and make up, but it's still a little ugly.
JOAN => I've been in the theater my whole life and nothing like this has ever happened to me...
JOAN => Oh God. Joan buries her face in her hands. Lisa watches scowling.
JOAN => Lisa? Do you think Emily would like to come see the play? I thought you could both come and them maybe we could go out afterwards.
LISA => All right. Let me ask her.
JOAN => Dig in everybody... They start eating.
LISA => I was thinking about spending next year with Dad.
LISA => Yeah. You're all worried about my grades. They have really good public schools in Santa Monica, and if Iofficially lived with him, you wouldn't have to worry about my scholarship.
JOAN => Have you talked to him about this?
LISA => We've had some general discussions.
JOAN => Yeah. Do you want to move to LA too?
CURTIS => No.
JOAN => Well, just let me know if you do.
LISA => Why are you being like this?
JOAN => Why am I being like what?
LISA => Why are you about to start crying?
JOAN => Because it's your intention to make me start crying!
LISA => No it's not --
- JOAN => You want to move to LA. Move to LA.
LISA => But why can't this even be mentioned without you taking it personally? I'm just introducing a possibility!
OH! => Joan upsets everything on the table and starts to go. She comes back and upsets more things on the table.
JOAN => Here's a possibility that you can make your own fucking dinner! Here's a possibility LISA that you can do whatever you Jesus Christ! want to do, because I don't What is with you? even care anymore, you heartless little fuckin' bitch!
LISA => Fine! Keep it up! It really makes me want to stay here!
JOAN => You think you're so fucking perfect!? She breaks something else and walks out.
LISA => No.
CURTIS => Good one.
LISA => Shut up.
KLEIN => OK. Go ahead: Kirsten. Lionel: Put your drum away. Lionel stops drumming on his desk with his fingers.
KIRSTEN => I think that teenagers should definitely rule the world, because teenagers aren't corrupted by adult life yet, and they're idealists and they care. And I know a lot of people feel that teenagers are really naive, which they are, many of them. But they still haven't had a chance to get burned out by the disappointments and the harsh realities of learning how to play the game. So yes, I would vote yes.
KLEIN => All right: Lisa?
LISA => I would tend to agree with all of that, except I do think that teenagers don't always necessarily think things through very carefully, and they don't have enough experience to know what the right thing to do is all the time. I also think they tend to adhere to ideologies really easily without having actually bothered to think them through for themselves.--
LEWIS => Such as what?
LISA => Such as what? Such as, gee, I don't know: the Hitler Youth?
KLEIN => OK... Hitler Youth.
LISA => Or what about all these teenage suicide bombers? Not that I want to get into the whole Palestinian thing again, but assuming you don't think suicide bombing is a good thing, wouldn't you say that's an example of being idealistic without using your critical faculties?
LISA => And maybe running the risk of having your youthful enthusiasm be co-opted by adults for purposes of their own that you might not even ultimately agree with? Angie's hand shoots up. So do several others.
LEWIS => OK, Angie?
ANGIE => Yeah, I don't want to get into the whole Palestinian thing again either, because I realize I'm completely outnumbered --
ANTHONY => Not unlike the Palestinians themselves.
ANGIE => That's not really funny, Anthony. ANGIE  KLEIN -- and I'm not even going to Segal: Cut the comedy. comment on the fact that you just compared a 19-year-old ANTHONY Palestinian to a member of I thought it was funny... the Hitler Youth, which I personally find so offensive LISA I don't even know where to That's right! Because start -- Oh, it's not because they both like to kill they've been occupied and Jews. humiliated and bombed out of their homes for the last KLEIN fifty years? Hey! Hey! Lisa! Hey!
LEWIS LISA => Come on, guys... Yes! That's partly why they like it! There's ANGIE still a million Pale- If anyone's acting like stinians who don't blow Nazis it's the Israeli up children on busses government! because they're so "frustrated!"
LEWIS => OK, OK! Monica?
MONICA => Well, I don't know if this is good or bad, but speaking of ideology, it's interesting that the suicide bombers -- just for example -- care enough about what they believe in to sacrifice their lives for it.
ANGIE => Yes. Yes!
LISA => I think it's fine if you want to sacrifice your life for what you believe in. I actually think that's really noble. It's a little different when you're willing to sacrifice someone else's life, you know? I personally don't think that's such a big ideological achievement!
ANGIE => Um, even if there's no other way to get you out of my country?
LEWIS LISA => Raise your hands! They haven't tried any other ways! It's not ANGIE like killing civilians Yes they have! They're is their last resort! trying it right now! It's their first resort! Because it's easy and they like it!
ANGIE => Oh they like it? They're just bad people and they like it?
LISA => Yes! There are bad people in the world! I think they liked blowing up the World Trade Center! They kill their own sisters when they get raped! It's called barbarism!
MONICA LISA => Who kills their own sisters? It's practically all people do is kill each other! LIONEL If they didn't like it they You guys are not the only wouldn't do it! Period! ones in this class!
LEWIS => If you ladies can't make your points without yelling or interrupting each other or raising your hands, I'd say it was a pretty good argument for "No."
LISA => Why, adults don't yell and interrupt each other?
LEWIS => Lisa!
LISA => Sorry.
LEWIS => Let's try to put this in a broader perspective. The question was not actually who's to blame in the Arab Israeli conflict
ANGIE => The Israelis.
LISA => OK, you're a moron.
LEWIS =>  Lisa!
ANGIE KLEIN => You're not even Jewish, Lisa! The next Goddamn person who opens their mouth without LISA raising their hand is. I'm fuckin' half-Jewish, and outta this class! who cares what I am? I'm anti- murder, not pro-Israel. LEWIS Lisa? Lisa? You can leave!
LISA => Fine. Thank you. Lisa passes the blackboard, grabs some chalk and checks "NO. "
LISA => By the way, she just proved my point.
ANGIE LEWIS => No I didn't. Lisa, GO! Lisa leaves. Lewis turns to the class.
NOW => An O.C. burst of APPLAUSE takes us to --
RAMON => That's the best show yet! Every time it's a better performance.
JOAN => God, thank you! Hi, Emily, thanks so much for coming...
EMILY => Oh, thank you for the tickets. Pause. Joan waits for Emily or Lisa to say something nice.
JOAN => Shall we go?
LISA => -- and I guess I lost my cool a little, but I just love it'when people start comparing the Israelis to Nazis...
JOAN => But who is running these discussions...?
RAMON => Well, but Lisa, you have to remember, it's always easy for the dominant side to be content with the status quo.
JOAN => Mmm.
- EMILY => How do you mean, Ramon?
RAMON => I mean the oppressor is always in favor of law and order because it's his law and his order. He uses violence to maintain his position and calls it the rule of law. But when the person underfoot uses violence to change his status he's called a criminal and a terrorist, and the violence of the State is called upon to put him down, and once again it's called the rule of law. In
EMILY => I see. And what would you like them to do? Pause.
RAMON => "They" meaning --
EMILY => The Jew oppressors. What would you like them to do? Pause.
RAMON => I didn't use that expression. EMILY But since you ask - No, you didn't. (i.e. "You didn't have to.")
LISA => Um, I just spent the whole day arguing about this: I didn't really mean to bring it up again.
EMILY =>  Don't handle me.
LISA => I'm not handling you.
RAMON LISA => And I think it's ironic in Don't bother, Mom.
LISA =>  That's what I think! Emily tries to unhook her purse from the back of her chair.
JOAN => That seems excessive, Emily, come on --
RAMON => That's the response. That's the Jewish response.
EMILY => It's the what?
RAMON => It's the Jewish response. You don't like what I am saying or what I do, so you --
EMILY => That's my Jewish response. Emily throws her drink in his face and walks away.
JOAN => Oh my God...!
RAMON => It's all right... That's all right... It's a perfect little .encapsule...It's the Jewish response. A horrible silence as they watch Ramon clean his shirt.
LISA => Sorry about all that tonight.
JOAN => Yeah. Your friend is a delight.
LISA => She's a really passionate person. She really cares about things.
JOAN => She's rude, Lisa. Ramon was my guest, not hers. And-so.was she, as a matter of fact --
LISA => So what? Why is it so JOAN important that people be No -- I'm not ar -- I'm polite all the time? Why not arguing about this with is that the big priority? you! I'm not interested in an exchange of ideas. As it happens Ramon said a few things I wasn't too crazy about either, so I guess that's the end of that...
LISA => Oh is that supposed to be Emily's fault too?
JOAN => I don't want to talk to you right now. Please go away.
RAMON =>  Joan, I won't defend myself. All what I
LISA => Well...? How's that anti-Semitic piece of shit Ramon?-
JOAN => Oh God, I don't know. The PHONE RINGS. Lisa picks up.
LISA => Hello?
LISA => Hi, Dad, how are you? I'm really looking forward to our horseback riding trip...
KARL => Yeah. That's why I'm calling. I don't think it's going to happen.
LISA => Really? What's the matter?
KARL => Nothing's the matter. Nobody seems to really want to go, and I don't really feel like spending three thousand bucks on something nobody has the slightest interest in. So I think it's obviously better for everyone if we just cancel.
LISA => I never said I didn't want to go.
KARL => Well, I can't seem to get a straight answer about what anybody wants to eat, um, Annette is giving me a hard time about her schedule, I talk to Curtis and all I get are monosyllables, so --
LISA => I think-he's really looking forward to it --
KARL => Uh huh? Well, you know, that hasn't really been my impression. So, uh...I also think it would be good to shelve the idea of your coming out here next year.
KARL => It looks like things are gonna start picking up for me in the Fall, which means I'm probably not gonna be around the house all that much, and since you and Annette detest each other, I don't, uh, I don't think that's what I want to come home to after a fourteen hour day.
LISA => We don't detest each other
KARL => OK, well, it doesn't really strike me as something you're that serious about anyway, so what do you say we just table it for the time being?
KARL => OK. So tell Curtis, uh, that New Mexico's off...Ummm, and I will talk to you, ummm, whenever.
KARL => Yeah. He hangs up. LISA hangs up too.
JOAN => What's wrong?
LISA => Dad's cancelling the trip.
JOAN => What? Why?
LISA => He's says nobody wants to go and he doesn't want to spend the money.
JOAN => Did you say you didn't want to go?
LISA => No, I know there was some problem with Annette about arranging for food because I don't eat dead animals, but.I didn't think it was.going to wreck the whole trip.
JOAN => Oh boy.
LISA => I thought you said it sounded like it was going to be a disaster. Personally I'm relieved. I'm not moving out there, either, by the way, obviously. Which is fine too.
LISA => Thank you for letting me come up. I don't know who else to talk to. She's talking to MR AARON, who looks very uncomfortable.
MR AARON => That's all right...
LISA => You've always been very sympathetic to my craziness, and I may not show it all the time, but I actually really appreciate it.
MR AARON => It's no problem, Lisa. What's been going on?
LISA => I just need to talk to somebody who doesn't completely misunderstand who Iam. Or not even who I am, but what's going on inside me, or all around me. Sound confused enough? Anyway, for whatever reason, I always felt like we understood each other on some level, even though I'm like a mass of conflicting impulses and you're basically the most grown-up, rational man I know.
MR AARON => Well...I doubt that's actually true but thank you...
LISA => You seem pretty fuckin' rational to me. Like that seems to be your leading feature. I mean you obviously have a lot of pretty deep feelings...So when you're rational - just to finish my thought -- it's like this really interesting way of governing yourself.
LISA => And you don't have to get all uncomfortable again: I'm not talking about what you think I'm talking about, because I know that subject is-off-limits. I'm talking about your soul, I guess, and how you feel you have to keep it in check all the time by being sensible. Do you know what I'm saying at all?
MR AARON => Well...We all have feelings, Lisa. I happen to believe that who you are comes out of how you deal with those feelings. Somebody makes you mad, you don't just pick up a gun and shoot them...Or if you do, that says something about who you are, and how you've been raised...
LISA => Well, I don't want to disillusion you, but we happen to be living in a world where that is what people do. More often than not.
MR AARON => That's not true, Lisa. I think it's very sad that you see it that way. There's eight billion people alive in the world and you think they don't all want to kill someone once in a while? But they don't. Most of them. Or they see some person they --  I think most people do try to be civilized by some standard. Even if it's a standard you and I might not agree with...
LISA => No, I get it. That's actually the most hopeful thing anybody's said to me for a long time. I don't know why I take such a dire view of things, I really don't. She removes her jacket. She's wearing a small clingy T-shirt.
LISA => Just a little hot...A little warm .Is this all right?
MR AARON => Sure.
LISA => Do you allow smoking in your apartment?
MR AARON => You can smoke. She gets her cigarettes out and lights one. He gets up and brings her an ashtray. They meet at the sofa and sit.
LISA => I like your apartment.
MR AARON => Thank you. She blows some smoke out and waves it away.
LISA => Sorry.
MR AARON => That's all right.
LISA => This is terrible.
MR AARON => What is? What's terrible?
LISA => I just like you so much...(Smooths her ash on the ashtray.) Sorry. What a moron.
MR AARON =>  Hey. Lisa. I'm your friend. And that's not gonna change. That's not gonna change.
LISA => Thanks. Thank you. She kisses his hand a couple of times.
MR AARON => Lisa...
LISA => Please just let me for a second. I like you so much. I like you so, so much. She kisses his hand more elaborately. He lets this go on. She lifts her head up and they kiss for real. After a moment she slides her hand onto his leg.
MR AARON => OK, look...
LISA => Don't stop me yet, OK? They kiss some more. She bends down to unzip his fly.
MR AARON => Please don't do that.
LISA => Just let me for one second... She bends her head over his lap. He lets her.
MR AARON => Are you all right?
LISA => Nothing. It's OK.
LISA => Don't stop. It's OK.
MR AARON => Are you all right?
LISA => Yes, yes, you don't have to keep asking me that.
MR AARON => I think we should stop.
LISA => No, keep going...! She keeps pushing against him.
LISA => All I can say is I better get a pretty fuckin' good grade in geometry this year. Lighten up! I'm kidding.
MR AARON => Sorry. I really didn't expect anything like this to happen. I'm really not sure how to react.
LISA => Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I totally initiated the whole thing.
LISA => Anyway, it's just sex. You're acting like a little kid. I'll see you in school. She walks out. He is very flummoxed.
DEUTSCH => Well, they want to settle.
DEUTSCH => I have a meeting with their lawyer this afternoon, and they want to discuss a settlement. So we should get Abigail on the phone and talk about what-we're gonna do.
EMILY => Fantastic. Lisa gets tears in her eyes and smiles, embarrassed.
LISA => Sorry.
EMILY => That's OK.
ABIGAIL => Mr Deutsch? Mr --
DEUTSCH ROB => I'm right here. I just had the thought --
ABIGAIL => Mr Deutsch -- I'm just gonna give my husband the floor because he had a few
ROB => Mr Deutsch, I had the thought, if they're willing to settle so quickly, maybe we're better off waiting a little bit, maybe rattling the sabre a little bit more...
ABIGAIL => Yes, if they're so quick to agree to a settlement on this basis --
DEUTSCH => What you gotta realize -- What you gotta
EMILY => Abigail, Russel doesn't think -- Sorry, go
EMILY => My friend had a lot of trouble getting the one story placed in the paper as it is --
DEUTSCH => .Could I interject?
ABIGAIL => But if they responded so strongly based on one story...
ROB => Maybe we're cuttin' our own throats here.
DEUTSCH => They are responding to the story in the paper...
ABIGAIL => .That's just common sense.
DEUTSCH => But what you gotta understand is they're offering to settle now because they want to get the story out of the paper.
EMILY LISA => That's why Russel thinks -- Besides, the main point is not to jack up the price.
ABIGAIL => I'm sorry --
ROB => -- We didn't hear that last.
DEUTSCH =>  Ladies, let me just -- Abigail. Rob.
DEUTSCH => If I could finish my thought -- They're jumpin' at the bait right now, but if another six months goes by we run a serious risk of losing our momentum. You see what I mean? Now I'm gonna hit 'em very very hard, I guarantee you. That's why I wanted all of us together on the phone, so we could talk about your other terms, besides the
ABIGAIL => What other terms would there be?
ROB => What do you mean, like some kind of a fund?
DEUTSCH => A what?
DEUTSCH => I don't understand what you mean by a fund...
ROB ABIGAIL => Mr. Deutsch? Do you mean What does he mean, "besides some kind of trust fund, the damages?" a fund that would be set up by the bus company for EMILY our kids? For tax purposes? What fuckin' fund?
LISA => These people are retarded.
ABIGAIL => Because I have to tell you we have just lived through that nightmare with Monica and our children, and it was not a pleasant experience. We just want a clean, straight damages is fine. A regular payment. We'll pay the taxes on it. At least we'll have something in our hand...
DEUSTCH => I don't really know what kind of fund you're talking about...
LISA => We're not talking about -- Hi, this is Lisa? We're ABIGAIL talking -- We're talking Hello, Lisa. about -- Hello?
ABIGAIL => We're still here.
LISA => We're talking about the driver, getting the driver fired --
ABIGAIL => Oh, yes --
LISA => -- as part of the conditions.
EMILY => Yes, Abigail, it's very important to us that the company know that's an absolute pre-condition to making any kind of settlement whatsoever.
ABIGAIL => Oh yes. Absolutely. If you think he's at
ROB => Just as long as they don't think they can buy us off just by gettin' rid of this guy. You see what I mean?
DEUTSCH => Absolutely.
ROB => What we're most concerned about here is the amount.
EMILY => Yes, we're getting that, Rob.
ROB => But you see what I mean?
DEUTSCH => Yes -- Rob? Yes I do.
ROB => I just want to go on record as saying I think this whole meeting is premature.
ABIGAIL => Absolutely. We're not lawyers --
DEUTSCH => Abigail? Rob? I just wanna make something clear. One conversation does not commit you to anything.
DEUTSCH => And I'm not gonna agree to anything without consulting you. But I'm working for you.
DEUTSCH => So if you're telling me not to take the meeting I'm not gonna take the meeting.
JOAN => Lisa, I'm really proud of you!
LISA => Thank you.
JOAN => Really, really proud...!
LISA => Thank you. Pause. Joan gets to her feet and starts tidying up.
LISA => Are you upset about something...?
JOAN => No. This house is really beginning to get to me. And I'm a little confused what to do about Ramon. I mean, you were there: What do you think?
LISA => Uh, gee, Mom maybe you should really think about it some more. Because it would probably hurt Ramon's feelings if you broke up with him and I think you better think about it before you do something like that to him.
JOAN => I know I'm supposed to understand what you're doing right now, but if there's some kind of hidden message here I'm not getting it.
LISA => No shit. You're on your own, Mom.
JOAN => Thanks a lot.
LISA => You're welcome. The PHONE RINGS. Joan picks it up.
LISA => What's the matter?
LISA => What? Is he gonna be --
JOAN => uiet! CURTIS appears. They both watch Joan at the phone. Instead of dissolving, Joan listens, straightens up and calms down as the person on the phone talks.
LISA => OK, I'm really not trying to be funny, but isn't this a Jewish funeral home?
JOAN => I guess they do both. They notice a few too many good-looking women crying a little too hard. Lisa and Joan look at each other. RODRIGO, a handsome slender kid of 20, comes up to Joan. His accent is British, with a slight Colombian cadence.
RODRIGO => Excuse me. Joan?
JOAN => Yes. You must be Rodrigo. Oh my God, oh I'm so sorry. She impulsively embraces him.
JOAN => Rodrigo, this is my --
RODRIGO => I want to tell you, Joan, my Dad talked about you all the time.
JOAN => He did?
RODRIGO => Yes. The night he met you, he called me in England and woke me to tell me about it, he was so excited. I never heard him talk about anyone like that since my mother died.
JOAN => Really?
RODRIGO => I don't know if this is appropriate...
JOAN => No it's OK...!
RODRIGO => .but he went out a lot. Do you know the last time I spoke to him he told me from the moment he met you he knew he wanted to marry you, because for the first time since he lost my mother, he finally met a woman he could really connect with.
JOAN =>  Well -- he was a very sweet man. And I know he loved you and your brother very much.
JOAN => Thanks for coming with me today. I really appreciate it.
LISA => Oh, you're welcome.
JOAN => I don't want to be macabre, but Ramon and I were supposed to go to hear The Tales of Hoffman the week after next and I still have the tickets. Would you be interested in going? Or should I give them away?
LISA => Um, I'll go.
JOAN => OK. It's Monday night. We can dress up.
JOAN => What did you make of that?
JOAN => Well...I think it's pretty unfortunate that you think that. Because I feel like you and I used to relate to each other really well.
LISA => I'm not trying to hurt your feelings. It's just a general observation.
JOAN => OK...Hey, could I get a hug?
LISA => Sure. Lisa rises and hugs Joan. It's not a good hug.
JOAN => I just feel totally at sea. They break apart.
MR AARON => I've thought about this a great deal, and I'm going to come forward.
LISA => Oh brother.
MR AARON => What does that mean?
LISA => "You're gonna come forward." And do what? You didn't kill anybody.
LISA => You just had sex with me after I practically begged you to. You're a guy. "I'm gonna come forward."
MR AARON => Well, that's what I'm comfortable doing.
LISA => Suit yourself. I'll deny everything and you're gonna look like a total psycho.
MR AARON => I'm not sure I know how to do that.
LISA => You'll learn.
LISA => Good news!
JOAN => OK. What do you want to do?
LISA => What do you mean? Aren't JOAN you going to tell me. It's your body. It's your what to do? (half- baby. What do you want to do? laughing) Baby... .?
JOAN => Yes! Now who is the father?
LISA => It could be a lot of people. Joan looks at her. Lisa haltingly holds her ground. Joan takes a sympathetic step toward her. Lisa shrinks back. Joan stops. Her expression hardens.
JOAN => Who.
LISA => I'm never gonna tell you, Mom! It's against my principles! Such as they are.
NURSE => Mrs. Cohen? TRACKING Joan as she gets up and follows the Nurse down a hall...
NURSE => .she's still a little woozy from the anaesthetic... Joan goes into the recovery room. Lisa is on the table in a crumpled paper robe, looking like a small crumpled piece of paper herself. Joan sits down.
LISA => Hi.
JOAN => Hi honey.
LISA => I'm sorry, Mom.
JOAN => Let's talk about it later.
DEUTSCH => I'm very pleased to be able to inform you all that I had a long meeting with the lawyer for the bus company, and they've agreed to settle out of court for three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
DEUTSCH => I'm assuming this is agreeable to
ABIGAIL ROB => Yes, fantastic That is fantastic!
DEUTSCH => But I gotta -- obviously I gotta bring the offer to you, get your approval --
ROB => That's OK --
ABIGAIL => We're only --
EMILY => Abigail? Rob? If we could just listen to
ROB => Yes. Sorry. Fire away.
DEUTSCH => I was gonna say I know there was a concern
ROB => That's OK --
ABIGAIL => We were just --
EMILY => Would you let him talk please?!
DEUTSCH => It's OK.
ABIGAIL => We're sorry.
DEUTSCH => I want to tell you I think it's a very good offer.
DEUTSCH => I think they're very anxious to settle, but I also do think that at this moment they're under the maximum amount of pressure we can really bring to bear, and I don't believe they're gonna come up any higher --
ABIGAIL => Hey. Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars...
ROB => OK, now let me just --
ROB ABIGAIL => I just want to introduce Now, 1 think -- Can the thought -- you all hear me?
ABIGAIL => Yeow! Was that everybody? OK:
LISA => What about --
ABIGAIL => -- Emily? What do you think?
EMILY => I think it sounds like we should do it. But I'd like to discuss some of the --
ROB => Unless you think there's something to be gained from holding out for more.
DEUTSCH => I think it would be a big mistake.
ABIGAIL => Robbie, what do you think?
ROB => Sold!
ABIGAIL => Sold!
DEUTSCH => OK. Now the only down side to this as it stands -- and the reason I asked Emily and Lisa to be here is because I know this may be a serious wrinkle for you all -- is that
LISA => What do you mean?
ROB => The driver?
LISA EMILY => Then forget it. Tell them to What do you mean they forget it. won't discuss the removal of the driver?
DEUTSCH => Please. Ladies. Let me ROB finish what I'm saying. Whoa -- hello!
ABIGAIL => It's just a blast in our ears.
LISA => Finish what? Forget it!
LISA => What does giving us three hundred thousand dollars mean?
DEUTSCH => Settling out of court does not imply an admission of guilt. It simply does not carry the same stigma. On top of that you may not know, Lisa, they're involved in a very tricky labor dispute at the MTA right
LISA => Yeah, we know all about that! Just tell them to forget it.'
DEUTSCH => I know that's your reaction...
LISA => It's the only reason we're here.
ROB => Can I jump in here? Russel?
ROB ABIGAIL => Hello? Are you still with us? Please!
LISA => It's Emily's decision.
EMILY => No.
DEUTSCH => No.
ROB => Hello?
LISA => It's not?
ABIGAIL => They're not listening, Robbie.
DEUTSCH => It's Abigail's decision because she's the next of kin.
LISA => But she didn't even know about it!
EMILY => That doesn't matter.
ABIGAIL => Could we get back in this conversation please?
DEUTSCH => Yes. I'm sorry. Obviously there's some very strong emotions going either way on this --
ABIGAIL => Listen, Emily? I don't know what you're thinking, but Rob and I are thinking we should take Russel's recommendation while we can. Because if they won't fire the guy, they're not gonna fire him. And six months or a year from now we're gonna --
ROB => Exactly.
ABIGAIL => we're gonna be in a situation where we're beggin' them for half this much, which is gonna hurt 'em half as much as now, and they're still not gonna fire this guy! Or maybe he'll have already quit and the whole thing will be moot by then.. Do you see what I mean?
LISA => The entire point of the lawsuit was to get the guy fired so he doesn't kill somebody else -- !
DEUTSCH => Lemme just clarify --
LISA => -- it was not to get you three hundred and fifty thousand dollars you didn't know you were entitled to, for somebody you didn't even like... !
ABIGAIL => This is a distortion --
LISA => And the only reason you're getting the money at all is because I started this whole fucking thing in motion! I'm sorry for swearing, but you should be willing to trade in all the money for getting this guy off the street --
EMILY => For getting him, Abigail!
ABIGAIL => Well I'm sorry, but I have a responsibility to Monica and I take that responsibility very seriously. You are talking about an offer that is gonna be withdrawn if we don't do something about it right now.
ABIGAIL => And rather than being abused over the telephone and cursed at for having the courtesy to involve you in these discussions, Lisa, I would hope you would be guided by our judgement. Unless I'm wrong about that.
LISA => None of that matters --
ABIGAIL => Unless I'm wrong about that. Just what is your interest in this?
LISA => Because I'm the one who killed her! I'm the one who killed her! But at least I know I did it, and that guy has no idea! And he's wandering around blaming everybody else and all I want is for somebody to let him know that what he did was wrong! And if they don't fire him and all you want is the money and the police won't do anything, how is he gonna know he's wrong? You can't take the deal, Abigail! It wasn't so you could get any money, it was because we wanted to get him fired! It doesn't matter about the money! You wouldn't have gotten it before!
ABIGAIL => Well it may not matter to you, but where I come from three hundred and fifty thousand dollars is an awful lot of money, and to my mind is a positive result of all this tragedy and not just negative. Not just getting someone fired for one mistake, no matter how bad it was --
LISA => Oh SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS! She knocks the speaker phone off the desk and runs to the door in floods of tears.
LISA => You sleazy fucking lawyer! And you're a moralistic cunt! She runs out.
BONNIE => Hey, Lisa. What's Up?
- LISA => Hey, did you guys know I had an abortion last week? Pause.
MR AARON => No. I didn't know that.
LISA => Yeah, it cost four hundred dollars.
BONNIE => Um, should I...
MR AARON => No, no, don't go anywhere.
LISA => Yeah, don't go anywhere. Bonnie doesn't know what to make of this. Mr Aaron looks steadily at Lisa.
MR AARON => Do you want to tell us about it?
LISA => Yeah. I do.
MR AARON => OK. -Go ahead.
LISA => Well... She doesn't speak. Pause.
BONNIE => Do your parents know about this, Lisa?
LISA => Yes.
BONNIE => Have you told the father, honey?
LISA => No...There's a couple of people it could be.
MR AARON => I think you better tell them. Whoever they are.
LISA => No...No...Never mind ...I'm sure he's sorry anyway, whichever one he is.
MR AARON => I don't see what difference that makes, if he's sorry. And I think whoever it is should know about this.
LISA => I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought this up. Please don't tell anyone.
BONNIE => We're not gonna tell anyone. But you're gonna have to tell whoever it could be --
LISA =>  That's OK. I gotta go. Thanks for listening. It's -- It doesn't matter about the father, because the whole thing was my fault. I'm sorry...! She shakes her head and runs away.
BONNIE => What was that...?
CURTIS => Mom's looking for you.
LISA => What for?
CURTIS => She thinks you're going out with her tonight.
LISA => Where are we going?
CURTIS => I don't know. Lisa heads for her room. Joan appears, half-dressed.
JOAN => Lisa? Honey? Did you forget we're going to the opera?
LISA => Yes.
JOAN => I didn't-remind you because I didn't want to nag you.
LISA => It's OK.
JOAN => Don't get run over. A cab rattles by. Lisa looks down the street. A BUS is approaching.
LISA => Wait. I want to see if that's him.
JOAN => What. They wait. The bus gets closer, heading straight toward them and stops at the bus stop. Lisa grabs her mother's arm.
LISA => It is him. Mom, that's the one... Joan and Lisa look at him. He's staring out ahead of him as people board the bus. He SEES Lisa and Joan but can't see their faces and doesn't recognize Lisa: He just sees two dolled-up women under the street light. He smiles dazzling at them and drives past with a short wave. Joan looks at Lisa. She looks like she's about to throw up.
JOAN => Come on. We're gonna miss the curtain.
JOAN => Well, so far it's not the greatest opera I ever heard.
LISA => What do you mean? It's OK. The end-of-intermission chimes sound. People start going in. Joan turns and goes in too. Lisa keeps smoking.
